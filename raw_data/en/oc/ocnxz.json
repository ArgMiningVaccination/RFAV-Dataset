based non -profit research and educational organization supporting research of the therapeutic potential of 3,4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). MAPS is the spon sor of clinical trials of MDMA -assisted therapy1 for patients with chronic psychiatric disorders such as Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), social anxiety, and anxiety related to terminal illnesses. In 2014, MAPS formed the MAPS Public Benefit Corporat ion (M APS PBC), a U .S.-based wholly owned subsidiary of MAPS that has been delegated the responsibility of trial organization for all research studies within the MDMA Clinical Development Program. In 2017, MAPS initiated the establishment of MAPS Europe B. V. in the Netherlands as a second wholly owned subsidiary of MAPS. MAPS Europe B.V. is the designated sponsor for studies in the European Economic Area. MDMA -assisted therapy is an experimental treatment that combines psychotherapeutic techniques with adm inistration of MDMA under direct observation as a pharmacological adjunct that enhances therapy . Prior to placement on the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) list of Schedule I substances, MDMA was administered to thousands of people in psychotherapeu tic practice outside of clinical trials. This Investigator's Brochure (IB) provides information on the pharmacology, safety, and efficacy of MDMA. The information presented in this IB summarizes results from published research studies of MDMA conducted by groups outside of the sponsor, sponsor collected data, and published studies and case reports of people who use Ecstasy, unregulated material represented as containing MDMA. In this document, 'MDMA' will be used to refer to drug of known purity used in a c ontrolled setting and 'Ecstasy' will be used to describe drug-related information gathered from epidemiological settings. PTSD is a psychiatric disorder that may occur following a traumatic event such as war, disaster, sexual abuse, violence, terrorism, a nd accidents [1]. Epidemiological studies estimate the lifetime prevalence of PTSD in the U.S. adult population is estimated between 6.1% and 9. 2%, while worldwide lifetime prevalence of PTSD ranges from 1.3% to 12.2% [2, 3]. PTSD reduces quality of life and can affect physical health [4, 5]. Evidence based psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies exist, but may be difficult to tolerate [6-8], and are ineffective for m any individuals with PTSD, with an estimated 40 to 60% of patients remaining symptomatic and meeting diagnostic criteria even after receiving treatment [8-10]. In addition, available pharmacotherapies used to t reat PTSD may have problematic side effects and generally require long-term and/or consistent use to maintain effectiveness [7]. Novel interventions are needed to better treat people with PTSD. MDMA -assisted therapy might also serve as a tolerable treatment that requires only a handful of administrations with lasting treatment effects. MDMA is a ring -substituted phenethylamine also known as methylenedioxymethamphetamine. MDMA is structurally similar to, but functionally distinct, from amphetamines. MDMA is a chiral molecule and the hydrochloride (HCl) salt of racemic anhydrous MDMA is under development for marketing. The drug product is formulated as a white crystalline powder compounded with excipients and placed in capsules. The HCl salt of MDMA is readily water soluble and hydro philic. Due to a wide range of responses to identica l dosing [11], the sponsor's 1 The treatment \"MDMA psychotherapy\" has been updated to \"MDMA - assisted therapy\" which more appropriately reflects the standard terminology for psychological treatments in the PTSD field, though MDMA -assisted psychotherapy is still accurate and both names may appear in documents as this change is implemented. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 12 of 253 human trials use fixed doses equivalent to between 1 and 4 mg/kg MDMA HCl (active doses in studies range from 75 mg to 225 mg). Onset of MDMA effects occurs 30 to 60 minutes after oral administration [12, 13], peak effects appear 75 to 120 minutes post -drug [11, 14-16], and duration of effects lasts from 3 to 6 hours [14, 15, 17], with most effects returning to baseline or near - baseline levels 6 hours after drug administration. The elimination half -life of active doses of MDMA is 7 to 9 hours [18]. The pharmacokinetics of MDMA in humans has been characterized using oral doses of up to 150 mg MDMA HCl, and disposition follows nonlinear pharmacokinetics. Metabolism N -demethylation -methylened ioxyamphetamine (MDA). The parent 3,4 and HHA are O methylated mainly to These four metabolites, particularly HMMA and HMA, are known to be excreted in the urine as conjugated glucuronide or sulfate metabolites [18]. MDMA concomitantly promotes release, inhibits reuptake, and extends duration of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in reuptake inhibitor, and similar drugs in this class have been found to exert potent anti -depressant activity with a favorable safety profile in clinical tria ls [19, 20]. MDMA produces anxiolytic and prosocial effects through release of the monoaminergic neurotransmitters, with the greatest effect on serotonin, followed by norepinephrine and dopamine [21-25]. Subjective effects of MDMA can include increased compassion for self and others, reduced defenses and fear of emotional injury, and making unpleasant memories less disturbing while enhancing communication and capacity for introspection [26-29]. These factors taken together provide the opportunity for a corrective emotional experience in the context of therapy . Many of the therapeutic effects of MDMA - assisted therapy are evident within a short period of treatment, often after the initial session. Increased feelings of interpersonal closeness, changes in social perception, and reduced anxiety might make MDMA a suitable phar macological adjunct to enhance therapy for treatment of anxiety disorders, such as PTSD, social anxiety, and anxiety associated with other conditions. MAPS completed a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial (MAPP1) in 2020 demonstrating the efficacy and safety o f MDMA -assisted therapy for treatment of PTSD [30]. double -blind, placebo -controlled , multi -site study, participants with severe PTSD were treated using divided doses of 80 mg to 180 mg MDMA HCl. Therapy in conjunction with MDMA was statistically superior for PTSD treatment as measured by a decrease in CAPS -5 severity scores from Baseline to 2 months after three blinded dosing sessions in comparison to therapy paired with an inactive placebo . These findings are supported by the sponsor's earlier Phase 2 clinical trials to develop the medical use of MDMA -assisted therapy for patients with chronic PTSD [31]. Large placebo - subtracted effect sizes, indications of efficacy in a Phase 3 trial , and favorable safety outcomes led to the approval of MDMA for the treatment of PTSD as a Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) by the FDA in 2017 for expedited drug development [32]. A long -term follow -up of participants at least 12 months later found a low relapse rate and that benefits outweighed risks associated with treatment [33]. As of October 01, 2021 , with 358 individuals exposed to MDMA in the development program across various indications and at least 1,441 participants in MDMA research studies conducted without sponsor sup port (for a total of at least 1,799 individuals) , the sponsor has observed an acceptable risk -benefit ratio for MDMA -assisted therapy. There have been no unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SARs) to date and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) have been rare. As of MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 13 of 253 March 01, 2022 , a single expected SAR (increased ventricular extrasystoles), has been reported in MAPS -sponsored clinical trials. The most prevalent Treatment -emergent Adverse Events (TEAE s) related to MDMA in the pivotal Phase 3 trial MAPP1 were muscle tightness, decreased appetite, nausea, hyperhidrosis, and feeling cold [30]. Safety findings from MAPP1 were comparable to the Adverse Events ( AEs) profile reporte d in the pooled Phase 2 analysis [31]. Most AE s were mild to moderate in severity , lasted no longer than 7 days , and did not require any treatment . Of note, no increase in suicidality was reported in the MDMA group ( see Section 6.4.1 Adverse Events ). Safety findi ngs for other indications were explored in a Phase 2 social anxiety study in autistic adults (N=12, MAA -1) [34, 35], and a Phase 2 anxiety study in participants w ith a life - threatening illness (N=21, MDA -1). (See Table 4: Summary of Completed Sponsor Supported Studies with MDMA ) Data from MAPS studies and other researchers ' published literature support that MDMA produces sympathomimetic eff ects that include transient, self -limiting increases in heart rate (HR) and blood pressure that were well -tolerated by healthy volunteers [11, 13-15, 36-42]. Similar transient effects were observed in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in participants with PTSD [30, 31]. Most people did not experience elevations that exceeded those seen after moderate exercise. Risks posed by elevated blood pressure were addressed by excluding candidates with a histo ry of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular disease, or with pre -existing uncontrolled hypertension, and by regularly monitoring blood pressure and pulse throughout dosing sessions . Common reactions from MDMA reported in the literature and clinical trials were t ransient and diminished as drug effects waned during the session and over the next one to seven days. MDMA may reduce responsiveness to changes in water/salt balance after normal and increased water consumption [43]. MDMA is also a mild immunosuppressant [44]. However, the clinical relevance of this observation is not clear as a r eview of infections, particularly upper respiratory tract infections ( URTI ) in the time of the COVID -19 pandemic did not reveal an increase in the MDMA groups compared to placebo (see Section 6.4.1.3 Adverse Events Summary ). PTSD is a serious, chronic, life -threatening condition that afflicts a substantial number of individuals who are more likely to exhibit increased risk of suicide, psychiatric comorbid ities, cardiovascular disease, and functional impairment. Those who suffer from PTSD are often insufficiently treated with available therapies. In MAPS' clinical trials to date, MDMA has been well-tolerated and has reduced symptoms of PTSD. In summary, res ults from clinical studies to date suggest a favorable risk/benefit profile among PTSD participant s treated with a two to three - session MDMA -assisted therapy , which also included follow -up non -drug therapy sessions. Therefore, MDMA -assisted therapy might b e a novel treatment option with the potential for sustained improvements after only a handful of sessions. 2.0 Introduction MDMA is not a novel compound. It was first synthesized and patented by Merck in 1912 [45] and is currently not covered by a patent. MAPS holds the Drug Master File (DMF) and an Investigational New Drug (IND) file for MDMA with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). After MDMA was rediscovered by the chemist Alexander Shulgin in 1976 [46], he and his colleagues provi ded initial reports of its pharmacology, with 80 mg to 160 mg MDMA HCl required to produce desired subjective effects in humans [47, 48]. MDMA was found to robustly influence human emotional status in a unique way [48] without adversely affecting physiological functions or perception, such as visual perception or cognition [12, 14, 16, 17]. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 14 of 253 MDMA possesses a complex pharmacological profile that is dominated by its effects as a monoamine releaser and reuptake inhibitor, with additional effects on limiting neurotransmitter production and degradation. Its prominent effects on serotonin differenti ate it from amphetamine and methamphetamine, which primarily act on norepinephrine and dopamine pathways [21, 49]. In the Merck Index, MDMA resides in the Entactogen class [50]. Entactogens contain a ring - substituted amphetamine core, belong to the phenethylamine class of psychoactive drugs, and are described as pro moting acceptance and compassion for self and others, changing recognition and response to emotions, and increased interpersonal closeness [27, 51-53]. In comparison to anxiolytics, antidepressants and atypical antipsychotics, steady state levels in blood are not required for MDMA to function as a catalyst to therapy . Shulgin and Nichols were the first to report the effec ts of MDMA in humans [48]. Reported effects of MDMA include enhanced feelings of closeness to others, well -being, and insightfulness [54-56]. MDMA was used in the 1970s an d 1980s to enhance therapy for individuals, couples, and groups to treat various psychological disorders, including moderate depression and anxiety [55, 57-59]. It was also found to be useful in reducing physical pain secondary to certain kinds of cancer [58]. No formal controlled clinical trials of safety and efficacy were conducted at the time [55, 60]. During the early 1980s, increasing numbers of people began using MDMA, sold as 'Ecstasy ', outside of therapeutic contexts [61]. In the U.S., an estimated 6.8 % of peo ple aged 12 years and above reported using 'Ecstasy' (material represented as containing MDMA) at least once in their lifetimes [62], and an estimated 4% of Europeans aged 15 to 64 reported lifetime Ecstasy use [63]. MDMA was added to the list of Schedule I controlled substances in the U.S. in 1985, defining it as a drug with a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use [64, 65]. Classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, combined with the early research in animals and recreational users, hampered clinical research for medical uses of MDMA until the 1990s. Adverse r eports following use of Ecstasy have raised safety conc erns regarding MDMA administration, including hyperthermia [66-68], changes in serotonin transporter (SERT) density, and impaired memory and executive function [69-73]. However uncontrolled studie s of Ecstasy use and nonclinical animal studies at doses significantly greater than the therapeutic dose range of MDMA yielded findings that are open to an array of interpretations [74, 75]. The vast majority of publications on Ecstasy users are retr ospective reports in polydrug -users who are using drugs of unknown purity and quality [76, 77]. Initial human studies from the 1990s focused on physiological effe cts of MDMA from a safety perspective, and current investigations have examined the effects on attention, prosocial effects, memory and brain activity, and human drug discrimination. Findings from an initial sponsor - funded study indicated that MDMA -assiste d therapy could be conducted safely in people with chronic PTSD who had failed first line treatments [78]. This was demonstrated in a chronic, treatment -resistant PTSD sample in a sponsored placebo -controlled study (MP -1) [79], which demonstrated durable improvement in PTSD severity . In this study, MDMA had no deleterious effects on cognitive function or safety pharmacology laboratory results when given on two occasions, spaced 1 month apart. In addition, placebo -controlled Phase 1 clinical trials confirmed that the active doses of MDMA produce an easily controlled state characterized by euphoria, increased well -being, sociability, self -confidence, extro version, transient increases in anxiety, and minor alterations in perception [12, 14-16, 80-84]. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 15 of 253 MAPS has completed ten Phase 2 and one Phase 3 investigations of MDMA -assisted therapy for treatment of PTSD ( see Table 4: Summary of Completed Sponsor Supported Studies with MDMA ). The pooled Phase 2 efficacy results in PTSD participants indicate that MDMA -assisted therapy administered in a controlled clinical setting demonstrated that the treatment was safe and efficacious among patients with moderate to severe PTSD [31, 33]. Durable improvements in PTSD symptom severity were found at least 12 months after the last dosing session in 91 participants who received a therapeutically active dose of MDMA in these studies, and 67% did not meet PTSD diagnostic criteria per CAPS -4 assessment [33]. Though the interpretation of long-term results might be limited due to a lack of a blinded control group at this time point, the results suggest significant durable improvement in PTSD symptoms that lasted for at least 12 months for many participants following MDMA -assisted therapy . A re port from a pilot study of a combination of MDMA -assisted therapy with a form of conjoint cognitive behavioral therapy geared toward dyads is now complete (MPVA -1) [85]. The findings from two open -label and MP17), testing the modality of MDMA -assisted therapy in PTSD in two multi -site clinical trials to assess the feasibility of scaling across 14 Nort h American sites demonstra ted that the observed treatment response to MDMA -assisted therapy can be scaled and replicated by newly trained therap y teams across multiple sites [86]. These Phase 2 clinical studies in participant s with PTSD supported the design of Phase 3 clinical studies for treatment of PTSD with MDMA -assisted therapy [87]. Ongoing Phase 2 studies include three investigations of MDMA -assisted therapy for people with PTSD : one in U.S. veterans (MPVA6) , a multi -site study in Europe (MP18) , and an open -label safety extension crossover study among Phase 3 participants (MAPPUSX) . Long -term follow -up studies examining durability of response to therapy with MDMA or placebo among recent Phase 2 and 3 study participants are also underway (MPLONG and MPELONG). The studies taking place in Europe are intended to prepare sites in Europe for Phase 3 studies. Planned Phase 2 studies include an open -label feasibility and safety study of MDMA -assisted group therapy for the treatment of PTSD in veterans (MPG1 ) and an open -label Expanded Access Program of MDMA -assisted therapy for treatment -resistant PTSD patients (EAMP1). 3 -controlled MDMA -assisted therapy trial, MAPP1, was c ompleted in October 2020 , with 90 participant s treated in at least 1 blinded dosing session at fifteen study sites in the U.S., Canada, and Israel (see Table 4: Summary of Completed Sponsor Supported Studies with MDMA ). This trial demonstrated that PTSD symptoms were significantly attenuated by MDMA -assisted therapy and confirmed findings seen in Phase 2 studies. MDMA as an adjunct to supportive therapy was statistically superior for PTSD treatment in CAPS -5 severity sco res from Baseline to 2 months after three blinded dosing sessions in comparison to therapy paired with an inactive placebo [30]. This finding was supported by a positive secondary efficacy result in reducing clinician -rated functional impairment , as measured by the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). There were no new safety signals found in MAPP1 compared to the previously observed IMP safety profile , including no increase in reported adverse events of special i nterest in the categories of suicidal ideation or behavior, cardiovascular, or abuse potential in the MDMA group as compared to the therapy with placebo control group. Responder analysis indicated that at the primary endpoint, 88% of participants in the MD MA group had a clinically significant improvement with 67% of participants no longer meeting diagnostic criteria for PTSD, compared to 62% with clinically significant improvement and 32% with loss of diagnosis in the placebo group. There a re ongoing Phase 3 studies, including a confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trial (MAPP2) , encompassing a sample of participants with moderate to severe PTSD . An additional Phase 3 study is under development in Europe (MAPP3) and will investigate MDMA -assisted the rapy for people with at least moderate PTSD (see Table 5: Summary of Ongoing and Planned Sponsor Supported Studies with MDMA ). MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 16 of 253 Additional Phase 1 MDMA research studies supported by the sponsor include a randomized, placebo -controlle d, double -blind study of the effects of MDMA on startle response (MPVA -4) completed in 2020 [88], an ongoing placebo -controlled, double -blind crossover study to assess the psychological effects of MDMA -assisted therapy and to expand the knowledge of therapists training to conduct MDMA -assisted therapy research (MT-1) and a planned open -label companion study (MT2), a planned study of the effects of fasting on M DMA pharmacokinetics (MPKF) , and a planned study of MDMA pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers and people with impaired liver function (MPKH), deferred as a post -marketing commitment (see Table 5: Summary of Ongoing and Planned Spon sor Supported Studies with MDMA ). Based on clinical experience with PTSD, MAPS is currently exploring additional indications for this treatment that share anxiety as an element or feature of the condition, or that may benefit from a greater ability to co nfront emotional thoughts and memories. Two studies have been completed exploring the use of MDMA -assisted therapy for social anxiety in autistic adults [89]and MDMA -assisted therapy to address anxiety associated with a life -threatening illness [90]. A planned Phase 2 investigation of the safety and effectiveness of MDMA -assisted therapy for treatment f or people with eating disorders is also underway (MED -1). This IB present s available nonclinical and epidemiological data on MDMA and on data collected from sponsor -initiated studies through October 01, 2021 . The addition of th ese data has confirmed the improved benefit /risk profile of MDMA -assisted therapy over therapy with placebo in a larger sample size and with an adequate and well -controlled study since the last edition of this IB. 3.0 Physical, Chemical, and Pharmaceutical Properties and Formulation MDMA is the short form of the name 3,4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) nomenclature is (RS) -1-(benzo[d][1,3]dioxol -5- yl)-N-methylpropan -2-amine, and the United States Adopted Name (US AN) is midomafetamine hydrochloride. MDMA is structurally similar to, but functionally distinct from , amphetamines and mescaline has the of C 11H15NO 2. MDMA is a chiral molecule, possessing two enantiomers, S(+) -MDMA and R( -)-MDMA, S(+)-MDMA being more potent than R( -)-MDMA [91, 92]. Research in humans to date and th e majority of nonclinical studies have used racemic MDMA, or an admixture containing equal amounts of both enantiomers. The current manufacturing process is using achiral methods and produces racemic MDMA. The sponsor is developing the racemic anhydrous hy drochloride salt of MDMA for marketing. The salt of MDMA is readily water soluble with a pKa of 9.9 [93]. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 17 of 253 Figure 1: Chemical Structure of MDMA MDMA doses in sponsor -supported early Phase 1 and 2 studies are fixed within the initial therapeutic dose range of 75 mg to 125 mg MDMA HCl , rather than dosing by body weight, based on initial publications information and lack of linear dose response with behavioral effects in Phase 1 and sponsor -supported studies [11]. The clinical dose tested in Phase 3 trials is a divided dose ranging from an initial dose of 80 mg to 120 mg MDMA HCl and a divided dose of 120 mg to 180 mg MDMA HCl , which is equivalent to 1.1 mg/kg to 1.8 mg/kg based on the initial dose for a 70 kg person. As previous sponsored studies and most non -sponsor supported clinical and animal studies list the dosage strength of MDMA as a hydrochloride (HCl) salt, dosage st rength is reported throughout the IB as MDMA HCl. Both HCl salt and active moiety values are listed for doses used in clinical studies conducted by the sponsor in Appendix Table 23: MDMA Salt to Active Moiety Conversion . In Novembe r 2018, the sponsor released a clinical batch of Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) at the dosage strength of 40 mg and 60 mg MDMA HCl , manufactured according to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), and all subsequent sponsor ed studies follow this standard. Up to 36 months stability data at 25\u00b0 C/60%RH and up to 6 months data at 40\u00b0C/75%RH are available on the drug substance batch of MDMA HCl used to manufacture this clinical IMP batch . No significant degradation has been detected under any of t hese conditions. MDMA (as hydrochloride salt) in the form of off -white crystalline powder is compounded with the excipient mannitol and the lubricant magnesium stearate. The blend is then encapsulated in hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) capsules of 40 and 60 mg MDMA HCl. Placebo to match consists of mannitol and magnesium stearate. A new clinical batch was released in October 2021. Stability data are available on the current cGMP batches and cover up to 6 months under accelerated storage conditions 40\u00b0C/75% RH, up to 36 months under long term storage conditions 25\u00b0C/60% RH in cold form aluminum blister packs, and 24 months under long term storage conditions 25\u00b0C/60% RH in HDPE wide mouth bottles with HDPE SecuRx child resistant closures. The stability protocols for storage under long - term conditions (25\u00b0C/60% RH) in cold form aluminum blister packs are complete for the 60 mg MDMA HCl capsules whereas the stability protocols for the 40 mg MDMA HCl capsules in cold form aluminum blister packs are still ongoing and will be running up to 60 months. The stability protocols in HDPE bottles are also ongoing and will be running for up to 36 months. To support evaluation of stability unde r more extreme temperature deviations during shipping, the stability of the capsules has been studied for 1 week at both -20\u00b0C and 50\u00b0C/75% RH. No degradation was observed. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 18 of 253 The most current stability results for 40 mg and 60 mg MDMA HCl capsules (equivale nt to 34 mg and 50 mg of MDMA) after 36 months or 24 months storage at 25\u00b0C/60% RH in aluminum blister strips or HDPE bottles respectively show no evidence of change in appearance, assay, or impurities in the capsules. Moisture remains at a low level and t here is no trend of dissolution data. All results comply with specifications. Optimization of the API synthetic route has been conducted to manufacture the Phase 3 cGMP MDMA HCl and a high yielding process that reproducibly provides material within the specifications has been achieved [94]. Follo wing the manufacture of a small -scale batch (5 L) in August 2020 and a commissioning batch in October 2020, three consecutive process validation batches were manufactured with this optimized manufacturing process at the commercial scale (50 L) in November 2020. This cGMP API material was used to manufacture the new cGMP IMP batch of 40 mg and 60 mg MDMA HCl capsules released in October 2021 . Based on the available stability data , a shelf life of 36 months and retest date April 2024 has been assigned to this clinical drug product batch with recommended storage at ambient temperature up to 30\u00b0C. MDMA HCl does not require special conditions for storage. Drug product capsules are produced under cGMP . The capsules are packaged in aluminum cold -formed blister s trips or in HDPE bottles . The containers are typically placed in a safe at room temperature in a dry, clean, well - ventilated space at temperatures between 15 to 30\u00b0C . Short-term deviations between 5 to 30\u00b0C are allowed based on available stability data. As a Schedule I controlled substance, MDMA is stored and handled in compliance with relevant federal or national, state, provincial and local regulations. License holders are responsible for administration and dispensing of the MDMA for approved uses only. They are responsible for ensuring that it is stored securely in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. DEA and other relevant international regulatory authorities. 4.0 Nonclinical Studies 4.1 Nonclinical Pharmacology Findings from nonclinical animal and in vitro research are presented. Research into the pharmacological, physiological, or psychological effects of MDMA began in the 1950s, when the U.S. Army administered MDMA to guinea pigs, monkeys, mice, rats, and dogs as part of a military research program, possibly intending to develop chemical incapacitants or means of enhancing interrogation [95]. Investigations of the pharmacology, functional effects, and toxicity of MDMA in animals have generally included injections of large and often repeated doses of MDMA that are not human -equivalent d oses. Studies of MDMA have been conducted in primates and rodents. Primate species studied include baboon, macaque, rhesus monkey, and squirrel monkey, and rodents include mice and rats. Studies of circadian rhythm have occurred in hamsters [96]. Beginning in the mid -2000s onwards, reports re -examining these effects have questioned the applicability of allometric interspecies scaling models for MDMA [74, 97, 98]. MDMA possesses a complex pharmacological profile that is dom inated by its effects as a monoamine releaser and reuptake inhibitor. Its prominent serotonergic effects differentiate it from amphetamine and methamphetamine, which primarily act on dopamine and norepinephrine [21, 49]. MDMA also has a complex profile from a pharmacokinetics perspective and has been demonstrated in multiple animal models to follow nonlinear pharmacokinetics, with increased doses resulting in disproportionate increase in exposure to the parent compound (see Section 4.2 Pharmacodynamic and Product Metabolism in Animals ). Additionally, MDMA exhibits pharmacodynamic drug interactions with other drugs commonly used in psychiatry. In the MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 19 of 253 following sections, the pharmacology of MDMA is presented based on nonclinical animal studies from both primary literature and sponsor conducted studies. A full listing of completed nonclinical studies conducted by MAPS is available below (Table 1 ).

MDMA appears to alter the conformation of the transporters, enabling monoamines to diffuse out of the neuron rather than being actively transported into the presynaptic neuron [49, 101-103]. MDMA prevents the reuptake of serotonin, and to a lesser extent, norepinephrine and dopamine, and facilitates release of these neurotransmitters [49, 104-106]. The selectivity of MDMA for specific monoaminergic neurotransmitters is species -dependent and cannot solely be attributed to differences in binding affinity for specific reuptake transporters observed in vitro , as described below. In in vitro studies, MDMA was also found to compete with monoamines for sites on the vesicular monoamine transporter -2 (VMAT2), suggesting MDMA also promotes active release of monoamines from vesicular stores, in addition to inhibiting reuptake [107-109]. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 22 of 253 MDMA can inhibit monoamine oxidase A (MAO -A) in vitro at high concentrations, which preferentially degrades serotonin, and leads to synaptic cleft [110, 111]. Inhibition of MAO -A may have played a role in fatalities and medical emergencies seen after combining Ecstasy with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI ) in epidemiol ogical Spurred on by pri or reports hypothesizing that apparent greater serotonergic toxicity of MDMA in primates, as compared to rodents, could be attributed to greater SERT affinity [114], researchers specifically examined affinity in cells transfected to express human monoamine transporters [106, 115]. These studies found that even though binding affinity of MDMA for the hum an norepinephrine transporter (NET) exceeded the affinity for SERT and dopamine transporters (DAT), serotonin was preferentially released over norepinephrine and dopamine [106], which may account for primarily serot onergic effects of MDMA. On the other hand, in rodents MDMA affinities for transporters are ordered as SERT>NET>DAT [116]. MDMA does not have as strong an affinity for the DAT as methamphetamine [21]. The ability of MDMA to stimulate release of pre -synaptic serotonin, norepinephrine , and dopamine in multiple brain regions and inhibit reuptake has been well documented [117]. In vivo microdialysis and voltammetry results show significant enhancement of serotonin, and to a lesser extent dopamine following MDMA administration, a response attenuated by various transporter inhibitors. MDMA -stimulated serotonin and dopamine release has bee n the striatum, nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex ( freely moving rats [118- 122], including after administering 0.32 to 3.2 mg/kg MDMA HCl [122]. Female rats exhibited longer duration of n ucleus accumbens dopamine, and longer duration of serotonin after 1 and 3.2 mg/kg MDMA HCl. In addition, enhancement of Acetylcholine (Ach) release has been demonstrated in the PFC, striatum, and hippocampus by both a dopaminergic and serotonergic dependent mechanism [123, 124]. The subjective and physiological effects of MDMA are produced by the dynamic interaction of these transmitter systems on numerous brain networks that modulate learning and memory, emotion, reward, attention, sympath etic/parasympathetic activity, and neuroplasticity. In addition to carrier -mediated monoamine release, MDMA has affinity in vitro for specific serotonin, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, and histamine receptors, although the concentrations tested may not t ranslate to standard human MDMA doses [24, 125-127]. An in vitro binding study comparing MDMA with several drugs that include cathinone derivatives suggests that contrary to an earlier report of low affinity for 5HT 2A serotonin receptors, MDMA may have likely modulates 5HT 1A receptors indirectly through serotonin release, though it is possible that MDMA may also act as a partial 5HT 1A agonist in some brain areas [128]. Findings from other studies suggest that MDMA shares qualities with 5HT 1A agonists. Early studies in rats suggest tha t pharmacological activation of 5HT 1A receptors reduce anxiety and aggression [129, 130], and some drug discrimination studies suggest that 1A agonist 8 -hydroxy -2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin partially substitutes for MDMA [131-133]. Findings from drug discrimination studies in rats suggest dose -dependent differences in the role of the serotonergic versus the dopaminergic system, with rats trained on 1.5 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors ( as similar while rats trained on 3.0 mg/kg recognized amphetamine as similar, and rats trained on both doses recognizing 5HT 1A- related compounds as similar. Training with 1.5 mg/kg but not 3.0 mg/kg MDMA HCl resulted in considering higher doses of a 5HT 2A agonist as similar [134]. The same research team determined that dopamine antagonists interfered with the stimul us properties of amphetamine, but not MDMA [135]. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 23 of 253 4.1.2 Secondary Pha rmacodynamics MDMA has been shown to have a diverse array of secondary pharmacodynamics in animals. Both enantiomers of MDMA enhance Ach release in the PFC [124, 136] and promote changes in GABAergic systems that correlate with sociability [137]. There is some evidence that 5HT 2B receptors are involved in stimulating increased locomotor activity in mice, reported in studies administering 20 mg/kg [138]. At least some direct or indirect effects of MDMA on serotonin receptors may alter GABA uptake in the ventral tegmental area of rats [139]. An in vitro study found that S -MDMA showed signs of competitive interaction with the alpha -4 beta -2 nicotinic receptor which are implicated in learning [140], while R -MDMA did not produce this effect [141]. Infusion of serotonin in the rat brain stimulat es secretion of oxytocin into peripheral blood via activation of 5HT 1A, 5HT 2C, and 5HT 4 receptor subtypes, as as AVP secretion via activation of 5HT 5HT 4, and 5HT 7 receptor subtypes was to increase norepinephrine release through reuptake inhibition, which is an additional pathway that can contribute to oxytocin secretion and may control emotion regulation. Both oxytocin and AVP are implicat ed in the widespread regulation of behavioral aspects of mood and act on different target organs to modulate physiological functions in the periphery [146]. Drug -discrimination and pre - pulse inhibition studies in rats lacking a SERT gene confirm the i mportance of the serotonin transporter in the interoceptive effects of 5 or 10 mg/kg MDMA HCl, and its enhancement of pre - pulse inhibition [147]. In rats, 10 or 20 mg/kg analog) and prolactin [148-150], with elevations lasting up to 4 hours after dosing, and with hormone levels attenuated by a 5HT 2A serotonin receptor antagonist. Given the dosage used was five to 10. 7 times larger than an active dose in humans, it is unclear if this response is analogous to elevated cortisol in humans or whether it reflects a different process. Administering 1 to 3 mg/kg doses found that R( -)-MDMA, but not S(+) -MDMA, significantly inc reased prolactin levels in rhesus monkey plasma, suggesting that at least the R( -) enantiomer of MDMA can influence endocrine signaling at doses relevant for studies in humans [23]. Fluoxetine attenuated prolactin release after after -)-MDMA, indicating that prolactin release is associated with serotonin release and indirect action on 5HT 2A receptors by R( -) -MDMA [151]. MDMA has been shown to have significant effects outside the central nervous system; namely on the cardiovascular, osmoregulatory , and immune systems. MDMA has been shown to cause increases in blood pressure and heart rate in small mammals and primates. These effects are possibly controlled through increased sympathomimetic activity via beta adrenergic receptors [102, 152, 153]. For further information on the cardiac effects in animals see Section 4.1.3.2 Cardiovascular System . MDMA has also been shown to effect water regulation by activation of the AVP system [154], thus explaining the increased thirst seen in humans. For more information on the mechanism of the osmoregulatory effects of MDMA see Section 4.1.3.5 Renal Syst em. Additionally, MDMA has been observed to have some mild immunosuppressant effects in animals. Possible mechanisms include central regulation via the HPA axis and suppression of vario us circulating cytokines and interleukins. For more information see Section 4.3.6.1 Immunological Effects . MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 24 of 253 4.1.3 Safety Pharmacology Safety pharmacology studies are defined as those studies that investigate the potential undesirable pharmacodynamic effects of a substance on physiological functions in relation to exposure in the therapeutic range and above. The purpose of the safety pharmacology core battery is to investigate the effects of the test substance on v ital functions. Safety pharmacology studies were conducted with the racemic mixture of the parent compound, as the finished product formulations for clinical usage do not substantially alter the pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics of the active substa nce. Intravenous MDMA doses that cause lethality in 50% of the cases, known as the LD 50, are 97 mg/kg MDMA HCl in mice, 49 mg/kg in rats, 14 to 18 mg/kg in dogs, and 22 mg/kg in monkeys [95]. LD 50 may vary across strains, sexes, and housing conditions [155-157]. For exampl e, LD 50 in mice housed together is 20 mg/kg, which is considerably lower than in isolated animals [158, 159]. Considerable variation across st udies in environmental factors, that are often underspecified in published reports, contribute to challenges in extrapolating findings in animal studies to humans. The majority of these studies employed multiple dosing regimens to account for the shorter drug half-life in animals compared to humans, with doses ranging from 5 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg, via s.c., i.p., p.o., or gavage administration. Frequently, doses are admi nistered at regular intervals of two to four times per day. Other regimens employ these doses once daily for 5 or 7 days. Doses were selected through use of simple dose conversions or allometric scaling, a method of modeling human equivalent doses in other species [160]. Comparison of pharmacokinetic parameters requires consideration of route of administration for dose conversions between species ( see Table 2 Pharmacokinetic Constants for Plasma MDMA After Various Routes of Administration to Humans or Animals). 4.1.3.1 Central Nervous System Most nonclinical research with MDMA has focused on the CNS effects on serotonergic neurons, while other studies have examined changes in neurohormones or effects on neuroplasticity. It appears that single doses of MDMA HCl (2.5 mg/kg s.c. in squirrel monkeys, 7.5 mg/kg i.p. in rats), approximately 1.5 to 2x of a single human equivalent dose of 100 mg to 150 mg MDMA HCl based on exposure levels, correlates with regional reduction in brain serotonin for 2 weeks or more [97] but does not increase validated markers of neurotoxicity associated with neurodegeneration [98]. Monkeys allowed to self -administer MDMA for an 18 -month period had no reductions in brain dopamine, slight reductions in brain serotonin, and no chemical markers of neuronal injury [161]. One report detected a reduction in N -acetylaspartate to creatine ratio, which the authors considered a sign of neuronal injury, although no decreases in brain serotonin were detected after administration of two 1 mg/kg doses of MDMA HCl to rhesus monkeys for 2 days [162]. Studies in rodents and primates suggest that repeated chronic exposure to high doses of MDMA have the potential to reduce regional serotonin, damage serotonin axons and cause neurotoxicity [102, 114, 163-168] and promote 5 or 10 mg/kg i.p. MDMA HCl given daily for a week, but not after 2.5 mg/kg i.p. [169]. Serotonin syndrome is defined as an excess of serotonin in the CNS causing a suite of specific signs and symptoms that can require intervention [170-172]. Repeated d oses of 10 mg/kg administered s.c. and i.p., but not 2 mg/kg, produced signs of serotonin syndrome in rats at supratherapeutic doses , but neither dose reduced total serotonin levels in the brain 2 weeks after drug administration. When observed, s erotonin syndrome severity correlates with MDMA plasma concentrations [74]. MDMA appear s to alter MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 25 of 253 regulation of serotonergic signaling in the rat brain without producing damage to serotonin axons, based on transient reductions in forebrain (striatum, hippocampus, and cortex) serotonin and SERT protein levels, of indicators of CNS neuronal injury /degeneration [75]. MDMA doses that produce d substantial, long -lasting reductions in serotonin and other serotonergic markers d id not reliably provoke astroglial or microglial changes . This study subsequently found that 4 x 10 mg/kg s.c. MDMA HCl in rats reduc ed gene expression of VMAT -2, TPH -2, and SERT , in the absence of axon terminal degeneration and the presence of acute reactive synaptogenesis [75]. A long-term chronic dosing study in monkeys that counted rates of different types of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) combined with immunohistochemistry detected signs of reduced neurogenesis, but n o signs of apoptosis, in the hippocampi after an intermittent regimen of ascending doses of MDMA HCl from 0.5 to 2.5 mg/kg approximately every 2 weeks for up to 10 months [173]. In a MAPS -sponsored pilot repeated dose 13 -day toxicity study (EMD -AT-001), test ing increasing doses ra nging from 25 mg/kg to 300 mg/kg MDMA HCl , no changes were found in the brain tissue of treated rats compared to controls. The subsequent definitive GLP 28-day repeated dose toxicity study in rats [100] found vacuolar changes in the brainstem adjacent to the trigeminal nuclei in 1 of 10 animals receiving 50 mg/kg /day of MDMA HCl and similar changes in 5 of 10 male rats receiving 100 mg/kg /day [100]. No changes were observed in female animals. The definitive 28 -day repeated dose toxicity study in dogs [174] also found possible changes in the CNS of MDMA -treated dogs with doses of 3, 9 , and 15 mg/kg /day, however the effect was not dose -dependent, suggesting that they could be background events. These possible changes included white matter changes, neural malacia , and cellular infiltrates of the was observed in the brainstem. The pathogenesis of these changes was unknown. Serotonergic axons can be resistant to silver staining [75], provid ing an alternate explanation for these inconclusive findings . A MAPS -sponsored follow -up repeat dose neurotoxicity study administering Sprague -Dawley rats 40 mg/kg or 80 mg/kg of p.o. MDMA HCl twice a day for 4 days showed no morphological brain changes (EMD -SC-003). Neurochemical brain changes related to MDMA administration included a 50% decrease in serotonin (5 -HT) and 5 -Hydroyindoleacetic acid (5 -HIAA) at both dosing levels. This decrease was apparent both 2 and 4 weeks after exposure . A temporary 34% decrease in homovanillic acid (HVA) was observed in the 80 mg/kg group at 2 weeks after treatment. Four weeks after treatment the HVA levels had returned to normal. These findings indicate that repeated high dos e administrations of MDMA 2x per day over 4 days produce long - term reductions up to 4 weeks later in 5-HT and 5 -HIAA in the rat while having no apparent effect on the dopaminergic system [174]. These studies were supplemented with MAPS -sponsored definitive GLP follow -up Extended Single -Dose Neurotoxicology studies in the rat and the dog to conclusively study neurotoxicity with modern experimental methods (see Table 5 Summary of Ongoing and Planned Sponsor Supported Trials with MDMA ). In Study 2884 -001, Sprague 2, mg/kg p.o. MDMA (with correction factor for HCl salt) once weekly for 4 weeks . There was no evidence of CNS lesions at any do se level based on expanded neurohistopathology through the MTD . In Study mg/kg p.o. MDMA (with correction factor for HCl salt) once weekly for 4 weeks . This study also found no evidence of CNS lesions at any dose level , based on expanded neurohistopathology through the MTD . An interim necropsy was performed on selected animals at Day 2 to examine single -dose effects and the remaining animals were necropsied at Day 29 , 7 days after the last dose, to examine repeat -dose effects . Both studies did not find MDMA -related evidence of CNS neurotoxicity based on routine hematoxylin and eosin staining and expanded neurohistopathology including brain and spinal cord tissue (Luxol fa st blue/cresyl violet, Bielschowsky 's silver stain, MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Spurr resin -embedded toluidine blue) . On this basis, the risk of CNS neurotoxicity with the intended clinical dosing regimen appears to be minimal. Motor Activity MDMA produces some repetitive behavior in rodents, but not to the same degree as psychostimulants. MDMA has been shown to increase locomotor activity [145]. Rats on MDMA walk around a cage perimeter, interpreted as an indicator of thigmotaxis, which is a sign of anxiety [102]. However, it is notable that a 2007 publication failed to find thigmotaxis in rats given 5 mg/kg MDMA HCl [175]. Increased locomotion in rodents after MDMA regulated in part by 5HT 2C and 5HT 2B receptors, possibly through indirectly regulating dopamine and serotonin release [138, 176], and at least one study reported that blocking alpha1 adrenergic receptors reduced locomotor activity after 5 mg/kg [175]. Rhesus monkeys did not exhibit increased after receiving up to 2.4 mg/kg MDMA HCl [177]. Behavioral Effects Several dose -dependent differences on behavioral tests in rats given MDMA have been reported, including increased anxiety -related behaviors thought to be associated with serotonin syndrome [178], and decreased social anxiety at 5 mg/kg i.p. [145]. Rats given 7.5 mg/kg MDMA HCl, equivalent to four times the dose tested in humans, exhibited increased anxiety in the elevated plus maze [179], while rats given 15 mg/kg MDMA HCl, equivalent to eight times the dose tested in humans, exhibited reduced anxiety on the maze. A study in mice reported that doses from 0.5 to 20 mg/kg MDMA HCl produced anxiogenic responses on the plus maze [180]. A study in rats of the effects of four different doses of MDMA HCl given daily for 1 wee k, found reduced anxiety with 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg and increased anxiety with 5 and 10 mg/kg [169]. Lower doses used in these studies are comparable to dose used in human research and nonmedical settings. Howeve r, sample sizes used in the study were small. Rats given higher doses also reduced aggressive behavior as well as social investigation. Mice placed in the forced -swim test, an animal model with high predictive validity for antidepressant action, exhibited less immobility after acute doses of 2.5, 5 , and 10 mg/kg MDMA HCl, considered an indicator of antidepressant activity [180]. Some researchers have proposed that behavioral tests of anxiety may instead be measuring risk - taking behavior, or impulsivity [181]. The possibility of sex-specific effects cannot be ruled out, given the high prevalence of all -male samples [182, 183]. Preclinical data in animals suggests that the profile of neurotransmitter release observed after MDMA administration may increase the risk of mania in some individuals [184], although mania has not been a reported as a side effect of MDMA or Ecstasy in humans. Conflicting findings on anxiogenic and anxiolytic dose -dependent effects of MDMA have been reproduced in clini cal trials. A behavioral study measuring the effect of a single dose of 10 mg/kg MDMA HCl in mice following social defeat detected additive effects on measures of memory, anxiety, and depression, 1 to 10 days after drug administration. Social defeat and MDMA both affected passive avoidance and object recognition memory, and the combination of t he two produced greater memory impairment. Social defeat and MDMA also increased immobility in the tail suspension test, and increased motion and increased tendency to remain in the center of the open field [185]. Administering an additional 5 mg/kg MDMA HCl in the open field resulted in slower speed in mice that underwent social defeat and received MDMA. Social defeat lowere d body temperature, however , when immediately followed by MDMA, body temperature increased and blood cortisol MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 27 of 253 decreased, and the authors refer to this as evidence for stress enhancing impaired cognition and depression -like behavior after MDMA. However, the y did not employ a test of direct effects of corticosterone, and it is possible that social defeat and MDMA could produce independent effects. Morley and colleagues observed rat behavior after receiving 5 mg/kg MDMA HCl, noting that this dose correlated w ith prosocial behavior, such as lying next to each other [145]. Subsequent studies suggest that MDMA increases prosocial behavior in rats by elevating oxytocin in the paraventricular nucleus through 5HT 1A receptor agonism, with the oxytocin increase arising from the indirect effects of MDM A on 5HT 1A receptors via serotonin release [144, 187]. There been no 1A antagonists have negligible effects on subjective or physiological effects of MDMA in humans [84, 188-190]. As a result, it is unclear whether the rat behavior is analogous to human reports of increased feelings of empathy or interpersonal closeness while under the influence of MDMA [17, 191-193]. Pitts and colleagues reported observing greater prosocial effects of MDMA when compared with the psychostimulant methamphetamine in squirrel monkeys [194], confirming rodent findings in primates. The effects were seen with racemic MDMA and with each enantiomer, and they were dampened by administration of a 5HT 2A receptor antagonist. MDMA appears to have prosocial effects on animals less closely related to humans, including octopuses and zebrafish [195, 196]. The study in octop uses examined the octopus serotonin transporter gene, determining that the receptor that binds MDMA is conserved across species. Coordination The effects of MDMA administration on coordination has been tested in primates and rodents. Rhesus monkey coordi nation was tested in a 4 -day repeated dose regimen, receiving a high dose of 10 mg/kg [197]. It was found that MDMA acutely disrupted bimanual motor coordination in rhesus m onkeys following MDMA administration. These effects on bimanual motor coordination were apparent for a week following high dose MDMA administration and returned to baseline at the 1 week mark [197]. The effects of MDMA on fine -motor coordination of baboons has been studied in a single arm, single -dose (0.32 to 7.8 mg/kg, spaced 5 days apart) study [198]. Fine -motor incoordination was not observed in the fine -motor task, but rathe r a dose -dependent delay in initiating the task was observed. It should be noted that 6 months prior to this study, the baboons in question had been used extensively for toxicology studies of both GABA -A allosteric modulators (chronic administration) as we ll as self -administration of cocaine, ethanol , and five distinct sedative compounds [199]. These confounding factors could potentially reduce the validity of the results as it was undocumented whether they resulted in any chronic effects, such as dopaminergic disruption. Coordination was also ascertained in mice in a repeated dosing regimen using a repeated dose regimen twice daily, 3 or 30 mg/kg for 4 days [200]. The effects of MDMA administration on coordination in the mouse was measured using the road test. The mice were tested 24 hours and 48 hours post MDMA administration. Unlike the rhesus monkeys, mice showed no apparent disruption of motor coordination following MDMA administration [200]. Sensorimotor Reflex Responses The effects of 20 mg/kg MDMA HCl on the startle reflex in rats has been tested in a 10-day repeated dosing study [201]. It was observed that MDMA acutely affects the magnitude of the acoustic startle response, while having no long -term effects on the startle response. It was MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 28 of 253 furthermore found that pre -pulse inhibition (unlearned suppression of the startle response) was profoundly reduced in rats exposed to MDMA, both acutely and long -term [201]. In order to evaluate MDMA's effects on bruxism, specifically jaw -clenching, the effects of MDMA on the jaw -opening reflex was tested in rats, both in a single and repeated dose regimen (20 mg/kg MDMA HCl once or same dose, twice daily for 4 days) [202]. It was found that single - dose administrations of MDMA exerted an inhibitory effect on the jaw -opening reflex. For repeated administrations this effect was amplified and found to be mediated by enhanced noradrenergic inhibitory mechanisms tha t are responsible for regulating the jaw -opening reflex [202]. Body Temperature Rodents have generally been used to study the hyperthermic effects of MDMA. Rodents have a much smaller body mass and do not perspire but use their tail to regulate b ody temperature, which has a large surface to volume ratio, and is perfused with many blood vessels for thermoregulation. Since thermoregulation is different in rodents and humans [203], findings may have limited applicability to humans. MDMA doses that are moderate to high elevate body temperature and disrupt thermoregulation in mice [102], and doses of MDMA HCl in the 1 to 2 mg/kg range only cause a slight increase in body temperature [204]. Rats given doses of 10 mg/kg MDMA HCl (s.c. and i.p.), but not 2 mg/kg, experienced increases in body temper ature correlated with levels of the active metabolite MDA [74, 205]. A study of rats r injections of 1 and 3 mg/kg MDMA HCl demonstrated minimal effect on brain hyperthermia using thermal couplers installed in the nucleus accumbens, and in another study, in the striatum [206], however ambient temperatures of 29\u00b0C and social interaction during group housing had a potentiating effect on malignant hyperthermia at 9 mg/kg (s.c.) [207]. MDMA effects on body temperature are susceptible to changes in ambient temperature in rodents, with high ambient temperature significantly increasing body temperature in mice and rats, and low ambient temperatures reducing it [159, 208, 209]. A study in rats found that age -dependent increase in severity of body temperature elevation after 2x5 mg/kg MDMA HCl, with 20 -month old (aged) rats exhibiting significantly higher body temperature than young (40 days old) rats [210]. The aged rats in this study also exhibited more signs of brain and liver toxicity than younger rat s. The MDMA -induced impairment in thermoregulation is caused, at least in part, by peripheral vasoconstriction in the tail, an effect mediated by brain neurotransmitter activity [211, 212]. The exploration of the translation of this finding to elderly humans is ongoing. High doses of MDMA also produce significant elev ations in body temperature in primates [97, 213, 214]. At doses closer to those humans ingest [215], monkeys exhibit only slight to moderate elevation in body temperature [177, 216]. In contrast to findings in rodents, primates, including humans, are not susceptible to changes in ambient temperature when given MDMA, exhibiting slight to moderate increases in body temperature re gardless of the temperature of the environment [177, 215, 216], though at least one study found that the ambient temperature influenced the effects of 1.5 mg/kg i.v. MDMA HCl on body temperature in monkeys, with lower body temperatures seen after MDMA administered in cool temperatures and higher body temperatures in another group given MDMA at warm temperatures [217]. Findings in rodents do not extrapolate well to primates in this area. Given that the thermoregulatory effects in rodents are highly dose-dependent, most physiological effects in humans seen after MDMA administration suggest that a controlled environment and moderate doses are sufficient to mediate physiological complications associated with hyperthermia, including cardiovascular, osmo regulatory, neurological, and immunological effects. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 29 of 253 4.1.3.2 Cardiovascular System The sponsor has completed an appropriately controlled, in vitro IKr Assay (commonly referred to as a human Ether -\u00e0-go-go-Related Gene (hERG) assay) per ICH S7A and S7B. Final results from the cell patch clamp measure found an IC 50 of 206 \u00b5M and a Hill coefficient of 1.1 for MDMA at near-physiologic temperature (33\u00b0C), with a 170 -fold ratio over the expected unbound MDMA plasma concentration in clinical exposure at 2 mg/kg p.o. [218]. These results demonstrate that MDMA has minimal of QTc prolongation or Torsade de Poi ntes (TdP), which is one of the most critical types of arrhythmia associated with sudden death. In comparison, SSRIs are known to carry low to moderate risk of QTc prolongation, including available PTSD medications paroxetine and sertraline [219, 220]. The sponsor has completed an in vivo cardiovascular substudy as a part of the GLP Extended Single -Dose MDMA (with correction factor for HCl once weekly for 4 weeks ( Study 2884 -002). The dog is commonly used to investigate cardiac electrophysiology in a manner that will extrapolate to humans in terms of wh ich cardiac ion channels contribute to cardiac repolarization and to the duration of the action potential. All animals in all groups received an electrocardiographic (ECG) examination pretest, and all survivors predose and 1 -2 hours postdose on Day 1 and p rior to terminal necropsy (study days 2 and 27). Standard ECGs (10 Lead) were recorded at 50 mm/sec. The RR, PR, and QT intervals, and QRS duration were measured and recorded using an appropriate lead. The Principal Investigator for electrocardiographic an alysis interpreted the electrocardiograms. Heart rate was calculated from the number of ECG complexes in 10 seconds. QTc was calculated using Van de Water's correction. There was no effect of the oral administration of MDMA on qualitative or quantitative E CG parameters in this study. In vivo assessments of cardiovascular effects of MDMA in animals detected increased sympathomimetic activity, as seen in humans [102, 153]. An injection of 2 mg/kg MDMA HCl rate in rabbits [152]. Ten mg/kg MDMA HCl produced a relatively larger increase in heart rate in rats than in blood pressure, an effect possibly controlled by beta adrenergic receptors [153]. The researchers found that MDMA has both pressor and depressor effects, acting through adrenergic receptors [221-223]. Another study in rodents also suggests that norepinephrine may play a role in cardiovascular effects [224], findings that have been more intensively investigated in humans [225-228]. Given the affinity of MDMA for the NET, it is possible that the cardiovascular effe cts of MDMA could be partially attributed to norepinephrine signaling in the peripheral nervous system. Injections of 20 mg/kg MDMA HCl in conscious rats assessed by radio telemetry (10.7 times the equivalent dose in humans) found that MDMA caused a prolo nged increase in blood pressure [222]. In the same study, MDMA was found to produce mild isotonic contractions of aorta and vas deferens vascular tissue in anesthetized rats, but could also inhibit prejunctional contractions evoked by stimulation [222]. In vitro work in human internal mammary artery suggests that contractile effects may increase at high temperatures (40 \u00b0C versus 37 \u00b0C) and that some metabolites may contribute to this effect [229]. 4.1.3.3 Respiratory System MDMA causes serotonin reuptake inhibition -mediated release of serotonin which causes indirect agonism of ser otonin receptors and has known sympathomimetic effects. Animal studies show that serotonin agonism increases respiratory drive via actions at 5HT 1A, 5HT 7, and 5HT 4A, although these studies may not translate well to humans [230]. MDMA does not have detectable affinity for the mu opioid receptor. Two published clinical studies with MDMA found MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 30 of 253 there were no significant effects on body temperature measured at tympanic membrane, respiratory rate, or blood oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry [11, 215]. Finally, the definitive GLP 28 -day repeat dosing studies in the rat (2884 -001) and the dog (2884 -002) found no effect MDMA on respiration rate. 4.1.3.4 Hepa tic System MDMA is primarily processed through the hepatic route, with 50 to 75% being metabolized. Standard toxicity studies EMD -SC-001 and EMD -SC-002 failed to find liver damage after MDMA administration in rats or dogs after 28 days of daily exposure [99]. In a sponsor - supported pilot dose range finding study of Sprague -Dawley rats (EMD -AT-001), toxicity was assessed in a 13 -day increasing dose regimen [231] from 25 mg/kg to 300 mg/kg p.o.. This study found significant elevations of the liver toxicity markers alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) in male rats. Despite a rise in these markers, gross pathology and microscopy of liver tissue failed to show any liver d amage [231]. In a sponsor -supported defini tive GLP -Dawley rats ( Study 2884 -001), toxicity was assessed a single -dose arm after 25 mg/kg p.o. MDMA (dose includes HCl correction factor) . A marked increase in AST and ALT with a mild increase in alkaline phosph atase (ALP) and total bilirubin was found in a single animal that was found recumbent with decreased activity and hunched posture on Day 2 and subsequently euthanized, 24 hours post -dose. These were consistent with a hepatobiliary effect and correlated with the microscopic finding of liver necrosis. Moderate increases in triglyceride and cholesterol also indicate a lipid effect. Microscopically, there was extensive acute liver necrosis that was the likely proximate cause of death. Otherwise, t here were no MDMA -related effects on gross findings or organ weights in the single -dose Day 2 or repeat -dose Day 29 animals in pathology or organ weight assessments for the remaining animals. Although direct hepatoxic effects are unlikely, MDMA carries a rare risk of idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity , which is also seen in other marketed medications [232]. 4.1.3.5 Renal System Renal clearance of MDMA is between 8% to 11% of the parent compound. All metabolites of MDMA in urine were detected as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. Acute symptomatic hyponatre mia is associated with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic -hormone secretion (SIADH) AVP [233]. SIADH refers to disorders related to water and sodium balance characterized by the impairment of urinary dilution and hypotonic hyponatremia in the absence of renal disease or other identifiab le non -osmotic stimuli known to activate the release of AVP [234]. MDMA is known to cause central release of both oxytocin and AVP through indirect effects of serotonergic signaling as previously described, and this activity indicates that it is not accurate to attribute the osmoregulatory effects of Ecstasy to SIADH, b ut rather this should be characterized as a pharmacological effect on AVP secretion. AVP plays a key role in osmoregulation and is released upon a change in plasma osmolality [235]. AVP is also involved in the response and adaptation to stress, through its effects on the HPA axis [235]. The rise in AVP does not seem to be part of a generalized stress response, but results from a n indirect pharmacological effect compounded by excessi ve fluid ingestion [236]. AVP is a key regulator of water balance in the body, and has antidiuretic actions when acting at its V2 receptor subtype in the kidneys [237, 238]. In 28 -day repeated dose studies, the only renal change obser ved microscopically was mild to minimal hydronephrosis, which the researchers attributed to treatment -related polyuria (abnormally large urine production). Gross pathology revealed enlarged urinary bladders (most likely polyuria -related) in some animals an d were deemed potentially treatment -related. MDMA can influence water regulation by activation of the AVP system, as shown in several animal studies. A study of isolated in vitro rat hypothalamus MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 31 of 253 initially reported AVP and oxytocin release after vivo drug-discrimination studies in rats suggest that AVP receptors are involved in producing interoceptive effects of MDMA [146]. When 10 mg/kg i.p. MDMA was 30\u00b0C ambient temperature to male Wistar rats, MDMA induced expression of Fos, a marker of neural activation, in the supraoptic nucleus, a brain region important for osmoregulation and a key mediat or of oxytocin and AVP release [239]. This finding suggests that MDMA can affect the renal system in rats at high doses administered at warm ambient temperatures. However, due to <20% renal clear ance of the parent compound, a renal impairment study is not planned. 4.1.4 Pharmacodynamic Drug Interactions MDMA has been shown to interact with numerous CNS active compounds in animals, with effects on behavior, neurotransmitters, gene expression, and therma l regulation among others. When given with moclobemide, a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A, 10 mg/kg i.p. MDMA HCl has been shown to cause statistically significant increases in 5 -HT outflow and body temperature in rats [240]. Caffeine (10 mg/kg) has also been shown to increase MDMA associated hyperthymia in rats when given with 2.5 mg/kg MDMA HCl. Increased hippocampal 5-HT loss was also seen in the caffeine treated animals, which the authors stipulate may result in increased MDMA toxicity [241]. Although previous statements have highlighted deleterious pharmacodynamic drug interactions of MDMA with other CNS active agents, potential for increased efficacy is also possible with concomitant administration with these agents. MDMA efficacy for depression (in a mouse forced swim test) has been shown to be synergistic with non -effective doses of mephedrone, a synthetic amphetamine derivative [180]. Some CNS active agents have been shown to decrease MDMA adverse effects in animals. Both mirtazapine, a direct serotonin antagonist, and fluoxetine, a selective serotonin inhibitor, have shown to reduce MDMA related hyperthermia in rats [242]. Interesting both mechanisms, serotonin blockade and serotonin reuptake inhibition, were shown to have this effect. Other authors have shown that chronic fluoxetine treatment partly attenuates the long -term anxiety and depressive symptoms induced by MDMA in rats [243]. Note that the pharmacodynamic interaction of MDMA with fluoxetine is complicated by also being accompanied by a pharmacokinetic interact ion, as both drugs are substrates and inhibitors of CYP2D6 [244]. Although these effects seem positive, they need be balanced by the possibility of lower efficacy for the primary indication of PTSD when given concurrently. 4.2 Pharmacokinetics and Product Metabolism in Animals For context, it is important to note that MDMA clinical pharmacology differs from many other drugs in psychiatry in that it does not require reaching of steady state for onset of effect like SSRIs, Serotonin and Norepinephrine Uptake Inhibitors ( SNRIs ), and other common drugs. In clinical trials MDMA is given in single -dose sessions consisting of an initial dose followed by a supplemental dose administered 2 hours later, followed by abrupt discontinuation. MDMA's pharmacology is complicated by non -linear ph armacokinetics, which has been observed in multiple mammalian models . Due t o the nonlinear characteristics of MDMA, bioavailability is likely incomplete and variable across doses (see Section 4.2.1 Absorption ). MDMA has been shown to be primary eliminated by hepatic metabolism with minimal renal con tribution in animals (see Section 4.2.3 Metabolism and 4.2.4 Elimination ). MDMA has also been shown to have pharmacokinetic drug interactions with many drugs used in psychiatry, as both the perpe trator and victim compound due to its metabolism though and autoinhibition of CYP2D6 (in humans), a common metabolizing enzyme of CNS agents ( see Section 4.2.5 MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 32 of 253 Pharmacokinetic Drug Interactions ). Additionally, MDMA has been shown in nonclinical studies to have a large volume of distribution and high CNS penetration (see Section 4.2.2 Distribution ). A summary of the pharmacokinetics of MDMA across multiple mammalian s pecies is available in Table 2 . 4.2.1 Absorption At doses of 2 mg/kg, MDMA is rapidly absorbed by rats by both oral and subcutaneous rout es of administration, with an observed T max of 0.56\u00b10.31 hours by the oral route. At higher oral dos es of 10 mg/kg a slightly shorter T max 0.31\u00b10.13 hours was observed in rats [74]. Although no robust IV MDMA data is available to the sponsor at the time of writing this edition of the IB, Baumann and collogues measured IP exposure of MDMA in rats in their 2009 article. At 2 mg/kg the p.o. to i.p . ratio of MDMA AUC can be calculated to be 0.37. This calculated relative bioavailability of 37% can be thought to approximate the absolute bioavailability of MDMA in rats. Note that at doses of 10 mg/kg in rats, the p.o. to i.p. relative bioavailability increases to 65%. At low doses, sex effects on exposure have been observed in rats. This effect dissipated at 5 mg/kg and is not expected nor observed in higher mammals or humans [155]. In squirrel monkeys , Mueller and colleagues observed an oral T max of 1 hour at 1.4 mg/kg and as long as 1.3 hours at 10 mg/kg [245]. At doses of 7.4 mg/kg p.o. to bioavailability can be calculated of 68% [97]. Mechan and colleagues also observed increased exposure repeated dosing, further illustrating MDMA's nonlinear pharmacokinetic char acteristics. A 2011 article from Mueller and colleagues observed a prolonged T max of 7.1 hours at 5 mg/kg in baboons, a result not seen in other non -human primates [246]. Additionally, see Table 2 for a list of exposures across multiple mammalian species. 4.2.2 Distribution MDMA has been shown to be partially bound to plasma proteins in mammals . The mean unbound fraction of MDMA in plasma was measured in rabbits by De Letter and colleges to be 63%\u00b13 (n=6) at a concentration of 400 ng/ml [247]. In vitro plasma -protein binding of MDMA in mice is lower than in rat and human serum, in which it is approximately equa l [248]. This indicates that the same dose of MDMA in mice will have more active drug available in serum than in rats and humans. Mice were shown to have lower plasma protein binding in vitro compared to rats and humans, and only mice exhibited stereoselective plasma protein binding [248]. The volume of distribution of MDMA at 1 mg/kg was observed to be 7.41 to 7.52 L/kg in rats [155]. From Baumann and colleagues' published noncom partmental data, the volume of distribution is 4.43 to 9.52 L/kg in rats. Work from De Letter and colleagues has identified a 2 -compartment model of MDMA pharmacokinetics in rabbits. The total volume of distribution at steady state was reported to be 4.9 L/kg. A central compartment of 1.9 L/kg was elucidated by the model, suggesting a large peripheral compartment in rabbits, leading to a biexponential half -life (alpha -t1/2 of 5 min utes and a beta -t1/2 of 63.5 min utes). The authors also observed some accumu lation of MDMA in the vitreous fluid of rabbits [247]. MDMA has been shown to have high distribution into the CNS compartment. Scheidweiler and colleag ues observed a significantly higher AUC of MDMA in the striatum of mice across doses MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 33 of 253 from 10 mg/kg to 40 mg/kg. Striatum to plasma ratios were observed from 6.5 to 12.4, illustrating MDMA's high CNS penetration [249]. Additionally, MDMA has been shown to distribute into amniotic fluid and the fetal brain in pregnant rats after a single 15 mg/kg SC injection. Although amniotic drug exposure was shown to be lower than in maternal plasma, fetal brain MDMA and MDA exposure was shown to be much higher than that observed in maternal plasma [250]. The volume of distribution of neonatal rats is comparable to adult rats and has been reported to be 4.61 to 4.83 L/kg [251]. 4.2.3 Metabolism MDMA is metabolized via two hepatic pathways in rodents (see Figure 2 for a comparison to human metabolism). In the major pathway in rats, MDMA is O -demethylated b y cytochrome P450 CYP2D1 and 3A2 to form which to generate HMMA by catechol - O-methyltransferase (COMT). In the minor pathway in rats, MDMA is N -demethylated by CYP1A2 and 2D1 to form MDA, which is an active metabolite. MDA is O -demeth ylated by the same enzymes as MDMA, with subsequent metabolism by COMT. Metabolites of MDMA are excreted in urine as sulfate conjugates. MDMA and metabolites have shorter half-lives in rats than humans at comparable doses based on plasma Cmax values. Rats tend to form more MDA and glucuronide -conjugated metabolites than humans [252]. As MDMA 2.5 mg/ kg subcutaneous (s.c.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) in rats, a larger percentage of the administered dose is shunted to the N -demethylation pathway, resulting in greatly enhanced formation of MDA [205]. Comparison of metabolic pathways between rats and mg/kg i.p. MDMA HCl indicate that 49.1% of MDMA is metabolized through the HMMA pathway in mice versus 72% in rats, and 18.3% of MDMA is metabolized through the MDA pathway in mice versus 28% in rats based on AUC ratios to MDMA. MDMA HCl at 10 mg/kg was also found to be elimi nated more rapidly in mice (0.4 hours, i.p.) than rats at (1.1 hours, s.c.) [74, 249]. To address questions of the applicability of interspecies scaling models and nonlinear pharmacology of MDMA, a study examining MDMA and metabolites in rats given 2.5, 5, and , 10 mg/kg s.c. found that MDMA metabolism is nonlinear in rats, with 2.5 mg/kg producing plasma Cmax levels approximating those seen in humans receiving between 75 and 100 mg [18, 205, 253]. Injections of 2 mg/kg s.c. or i.p. in rats were found to be similar to oral administration of 100 mg MDMA HCl in humans based on plasma MDMA and metabolite concentrations [74]. Based on plasma values, a dose of 3 mg/kg i.p. MDMA HCl administered in mice was compara ble to a single oral dose of 100 mg in humans [254]. Studies in rats and mice provide compelling evidence of nonlinear pharmacokin etics, likely due to saturation of metabolic enzymes, determined by greater than expected AUC values for MDMA and MDA after subsequent MDMA doses, while AUCs for HHMA and HMMA remained lower than expected [205, 249]. For example, when comparing the AUCs of the 2 mg/kg s.c. data to the 10 mg/kg s.c. from Bauman [74] and Concheiro [205] respectively, the AUC observed at 10 mg/kg is 1.89x higher than expected from the 2 mg/kg study. This is consistent with nonlinear pharmacokinetics observed in humans (described later in Section 6.2.1 Pharmacokinetics and Product Metabolism in Humans ) and is likely due to autoinhibition of the CYP450 system. MDMA exposure, half -life, and other parameters are summarized below in Table 2 for rats, mice, squirrel monkeys, and humans. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 34 of 253 Table 2: Pharmacokinetic Constants for Plasma MDMA After Various Routes of Administration to Humans or HCl Cmax (ng/ml) AUC metabolism is thought to be the major route of elimination across mammalian species, MDMA and its metabolites have been shown to be present in urine of rats for as long as 48 hours after a si ngle 20 mg/kg MDMA HCl dose [256]. Additionally, De Letter and collogues have shown that at intravenous doses of 1 mg/k g only 6% of the MDMA dose given rabbits was found unchanged in urine [247]. In contrast to most small molecule drugs, MDMA has been shown to have rapid clearance on the first day of life of rats treated with 20 mg/kg of MDMA HCl. Peculiarly, MDMA clearance has been observed to rapidly decrease from 1.26 L/h/kg to 0.81 L/h/kg by day 11 of life in rats [251]. To date, there is no known well controlled animal study quantifying excretion of MDMA into breastmilk. 4.2.5 Pharmacokinetic Drug Interactions MDMA has been shown to effect the absorption, distribution, and metabolism of tramadol in rats, leading to decreased half-life and an increase in exposure at relatively low MDMA HCl doses 0.5 mg/kg [257]. The data from this study suggests that the interaction involved both CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 specificity. MDMA has also been shown to interact with methamphetamine in rats, leading to increased exposure to both MDMA and methamphetamine with concurrent exposure MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 35 of 253 [258]. The authors of the study warn that interactions with other amphetam ine derivatives and CYP2D6 substrates are likely. MDMA is also likely to interact with many approved psychiatric drugs. Upreti and Eddington described the complicated interaction of MDMA with fluoxetine in rats [244, 259]. The authors showed that pretreatment of rats with fluoxetine resulted in an increase in MDMA (1.4 -fold) and MDA (1.5 -fold) exposure in both brain and plasma. Additionally, the elimination half -life wa s increased for MDMA (2.4 vs. 4.9 h) and MDA (1.8 vs. 8.2 h) with fluoxetine pretreatment. As MDMA and fluoxetine are both substrates and inhibitors, and interact with (or metabolized by) the same enzyme, CYP2D6, this profound increase in MDMA exposure was to be expected. The authors also partially ruled out P -glycoprotein as a potential site of drug -drug interactions with MDMA [244]. It is likely that other CYP2D6 substrates or inhibitors used in psychiatry (such as duloxetine, amitriptyline, doxepin, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, or trazadone) may interact with MDMA in small mammals. 4.3 Toxicology MDMA has been studied in single -dose ( see Section 4.3.1 Single -Dose Toxicology Studies ) and repeat -dose toxicology studies (see Section 4.3.2 Repeat -Dose Toxicology Studies ). The spon sor has also completed in vitro and in vivo safety studies addressing genotoxicity (see Section 4.3.3 Genotoxicity ), fertility and early embryonic development (see Section 4.3.5 Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity ), and embryo -fetal development with toxicokinetic analyses. Independent nonclinical studies support that MDMA possesses abuse potential, but much less than structurally related compounds, such as amphetamine ( see Section 4.3.6.3 Abuse Potential ). Overall, sponsor conducted studies have shown MDMA was well tolerated with no mortality or significant toxicologic findings after p.o. administration to rats (<150 mg/kg) and (<9 mg/kg) when single -housed . Completed sponsor -initiated toxicology studies are summarized in Table 1 . 4.3.1 Single -Dose Toxicology Studies In a sponsor -supported single -dose study of Sprague -Dawley rats (EMD -AT-001), 10 rats per sex were exposed to 300 mg/kg p.o.. Of these, 40% per sex died, and 12 survivors were euthanized 3 days later [231]. The single -dose oral LD 50 was estim ated at 322 mg/kg, which is 6x higher than the LD 50 for i.p. injection. These findings show that MDMA administered orally at 300 mg/kg (approximately 100 to 150x the accepted human therapeutic dose), resulted in marked adverse clinical reactions, including death; with physiological and morphological changes in the kidney (hydronephosis), and possible testicular tubular changes. No evidence of histologic brain damage was found in the survivors using Cresyl violet, Luxol fast blue, and Bodian's silver stain i n standard histopathology assessments. Single doses between 5 and 100 mg/kg have been administered in rodents. Single doses in this range have transient effects on serotonin depletion [74, 205, 255], likely due to reversible tryptophan hy droxylase [260-262], which prevents additional serotonin from being produced and released. A study of the long -term effects of a single dose of 5.7 mg/kg MDMA HCl on estimated SERT sites in the brains of squirrel monkeys reported reduced SERT sites in some frontal, temporal and parietal areas [263]. The plasma Cmax of 725 \u00b5g/L in squirrel monkeys was 3x greater than what is observed in humans after a single dose of 100 mg MDMA HCl [252, 264, 265]. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 36 of 253 4.3.2 Repeat -Dose Toxicology Stu dies In order to establish the Clinical Development Program for MDMA, 28 -day repeat -dose general toxicity studies were conducted in both sexes of Sprague -Dawley rats (53 male, 52 female) (0, 10, 50, 100 mg/kg MDMA HCl oral gavage) and dog s (12 male, 12 female) (0, 3, 9, 15 mg/kg /day MDMA HCl oral dosing with gelatin capsules) [99]. The initial highest dose was set at 18 mg/kg /day but after the death of one female dog, the highest dose was subsequently reduced to 15 mg/kg /day. Dosing was once daily for 28 days. This research was performed within the U.S., which i s a member of the Mutual Acceptance of Data (MAD) program, and studies were conducted in compliance with GLP based on available standards in 1986. Both sexes of dogs administered 9 and 15 mg/kg /day of MDMA HCl and rats receiving 50 and 100 mg/kg /day gained less weight than controls and the 3 mg/kg /day group, with significant differences in food consumption observed as early as the first week which were no longer significantly different by the third week for the rats and the fourth week for the dogs. Gross o bservations at necropsy in the dog possibly related to MDMA included reduced testicular size for one of three dogs receiving 9 mg/kg /day and one of three dogs receiving 15 mg/kg /day and prostatic enlargement in two dogs receiving 15 mg/kg /day. No gross les ions were seen in the rats at necropsy. Blood chemistry and urinalysis values were unremarkable in the dog. Clinical pathology findings showing a trend to decrease with dose in the rat were urinary pH, blood urea nitrogen, glucose, creatinine (females), lactate dehydrogenase (females), and chloride, in contrast total white blood cell count (WBC) and phosphorus showed a trend to increase with dose. Histopathological examinations showed mild, diffuse atrophy in the two dogs with reduced testicular size. Mild, focal atrophy was furthermore observed in the testes of one additional dog from the 15 mg/kg /day group. The two dogs with grossly enlarged prostates showed hyperplasia of the prostate. The silver stain for neurohistopathology was inconclusive in both the rat and the dog studies. These were interpreted as potentially MDMA -related effects as they were only seen in MDMA dosed animals and not in vehicle treated animals. In the rat, effects were observed in 5 of 10 male rats adminis tered 100 mg/kg /day (none were observed in females). Although inconclusive, these potential effects were interpreted as vacuolated lesions apparent in the fiber tracts of the brainstem adjacent to the trigeminal nuclei. In the cerebrum of the dog, these effects included floccular changes of white matter, focal neural malacia and focal cellular infiltrates. Neural chromatolysis was observed in the brainstem. However, the authors noted that it is difficult to extrapolate the findings due to the low sample siz e (three dogs per sex per group). In a MAPS -sponsored pilot dose range finding study of Sprague -Dawley rats (EMD -AT-001), oral toxicity was assessed in a 13 -day increasing dose regimen [231]. The initial dose started at 25 mg/kg and was increased by 25 mg/kg on a daily basis until 300 mg/kg was reached. Adverse reactions were observed in all doses above 25 mg/kg and included hyperexcitability, uncontrolled urination, piloerection and bulging eyes. Tremors, muscle spasms, impaired movement, convulsions , and death were observed in the highest of do se levels, in the range of 150 and 300 mg/kg. Blood chemistry analyses suggested possible liver and kidney damage in animals receiving higher doses, however, gross pathology and microscopy found no treatment -related damage to the liver. The only renal chan ge observed via microscope was mild to minimal hydronephrosis, which the researchers attributed to treatment -related polyuria (abnormally large urine production). Minimal tubular atrophy was seen in the testes of 3 of the 20 treated male rats, suggesting a possible relationship between high dose, repeated MDMA treatment and minimal testicular atrophy in the male rat. Gross pathology revealed reddened lungs and enlarged urinary bladders (most likely polyuria -related) in some animals and were deemed potential ly treatment - related. Histopathological observations of brain tissue revealed no signs of brain damage in any of the treated rats. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 37 of 253 These studies were supplemented with MAPS -sponsored definitive GLP follow -up Extended Single -Dose Neurotoxicology studies in the rat (Study 2884 -001) and the dog (Study 2884 -002) to conclusively study neurotoxicity with modern experimental methods at doses covering the MTD (see Table 5 Summary of Ongoing and Planned Sponsor Supported Trials with MDMA ). An interim necropsy was performed on selected animals at Day 2 to examine single -dose effects and the remaining animals were necropsied at Day 29, 7 days after the last of four weekly doses, to examine repeat -dose effects. Both studies did not find MDMA -related evidence of CNS neurotoxicity based on routine hematoxylin and eosin staining and expanded neurohistopathology including brain and spinal cord tissue . In Study 2884 -001, 28-day repeat -dose general toxicity studies were conducted in both sexes of Sprague -Dawley rats ( 10 male, 10 female per dose per arm ) (0, 2, 7.5, 25/20 mg/kg MDMA of 25mg/kg/ dose of MDMA HCl was not tolerated in male rats, resulting in mortality of 6 of 20 study males. Clinical signs preceding eu thanasia (n=1) included decreased activity, hunched posture, partially closed eyes and lateral recumbency. Clinical signs associated with oral administration of MDMA HCl (observed at 7.5mg/kg/dose and above, depending on the sign) varied by sex and include d salivation , increased activity, red material around the nose, hypersensitivity to touch, hypersensitivity to sound , piloerection , stereotypy (head weaving), and aggression. Changes in FOB endpoints were consistent with the clinical signs and included cha nges in endpoints , most apparent 1 hour post dose and trending towards resolution at 24 hours post dose. Weekly oral MDMA administration resulted in decreases in mean body weight gain in animals administered 25/20 mg/kg/dose between Days -1 and 14 for males and Days -1 and 7 for females. This correlated with decreases in mean food consumption in males administered 25/20 mg/kg/dose between Days 7 and 14. Changes in clinical pathology associated with MDMA administration included minimal decreases in mean urine volume and/or elevated urine specific gravity and increased total protein, albumin and globulins which was indicative of minimal subclinical dehydration in both sexes at 25/20 mg/kg/dose. Microscopically, MDMA changes were noted in the quadriceps, soleus and gastrocnemius skeletal muscles on Days 2 and 29. These findings included myofiber degeneration in the quadriceps (males 7.5 mg/kg/dose and females 2 mg/kg), soleus (25/20 mg/kg/dose males > females) and rarely in the gastrocnemius (25/20 mg/kg/dose males only) with infiltrations of mononuclear cells/leukocytes and/or neutrophils to varying degrees depending on muscle type (quadriceps>soleus> gastrocnemius). The basis for the difference was s uspected to be related to a difference in myofiber type in the soleus muscles of rats. At terminal necropsy w ithin 7 days after the last of four weekly repeated dose s, myofiber degeneration was observed at a much lower incidence in the soleus muscles and r arely present in the gastrocnemius muscle (males only) . It is possible that these observations indicate some level of repair or adaption , as a low incidence of myofiber regeneration was also found at the MTD . Exposure of MDMA and active metabolite MDA as m easured by C max and AUC (0-10hr) generally increased in a dose proportional to greater than dose proportional manner across the dose range with no notable differences in exposure related to sex and no evidence of accumulation or reduction in exposure after repeat administration. Taken together, weekly MDMA administration for 28 days (4 total doses) via oral gavage was tolerated in Sprague -Dawley rats up to 25 mg/kg/dose in females and 20 mg/kg/dose in males. Due to the lack of any adverse findings or mortali ty after reducing the dose level in males, the NOAEL is determined to be 25 mg/kg/dose in females and 20 mg/kg/dose in males which correlated with Day 22 systemic exposures of 1490 ng/mL and 10700 hr*ng/mL (C max and AUC females and 1100 ng/mL an d 4590 hr*ng/mL (C max and AUC 0-10hr) in males. The risk of CNS neurotoxicity is minimal, however microscopic findings in the rat include a risk of neuromuscular inflammation in skeletal muscle in the periphery at human equivalent do ses. An in vitro study reported MDMA activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors transients and increasing acidification in MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 38 of 253 myofibers , potentially leading to generalized de nervation which precedes myof iber degeneration [266]. In Study 2884 -002, 28 -day repeat -dose general toxicity studies were conducted in both sexes of beagle dogs (3 male, 3 female per dose per arm) (0, 2, 4, 12/9 mg/kg MDMA HCl by oral gavage). Oral administration of 12mg/kg/dose of MDMA HCl was not tolerated resulting in mortality of 4 dogs and one dog at 9 mg/kg/dose. Clinical signs preceding euthanasia included severe hypersensitivity to sound and touch , salivation, vocalization, aggression and (in the single animal administered 9 mg/kg/do se) unconsciousness. Clinical signs associated with oral MDMA were most prominent on Day 1 (generally resolving within 24 hours of dosing), diminished at subsequent dosing intervals and included increased salivation, injected sclera, hypersensitivity to touch and vomitus/emesis/retching at 2 mg/kg/week; lacrimation/ocular discharge (yellow or green; which was observed in a single 12 mg/kg animal during ophthalmoscopic exams on Day 2), and increased activity at 4 mg/kg/week; and dilated pupils, aggressiv e behavior, hypersensitivity to sound, vocalization, trembling, partially/completely closed eyelids, stereotypy/abnormal head movements (jerking and side to side), audible breathing, coughing and cold skin at 12/9 mg/kg/week. Changes in the FOBs were consi stent with the clinical signs and included changes in endpoints related to activity/arousal, sensorimotor, neuromuscular and autonomic endpoints that are consistent with clinical observations described above. Changes were generally similar between the sexe s and were most apparent at 1 hour post dose on Day 1 with a majority of changes trending towards resolution by 24 hours post dose. A majority of the changes in FOB endpoints observed on Day 1 were also observed on Day 22. Oral MDMA administration resulte d in a reduction in mean body weight during Week 1 and an overall decrease in mean body weight gain through the dosing phase in males administered 12/9 mg/kg/week. Post dose decreases in food consumption were observed at all dose levels (including controls ) predominantly during Week 1, however, this decrease in food consumption did not translate into a body weight effect in any dose level except 12/9 mg/kg males. Following weekly oral gavage administration of MDMA, exposure (mean C max and AUC 0- 8hr) of MDM A and MDA increased with increasing dose in an approximately dose proportional manner from 2 to 9 mg/kg, with no apparent increase from 9 to 12 mg/kg (N=1) on Day 1 and increased with increasing dose in an approximately dose proportional manner from 2 to 9 mg/kg on Day 22 with no evidence of accumulation or differences in sex. Systemic exposure (AUC 0- 8hr) to MDA appeared similar to the systemic exposure of MDMA on Days 1 and 22. Taken together, weekly oral administration of MDMA for 4 weeks (4 total doses ) was tolerated in dogs up to 4 mg/kg/week. Due to the mortality/early termination at 12 and 9 mg/kg/week, the NOAEL for this study is determined to be 4 mg/kg/week which correlated with peak and cumulative exposures of 219 ng/mL and 139 ng/mL (C max) and 9 Genotoxicity A sponsor funded in vitro bacterial reverse mutation Ames assay was conducted for MDMA by Charles River Labs. This GLP compliant study was completed April 2020. Four tester strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA1537, TA98, one (WP2 uvr A) were used for mutagenicity testing. After a range finding assay, MDMA HCl was tested at 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2500, and 5000 \u00b5g/plate using the plate incorporation method. Precipitates and cytotoxicity were not observed in any strain with or without meta bolic activation. Additionally, criteria for a negative response (via Ames assay) were met for all tested strains with and without metabolic activation. These data support the conclusion that MDMA is negative for mutagenic activity in Salmonella typhimuriu m and Escherichia coli. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 39 of 253 A sponsor funded in vitro genotoxicity chromosome aberration test in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells was conducted for MDMA by Charles River Labs. This GLP compliant study was completed April 2020. Chinese hamster ovary cells cu ltures were treated with MDMA, positive control, or vehicle control in the presence and absence of an Aroclor 1254 -induced rat liver S9 microsomal fraction (for metabolic activation). After a range finding assay, MDMA was tested at range of 60 to 240 \u00b5g/m L. No statistically significant test article -related increases were observed in the mean percent of cells with aberrations. Additionally, no statistically significant increases in polyploidy or endoreduplication were observed. MDMA was considered negative for inducing structural aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells with and without metabolic activation under the conditions of this test system. These data support the conclusion that MDMA is negative for genotoxic activity in CHO cells in the presence a nd absence of metabolic activation. A sponsor funded GLP -compliant in vivo genotoxicity study was conducted for MDMA in male Sprague Dawley rats in April 2020. The vehicle control (Nanopure Diamond ultrapure water) or the maximum tolerated d ose of 100 mg/kg MDMA HCl were administered orally via gavage once daily for 2 consecutive days. Bone marrow was harvested approximately 24 hours after the last dose was administered for the vehicle and test article groups. The positive control (cyclophosp hamide; stock slides prepared in WIL -99737) was administered orally via gavage and harvested approximately 24 hours after dose was administered. MDMA did not produce statistically significant or dose -dependent increases in the %MN -PCEs in male rats at any dose level as compared to the vehicle control. No bone marrow cytotoxicity (decreases in PCE:TE ratio) was noted in any male rats at any 3,4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine hydrochloride dose level. Group mean values for %MN -PCEs and PCE:TE ratios for the ve hicle and positive controls were within 95% historical control intervals obtained by Charles River Skokie, demonstrating the acceptability of the assay with the following exception. The %MN - PCEs for the positive control male rats (2.91) produced a higher r esponse when compared to the 95% historical control interval (0.13 to 2.59). This demonstrated a more robust positive response. Therefore, MDMA was negative for clastogenic activity and/or disruption of the mitotic apparatus under the conditions of this as say. 4.3.4 Carcinogenicity Based on negative genotoxicity studies, there is no cause for concern of carcinogenic risk of MDMA and carcinogenicity studies have been waived by regulatory agencies. No tumors were reported after daily 28 -day repeated dose toxicolo gy studies of MDMA in rats or dogs described in Section 4.3.3 Genotoxicity . 4.3.5 Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity Preliminary teratological studies in rats (N=12 per dose) given 0, 2.5, or 10 mg/kg MDMA HCl by gavage on alternate gestational days (GD) 6 to 18 found no abnormalities in gestational duration, litter size, neonatal birth weights, or birth defects (N=10 litters per dose), despite statistically significant reduction in maternal weight gain at 10 mg/kg [267]. These results are in contrast to physiological abnormalities resulting from prenatal methamphetamine and d - amphetamine exposure in mice and rabbits [268]. The sponsor has completed a definitive GLP study of the effects of MDMA on Fertility and Early Embryonic Development to Implantation in both sexes of rats. In this study, males were dosed once daily for 28 days prior to pairing and continued to euthanasia. Females were dosed 21 days prior to pairing and continued through GD 7. The copulatory interval (days to mating) in the MDMA -treated groups ran ged from 3.5 to 3.9 days. Euthanasia was conducted at GD13. MDMA -related clinical observations included hypersensitivity to MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 40 of 253 red material , and red discolored wet hair around the nose and/or mouth and were not considered adverse. MDMA -related decreases in body weight, body weight gain, and food consumption were expected pharmacological effects based on repeat -dose studies described in Section 4.3.2 Repeat - Dose Toxicology Studies . Mean prostate gland weights decreased in all MDMA -treated groups relative to controls, however this did not affect fertility or overall health of the animals. The NOA EL dose was demonstrated to be the highest dose level evaluated 10 mg/kg/day (supratherapeutic dose) in both sexes for fertility and reproductive performance. The sponsor has completed a pilot prenatal developmental toxicokinetic study in time -mated female rats in order to optimize dose selection for definitive GLP reproductive toxicology studies (see Table 1: Summary of Completed and Planned Nonclinical Toxicology Studies ). Rats were dosed on gestations days (GD) 6 through 17. Fiv e dose levels were tested 0 mg/kg/day (vehicle control), 2.5 mg/kg/day, 5 mg/kg/day, observations of salivation, as well as decreases in mean gestation body weight, body wei ght change, food consumption, adjusted GD 21 body weight, and adjusted GD 6 to 21 body weight change were observed at all dose levels. MDMA -related decreases in mean gestation body weight and body weight change in comparison to controls were observed at al l dose levels evaluated. At 15 mg/kg/day, mean body weight was statistically lower than controls on GD 9 ( -8.8%) and 12 ( -8.4%). At 20 mg/kg/day, mean body weight was statistically lower than controls on GD 9 ( -10.6%) and 12 ( -8.9%). MDMA was tolerated at dose levels 20 mg/kg/day when administered to time -mated female rats once daily via oral gavage from GD 6 to 17. No effects of MDMA at these dose levels were noted on mortality, clinical observations, or maternal macroscopic observations. Likewise, no MD MA-related effects were noted at dose levels 20 mg/kg/day on ovarian and uterine implantation data (mean number of corpora lutea, implantation sites, viable fetuses, resorption sites [early, late, and total], litter size, and mean pre - and post -implantati on loss indices), mean gravid (pregnancy) uterine weights, or fetal body weights. No external malformations or developmental variations were noted in any of the fetuses evaluated on GD 21. As expected from prior literature, the AUC/Dose ratio increases with higher doses, indicative of non -linear pharmacokinetics. Systemic exposure (AUC 0-12hr) to MDMA did not appear to change following repeated administration of MDMA, indicating lack of systemic accumulation in rats despite daily dosing. Pilot dose range fin ding developmental toxicity studies found no adverse developmental effects in rats at 20 mg/kg/day by gavage. The sponsor completed a pilot prenatal developmental toxicokinetic study in time -mated female New Zealand White Hra:(NZW)SPF rabbits in order to optimize dose selection for definitive GLP reproductive toxicology studies (see Table 1: Summary of Completed and Planned Nonclinical Toxicology Studies ). Rabbits were dosed on GD 7-19 at 0 mg/kg/day (vehicle control), mg/kg/day and 20 mg/kg/day (N=6 each) . MDMA - related mortality was observed at 15 and 20 mg/kg/day. Two females died on GD 7 following a single dose of MDMA at 20 mg/kg. Due to excessive toxicity at 15 mg/kg/day the dose level was lowered to 10 mg/kg/day beginning on GD 9 and the remainder of the 20 mg/kg group was euthanized. MDMA was tolerated at dose levels 10 mg/kg/day when administered to time -mated female rabbits once daily via oral gavage from GD 7 to 19. No effects of MDMA at these dose levels were noted on mortality, mean gestation body weight, or maternal macroscopic observations. No external malformations or developmental variations were noted in any of the fetuses evaluated on GD 29. As expected from prior literature, t he AUC/Dose ratio increases with higher doses, indicative of non -linear pharmacokinetics and possible systemic accumulation in pregnant rabbits. Pilot dose range finding developmental toxicity studies found no adverse developmental effects in rabbits at 10 mg/kg/day by gavage. The sponsor has also completed a definitive GLP embryo/fetal developmental toxicology study in time-mated female New Zealand White Hra:(NZW)SPF rabbits. Rabbits were dosed on GD7 -19 MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 41 of 253 at 0 mg/kg/day (vehicle control), 2.5 mg/kg/day, 5 mg/kg/day, and 10 mg/kg/day (N=22 each). MDMA was -tolerated at dose levels 10 mg/kg/day. No MDMA -related effects were noted on maternal survival, mean gestation body weight, ovarian and uterine implantation data (mean number of corpora lutea, implant ation sites, viable fetuses, resorption sites [early, late, and total], litter size, and mean pre - and post -implantation loss indices), mean gravid uterine weights, adjusted GD 29 body weight, or maternal macroscopic observations at any of the dose levels evaluated. Likewise, no effect of MDMA was noted on fetal sex ratio, fetal body weights, or fetal external, visceral, or skeletal examinations. No adverse MDMA -related effects were noted on clinical observations, body weight change, food consumption, and a djusted GD 0 -29 body weight change at any of the dose levels evaluated. MDMA -related clinical observations of dilated pupils and ears cold to touch were noted in all treated groups. Additional findings noted at 5 and 10 mg/kg/day included hypersensitivity to touch and rapid breathing. At 5 and 10 mg/kg/day, mean gestation body weight gain was decreased in comparison to controls (statistically significant at 10 mg/kg/day). Adjusted GD 0 -29 body weight gain at 5 and 10 mg/kg/day were lower than controls. Mean food consumption at 10 mg/kg/day was also statistically lower than controls. These findings were all expected pharmacological effects of MDMA and were therefore not considered adverse. Following daily oral gavage administration of MDMA to pregnant rabbi ts, AUC 0-24hr values for MDMA increased with increasing dose in a slightly greater than dose proportional manner on GD 7 and increased in an approximately dose proportional manner from 2.5 to 5 mg/kg and in a greater than dose proportional manner from 2.5 to 10 mg/kg GD 19. Systemic exposure (AUC 0-24hr values) to MDMA increased following repeated administration of 5 and 10 mg/kg MDMA HCl to pregnant rabbits. Following daily oral gavage administration of MDMA to pregnant rabbits, C max and AUC 0-24hr values fo r MDA increased with increasing dose in a greater than dose proportional manner on GD 7 and GD 19. Systemic exposure (AUC 0-24hr values) to MDA increased following repeated administration of 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg MDMA HCl to pregnant rabbits. Systemic exposu re (AUC 0-24hr values) to MDA was 1 to 3 times greater than the systemic exposure to MDMA on GD 7 and GD 19. Based on the results of this study, the NOAEL for maternal and developmental toxicity was considered to be 10 mg/kg/day, the highest dose level eval uated, with a maternal MDMA C max of Studies 4.3.6.1 Immunological Effects MDMA may act as a mild immunosuppressant in rodents, with no evidence of immunotoxicity in repeat -dose toxicology studies described in Section 4.3.2 Repeat -Dose Toxicology Studies . Only a trend towards a dose -dependent increase in white blood cells were noted in the dog study, which could be related to an increase in cortisol secretion induced by MDMA. S ingle -dose MDMA administration at 5 mg/kg in rats is associated with impaired macrophage activity as evidenced by inhibition of tumor necrosis factor -alpha (TNF - ) secretion for 12 hours post mice in jected with 10 mg/kg MDMA HCl for 5 days, increases in in epithelial tissue of cytokines interleukin 1 -alpha (IL -1 ), granulocyte -colony stimulating factor (G -CSF), and interleukin 3 (IL -3) were found, while decreased serum levels of many cytokines were re ported [270]. MDMA decreased neutro phil oxidative and phagocytosis and increased the number of circulating neutrophils while decreasing the number of lymphocytes. Incubating photoreceptor - generated cells with 0.5, 1 and 2 \u00b5M MDMA HCl activated macrophages and leading them o through a noradrenergic pathway in the hypothalamus [272]. MD MA also suppresses interferon - secretion and signaling in mice [273]. Interestingly, MDMA was shown to reduce inflammation and airway reactivity in a mouse model of allergic asthma, suggesting that 10 mg/kg MDMA HCl (i.p.) could have beneficial immunomodulatory effects in ca ses of MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 42 of 253 heightened inflammation [274]. A microa rray study found that mice self -administering MDMA at moderate doses had transcriptional changes in many genes related to immune and inflammatory responses as well as neuroplasticity and learning [275], suggesting that immunosuppressant effects of MDMA at clinically relevant doses could be beneficial in the treatment of psychoneuroimmunological disorders such as PTSD [276]. There have been no publications reporting an increased occurrence of tumors or infections associated with MDMA adminis tration to date, so these cell -mediated effects are unlikely to relate to immunotoxicity. 4.3.6.2 Mechanistic Studies Epigenetic modifications, including deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation, demethylation, and histone acetylation, are thought to be involved i n dynamic regulation of memory reconsolidation in the adult nervous system and play a role in memory formation [277]. Early childhood adversity and trauma is associated with transcriptional silencing of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) gene through DNA methylation, which can either be a risk factor in development of PTSD or a res ult of having PTSD in adulthood [278]. Epigenetic effects on BDNF and other gene expression is one possible hypothesized mechanism by which MDMA in combination with training in animal studies modeling anxiety disorders, or therapy in humans, exerts its therapeutic effects. The social effects of MDMA may also include setting -dependent acute social sensitization and extension of a critical period of increased sociality in mice. MDMA may sensitize mice to social interactions with unfamiliar mice via setting -dependent sensitization [279]. After an initial dose of MDMA HCl (7.8 mg/kg) in the company of an unfamiliar mouse, a sub sequent dose produced greater social interaction. The same effect did not occur when preceded by a social setting, or with MDMA in a nonsocial setting, and the effect can be antagonized by blocking 5HT 2A receptors. Adult mice exhibited a greater desire to be with another mouse 2 days after receiving MDMA HCl (10 mg/kg) [280], re-opening a critical period for learning social reward that generally declines during adulthood. This effect appears tied to upregulation of oxytocin receptors in the nucleus accumbens. These effects may support posited therapeutic effects in humans, such as increased rapport with therapists and greater ability to have fulfilling interpersonal relationships. A series of studies examining neuritogenesis, a marker of neuroplasticity, found that MDMA and classic psychedelics stimulated neurite growth with -dependent effect blocked by 5HT 2A antagonists. MDMA was more effective than ketamine in promoting neurite growth. These findings may lie behind some of the therapeutic effects of MDMA, such as enhanced fear extinction learning, greater sensitization t o prosocial effects and or re -learning or re -opening experiencing social reward, but behavioral effects were not specifically tested in this report. MDMA given before training persistently enhanced fear extinction learning in mice through a BDNF -dependen t mechanism [282], which could be a possible mechanism of action for MDMA in combination with therapy as a treatment f or anxiety disorders. The dose of 5.6 mg/kg was approximately two times a human equivalent dose based on exposure, but these findings were the first biological evidence of a lasting effect of MDMA administered in combination with training on lasting attenu ation of anxiety -related behavior in mice. MDMA HCl (1 mg/kg, 2 .5 and 5 mg/kg, not 1 or 10 mg/kg) , given alone or with nicotine, enhanced consolidation of recall for a passive -avoidance task, a different type of fear memory [180, 283]. A fear extinction study in rats funded by MAPS failed to replicate an enhancement of fear extinction, finding instead that 3 and 5 mg/kg MDMA HCl administered prior to training impaired fear extinction learning, while MDMA administered during reconsolidation produced persistent reduction in fear [284]. These MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 43 of 253 results highlight species -specific differences between rats and mice among translational mechanistic studies attempting to simulate results observed in clinical trials. A number of research teams have studied the effects of MDMA on gene expression in roden ts [285-290]. Many of these reports used 10 to 20 mg/kg MDMA HCl. Toxicity was not observed at these doses, and effects were broadly indicative of changes in memory and cognition. Particularly of interest for treatment of PTSD, one study found downregulation of the gene for several glutamate recepto r genes, several calcium transport genes, and the cannabinoid receptor CB1, among other effects [286]. Another study found that MDMA influenced genes of proteins known to regulate glutamatergic signaling and are associated with neuro plasticity and learning, as well as processes involved in memory consolidation in serotonergic neurons [275]. These studies also report an increase in expression of genes that regulate the GABA transporter [285], which is expressed in GABAergic regulated by glutamatergic afferent neurons. Serotonin -transporter knockout mice did not display some of these changes in gene transcription, suggesting that serotonin release is required for this activity [285]. In the acute period 24 to 48 hours after MDMA exposure, a study in rats found 33 to 70% upregulation of BDNF messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) transcripts in the frontal cortex, with a time -dependent decrease, up to 73%, of BDNF transcripts in the hippocampus [291]. The frontal cortex and hippocampus are both regions known to play a causal role in memory retrieval and reconsolidation in animals and humans [292], mediated in part through GABAergic signaling [293]. Changes in transcription do not always correlate with functional consequences in proteins levels. BDNF has been shown to have multiple functionally distinct splice variants which have tight temporal and spatial control in an activity -depe ndent, stimulus -specific manner [294]. However, MDMA produces a durable enhancement of fear extinction in mice, an effect mediated by an MDMA -associated increase in BDNF expression specifically in the context of fear extinction trainin g, supporting that gene expression changes after MDMA are functionally relevant [282]. Examining rat brains after rep eated MDMA administration for 2 weeks detected a sharp drop in SERT expression [295], suggesting a compensatory downregula tion in response to repeated high doses of MDMA. A study in rats found repeated administration of MDMA HCl at 1 or 5 mg/kg weekly for 4 weeks increased transcripts for 5HT 1B receptors in various brain regions and 5HT 2C receptors in the cortex and hypothala mus, likely due to serotonin depletion and subsequent need to increase serotonin receptor availability [296]. Increased levels of gene transcripts regulating extracellular signaling in mice were also reported after MDMA [297]. Serotonin may play a more significant role than dopamine in transcription changes mediated by MDMA [296]. Mouse brains examined 8 hours after 8 days of self -administration or non -contingent administration detected increased transcription of genes related to inflammation and immune modulation in both groups and transcription of genes related to neuroadaptation in mice self -administering MDMA [275]. Transcripts in these studies were assessed 8 to 10 hours after the last of repeated MDMA administrations and it is unclear whether these changes reflect residual acute effects of the MDMA, or changes related to repeated MDMA administration. Findings in rats were confirmed in humans receiving a dose of 75 mg MDMA HCl in the therapeutic dose range, which found increased expression of the SER T gene following MDMA when compared with placebo [298]. Increased SERT gene expression after MDMA was associated with decreased arousal and increased fatigue. Taken together, these nonclinical studies support a plausible mechanism for the therapeutic actions of MDMA administered in a single -dose regimen. 4.3.6.3 Abuse Potential Nonclinical studies support that MDMA possesses some abuse potential, though to a much lesser degree than amphetamine. A number of studies have investigated the abuse liability of MDMA in animals through paradigms of drug seeking, drug discrimination, and withdrawal. Mice, rats, and MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 44 of 253 monkeys self -administer MDMA, indicating that MDM A has rewarding properties in animals [299-302]; however, the rate and response -acquisition of self -administration is much lower than other drugs of abuse, such as cocaine or heroin. Rodent studies found that training attempts at self-administration required an increased training dose of 1.75 mg/kg for acquisition over a 5 week period [301, 303-305]. Research that used the ability of a drug to impact the rate of intracranial self -stimulation (ICSS) as a measure of abuse liability compar ed the impact of 0.32, 1, or 3.2 mg/kg MDMA HCl pretreatment in male and female rats . At the 3.2 mg/kg dose, MDMA increased responding for ICSS when the rate of responding for ICSS was low, and reduced seeking ICSS when rate of responding was very high in both sexes [122]. Physical dependence and drug withdrawal were investigated by treating rats with 10 mg/kg i.p. MDMA HCl twice daily for 5 days. When compared with rats trained to self -administer cocaine , MDMA -trained rats were less likely to return to self -administration after a period of abstinence [300]. Results in a study in mice showed that they did not exhibit aversive/dysphoric or anxiogenic behaviors after treatment, indicating that high doses of MDMA do not induce classical symptoms of physical dependence [306]. Monkeys choose to self -administer MDMA in doses equivalent to or only s lightly higher than doses used by humans [299], but typically reduce their MDMA intake over time. While monkeys work hard to obtain MDMA, they work harder to obtain other psychostimulants, such as cocaine or methamphetamine [304, 305]. Taken together, results in animals suggest that the abuse liability of MDMA is low to moderate. Nonclinical drug discrimination studies investigating the discriminative stimulus effects of MDMA as either hallucinogenic or stimulant have reported inconsistent findings, indicating that psychoactive effects of MDMA are not expressly hallucinogenic or stimulating [307]. Two -way discrimination studies with MDMA are not specific enough to assess the complex pharmacological profile of MDMA and lead to low accuracy and mixed results. In three -way discrimination studies, MDMA has discriminative stimulus effects that are more serotonergic, with minimal involvement of dopamine. One such study found that lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) produced dose -dependent increased substitution for while neither cocaine nor 2,5 - dimethoxy -4-bromoamphetamine (DOB) substituted for it [308]. Administering MDMA to amphetamine -trained rats suggests that dopamine plays a role in stimulus properties, but blocking serotonin receptors interfered with recognizing MDMA, while administering do pamine receptor antagonists did not do so [309]. A higher dose of 3 mg/kg may have a greater dopaminergic component, while 1.5 mg/kg may have more of a sero tonergic component [134] in drug discrimination studies in rats. Serotonin 5HT 1A-acting drugs were treated similarly to both 1.5 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg MDMA HCl [134]. Drug discrimination studies in SERT knockout ra ts supports a key role for serotonin release in producing the subjective effects of 1.5 mg/kg MDMA HCl [147]. The ratio of serotonin to dopamine release are likely to influence stimulus characteristics of MDMA in animal models, and these studies lead to the definition of a unique class of drugs called the Entactogens, which are clearly distinguishable from hall ucinogens and stimulants. Discrimination research in a sample of monkeys trained to discriminate cocaine from saline and tested with cathinones, amphetamines, and MDMA and MDA, suggested that the greater serotonergic effects of MDMA are at least partially related to the methylenedioxy structure [310]. 5.0 Epidemiological and Naturalistic Evidence Summary Evidence exists for intentional human use of MDMA in the late 1960s [46]and there are records of a police seizure of MDMA in the early 1970s [311]. An estimated 500,00 doses of MDMA were administered in a psychotherapeutic setting prior to MDMA being in Schedule I [46, 312]. MDMA was administered to thousands of people prior to scheduling and many continue to use MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 45 of 253 Ecstasy around the world in various non -medical settings [61, 193, 313-315]. In this IB, 'Ecstasy ' refers to material assumed to be MDMA used in naturalistic settings, however when used in these uncontrolled settings, the drug may not contain any MDMA and is likely to be of limited purity. It may contain other substances along with or instead of MDMA, and when present, the amount of MDMA can vary widely [316-318]. These synthesized tablets may also be cut or mixed with other psychoactive substances. Substance s found mixed with MDMA studies rely on self -reported use and do not attempt to confirm that material contained MDMA. Retrospective studies, epidemiological settings and case reports of morbidity and mortality in Ecstasy users are summarized in Section 5.1 Serious Reports of Incidents, Mortality, and Mor bidity . It is important to note that the vast majority of non -clinical epidemiological studies are retrospective comparisons of people who have previously self -administered Ecstasy, a study design that is unable to eliminate the possibility that one or more predis posing factors may lead to repeated Ecstasy use [76, 315, 320]. Samples are often selected on the basis of moderate to heavy self-reported Ecstasy use, with very few studies conducted in samples reporting the levels of moderate exposu re seen in clinical trials. Many of these studies have compared people reporting use of Ecstasy with non -Ecstasy using controls, mostly as a means of detecting long -term effects of Ecstasy use, and do not appropriately match samples for polysubstance use. Findings are considered cautiously with respect to their degree of relevance for safety in clinical trials. 5.1 Serious Reports of Incidents, Mortality, and Morbidity Numerous serious events, including fatalities, have been reported in humans after Ecstasy us e in unsupervised and uncontrolled settings. These events are relatively rare given the widespread prevalence of Ecstasy use (an estimated 4% of people, or roughly 13.7 million people, ages 15 to 64 in Europe to 6.7%, of people ages 12 and older in the US) [321, 322]. The UN World Drug report concluded that an estimated 20.5 million people (0.4% of the global population) had used 'Ecstasy ' at least once in in 2018 [323]. These include hyperthermia (potentially arising from \"serotonin syndrome\"), psychiatric problems, hepatotoxicity (secondary to hyperthermia), card iac disorders and hyponatremia [77, 321, 324-326]. Set and setting likely play a role in the development of some Ecstasy -related adverse outcomes, such as vigorous exercise, lack of attention to somatic cues, and too little or too much hydration combined with pharmacological action on oxytocin and/or AVP resulting in hyperthermia or hyponatremia [327, 328]. A systematic search of medical literature was conducted using the PubMed da tabase in April , July, and October 2021 using the terms \"MDMA \" and \"methylenedioxymethamphetamine .\" Further examination of the literature was conducted to include specific classes of report, such as clinical trials, case reports, epidemiological studies, intended to capture relevant primary literature. The reports of serious morbidity and mortality where MDMA was detected in plasma or other fluids are summarized in Table 3 below. Most Ecstasy -related emergency department admissions are the result of people experiencing anxiety or panic reactions after use and were treated with supportive care [325, 329, 330]. An extensive systematic review reached similar conclusions concerning the frequency and nature of emergency department admissions, though also noting that owing to complexities of nonmedical and recreational use, the researchers found it hard to establi sh a lethal dose [77]. However, a pair of case series drawn from two different events suggests a general relationship between estimated dose and number of emergency department admissions after exhibiting seizures, unresponsiveness or hyperthermia, with both series reporting high doses of MDMA (230 and 270 mg) in sample tablets or capsules [331, 332]. Post-mortem hyperthermia due to a deadly MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 46 of 253 intoxication by Ecstasy was found in a 19-year old female . Toxicology results showed the presence of MDMA w ith a lethal blood concentration of 4.52 mg/mL and detection of cannabinoid with a blood concentration to 0.7 ng/mL. The MDMA concentration was 8.96 mg/mL in the bile and 129.7 mg/mL in the gastric content. The blood alcohol concentration was 0.8 g/L [333]. As is the case with fatalities associated with reports of Ecstasy use, medical emergencies after Ecstasy use are more likely to occur in men [325]. Individuals consuming Ecstasy with pre -existing conditions are at increased risk when consuming drugs of unknown purity, identity, and dose in uncontrolled settings.

There were 513 case reports , with 231 case reports of morbid ity and 282 case reports of mortality , associated with Ecstasy use from 1986 through 2021 are summarized in Table 3. Of these 282 case reports of mortality , 32 were described in a cumulative 2002 literature review with incomplete cit ations of sources, and are conservatively reported in addition to individual case reports of morbidities in the literature [334]. Detectable levels of MDMA in blood or urine are reported in less than half of these case reports, and range from 50 ng/mL (reported as less than 0.05 mg/L) in the case of anaphylactic shock [406] to 1500 ng/mL (reported as 1.5 mg/L) in a fatal case of hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis [353]. Assessment of brain and blood MDMA in 11 fatalities under forensic autopsy detected lower doses in deaths where MDMA was determined to be incidental (accident, homicide) or detected in combination wit h other drugs versus blood and brain levels in a pair of deaths where cause of death was MDMA and no other drugs [440]. It is more difficult to associate events with MDMA when the compound is not detected or when detection is for amphetamines in general. Some events, such as valvular heart disease ( VHD ), acute hepatitis wi th gallbladder inflammation, liver disease, or urinary retention occurred in individuals who self -reported daily use for months to years prior to the event. In the majority of the 202 poisoning cases with unknown cause of death MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 48 of 253 in the UK and Wales between 1996 and 2002, Ecstasy was used in combination with opiates [436]. Polysubstance use is common in the majority of serious reports presented. Researchers sought to calculate the rate of fatalities associated with Ecstasy use within a nation or across nations in a given time period in studies that reported Ecstasy ingestion in at least some fatalities [441]. An examination of reports made to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS ) database found that fatalities associated with Ecstasy use were incredibly rare (946 of 13,773,614 cases), and only two of these cases (0.2%) were associated with Ecstasy and no other substance . More typically, these fatalities were associated with coadministration of opiates, benzodiazepines, and stimulants. An examination of Ecstasy -related fatalities in Portugal, Turkey, Finland and Australia from 2001 to 2019 was conducted [442]. Standardized fatalities per 100,000 ranged from lower than 0.05 per 100,000 in Portugal to 0.35 per 100,000 in Turkey. These analyses of large national datasets are in agreement with low estimated fatalit y rates due to Ecstasy use . 5.1.1 Thermoregulatory Disorders Thermoregulatory disorders play a part in the development of a constellation of disorders across body systems. Primary symptoms are hyperthermia resulting in rhabdomyolysis described in 138 reports of morbidity and 46 reports of mortality, constituting the most common acute and serious adverse effect associated with Ecstasy [77, 443]. Thermoregulatory effects of Ecstasy taken in epidemiolog ical settings are highly dependent on dose [443, 444] and permissive factors, including high ambient temperature [445, 446], crowded conditions involving overwhelming social interaction, physical exertion, reduced fluid intake [445], and thyroid dysregulation [447, 448]. Sympathomimetic effects of MDMA, at unknown doses and purity, in combination with permissive factors in uncontrolled settings, can lead to serious report s of acute and persisting adverse effects on multiple organs. In research settings, the risk of hyperthermia is limited by controlling ambient temperature, conducting treatment sessions in relaxed, private environments, and generally limiting permissive fa ctors. In addition to a case of hyperthermia and delayed rhabdomyolysis in a 20 -year old man listing detectable MDMA [351], recent reports describe hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis wherein Ecstasy use is based upon self -report or the report of friends [364, 449-451]. 5.1.2 Cardiac Disorders Cardiac disorders associated with Ecstasy in the context of hyperthermia resulted in 16 reports of morbidity and 13 reports of mortality. Several fatal cases of cardiac arrest were reported. The elevation of blood pressure and increased heart rate produced by MDMA, similar to that produced by other sympathomimetic drugs, can lead to additional risks and complications [408, 409, 452], such as stroke, cardiac events, or other cerebrovascular events, including cerebral venous sinus thrombosis [453] and cerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage cases, a previously existi ng underlying arteriovenous malformation appeared to play a role in the event [454, 456]. High plasma MDMA concentrations occurred in another case of cardiac arrest that also included extreme hyperthermia [371]. Intra -cardiac pressures, intra -arterial pressures, angiotensin II, pain, and adrenergic (2) central nervous stimuli can also influence AVP secretion [459]. Increased AVP concentration, which is also caused by MDMA as described in Section 6.2.3.2 Cardiovascular System , is described in several studies as a strong predictor of mortality in patients with chronic heart failure and acute heart failure, and contributes to increases in blood pressure [460]. As with any amphetamine, increased heart rate (tachycardia) and elevated blood pressure can also lead to cardiac events, such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction [355, 367]. Fatal dysrhythmias h ave been reported following heavy Ecstasy use, resulting in ventricular fibrillation and asystole. Individuals with underlying cardiac and/or MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 49 of 253 pulmonary disease and preexisting conditions such as Wolff -Parkinson -White syndrome are especially at risk for hea rt failure and fatal arrhythmias. Although the presence of MDMA was rarely confirmed in reported cases, these types of events are all well -established complications of hypertension and can occur after use of amphetamines. Some researchers have expressed c oncern that MDMA activity at 5HT 2B receptors might be indicative of increasing risk of valvular heart disease (VHD) with repeated use [24]. Studies in Ecstasy users indicated that only people reporting average lifetime exposure of 900 tablets had cardiac abnormalities indicative of potential VHD [461], and a case of VHD has occurred in a man reporting approximately 16 years of heavy Ecstasy use, from age 17 to 33 years old. [362]. No abnormalities were found in people reporting lifetime exposure of approximately 200 tablets in the same study. VHD only occurred after extremely heavy Ecsta sy use. Ecstasy can alter cardiac function leading to rhythm disturbances and sudden death , as seen in a case report of a 16 year old woma n who ingested 1 g of Ecstasy [462]. However, echocardiographic readings in a prospective study testing 1.5 mg/kg MDMA HCl conducted in Ecstasy users (N=8, reported use mean 49 +/ - 65 times, range 5 -200) failed to find any structural cardiac abnormalities [37]. A non -fatal cardiac arrest occurred in the context of a genetic arrhythmia disorder, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia [357]. A non -fatal cardiac arrest occurred in a 19 -year old man w ith a history of previous substance use who collapsed at work , apparently after ingesting MDMA and amphetamine, with detectable levels of both drugs found in blood [364]. Apparent use of Ecstasy, with concurrent use of other amphetamines during pregnancy, was ass ociated with seizures and myocardial infarction [360, 361]. As evidenced by these reports, individuals consuming Ecstasy with pre -existing conditions that can influence cardiovascular and cardiac function are at increased risk when consuming drugs of unknown purity, identity, and dose in uncontrolled setti ngs. 5.1.3 Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders Disorders classified as 'Metabolism and nutrition disorders' associated with Ecstasy in the context of hyperthermia resulted in 19 reports of morbidity and seven reports of mortality, with acute renal failure (ARF) as the most common cause of death. Ecstasy use has been associated with acute symptomatic hyponatremia with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic -hormone secretion [233]. AVP plays a key role in osmoregulation, and is released upon a change in plasma osmolality [235]. AVP is also involved in the response and adaptation to stress, through its effects on the HPA axis [235]. The rise in AVP results from a pharmacological effect of MDMA compounded by excessi ve fluid ingestion [236]. SIADH refers to disorders related to water and sodium balance characterized by the impairment of urina ry dilution and hypotonic hyponatremia in the absence of renal disease or other identifiable non -osmotic stimuli known to activate the release of AVP [234]. In Ecstasy users with confirmed urinary MDMA, a significant association was found between plasma osmolality, plasma s odium, and CYP2D6 -activity genotypes [463]. Effects of Ecstasy, combined with increased consumption of water and perm issive factors, such as strenuous exercise in warm ambient temperatures, can be further exacerbated in the context of poor metabolism. Gauging appropriate water intake may be difficult for users to estimate because MDMA reduces perception of thirst and imp airs judgment [464]. A number of case reports describe hyponatremia after uncontrolled, non -medical Ecstasy use [326, 327, 465, 466]. A recent meta -analysis showed that a moderate reduction of serum sodium concentration is associated with an increased risk of death in different pathologic conditions MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 50 of 253 [467]. Relationships have been found between reduced plasma sodium, a measure of hyponatremia, and variations in COMT and CYP2D6 genotypes, possibly related to increased AVP and oxytocin release associate d with MDMA [463]. Active doses of MDMA likely inhibit CYP2D6 in most individuals, as described in Section 6.2.1 Pharmacokinetics and Product Metabolism in Humans . Behavioral factors, including vigorous exercise and excessive consumption of wat er without an attempt to replace electrolytes, and an increase in the anti - diuretic hormones AVP and oxytocin, likely all contribute to this very rare but serious condition in Ecstasy users [468]. Women are generally more likely to exhibit hyponatremia than men [469, 470], including Ecstasy or MDMA related hyponatremia [326]. Heart failure is commonly associated with hyponatremia, and is also characterized by increased concentrations of AVP [471-473]. Increased AVP secretion caused by MDMA in combination with permissive factors in uncontrolled settings can lead to serious reports of acute and persisting adverse effects on multiple organs, including the liver. Individuals consuming Ecstasy with pre -existing conditions that can influence renal function are at increased risk. In response to this risk, many users tend to overcompensate with excessive consumption of water, leading to dil utional hyponatremia. Prevention of hyponatremia with limited consumption of electrolyte containing fluids and controlled ambient temperatures are required to preserve the body's homeostatic maintenance of fluid balance. A patient with Insulin -dependent d iabetes mellitus consumed alcohol and Ecstasy which caused diabetic ketoacidosis [391]. An autopsy revealed microhemorrhages in the brain with subnuclear vacuolization and Armanni -Ebstein changes in renal tubes. A low level of MDMA was found in the blood (<0.01 mg/L). 5.1.4 Hepatobiliary Disorders Hepatobiliary disorders associated with Ecstasy use resulted in four reports of morbidity and five reports of mortality. One of the mortality reports happened 1 week after Ecstasy use and was consistent with acute fulminant hepatitis in the absence of viral infection. This patient died despite liver transplantation efforts [395]. Mortality result ed from disseminated intravascular coagulation caused by platelet dysfunction associated with liver failure. Non -fatal morbidity reports range from acute hepa titis associated with daily usage of five to eight tablets of Ecstasy for 3 months in combination with alcohol [392] to liver damage in combination with congestive cardiomyopathy [363]. Acute, but non -fatal, liver failure occurred in a 17 -year old man, also exhibit ing tachycardia and hyperthermia , who had ingested cocaine, ethanol , and Ecsta sy and was treated with a molecular adsorbent; drug quantification or detection is not listed in the report [451]. Given that polysubstance use and prior insult to liver function cannot be ruled out, the frequency of isolated serious hepatotoxicity cases in th e absence of hyperthermia are rare among serious reports associated with Ecstasy use. Hepatotoxicity is more common among serious reports in combination with hyperthermia and acute renal failure. 5.1.5 Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders Blood and lymphatic system disorders associated with Ecstasy use resulted in three morbidity reports and one mortality report of aplastic anemia. The death after aplastic anemia occurred from complications of immunosuppressant therapy followed by an alloge nic stem cell transplant, 17 months after the first admission [402]. The patient had initially presented with progressive weakness and epistaxis, resulti ng from daily Ecstasy use for 7 months, combined with heavy alcohol intake. Further examination revealed the replacement of bone marrow tissue with fatty deposits, likely due to alcohol consumption and exacerbated by chronic Ecstasy use. Three MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 51 of 253 reports of m orbidity ranged in prior Ecstasy use levels from one to four times in the prior year, with two cases spontaneously resolving within 2 months and the treated case failing immunosuppressive therapy and recovering 4 months after subsequent bone marrow transpl ant [402]. 5.1.6 Injuries, Poisonings, and Procedural Complications MDMA may provoke allergic or immune responses in some people. Though rarely reported in the literature, there are several such cases on record. One of the clearest cases is that of a uvular edema that occurred in a 31 -year old male after ingesting Ecstasy later determined to be 71% MDM A [405]. A prick test confirmed a positive immune reaction to the material, and there is a report of a previous occurrence of this response in t he same individual [438]. A report of possible anaphylactic shock and subsequent death occurred in a 13 -year old girl who had at least one previous exposure to Ecstasy [406]. Her friends reported that she experienced swelling lips after her first exposure. After approximately 1.5 tablets, the girl experienced nausea and vomited, and later had difficulty breathing. On admission she was hypothermic and hypotensive. A low level of MDMA (<0.5 mg/dL) was detected in blood. None of the other individuals consuming tablets from the same batch underwent similar experiences. Autopsy found a massive brain edema as well as laryngeal oedema and lung congestion. Chemical analyses ruled out hyponatremia. The reaction may have been to MDMA or to an adulterant in the tablet. The authors of the report do not report whether tablets were assessed for contents. A report of swo llen lips in a woman with detectable levels of MDMA in blood (1.466 mg/L) is ambiguous as to cause of swelling, since the patient may have experienced a sexual assault and injuries in transit to ER, and cannot clearly be established as an allergic reaction [404]. 5.1.7 Gastrointestinal Disorders Gastrointestinal disorders resulted in 15 reports of morbidity including xerostomia, bruxism, and dental erosion in the context of Ecstasy use. Between 93 to 99% of Ecstasy users experience dry mouth or xerostomia at higher doses for up to 48 hours after cons umption of Ecstasy, which can lead to enamel erosion [419]. Jaw clenching and grinding of teeth is frequently reported during Ecstasy use as well as in clinical trials. Tooth wear through the enamel into the underlying bone occurred in 60% of Ecstasy users versus 11% of non -users in one study, which was attributed to jaw clenching rather than tooth grinding [419]. Necrotizing gingivitis and tenderness in the temporomandibular joint were also reported. 5.1.8 Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders resulted in 9 reports of morbidity and one report of mortality in the context o f Ecstasy use. A single mortality report of airway necrosis occurred in a 25-year-old male who had a history of occasional Ecstasy use by inhalation. The patient was initially found unresponsive and was resuscitated, but airway necrosis due to vasoconstric tion of airway walls led to hypoxic cardiac arrest [433]. This report is not consistent with the usual respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal adverse outcomes reported from oral administration of Ecstasy. The mortality report is likely due to the patient's chosen route of administration. 5.1.9 Psychiatric Disorders Psychiatric disorders associated with Ecstasy use resulted in 4 morbidity reports and no mortality reports. Psychiatric problems after uncontrolled, non -medical Ecstasy u se were reported in 22.1% of 199 case reports from the early 1990s to 2001 and are a common reason for appearance at an emergency department [465]. Psychiatric symptoms included affective responses, such as MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 52 of 253 dysph oria, anxiety, panic, and psychotic response, as well as cases with mixed psychotic and affective features. The most common problem reported included panic, restlessness and psychotic response, as seen a systematic review and several epidemiological case s eries [77, 474]. The mechanisms behind Ecstasy -associated psychiatric problems remain unclear but are likely the result of an interaction between pharmacology and individual susceptibility. The difficulty of assessing the frequency of these events is increased given that pre -existing psychiatric problems occur in people who choose to use Ecstasy [475] and findings of an association between use of Ecstasy and othe r drugs and self -reported symptoms of anxiety and depression. As described earlier, most cases of psychological distress after Ecstasy use resolved after supportive care [325, 330]. Anxiety responses associated with MDMA administration repor ted in controlled trials have resolved over time, usually either during the period of acute drug effect or with the waning of drug effects. Previous reports have found an association between Ecstasy use and symptoms of depression or anxiety [476, 477]. A meta -analysis of self -reported depressive symptoms detected an association between Ecstasy use and self -reported depression symptoms [478]. However, the association was strongest in studies with small samples, and drug use variables were often incompletely reported and not verified. Many studies found that increases in self -reported anxiety or depression were more strongly related to polydrug use rather than to use of any one subs tance [479-482]. Two studies found an equal or stronger association between regular use of ca nnabis, and not Ecstasy, with anxiety, depression or other psychological problems [483, 484]. An assessment of me n reporting substance use in a large cohort found that the highest degree of mental health problems in respondents reporting Ecstasy use in the last 12 months, followed by those reporting stimulant use [485]; stressful life events and perceived stress also differed across groups. Anxiety regarding loss of control under the influence of Ecstasy could develop to a degree where it could lead to panic attacks. Case reports have been published describing panic att acks in individuals under the acute influence of Ecstasy [486]. Enduring panic attacks have been reported in i ndividuals after repeated Ecstasy use [487, 488] and in one case, even after a single dose [489]. When compared with polydrug using controls, people who use Ecstasy re port being more empathetic and exhibit greater cognitive empathy when viewing photographs of expressive emotions [490], and did not differ in degree of reaction to social exclusion. These findings may be affected by the same problems as other retrospective studies, such as the presence of another factor or factors influencing empathy and drug use patterns. Neuroendocrine response to oral citalopram did not differ between Ecstasy users, cannabis users and controls [491]. People reporting regular drug use and Ecstasy use had higher levels of salivary cortisol in the evening, and higher salivary cortisol on the day of a multitasking activity [492], and higher salivary cortisol on waking that was unrelated to prefrontal SERT binding or self-reported depression symptoms [493]. A 4 -year longitudinal study reported that factors other than Ecstasy use, including female sex and presence of financial and relationship difficulties, were more closely r elated to self -reported symptoms of depression [494]. Comparison of self - reported psychological symptoms in samples of people grouped by self -reported drug use found current Ecstasy users had lower global symptom severity scores than polydrug users [495]. In conclusion, it appears that the relationship between Ecstasy use on self -reported mood or psychiatric problems is not strong, with equal or stronger involvement of other factors. 5.1.10 Nervous System Disorders Nervous System disorders associated with Ecstasy use resulted in 15 morbidity reports and no mortality reports. Memory difficulties arising immediately after Ecstasy use have been reported in a sporadic user [413]. The memory difficulties arose in a man reporting use of Ecstasy five or MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 53 of 253 six times, with confusion and cognitive impairment reportedly occurring after taking a single tablet at a party. Cognitive function was assessed 7 years later. Ima ging showed signs of hippocampal sclerosis. It is not clear from the report whether the individual used Ecstasy prior to or after this event. The individual had hypertension, raising questions concerning possibility of a cerebrovascular event. In a report of a serious neurological event with 0.83 ng/mL MDMA detected in the hair of a girl who developed encephalopathy [412] during chronic low or moderate Ecstasy use, cognitive function and memory problems associated with neurological damage was reported. Upon cessation of use 16 months later, extensive hippocampal remodeling was reported assessed through positron emission tomography (PET) scans. This finding is consistent with hippocampal dendritic spine remodeling observed in rats receiving 20 mg/kg MDMA HCl for 4 days intended to simulate chronic usage in humans [496], however, the clinical presentation was also similar to CNS herpes infection, so it is difficult to attribute this isolated case report to only Ecstasy use. Two reports have identified bilateral lesions in the globus pallidus of Ecstasy users during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or autopsy, with a third report finding hippocampal changes in imaging associated with amnestic syndrome [414-416]. Due to the retrospective and infrequent nature of these reports, it is difficult to determine causality. Many researchers have studied the effects of repeated non -medical or recreational use of Ecstasy in humans [69-71, 497]. Early investigations had several methodological flaws, including retrospective design and poor ma tching of Ecstasy users with appropriate controls [76, 498]. Later studies sought to remedy some of these problems by using carefully matched polydrug user or cannabis user controls, or by relying on a sample w ith relatively low exposure to psychoactive substances, including alcohol [499-502]. Researchers comparing the average reported Ecstasy/MDMA use of samples in imaging studies with average use in a large, global internet survey found participants in imaging studies were in the top 5 to 10% in terms of size of usual dose and amount taken per o ccurrence [503]. Imaging studies may not represent effects in people reporting average use, or in people enrolled in clinical trials. Some of these investigators also conducted longitudinal studies, co mparing Ecstasy users, sometimes alongside controls, at two separate time points [504-506]. Retrospective studies comparing Ecstasy users with various control groups have investigated brain serotonin, sleep architecture and quality, verbal memory and executive function. Most, but not all, detect at long -term deleterious effects in samples of people who use Ecstasy . Retrospective designs, compounded with lack of information concerning exposure and insufficiently matched controls, limits their interpretability. Most studies have suggested that heavy, but not moderate, Ecstasy users had impaired verbal memory and lower numbers of estimated SERT sites, assessed via imaging with radioactively labeled ligands in PET or single photon emission tomography (SPECT), with heavy use often defined as 50 or more times or tablets. Taken together, findings from these studies suggest there is some risk of long -term effects in heavy Ecstasy users with respect to number of estimated SERT sites in s pecific brain areas and performance on measures of memory. However, interpreting findings of changes in serotonin receptors or cognitive function after repeated Ecstasy use are complicated by the possible impact of polydrug use and other potential pre - existing factors in retrospective reports, and the findings are not readily transferrable to use of MDMA in a therapeutic or research context. 5.2 Cognitive Function and Performance Many investigations have examined cognitive function in Ecstasy users with the go al of demonstrating long -term effects of purported neurotoxicity of Ecstasy. Rogers and colleagues performed a meta -analysis on a large number of retrospective studies of Ecstasy users and various cognitive functions. Given methodological flaws in this typ e of analysis, the investigators MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 54 of 253 cautiously concluded that there might be a significant effect of Ecstasy use on verbal memory, and a lesser effect on visual memory [77]. Retrospective designs and inappropriately matched samples continue to appear in the literature [507-509], even when using multiple control groups. Two meta -analyses of memory in Ecstasy users a rrived at somewhat contradictory conclusions [510, 511]. Both detected an association between Ecstasy use and impaired performance on at least some measures of memory. However, one repor ted that this association had a medium to large effect size with no effect of Ecstasy dose [510], while the other reported that the association had a small to medium effect size with an Ecstasy dose effect, and that polydrug use itself contributed to impaired cognitive function [511]. In a prospective study comparing cognitive function in people before and up to 18 months after reported initiation of Ecstasy use, Schilt and colleagues found an association between Ecstasy use and performance on measures of verbal me mory, but not attention or working memory [512]. All scores were within normal range; peop le who did not use Ecstasy showed greater improvement in performance at the second time of assessment than people reporting some use. A second prospective study examined working memory in people reporting Ecstasy use similar to participants in Schilt's stu dy with controls and failed to find any significant differences in working memory and selective attention [513]. An analysis of findings from largely retrospective studies of Ecstasy users reported a small deficit in verbal or working memory [77]. Retrospective studies of polydrug users wh o use Ecstasy and controls reported impaired global motion processing without changes to local processing [514]. Not all studies report that Ecstasy users fare worse on measures of cognitive function than controls, and methodological critiques and at least one commentary and review discuss the contribution of research and publicatio n bias in driving findings [515]. Several reports detected little or no significant differences between Ecstasy users and polydrug user controls in performance on tasks of cognitive function [320, 513, 516-521], though other studies continue to find consistent differences, particularly in verbal memory [522-526]. Regular use of many substances, including alcohol, may affect cognitive function, with Ecstasy being only one of those substances [527]. Several reports have found relationships between cognitive function and use of other drugs as well as or instead of Ecstasy [516, 518, 522, 528-530]. The only study attempting to address effects of Ecstasy use on cognitive function in middle aged versus younger users did not find a greater degree of impairment [531]. A meta -analysis comparing current Ecstasy users and drug -using controls on visuosp atial skills reported that current users performed less well on measures of visual recall, recognition and item production than controls [532], but found no significant relationship between lifetime Ecstasy use and visuospatial task performance. A longitudinal study comparing peo ple who continued to use Ecstasy with those who did not do so detected lower performance on immediate and delayed visual memory [533]. In a second follow -up in the same sample reported lower scores in visual memory, at marginal significance and no further impairment [534]. An examination of the relationship between elements of Ecstasy use history and verbal memory reported that use in the past year, especially in men, was associated with impaired verbal memory [535]. The authors suggest that sex differences in polydrug use may be involved. A study comparing performance on a test of verbal memory in 65 Ecstasy users enrolled in clinical trials of MDMA and an equal number of age and sex matched non -drug using controls from other trials failed to detect significant differen ces between the two groups [536]. The nature and strength of the association between regular Ecstasy use and any impairments in executive function remains inconclusive, with studies reporting conflicting results [315, 501, 502, 537, 538]. Findings from a study published in 2014 did not find differences in multitasking [492]. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 55 of 253 A meta -analysis comparing executive fun ction in Ecstasy users and non -Ecstasy using controls found a significant effect of Ecstasy use on one component of executive function (updating), no effect on another (shifting) , and mixed results when looking at other components (response inhibition and access to long -term memory) [539]. Polydrug use likely contributes to findings of impaired executive function seen in Ecstasy users [481, 540]. Current research has not settled the question. The relationship between Ecstasy use and impulsivity has also been extensively examined, with some researchers reporting greater impulsivity in Ecstasy users and others fa iling to find any differences [70, 541]. Studies using both behavioral and self -report measures of impulsivity reached contradictory conclusions [520, 542, 543]. Two studies using the same measure of behavioral impulsivity in samples of heavy Ecstasy users obtained different findings [520, 542]. It is notable that Quednow and colleagues compared Ecstasy users with abstinent cannabis users and drug -na\u00efve controls while Roiser and colleagues compared Ecstasy users with former Ecstasy users, polydrug users and drug -na\u00efve controls, raising the possibi lity that results might have differed in part due to control group selection. It is possible that people who self -administer Ecstasy may already possess above -average levels of sensation -seeking and impulsiveness. To date, all such studies have used retros pective study designs and cannot rule out this possibility, and some studies suggest that polydrug use may be equally or more strongly related to impulsivity in Ecstasy users [544-546]. A systematic review of decision -making that addressed many of these studies concluded that the current research does not permit drawing conclusions concerning effects of long -term Ecstasy use on decision -making [547]. Adolescents \"at risk\" for stimulant use, including MDMA, repo rted greater rates of gambling than at -risk adolescents not reporting stimulant use, with gambling considered a possible marker of impulsivity [548]. The relationship between drug use, including Ecstasy use, and impulsivity, is complex, including likely contributions of impulsivity and risk -assessment decisions on the decision to ini tiate and continue Ecstasy use that make it difficult to assess causality. 6.0 Effects in Humans in Clinical Settings 6.1 History of Use in Clinical Settings Shulgin and Nichols were the first to report on the effects of MDMA in humans [48]. In the 1970s, psychotherapists used MDMA -assisted therapy to treat psychological disorders including anxiety [55]. Legal therapeutic use of MDMA continued until its placement on the U. S. list of Schedule I drugs in 1985 [54, 58, 312]. An estimated 500,000 doses of MDMA were administered during therapy sessions in North America prior to its scheduling [46, 312]. A few uncontrolled human studies of MDMA occurred in the 1980s [36, 51] including Greer and Tolbert's study of MDMA in a psychotherapeutic context. Controlled human studies of MDMA commenced in the mid -1990s with a MAPS funded investigator -initiated Phase 1 dose -response safety study [40, 549]. As of October 01, 2021 , approximately 78 human trials with MDMA have been conducted globally over the past four decades outside the development program (N=1,441 ) (see Appendix Table 1: Summary of Investigator -Initiated Trials with MDMA ). MAPS also funded a Phase 2 investigator -initiated dose-response safety and efficacy pilot study in Spain that was terminated early due to political concerns. This study enrolled six participants, with four receiving a single session of MDMA - assisted therap y without any safety concerns and some PTSD symptom reduction [78]. Based on past reports of MDMA use, nonclinical studies, and the results from these investigator - initiated trials with MDMA, the sponsor launched a Phase 2 Clinical Development Program in 2001 to develop MDMA -assisted therapy for the treatment of chronic PTSD under a U.S. IND. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 56 of 253 Eleven sponsor -supported studies of MDMA -assisted therapy for PTSD have been completed . The sponsor has initiated or plans to initiate several Phase 1 studies, at least one Phase 2 study including a study in Europe and at least one Phase 3 study . These studies will include studies of MDMA pharmacokinetics, additional studies of MDMA -assisted therapy in people with PTSD and a Phase 2 study of MDMA -assisted therapy in people with eating disorders (see Table 5 : Summary of Ongoing and Planned Sponsor -Supported Trials with MDMA ). As of October 01, 2021 , 358 individuals were exposed to MDMA in the sponsor's clinical development program across various indications .MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 57 of 253 Table 4: Summary of Completed Sponsor Supported Trials with MDMA A Study NCT # Location Population Therapy Teams (n) MDMA HCl Initial Dose B MDMA HCl Supplementary Dose B,C Design Exposed to MDMA at Any Dose D Publications PTSD MP-1 NCT00090064 Charleston, South Carolina Crime, veterans 1 Placebo (n=8), 125 mg (n=15) Placebo, 62.5 mg Blinded RCT, Stage 2 22 [41, 79] MP-2 NCT00353938 Switzerland Various 1 25 mg (n=5), 125 mg (n=9) 12.5 mg, 62.5 mg Blinded RCT, open -label Stage 2 Open label Stage 3 14 [42] MP-3 NCT00402298 Beer Yaakov, Israel Various 1 25 mg (n=2), 125 mg (n=3) 12.5 mg, 62.5 mg Blinded RCT, planned Stage 2 5 Terminated early MP-4 NCT01958593 Vancouver, Canada Various 2 Placebo (n=2), 125 mg (n=4) Placebo, 62.5 mg Blinded RCT, open -label Stage 2 6 Terminated early MP-8 NCT01211405 Charleston, South Carolina Veterans, firefighters, police officers 1 30 mg (n=7), 75 mg (n=7), 125 mg (n=12) 15 mg, 37.5 mg, 62.5 mg Blinded RCT, open -label Stage 2 26 [550] MP-9 NCT01689740 Be'er Ya 'aqov, Israel Various 5 25 mg (n=3), 125 mg (n=7) E 12.5 mg, 62.5 mg Blinded RCT, open -label Stage 2 10 MP-12 NCT01793610 Boulder, Colorado Various 9 40 mg (n=6), 100 mg (n=9), 125 mg (n=13) 20 mg, 50 mg, 62.5 mg Blinded RCT, Open label Stage 2 28 PTSD 4 75 mg (1st session ), 100 mg (2nd session ) 37.5 mg, 50 mg Open label Phase1/Phase 2 12 [552] MP16 NCT03282123 Multi -site; US, Israel Various 33 80 mg, 100 mg 40 mg, 50 mg Open label 33 [86] MP17 NCT03485287 Multi -site, Canada Various 4 100 mg, 125 mg 50 mg, 62.5 mg Open label 4 [86] MAPP1 NCT03537014 Multi -site; US, Canada, Israel Various 40 Placebo 80 mg (1st session s), 80 or 120 mg (2nd, 3rd sessions) Placebo, 40 mg, 40 mg or 60 mg Blinded RCT 46 [30] MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 58 of 253 Social anxiety MAA -1 NCT02008396 Los Angeles, CA Adults on autism spectrum with social anxiety 1 Placebo (n=4), 75-125 mg (8) Placebo, 32 mg to 53 mg Blinded RCT, open -label arm 12 [89] Illness/ Anxiety MDA -1 NCT02427568 San Anselmo, CA Anxiety related to life - threatening illness 3 Placebo (n=5), 125 mg (n=13) Placebo, 62.5 mg Blinded RCT, Open Label Stage 2 18 [553] Healthy Controls MPVA -4 NCT03181763 Atlanta, GA Healthy, aged 21-55, prev. experience w/MDMA N/A Placebo, 100 mg determined A Completed Studies indicates that all subjects have completed the study.

MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 61 of 253 6.1.1 Phase 1 Studies The sponsor has one completed (MPVA -4) and one ongoing (MT-1) Phase 1 studies. MPVA -4 is a Phase 1, randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blinded between -groups study in 34 healthy participants examining the effects of MDMA on presence and intensity of startle response after receiving cues that were previously paired with a startling stimulus. Participants receive d 100 mg MDMA HCl or placebo and repeated the startle -related task with the same cues in the absence of the startling stimuli to assess the effect of MDMA or placebo on the startle response. This study concluded in October 2020 ; the findings have been submitted for publication and the Clinical Study Report (CSR) is in preparation . In ongoing study MT -1, healthy volunteers who have had completed training in MDMA -assisted therapy undergo two sessions in a within -subject, double -blind crossover study, receiving placebo during one session and 125 mg MDMA HCl during the other. Subjective effects, mood, and reactions are also being assessed in the ongoing Phase 1 placebo -controlled study of MDMA - assisted therapy , in healthy volunteers who have completed training in MDMA -assisted therapy (MT-1). 6.1.2 Phase 2 Studies Most data reported are from Phase 2 st udies of MDMA -assisted therapy for PTSD. Data from a pair of investigations of MDMA -assisted therapy for other indications are also presented. These studies have administered MDMA in divided doses, with an initial dose administered at the start of the sess ion and a supplemental dose following 1.5 to 2 hours later. The supplemental dose given at approximately peak exposure from the initial dose does not significantly impact intensity of pharmacodynamic effects but does enable a longer period to process traum a in the context of dosing sessions. Studies have employed a range of comparator and active doses from an initial dose of 25 mg to 150 mg MDMA HCl. The lowest dose in use has been 25 mg MDMA HCl , used as a placebo or low dose comparator in studies MP -2 and MP-9. Typically, Stage 1 was blinded and Stage 2 was open -label in which participants who received placebo or comparator doses in Stage 1 received active MDMA. The highest initial dose (150 mg MDMA HCl ) was offered to a limited number of participants in M P-2 as part of \"Stage 3,\" an open -label arm for non - responders in Stage 1 and/or Stage 2. The most common dosing regimen employed was 125 mg MDMA HCl followed by a supplemental dose of 62.5 mg as the primary active treatment. The supplemental dose given at approximately peak exposure from the initial dose does not significantly impact intensity of pharmacodynamic effects but does enable a longer period to process trauma in the context of dosing sessions. In sponsor -supported studies, MDMA or placebo/comparator is administered after preparatory therapy during two or three 8 -hour dosing sessions scheduled 2 to 5 weeks apart, each followed by at least three sessions of integrative therapy . This trea tment model is based on historical experience with MDMA use as an adjunct to therapy . See Table 4 for more details on completed studies and Table 5 on planned and ongoing studies. MAPS has completed eight blinded randomized, controlled and four open -label Phase 2 and Phase 3 investigations of MDMA -assisted therapy for PTSD including one extension study for treatment of relapse [31]. These studies explored the reproducibility and persistence of treatme nt outcomes of MDMA -assisted therapy in people with chronic PTSD , and in some protocols PTSD that failed to respond to at least one course of therapy or at least one course of pharmacotherapy. Phase 2 studies MP-1, MP-8 and MP -12, along with the Phase 2 le ad-in study MP16 are highlighted below. The three smaller Phase 2 studies (MP -4, MP -9, and MP17) are summarized below, but due to their size and design differences from the Phase 3 studies, they are not expanded on here . MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 62 of 253 6.1.2.1 Study MP -1 Study MP -1 (N=2 3) comp ared two blinded dosing sessions of MDMA (125 mg initial dose with 62.5 mg supplemental dose ) or placebo in participants with chronic, treatment -resistant PTSD from any cause, with an average age of 40.4 (SD:7.2) years. MDMA participants were subsequently offered a third dosing session with the same dose of MDMA. Placebo participants were subsequently offered participation in an open -label crossover segment wherein they underwent up to three open -label sessions with MDMA. An ITT analysis of t his study found that the decrease in CAPS -IV PTSD symptom severity was significantly greater for the MDMA group compared to the placebo group at the p rimary endpoint (p=0.002) with a large effect size (placebo -corrected Cohen's d=1.9) with early onset of treatment efficacy after the first dosing session [41]. The seven placebo participants who completed the open -label cross -over also experienced comparable reduction in CAPS -IV PTSD symptom severity. At the Primary Endpoint, 73% of active dose subjects no longer met PTSD Diagnostic Criteria, compared to 25% of subjects receiving placebo. There were no significant differences on any of the three cognitive measures (RBANS total score, PASAT Trial 1, PASAT Trial 2, Rey -Osterrieth 30 -minute delay score) or pre/post clinical laboratory assessments for safety. At Long -term follow -up, assessed 17 to 74 (mean = 45.4) months after the control study's final MDMA session , there were no statistically significant differences between mean CAPS -IV score 23.7 (SD:22.8) compared to mean CAPS -IV score obtained at study exit 24.6 (SD:18.6 ) [79]. No SARs were reported in this study. Detailed safety information from this study is included in Section 6.4 Safety of MDMA in Humans . 6.1.2.2 Study MP -8 Study MP -8 (N=26) compared 3 doses of MDMA (30 mg, 75 mg, or 125 mg MDMA HCl ) initial dose, with a supplemental dose equivalent to half the initial dose) in military veterans, firefighters , and police officers (\"first responders\") with service -related PTSD, with an average age of 37.2 (SD: 10.3) years. Each dosing arm participated in two blinded dosing s essions with the assigned dose, followed by open -label crossover (three open -label sessions consisting of a full active dose of 100 mg or 125 mg ) initial dose, with a supplemental dose equivalent to half the initial dose). These study results were publishe d in 2018 [550]. This study found that the decreases in CAPS -IV PTSD symptom severity, expressed as mean (SD) at the Primary Endpoint , in the 75 mg (-58.3 mg groups ( -44.3 ( SD:28.7)), had significantly decreased (p <0.001) 30 mg group ( -11.4 ( SD:12.7)) [550]. There was one SAR that occurred in this study: one participant experienced an increase in frequency of ventricular extrasystoles, a form of cardiac arrhythmia, on the day of his third and final dosing session with open -label 125 mg MDMA HCl . For further detail see Section 6.4.1. 5 Serious Adverse Reactions . Detailed safety information from this study is included in Section 6.4 Safety of MDMA in Humans . 6.1.2.3 Study MP -12 Study MP -12 (N=28) compared 3 doses of MDMA (40 mg, 100 mg, or 125 m g MDMA HCl initial dose, with a supplemental dose equivalent to half the initial dose) in participants with PTSD from any cause, with an average age of 42.0 (SD: 12.9) years. Each dosing arm participated in two blinded dosing sessions with the assigned dose , followed by open -label crossover (three open -label sessions in the low dose arm or one open -label session in the other two active dose arms consisting of a full active dose of 100 mg or 125 mg MDMA HCl initial dose, with a supplemental dose equivalent to half the initial dose). These study results were published in 2018 MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 63 of 253 [551]. This study found that in the intent -to-treat set, the CAPS -IV PTSD symptom severity score reduction, expressed as mean (SD), at the Primary End point were -26.3 (29.5) for 125 mg, -24.4 (24.2) for 100 mg, and -11.5 (21.2) for 40 mg, though a statistically significant reduction (p=0.03) was only demonstrated in the per protocol set for the 125 mg dose compared to the 40 mg dose [551]. Detailed safety information from this study is included in Section 6.4 Safety of MDMA in Humans . 6.1.2.4 Study MP16 Study MP16 (N=33) was conducted as a multi -site Phase 2 open -label study of MDMA -assisted therapy for PTSD. MDMA (80 mg or 120 mg MDMA HCl ) with an optional supplemental dose equal to half of the initial dose) was administered in three therapy sessions with non -drug preparatory and Integrative Session s. An aim of this was to provide supervision to newly trained therapy teams prior to participating in the Phase 3 trials. Thirty -three participants completed these studies. The findings from MP16 a nd another multi -site clinical trial ( MP17) demonstrated that the observed treatment response to MDMA -assisted therapy can be scaled and replicated by newly trained therapy teams across multiple sites . These study results were published in 2021 [86]. MP16 also included a sub -study to pilot participants returning hom e following dosing sessions with MDMA -assisted therapy without having a post -visit overnight stay. At the Primary Endpoint, the mean change in CAPS -5 total severity score from Baseline was a reduction of 30.5 (SD: 14.1 ), with 90.6% of subjects report ing a clinically significant reduction in CAPS -5 total severity and 75% of subject s no longer m eeting PTSD diagnostic criteria. Onset of treatment effectiveness was measured three to five weeks a fter the first dosing session , 21 (63.6%) subjects had a clinically significant reduction in CAPS -5 Total Severity Score, eleven (33.3%) subjects did not meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD, and two (6.1%) subjects were considered in remission, with a CAPS -5 Total Severity Score less than 11 and Loss of PTSD Diagn osis. The no overnight stay pilot sub -study group consisted of four participants and these participants showed similar improvement in both the primary and secondary outcomes . Comparing adverse events between the overnight stay and no overnight stay groups, there appeared to a greater percentage of fatigue, muscle tightness, and insomnia in the overnight stay group. However, it is difficult to compare across groups due to the small sample size (N=4) in the no overnight stay group. Overall, the no overnight s tay group did not have a greater percentage of AEs compared to the overnight stay group and there were no meaningful differences between study groups. Detailed safety information from this study is included in Section 6.4 Safet y of MDMA in Humans . 6.1.2.5 Other Phase 2 Studies The sponsor has also completed three international Phase 2 studies. Study MP -4 (N=6), conducted in Canada, compared placebo to an initial dose of 125 mg MDMA HCl, with an optional supplemental dose equivalent to half the initial dose, in participants with an average age of 47.7\u00b16.0 years . Study MP -9 (N=10), conducted in Israel, compared an initial dose of 25 mg to 125 mg MDMA HCl, with an optional supplemental dose equivalent to half the initial dose, in participants with an average age of 36.7\u00b18.0 years. Study MP17 (N=4), a parallel Canadian study to the U.S. MP16 study descri bed above, was conducted as a two -site Phase 2 open -label study of MDMA -assisted therapy for PTSD. An initial dose 100 mg or 125 mg MDMA HCl) , with an optional supplemental dose equal to half of the initial dose was administered in three therapy sessions with non -drug preparatory and Integrative Session s. Similar to MP16, one aim of this study was to provide supervision to newly train ed therapy teams prior to participating in the Phase 3 trials. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 64 of 253 The sponsor has additionally completed an open -label study of a combination of MDMA -assisted therapy and cognitive behavioral conjoint therapy in six dyads that include a participant with PTSD and a participant without PTSD, and relationship distress (MPVA -1, N=12). 6.1.3 Phase 3 Studies 6.1.3.1 Study MAPP1 Study MAPP1 is a pivotal Phase 3 trial conducted to support planned marketing authorization applications for approval of MDMA -assisted therapy to treat PTSD. This multi -site trial enrolled 131, randomize d 91, and treated 90 participants who received receive MDMA (N=46) or placebo (N=44) with identical therapy . The dosing regimen is a divided single -dose of 120 mg MDMA HCl (80 mg initial + 40 mg supplemental ) for the first session and a dose escalation to 180 mg MDMA HCl (120 mg initial + 60 mg supplemental ) during the second and third sessions. The supplemental dose and dose escalation c ould be withheld if the initial dose was not tolerated or the participant decline d. MAPP1 began enrollment in November 2018 and the study was completed in Octo ber 2020. This study included a similar sub -study to pilot participants returning home following dosing sessions with MDMA -assisted therapy (and not having a post-visit overnight stay). Demographics and baseline characteristics of study participants in MAPP1 were not significantly different in terms of race, ethnicity, sex, age, dissociative subtype of PTSD, disability, and CAPS - 5 score across study arms. The average age was 41 (SD: 11.9). The majority of participants were assigned female at birth (65.6%) and were White (76.7%) , see Table 6: Demographics of Participants in MAPP1 Study of MDMA -Assisted Therapy . The average duration of PTSD was 14.1 (SD: 11.5) years and 21.1% of participants had the dissociative subtype of PTSD. On average, participants had severe PTSD with functional impairment, as evidenced by the Baseline CAPS -5 total severity mean score of 44.1 (SD: 6.04) and the mean SDS score of 7.1 (SD: 1.9). History of suicidal ideation was highly prevalent among participants in this trial (92.2%). The majority of participants (97.8%) had tried previous therapy options, the most common of which were cognitive behaviora l therapy (CBT), eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), and group therapy. Pre -study use of PTSD medications included 17.8% who used sertraline and 6.7% who used paroxetine.

A total of 90 participants were randomized and completed dosing session 1 and received an initial dose of 80 mg MDMA HCl . Of these participants, 97.8 % (88 of 90) took the supplemental dose of 40 mg. At dosing session 2, 98.8% (83 of 84) participants escalated their dose to 120 mg MDMA HCl , and 97.6% (82 of 84) of these received the supplemental dose of 60 mg. At dosing session 3, 96.2% (76 of 79) participants received the escalation dose of 120 mg and the supplemental dose of 60 mg . One participant from the placebo with therapy group received an initial dose of 80 mg and a supplemental dose of 100 mg at the third dosing ses sion due to a dosing administration error at the site. At the Primary Endpoint, from Baseline to two months after three blinded dosing sessions , there was a significantly greater mean change in CAPS -5 total severity score in the MDMA -assisted therapy group, with a reduction of 24.4 (SD: 1 1.6), compared to the therapy paired with an inactive placebo group in which CAPS -5 score were reduced by 13.9 (SD: 11.5), p<0.0001, d=0.91. In the MDMA group, 88% of participants report ing a clinically significant reducti on in CAPS -5 total severity and 67% of participant s no longer meeting PTSD diagnostic criteria , compared to the placebo group , 62% report ing a clinically significant reduction in CAPS -5 total severity and 32% no longer meeting PTSD diagnostic criteria . This finding was supported by a positive secondary efficacy result in reducing clinician -rated functional impairment. At the Primary Endpoint, there was a significantly greater mean change in SDS scores in the MDMA group , reduction of 3.1 (SD: 2.6), compared to the placebo group , reduction of 2.0 (SD: 2.4), p=0.0116 , d=0.43 . There were no new safety signals found in MAPP1, including no increase in reported adverse events of special interest in the categories of suicidal ideation or behavior, cardiovascular, or abuse potential in the MDMA group as compared to the therapy with placebo control group.

Detailed safety information from this study is included in Section 6.4 Safety of MDMA in Humans . 6.1.4 Non-PTSD Indication Phase 2 Studies The sponsor has completed one Phase 2, placebo -controlled, double -blind study of MDMA - assisted therapy in autistic adults with social anxiety (MAA -1, N=12 ), which demonstrated improvement in social anxiety symptoms in autistic adults following MDMA -assisted therapy [89]. The sponsor has also completed one study of MDMA -assisted therapy in people experiencing anxiety in the face of a life -threatening illness (MDA -1, N=18 ), which demonstrated that MDMA was well tolerated in the population but differences in the state -trait a nxiety scale did not reach statistical significance despite a large effect size [90]. The sponsor is planning to initiate a study of MDMA -assisted therapy in people with eating disorders (MED -1). It will take place at two sites in Canada, and one in the US, and will enroll 12 people with anorexia nervosa and six with binge eating disorder. 6.2 Pharmacology in Humans The effects in humans presented in the sections below will include findings from both sponsor - supported clinical trials in patient populations as well as studies conducted in controlled laboratory settings in healthy volunteers without sponsor support. Fin dings from extensive human research being conducted on the pharmacology and mechanism of action will be presented in addition to the information required by FDA in order to support the safety profile of MDMA. Common AEs of MDMA reported in non -sponsor su pported Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers include elevation in blood pressure and heart rate, increased anxiety or dysphoria, and dilated pupils [12-15]. Some reports indicated decreased rather than increased alertness [12]. Other common AEs reported in controlled studies of MDMA include reduced appetite, dizziness, tight jaw, bruxism (tooth -grinding), disturbance in attention, impaired gait or balance, dry mouth, and thirst. Participants in some studies also reported or exhibited changes in cognition, such as increases in speed of thought or thought blocking, facilitated imag ination or recall [17], and MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 67 of 253 unusual thoughts or ideas [14]. Other less commonly reported events include paraesthesia (unusual body sensations) such as tingling or feeling hot or cold. MDMA can produce anxiety in healthy volunteers [14, 15, 17]. These effects are transient and dissipate as drug effects wane. One study found that women were more likely to report these events than men [15], while another study failed to support sex differences in reporti ng AEs [554]. The sponsor will conduct pharmacokinetic studies in humans to assess the effects of moderate hepatic impairment and effects of food or diet on MDMA metabolism concurrent with Phase 3 trials for treatment of PTSD . The following description of pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetics of MDMA are from available published literature. Beginning in the early to mid-1990s, several research teams conducted studies of the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of MDMA [15, 18, 22, 81, 253, 264, 555-557] without receiving sponsor support. 6.2.1 Pharmacokinetics and Product Metabolism in Humans The maximum proposed clinical dosing regimen consists of three divided single -dose exposures to racemic MDMA spaced approximately a month apart with a n 80 mg or 120 mg initial d ose followed by a 40 mg or 60 mg supplemental dose, administered 1.5 to 2 hours after initial dose at Cmax. Mean (%CV) Cmax and The clinical dosing regimen does not reach steady state, as the intended usage is up to 3 exposures to single -dose with at least 2 weeks washout between doses. Onset of MDMA effects occurs 30 to 60 minutes after oral administration of 75 to 125 mg [12, 13], peak effects appear 75 to 120 minutes post -drug [11, 14-16], and du ration of effects lasts from 3 to 6 hours with most effects returning to baseline or near -baseline levels 6 hours after final drug administration [14, 15, 17]. Self -reported duration of effects may increase as the dose of MDMA increases [11]. In a repeated dose study, an initial dose of 50 mg M DMA HCl, followed two hours later by a second dose of 100 mg MDMA HCl , does not significantly extend the duration of measurable physiological or subjective effects in comparison to a single dose of 100 mg MDMA HCl [265]. Orally administered MDMA has a half -life of 7 to 9 hours in humans and half-life is non-significantly extended from 10.41 hours to 10.48 hours if an additional dose is administered 2 hours after an initial dose [265]. MDMA and its metabolites have been found in oral fluid samples at much higher concentrations than in plasma, for 24 to 48 hours for the former and 12 to 47 hours for the latter after oral a dministration of 1 to 1.6 mg/kg MDMA HCl [558]. The potential for MDMA to be a n inhibitor or substrate of human transporters was evaluated in a validated in vitro system. This in vitro interaction study demonstrated that MDMA: is not a substrate for BCRP, MDR1, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 at not an inhibitor of MATE2 -K, OAT1, and OAT3 at up to 50 \u00b5M concentrations. In vitro MDMA is an inhibitor of MATE1 (IC 50 of 6.90 \u00b5M), hOCT1 (IC 50 of 2.15 \u00b5M), and hOCT2 (IC 50 of 1.91 \u00b5M). In order to predict whether a drug has the potential to inhibit these transporters, the unbound C max/IC 50 value must be greater than 0.1 [559]. Previous data demonstrates that the unbound fraction of MDMA in human plasma to be 49% at therapeutically active concentration (200 ng/mL) [560] and the C max mean to be 223.5\u00b138.5 ng/mL, using 125 mg MDMA HCl [232]. Based on these findings, unbound C max was estimated to be 0.48 \u00b5M. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 68 of 253 For MATE1, at this concentration, the unbound ICmax/IC 50 value for MATE1 is <0.1 and the IC 50 is no greater than 50 -fold over unbound C max, indicating that MDMA is unlikely to inhibit MATE1 , in vivo both hOCT1 and value and hOCT2=0.25), suggesting inhibition potential . Hepatic inlet max for MDMA was not evaluated in vivo . However, because 1) the relative inhibition s of hOCT1 and OCT2 are less than 25% ; 2) hOCT2 are less than 25% , based on unbound C max/IC 50 values , MDMA is metabolized through multiple metabolic pathways ; and 3) MDMA is given as a single divided dose regimen spaced 3 -5 weeks apart, transporter -based interactions are unlikely to be clinically significant. 6.2.1.1 Absorption MDMA has not been studied in humans with i .v. administration. As such, absolute or relative bioavailability is unknown. At a dose of 75 mg, MDMA is rapidly absorbed in humans, with an observed T max of 1.8\u00b10.4 hours by the oral route. At higher oral doses of 125 mg a slightly longer Tmax 2.4\u00b11.0 ho urs was observed [18]. 6.2.1.2 Distribution MDMA has been shown to be partially bound to plasma pr oteins in humans. The unbound fraction of MDMA in human plasma was measured to be 49% at therapeutically active concentration (200 ng/mL) [560]. The volume of distribution of MDMA at 1 mg/kg was observed to be 5.5\u00b11.1 L/kg (dose range based on weight 43 mg -106 mg) in humans [253]. The volume of distribution of MDMA at 1.6 mg/kg was observed to be 5.5\u00b11.3 L/kg (dose range based on weight 69 mg -150 mg) in humans [253]. 6.2.1.3 Metabolism MDMA metabolism in the liver is saturable in a dose -dependent manner and follows non -linear pharmacokinetics. MDMA is metabolized by N -demethylation to the only active metabolite MDA by CYP2B6, followed by compound and MDA are further O -demethylated to HHMA and HHA, respectively. Both HHMA and HHA are subsequently O -methylated mainly to HMMA and HMA. These four metabolites, particularly HMMA and HMA, are excreted in the urine as conjugated glucuronide or sulfate metabolites. Metabolites of MDMA are summarized in Figure 2 [561-566]. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 69 of 253 Figure 2: Metabolism of MDMA in Humans Metabolism of MDMA in humans (in red) compared to metabolism in rats (in blue). Reproduced with permission of R. de la Torre [252]. It is likely that act ive doses of MDMA inhibit CYP2D6 function, as measured by examining the effects of MDMA on dextromethorphan metabolism. Inhibition of CYP2D6 by MDMA was demonstrated first in a physiological model derived from data collected after oral administration in hu mans [567]. O'Mathuna and colleagues present eviden ce that CYP2D6 activity may not fully recover until 10 days after MDMA [568, 569]. After reviewing their data and the literature on MDMA pharmacokinetics, de la Torre and colleagues concluded variation in CYP2D6 genotype is not clinically significant, due in part to the fact that the enzyme is inhibited in most people after administration of an active dose [264]. However, a pooled analysis of 10 clinical studies in healthy volunteers (n=194) examining predictor variables of physiological and psychological response to MDM A found a higher activity of the enzyme CYP2D6 predicted lower MDMA plasma concentrations, after adjusting for dose per body weight [570]. MDMA may produce increased activity of the enzyme CYP1A2, as evidenced by comparing caffeine metabolism before and after MDMA [571]. Findings support the enantioselecti ve nonlinear metabolism of MDMA and its metabolites measured in blood and urine [572-574]. CYP2D6 may be involved in stereoselective metabolism of MDMA, but to a clinically insignificant degree [574]. Comparison of pharmacokinetic -pharmacodynamic relationships for MDMA reveals acute pharmacodynamic tolerance. Despite 7 to 9 hours of half -life of MDMA, and persistent high drug levels in the blood, most pharmacodynamic effects of the initial dose rapidly return to baseline within 4 to 6 hours [557]. A study comparing the effects of a single 100 mg dose with an initial administration of 50 mg followed 2 hours later by 100 mg, a dose regimen similar but not identical to timing between the initial and supplemental dose of MDMA in sponsor -supported trials, reported higher peak plasma MDMA than might be expected and lower levels of the MDMA metabolites HMMA and HMA , but other pharmacodynamic effects were not altered [265]. The initial dose appears to saturate or inhibit the metabolic pathway mediated by CYP2D6, leading a supplemental dose to form metabolites at a lower rate than expected an d increasing exposure to the parent drug (see Figure 2). A study comparing the effects of a single 100 mg dose MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 70 of 253 with an initial administration of 50 mg followed two hours later by 100 mg reported plasma MDMA concentrations increased by more than expected based on dose Cmax +12.8% and AUC +16.2 Cmax -38.2% and AUC -29.8%, which was more than what would be expected based on dose proportionality. These findings are further supported by examining plasma MDMA after two doses of 100 mg given four hours apart [575], plasma MDMA concentrations increased Cmax by Cmax +14.2% and AUC +10.3%, which was also more than would be expected based on dose proportionality, likely due to metabolic autoinhibition of CYP2D6. These findings suggest that intensity of most subjective and physiol ogical effects of MDMA would not be significantly impacted by the supplemental doses in sponsor -supported studies due to acute tolerance to its prototypical effects [575]. This acute tolerance could be caused by functional depletion of stored serotonin that prevent further release despite MDMA still being present [557], or are a result of MDMA transport into intracellular spaces is saturable due to limited transport capacity [106]. Additionally, reversible inhibition of tryptophan hydroxy lase rodents [262], or internalization of serotonin reuptake transporters from the plasma membrane leading to less serotonin release [74], would support self -limiting effects of MDMA. On the other hand, although SERT can be internalized, the evidence suggests that accumulation of extracellular serotonin stimulated by MDMA affects SERT traffickin g by perpetuating cell -surface SERT expression, but in contrast promotes internalization of DAT and NET [106, 576]. 6.2.1.4 Elimination Although the hepatic route is thought to be the major route of metabolism in humans with 50% to 75% of the p arent compound being metabolized, renal clearance accounts for 8% to 11% of elimination of MDMA and its metabolites. After 1.0 mg/kg MDMA HCl, the was urine HMMA After 1.6 mg/kg MDMA HCl, the urine HMMA as the parent compound MDMA. St udies examining metabolism of 100 mg MDMA HCl similar values [253, [563, 582, 583] with some evidence for stereoselective the glucuronide sulfate metabolites [582]. four men mol and 17.7% recovery [581]. By con trast, urinary recovery of the after 40% [584]. Urinary recov ery for MDMA and MDA were higher when a second dose of 100 mg MDMA HCl was administered 24 hours after an initial dose of 100 mg MDMA HCl when compared with a single dose [577]. In one study, urinary excretion of the metabolite HMMA exceeded that of MDMA by 33 hours after a dose of 1.6 mg/kg MDMA HCl [585]. Renal clearance HCl administered were 12.8\u00b15.6 L/h at 75 mg, 20.4 - 12.3 L/h at 100 mg, 13.0\u00b15.4 L/h at 125 mg, and 5.2 -11.3 L/h at 150 mg [18]. Oral clearance (CL/F) by dose of MDMA administered was 0.62\u00b10.19 L/h/kg at 1.0 mg/kg (dose range by weight 43 mg-106 mg) and 0.48\u00b10.11 L/h/kg at 1.6 mg/kg (dose range by weight 69 mg-150 mg) [253]. To date, there are no known clinical trials quantifying excretion of MDMA into breastmilk in humans. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 71 of 253 6.2.1.5 Pharmacogenomics The effects of variation in genotypes for the enzymes CYP2C19, CYP2B6, and CYP1A2 on metabolism of 75 and 125 mg MDMA HCl in a pooled sample of 139 participants found that variants with less functional versions of CYP2C19 70% HMMA. T wo participants with the poor metabolizer variants of CYP2C19 had greater cardiovascular response to MDMA, and tobacco smokers with inducible CYP1A2 exhibited higher conversion of MDMA to MDA [586]. These results demonstrate compensatory mechanisms that involve contributions from multiple enzymes when CYP2D6 is inhibited through a metabolic c omplex with MDMA. A pooled analysis of 10 clinical studies (n=194) examining predictor variables of physiological and psychological response to MDMA in healthy volunteers found a higher activity of the enzyme CYP2D6 predicted lower MDMA plasma concentratio ns, after adjusting for dose per body weight [570]. A pair of in vitro studies modeling metabolism in human liver cells and insect cells reported that CYP2D6 may have functional heterogeneity, or variation in response to substrates, and that less than 50% of CYP2D6 may be inhibited by MDMA, and concluded that the ability of MDMA to inhibit CYP2D6 may be overestimated [587]. The in vitro models seem at odds wit h lingering reduction in activity detected in humans. The enzyme COMT and monoamine oxidase may also be involved in the metabolism of MDMA [584]. At least one variation in COMT genotype may affect MDMA elimination rate (Ke) and systolic (SBP) after MDMA [588]. As a monoamine and oxidase -A [111], combining MDMA with a MAOI medication presents a risk for provoking serotonin syndrome and increases in sympathetic activity. Fatalities have occurred apparently as a result of combining MAOI medications with MDMA [112, 113]. For this reason, MAOI medications are tapered for at least five half -lives of the medication and acti ve metabolites, plus 1 week for symptom stabilization in sponsor - supported studies. An examination of subjective, physiological , and pharmacokinetic effects of variations in genes tied to the serotonin system in a sample of 124 participants sought to inv estigate differences in plasma levels after 125 mg MDMA HCl [589]. While they detected a slight increase in cumulative MDMA levels (AUC) in one variant of the 5 -HT 1A receptor and very slight decrease in Cmax MDMA levels in variant of the 5HT 1B receptor, neither effect w as found to be significant after correcting for number of tests. Variations in genes related to serotonin synthesis and three serotonin 5HT 2A), and SERT made very little difference in vital signs or subjective effects of 125 mg MDMA HCl in a study in 124 healthy controls [589]. Gene variants in the 5HT 2A receptor, SERT, and tryptophan hydroxylase -1 influenced subjective effects, but these effects were no lon ger significant after correcting for number of tests. Pooled analyses of a sample of 132 healthy participants who received 125 mg MDMA HCl in placebo -controlled studies reported that variation in an oxytocin receptor gene (rs1042778TT) reported greater fee lings of trust after MDMA, but that variations in oxytocin receptor genes did not affect cognitive or emotional empathy [590]. 6.2.1.6 Pharmacokinetic Drug Interactions Co-administration studies with MDMA CYP2D6 inhibiting prescription drugs paroxetine [591] and bupropion [592] have been completed. In addition, drug interaction studies with methylphenidate [557] and dextromethorphan [569] have been Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 72 of 253 reversibly inhibits CYP2D6 and decreases CYP3A4 activity, with CYP2D6 function normalizing after 10 days. MDMA increases CYP1A2 activity, as measured by caffeine challenge, by 20% to 40% when CYP2D6 is saturated or inhibited [569]. Due to known MDMA effects of CYP2D6 inhibition, drug interaction studies with CYP2D6 inhibitors are presented in detail below. For additional pharmacokinetic parameters from drug interaction studies , please refer to Appendix Table 22: Highlights of MDMA Clinical Pharmacology and Cardiac Safety . Paroxetine is an SSRI approved for PTSD and patients interested in MDMA -assisted therapy are likely to be on maintenance treatment with this drug. In a randomized, double -blind, crossover, placebo -controlled trial in healthy male volunteers who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (N=7), paroxetine given for 3 days before MDMA resulted in significant increases of MDMA area under the plasma concentration -time curve from 0 to 27 hours (AUC 27) by +23%, AUC from zero to infinity maximum plasma concentration elimination -related pharmacokinetic parameters showed a sign ificant reduction of plasma clearance by -29%, renal clearance by -19%, and hepatic clearance by -32%. Elimination half -life extended from 8.3 to 9.9 hours. A 21% decrease in Cmax of HHMA which is an MDMA metabolite, with no significant differences in AUC 27, AUC , K e and elimination half -life were found. HMMA showed a decrease in plasma concentrations with a reduction in AUC 27 of -28%, AUC of The active MDA , which is produced in the minor metabolic pathway, was shown to have an increase in Cmax of +17% and AUC 27 +16%. Following paroxetine pretreatment, the urinary recovery (0 -45 hours) of the parent compound MDMA increased by 11%; HHMA and HMMA urinary recoveries were 27% and 16% lower, respectively, compared to placebo. The ratio of Cmax values of paroxetine and i ts metabolite on Days 1 and 3 showed a threefold reduction, with no differences in Tmax. As these elevations were not clinically meaningful, the sponsor concludes that drug interactions with previously approved PTSD medications that are also CYP2D6 inhibit ors, such as paroxetine, would be suitable from a safety standpoint for co -administration with MDMA, although some subjective MDMA -induced effects may be reverted attenuated [591]. As is a monoamine reuptake and oxidase -A [111], combining MDMA with a MAOI medication may pres ent a risk for provoking serotonin syndrome and increases in sympathetic activity, as reported in four deaths associated with concomitant use of MDMA and the MAOI moclobemide [112]. However, a recent in vitro study examining the IC 50 of MDMA and MDA against serotonin (24.7 micrometer (\u00b5M) and > \u00b5M, respectively) and dopamine (19.2 \u00b5M and >8.4 \u00b5M, respectively) concluded that inhibitory potential (<20%) was unlikely to be relevant at plasma values observed in humans, which are estimated to be in the range of 1\u00b5M [593]. Bupropion is a norepinephrine dopamine reuptake inhibitor approved for treatment of major depression and smoking cessation, and patients interested in MDMA -assisted therapy may be on maintenance treatment with this drug. Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6 and also competitively inhibits CYP2B6, bupropion . 125 administered after 1 week of bupropion pre-treatment in a double -blind, placebo -controlled, crossover study in 16 healthy volunteers, and -15% (p<0.01), and decreased AUC 24 by - 12% but this failed to reach significance [592]. When results were re -analy zed with stereoselective methods bupropion pre-treatment of R-MDMA by +9% and the AUC from 0 to 24 hours (AUC 24) by +25%. Bupropion pre-treatment increased the Cmax by AUC 24 by In bupropion pre-treatment decreased the of R-MDA -27% by -26%, and the of S-MDA by -24% and the MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 73 of 253 AUC 24 by -20%. Bupropion pre-treatment decreased the Cmax - dependent inactive metabolite stereoisomers by approximately -40%. The changes that were observed in the intermediate metabolizers were comparable to the extensive metabolizers, although the intermediate metaboli zer sample was small (N=3). Although changes in stereoselectivity based on CYP2D6 activity were observed, these are unlikely to have clinical relevance. Bupropion and hydroxy bupropion stereoisomer kinetics were unaltered by MDMA co - administration. As these elevations were not clinically concerning, the sponsor concludes that drug interactions with non -serotonergic medications that are also CYP2D6 inhibitors, such as bupropion , would be suitable from a safety standpoint for with MDMA. 6.2.2 Phar monoamine neurotransmitters , and directly binds or indirectly activates downstream receptors, with actions on the serotonin system likely responsible for most of its subj ective and physiological effects in humans . MDMA is associated with changes in several neurohormones as well with some of these actions likely responsible for some changes in subjective and physiological effects. Typically, human trials have used doses between 1 and 2 mg/kg, with therapeutic studies using fixed dosing rather than adjusting dosing on a mg/kg basis, in order to achieve a more consistent subjective response between individuals. The pharmacokinetics of MDMA in humans have been characte rized in blood and urine samples using oral doses of up to 150 mg MDMA HCl [18]. MDMA is a triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor and similar drugs in this class have been found to exert potent anti -depressant activity with a potentially favor able safety profile [19, 20]. MDMA concomitantly promotes release, inhibits reuptake, and extends duration of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in self -limiting subjective and physiological effects as previously described. In addition to neuroendocrine and norepinephrine -mediated effects, MDMA may target similar binding sites on the SERT, as do already approved PTSD medications P axil and Zoloft, which are both SSRIs. Like the SSRI Prozac, MDMA also inhibits MAO -A to extend presence of serotonin in the synaptic cleft [111]. Pre-treatment or co -administration studies of SSRIs with MDMA suggest that this combination is safe within controlled settings and that it attenuates most effects of MDMA. SSRIs appear to attenuate or eliminate most subjective, physiological and immunological effects of MDMA likely due to competition for binding sites on the SERT, which may prevent transporter -mediated serotonin release [82, 594-597] (see Appendix Table 1: Summary of Investigator -Initiated Trials with MDMA ). Additional effects of each SSRI beyond reuptake inhibition on production, release, and degradation of serotonin are likely responsible for variations between SSRI co -administration findings . The role of serotonin release on the potentially therapeutic effects of MDMA -assisted therapy has yet to be investigated, howe ver reduced feelings of sociability and closeness to others after paroxetine pre -administration suggests that serotonin release is at least partially involved in prosocial effects that are thought to be therapeutically relevant [82]. These subjective effects are predominately mediated by direct or indirect action on 5HT 2A receptors [84, 190, 598] with at least one study concluding that the effects of MDMA upon positive mood are at least due in part to 5HT 2A receptor a ctivation [84]. Findings suggest that the 5HT 1A receptor was partially involved in producing the subjective effects of MDMA [84, 188-190]. A study using receptor -enriched brain mapping of functional connectivity (described in more detail below) reported that changes MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 74 of 253 in functional connectivity in 5HT 2A-receptor enr iched maps were associated with increased reports of having a spiritual experience [599]. Human MDMA studies suggest that norepinephrine release also contributes to the pharmacodynamic, physiological , and psychological effects of MDMA 600, 601], with noradrenergic antagonists attenuating MDMA effects on blood pressure and mood (see Appendix Table 1: Summary of Investigator -Initiated Trials with MDMA ). Most of the psychostimulant -like and prosocial or 'entactogenic' subjective effects of MDMA are blocked after administration of the dual SNRI duloxetine [228, 601], and that these effects may relate to changes in neurohormones such as oxytocin and copeptin. [601, 602]. As the NET unexpectedly has a greater affinity than the DAT for dopami ne, it preferentially clears dopamine in brain areas where there is a greater concentration of NET, such as the frontal cortex [603]. Some MDMA effects on human mood and anxiety may be attributed to dopamine release based on the finding that pretreatment with haloperidol, a dopamine receptor antagonist with partial selectivity for the D2 receptor subtype, diminished MDMA -induced positive mood and increased anxiety, though haloperidol alone was associated with dysphoria [604]. Studies comparing MDMA the dopaminergic and adrenergic drug methylp henidate and bupropion suggest that dopamine release and inhibition of uptake play a minor role, if any, in producing the effects of MDMA [605]. MDMA, but not methylphenidate, increased trust, openness, and closeness to others, and bupropion prolonged the course of subjective effects without reducing or enhancing them [592]. 6.2.2.2 Secondary Pharmacodynamics MDMA produces a neurohormone oxytocin, neurohormone associ ated with trust and affiliation, [81, 606-608], a finding first seen in a naturalistic study that reported elevated levels of oxytocin in clubgoers with detectable blood MDMA levels when compared to clubgoers without detectable levels of MDMA [468], and confirmed in blinded placebo - controlled experiments [81]. However, studies comparing increases in empathy or prosocial effects of MDMA with intranasal oxytocin have failed to find indications that the two substances produce similar effects with MDMA produ cing greater feelings of sociability and emotional empathy than oxytocin [53, 609]. Using pindolol to block 5 -HT1A receptor mediation of oxytocin's effects, Kuypers and colleagues determined that MDMA increased emotional empathy while oxytocin did not produce similar effects on measures of empathy and social interaction [609]. Pooled data across six placebo -controlled within -subjects' studies in 118 participants confirmed an increase in emotional empathy without an inc rease in cognitive empathy [608]. However, interpretation of these results were limited because Kuypers and colleagues [608, 609] did not measure within -subject correlation of subjective effects with mult iple post -MDMA oxytocin levels, as was done by Dumont and colleagues in their clinical trial showing a positive within -subject correlation after MDMA for oxytocin cortisol, prolactin, and adrenocorticotropic hormone concentrations in a dose dependent manner [13, 14, 52, 83, 227, 549, 577, 610-613], whereas growth hormone levels are unchanged by up to 125 mg MDMA HCl [13]. A crossover study comparing the effects methylphenidate found that MDMA increased serum cortisol did not [613]. Increases in cortisol and prolactin pea k at about 2 hours after MDMA administration [13, 549]. A second dose of 100 mg MDMA HCl, given 4 hours after an initial 100 mg, produces a second increase in cortisol during an interval when cortisol levels are declining [614], and a dose of 100 mg MDMA HCl, given 24 hours after an initial dose, MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 75 of 253 stimulates a greater release of cortisol but not prolactin [577]. Doses of 0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg MDMA HCl elevated cortisol, and und er stressful versus less stressful conditions [615]. MDMA may affect levels of other hormones. In a study of the effects of 0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg MDMA HCl in eight people, there was a trend for increased levels of the hormone dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) after 0.5 mg/kg MDMA HCl, and a significant increase after 1.5 mg/kg MDMA HCl, with peak levels appearing 2 to 3 hours post -drug [14]. These findings suggest a relationship between serotonin release and i ncreased serum cortisol. Two that MDMA increased AVP [236, 601]. Neit her study reported analysis or findings concerning any relationship between AVP levels and the subjective, emotional or social effects of MDMA. A study applying a high -throughput detection method using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry to assess cha nges in chemical markers (the \"metabolome\"), after 100 mg MDMA HCl in 16 healthy volunteers, and detected elevation in cortisol, pregnenolone , and calcitriol, a metabolite of vitamin D 4 hours after MDMA [610]. Boxler and colleagues detected a comparable increase of several factors (hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and octadecadienoic acid ) associated with mediating inflammation, and that the authors interpreted as signs of an inflammatory process. A study applying receptor -enriched mapping and function al connectivity in a sample of 20 men reported that 100 mg MDMA HCl activated brain areas assumed to have high 5HT 1A density or high levels of SERT density. Despite failing to find a significant change in functional connectivity after MDMA in brain regions high in 5HT 2A receptors, Dipasquale and colleagues reported that activity seen in these areas after MDMA were associated with reporting a spiritual experience [599]. This investigation also found a relationship between time course of MDMA effects and changes i n functional connectivity in brain areas associated with 5HT 1A receptor density, and reported decreased functional connectivity in several cortical areas, including specific areas of the temporal and frontal cortex, and insula, acutely after MDMA. Another investigation of functional connectivity after administering 100 mg to healthy volunteers reported decreased network connectivity in the right insula/salience network [616] with decreased connectivity associated with changes in subjective ratings of trait anxiety and bodily sensations. 6.2.3 Physiological Effects Physiological effects from published l iterature are reported in the sub -sections below; data derived from MAPS sponsored Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies are included in Section 6.4 Safety of MDMA in Humans . 6.2.3.1 Central Nervous System Early investigations of MDMA in healthy volunteers with PET detected decreased left amygdalar activity and increased frontal activity [617]. Subsequent studies in healthy volunteers have found signs of reduced activity in R amygdala and hippocampus, a decrease in medial prefrontal cortex coupling with the hippoc ampus, and reduced right insular/salience network connectivity [616] (see Appendix Table 1: Summary of Investigator -Initiated Trials with MDMA ). Decreased activity in the amygdala may be indicative of reduced reactions to potential threats [618]. MDMA (100 mg MDMA HCl ) increased subjective ratings of positive mood in response to positive memories and decreased negative response to negative memories. Attenuated activity in the left anterior temporal area was detected after MDMA during worst memory recall [26]. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 76 of 253 During a task that required keeping a visual target cue in mind, visual attention, and response inhibition, brain imaging detected changes in parietal activity after 75 mg MDMA HCl but not with placebo [619]. MDMA increased activity in frontal areas and decreased activity in occipital sites as measured via functional MRI (fMRI) [620]. Reduced resting -state cerebra l blood flow (CBF) in right amygdala and hippocampus after MDMA was associated with greater intensity of self-reported subjective effects [621]. Participants given MDMA exhibited similar brain activity when reading or encoding a word list, which suggests that they were investing similar effort into both tasks. Behavioral Effects MDMA increases positive mood and anxiety [12, 14-16] on measures of alteration in consciousness and subjective effects. People receiving active doses of MDMA defined as 75 to 125 mg MDMA HCl , experience euphoria, positive mood, vigor, and positively experienced derealization, consonant with early r etrospective reports, but also report experiencing anxiety, tension, and dysphoria, as well as concern over losing control over the self [12, 14-16, 554] (see Table 32 and Table 33 for more details ). There is evidence that increases in positive mood and anxiety increased with dose [12, 14, 80, 622]. Healthy controls reported greater interpersonal closeness to others [17, 80-83, 597]. It is uncertain whether the increases in positive and negative mood occurred simultaneously or at different times throughout the duration of MDMA effects; evidence from two different teams suggests that peaks in negative mood may precede peaks in positiv e mood [16, 604]. People have reported feeling anxious or experiencing negative derealization while under the influence of MDMA, inc luding increased anxiety related to loss of control and experiences of racing or blocked thoughts [12, 15, 17]. More information on the effects of MDMA on affect may be found in Section 6.4. 5 Abuse Potential . An examination of personality assessed prior to and after receiving MDMA -assisted therapy from a sponsor -supported study (MP -1) reported increased openness to the experience a ttributable to MDMA when compared with placebo [623], a finding similar to those reported in studies of people give n the classic psychedelic psilocybin [624, 625]. Neuroticism was reduced in both MDMA and placebo groups likely as a function of the accompanying psychotherapy. Wagner and colleagues also found that changes in openness, but not neuroticism, were associat ed with reductions in PTSD symptoms [623]. MDMA may alter detection and receptivity to expressions of em otion. Findings suggest that MDMA might change the way emotional facial expressions might be processed or the response to them. MDMA improved accuracy of recognizing expressions of positive mood and were less accurate in recognizing expressions of negative mood [83], and reduced amygdalar response to angry faces to suggest possibly an altered response to expressions of anger [38]. Despite contradictory findings from a naturalistic study, a controlled trial reported that MDMA imp aired detection of expressions of fear [626]. An fMRI study found that 0.75 and 1.5 mg/kg MDMA HCl reduced signaling in the amygdala in response to angry faces when compared with placebo without changing the response to faces showing fear [38]. MDMA reduced the aversiveness of hearing sounds associated with negative emotions [627]. In addition, and contrary to t he finding in the early naturalistic study described above, there is some evidence that MDMA might produce selective difficulty in recognizing faces expressing fear [53, 557]. At least four research teams published relevant findings in studies of healthy volunteers that examine the effects of MDMA on social cognition with several experimental paradigms assessing brain activity during episodic memory recall and contributions of oxytocin and cortisol to the MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 77 of 253 acute effects of MDMA [38, 616, 620, 628, 629]. Findings include reduced reactivity to simulated social exclusion, reduced negative emotional response to self -selected \"worst\" memories, increased use of language related to interpersonal closeness, increased emotional empathy, and increased perceived partn er empathy (see Appendix Table 1: Summary of Investigator -Initiated Trials with MDMA ). Taken together, this research lends greater support that MDMA possesses unique psychological effects, distinct from psychostimulants that can be beneficial when combined with therapy . MDMA in healthy participants makes social activities more attractive [630], people more generous toward a friend [631], and more willin g to trust a stranger in a \"trust game.\" Rather than increasing trust indiscriminately, trust was given only to trustworthy actors [628]. Studies in healthy controls, comparing doses between 0.75 and 1 mg/kg and 1.5 to 2 mg/kg, suggest that the higher dose produced greater prosocial effects than the lower dose, while the lower dose may have increased self -reported loneliness and use of empathy -related language [28, 29, 632, 633]. In a study by Bedi and colleagues, MDMA induced changes in semantic speech content measured with natural language learning software [27]. Proximity of speech to the concepts of friend, support, intimacy, rapport, and empathy was increased over placebo in the MDMA group, which may bear some significance for the use of MDMA in therapy. MDMA did not affect the overall structure of participant s' speech, and these findings were confirmed in an additional sample using a different method of analysis. The study by Bedi and colleagues reported a greater use of social words and words describing emotions [634]. A systematic examination of statements (discourse) from participants enrolled in MAPS' study MP -1 conducted by an independent researcher found greater attention to and concern for the therapists and others in participants receiving MDMA versus inactive placebo [635]. Sensorimotor Reflex Responses MDMA does not acutely affect responses on tasks requiring attention and response to visual stimuli or visually presented words [17, 617], but has been shown to interfere with performance on digit -symbol substitution - a measure of attention, psychomotor speed and visual memory [12]. A dose of 75 mg improved visual tracking speed, but impaired estimating the position of a blocked (occluded) object in a study of acute effects on skills used for driving cars [636], though without effects on performance monitoring [637]. Subseq uently, a series of studies have thoroughly examined the effects of MDMA on road -tracking and car -following performance in both stimulated and on -the-road driving in normal traffic as part of the Driving Under the Influence of Drugs, alcohol and medicines (DRUID) research consortium funded by a European Union grant. A single -dose of 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, or 100 mg MDMA HCl did not produce any dose- or concentration -related effects on driving performance and was found to be generally safe for driving at thera peutic doses in the absence of sleep loss or alcohol intoxication [638-642]. In one of these studies, driving tests were conducted between 3 and 5 hours after a dose of 75 mg MDMA HCl. Subjects returned the following day for a repetition of the driving tests between 27 and 29 hours post -MDMA. Although changes in cognitive function and psychomotor skills occurred during peak drug effects, these were not detectable on the following day. Acute effects such as excessive caution and impaired positional memory support refraining f rom driving or using heavy machinery [643] during dosing sessions . MDMA causes slight changes in visual or auditory perception, including changes in the brightness or colors, sounds seeming closer or farther away, simple visual distortions [11, 12, 14, 15], and altered time perception [14, 16, 17] Participants also experienced altered time perception and changes in meaning or significance of perceptions after MDMA. There is little indication that MDMA produces any strong alterations to the sense of self or control over the experience [14]. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 78 of 253 Women reported experiencing all subjective effects of M DMA more intensely compared to men, but especially those related to perceptual changes [15, 188, 598]. The effects of MDMA on perception have not been studied in sponsor -supported studies. Body Temperature Grob and colleagues noted that in a Phase 1 safety study MDMA was found to cause a significant increase in body temperature in some healthy volunteers [549]. However, these increases were transient and tolerable in a controlled clinical setting. Studies conducted by other researchers reported that doses between 1.5 and 2 mg/kg MDMA HCl produced a slight elevation in body temperature that was not clinically significant [15, 232, 595, 598] and this elevation was unaffected by ambient temperature [215]. Further, 2 mg/kg produced a slight but statistically significant increases in core body temperature with a mean elevation of 0.6\u00b0C, at cool (18\u00b0C) and warm (30\u00b0C) ambient temperatures [215]. A supplemental dose twice as large as the initial dose of MDMA elevated body temperature, but not beyo nd what was expected after the cumulative dose [265]. Thermog enic effects of MDMA are distinct from malignant hyperthermia and mediated by noradrenergic signaling, which contributes to peripheral effects of MDMA by affecting cutaneous vasoconstriction of blood flow and stimulation of heat production and attenuated b y norepinephrine blocking drugs. Research participants in clinical trials do not engage in vigorous exercise and either sit or lie down throughout duration of drug effects. It may be the case that heat dissipation impaired by a hot environment, heat genera tion increased by exertion, interactions of serotonergic drugs, and potential disturbance of central heat regulation mechanisms contribute to the occurrence of hyperpyrexia (body temperatures >41\u00b0C) in people ingesting Ecstasy in uncontrolled settings. When compared with placebo, findings from 74 people that were given MDMA in oral doses ranging from 70 -150 mg MDMA HCl (1.35 -1.8 mg/kg) found that men exhibited a greater elevation in body temperature than women when given the dose of MDMA in mg/kg [15]. Subsequent studies have not confirmed this sex difference [38, 570]. A report in a sample of 17 men and women reported higher oral temperatures in women [588]. Prior to correction for number of tests, a study on the effects of serotonin -related genotypes on MDMA reported higher body temperature in people with a variant of the TPH -2 gene, but these findings were no longer significant after applying corrections [589]. A review of clinical placebo -controlled laboratory studies conducted without sponsor support found that route of measurement influences variability in body temperature fi ndings, with oral and tympanic, but not axillary, temperatures frequently rising above 38\u00b0C into moderate hyperthermia ranges at 125 mg MDMA HCl. 6.2.3.2 Cardiovascular System MDMA produces sympathomimetic effects that include elevation in blood pressure and hea rt rate, first recorded by Downing [36] and replicated by other research teams in the U.S. and Europe [11, 13-15, 37-39, 232]. MDMA has also been found t o decrease respiratory sinus arrhythmia, the natural variation in heart rate over the course of each respiratory cycle [644]. Cardiovascular effects of MDMA typically first appear 30 to 45 minutes after administration [36], peak between 1 - and 2 -hours post -drug [16, 37], and wane 3 to 5 hours after drug administration. Men given the same mg/kg dose of MDMA as women exhibited a significantly greater elevation in blood pressure and heart rate in a study summarizing and pooling data from a series of human MDMA studies [15]. These studies did not report any discomfort or increased distress accompanying cardiovascular effect s. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 79 of 253 Elevation in blood pressure above 140/90 mmHg occurred in approximately 5% of research participants receiving a single dose of at least 100 mg MDMA HCl in Phase 1 research studies [13, 17]. Peiro and colleagues observed elevation in blood pressure above 150/90 mmHg as well as in all 10 participants given 50 mg followed by 100 mg MDMA HCl 2 hours later [265](see Appendix Table 1: Summary of Investigator -Initiated Trials with MDMA ). When compared with 100 mg MDMA HCl and placebo given 4 hours apart, two doses of 100 mg 4 hours apart significantly elevated SBP, while other physiological effects were not significantl y elevated beyond values seen after a single dose. None of these individuals needed clinical intervention and blood pressure returned to normal as drug effects waned [13, 17, 265]. Of relevance, in an investigator -initiated safety and tolerability proof -of-concept study of MDMA -assisted therapy for treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD) post -detoxification [645], the investigators report that one participant with controlled hypertension experienced a transient abnormal rise in blood pressure (SBP/DBP of 183/118 mmHG) two hours after initial dose of 125 mg MDMA HCl, attributed to the participa nt forgetting to take their hypertensive medication. The supplemental dose was withheld and the participant was asymptomatic with no medical intervention needed. The participant took their hypertensive medication prior to the subsequent second dosing sessi on and did not experience abnormal changes in blood pressure. This independent report supports the sponsor's mitigation strategy of maintaining participants on hypertensive medication during MDMA -assisted therapy treatment. The 1 - and beta -adrenergic r eceptor antagonist carvedilol is capable of reducing MDMA - induced elevations in blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature when administered 1 hour before MDMA without affecting the subjective effects of MDMA, indicating the norepinephrine release is primarily responsible for cardiovascular effects of MDMA [227]. Other concomitant antihypertensive medications either alter some of the effects of MDMA [626] or do not significantly reduce MDMA -induced blood pressure elevation [225]. 6.2.3.3 Hepatic System and Other Laboratory Values An examination of liver function as assessed approximately 1 month after MDMA administration in 166 participants, most of them MDMA -na\u00efve, failed to detect any post -drug changes [232]. The first two sponsor -supported Phase 2 studies (MP -1, MP -2) assessed liver function after completion of two or three blinded dosing sessions . Values that differ from established age - appropriate norms were evaluated for clinical signi ficance. Laboratory assessments of liver function were not conducted after dosing sessions in subsequent sponsor -supported studies and no AEs related to liver function have been reported in these studies. Table 8: List of All Abnormal Clinically Significant Changes in Laboratory Values in Two Participants from MP -2 Laboratory Value Abnormal Test Value Value at Baseline Normal Value/Range MDMA HCl Dose Bilirubin 2.8 2.2 <2.5 mg/dL 125 mg ESR 32 2.4 <10 mm 125 mg Two participants in the MP-2 study reported two clinically significant abnormal laboratory values . One was an elevation in bilirubin in a subject with a family history of elevated bilirubin (probably Gilbert's syndrome), a benign liver condition in which the liver does not proper ly process bilirubin, with the elevation occurring after open -label treatment with an initial dose of 125 mg to 150 mg MDMA HCl . Family history of mildly elevated bilirubin is considered an indicator of Gilbert's syndrome. Bilirubin levels can be indicativ e of decreased liver function, but the liver enzymes were normal at that time, supporting the interpretation that the bilirubin levels MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 80 of 253 were slightly elevated compared to baseline due to hereditary factors. The other abnormal laboratory value, an elevation in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), a marker of inflammation and not a specific liver function marker, occurred in a subject with a medical history of breast cancer. This value was recorded 3 months after the last administration of MDMA as an unrelate d AE. Table 9: Average ALT Values at Baseline and 2 -Month Follow -up After Two Dosing Sessions in Participants from MP -1 Timepoint Placebo MDMA (125 Endpoint N=8 19.7 (12.7) N=13 a Post-drug liver panels or other laboratory tests were not conducted in studies subsequent to studies MP -1 and MP -2. No clinically significant changes in liver function occurred in MP -1. Values for laboratory tests were within the normal range in MP -1. Phase 1 studies conducted outside of sponsor support involving administration of MDMA to healthy volunteers have not published any results of liver function after MDMA administration. There have been no reported adverse effects on the liver from these studie s. 6.2.3.4 Renal System Cardiovascular Effects as correlating with AVP in blood, was detected in women acutely after 125 mg MDMA HCl administration [601], and this finding was reproduced in another study reporting that 47.5 mg MDMA HCl caused an acute rise in AVP and a small decrease in plasma sodium, at a time of day when it would not be expected to change, in an all -male sample. [236]. Norepinephrine release induced by MDMA leads to indirect activation of the AVP system, likely stimulating secretion of copeptin ( CTproAVP), a 39 -aminoacid glycopeptide that is a C -terminal part of the precursor to pre -proAVP that directly affects AVP. Heart failure is commonly associated with hyponatremia and is also characterized by increased concentrations of basal AVP and CTproAV P in humans [471]. Intra -cardiac intra -arterial pressures , angiotensin II, pain, and adrenergic (2) central nervous stimuli can also influence AVP secretion [459]. Increased CTproAVP concentration was described in several studies as a strong predictor of mortality in patients with chronic heart failure and acute heart failure. [460]. 6.2.3.5 Immune System Various groups h ave studied immunological effects of MDMA in laboratory settings and studies in men conducted by researchers in Spain have found 100 mg MDMA HCl to have immunosuppressive and anti -inflammatory effects [596, 614, 646-648]. Findings included a decline in C D4 cells, smaller CD4/CD8 ratio, attenuated lymphocyte proliferation in response to mitogen, and an increase in natural killer (NK) cells, with effects diminishing but still detectable 24 hours after drug administration. These researchers also found that M DMA decreased production of pro -inflammatory cytokines ( see Appendix Table 1: Summary of Investigator - Initiated Trials with MDMA ). Generally, MDMA appeared to decrease the concentration of Th1 cytokines, including IL -2, and increase the amount of Th2 cytokines, including IL -4, measured in blood. Changes of similar magnitude and duration have been previously noted after ingestion of other psychoactive agents such as alcohol or cocaine [647, 648]. Interestingly, meta -analysis and meta -regression of 20 studies investigating inflammatory markers in PTSD found an association MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 81 of 253 with increased IL -6, IL -1 , TNF - , and INF - , consistent with chronic low -grade inflammation [276] Any effects of MDMA on these immune markers remain to be tested. Immunological changes seen after an initial dose of MDMA were enhanced by a second dose of identical size given 4 or 24 hours after the initial dose [614, 649]. Given these data, it is possible that administering a smaller supp lemental dose 1.5 to 2.5 hours after the first dose could slightly enhance the immunological effects set in motion by the initial dose of MDMA. To date, the clinical significance of these immunological findings have not been established and no reports of an increase in infections related to MDMA administration have been found in PTSD studies. 6.2.3.6 Reproductive System Human data on effects of MDMA during pregnancy is limited. Several epidemiological survey studies have attempted to study this issue and found mixed results [650-652]. A 2012 survey of 96 women in the UK interviewed about their drug use during p regnancy found a link between self-reported extent of prenatal Ecstasy exposure and delays in infant development at 12 months, with heavily exposed infants delayed in mental and motor development, but not language or emotional development [653]. These results were repeated in a 2016 survey of 96 mothers who reported heavier Ecstasy use (1.3\u00b11.4 tablets per week) during pregnancy. Infants had motor delays from 4 months to 2 years of age that were not attributable to other drug or lifestyle factors [654]. There is no suspicion of human teratogenicity or da ta that supports genotoxic potential, and non-clinical reproductive toxicity studies of relevance for early human pregnancy have been completed and demonstrated results that do not generate strong suspicion of human teratogenicity/fetotoxicity. 6.2.3.7 Cognition and Performance Research has assessed acute effects of MDMA on perception and cognition acutely after MDMA, commonly at doses between 75 and 125 mg MDMA HCl (or 0.5 to 1.5 mg/kg). In these studies, acute subjective effects peaked 90 to 120 minutes after o ral administration and returned to pre - drug levels 3 to 6 hours later [17, 633, 636]. Sub -acute effects assessed in controlled and naturalistic studies occurred 1 to 3 days after drug administrati on but were no longer apparent 7 to 14 days later [14, 545, 655]. A study of variations in serotonin -related genes across a pooled sample reported that people with a variant of the 5HT 2A gene reported experiencing more \"good drug effect,\" \"trust,\" \"high mood,\" and \"dreaminess,\" and people with a variant in the 5HT 1A gene reported a higher \"good drug effect,\" \"closeness to others\", and lower ratings of a \"bad drug effect\" [589]. People with a variant of the SERT gene reported greater \"fear\" and 'depression\" after MDMA. A second dose of MDMA 2 hours after the first did not increase su bjective effects beyond that of an initial dose, which was interpreted by Peiro and colleagues as an indication of tolerance to these effects [265]. When two 100 mg doses were given 4 hours apart, most subjective effects were comparable to those after a single dose, despite double the amount of plasma MDMA [575]. It is notable that the second dose in this study was identical to the first dose, in contrast to sponsor -supported studies, wh erein the second dose was half the size of the initial dose. See Section 6.2.3 Physiologica l Effects for further details on subjective effects. Earlier f indings from a pooled set of drug -na\u00efve participants reported differences in intensity of subjective effects with women reporting greater intensity of all subjective effects, and especially perceptual effects [15]. However, t he same researchers performed a larger pooled analysis 10 MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 82 of 253 clinical studies (n=194) examin ing predictor variables of physiological and psychological response to MDMA in healthy volunteers , reporting that after adjusting for body weight, sex was no longer pr edictive for plasma concentration or subjective effects [570]. Using univariable analysis, after adjusting for dose per body weight, the study reported participants with higher scores on the personality trait \"openness to experience,\" predicted more perceived \"closeness,\" a stronger decrease in \"general inactivation,\" and higher scores in feelings of \"oceanic boundlessness\" and \"visionary restructuralization\", while participants with higher scores on the personality trait \"neuroticism\" or \"trait anxie ty\" were more likely to have unpleasant or anxious reactions. Separate analys es of pooled samples also failed to support these sex effects [554]. An analysis of changes in PTSD symptom severity and changes in personality trait s \"openness\" and \"neuroticism\" following MDMA -assisted therapy, found a significant increase in openness in the MDMA -assisted therapy group compared to the placebo with t herapy group [656]. Openness, but not neuroticism, moderated the relationship between MDMA treatment and reduction in PTSD symptoms indicating openness may be a potential mechanism of therapeutic change . As the personality trait \"openness to experience\" was reported as a predictor variable of a positive MDMA experience [570], the authors suggest that these findings support a multi -dosing sessio n treatment model . As participants are more likely to become more open to the experience following each session , participants with PTSD may b e more likely to derive greater benefit from subsequent dosing sessions , which justifies a 3 -session MDMA treatment package . The effects of MDMA on perception have not been studied within sponsor -supported studies. The perceptual effects of MDMA appear to be the result of direct or indirect action on 5HT 2A receptors; co -administration of the 5HT 2A antagonist ketanserin reduced reported perceptual alterations, as well as eliminated slight elevations in body temperature after 1.5 mg/kg MDMA HCl pindolol did not affect perceptual alteration [188]. 6.3 Efficacy of MDMA Across Populations 6.3.1 PTSD When combined with therapy , MDMA permits people to confront and consider emotionally intense memories, thoughts, or feelings, and perhaps through changes in mood and perception, increase empathy and compassion for others and oneself [41, 51, 78]. In a sub -study of MP -8, the Self Compass ion Scale [657] was administered before and 2 months after MDMA -assisted therapy . Preliminary results in this small sub -study (N=7) were promising; participants were low in self -compassion with a mean total score of 2.4\u00b10.63 prior to the study and experienced an increase to moderate self -compassion with a mean total score of 2.8\u00b10.84. In this assessment, self-kindness and a sense of common humanity increased, while self -judgment and feelings of isolation decreased on average within -subjects. Phase 2 Efficacy Data Completed sponsor -supported Phase 2 studies of MDMA -assisted therapies employed recognized clinician -administered gold -standard measures of the condition or symptoms. The primary outcome measure of efficacy in the first six Phase 2 studies of MDMA -assisted therapy was the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS -IV) following DSM -IV, an established semi - structured interview conducted by a trained clinician [658-660]. The Total Severity CAPS -IV score encompasses frequency and intensity scores for three symptom domains: re -experiencing, avoidance , and hyperarousal. An Independent Rater that does not see the participants during any of the therapy sessions administers the CAPS -IV at the Baseline Visit and at the Primary MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 83 of 253 Endpoint (1 or 2 months after blinded MDMA -assisted therapy sessions). Secondary endpoints include an assessment 1 to 2 months after a third dosing session and 12 months afte r the last treatment. Figure 3 below show s pooled mean Total Severity CAPS -IV scores for sponsor -supported studies (MP-1, MP -2, MP -4, MP -8, MP -9, MP -12), as reported in a comparison of active dose (75 mg to 125 mg MDMA HCl ) versus placebo dose (40 mg MDMA HCl ) at Primary Endpoint, 1 to 2 months after a second dosing session and 1 to 2 months after the third dosing session (End of Stage 1) [31]. Despite slight differences in study designs, including length of time post second dosing session to outcome assessment ( 3 to 8 weeks), and language of the CAPS (English or translated), these results demonstrate reproducibility and generalizability across multiple international studies of MDMA -assisted therapy in the treatment of chronic PTSD. Placebo and comparator groups cross over to St age 2 after the Primary Endpoint; therefore, CAPS was not administered at the End of Stage 1 for these groups. Active dose groups (100 mg and 125 mg MDMA HCl ) do not crossover, hence no data for Stage 2 endpoints. Figure 3: Least Squares Mean Estimates of Change in CAPS -IV from Baseline to Post 3rd Dosing Session Across studies, CAPS -IV scores are downward trending at the Primary Endpoint, after two dosing sessions of MDMA -assisted therapy . Primary endpoint results after a ctive initial doses of 75 mg to 125 mg MDMA HCl , with an optional supplemental half -dose administered 1.5 to 2.5 hours later, appear lower than placebo or comparator dose results after two dosing sessions . Two - month follow -up results at the End of Stage 1 after a blinded or open -label third dosing session demonstrate further mean decreases in CAPS score. Across studies, CAPS -IV scores trended downward at the Secondary Endpoint after two open - label dosing sessions of MDMA -assisted therapy , consistent with S tage 1 results. Secondary endpoint results in the crossover set receiving an active dose of 100 mg to 125 mg MDMA HCl) MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 84 of 253 after receiving comparator dose or placebo in Stage 1 are in range with participants receiving active doses in Stage 1. At treatment exit (the end of Stage 1 or 2, final assessment), CAPS -IV severity scores dropped 44.8 points (SD 2.82), Cohen's d effect size of 1.58 [33]. Symptom severity remained essentially the same as treatment exit when assessed at least 12 months later, with scores dropping 5.2 more points, indicating an enduring reduction in symptoms after MDMA -assisted therapy (Figure 4 ). The number of participants who no longer met PTSD criteria increased from treatment exit (56.0%) to long -term follow -up (67.0%) [33]. However, the lack of a control group at 12 -month follow -up limited t he interpretation of these results and warrants further investigation. Figure 4: Least Squares Mean Change in CAPS -IV from Baseline to Long -Term Follow -Up Subsequent to completing these studies, the sponsor assessed PTSD symptoms with the CAPS -5, designed to c apture the diagnostic criteria for PTSD found in the DSM -5. Like the CAPS -IV, the updated CAPS -5 is a structured interview, administered by a central blinded Independent Rater who has not been present during any therapy sessions. CAPS -5 total severity scor es range from 0 to 80 [661]. CAPS -5 was employed in completed Phase 2 studies MPVA -1, MP16 and MP17 , for the completed Phase 3 study MAPP1, and for future planned studies of MDMA -assisted therapy in people with PTSD. -60-50-40-30-20-100 Baseline Treatment Exit Long-term Follow-upLeast Squares Mean (SE) Change in CAPS-IV Total Scores from Baseline MDMA 75-125 mg *** *MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 85 of 253 Phase 3 Efficacy Data Efficacy data from the pivotal Phase 3 study, MAPP1 , were positive and support the conclusions of the Phase 2 studies . MDMA as an adjunct to s upportive therapy was statistically superior for PTSD treatment in CAPS -5 severity scores from Baseline to Primary Endpoint, 8 weeks after three blinded dosing sessions, in comparison to therapy paired with an inactive placebo (p<0.0001, d=0.91) [30]. The pooled mean Total Severity CAPS -5 scores for MAPP 1 are shown in Figure 5, as reported in a comparison of MDMA -assisted the rapy versus placebo with therapy groups at Baseline (T1); three weeks after dosing session 1 (T2); three weeks after dosing session 1 (T3); and Primary Endpoint, eight weeks after dosing session 3 (T4).

MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 86 of 253 Responder analysis indicated that at the primary endpoint, 88% of participants in the MDMA -AT group had a clinically significant improvement, defined as a 10 -point decrease on CAPS -5, compared to 62% of the placebo group . Additionally, 67% of participants in the MDMA -AT group no longer met diagnostic criteria for PTSD, compared to 32% of the placebo group, and 33% of participants in the MDMA -AT group were considered in remission, with a CAPS -5 Total Severity Score less than 11 and Loss o f PTSD Diagnosis , compared to 5% of the placebo group, see Figure 6 . Figure 6: Treatment Response and Remission for Treatment Groups Withdrawal is defined as a post -randomization early termination; Non -responders did not show clinically significant improvement, defined as a <10 -point decrease on CAPS -5; Responders showed clinically significant improvement, defined as a 10 -point decrease on CAPS -5; Loss of diagnosis is defined by specific diagnostic measure on CAPS -5; and Remission is defined as a loss of diagnosis and a total CAPS -5 score of 11 . Reproduced from Nature Medicine [30]. A long -term follow -up study among Phase 3 participants who were randomized to receive MDMA or placebo w ith therapy in the parent study is ongoing in order to assess the durability of these results. These findings will be reported when completed. 6.3.2 Social Anxiety in Autistic Adults The primary outcome measure for the study of social anxiety in people on the a utism spectrum is the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS). This observer -blind measure is an established clinician -administered measure of social anxiety, assessing fear and avoidance in different situations. The LSAS consists of 24 items, with each item rated on a four -point scale (from 0 to 3), with subscales for performance fear, performance avoidance, social fear, and social avoidance. 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100% Post 1 session Post 2 sessions Post 3 sessions% of participants RemissionLoss of DiagnosisResponders Non-RespondersWithdrawalsMDMA-assisted therapyTreatment 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100%% of participants RemissionLoss of DiagnosisResponders Non-RespondersPost 1 session Post 2 sessions Post 3 sessionsPlacebo with therapy WithdrawalsMAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 87 of 253 Data was analyzed and findings appear in the following publication [89]. Improvement in LSAS scores from the Baseline Visit to the Primary Endpoint was significantly greater for MDMA group compared to the placebo group (P=0.037), and placebo -subtracted Cohen's d effect s ize was very large (d=1.4, CI: -0.074, 2.874). Change in LSAS scores from the Baseline Visit to 6 - month follow -up showed similar positive results (P=0.036), with a Cohen's d effect size of 1.1 (CI: -0.307, 2.527). The study safety and efficacy data were pu blished [89]. 6.3.3 Anxiety Associated with Life -Threatening Illness MAPS is studying the effects of MDMA -assisted therapy on people experiencing anxiety as they face a potentially life -threat ening illness. A manuscript containing results was published in Scientific Reports in November 2020. Participants with anxiety from life -threatening illnesses were randomized to receive MDMA (125 mg MDMA HCl ) or placebo in combination with two eight -hour t herapy sessions. At the primary endpoint, the MDMA group had a greater mean (SD) reduction in State -Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) Trait scores , -23.5 ( SD:12.3), indicating less anxiety, compared to the placebo group, -8.8 (SD:14.7); however, the group difference was not statistically significant [90]. 6.3.4 Alcohol Use Disorder An investigator -initiated trial investigated the safety and tolerability proof -of-concept of MDMA - assisted therapy for treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD) post -detoxification in an open -label study [645]. Participants with AUD (N=14) , post -detoxification, completed a ten-session course of recovery -based therapy over eigh t week s that included two sessions where participants received an initial dose of 125 mg MDMA HCl followed by a supplementary dose of 62.5 mg MDMA HCl in combination with eight -hour therapy sessions. There were no new safety signals reported or unexpected AEs observed. The mean units of alcohol consumption decreased from 130.6 units per week prior to detoxification to 18.7 units per week nine months post - detoxification, indicating a change in drinking behavior. These findings provide initial support for the safety and tolerability of MDMA -assisted therapy for treatment of AUD post -detoxification. 6.4 Safety of MDMA in Humans All sponsor -supported safety data (adverse events, spontaneously reported reactions, vitals during dosing sessions , and suicidal ideation and behavior) are presented in this IB through a cutoff date of October 01, 2021 unless indicated otherwise. For more information on completed, ongoing and planned sponsor ed studies, please see Table 4 and Table 5 . Safety was addressed and closely monitored through several measures in these studies. Vital signs, concomitant medications, unexpected , and expected AEs were collected in all studies. Suicidal ideation and behavior were form ally measured with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) in all but the MP-1 and MP -2 studies . Three completed studies (MP -1, MP-12, MP -4) measured cognitive function before and after treatment. Psychological distress during therapy sessions was assessed in most Phase 2 studies with the single -item Subjective Units of Distress (SUD) scale. Partial safety data from the Phase 1 study MT -1 in healthy volunteers are not presented in the current report since the data remain blinded. No medical in tervention has been required for AEs during this study to date. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 88 of 253 The most common reactions pooled across Phase 2 studies in which these reactions were collected were transient and decreased over time , as the drug was metabolized during treatment sessions and excreted over the next 24 hours with the majority of reactions resolving within several days and up to 1 week after dosing . Overall, across treatment groups, the most frequently reported spontaneous reaction s or adverse events were anxiety, headache, and fatigue . In the active MDMA dose groups, participants reported spontaneously reported reactions including dry mouth, diarrhea, heavy legs, impaired judgment, and nystagmu s; none were reported as severe and all had resolved by day 7 following the dosing session . The most frequently reported severe reaction s in these Phase 2 studies were anxiety, nausea, insomnia, and tight jaw (see Table 10 -13 and Appendix Tables 17-21). In the active MDMA dose groups, 10% of participants reported the following reactions had not resolve d 7 days following the dosing session : anxiety, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, increased irritability, insomnia, and low mood . In the Phase 3 study MAPP1, the most common adverse events occurring 2x more frequently in the MDMA -assisted therapy versus the placebo with therapy arm were muscle tightness (63.0% MDMA, vs 11.4% placebo), decreased 0% placebo), feeling jittery (10.9% MDMA, vs 0% placebo), non - cardiac chest pain MDMA, vs 2.3% placebo) , dry 0% placebo). The half -life of MDMA doses used in these studies was 7 to 9 hours and the majority of AEs have been transient, resolving within 2 to 3 days after MDMA had been metabolized and excreted. The observed reactions in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies also overlapped with symptoms of pre -existing conditions in medical history associated with PTSD (depression, somatic symptoms, insomnia, anxiety), which might have influence d the frequency of events observed during clinical trials of MDMA -assisted therapy . 6.4.1 Adverse Events 6.4.1.1 Commonly Reported Reactions from Early Phase Studies Common AEs of MDMA reported in non -sponsor supported Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers include elevation in blood pressure a nd heart rate, increased anxiety or dysphoria, and dilated pupils [12-15]. Some reports indicated decreased rather than increased alertness [12]. Other common AEs reported in controlled studies of MDMA include reduced appetite, dizziness, tight jaw, bruxism (tooth -grinding), disturbance in attention, impaired gait or balance, dry mouth, and thirst. Participants in some studies also reported or exh ibited changes in cognition, such as increases in speed of thought or thought blocking, facilitated imagination or recall [17], and unusual thoughts or ideas [14]. Other les s commonly reported events include paraesthesia (unusual body sensations) such as tingling or feeling hot or cold. MDMA can produce anxiety in healthy volunteers [14, 15, 17]. These effects are transient and recede as drug effects wane. One MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 89 of 253 study found that women were more likely to report these events than men [15], while another study failed to support sex differences in reporting AEs [554]. 6.4.1.2 Spontaneously Reported Reactions from Early Phase Studies The most commonly reported AEs from Phase 1 studies published between 1986 and 2012 were used to develop a list of common adverse reactions to MDMA, or Spontaneously Reported Reactions, to record daily occurrence, duration and severity [14, 17, 36, 51, 78, 225, 228, 594, 598, 600, 604, 617]. Based on the reports, 24 reactions were identified to be tracked during sponsor -supported studies MP -1 and MP -2, and three were added after examining data from t he first sponsor -supported study in a PTSD sample (MP -1). The investigators noted that participants in MP -1 reported greater incidence of diarrhea and muscle tightness, which were added to the list, and further observation led to the addition of impaired j udgment. Based on the half -life of active MDMA doses being 7 to 9 hours, it was most important to collect reactions on the day of drug administration and the following 7 days after each dosing session . The subset of AEs referred to as spontaneously reporte d reactions included: anxiety, depressed mood, insomnia, obsessive rumination, restlessness, irritability, headache, disturbance in attention, dizziness, parasthesia, judgment impaired, hypersomnia, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, asthenia, feeling cold, muscle tension, decreased appetite, hyperhidrosis, disturbed gait, dry mouth, thirst, sensation of heaviness, somnolence, and nystagmus. In sponsor -supported Phase 2 studies, researchers recorded any spontaneous (unsolicited) reports of common reactions on the day of each dosing session and 7 days after. The same severity coding system for AEs was employed throughout all studies, based on l imitation in daily function. Table 10 and Table 11 below display data from studies investigating MDMA -assisted therapy for PTSD (MP -1, MP -2, MP -4, MP -8, MP -9 and MP -12), social anxiety in autistic adults (MAA -1) (see Appendix Tables 17 ), and anxiety associated with life -threatening illness (MDA -1) (see Appendix Table 18 and Appendix Table 19 ). For all clinical studies conducted after MP-12, adverse events were collected following enrollment and spontaneously reported reactions were not collected. Spontaneous Reactions in Phase 2 PTSD Studies In Table 10 , the relative in cidence of spontaneously reported reactions (SRR), which occurred during dosing sessions , are summarized for studies MP -1, MP -2, MP -4, MP -8, MP -9, and MP -12 (N=105). SRR's were collected with AEs in MP16, MP17, and Phase 3 trials. In the placebo group (N=1 0), participants most frequently reported anxiety (n=9), insomnia (n=9), headache (n=8), and fatigue; severe SRRs included anxiety. (n=7). In subjects who received blinded 25 mg to 40 mg MDMA HCl (N=21), most frequently reported SRRs included headache (n=14), (n=11), anxiety (n=8), and muscle tension (n=7); severe SRRs included anxiety (n=1), insomnia (n=1), lack of appetite (n=1), and needing more sleep (n=1). In subjects who received bli nded 75 mg to 125 mg MDMA HCl (N=74), frequently reported SRRs included anxiety (n=52), tight jaw (n=46), headache (n=38), fatigue (n=36), and lack of appetite (n=35); severe SRRs included anxiety (n=5), nausea (n=4), (n=1), low mood (n=1), and restlessness (n=1). Similarly, in participants who received open -label 100 mg to 150 mg MDMA HCl) (N=78), the most frequently reported SRRs were tight jaw (n=47), anxiety (n=38), lack of appetite (n=38), headache (n=35), and fatigue (n=33); and severe SRRs included anxiety (n=8), insomnia (n=5), (n=3), headache nausea irritability (n=1), lack of sensitivi ty to cold (n=1). MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 90 of 253 Overall, across placebo and active dose treatment groups, the most frequently reported SRRs were anxiety, headache, and fatigue. There were several SRRs that were not reported in the placebo group but were reported in either the active blinded 75 mg to 125 mg MDMA HCl or open -label 100 mg to 150 mg MDMA HCl groups: dry mouth, diarrhea, heavy legs, impaired judgement, and nystagmus; none of which were reported as severe. All of these SRRs were resolved by 7 -day follow -up after the dosing sessions (Table 10). For other SRRs, in the active MDMA dose groups, those that were not resolved by 7 -day follow -up after dosing sessions in 10% of participants included anxiety (25.7% blinded, blinded only), increased irritability (10.8% blinded only), insomnia (10.8% blinded only), and low mood (17.6% blinded only). The placebo group had significantly fewer participants which limits direc t comparison against the active MDMA dose groups. Nonetheless, in a total of 10 participants, a large proportion of the placebo sample also reported anxiety, fatigue, and insomnia at 7 -day follow -up. The remaining SRRs that were unresolved at 7 -day follow -up that could have been linked to active MDMA were difficulty concentrating, increased irritability, and low mood. Studies with larger and more balanced sample sizes are needed to make direct comparisons against placebo vs. active dose MDMA groups to eluci date whether SRRs had occurred during and/ or after dosing sessions . In the meantime, clinical actions are taken to closely monitor all unresolved SRRs throughout the treatment period and later assessed at long -term follow -up.

B Diarrhea, impaired judgment, and muscle tension were added based on observations from early studies to reactions list. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 96 of 253 In the Phase 1/Phase 2 study MPVA -1, among six dyads consisting of one participant diagnosed with PTSD, along with their concerned significant others (CSO), the most common spontaneously reported reactions during open -label dosing sessions were lack of app jaw (50.0% PTSD and 66.7% CSO participants). During the 7 days following open -label dosing sessions , at least half of either PTSD or CSO participants reported fatigue (up to 100.0%), headache (up to 83.3%), lack of appetite (up to 83.3%), anxiety (up to 66.7%), insomnia (up to 66.7%), and nausea (up to 50.0%). Fatigue (50.0%) was the most commonly report ed reaction that lasted to Day 7 but only among participants with PTSD. Anxiety (33.3%), lack of appetite (33.3%), and nausea (33.3%) were also reported on Day 7, and again, only among participants with PTSD. Overall, few participants reported any reaction s later in the week, which suggests most reactions were short -term and self - limiting. In summary, in Phase 2 trials most reactions were not long -lasting in PTSD studies, nor did they warrant cause for clinical concern. Elevations in anxiety and poor slee p were managed across dose groups with short -acting low dose benzodiazepine, or sleep aids as needed, per clinical judgment of the study physician. SRRs were typically observed during drug administration and most were transient and diminished as the drug w as metabolized and excreted over a period of 24 hours with the majority of reactions resolving within several days and up to 1 week after dosing. Given the benign safety profile and positive efficacy signal, the sponsor concluded that the risk - benefit anal ysis of MDMA -assisted therapy for treatment of PTSD weighs in favor of continuation of the Clinical Development Program for this treatment. Spontaneous Reactions in Anxiety Associated with Life -threatening Illness Spontaneously reported reactions were collected in a sample of 18 participants in MAPS' Phase 2 study MDA -1 during blinded and open -label sessions with inactive placebo or an active dose of 125 mg MDMA HCl and a supplemental half -dose. Prevalence of reacti ons is displayed based on number of participants reporting the reaction at least onc e (Appendix Table 18). The most commonly reported reactions for the active dose groups were tight jaw /jaw clenching (84.6% in 125 mg blinded sessions versus 20.0% in inactive placebo sessions), thirst (84.6% in 125 mg blinded sessions versus 40.0% in inactive placebo sessions), perspiration (69.2% in 125 mg sessions versus none in placebo sessions, dry mo uth (69.2% in 125 mg blinded sessions versus 20.0% in inactive placebo sessions), and headache (61.5% in 125 mg MDMA versus 20.0% placebo). The only severely rated reaction for participants in MDA -1 was a single report of diarrhea recorded during the secon d day of contact (Day 2) in the 125 mg open -label Stage 2 , which was assumed to be related . Due to temporal proximity to dosing, relationship to drug cannot be ruled out. Owing to the very small sample size, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions concern ing frequency of spontaneously reported reactions in this sample. Comparing blinded session active dose with placebo controls during the 7 -day safety window (Appendix Table 19 ), the most commonly reported reactions were fatigue (u p to 92.3% in active dose versus 40.0% for inactive placebo), insomnia (up to 46.2% in active dose versus 40.0% in inactive placebo), need more sleep (up to 46.2% in active dose versus 20.0% of inactive placebo), and drowsiness (up to 30.8% in active dose versus 20.0% in inactive placebo). During the 7 -day follow -up period after dosing sessions , participants most commonly reported headache (up to 46.2% in active dose versus 40.0% in inactive placebo) and anxiety (up to 30.8% of active dose participants vers us 40.0% of inactive placebo). In most cases, number of spontaneously reported reactions declined across days of contact. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 97 of 253 In summary, spontaneously reported reactions reported in this small sample of participants with anxiety associated with a life -threa tening illness receiving 125 mg MDMA HCl were similar to those reported in participants with PTSD. Most of these reactions were resolved by day 7 after drug administration, and were almost entirely of mild to moderate intensity, with only a single report o f a severe reaction (diarrhea). Spontaneous Reactions in Social Anxiety in Autistic Adults Spontaneously reported reactions were collected in a sample of 12 individuals within MAPS' study MAA -1 (Appendix Table 17 ). Participants in this study received inactive placebo or ascending active doses, with the first session being either 75 mg or 100 mg MDMA HCl and the second session being 100 mg or 125 mg MDMA HCl ; participants in Stage 2 all received 75 mg in Session 1 an d 125 mg in Session 2. No supplemental dose was administered in this study. Prevalence of reactions is displayed based on number of participants reporting the reaction at least once. The most commonly reported SRRs were anxiety (75.0% of those receiving active dose in blinded sessions and 25.0% of those receiving active dose in open -label sessions versus 25.0% in inactive placebo sessions), lack of appetite (37.5% of those receiving active dose in blinded sessions and 75.0% of those receiving active dose in open -label sessions versus 25% in inactive placebo sessions), and difficulty concentrating (62.5% in active dose blinded sessions, 50% in active dose open -label sessions versus 25% inactive placebo). Additionally, at least 50% of participants in either t he active dose blinded sessions or active dose open -label sessions reported fatigue (vs. 25.0% inactive placebo), headache (vs. 25.0% inactive placebo), inactive placebo), rumination inactive placebo), and sensitivity to cold (0% inactive placebo). The only severe spontaneously reported reaction in this sample was a single report of headache in a participant in the active dose group on the first day of contact. Most commonly re ported SRRs among participants on the autism spectrum with social anxiety during the 7 days after dosing sessions was fatigue (up to 75.0% in the active dose groups versus 50.0% in the inactive placebo group) (Appendix Table 1 7). Low mood (up to 50.0% in the active dose groups vs. 50.0% in the inactive placebo group), headache (up to 37.5% in the active dose groups vs. 25.0% in the inactive placebo group), difficulty concentrating (up to 37.5% in the active dose blinded group vs. 0% in the inactive placebo group), and lack of appetite (up to 37.5% in the active dose blinded group vs. 0% in the inactive placebo group) were also reported. This sample reported experiencing fewer reactions during the 7 -day period tha n participants with PTSD; there were no reports of diarrhea, impaired gait, or nausea. However, the sample consisted of 12 participants, and a slightly lower dose of 75 mg MDMA HCl was used in blinded and open - label sessions. Spontaneously reported reactio ns after 75 mg to 125 mg MDMA HCl in autistic adult participants with social anxiety were also mild to moderate and transient, which was similar to other studies conducted for treatment of different indications. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 98 of 253 Summary of Spontaneous Reactions Across In dications In summary, commonly reported acute and sub -acute reactions to MDMA are generally well - tolerated and are rarely reported after the 24 -hour period beyond drug administration. Reports of reactions grow increasingly rare after the third day of cont act. 6.4.1.3 Adverse Events Summary Adverse Events in Phase 2 PTSD Studies Frequency of A Es among participants with PTSD treated with MDMA at any dose across MAPS - sponsored Phase 2 studies conducted under U.S. IND are summarized in Table 12 . These studies included MP -4, MP -8, MP -9, MP -12, MP16, MP17, and MPVA -1. Adverse events were collected throughout the treatment period and post -treatment (up to 12 -month long -term follow - up). See Table 12 for prevalence of all adverse events regardless of investigator judgement of relationship . In this sample, participants most frequently reported anxiety and fat igue across treatment groups. Anxiety was reported among 20.0% (n=2) of the placebo group participants, 14.3% (n=2) of the blinded 25 -40 mg MDMA HCl group participants, 17.6% (n=13) of the blinded mg MDMA HCl group participants, and 19.7% 80 -150 mg and 13.7% (n=16) respectively. There were 3 reports of anxiety (3.1%) and no reports of fatigue at long -term follow -up to indicate that fatigue and most reports of anxiety occurred during the treatment period. In the comparator and active dose MDMA groups, >5% of all participants reported having a headache: 9.5% (2 of 21 participants) in the blinded 25 -40 mg MDMA HCl , 6.8% in the blinded 75 -125 mg MDMA HCl (5 of 74 participants), and 23.1% (27 of 117 participants) in the open -label 80 -150 mg MDMA HCl group; and there were no reports of headache in the placebo group. Sample sizes in both the placebo and comparator - blinded 25 -40 mg MDMA HCl groups however were relatively low to adequately compare against the active MDMA groups. Therefore, it is unclear whether occurrence of headache might be linked to MDMA treatment. However, there were no reports of headache across all treatment groups at long-term follow -up. Greater than 5% of both blinded and open -label active MDMA dose group participants reported muscle tightness (9.5% vs. 17.1%, respectively) and nausea (5.4% vs. 12.8%, respectively). There was only one other re port of muscle tightness in the placebo group and no other reports of nausea in any other treatment groups. No participant reported headache or nausea at the long -term follow -up. An AE that was most prevalent in the blinded 75 -125 mg MDMA HCl group was irritability (5.4%). In comparison, there was only one other report of irritability, which occurred in the open -label 80 -150 mg MDMA HCl group (0.9%). There were no reports of irritability at long-term follow -up. In contrast, there were a few AE's that were m ore prevalent in the open - label 80 -150 mg MDMA HCl dose group vs. the 75 -125 mg MDMA HCl group; these AEs included upper respiratory infection (7.7% vs. 1.4%, respectively), decreased appetite (6.8% vs. 1.4%, respectively), and insomnia (14.5% vs. 2.7%, re spectively). AEs that were completely unique to the open -label 80 -150 mg suicidal ideation (10.3%). None of these AEs were reported at long -term follow -up. The m ain di fferences between the active blinded and open -label sessions was unblinding of drug and the duration of time in treatment. Specifically, by the time participants were in open -label MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 99 of 253 dosing sessions , they would have already had several therapy sessions prior to active treatment. It is possible that having both the inactive and open -label active MDMA -assisted therapy sessions, compared to only 2 -3 dosing sessions in the blinded active MDMA treatment group, generated more AEs. For example, therapy involves reex amining traumatic experiences, and over the course of several months, this could have triggered mood -related symptoms such as decreased appetite, insomnia, and/ or suicidal ideation. The stress and endurance from prolonged treatment could have compromised participants' immune systems that placed them at higher risk for illness such as an upper respiratory infection. In summary, the AEs that were characteristic of the open -label 80-150 mg MDMA HCl group were likely a consequence of prolonged treatment rather than having an active dose of MDMA.

Absence of these events blinded studies / times may occur because these events were reported as spontaneously reported reactions. See Table 10 and Table 11 . C A previously uncoded event in a previous study (\"passenger in traffic accident, no injury\") has been upversioned to \"road traffic accident\". The number of severe adverse events across all treatment groups was relatively low (Table 13). The only severe AEs that were reported by more than one participant receiving active drug were depressed mood and panic attack, which occurred in the blinded 75 mg to 125 mg MDMA HCl group. Neither were reported in the open -label 80 mg to 150 mg MDM A HCl group or in the long-term follow -up study. At long -term follow -up, there was one report each of severe depression, anxiety, and severe suicidal ideation. The placebo group sample was too small for adequate comparison across groups. Nonetheless, these data suggest the need for careful monitoring of PTSD participants for such psychiatric disorders throughout the study period irrespective of MDMA dose.

MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 106 of 253 Since MDMA i s administered as an adjunct to therapy , judging relationship to MDMA is a known challenge for this combined therapy and highlights the necessity of placebo -controlled trials . In the context of complex medical histories and high rates of background events associated with the PTSD diagnosis, somatic symptoms may wax and wane independent of treatment. In addition, it is known that processing trauma during therapy for PTSD, with or without concomitant pharmacological treatment, can temporarily increase symptom s as an expected aspect of the therapeutic process. This was demonstrated by the high incidence of spontaneously reported reactions and AEs in the placebo group. Among related AEs reported during and after drug administration, somatic symptoms were more frequently experienced in active dose participants, such as pain associated with body tension, muscle tightness, musculoskeletal pain in the shoulder, back pain, and myalgia. As pre viously discussed in Section 6.4.1 Adverse Events , it is difficult to judge relationship between Investigational Product and conditions associated with medical history diagnoses. Pain and somatic symptoms can be directly relate d to traumatic events, such as physical or sexual assault, a motor vehicle accident, or combat [662]. A meta -analytic review and several large studies have found a robust association between PTSD and somatic symptoms, suggesting that PTSD itself may be a contributing factor beyond combat exposure, sexual, or physical abuse that led to the PTSD [663-666]. Although MDMA is not a classic hallucinogen, as classified by chemical structure and mechanism of action, data from sponsor -supported studies suggest MDMA was associated with mild psychedelic effects, such as hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations in one participant and visual distortions in some individuals. Hallucinogenic subjective effects were not actively assessed during therapy sessions, as was done in Phase 1 studies of healthy volunteers [12, 15, 16, 667]. Any unsolicited reports of hallucinogenic effects were collected as AEs in sponsor - supported studies. Adverse Events in Phase 3 PTSD Studies With the placebo -controlled Phase 3 trials of MDMA -assisted therapy for treatment of PTSD, it became possible to separate background events from AEs attributable to MDMA in the Clinical Development Program. AEs were collected from participants treated with blinded MDMA (n=46) or placebo (n=44) in the MAPS -sponsored Phase 3 study MAPP 1 from enrollment to study termination. Treatment -emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) were defined as AEs that occur during the Treatment Period from the first dosing session through the last Integrative Session (3-4 weeks post last dose) . Relationship to MDMA was determined based on relat ive incidence of TEAEs across the study with at least two -fold difference between MDMA vs. placebo . Table 14 below reports on the most common (> 6.5%) TEAEs related to MDMA in this study. In MAPP1 , the most common related TEAEs reported more frequently in the MDMA group were muscle tightness (63.0% MDMA vs 11.4% placebo), appetite feeling cold (19. 6% MDMA vs 6.8% placebo). The full list of related TEAEs is reported below.

Investigator judgement on AE relationship was not collected per protocol, except for SAEs to facilitate regulatory reporting. Common TEAEs reported across both groups of blinded participants were fatigue (30.4% MDMA vs 34.1% placebo), placebo), insomnia % 29.5% placebo), depressed mood (10.9% MDMA vs 9.1% placebo). MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 108 of 253 These commonly reported AEs were observed in both treatment arms and also overlap with symp toms of pre -existing conditions in medical history associated with PTSD (depression, somatic symptoms, insomnia, anxiety), which might have influenced the frequency of events observed during clinical trials of MDMA -assisted therapy. See Table 15 for a listing of TEAEs with a prevalence greater than 5% across both groups in MAPP1.

In Phase 2 studies, among PTSD participants, a total of 9.4% (10 of 106) participants reported an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) that had occurred within 30 days after an active MDMA - assisted session . [Note: In Section 6.4.1.3 Adverse Events Summary , URTI was reported by blinded 75 mg to 125 mg MDMA HCl vs. open -label treatment groups.] Two participants reported an URTI that occurred more than 30 days after an active MDMA -assisted session. One placebo participant, who did not receive any active MDMA, also reported an URTI 3 days following placebo . The Phase 2 sample consi sted of participants from both blinded and open - label active MDMA groups without adequate controls for comparisons. In the Phase 3 placebo -controlled study MAPP1, a total of 26% of participants (12 of 46) reported an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) that had occurred within 30 days after an active MDMA -assisted session and 22% of participants (10 of 44) after an experiment session with placebo. Th ese data su ggest that URTIs were not more common in the MDMA arm than the placebo arm. Of note, while a subset of MAPP1 participants completed study visits following the declaration of the COVID -19 pandemic by the WHO in March 2020, there were no additional URTIs rep orted in the study after this time. While it remains unclear whether reports of URTI are specifically linked to MDMA , the relative incidence in the placebo -controlled Phase 3 trial indicates relationship to MDMA is unlikely . There is additionally evidence from multiple epidemiologic studies to suggest that having a stress -related disorder, including PTSD, was associated with higher risk of infections, with hazard MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 110 of 253 ratios ranging from 1.47 (95% CI: 1.37, 1.58) [668] to 1.8 (95% CI: 1.6, 2.0) [669]. Therefore, even without any treatment, PTSD participants might be at increased risk of infections that could include COVID -19. At present, there is no evidence to suggest MDMA -assisted therapy would increase these risks. 6.4.1.4 Serious Adverse Events of Suicidality Overall, the incidence of serious suicidal ideation or behavior in sponsor -supported studies was low, occurring in only a few participants post -MDMA treatment and an equivalent number of participants either prior to dosing or after therapy with placebo, and returning to lower scores while participants were closely monitored. As of March 01, 2022 , three participants reported SAEs of suicidality (suicidal ideation and/or behavior) after receiving MDMA in MAPS - supported Phase 1, Phase 2 , and Phase 3 studies. All were deemed unrelated to MDMA in the opinion of the investigator and sponsor. Of interest, three participants reported SAEs of suicidality either prior to receiving study drug (n=1, Study MP -2), or after receiving placebo (n=2, Study MAPP1). These events are likely related to background events representing the underlying illness being treated, or the expected result of therapy addressing traumatic experiences. In study MP -8, suicidal ideation was reported in a participant in study MP -8, rep orted 6 days after treatment with 30 mg MDMA HCl and lasted 6 days, concurrent with increased depressive symptoms triggered by external trauma cues, and was treated with prescription medication and hospitalization. The participant who experienced suicidal ideation later experienced depression that was rated serious and unrelated to the Investigational Product, with the event occurring approximately 9 months after a final dosing session . The episode resolved approximately 3 weeks after it developed. Depression in this subject was rated severe. The depression led to hospitalization, and the participant reported full recovery after the episode. In Study MP -1-E2, an extension to study MP -1 involving a single additional administration of 125 mg MDMA HCl for participants exhibiting relapse after completing the study, a participant was hospitalized with major depressive episode and suicidal ideation 9 months after the additional dosing sessio n, and fully recovered after this episode. In Study MP16, a Phase 2 open -label study, there was one SAE of suicide attempt. Twenty -eight days after the 3rd dosing session with a divided dose of 180 mg MDMA HCl (120 mg + 60 mg MDMA HCl) , the participant initiated a suicide attempt by taking diazepam, drinking alcohol, and taking a bath with the intent to drown herself. The event was aborted with no bodily harm. The participant was evaluated at the ER without being admitted and discharged 3 hours later. Adverse Events in Social Anxiety in Autistic Adults In autistic adult participants with social anxiety (MAA -1), the frequency of any given AE in each study group was less than 25% (or 1 to 2 participants). The majority of AEs were psychiatric disorders (te n in active dose groups and two in the inactive placebo group), followed by infections and infestations (three in active dose groups and two in the inactive placebo group ) (see Appendix Table 20 for more details). Participants in th e blinded 75 mg to 125 mg MDMA HCl group reported the highest proportion of depressed mood (25%) and suicidal ideation (25%). There was no report of depressed mood in the placebo group, although there was one report of depression. There was also one count of suicidal ideation in the placebo group. The occurrence of depressed mood/ depression and suicidal ideation in both blinded placebo and 75 mg to 125 mg MDMA HCl groups suggest these AEs likely occurred independent of drug administration. There MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 111 of 253 were three counts of panic attack/ panic reac tion in only active dose groups, which might be attributed to dru g administration. There were no severe adverse events reported in the study. However, small sample size warrants further investigation to elucidate relationships between AEs and MDMA -assisted therapy in autistic adults with social anxiety. Adverse Events in Anxiety Associated with Life -threatening Illness Adverse events reported during the study of MDMA -assisted therapy in participants with anxiety in response to facing life -threatening dis orders (MDA -1) included psychiatric disorders, nervous system disorders, gastrointestinal symptoms, and infections ( Appendix Table 21 ). Of the seven AEs rated as severe, six AEs occurred in a single individual after cancer reoccurre nce: meningitis, sepsis, aphasia, cerebrovascular accident, and spinal cord paralysis . The participant's last visit was the Primary Endpoint. The subject died prior to Long -term Follow -up. The other severe AE (invasive ductal breast carcinoma) occurred in a different participant during the long -term follow - up. Overall, 40.0% of blinded placebo participants, 84.6% of blinded 125 mg MDMA HCl participants, and 41.2% of open -label 125 mg HCl participants reported any AE's during dosing sessions . The most commonly reported AE was insomnia, which was reported among 20.0% of blinded placebo participants, 15.4% of blinded 125 mg MDMA HCl participants, and open -label 125 HCl partic ipants. Three counts of fatigue (23.1%) were reported only among blinded 125 mg MDMA HCl participants. It may be possible drug administration was linked to insomnia and fatigue, which were also commonly reported AEs in other sponsor -supported study samples . In this sample, apart from insomnia, all other psychiatric AEs were reported by participants in active dose groups. Anxiety was reported in one blinded 125 mg MDMA HCl participant and two open -label 125 mg MDMA HCl participants, which was expected given the indication under study. There were single reports of bruxism, depressed mood, depression, dissociation, and hypomania in either the blinded 125 mg MDMA HCl or open -label 125 mg MDMA HCl groups. Non-psychiatric AEs with more than one count included in fluenza (15.4%), contusion (15.4%), and back pain (15.4%), which occurred only among blinded 125 mg MDMA HCl participants, although these events were likely unrelated to drug administration. Similarly, there were a total of nine participants, and a total o f 16 AEs, that were reported at 12 -month follow -up across all study participants. But, given the small sample sizes, it is unlikely that any occurrence of AEs 1 year or more following dosing sessions were associated with the study treatment. One subject in this study experienced a cascade of adverse events, including several SAEs, after completing the course of the main study and prior to or at long -term follow -up that all followed from recurrence of chordoma. This event was expected given the participant 's medical history of chordoma. After the recurrence was noted, the subject received one additional dosing session . She then underwent debulking surgery, radiation, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy for treatment before significant deterioration (including s pinal cord paralysis, spinal meningitis, septicemia, and cerebrovascular accident followed by aphasia and inability to speak) and subsequent death. It is challenging to make comparisons or draw conclusions about nature or frequency of adverse events in this sample owing to small sample size. Psychiatric AEs in general, and anxiety in particular, are expected in this patient population and with MDMA co mbined with therapy that encourages confronting emotionally distressing material. It is also expected that participants diagnosed with a life -threatening illness may experience more severe AEs related to their medical history. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 112 of 253 6.4.1.5 Serious Adverse Reactions SARs are serious adverse events possibly or probably related to MDMA administration. As of March 01, 2022, there has been one SAR reported in the clinical development program following MDMA administration across indications . See Table 16 below for a summary of SARs . Table 16: Serious Adverse Reactions in Sponsor -Supported Studies of MDMA - Assisted Therapy Across Indications Dose Comparator Dose 0-40 mg MDMA HCl Ventricular Extrasystoles (exacerbation) --- --- 1 One cardiac SAR has occurred within all sponsor -supported studies to date. In a PTSD study (MP-8), subject 0811 experienced an increase in frequency of ventricular extrasystoles, a form of cardiac arrhythmia, on the day of his third and final dosing sessio n with open -label 125 mg MDMA HCl . The subject had no other signs and no symptoms of cardiac distress. In the absence of any symptoms of coronary insufficiency, the investigator judged the only medical measure necessary to be withholding the supplemental d ose of MDMA. This was the final drug administration in the open -label crossover period of the study known as Stage 2. No similar events were detected during the first two 125 mg MDMA HCl dosing sessions , nor the two blinded dosing sessions with 30 mg MDMA HCl in the blinded period of the study known as Stage 1. There was no evidence of acute cardiac damage or ischemia or underlying heart disease. At baseline during screening, the subject had one ventricular extrasystole on the electrocardio gram (EKG), but the EKG was otherwise normal. The subject had a positive family history: his father had a coronary artery bypass graft, which had prompted the subject to consult a cardiologist several years before study enrollment, and the cardiologist's n ote indicated that he did not suspect cardiovascular disease or see the need for further workup. Based on the medical history and clinical presentation of this subject, the investigator judged the SAR to be a moderate exacerbation probably related to drug administration, although since the subject was under observation when the event was noted, it cannot be determined if the same event occurred undetected prior to MDMA administration while the subject was not being monitored. The event required overnight mo nitoring in the hospital but did not lead to any adverse sequelae. He was given one dose of 25 mg metoprolol by the hospital physician but did not require any ongoing treatment. Serial cardiac isoenzymes, an echocardiogram and a nuclear stress test perform ed during the overnight hospital admission failed to show evidence of cardiovascular or other cardiac disease. Full recovery occurred 1 day after MDMA administration. Arrhythmia is described in Section 5.1.2 Cardiac Disorders and Section 6.2.3.2 Cardiovascular System as an expected adverse effect of MDMA based on scientific literature and does not rise to the level of inclusion in the Reference Safety Information since the 13th Edition of the IB issued in March 2021 as it has been observed once in the Clinical Development Program . Adverse Event s Summary Most AEs reported in MAPS supported studies were rated mild or moderate and transient in nature. The most common treatment -emergent adverse events more prevalent in the MDMA group from blinded, placebo -controlled Phase 3 study data were (>20%) muscle tightness, MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 113 of 253 decreased appetite, nausea, (>10%) hyperhidrosis, feeling cold, restlessness, mydriasis, postural dizziness, bruxism, nystagmus, increased blood pressure, feeling jittery, non -cardiac chest pain, and dry mouth . Common anxiety -related psychiatric symptoms w ere reported equally in both the MDMA and placebo arms in the Phase 3 trial. As of March 01, 2022 , there have been 19 event - level SAEs in 14 participants in the clinical development program following MDMA administration across indications. Of these, 18 wer e unrelated and one was determined to be a SAR . This cardiac event (increase in frequency of ventricular extrasystoles), that occurred in Study MP -8 was reported as a SAR and i s described above. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Events ( SUSAR s) were inf requent in the program and the sponsor closely monitors any SUSARs to determine if any should be upgraded to SARs. To date, there has been one SUSAR of preparatory suicidal behavior that was subsequently downgraded to an SAE when it was determined that th e participant was randomized to placebo. If any new risks are identified, the IB will be updated with this information accordingly. 6.4.2 Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Suicidal ideation and behavior are disease related events in populations of people with PTSD , occurring at high frequencies, especially those suffering from chronic, treatment -resistant PTSD [670, 671]. The FDA has responded to concerns over the occurrence of treatment -emergent suicidal ideation or behavior by requiring clinical trials of psychiatric drugs to measure suicidality via the C -SSRS, a cl inician -administered guided interview [672]. Individuals with serious ideation or behavior are to be closely monitored until levels return to normal or additional interventions are recommended by the therapist. Data on suicidal ideation or behavior was not formally measur ed in the first two sponsor - supported studies (MP -1 and MP -2). The C -SSRS was added to subsequent studies in order to monitor suicidal ideation and behavior. The C -SSRS was assessed throughout each study, including lifetime incidence, baseline , before/duri ng/after drug administration, endpoints when other measures were administered, and follow -up visits. In MDMA -assisted therapy , thoughts of suicide may surface due to the nature of the therapeutic method, wherein a person may re - experience emotions associat ed with the traumatic event and reprocess the memory. However, evidence from clinical studies indicates that these thoughts were more often transient, returned to normal, or even improved following MDMA treatment. 6.4.2.1 C-SSRS in PTSD Studies Suicidal ideation and behavior were collected using the C -SSRS and data are reported according to the C -SSRS Scoring and Data Analysis Guide [673]. The presence of suicidal ideation was reported when a subject responded \"yes\" to any one of the five suicidal ideation questions (Categories 1 to 5) on the C -SSRS (i.e., a score >0 for suicidal ideation score). Serious suicidal ideation was a suicidal ideation category score of 4 or 5. The presenc e of suicidal behavior was reported when a subject responded \"yes\" to any one of the five suicidal behavior questions (Categories 6 to 10) on the C -SSRS (i.e., a score >0 for suicidal behavior score). Lifetime scores accounted for all suicidal ideation and behavior prior to enrollment accord ing to subject recall and medical records. Pre -drug exposure represents measures collected on the Since Last Visit C - SSRS after enrollment during Preparatory Sessions and before first drug administration in dosing session 1 upon completion of tapering off psychiatric medications. Frequencies were presented as subject counts at each time point. When time points covered multiple visits, percentages were based on the number of observations in which participants would have had the opportunity to report. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 114 of 253 Phase 2 C-SSRS Data In studies MP -4, MP -8, MP -9, MP -12, MPVA -1, MP16, and MP17, the majority of participants reported lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation and there were some reports of serious ideation and suicidal behavior, which was expected among study samples diagnosed with PTSD ( see Table 17 ). At baseline , or Pre -drug Exposure (i.e., in the Preparatory Session prior to dosing session 1), compared to lifetime prevalence, there were far fewer reports of the presence of suicidal ideation, no reports of serious ideation, and one report of the presence of suicidal behavior. Overall, participants in the blinded active dose (75 mg to 125 mg MDMA HCl) and open -label Stage 2 active dose (100 mg to 125 mg MDMA HCl) groups reported the pre sence of suicidal ideation throughout the dosing sessions at pre -drug, during -drug, and integration days 1, 2, and 7. The prevalence of reported ideations , particularly in the earlier dosing session , might have been due to withdrawal symptoms after prescription medications tapering of SSRIs and/ and benzodiazepines [674-676], which was a study eligibility criterion. Additionally, in both the non - drug and active MDMA -assisted therapy sessions, participants were asked to recall and discuss experiences related to their PTSD diagnosis, which could have triggered thoughts of suicidality throughout the dosing sessions . Therefore, it is not surprising participants in the blinded active dose (75 mg to 125 mg MDMA HCl) and open -label Stage 2 active dose (100 mg to 125 mg MDMA HCl) groups had reported ideation throughout the dosing sessions . At post -treatment, following all dosing sessions , blinded active dose (75 mg to 125 mg MDMA HCl) group participants continued to report ideation at the Primary or Secondary Endpoint, End of Stage 1 or 2, and Long -term Follow -up: 34.9% (15 of 43 participants), 28.9% (11 of 38 participants), and 27.7% (13 of 47 participants), respectively; and, there were a few reports of serious ideation: 4.7% (2 of 43 participants), 0 (0 of 38 participants), and 2.1% (1 of 47 partic ipants), respectively. In the open -label Stage 2 active dose (100 mg to 125 mg MDMA HCl) group, 5 participants reported ideation at Primary or Secondary Endpoint, 3 participants at End of Stage 1 or 2, and 0 at Long -term Follow -up. Among the placebo group and blinded 25 mg to 40 mg MDMA HCl group, at any given post -treatment assessment of CSSRS, there were only up to one participant who reported having ideation: 1 of 2 participants in the placebo and 1 of 12 to 13 participants in the blinded comparator grou p; and no reports of serious ideation or suicidal behavior. In the context of MDMA -assisted therapy , MDMA can modulate consolidation [282, 284, 677, 678].

Table 18 and Figure 7 below present the prevalence of participants reporting suicidal ideation and behavior measured by C -SSRS in MAPP1. At baseline, 37% of participants in the MDMA group reported the presence of suicidal ideation, compared to 31.8% in the placebo group. After the first dosing session, 4.3% of participants reported suicidal ideation in the MDMA group, and 13.6% in the placebo group. Presence of suicidal ideation increased in both groups after the first dosing session during follow -up assessments at the three integrative sessions. After the second dosing session, 2.3% of participants in the MDMA group reported the presence of suicidal ideation, compared to 7.3% of placebo participants. Prevalence of suicidal ideation increased in the follow -up integrative sessions. After the third dosing session, no participants in the MDMA group reported the presence o f suicidal ideation, serious ideation, or positive behavior, while one participant in the placebo group reported the presence of suicidal ideation. At the integrative session that occurred the next morning, 19% of participants in the MDMA group and 30.8% o f participants in the placebo group reported the presence of suicidal ideation. At study termination, 18.2% of subjects reported the presence of suicidal ideation, compared to 20.0% of participants in the placebo group.

Overall, the number of subjects reporting the presence of suicidal ideation varied throughout the study visits , but never exceeded the prevalence at baseline levels and was not increased in the MDMA group. Serious ideation ( defined as a score of 4 or 5 on the C -SSRS) was minimal during the study and almost entirely present in subjects in the placebo group. Throughout the study, there were two reports of serious ideation in the MDMA group and 22 reports of serious ideation in the placebo group. Importantly, no increase in adverse events related to suicidality were observed in the MDMA group. C-SSRS in Social Anxiety in Autistic Adults In MAA -1, the MDMA study in autistic adults, 0 to 12.5% of participants had a history of serious suicidal ideation and 12.5 to 25.0% reported suicidal behavior. During the preparatory phase prior to blinded drug administration, there were no reports of sui cidal ideation or behavior. There was one report of positive ideation on the day of an MDMA -assisted session, and one on the day following. At endpoints, 25.0 to 50.0% had positive ideation. Two participants reported positive ideation, although not serious , during follow -up which may have resulted from ending the therapeutic relationship. These participants were transitioned to non -study therapists and went back on psychiatric medications under the care of their prescribing physician. No serious ideation or behavior occurred during the study. Generally, rates of suicidal thoughts were lower in this population than the PTSD sample (see Appendix Tabl es 10 -12).

During the preparatory phase prior to blinded drug administration, one participant experienced positive beh avior, and 25.0% had positive ideation. There were no reports of suicidal ideation or behavior during the Preparatory Sessions or during the treatment period. One occurrence of positive ideation was recorded at the Primary Endpoint and long -term follow -up (see Appendix Tables: 13-16). Summary of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Across Populations and Indications Overall , the incidence of serious suicidal ideation or behavior in sponsor -supported studies was low, fluctuating in some participants post-treatment with MDMA -assisted therapy and placebo with therapy , and returning to category 1 to 3 suicidal ideation scores whi le participants were closely monitored. Given that severe PTSD sufferers are known to experience suicidal ideation and behavior, it is difficult to identify a single cause of the increase in suicidal thinking or behavior (i.e., exacerbation of PTSD symptom s, MDMA -stimulated effects, or processing of traumatic memories during therapy ). A large percentage of people enrolled in the studies reported suicidal ideation and behavior during sometime in their lives prior to study enrollment, which may reflect a mani festation of PTSD or co -morbid affective disorders. When positive serious ideation or behavior occurred after enrollment, the investigators made follow -up observations of C-SSRS to ensure subject safety and tracked scores until they returned to non -serious levels. Frequency of ideation and behavior was greater in the PTSD population compared to healthy individuals, autistic adults, and people with life -threatening illnesses. In the placebo -controlled Phase 3 trial MAPP1, the prevalence of suicidal ideation, serious ideation, and suicidal behavior was not greater in the MDMA arm of the study. Throughout the study, there were two instances of serious ideation reported via the C -SSRS in the MDMA group and 22 instances of serious ideation in the placebo group. 6.4.3 Vital Signs In all sponsor -supported studies to date, vital signs readings (temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate) were taken at baseline , with study -specific differences in data collection times post - drug. The data presented in the below sections is final for completed studies and preliminary for studies ongoing at the time of the data cutoff. 6.4.3.1 Body Temperature In most sponsor -supported studies to date, tympanic body temperature readings were taken at baseline , then every 60 to 90 minutes after drug administration during each blinded or open -label dosing session , with some differences in collection methods across studies. Peak values during each dosing session were ascertained for all studies. Across studies, the final value was either at a relatively set time (MP -8, MP -12, MP1 -E2, MP16, MP17, MPVA -1) or as the final reading with varying time points (MP -1). In the MP -1 and MP -2 studies two pre -drug values were reported (15 minutes and 5 minutes before dosing) and the results of these measurements were averaged. Average post -drug values served as the final value for MP -2. If body temperature rose >1\u00b0 C above the pre -drug (baseline) reading, each duration above specific values required more frequent monitoring as listed in the study protocols. Clinical sig ns and symptoms were monitored and more frequent readings of body temperature were collected in cases where readings were above these values.

Note that body temperature above 1\u00b0C above pre -drug reading was observed in 20% (2 of 10) of participants who received placebo. End of session temperature readings were lower than peak drug readings, though they remained above pre -drug measurements. Body temperature increases that were 1\u00b0C or more above initial temperature occurred in all dose groups, suggesting a minimal role for dose. The maximum body temperature observed for any subject receiving MDMA was 38.7\u00b0C, obser ved after a 100 mg MDMA HCl blinded session, and during open -label sessions. No participants required medical intervention to decrease body temperature and values returned to baseline as drug effects waned. Body temperature measured during dosing sessions in sponsor -supported studies of PTSD was commensurate with values seen in Phase 1 clinical trials described above. In the MAPS study MAA -1, body temperature 1\u00b0C above pre -drug reading was detected in 28.6% (2 of 7) participants who received 100 mg MDMA HCl during a blinded session. Body temperature above the 1\u00b0C increase predetermined as cause for increased assessment did not occur during open -label sessions with 75 mg or 125 mg MDMA HCl. The maximum body temperature observed for any subject rece iving MDMA in MAA -1 was 37.7\u00b0C. No participants required medical intervention to decrease body temperature and values dropped below peak values or returned to baseline as drug effects waned. Body temperature measurements in this sample were similar to thos e reported in Phase 1 studies and the sample of people with PTSD ( see Appendix Table s 2, 4, 6, and 8 for data). In the MAPS study -Phase 2 clinical trial of MDMA -assisted therapy for anxiety in relation to a life-threatening illness (MDA -1), body temperature rose 1\u00b0C above pre -drug reading in 53.8% (7 of 13) of participants receiving MDMA during blinded dosing sessions and in none of the participants given placebo du ring blinded sessions. Body temperature rose 1\u00b0C above pre -drug reading in 52.9% (9 of 17) participants during open -label sessions. Body temperature recorded at end of session was lower than peak body temperature. The maximum body temperature observed MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 121 of 253 for any subject receiving 125 mg MDMA HCl was 39.9\u00b0C. No participants required medical intervention to decrease body temperature and values returned to baseline as drug effects waned (see Appendix Tables 3, 5, 7, and 9 for data) . In MPVA -1, vital signs were assessed on the day of MDMA -assisted sessions prior to drug dosing, just before the optional supplemental dose (midpoint), and at the end of the session. The maxim um body temperature observed for any subject receiving 75 mg or 100 mg MDMA HCl was 38.4\u00b0C and the mean (SD) temperature prior to the supplemental dose was 37.1\u00b0C (SD :0.53) in the CSO participant and 37.2\u00b0C (SD :0.48) in the PTSD+ participant. In the MAPS sponsored Phase 3 PTSD study MAPP1, participants in both groups had minor increases (on average <1\u00b0C) in body temperature during dosing sessions . The maximum body temperature observed for any subject receiving 80 mg or 120 mg MDMA HCl) was 38.1\u00b0C and the m ean temperature prior to the supplemental dose was 36.9\u00b0C.

Humans are not susceptible to changes in ambient temperature when given MDMA, exhibiting slight to moderate increases in body temperature regardless of the temperature of the MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 122 of 253 environme nt. Findings from previous Phase 1 trials indicate that MDMA administered in a controlled setting produces a statistically but not clinically significant increase in body temperature (mean elevation of 0.6\u00b0C). Controlled clinical settings have been suffici ent to manage body temperature in humans. In the above MAPS -sponsored studies, adjustments were made to the ambient temperature and to air circulation in the room in response to observed elevation in body temperatures, but no participants required medical intervention to decrease body temperature, and values returned to baseline as drug effects waned. Body temperature greater than 1\u00b0C above baseline was detected after any dose of MDMA, in 44% of participants with PTSD, with most of these cases observed in s essions with 125 mg MDMA HCl . In individuals with autism or a life -threatening illness, 29% and 50% of subject respectively exhibited elevated body temperature after 100 mg to 125 mg MDM A HCl. In contrast, in 20% of participants that were administered therapy with placebo had an elevation of body temperature above cut -off in PTSD studies. Both peak and longest duration of body temperature elevation were observed in the 125 mg MDMA HCl group. Across all indications, the maximum peak reading was 38.7\u00b0C. Findi ngs from the MAPP1 Phase 3 trial showed a similar pattern for transient increases in body temperature in the MDMA group. In conclusion, controlled settings for treatments with MDMA -assisted therapy were sufficiently optimized with the capacity to control t he ambient temperature for subject comfort, though there is no evidence that these measures significantly influenced or were needed for control of core body temperature. 6.4.3.2 Cardiovascular System In all sponsor -supported studies to date, blood pressure readi ngs were taken at baseline, with study -specific differences in data collection times after drug administration. Peak values during each dosing session were ascertained for studies MP-1 through MP -12. In MP16, MP17, and MPVA -1, peak values were collected just prior to the optional supplemental dose (midpoint). The final or endpoint was recorded as the final value at a relatively set time (MP -8, MP -12, MP16, MP17, MPVA -1), as the final value available, or with varying timepoints (MP -1). MP -1 and MP - 2 reported two pre -drug values (15 minutes and 5 minutes before dosing) and the results of these measurements were averaged, whereas all other studies reported a single time point pre -drug. Average post -drug values served as the final value for MP -2. If systolic blood pressure (SBP) rose above 160 mmHg or if diastolic blood pressure (DBP) rose above 110 mmHg, additional measurements were collected in studies MP -8, MP -12, MP -9, and MP -4. In MAA -1, if SBP rose above 180 mmHg or if DBP rose above 110 m mHg, each duration above the pre -determined cut - off was collected. If SBP rose above 180 mmHg and DBP rose above 120 mmHg, each timepoint above the pre -determined cut -off was collected in MDA -1. The cut -off for blood pressure (as SBP/DBP) in MP -2 was >160/ 110 mmHg. Clinical signs and symptoms were monitored and more frequent readings were collected in cases where readings were above the cut -off. Systolic and diastolic pressure data are presented separately. SBP results are summarized in Tables 21 -23 and DBP results summarized in Tables 24 -26, and in Appendix Tables 4 -7. Values recorded during blinded sessions and those from open -label sessions are reported separately (see Appendix Tables 4 -7). Candidates with hypertension were excluded from participation in early sponsor -supported studies, but more recent studies have allowed enrollment of participants with well -controlled hypertension. For example, in MP -8, four pa rticipants with hypertension controlled by medications were permitted to enroll after completion of carotid ultrasound and nuclear stress test (per protocol) in addition to usual medical screening for the study ( see Table 22 and Table 25 , below, for data from these participants). MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 123 of 253 Systolic Blood Pressure In MAPS -sponsored Phase 2 studies, t he observed increase in SBP was greater when doses of 75 mg MDMA HCl or more of MDMA were administered. In MAPS -sponsored PTSD studies MP -1 through MP -12, systolic blood pressure above 160 mmHg was detected in 32% (30 of 95) participants who received MDMA at any dose during blinded sessions. It is notable that the majority of these cases occurred after 125 mg of MDMA HCl, but failed to occur after inactive placebo or doses lower than 30 mg MDMA HCl . SBP rose above 160 mm Hg in 36% (28 of 78) participants after 100 mg to 150 mg of MDMA HCl in open -label sessions. Similar to blinded sessions, SBP returned to baseline levels at the end of the session. The maximum systolic blood pressure for any subject receiving MDMA was 200 mmHg. Final (end of session) values returned to pre -drug levels with no clinical intervention required. No clinically significant AEs were reported based on elevations in blood pressure and no treatment was required for these transient elevations of blood pressure. In, the MPVA -1 study, after two open -label sessions with 75 mg to 100 mg MDMA HCl, both membe rs of dyads consisting of people with PTSD and concerned significant others exhibited a rise in systolic blood pressure in a study of MDMA -assisted therapy and cognitive -behavioral conjoint therapy (CBCT). SBP returned to near baseline levels at the closin g of a dosing session , with final readings 0.5 to 2.6 units higher than baseline . Additional or high SBP values were not recorded for any of the participants. Peak SBP was not recorded per protocol. Observed SBP did not appear to differ on the basis of PTS D diagnosis. Maximum recorded SBP during this study was 180 mmHg in a concerned significant other at dosing session midpoint. Table 21: Pre-drug, Peak, and Final Systolic Blood Pressure During Dosing Sessions with Placebo or any MDMA Dose in MAPS -Sponsored Studies of PTSD (MP -1, MP - 2, MP -4, MP -8, MP -12) MDMA HCl Dose N Pre-drug Mean (SD) Min/Max Peak Mean (SD) Min/Max Final Mean (SD) Min/Max N (%) with SBP Above 160 mm -8, systolic blood pressure above 160 mmHg was detected in 75% (3 of 4) of participants with hypertension kept controlled by medication during blinded sessions with 30 mg to 125 mg MDMA HCl and in 67% (2 of 3) participants receiving 100 mg to 125 mg M DMA HCl during open -label sessions. No increase in SBP >160 mmHg occurred after administration of 30 mg MDMA HCl. The maximum systolic blood pressure for these participants with controlled hypertension was 193 mmHg, which occurred during an open -label session. The baseline values MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 124 of 253 and elevations after MDMA appear higher in this sub -group than the overall sample but a ny meaningful comparison is limited by the sample size. Pre -drug SBP was typically higher in this sub-group, and peak SBP of these participants was typically at the upper end of the range of the overall sample. Final SBP readings remained 11 to 14 mmHg hig her on average than pre -drug SBP readings in the subject who received 75 mg MDMA HCl in two blinded dosing sessions and 100 mg HCl in three open -label crossover dosing sessions . However, two participants who received 125 mg MDMA HCl had final readings that returned to pre -drug values, which might suggest these could have been due to these individual's medical history of both hypertension and hyperlipidemia. One subject with controlled hypertension dropped out (not due to blood pressure concerns) after receiving a single dosing session with 30 mg MDMA HCl but did not experience SBP above 160 mmHg. None of the participants with controlled hypertension experienced AEs of the cardiovascular system and SBP returned to baseline or near -baseline levels at fina l session reading without any additional medication. Table 22: Pre-drug, Peak, and Final Systolic Blood Pressure During Dosing Sessions in Controlled Hypertension Participants in MAPS -Sponsored PTSD Study MP -8 MDMA HCl Dose N Pre-drug Mean (SD) Min/Max Peak Mean (SD) Min/Max Final Mean (SD) Min/Max SBP Above 160 mm HG N 30 mg 1 125 125/125 131 131/131 124 124/124 0 75 mg 1 139 (8.49) 133/145 174.5 (6.36) 170/179 147 147/147 systolic blood pressure did not rise above 180 mmHg during blinded sessions with inactive placebo or 75 mg to 125 mg MDMA HCl, nor during open -label sessions with 75 mg to 125 mg MDMA HCl [89]. The maximum systolic blood pressure for any subject receiving MDMA was 174 mmHg, which occurred after 75 mg MDMA HCl) . Peak SBP values in this sample suggests slightly lower values than in studies in people with PTSD, but the sample was much smaller, and this may reflect a chance fluctuation. It is also notable that, in general, this study employed lower active doses of MDMA than the PTSD studies. Final values returned to pre-drug levels with no clinical intervention required. No clinically significant AEs were reported based on elevations in blood pressure (see Appendix Table 4 ). In the MDA -1 stud y, systolic blood pressure rose above threshold (180 mmHg) in 54% (7 of 13) of participants who received 125 mg MDMA HCl during blinded sessions and in 29% (5 of 17) after open -label 125 mg MDMA HCl sessions. In comparison, SBP above 180 mm Hg was detected in 40% (2 of 5) of participants who received placebo. The maximum systolic blood pressure for any subject receiving MDMA was 196 mmHg, observed after 125 mg MDMA HCl in an open -label session. Final values returned to pre -drug levels with no clinical inter vention required. No clinically significant AEs were reported based on elevations in blood pressure. SBP values in this sample appear to be similar to values reported in sample with PTSD (see Appendix Table 5 ). In the MAPS sponsored Phase 3 PTSD study MAPP1, participants in the MDMA group had transient increases (on average +16 mmHg) in systolic blood pressure (SBP) during dosing sessions that returned to pre -drug levels at the end of the session s. Participants in the placebo group had relatively stable SBP across sessions.

No clinically significant AEs were reported based on elevations in blood pressure. Diastolic Blood Pressure In MAPS -sponsored Phase 2 PTSD studi es, doses of 75 mg and 125 mg MDMA HCl produced greater elevation in DBP than lower doses of 25 mg to 40 mg MDMA HCl . The lower increase in DBP after 100 mg MDMA HCl may reflect random variation in a small sample. At the end of session or final reading, DBP had returned to baseline levels across all doses of MDMA. DBP above 110 mmHg was detected in 7% (7 of 95) of participants who received any dose of MDMA during blinded study sessions, and 6.4% (5 of 78) participants who received 100 mg to 150 mg MDMA HCl during open -label sessions. The maximum diastolic blood pressure for any subject receiving MDMA was 135 mmHg, and no clinical intervention was required. No clinically significant AEs were reported based on elevations in blood pressure. These observations su ggest that people with PTSD experience similar elevations in SBP and DBP as those seen in healthy controls. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 126 of 253 MPVA -1 was the open -label study of MDMA -assisted psychotherapy and CBCT in dyads made up of one person with PTSD and a significant other without P TSD. DBP was elevated at midpoint compared with baseline in both groups (3.6 to 11.3 mmHg) and returned to near -baseline levels after 75 mg to 100 mg MDMA HCl . DBP returned to baseline or near -baseline levels at session end (dropping 4.5 to 7.5 mmHg). The highest value was recorded at midpoint (106 mm Hg). No additional readings were required during either dosing session .

Diastolic blood pressure above 110 mmHg was detected in 25% (1 of 4) participants with controlled hypertension in blinded sessions and in one of three participants who received 100 mg to 125 mg MDMA HCl during open -label sessions. The maximum DBP for these participants with controlled hypertension was 125 mmHg. Final values returned to pre -drug levels at end of session with no clinical intervention required. No clin ically significant AEs were reported based on elevations in blood pressure.

At the end of the session, DBP returned to baseline levels in all blinded and open -label dosing sessions . DBP above 110 mmHg was not detected during any session, regardless of dose. The maximum DBP for any subject receiving MDMA was 106 mmHg, which occurred after inactive placebo administration. Final (end of session) values returned to pre -drug levels with no clinical intervention required. No clinically significant AEs were reported based on elevations in blood pressure (see Appendix Table 6 ). In the MDA -1 study, peak DBP was higher after 125 mg MDMA HCl than after inactive placebo as expected, and final values returned to pre -drug levels with no clinical intervention required. Diastolic blood pressure above 120 mmHg was detected in 31% (4 of 13) participants who received 125 mg MDMA HCl during blinded se ssions and 11.8% (2 of 17) participants receiving MDMA during open -label sessions. In comparison, diastolic blood pressure above threshold was detected in 20% (1 of 5) of participants who received placebo. The maximum DBP for any MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 129 of 253 subject receiving MDMA was 154 mmHg, which was observed in a subject who received 125 mg MDMA HCl. No clinically significant AEs were reported based on elevations in blood pressure and DBP returned back to pre -drug levels with no treatment required (see Appen dix Table 7 ). Summary of Blood Pressure Effects The supplemental dose, when administered 1.5 to 2.5 hours after the initial dose, may cause further SBP increases above that of the initial dose of MDMA. In one study (MP -1), 9 of 23 participants received the supplemental dose, with four in the 125 mg MDMA HCl group. In all subsequent studies, most of the participants received the optional supplemental dose. A comparison of participants receiving the supplemental dose to those who only received the initial dose in MP -1 indicated that the supplemental dose did not cause further elevation in blood pressure or heart rate beyond the initial dose, although the sample was underpowered to detect a significant effect. Maximum SBP observed to date was 201 mmHg in a s ingle MAPP1 participant 2 hours after administ ration of 120 mg MDMA HCl as the initial dose. A repeat measurement two minutes following this reading showed a S BP of 162 mmHg. This participant had a medical history of prediabetes and hypercholesterolemia/hy perlipidemia. The next closest observation to this maximum was 200 mmHg in a single MP -2 participant who was administered 125 mg MDMA HCl as the initial dose which lasted 5 hours. This participant had a medical history of mild systolic hypertension, and the traumatic event that caused PTSD for this participant was medical malpractice. This participant was only enrolled after 24 -hour monitoring of blood pressure at baseline to confirm this diagnosis. None of the participants with control led hypertension whose BP was kept normal with medications experienced AEs of the cardiovascular system and no lasting effects on the transient increases in BP measurements have been observed in any of the clinical trials. Despite elevations in SBP and to a lesser extent DBP , no clinical signs or symptoms of hypertension were observed, and no additional treatment was required. In all cases across the Clinical Development Program, including in participants with PTSD, autistic adults with social anxiety, and people with anxiety arising from facing a life -threatening illness, blood pressure returned to pre -drug levels at end of session with no clinical intervention required. No clinically significant AEs were reported based on elevations in blood pressure. Heart Rate In all sponsor -supported studies to date, heart rate readings were taken at baseline , with study - specific differences in data collection times after drug administration. Peak values during each dosing session were ascertained for all studies. The final or endpoint value was recorded as the final value, either at a relatively set time (MP -4, MP -8, MP -9, MP -12, MP16, MP17, MPVA -1) or as the final value available, with varying time points (MP -1). MP -1 and MP -2 reported two pre-drug values (15 minutes and 5 minutes before dosing) and these measurements were averaged, whereas all other studies reported single time point pre -drug value. Average post -drug values serve as the final value for MP -2. If heart rate rose above 110 beats per minute (bpm), each duration above the pre -determined cut -off was collected in MP -8, MP -12, MP -9, and MP -4. Duration of pulse above cut -off was not collected in MP -2. Clinical signs and symptoms were monitored, and more frequent readings were collected in cases where readings w ere above the pre-determined cut -off.

In PTSD studies, heart rate was temporarily elevated above 110 bpm was detected in 38% (36 of 95) of participants receiving MDMA in blinded dosing sessions , and heart rate never arose above threshold in placebo subjects. Heart rate was elevated above 110 BPM in 46% (36 of 78) of participants given 100 mg to 150 mg MDMA HCl in open - label sessions. The maximum heart rate for any subject receiving MDMA was 160 bpm. Values at end of session returned to pre -drug levels with no clinical intervention required. No clinically significant AEs were reported based on elevations in heart rate. In the MPVA -1 open -label study of CBCT combined with MDMA -assisted therapy in dyads, which comprised of a person diagnosed with PTSD and a significant other without PTSD, heart rate was recorded at baseline , midpoint, and at dosing session end. Heart rate was elevated by 15.8 to 19.6 BPM at session midpoint, prior to administering supplemental dose of MDMA, compared with baseline in participants with and without PTSD respectively. Mid -session HR was elevated compared with baseline in participants with and without PTSD. Heart rate remained above baseline at the end of the session. Th e highest value was 137 BPM, recorded at session midpoint in a PTSD participant. No extra readings were taken for any participant. No cardiac disorder AE was reported. In the MAPS sponsored Phase 3 PTSD study MAPP1, participants in the MDMA group had transient increases (on average 15 beats per minute) in heart rate during dosing sessions that decreased at the end of dosing sessions but were still slightly elevated above pre-dose levels . Participants in the placebo group showed a trend toward slightly decreased heat rate during dosing sessions that returned to pre -drug levels at the end of sessions. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 131 of 253 Table 29: Predose, Interim, and Endpoint Heart Rate (Beats Per Minute) Dosi ng Sessions in MAPP1 MDMA (N=44) Total (N=90) Dosing Session 1 Predose (n) study, peak heart rate increased ranging from 15 bpm after inactive placebo to 16.5 bpm after 125 mg MDMA HCl in blinded sessions, and from 13 to 23 bpm after open -label sessions. In most cases, heart rate had returned to baseline levels or near baseline levels, except after blinded 125 mg MDMA HCl , wher e average final reading remained 15.7 bpm greater than baseline . However, this dose group consisted of only three individuals. Heart rate above 110 bpm was detected in 25% (1 of 4) of participants given 125 mg MDMA HCl during blinded dosing sessions and in none of the participants receiving placebo during blinded dosing sessions or after open -label sessions with 75 mg to 125 mg MDMA HCl. The maximum heart rate for any subject receiving MDMA was 114 bpm. No clinical intervention was required during the study . No clinically significant AEs were reported based on elevations in heart rate (see Appendix Table 8 ). In MAPS -sponsored MDA -1, MDMA produced a greater increase in heart rate than inactive placebo during blinded and open -label sess ions. End of session heart rate was lower than peak value for all dose groups, with end of session heart rate at pre -drug levels after placebo and lower than peak value but at least 15.5 bpm higher than pre -drug levels after 125 mg MDMA HCl in blinded or op en-label sessions. Elevation in heart rate above threshold 120 bpm) was detected in 46.2% (6 of 13) of participants given 125 mg MDMA HCl during blinded dosing sessions and in none of the participants who received inactive placebo. Heart rate elevation abo ve cut off was MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 132 of 253 seen in 35.3% (6 of 17) of participants given 125 mg MDMA HCl during open -label dosing sessions . This study was comprised of a small sample, making comparisons with other samples or with healthy controls difficult. The maximum heart rate for any subject receiving MDMA was 140 bpm, observed after 125 mg MDMA HCl during an open -label session. No clinical interventions were required, and no clinically significant AEs were reported based on elevations in heart rate (see Appendix Table 9 ). Summary of Cardiovascular Effects The values presented above suggest a dose -dependent transient increase in SBP , heart rate and to a lesser extent DBP in participants in clinical trials that received MDMA , a finding that is supported in the literature in studies with healthy volunteers [11, 13, 14, 554]. Both highest peak and maximum duration above clinically important thresholds in cardiovascular parameters were observed in 125 mg MDMA HCl sessions. A comparison of participants receiving the supplemental dose to those who only received the initial dose in MP -1 indicate that the supplemental dose did not cause further elevation in BP and heart rate beyond the initial dose. On average, cardiovascular vital signs returned to baseline or near -baseline values by final reading, which is the case across all doses of MDMA. Blood pressure and pulse readings permitted the detection of the SAR of increased ventricular extrasystoles described in Section 6.4.1.5 Ser ious Adverse Reactions , but elevated blood pressure or pulse were not the cause of the event. There were far fewer observations of above threshold values of DBP than SBP. None of the participants have required treatment for sympathomimetic effects , and the y were self -limiting. 6.4.4 Cognition and Performance Acute effects on cognitive function were not assessed in sponsor -supported studies. In three MAPS -sponsored studies, MP -1, MP -4, and MP -12, long -term effects on cognitive function was assessed by administeri ng the Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), a relatively brief measure that assesses memory, attention and processing speed, visual -spatial and constructional abilities, and expressive language [679]; and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT), a measure of auditory processing speed and ment al flexibility [680, 681]. These instruments were given prior to and 1 to 2 months after therapy assisted with either full dose MDMA or a comparator/placebo dose. In MP -1, no significant differences in cognitive function were detected at the 2 -month Follow -up between subjects who received two sessions with 125 mg of MDMA HCl compared to participants who received placebo, as measured by RBANS and PASAT [41]. These findings suggest that MDMA did not impair cognitive function in this sample or that the effect was too small to attain statistical significance in this small pilot s tudy. Two completed studies (MP -12 and MP-4) included these measures to assess reproducibility of this finding. Available data pooled across studies are presented by dose in Table 30 and Table 31 . MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 133 of 253 Table 30: Neurocogni tive Function - RBANS Mean Total Scores at Baseline, Primary Endpoint, End of Stage 1, and End of Stage 2 for MP -1, MP -4, and MP -12 MDMA HCl Dose Baseline Mean (SD) Primary Endpoint Mean (SD) End of Stage 1 Mean (SD) End of Stage 2 Mean (SD) Placebo 100.9 (15.38) N=10 RBANS scores trended towards improvement after treatment with placebo and initial dose of 40 mg to 100 mg MDMA HCl, whereas scores stayed the same after treatment with initial dose of 125 mg MDMA HCl . The trend towards improvement could be a practice effect from repeated assessments, although stimuli were varied across these assessments, or could possibly be correlated with PTSD symptom reduction. One to three additional treatments with open -label active dose MDMA do not appear to worsen cognitive function based on preliminary End of Stage 1 and End of Stage 2 results. The statistical significance of these pooled findings is yet to be determined. Table 31: Neurocognitive Function - PASAT Trial 1 and Trial 2 Mean Raw Total Scores at Baseline, Primary Endpoint, End of Stage 1, and End of Stage 2 for MP -1, MP-4, and MP -12 PASAT Trial 1 MDMA HCl Dose Baseline Mean (SD) Primary Endpoint Mean (SD) End of Stage 1 Mean (SD) End of Stage 2 Mean (SD) Placebo (11.66) N=10 --- 42.5 (12.12) N=6 36.9 (11.12) N=14 --- On average, PASAT scores stayed about the same after treatment with placebo and 100 mg MDMA HCl and trended towards improvement after treatment with 40 mg and 125 mg MDMA HCl. The trend towards improvement could be a practice effect from repeated assessmen ts or could be correlated with PTSD symptom reduction. One to three additional treatments with open - label active dose MDMA do not appear to have worsened cognitive function and continued to trend towards improvement on average based on preliminary End of S tage 1 and End of Stage 2 results. Cognitive function tests such as the PASAT are also known to be subject to individual MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 134 of 253 variability, as they require basic proficiency with mathematical skills that are influenced by education level. The significance of the se pooled findings has yet to be determined, but it does not appear that MDMA -assisted therapy negatively impacted cognitive function. 6.4.5 Abuse Potential Subjective Effects MDMA produces anxiolytic and prosocial effects, which could counteract avoidance an d hyperarousal. These subjective effects of MDMA are hypothesized to create a desirable psychological state that enhances the therapeutic process in treating PTSD and other anxiety disorders. Findings using both subjective and objective indices of mood alt erations suggest that MDMA generates prosocial feelings and mental states in humans in controlled laboratory settings. These effects may also be associated with determining the abuse liability of MDMA. Subjective effects of moderate doses of MDMA in contro lled laboratory settings to healthy non - dependent volunteers, with a range of Ecstasy use history, have been reported in 28 publications summarized in a NIDA -funded review (N=657) [682]. These self -reporte d ratings include a broad range of mood states with relevance to social behavior. As presented in Table 32 , participants endorsed the following verbatim terms as VAS items: feeling loving, talkative, extroverted, sociable, self -confident, friendly, playful, open, trusting, close to other people, and emotionally concerned. MDMA's subjective prosocial effects may be enhanced in group settings when other individuals have also been administered MDMA in laboratory studies. Increased fee lings of loneliness may have resulted from testing conditions where participants receive MDMA in comparative isolation; however, these effects are not dependent on a permissive environment. From latent speech analysis and self -report data, \"want more drug\" ratings were predictive of prosocial effects, supporting this as the basis for moderate abuse liability of MDMA in healthy volunteers [682, 683]. A prospective pooled analysis of eight controlled non -sponsor supported cl inical studies was conducted in an overall sample of 139 healthy nondependent individuals (mean age 24.9, SD:4.1). In participants receiving 75 mg (N=29) or 125 mg MDMA HCl (N=110), subjective \"any drug ratings were significantly than regula r metabolizers (p<0.05) at 0.6 hours post-drug in poor metabolizers with CYP2D6 polymorphisms, which leads to 15% elevated C max of MDMA and 50% elevated Cmax of MDA. However, these effects were no longer significant at 1.5 hours post -drug.

In contrast, results were mixed with 0.25 to 0.75 mg/kg mCPP, with results varying from hallucinogen to stimulant to sedative depending on the dose. On the \"drug liking\" VAS, 1.6 mg/kg (p < 0.004) and 2.1 mg/kg MDMA HCl (p < 0.008) were significantly higher than placebo, whereas mCPP ratings were not significantly higher than placebo at any dose [633]. In another study in a sample of 74 largely drug -na\u00efve participants receiving MDMA in a controlled laboratory setting, Liechti and colleagues stated that \"no ne of the participants expressed any interest in taking MDMA as a recreational drug\" after receiving MDMA [15]. Collectively, these findings support the interpretation that MDMA received in controlled settings is inherently different than MDMA taken in recreational settings, and abuse liability of MDMA -assisted therapy should be evaluated in its intended setting and population for clinical use. Drug Discrimination and Stimulant Comparison The abuse liability of MDMA has bee n investigated in healthy volunteers utilizing a drug discrimination paradigm in two studies. The first study was in healthy nondependent volunteers with moderate MDMA experience (mean age 22.3) with a history of stimulant drug use (more than 6 times) and previous Ecstasy use (mean 14.5 times) comparing placebo, 10 mg and 20 mg d-amphetamine, 0.5 mg/kg and 0.75 mg/kg mCPP and 1.0 MDMA HCl a within -subject design (N=12). In this study, MDMA and d -amphetamine had similar reinforcing effects, and both were more than the effects of mCPP [16]. In humans trained to discriminate in a three -way procedure among 20 mg d -amphetamine, 0.75 mg/kg mCPP, and placebo, both 1.0 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg MDMA HCl was reported by half the participants to be like amphetamine and half like mCPP (N=22). Individuals who identified MDMA to be more like amphetamine were more sensitive to the subjective effects of all drugs, and they were more experienced with using Ecstasy and stimulants prior to the study [686]. Table 33 below presents a summary of studies with direct comparisons of MDMA vs. stimulants. Seven of ten studies found diff erences between MDMA vs. stimulants, with doses of 2.0 mg/kg MDMA HCl and higher having more similar effects to stimulants.

The study was in healthy non -dependent volunteers (mean age 29.3, SD:50) with current stimulant (4.2 days/month) and Ecstasy use (2.1 days/month). Both drugs had a similar time course of effects with oral administration. Plasma levels peaked at 3 hours and declined over the 24 -hour period post -administration, with minor levels of drug remaining above baseline in plasma at the end of this period. Both drugs enhanced cardiovascular parameters, ratings of stimulation, euphoria, and mood, and decreased food intake. Methamphetamine, but not MDMA, caused significant residual pulse and DBP elevation at the end of the 24 -hour period (p<0.01). MDMA did not enhance performance, indicating the absence of this contributor to reinforcing effects, in contrast to metha mphetamine. Methamphetamine produced primarily positive effects (Good Drug Effect, Stimulated, Desire to Take Again, Drug Liking), whereas MDMA had some positive (Good Drug Effect, Stimulated) and some negative effects (Bad Drug Effect, Can't Concentrate, Tired, Sleepy). Only methamphetamine disrupted sleep, objectively measured via Actigraphy, and increased tiredness. MDMA did not disturb sleep, and instead facilitated ability to more readily fall asleep. As most participants were unable to correctly ident ify the drug received, and important confound is that experienced Ecstasy users may have based their opinions about MDMA on material of low purity and unknown dose. The sponsor has been given permission to access primary data for this study under IND #0740 39. Taken together, these observations and other studies support distinct differences in subjective and reinforcing effects, supporting a lower abuse liability for MDMA than stimulants. 8/ Johanson et al. 2006 1.0 mg/kg, 1.5 mg/kg VAS Friendly d-Amph 20 mg VAS Friendly 11/ Kirkpatrick et al. 2012 [39] 2.1 (1.8) per month 29.3 (50) 100 mg VAS Social, Talkative Meth 20 mg 40 mg 20 mg VAS Social 40 mg VAS Social, Talkative 30/ Schmid et al. 2014 [605] 5 24.0 (4.2) 75 mg MET Emotional empathy for positive situations recognition: sadness Methylph 40 mg No effect on emotional empathy for positive situations or recognition of sadness 12/ Tancer, Johanson 2003 [16] 14.5B 22.3B 1.0 2.0 mg/kg VAS Friendly, Social, Talkative d-amph 10 mg, 20 mg 20 mg VAS Friendly 30/ Schmid et al. 2015 [687] 5 24.0 (4.2) 75 mg No effect on ratings of erotic images Meth 40 mg ratings of erotic images 11/Marrone et al. 2010 [688] 100 mg No effect on speech quantity fluency Meth 20 mg 40 mg speech quantity, fluency MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 141 of 253 Prevalence of Dependence There have been no reports of MDMA depend ence developing after participation in controlled MDMA studies. In the absence of drug dependence studies on MDMA, a summary of Ecstasy dependence studies is presented. Ecstasy is purported to contain MDMA, but in the majority of pills submitted for anonym ous testing, no MDMA is found and/or impurities abound. Some adulterants, such as amphetamines, that are commonly found in Ecstasy tablets may be responsible for the dependence and cravings associated with Ecstasy [689]. Research of Ecstasy dependence comes from a combination of published studies wi th assessment of symptoms based on the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, the DSM -4, and/or the Severity of Dependence Scale [690]. One study with a non -representative sample (N= 173) including participants recruited from substance abuse programs reported 30% had used Ecstasy and of these, 43% met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV ( DSM -IV) criteria for dependence (N=52) [691]. In a large Australian sample (N=329), approximately 25% of polydrug users wanted to red uce their Ecstasy use and 20% had received treatment for an Ecstasy -related problem, although this sample likely had \"an over -representation of chaotic intravenous polydrug users [692]. In a study of self -reported cravings in Ecstasy users utilizing an 8 -item questionnaire (N=169), a negative mean score for participants exposed to Ecstasy -related cues was obtained, indicating that participants disagreed with statements reflecting craving on average. In a subscale analysis, about 50% of survey participants agreed on some leve l with two of eight statements that supported the craving to use Ecstasy after exposure to Ecstasy -related cues, suggesting that some respondents may experience a low level of craving for Ecstasy [689]. It also appears that Ecstasy has fewer or less intensely rewarding effects than stimulants, and e ven heavy Ecstasy users fail to report the intensive patterns of use seen with other stimulants [193, 314, 693]. Based on two structural analyses, Ecstasy dependence is bifactorial [694]. Although Ecstasy dependence does have a compulsive use factor as well as an escalating use factor, withdrawal symptoms do not include significant physical symptoms such as those occurring with alcohol, cocaine, methamphe tamine, opioids, and tobacco [695, 696]. In a prospective longitudinal study conducted over an average of 42 months in a representative sample of Munich residents aged 14 to 24 (N=2446), only 1.0% were diagnosed with Ecstasy abuse and 0.6% with dependence. A substantial decline in use factors was noted 12+ months later, suggesting that Ecstasy use is a self -limiting transient phenomenon in many cases [697]. Features of Ecstasy abuse and dependence in healthy human volunteers are consistent with nonclinical findings in self -administrat ion studies of moderate abuse liability that is greater than that for serotonergic hallucinogens, but less than that for stimulants ( see Section 4 .3.6.3 Abuse Potential ). When reviewing the effects of MDMA in a sample of 74 largely drug -na\u00efve participants in a study conducted outside of sponsor support, Liechti and colleagues stated that \"none of the participants expressed any interest in taking MDMA as a recreational drug\" after receiving MDMA in a controlled research setting [15]. When assessed in terms of willingness to choose money over receiving the drug, participants previously experienced with Ecstasy provided similar responses to 2 mg/k g MDMA HCl and 20 mg d -amphetamine, a sign of having reinforcing effects [633]. A study that enrolled participants with a history of Ecstasy use (4 to 40 occasions) found that only self -reported feelings of playfulness were associated with participants' desire to take MDMA in a control led research setting [29]. In addition to the extensive published clinical and nonclinical literature on the abuse liability potential associated with MDMA, the sponsor has collected self -reported Ecstasy use data at long-term follow -up and assessed the AEs for signals of abuse. At screening participants who met MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 142 of 253 DSM -4 criteria for active substance abuse for 60 days prior to enrollment were excluded from participation in all but one study, where active substance abuse for 180 days prior to en rollment was excluded (MP -4). Participants who had used Ecstasy more than five times within the past 10 years prior to enrollment were also excluded. As a part of the Informed Consent process, study staff informed participants about the difference between Ecstasy and MDMA used in research studies. Table 34 below summarizes self -reported Ecstasy use data (recreational drug purported to be MDMA, unknown purity and dose) pre -study at least 6 months prior to study entry vs. long - term fol low-up at 12+ months in Phase 2 PTSD clinical trials. Participants were encouraged to report use honestly under coverage of a Certificate of Confidentiality from FDA.

In sponsor -supported Phase 2 PTSD studies in 107 participants treated with MDMA -assisted therapy in a controlled clinical setting, 29.9% (32 of 107) of participants had tried Ecstasy at least 6 months prior to enrollment, with U.S. samples demonstrating a hig her prevalence of use than international studies. Participants reported using Ecstasy an average (SD) of 2.3 (1.43) times pre - study at least 6 months prior the study. At long -term follow -up, 8.6% of participants (8 of 93) reported use across studies . Six o f the eight participants had used Ecstasy prior to the study. Of these participants, most were attempting to recreate a therapeutic experience, and none indicated a desire to repeat this. In addition to self -report data, urine drug screens specific for MDM A were performed at random and two, six and 12 months after the final dosing session during one study (MP-2, N=12). All were negative, supporting the observation that study participants did not seek out MDMA or Ecstasy after taking part in the study [42]. In the sponsor -supported Phase 3 PTSD study MAPP1, 32.2% (29 of 90) reported prior Ecstasy use, mirroring the overall rate seen in the Phase 2 studies. Reported history of Ecstasy use within ten years prior to participation in MAPP1 MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 143 of 253 was equal between MDMA and pla cebo groups. Additional data will be collected on post -study use in a long -term follow up study. In addition to data on Ecstasy use at follow -up, AEs were reviewed for clinically significant AEs indicating abuse potential across all Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies. There were no AEs were reported supporting the terms \"drug dependence\", \"intentional drug misuse,\" or \"substance abuse .\" In the context of therapy, MDMA does not exhibit signals tha t would suggest abuse potential. For example, t here were no more than two 2 AEs reported in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies (< 2%) which included AE terms reflecting acute intoxication (hypnapompic and hypnagogic hallucinations) . These were both reported by the same PTSD participant the day after the final open label 125 mg MDMA HCl dosing session , were rated as mild and resolved within 24 hours with no treatment . There were 3 subjects in the Phase 3 study, MAPP1 who reported AEs of substance use (cannabis) in the MDMA group (see Table 1 3). Of note, the MAPP1 study included participants with mild or moderate in early remission cannabis and alcohol use disorder. One AE of drug abuse was reported in study MDA -1 in a population with anxiety associated with life-threatening illness. This AE referred to a single nondependent use of a hallucinogen, which MedDRA coding places under the preferred term drug abuse but does not in dicate a substance use disorder. Data drawn from sponsor -supported studies suggests that MDMA has low abuse liability when given within a controlled, psychotherapeutic setting. Conclusion s on Safety of MDMA Safety data from studies in controlled resear ch settings and clinical trials show that MDMA produces sympathomimetic effects that include statistically significant, self -limiting increases in body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure that are likely to be transient and well tolerated by health y individuals [11, 13-15, 36-42, 78, 79, 232, 549] and patients with PTSD and other indications in which MDMA -assiste d therapy has been studied . Risks posed by elevated blood pressure are addressed in clinical trials by excluding candidates with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease or with pre -existing uncontrolled hypertension and by monitoring blood pressure and pulse during M DMA -assisted dosing sessions . The most common treatment - emergent adverse events more prevalent in the MDMA group from blinded, placebo -controlled Phase 3 study data were muscle tightness, decreased appetite, nausea, hyperhidrosis , feeling cold , restlessnes s, mydriasis, dizziness nystagmus, blood pressure increased, feeling jittery, non -cardiac chest pain, dry mouth, vision blurred, pollakiuria, intrusive thoughts, vomiting, stress, musculoskeletal pain , pyrexia, chills, substance use, mic turition urgency, muscle twitching, somnolence, and nervousness. Common anxiety -related psychiatric symptoms were reported equally in both the MDMA and placebo arms in the Phase 3 trial. Reactions were transient and diminish ed as drug effects wane d during treatment sessions and over a next 24 -hour period . No increase in suicidality , cardiovascular, or abuse potential AESIs were observed in MDMA participants in the placebo -controlled Phase 3 study MAPP1. In studies conducted with and without sponsor support in controlled clinical settings, with individuals exposed to MDMA, there have been no published or reported unexpected SARs to date and expected SARs have been rare and non -life threatening. To date, o ne subject experienced an expected SAR (increased ventr icular extrasystoles, reported in Study MP -8) in MAPS -sponsored clinical trials. SUSARS occur infrequently in the program and the sponsor is monitoring any SUSARs and once definitive information is available to determine if any SUSARs should be upgrade to SARs, the IB will be updated with this information. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 144 of 253 7.0 Summary of Data and Guidance for the Investigator MDMA is a psychoactive compound that affects mood, perception, and increases prosocial feelings. The sponsor is investigating use of this compound as an adjunct to therapy for treating PTSD, anxiety , and eating disorders . Researchers with and without sponsor support have conducted non -clinical and clinical studies with MDMA, and is currently in late-stage clinical development for a PTSD indication with a pivotal Phase 3 trial completed and a confirmatory trial ongoing. Currently, MDMA is listed as a Schedule I controlled substance in the U.S. and is not permitted for medical use outside of approved research settings . Psychotherapists in the U.S. began to use MDMA as an adjunct to therapy in the mid to late 1970s, and narrative accounts describe therapeutic use with an estimated 500,000 doses of MDMA administered during therapy sessions in North America prior to its s cheduling [46, 312]. As of October 01, 2021 , MDMA has been administered to 358 participants in MAPS' Clinical D evelopment Program and at least 1,441 individuals reported in the scientific literature, for a total of 1,799 research participants who have been exposed to MDMA in clinical research studies conducted with or without sponsor support . These studies have demonstrated that MDMA can be safely administered to people with PTSD and other indications in a controlled clinical setting. MDMA is responsible fo r a series of dose dependent physiological effects due to enhanced neurochemical release of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, and for indirect effects on hormone secretion, including oxytocin and AVP, which act on different target organs to modulate physiological functions in the body. MDMA is contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular conditions where an acute increase in blood pressure may pose a significant clinical concern, such as aneurysmal vascular disease (including th oracic and abdominal aorta, intracranial, and peripheral arterial vessels), arteriovenous malformation, or acute stroke or recent history of intracerebral hemorrhage and during or within 14 days following the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI). The elevation of blood pressure and increased heart rate produced by MDMA, like that produced by other sympathomimetic drugs, can lead to increased risk in people with pre -existing medical conditions . In comparison to anxiolytics, antidepressants , and atypical antipsychotics, MDMA does not require steady state levels in the blood to function as a catalyst to therapy with rapid onset in some participants. A limited number of single divided -dose exposures to MDMA, spaced approximately 1 month apart in the therapeutically active dose range , are sufficient to obtain therapeutic outcomes. This intermittent dosing mitigates AE frequency and improves the risk/benefit ratio of MDMA, which may provide a significant advantage over medications that require da ily dosing. Based on the current state of scientific knowledge and the risk/benefit profile of therapeutic doses of MDMA, MAPS concludes that it appears favorable to continue the clinical development of MDMA as a medicine used as an adjunct to therapy . 7.1 Pharmacology The pharmacology of MDMA is complex ; it activates multiple signaling cascades in the body. The current formulation consists of fixed doses in HPMC capsules of 40 and 60 mg MDMA HCl (as the hydrochloride salt) with the excipients mannitol and magnesium stearate . There is a placebo to match . Due to a wide range of responses to identical mg/kg dosing between individuals, possibly as a result of inconsistent relationship between body weight and pharmacodynamic activity, the sponsor's human trials use initial doses between approximately 1 and 4 mg/kg MDMA (active doses range from 75 to 125 mg, with divided -dose 112.5mg to 187.5 mg, assuming a 70 kg individual ,) to achieve a more consistent response between participants. The clinical dos e tested in Phase 3 trials is a divided dose of 120 mg is administered in the first dosing session (initial dose of 80 mg + supplemental dose of 40 mg) and a divided dose of 180 MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 145 of 253 mg (120 mg initial + 60 mg supplemental ) is administered in the second and third dosing sessions . The supplemental dose and/or dose escalation can be withheld if the initial dose is not tolerated or the participant declines. In humans, onset of MDMA effects occurs approximately 30 to 60 minutes after initial administration, peak effects occur 75 to 120 minutes after administration and d uration of effects lasts 3 to 6 hours [11, 12, 14, 15, 17]. In a repeated dose study, an initial dose of 50 mg MDMA HCl, followed two hours later by a second dose of 100 mg MDMA HCl, does not significantly extend the duration of measurable physiological or subjective effects in comparison to a single dose of 100 mg MDMA HCl [265]. The pharmacokinetic properties of MDMA in humans have been characterized using initial oral doses up to 150 mg MDMA HCl in humans. MDMA disposition in the body follows nonlinear pharmacokinetics. MDMA i s metabolized in the liver by several enzymes. Active doses of MDMA may autoinhibit CYP2D6 function for an extended period, with function normalizing up to 10 days post -MDMA. The enzymes CYP1A2, COMT, and MAO -A are also involved in the metabolism of MDMA. MDMA is metabolized by N -demethylation to MDA. The parent compound and its active metabolite MDA are further O -demethylated to HHMA and HHA, respectively. Both HHMA and HHA are subsequently O -methylated mainly to HMMA and HMA. These four metabolites, parti cularly HMMA and HMA, are known to be excreted in the urine as conjugated glucuronide or sulfate metabolites. The elimination half -life of active MDMA doses is 7 to 9 hours. The end of systemic exposure is within 48 hours post-dose [253]. MDMA is a triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor, which concomitantly promotes carrier - mediated release, inhibits reuptake, and extends duration of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in synaptic noradrenergic, and dopaminergic neurotransmission. Additionally, MDMA appears to alter the conformation of the transporters, enabling monoamines to diffuse out of the neuron rather than being actively transported into the presynaptic neuron. MDMA was found to compete with monoamines for sites on the VMAT2 , suggesting MDMA also promotes active release of monoamines from vesicular stores, in addition to inhibiting reuptake. MDMA extends the presence of monoamines in the synaptic cleft by inhibiting MAO -A, an enzyme that breaks down monoamines in the synapse. MDMA has self - limiting subjective and physiological effects. Co -administration with an SSRI or SNRI may eliminate or attenuate the effects of MDMA , and these medications should be tapered in line with the investigator's clinical judgment and an approved s tudy protocol. Brain imaging studies report that MDMA has been shown to acutely decrease s activity in the left amygdala and increase activity in the prefrontal cortex . The chief mechanism behind its therapeutic effects is likely to be serotonergic, along with some norepinephrine and to a minor extent dopamine -mediated effect. Indirect, but potentially significant effects of MDMA include association with release or elevated levels of the hormones cortisol, oxytocin, prolactin, and AVP. MDMA likely stimulates secretion blood indirect activation of 5HT 1A, 5HT 2C, and 5HT 4 receptor subtypes, as as AVP secretion via activation of 5HT 2C, 5HT 4, and 5HT 7 receptor subtypes. Both oxytocin and AVP are implicated in the widespread regulation of behavioral aspects of mood and act on different target organs to modulate physiological functions in the body. Taken together, MDMA has a diverse array of pharmacodynamic effects in animals and humans. 7.2 Toxicology The toxic ity of MDMA has been investigated in numerous animal and in vitro studies published in peer -reviewed journals. Intravenous MDMA doses that cause lethality in 50% of the cases, known as the LD 50, are 97 mg/kg in mice, 49 mg/kg in rats, 14 to 18 mg/kg in dog s, and 22 mg/kg in monkeys. LD 50 varies between different strains of the same animal species, across the sexes, MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 146 of 253 housing conditions, environmental conditions, social interactions with cohabiting animals, exercise levels, and water supply. Translation of the se doses to human -equivalent doses should be undertaken with caution due to known non -linear ity in pharmacokinetic s that appear in a dose dependent manner . Exposure -based endpoints are more reliable than simple dose conversions based on body surface area. MDMA appears to alter regulation of serotonergic signaling in the rat brain without producing damage to serotonin axons, based on transient reductions in forebrain (striatum, hippocampus, and cortex) serotonin and SERT protein absence of indicators of CNS neuronal injury/degeneration [75]. MAPS -sponsored definitive GLP follow -up Extended Single -Dose Neurotoxicology studies in the rat and the dog were conducted to conclusively study neurotoxicity with modern experimental methods . Both studies did not find MDMA -related evidence of CNS neurotoxicity based on expanded neurohistopathology through the MTD. In the rat study, m icroscopic findings included degeneration of myofibers in skeletal muscle associated with infiltration of mononuc lear leukocytes or neutrophils at 25 mg/kg/dose (MTD) one day post dosing . Within 7 days after the last repeated dose, these effects were associated with some level of repair or adaption. On this basis, the risk of CNS neurotoxicity with the intended clini cal dosing regimen appears to be minimal , with low risk of transient adverse effects in myofibers of skeletal muscle in the peripher y. MDMA has minimal risk of QTc interval prolongation based on a definitive hERG stud y which found an IC 50 of 206 \u00b5M with a 170-fold ratio over the expected unbound MDMA plasma concentration in the clinical exposure scenario. There was no effect of the oral administration of MDMA on qualitative or quantitative ECG parameters in an in vivo dog cardiovascular study. MDMA has no significant effects on respiratory rate or blood oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry. MDMA has been demonstrated to be negative for genotoxic ity. Consistent with this, despite very high doses of MDMA being tested in preclinical studies, none have reported carcinogenic effects. Rodent fertility, reproductive, and developmental toxicity studies with MDMA have generally found no abnormalities in gest ational duration, neonatal birth weights, or physical appearance when exposure occurs during organogenesis through lactation. Repeated dose toxicity studies of adequate duration, fertility, early embryonic development, and embryofetal development studies of MDMA have been completed. Studies in rats and rabbits have not shown direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. These studies established the NOAEL dose to be the highest dose level evaluated at 10 mg/kg/day (supratherapeu tic dose) in both sexes of the rat for fertility, reproductive performance, and for maternal and developmental toxicity in the rabbit. The NOAEL dose was the highest dose level evaluated at 15 mg/kg/day (supratherapeutic dose) for maternal and development al toxicity in the rat. 7.3 Safety in Humans 7.3.1 Adverse Events Overall, adverse effects of MDMA were modest and generally have not been associated with serious discomfort in healthy volunteers or in subjects in MAPS -sponsored Phase 2 or Phase 3 studies with PTS D and other indications . Risks posed by sympathomimetic effects of MDMA treatments are addressed in MAPS' clinical trials by excluding people with pre -existing cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease or uncontrolled hypertension, and by monitoring blood pressure, body temperature, and pulse. Common reactions reported in clinical trials were transient and diminish ed as drug effects wane d during the MDMA -assisted session and over the MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 147 of 253 next 24 hours. Once the drug is fully clear ed from the body within 4 8 hours post -dose, most reactions diminish within 3 -4 days post -dose. In Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies, a subset of AEs were collected as spontaneously reported reactions in participants receiving a therapeutically active dose of MDMA: dry mouth, diarrhea, heavy legs, impaired judgement, and nystagmus. AEs that did not resolve within 7 days post -dose and were reported in 10% of participants in the active MDMA dose groups included: anxiety, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, increased irritability, insomnia, and low mood. The amount of placebo data in these studies precludes thorough separation of background events from reactions to MDMA. In the Phase 3 study MAPP1, the most common related treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) repo rted more frequently in the MDMA group were muscle tightness (63.0% MDMA vs 11.4% placebo), appetite 6.8% placebo). No SAEs, AESIs suggestive of abuse potential, or AESIs involving cardiac function that could be indicative of QT interval prolongation or cardiac arrhythmias were reported in subjects who were randomized to the MDMA group in the Phase 3 stu dy MAPP1 (n=46 of 90 treated). Three participants randomized to MDMA vs. five participants randomized to placebo reported AESIs of self -injurious behavior or suicidality (See Section 7.3.2 Suicidal Ideation and Behavior). Overall, the risks of SARs have b een addressed and constrained by limited exposure and drug administration in controlled settings with adequate screening according to eligibility criteria defined in study protocols. To date, only one SAR (exacerbation of pre -existing ventricular extrasyst oles) has been reported within the context of MAPS -sponsored clinical studies. The possibly drug -related expected of exacerbation of pre -existing ventricular extrasystoles occurred during open -label treatment with 125 mg MDMA HCl (supplemental dose was wit hheld) , which resolved with full recovery to baseline after the effects of MDMA ceased. The subject was hospitalized for observation and recovered fully after the event, with no cardiac damage. 7.3.2 Suicidal Ideation and Behavior There is high incidence of suicidal ideation and behavior in populations of people with PTSD, especially those suffering from chronic PTSD. To determine if suicidal ideation and behavior worsens or improves after treatment in MAPS -sponsored trials, the C -SSRS is administered repeatedly throughout MAPS sponsored clinical trials. Due to the nature of the therapeutic method, wherein a person may re -experience emotions associated with the traumatic event in order to reprocess the memory in a new, therapeutic w ay, thoughts of ending one's life may surface during this process. In MAPS -sponsored clinical trials C -SSRS scores have escalated during the Preparatory Sessions (before any drug administration), which is thought to be a result of preparatory discussion of traumatic experiences, and/or of participants tapering off long - prescribed medications, such as SSRIs and benzodiazepines. Withdrawal of these medications is known to induce suicidal ideation or behavior in some people. During both non -drug and MDMA -assis ted therapy sessions, participants are asked to think about and discuss their experiences, thoughts, and emotions related to their condition. They may experience intense emotional responses to recalling and speaking about this material. As MDMA is only administered in combination with therapy , the distress associated with therapy is unavoidable and is considered a necessary part of the therapeutic process that requires proper facilitation and support from therapists. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 148 of 253 Overall , the incidence of serious suic idal ideation or behavior in sponsor -supported studies was low, occurring in only a few participants post -MDMA treatment and an equivalent number of participants either prior to dosing or after therapy with placebo , and returning to lower scores while participants were closely monitored. As of March 01, 2022 , three participants reported SAEs of suicidality (suicidal ideation and/or behavior) after receiving MDMA in MAPS - supported Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies. All wer e deemed unrelated to MDMA in the opinion of the investigator and sponsor . Of interest, th ree participants reported SAEs of suicidality either prior to receiving study drug (n=1, Study MP -2), or after receiving placebo (n= 2, Study MAPP1). In aggregate , the comparable incidence across groups demonstrates that t hese SAE s remain unexpected for MDMA and the underlying disease present s an alternative explanation for these SAEs. In the placebo -controlled Phase 3 trial MAPP1, suicidal ity as measured by C -SSRS a nd reported as AE, occurred with equal prevalence in both study arms; the prevalence was not greater in the MDMA arm of the study s. There were no reports of positive suicidal ideation or behavior after the first dosing session in participants with a life -threatening illness and only few incidences, none serious, of positive ideation in adults on the autism spectrum during the study. Therapy teams minimize risks by carefully evaluating all participants to determine if there is a current risk of suicidal behavior. Participants with a history of suicide attempts are not excluded unless significant risk of suicidal behavior is present at the time of Screening. When positive serious ideation or behavior occurred after study enrollment, the investigators made follow -up observations of C -SSRS to ensure subject safety and tracked scores until they returned to non - serious levels. This risk is i mportant to monitor due to the high prevalence of background events in the psychiatric population. 7.3.3 Immunological Effects Humans exhibit transient immunological changes after a dose of 100 mg, including reduced numbers of CD4 cells, increased numbers of N K cells, and an increase in levels of immunosuppressive and anti -inflammatory cytokines compared with levels of pro -inflammatory and immunostimulating cytokines. In several respects, these effects are similar to those that occur with other psychoactive sub stances, so are not unique to MDMA. Immunological effects last for approximately 24 hours after administration, and most arise indirectly from serotonin release. The significance of these immunological effects remains unclear. Based on results from trials conducted by the sponsor to date , the impact of these effects is expected to be modest . Further evaluation in the placebo -controlled Phase 3 study MAPP1 did not demonstrate an increase in upper respiratory tract infections in the MDMA group compared to the placebo group (see Section 6.4.1.3 Adverse Events Summary ). 7.3.4 Hepatic Effects and Other Laboratory Values Phase 1 studies conducted outside of sponsor support involving administration of MDMA to healthy volunteers have not r eported any results of liver function after MDMA administration, and a recent published examination of safety data in a pooled sample of healthy participants found no changes in hepatic function assessed via standard liver panel. There have been no reporte d adverse effects on the liver from these studies. The first two sponsor -supported Phase 2 studies (MP -1, MP -2) assessed clinical lab values for safety after completion of two or three dosing sessions . On average, n o clinically or statistically significant changes in ALT, as a measure of liver function , occurred in MP -1. All post-treatment v alues for laboratory tests were within the normal range in MP -1. No MDMA -related AEs related to liver function have been reporte d in subsequent sponsor -supported studies. Only one participant in the MP -2 study MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 149 of 253 reported a clinically significant hepatic abnormalities, likely due to hereditary factors. The other observed laboratory value (increased ESR) indicated inflammation in a sub ject with a medical history of breast cancer 3 months after the last administration of MDMA as an unrelated AE. Hepatic function one month post -MDMA was assessed in nine independent published safety pharmacology clinical trials that were published in a poo led analysis (N=16 4) [232]. These studies found one significant change found in -glutamyl transpeptid ase (p<0.01). There w ere no significant change s in creatinine, GFR, ALT or AST . These results support that on average, MDMA does not influence hepatobiliary function in most people, however there is evidence of a rare idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity. 7.4 Risk Assessment and Mitigation Study procedures and eligibility criteria have been developed based on Phase 2 and Phase 3 PTSD trials which exclude potential participants with pre -existing exclusionary medical conditions that would exacerbate risk. The the rapy teams and site physicians are available via telephone throughout the study if any problem occurs when a participant is not at the site. In the event of a medical emergency or any other medical problem during a dosing session , the site physician should be immediately available by telephone, and based on assessment of the situation, they should make the decision to either evaluate the participant themselves at the site or arrange for transfer of the participant to the Emergency Department. Risk mitigati on procedures are described by risk category below. Risk Categories were determined by review of possible risks within the Risk Assessment and Categorization Tool (RACT). 7.4.1 High Level Risks High Risk does not indicate an event is more likely to happen but indicates per the RACT assessment that new and or more complex procedures are required in the study to ensure screening is adequate to eliminate or manage the risk in the patient population. No high -level risks of MDMA have been identified based on the RAC T assessment. 7.4.2 Medium Level Risks Medium Risk does not indicate the likelihood the event will occur but indicates per the RACT assessment that new or many procedures, which are not complex, are needed to ensure screening is adequate to eliminate or manage the risk in the patient population. Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Risks and Mitigation MDMA is known to transiently increase heart rate and blood pressure in a dose -dependent manner that is generally not problematic for physically healthy ind ividuals. These changes typically last no more than 6 hours. Participants with PTSD in MAPS -sponsored Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies do not appear to differ from healthy individuals in this sympathomimetic, physiological response. Most people do not experienc e elevations in cardiovascular parameters that exceed those seen after moderate exercise. An examination of safety data drawn from Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies of MDMA -assisted therapy detected a dose -dependent increase in SBP and to a lesser exten t DBP. Ch aracterization of sympathomimetic effects among participants with controlled hypertension is ongoing. MDMA is unlikely to increase risk of QTc interval prolongation based on a definitive hERG study and had no effect on qualitative or quantitative ECG param eters in an in vivo dog cardiovascular study. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 150 of 253 Risks posed by elevated blood pressure are addressed by excluding people with pre -existing uncontrolled hypertension and monitoring blood pressure and pulse, as described in study protocols. Before and after drug administration in dosing sessions , the therapy teams monitor vital signs. The therapy team should attend to clinical signs and symptoms of potential rare complications of the cardiovascular effects of MDMA, such as stroke or acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during dosing sessions . Any symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, neurological deficit or confusion other potential indicators of end organ effects of hypertension should prompt additional vital sign measurements and intervene if appropriate. Therapy teams should notify the site physician if this occurs for evaluation. If a ny participant has neurological deficits, as assessed by the site physician, whether or not they are associated with hypertensive crisis, they should be monitored as described above and transported to the hospital if medically indicated . If evaluation at t he hospital reveals an acute ischemic stroke, there should be sufficient time to administer recombinant tissue plasminogen within the 3 -hour time frame recommended in the 2019 American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) guidelines [698]. If a participant experiences ischemic type chest pain, whether or not it is associated wit h hypertensive crisis, the study physician should be contacted immediately, and the participant should be taken to an emergency room by ambulance as expeditiously as possible to assess the patient and act in accordance with the assessment of the expert on site supported by national and local/AHA and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines. Pending tra nsport to the hospital the site team may take any measures ordered by the site physician including administering medication such as aspirin or nitroglycerin or providing supplemental oxygen per local standards. If further evaluation at the hospital reveals that the participant has had an AMI, they should be well within the time frame required for definitive therapy. Any participant who experiences such medical complications during a dosing session should not be given another dosing session . QT interval ma y be evaluated in the event of hospitalization for management of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular event. If at any time a participant develops a QT/QTc F interval >450 ms or of >30 ms over baseline during ECG evaluation, the participant should be discontin ued from treatment. Psychological Risks and Mitigation A medium -level risk of exacerbation of psychological distress exists in participants with a psychiatric diagnosis. Data in PTSD patients from the sponsor's Phase 3 clinical trial (MAPP1) indicate TE AEs related to psychological distress were similarly reported across both groups of blinded participants: anxiety ( 32.6% MDMA, vs 40.9% placebo), and suicidal ideation (45.7% MDMA vs 47.7% placebo). These common ly reported AEs were observed in both treatment arms, transient in duration, mild to moderate in severity, and also overlap with background events associated with PTSD, which might have influenced the frequency of events observed during clinical trials of MDMA -assisted therapy. While these data do not support that psychological distress is a specific risk of MDMA, psychological distress may be exacerbated in participants with moderate to severe PTSD following the onset of MDMA effects until the last effects have dissipated. In clinical studies, these symptoms , which may occur in participants receiving MDMA or placebo, have been self -limiting and have responded well to reassurance from the therapy te am, with occasional use of benzodiazepines for anxiety. During these studies, participants have the intention of confronting and working through traumatic experiences. Accordingly, signs of MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 151 of 253 psychological distress, panic, or other unpleasant psychological r eactions are to be expected and may be considered an element of the psychotherapeutic process. Proper preparation and follow -up support will reduce the difficulties participants might have with acute or sub -acute reactions. The potential for destabilizin g psychological distress will be minimized by: Excluding people who might be more vulnerable to it (such as people diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder type 1 or with psychotic disorders) . Preparatory Session s of non -drug therapy before the dosing session . Creating an atmosphere of trust during the dosing session . Close monitoring . Phone contact with participants during the week after the dosing session . Integrative Session s. If deemed necessary, o vernight stay at the study site f or the night of each dosing session for PTSD studies. If this occurs, q ualified personnel will be available during the overnight stay to respond to the needs of the participant. Attendants will be instructed to contact the therapy team upon request or at t he appearance of signs of a potential SAE. During the Preparatory Session s, participants should be made aware of the fact that difficult emotions, including grief, rage, fear, or panic, may arise during dosing sessions . Every effort should be made to help participants resolve difficult symptoms and to arrive at a more comfortable and relaxed state by the conclusion of the dosing session , including empathic listening on the part of the therapy team and performance of diaphragmatic breathing b y participants. Although unexpected, i f the participant is severely agitated, anxious, in danger of self -harm or suicide, or is experiencing any other severe psychological distress, at the end of a therapy session, at least one member of the therapy team remains with the participant for at least 2 more hours. During this time, the therapy team employs affect management techniques, talks with the participant to help them gain cognitive perspective of their experiences, and helps the participant implement t he self -soothing and stress inoculation techniques presented during the Preparatory Session s. If the participant remains severely anxious, agitated, in danger of self -harm or suicide, or is otherwise psychologically unstable at the end of the 2 -hour stabil ization period, the site physician and therapy team decide between the following options: 1. If severe distress occurs at the end of a dosing session , a nurse, therapeutic assistant, physician, or therapy team member should stay with the participant until th e severe distress resolves or until the time of their Integrative Session appointment the following morning. The therapy team should then meet with the participant daily until the period of destabilization has passed. 2. If the participant experiences severe , persisting emotional distress, such as panic attacks, severe generalized anxiety, or insomnia following a dosing session , the site physician may prescribe a benzodiazepine (specifically, lorazepam) and/or sleep aid (e.g., zolpidem). The site physician sh ould not prescribe an SSRI, SNRI, or MAOI in this context, unless it has been determined that the participant will be withdrawn from the study. Residual symptoms would be addressed during the frequent follow -up therapy visits with the therapy team. 3. If a pa rticipant should become psychotic, arrangements should be made to stabilize them or transfer them to the Emergency Department (ED) if hospitalization is necessary. If any participant is hospitalized after a severe psychological reaction they would be suspe nded MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 152 of 253 from the protocol until after recovery or stabilization, at which time the investigator and/or site physician would carefully evaluate the participant's emotional status. For those participants engaged in an ongoing therapeutic relationship with a p sychotherapist or psychiatrist, the participant's outside therapist(s) should be involved in the management of any psychiatric complications. For those participants engaged in an ongoing psychotherapeutic relationship with the investigator or member of the therapy team, the management of any psychiatric complications should be undertaken by them in their capacity as the participant's therapist. 7.4.3 Low Level Risks Low Level Risk does not indicate the likelihood the event will occur but indicates per the RACT assessment that no new or complex procedures are needed to ensure screening is adequate to eliminate or manage the risk in the patient population. Thermoregulatory Risks and Mitigation MDMA administered in a controlled setting produces only a slight increase in body temperature [15]. Ambient temperature does not enhance or attenuate this slight elevation in humans. In data gathered from sponsor -supported Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies, it was found that compared to placebo, a higher percentage of participants receiving MDMA had peak body temperatures greater than 1\u00b0C above baseline. However, there was no strong relationship between dose of MDMA and peak body temperature or between MDMA dose and elevation above threshold of 1\u00b0C above baseline. Ambient temperature should be kept at a comfortable level during dosing sessions . If temperature rises more than 1\u00b0C or the participant states th at they feel hot, attempts should be made to decrease body temperature and increase comfort by removing blankets and layers of clothing, decreasing the ambient temperature, and, if necessary, directing a fan toward the participant. If at any time the tempe rature rises more than 1.5\u00b0C above baseline despite these efforts, the site physician should be consulted for further evaluation and treatment. Osmoregulatory Risk and Mitigation MDMA administered in a controlled setting is not expected to have any risk s of osmoregulatory changes. Participants are not allowed to drink more than three liters of water over the course of the dosing session and fluid intake is spread out appropriately during the session. If a participant exhibits any signs of toxicity or cli nically significant dilutional hyponatremia despite these precautions after a dosing session , they should not receive another dosing session unless it is approved by the investigator, site physician, and the Medical Monitor. Genotoxicity Risk and Mitigati on The standard genotoxicity battery for MDMA has demonstrated that MDMA is negative for in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity, both with and without metabolic activation. Reproductive and Developmental Risks and Mitigation There are no data from the use of MDMA in pregnant people . In the absence of these data, epidemiological studies of Ecstasy are the only source of human data. One of two studies of Ecstasy users suggest that use of Ecstasy and polydrug use during pregnancy may be asso ciated MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 153 of 253 with some abnormalities at birth while the other failed to find this association [650, 651]. Studies in rats and rabbits have not shown direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. Repeated dose toxicity studies of adequate duration, fertility, early embryonic development , and embryofetal development studies of MDMA with toxicokinetics have been completed. These studies established the NOAEL dose to be the highest dose level evaluate d at 10 mg/kg/day (supratherapeutic dose) in both sexes of the rat for fertility , reproductive performance , and for maternal and developmental toxicity in the rabbit . The NOAEL dose was the highest dose level evaluated at 15 mg/kg/day (supratherapeutic d ose) for maternal and developmental toxicity in the rat. Due to the short half -life and single -dose dosing regimen of MDMA, pre - and post -natal development studies are not considered necessary for assessment of risk to the unborn. Assessment of embryofetal risk based on all available non -clinical (see Section 4.3.5 Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity ) and clinical data (see Section 6.2.3.6 Reproductive System ) supports unl ikely human teratogenicity/fetotoxicity in early pregnancy. On the basis of male fertility studies, t he embryofetal risk posed from treatment of male participants with MDMA is also unlikely. People able to become pregnant are included in the studies in this program, defined as those who are fertile, following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterili zation methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy , and bilateral oophorectomy. Postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. As a precautionary measure in clinical trials, p articipants who are able to become pregnant must have a negative pregnancy screen before undergoing each dosing session , which are conducted at approximately monthly intervals, and must agree to use adequate contraception at least during the Treatment Peri od, ending 10 days after the last dosing session . The end of relevant systemic exposure to MDMA is approximately 48 hours [255]. 7.4.4 Minimal Risks Minimum Level Risk does not indicate the likelihood the event will occur but indicates per the RACT assessment that no procedures are needed beyond basic monitoring to ensure screening is adequate to eliminate or manage the risk in the patient population. Common Expected AEs Common expected AEs were typically observed during dosing sessions but were transient and typical ly diminish ed as MDMA was metabolized and excreted over the next 48 hours after dosing. In the Phase 3 study MAPP1, the most common adverse events reported more frequently in the MDMA group were (>20%) muscle tightness, decreased appetite, nausea, increased blood pressure, feeling jittery, chest pain (non -cardiac), dry mouth, vision blurred, pollakiuria, intrusive thoughts, vomiting, stress, and musculoske letal chest pain . AEs were typically self - limiting. Neurotoxicity Risk It does not appear that MDMA -assisted therapy negatively impacts cognitive function based on data from Phase 2 studies sponsored by MAPS. The sponsor has carefully considered the risks of neurotoxicity and concludes that they are minimal in the intended clinical dosing regimen . This conclusion is supported by empirical and toxicokinetic evidence and is consistent with the lack of CNS toxicity reported in nonclinical MDMA studies. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 154 of 253 Abuse Potential Despite its classification as a Schedule I drug, an examination of findings in humans and animals suggests that MDMA possesses moderate abuse potential that is higher than that reported for \"classic hallucinogens\" like psilocybin, but lower than that reported for psychostimulants, such as cocaine or methamphetamine. There have been no AESIs reported i n Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies that could be suggestive of abuse potential among research stud y participants treated with MDMA. Diversion is not an issue for sponsor -supported studies because MDMA is only administered under the supervision of the clinical investigator. MDMA administration and handl ing follow s all regulations pertaining to the use of controlled substances within research studies. Studies assessing prevalence of problematic Ecstasy use or dependence suggest that a small percentage of individuals, especially those with prior psychological difficulties, may develop problematic Ecstasy use or dependence. An observational long-term follow -up assessment conducted at least 12 months after participation in a MAPS -sponsored early Phase 2 PTSD study of MDMA -assisted therapy found that 8.7% ( 8 of 92 ) participants reported using Ecstasy subseque nt to study participation, with 6 of the se 8 participants having used Ecstasy prior to study enrollment. Several participants volunteered that they would not seek out MDMA outside of a psychotherapeutic setting. Epidemiological Studies In epidemiological studies, there are reports of morbidity and mortality in individuals who use Ecstasy (material represented as containing MDMA, as defined above) around the world in unsupervised and uncontrolled settings, usually involving poly -drug use (see Table 3 in Section 5.1 Serious Reports of Incidents, Mortality, and Morbidity ). These events are relatively rare given the prevalence of Ecstasy use, estimated to be approximately 20 millio n worldwide. The most common adverse effects in Ecstasy and poly -drug use described in published case reports include hyperthermia, psychiatric problems, hepatotoxicity secondary to hyperthermia, and hyponatremia (see Section 4.3 Toxicology and Section 5.1 Serious Reports, Morbidity, and Mortality ). Published reports examining emergency department admission after Ecstasy use cite anxiety and panic reactions as the most frequent reason for admission. Fatal dysrhythmias have been reported following heavy MDMA use, resulting in ventricular fibrillation and asystole. Individuals with underlying cardiac and/or pulmonary disease and preexisting conditions such as Wolff -Parkinson - White syndrome a re especially at risk for heart failure and fatal arrhythmias when using MDMA. Set and setting likely play a role in the development of some Ecstasy -related adverse reports, such as vigorous exercise, lack of attention to somatic cues, and too little or to o much hydration combined with pharmacological action on AVP, resulting in hyperthermia or hyponatremia. Even if ambient temperature does less to moderate the effects of MDMA on body temperature in humans than originally believed based on animal studies, o ther environmental and behavioral factors, as those related to vigorous exercise, may be involved. 7.5 Reference Safety Information for Regulatory Reporting The Reference Safety Information (RSI) below outlines expected Serious Adverse Reactions (SARs) that have been observed at least twice in the Clinical Development Program for worldwide regulatory reporting purposes and the information within the RSI does not present a comprehensive overview of the safety profile of the IMP (Table 3 5). MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 155 of 253 Table 35: Serious Adverse Reactions for the IMP Considered Expected for Safety Reporting Purposes System Organ Class SARs As of October 01 , 2021 : Number of subjects exposed within the development program (N)= 358 Number of subjects exposed outside the development program (N)= 1,441 All SARs Occurrence of fatal SARs Occurrence of life - threatening SARs N A (%) N (%) N (%) None None 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) A N=number of subjects who have experienced the SAR No SARs are considered expected by the sponsor for the purpose of expedited reporting of SUSARs. Although one SAR has been observed to date in MAPS -sponsored clinical trials (See Table 16 ), it has not been observed more than once and hence does not meet the definition of an SAR for the RSI. 8.0 Conclusion s Based on the current state of scientific knowledge, the risk for subjects meeting criteria for clinical studies who are exposed to MDMA at the single divided -dosing schedule , administered up to 3 times per treatment course, used in sponsor -supported studies appears to be low. Across Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies, the overall rates of AEs and reactions are acceptable and generally self-limiting. Safety data from the placebo -controlled Phase 3 trial indicates that common AEs reported at equivalent rates across groups are likely to represent the underlying illness being treated or the expected result of psychological therapy addressing traumatic experiences. The sponsor's pivotal Phase 3 trial (MAPP1 ) demonstrated that PTSD symptoms were significantly attenuated by MDMA -assisted therapy and confirm findings seen in Phase 2 studies. MDMA as an adjunct to supportive therapy was statistically superior for PTSD treatment in CAPS -5 severity scores from Baseline to 2 months after three blinded dosing sessions in comparison to therapy paired with an inactive placebo Future studies conducted by the sponsor are intended to further develop the safety profile of MDMA in the PTSD subject population, and subjects with other indications. The sponsor is exploring the use of MDMA -assisted therapy in the treatm ent of anxiety and eating disorders . MDMA -assisted therapy appears to be a promising treatment method for chronic PTSD. It is hoped that MDMA, with its unique pharmacological mechanisms combined with a novel mode of administration as an integrative multimo dal therapy , can improve upon available PTSD and anxiety treatments in terms of safety profiles, efficacy , and persistence of effect iveness . Based on the previously reported data and the current state of scientific knowledge, MDMA -assisted therapy demonstrates significant benefit that outweigh the risks using a 3 -session treatment model combined with non -drug therapy sessions for preparation and integration in the treatment of PTSD.MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 156 of 253 Appendix Appendix Table 1: Summary of Investigator -Initiated Trials with MDMA Funding/grants/ Support Study design Sample given MDMA Demographics Dose of MDMA HCl Comparator Safety findings ACTRN1261300068 5718 (Australia/New Zealand trial registry, 2013) Two studies; Randomized, double - blind placebo controlled, within - subjects design 13 Study 1: 3/2 (M/F) Average age 60 Study 2: 6/2 (M/F) Average age 53.4 Study 1: 30 mg (~0.42 mg/kg) Study 2: 70 mg (~1 mg/kg) Placebo No AEs of concern reported, no interventions required.

MDMA is metabolized by N- demethylation to the only active metabolite MDA by and MDA are further O-demethylated to HHMA and HHA, respectively. Both HHMA and HHA are subsequently O-methylated mainly to HMMA and HMA. These four metabolites, particularly HMMA and HMA, are excreted in the urine conjugated glucuronide or sulfate metabolites.

Sex In a pooled study analysis , sex was not predictive of plasma concentration once corrected for body weight [570]. Race PK parameters by dose of MDMA administered Blacks vs. Europeans MDA Cmax: Blacks vs. Europeans MDA Cmax: +1.4% in Blacks vs. Europeans Hepatic & with moderate hepatic impairment is planned as post -marketing Phase 4 study (MPKH) . Due to<20% renal clearan ce of the parent compound, a renal impairment PK study is not planned. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 197 of 253 Extrinsic Factors March 2022 Page Has not been studied Expected High Clinical Exposure Scenario Metabolism of MDMA is complex, with 50 -75% of the parent compound being metabolized. Major enzymes involved in metabolism of MDMA include: CYP2D6 (>30%)> CYP1A2>CYP3A4>CYP2C19> -125 mg) reversibly inhibit CYP2D6 and decrease CYP3A4 activity, with CYP2D6 activity normalizing after 10 days post -drug. Compensatory metabolic mechanisms have been demonstrated when CYP2D6 is inhibited, such as an increase in CYP1A2 activity by 20 -40% [571]. In the therapeutic dose range of 75-125 mg MDMA HCl , a concentration -dependent effect is observed. Studying higher doses of MDMA in healthy subjects poses both safety and ethical concerns due to the Schedule 1 controlled substance status of MDMA. A lthough elevation of blood pressure and heart rate has been observed, these cases have not been accompanied by clinical signs and symptoms of end organ effects of hypertension (e.g. , chest pain, shortness of breath, neurological deficit or confusion) and h ave not been considered clinically significant AEs. The worst -case scenario would be strong inhibition of both CYP2D6, CYP2B6, and CYP1A2 combined with administration of an initial dose of 125 mg MDMA HCl followed by a supplemental half -dose 1.5 -2.0 hou rs later. Based on the exposure observed with CYP2D6/CYP2B6 inhibition by Bupropion with a Cmax elevation of +14% and AUC elevation of +33%, combined with a Cmax elevation of +12.8% and AUC elevation of +16.2% with a supplemental dose, the increase in expo sure is estimated to be Cmax +26.8% of MDMA and AUC +49.2% of MDMA. If CYP1A2 is additionally inhibited, a conservative estimate would be to double the exposure estimate for a Cmax elevation of +53% and AUC could be elevated up to +75%. 125 mg MDMA HCl : If an estimated 60% of metabolism is shut down, moderate hepatic impairment would double the AUC to be equivalent to 250 mg MDMA HCl. PK exposure to single -doses above 150 mg MDMA HCl remain untested to date. PK studies planned to be conducted will cover a therapeutic dose of 120 mg MDMA HCl , with a maximum dosage strength of 60 mg MDMA HCl capsules . In MAPS -sponsored clinical trials, MDMA is only administered under the supervision of trained and qualified healthcare professionals in a controlled setting. MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 199 of 253 Preclinical Cardiac Safety In vitro nonclinical data: The sponsor has completed an appropriately controlled, in vitro IKr Assay (commonly referred to as a human Ether -\u00e0-go-go-Related Gene (hERG) assay) per ICH S7A and S7B. Final results from the cell patch clamp measure found an IC 50 of 206 \u00b5M and a Hill coefficient of 1.1 for MDMA at near -physiologic temperature (33\u00b0C), with a 170 -fold ratio over the expected unbound MDMA plasma concentration in clinical exposure at 2 mg/kg p.o. [218]. These results demonstrate that MDMA has minimal risk of QTc prolongation or Torsade de Pointes (TdP), which is one of the most critical types of arrhythmia associated with sudden death. In vivo nonclinical data: The sponsor has completed an in vivo cardiovascular substudy as a part of the GLP Extended Single -Dose Neurotoxicology study administering beagle dogs with 9/12 mg/kg p.o. MDMA (with correction factor for HCl once w eekly for 4 weeks (Study 2884 -002). The dog is commonly used to inve stigate cardiac electrophysiology in a manner that will extrapolate to humans in terms of which cardiac ion channels contribute to cardiac repolarization and to the duration of the action potential. All ani mals in all groups received an electrocardiographi c (ECG) examination pretest, and all survivors predose and 1 -2 hours postdose on Day 1 and prior to terminal necropsy (study days 2 and 27). Standard ECGs (10 Lead) were recorded at 50 mm/sec. The RR, PR, and QT intervals, and QRS dur ation were measured an d recorded using an appropriate lead. The Principal Investigator for electrocardiographic analysis interpreted the electrocardiograms. Heart rate was calculated from the number of ECG complexes in 10 seconds. QTc was calculated using Van de Water's correct ion. There was no effect of the oral administration of MDMA on qualitative or quantitative ECG parameters in this study.

Cardiac Safety Events in MAPS Sponsored Clinical Trials The following cardiac safety events have been observed i n the MDMA group in MAPS Sponsored Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials to date. Adverse events resolved without treatment. QT prolongation : none reported Syncope (postural ): 1 blinded PTSD participant receiving active dose (64 mg to 106 mg MDMA) and 3 open -label PTSD participant s receiving active dose (68 mg to 128 mg MDMA) experienced this AE. Syncope (non -postural): none reported Seizures : none reported Exacerbation of ventricular extrasystoles : 1 blinded PTSD participant receiving active dose (106 mg MDM A) experienced this AE. Participant had one PVC at baseline EKG prior to exposure and a history of PVCs. Observed during fifth exposure, duration 1 day, reported to sponsor as expected SAR based on hospitalization for observation and further assessment. Ventricular tachycardia: none reported Sinus tachycardia : 1 blinded PTSD participant receiving active dose MDMA in study MP -1 experienced this AE.

Palpitations: 6 Phase 2 open -label PTSD participa nts receiving active dose (68 mg to 128 mg MDMA) , 4 Phase 3 blinded PTSD participant s receiving active dose (68 mg to 100 mg MDMA) , and 1 Phase 2 open -label PTSD participant receiving active dose (68 mg to 100 mg MDMA) experienced this AE. Ventricular fi brillation: none reported Flutter: none reported Torsade de pointes: none reported Sudden deaths: none reported MAPS MDMA Investigator's Brochure U.S. 14th Ed: 18 March 2022 Page 202 of 253 In the Phase 2 study MP -8, participant s with controlled hypertension (kept normal with medication) were allowed entry into the study if they passed a nuclear stress test and carotid ultrasound in addition to normal EKG at screening. A total of 4 controlled hype rtension subjects were enrolled and treated (25 mg MDMA N=1, 64 mg MDMA N=1, 106 mg MDMA N=2). Subjects receiving 64 mg and 106 mg MDMA experienced transient systolic blood pressure (SBP) above 160 mmHg in 75% (3 of 4) of participants during blinded sessions wi th 64 mg to 106 mg MDMA and in 67% (2 of 3) participants r eceiving 84 mg to 106 mg MDMA during open -label sessions. No increase in SBP >160 mmHg occurred after administration of 25 mg MDMA. Among these 4 subjects, peak SBP during blinded MDMA exposure was 131 mmHg with 25 mg MDMA, 179 mmHg with 64 mg MDMA and 1 77 mmHg with 106 mg MDMA. During the open -label crossover with 84 mg to 106 mg MDMA, the peak SBP during exposure was 193 mmHg. The maximum systolic blood pressure for these 7 participants with controlled hypertension was 193 mmHg, which occurred during an open -label session. The baseline values and elevations after MDMA appear higher in this sub -group than the overall sample but any meaningful comparison is limited by the sample size. None of the participants with cont rolled hypertension experienced AEs of the cardiovascular system and SBP returned to baseline or near -baseline levels at final session reading without any additional medication. In the Phase 3 placebo -controlled study MAPP1, participant s with controlled hypertension (kept normal with medicati on) were allowed entry into the study if they passed a nuclear stress test and carotid ultrasound in addition to normal EKG at screening. There were 7 participants with a medical history of controlled hypertension (n = 3 MDMA), of these three MDMA partici pants one had transient systolic BP > 180 mmHg post- dosing at the first and second dosing session (increase in systolic BP > 40 mmHg compared to pre -dose measurement) and another one of these had a transient diastolic BP > 110 mmHg post -dosing at the seco nd dosing session (increase in diastolic BP > 25 mmHg compared to pre - dose measurement). None of the MDMA participants with controlled hypertension experienced AEs of the cardiovascular systems. Systolic BP and diastolic BP returned to baseline or near -baseline levels at final session reading without any additional medication or intervention. A In MP -1, participants received either MDMA or an inactive placebo, but participants who took the option of continuing to the open -label crossover Stage 2 then received active dose MDMA as well (only one participant chose not to continue to Stage 2 in MP -1, due to a strong and sustained placebo response) B In MP1 -E2, participants were previously enrolled in MP -1. These participants were not counted again in the final summation. C The MT -1 study uses a blinded full crossover design, with placebo administered in one session and MDMA in another session. D The ongoing MAPP2 study has a blinded 1:1 allocation. The combined blinded exposures were not added to either total for MDMA or placebo. E Values in sponsor -supported studies reflect the active MDMA free -base weight, not the total MDMA HCl weight. See Appendix Table 23: MDMA Salt to Active Moiety Conversion Chart.
