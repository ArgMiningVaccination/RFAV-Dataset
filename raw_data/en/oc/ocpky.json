Do you want to see if meditation is something for you? Meditation sessions are held in the Forum Library every Monday and Thursday at lunchtime. Mindfulness meditation During the guided meditation sessions you can practice mindfulness and meditation techniques. You'll learn to become aware of your thoughts and feelings and accept them as they are without needing to change them. This can help to reduce stress and anxiety. Practical information The meditations are for both beginners and advanced practitioners. The workshops are led by qualified instructors of [Spectrum (Student Platform & Chaplaincy)](https://spectrum-wageningen.com/) and are for WUR students only. The sessions are on Mondays and Thursday from 12.30 to 13.15 in room 366, Forum Library. No need to register. Just come by 10 minutes beforehand, so we can start on time. "}
