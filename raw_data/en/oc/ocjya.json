These physicians are trained in both modern medicine and acupuncture, giving them the ability to examine a problem, make a diagnosis, and offer treatment options from both modern medical and acupuncture perspectives. That means their patients get the best of both worlds: proven, ancient healing techniques and cutting-edge, modern medicine. If you are an AAMA member, you can use the login button to access the Member portal of the site. Join the AAMA! Not currently a member, but interested in joining the Academy?
