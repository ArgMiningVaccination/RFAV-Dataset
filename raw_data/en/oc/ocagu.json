For patients in a shared (semi-private) room, visiting hours and rules may be different. Stanford Medicine strongly encourages visitors to be fully vaccinated. Please do not enter to visit if you have any of the following symptoms listed above. While masks are no longer required in most areas, we still strongly recommend wearing one when inside. Some departments, including those that serve high-risk patients, may continue to require masking. Use hand sanitizer when you enter and leave the patient's room. We want to support you and your loved ones at the end of life. The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) can spread easily and we want to keep you and our staff safe. To support you, staff and your loved ones we have developed some guidelines we ask you to follow. These restrictions are modeled from policies at other health organizations, as well as guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California State Department of Health. A visit to a loved one with COVID-19 at end-of-life will put you at a higher risk of disease but these risks can be mitigated by following the steps outlined below. If you have any questions, please talk to the nurse taking care of your loved one. - Talk to your loved one's nurse about approval to enter the hospital. All visitors entering the hospital must be pre-approved and healthy. - The number of people allowed in the room at any one time will be limited. - The amount of time you can stay will also be limited as the longer a visitor spends with an individual who has COVID-19, the greater the risk of getting the virus. - Once you are outside of the hospital room you will need to work with a nurse to put on Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including a gown, gloves, eye protection and a new mask. You must wash your hands or use alcohol sanitizer upon entering and leaving the room and hospital to prevent the spread of disease. - Although death is a time to support each other with compassion, due to the possibility of transmission, visitors should not hug or physically comfort patients or other family members. The outside of the PPE can become contaminated and could spread disease. Please reserve personal contact among family for only after PPE is taken off, a new mask is on, and hands are washed. - Once you are in the room you must stay there until you call for a nurse to help you leave or you are asked to leave because a nurse or doctor needs to provide care. Follow the lead of the health care team. There is no food or drink allowed in the room and you will not be able to go in and out of the room or hospital. - When you leave, a nurse will help you take off the PPE and put on a clean mask. You must immediately exit the hospital after leaving the room. If you are not able to be in the room or at the bedside we do have ways to connect you through private video or phone calls. The nurse can help or you can call Guest Services at [650-498-3333](tel://650-498-3333).
