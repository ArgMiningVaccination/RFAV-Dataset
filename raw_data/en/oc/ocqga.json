Feb 23, 2023 Research from the Swirski lab is among the first to show that skipping meals triggers a response in the brain that negatively affects immune cells. The study was published in Immunity, and could lead to a better understanding of how chronic fasting may affect the body long-term. Feb 22, 2023 Research in the Bogunovic lab has revealed which parts in the immune system go awry and contribute to autoimmune diseases in individuals with Down syndrome. The findings were published in Nature and add to the team's previous work showing that people with Down syndrome have less frequent by more severe viral infections. Feb 08, 2023 A phase II clinical trial led by Brian Kim, MD suggests that patients experiencing moderate-to-severe itching, associated with notalgia paresthetica, could potentially get relief with oral difelikefalin. The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine and offers hope for patients with this common, yet underdiagnosed condition which is characterized by a persistent itch in the upper back. Feb 01, 2023 This grant will fund efforts to identify potential new strategies for improving treatment of NMIBC with the only FDA approved first- line treatment option, Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin as a single therapy or in combination with other immunotherapies. Oct 24, 2022 Dr. Burakoff received the award for developing small molecule therapeutic inhibitors targeting HPK1 to regulate the immune response against cancer. This technology entered phase 1 clinical trials in spring 2022. Oct 04, 2022 One of the largest single-center COVID-19 cohort studies, to date, revealed that maintenance of reparative lung macrophages while reducing accumulation of circulating myeloid cells may be a viable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and other inflammatory lung diseases. Sep 12, 2022 Research published in Cancer Cell reported important discoveries about the mechanism by which bladder cancer cells foil attacks from the immune system and identified potential ways to make immunotherapy more effective against bladder cancer. Sep 01, 2022 In a report published in Blood Advances, researchers showed that multiple myeloma patients who relapse after initial bispecific antibodies therapy can benefit from a second bispecific antibody or CAR-T cell therapy. Jun 21, 2022 The American Association of Indian Scientists in Cancer Research (AAISCR) presented the 2022 Lifetime Achievement award to Dr. Bhardwaj for advancing the understanding of how to fight cancer by using innate immune cells to reverse immunosuppression in tumor microenvironments. Jun 14, 2022 In a study published in Nature Biotechnology, Mount Sinai researchers reported the development of a rapid blood assay that measures the magnitude and duration of a person's immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Mar 28, 2022 Bishuang Cai, PhD is the recipient of the award for her project, \"A novel mechanism of MerTK cleavage in atherosclerosis\"; the award supports highly promising healthcare and academic professionals to explore innovative questions or pilot studies that will provide preliminary data and training necessary to assure the applicant's future success as a research scientist. Mar 28, 2022 Hugh Sampson, MD was awarded by the American Academy of Allergy Asthma & Immunology for a lifetime of service as an allergy/immunology mentor for students, residents, fellow-in-training and faculty. Mar 24, 2022 Etienne Humblin is one of the winners of the travel grant for his abstract, \"Discovering novel mechanisms by which CD28 signaling influences antigen-specific PD-1+ CD8 T cells\". Jan 31, 2022 Dr. Bishuang Cai is the recipient of the award which supports talented biomedical scientists in their academic research careers. Jan 25, 2022 In collaboration with Mass Gen and U Toronto, Sacha Gnjatic, PhD received the subaward for investigating biomarkers to accurately predict the onset and prognosis of Crohn's disease. Jan 19, 2022 Results from first-of-its-kind Mount Sinai study show that immunotherapy before liver cancer surgery can kill tumor, and likely residual cancer cells.
