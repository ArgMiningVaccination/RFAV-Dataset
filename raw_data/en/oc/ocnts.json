How to End the Autism Epidemic is extensively and exhaustively referenced (20 pages of references) to the published scientific literature, is fully indexed with significant testimonials from academics, clinicians and politicians including Robert Kennedy Jr. Vaccine Injury Circle of Denial Anyone reading this book enters into and is assailed by the murky, almost mafia-sounding interconnected worlds of science, big pharma, alleged scientific and corporate fraud. JB Handley quotes Dr Richard Halvorsen who discusses the common term among researchers \"Getting Wakefielded\". \"To go to such extreme - and desperate lengths- to annihilate Dr [Andrew] Wakefield (the person, note not the science) some people must be very afraid. Afraid, presumably, that parents might actually believe something that is blatantly obvious: that is that all vaccines can cause serious adverse reactions, including autism.\" Dr Richard Halvorsen worked as a GP (family doctor) in central London for over 20 years, author of The Truth about Vaccines, founder [BabyJabs](http://www.babyjabs.co.uk) children's immunisation service. JB Handley doesn't mince words regarding issues including herd immunity, vaccine safety and corporate lies and myths as explained by Dr Russell Blaylock, retired neurosurgeon: \"That vaccine-induced herd immunity is mostly myth can be proven quite simply. When I was in medical school, we were taught that all of the childhood vaccines lasted a lifetime. This thinking existed for over 70 years. It was not until relatively recently that it was discovered that most of these vaccines lost their effectiveness 2 to 1 years after being given. What this means is that at least half the population, that is the baby boomers, have had no vaccine-induced immunity against any of these diseases for which they had been vaccinated very early in life. In essence, at least 50% or more of the population was unprotected for decades.\" [https://jbhandleyblog.com/home/2018/neurodiversity](https://jbhandleyblog.com/home/2018/neurodiversity) In 2017 a child following CDC's recommended schedule received thirty-eight - 38 vaccines by age five, nearly quadruple what a child received in the 1980s and more than twelve times what a child received in the 1960s, data published in the article in PH Online [Issue 250](http://www.positivehealth.com/issue/issue-250-november-2018) [Comparing Benefits of Vaccine Use to Vaccine Risks](http://www.positivehealth.com/article/immune-function/comparing-benefits-of-vaccine-use-to-vaccine-risks). The rate of increase of autism is graphically depicted above - from 1 in 10,000 in 1970, 1 in 2,500 in 1985, 1 in 250 in 2001 and 1 in 36 in 2018. JB Handley forensically examines and quantifies the toxicity of ingredients such as aluminium, with evidence from leading scientists informing the organizations including the CDC (Centers for Disease Control) Letter dated 15 June 2017 from Prof Christopher Exley PhD to Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) affirming that aluminium adjuvants in vaccines may have a role in the aetiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) This book is informative, authoritative and investigative with scientific research revealing that the triggers for autism may include multiple factors including mitochondrial dysfunction and immune activation from toxic substances including aluminium. Superb nuggets of information in this book include little-known and freedom of information-derived legal depositions (witness's sworn out-of-court testimony) from perhaps the top immunologists and vaccination scientists in the world including Dr Andrew Zimmerman (former director of medical research at Kennedy Krieger Institute, Johns Hopkins University: \"The cause for regressive encephalopathy in Hannah Poling (daughter of Dr Jon Poling) at age 19 months was underlying mitochondrial dysfunction, exacerbated by vaccine-induced fever and immune stimulation that exceeded metabolic energy reserves. This acute expenditure of metabolic reserves let to permanent irreversible brain injury. Thus, if not for this event [her vaccination], Hannah may have led a normal and productive life. Presently, I predict Hannah will have a normal lifespan but with significant lifelong disability.\" Dr Jon Poling: \"...I don't think vaccines are the only way that you can tip over a child like Hannah to regress and have an encephalopathy and regress into autism. There are probably multiple triggers. In my daughter clearly it was vaccination; that was our experience.\" JB Hanley proposes a 12-point proposal to end the autism epidemic, of which point No. 1 is to \"Immediately reduce the total number of vaccines given to American children with suggestions for a safer, simpler vaccine schedule.\" He also reports on encouraging treatment and recovery programmes using Biomedical Interventions including: - Special Diet: removal of offending foods provoking allergies including gluten, dairy, soy, sugar. Several diets have been successful; two diets which are hard to implement are GAPS diet and the ketogenic diet; - Gut healing: the guts of children with autism are often severely impaired; - Nutrition: hyperbaric oxygen, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusions. I commend this book absolutely with no reservations and envisage, unlike with cancer, where so many researchers and clinicians have been advocating less successfully, integrated approaches with less toxic, even lethal treatments including poisonous chemotherapy - that campaigners including JB Handley will succeed in ending the autism Epidemic.
