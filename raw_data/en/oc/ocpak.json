[+] [+] The major cause of lower extremity (LE) amputation today continues to be peripheral vascular disease (PVD), particularly with associated diabetes. Two-thirds of all LE amputations in the United States today are due to complications of diabetes. [1](#osullrehab6_ch22rf1) Approximately 16 per 1,000 individuals with diabetes over age 75 will undergo an LE amputation as compared with 1.78 of similar individuals who do not have diabetes. Major improvements in noninvasive diagnosis, revascularization, and wound healing techniques have increased the age at which individuals with diabetes may come to amputation. Perioperative mortality has been variously reported between 7% and 13% and is usually associated with other medical problems such as cardiac disease and strokes. [2](#osullrehab6_ch22rf2), [3](#osullrehab6_ch22rf3), [4](#osullrehab6_ch22rf4) There are approximately 20.8 million children and adults with diabetes and about 5% of the population is affected with some form of vascular disease. [5](#osullrehab6_ch22rf5) Many of the patients we treat in all types of settings have diabetes although we are usually treating them for some other problem. Physical therapists can help by learning more about diabetes and diabetic foot care and by making patient education an integral part of the plan of care (POC). Several studies have indicated a positive relationship between early patient education and proper foot care and a reduction in amputations. [6](#osullrehab6_ch22rf6), [7](#osullrehab6_ch22rf7) [+] [+] The second leading cause of amputation is trauma, usually from motor vehicle accidents, war, or gunshots. Individuals with traumatic amputations are often young adults, more frequently men, and have often been involved in an active lifestyle before amputation. The incidence of amputation from osteogenic sarcoma has been reduced owing to improved imaging techniques, more effective chemotherapy, and better limb salvage procedures. Amputation may be necessary if the tumor is large and cannot "}
