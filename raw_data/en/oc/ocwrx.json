Purpose The mission of drug courts is to stop the ab use of alcohol and ot her drugs and related criminal activity. Drug courts promote recovery through a coordinated response to offenders dependent on alcohol and other drugs. Realizat ion of these goals requires a team approach, including cooperation and collaboration of th e judges, prosecutors, defense counsel, probation authorities, other corrections personnel, law enforcement, pretrial services agencies, TASC programs, evaluators, an array of local service providers, and the greater community. State-level organizations representing AOD issues, law enforcement and criminal justice, vocational rehabilitation, educ ation, and housing also have important roles to play. The combined energies of these individuals and organizations can assist and encourage defendants to accept help that could change their lives. The criminal justice system has the unique ability to influence a person shortly after a significant triggering event such as arrest, and thus persuade or compel that person to enter and remain in treatment. Research indicates th at a person coerced to enter treatment by the criminal justice system is likely to do as well as one who volunteers.1 Drug courts usually employ a multiphased treatment proce ss, generally divided into a stabilization phase, an intensive treatment pha se, and a transition phase. The stabilization phase may include a period of AOD detoxificati on, initial treatment assessment, education, and screening for other needs. The intensive treatment phase typically involves individual and group counseling and other core and adjunc tive therapies as they are available (see Key Component #4). The transition phase may emphasi ze social reintegration, employment and education, housing services, an d other aftercare activities. Performance Benchmarks 1. Initial and ongoing planning is carried out by a broad-based grou p, including persons representing all aspects of the criminal justice system, the local treatment delivery system, funding agencies, and the local co mmunity's other key policymakers. 2. Documents defining the drug court's missi on, goals, eligibility criteria, operating procedures, and performance measures are collaboratively developed, reviewed, and agreed upon. 1 Hubbard, R., Marsden, M., Rachal, J., Harwood, H., Cavanaugh E., and Ginzburg, H.

Pringle G.H., Impact of the criminal justice system on substance abusers seeking professional help, Journal of Drug Issues, Summer, pp. 275-283, vol 12, no. 3, 1982. 1 3. Abstinence and law-abiding behavior are the goals, with specific and measurable criteria marking progress. Criteria may include compliance with program requirements, reductions in criminal behavi or and AOD use, participation in treatment, restitution to the victim or to the community, and declining incidence of AOD use. 4. The court and treatment providers maintain ongoing communication, including frequent exchanges of timely and accurate informati on about the individual participant's overall program performance.2 5. The judge plays an active role in the treatm ent process, including frequently reviewing treatment progress. The judge re sponds to each participant's pos itive efforts as well as to noncompliant behavior. 6. Interdisciplinary education is provided for every person involved in drug court operations to develop a shar ed understanding of the values, goals, and operating procedures of both the treatment and justice system components. 7. Mechanisms for sharing decisionmaking and re solving conflicts among drug court team members, such as multidisciplinary committe es, are established to ensure professional integrity. 2 All communication about an individual's participation in treatment must be in compliance with the provisions of 42 CFR, Part 2 (the federal regulations governing confidentiality of alcohol and drug abuse patient records), and with similar State and local regulations. 2 Key Component #2 Using a nonadversarial approach, prosecution and defense counsel promote public safety while protecti ng participants' due process rights. Purpose To facilitate an individual's progress in trea tment, the prosecutor and defense counsel must shed their traditional adversarial courtroom rela tionship and work together as a team. Once a defendant is accepted into the drug court program, the team's focus is on the participant's recovery and law-abiding behavior\u2014not on the merits of the pending case. The responsibility of the prosecuting attorney is to protect the public's safety by ensuring that each candidate is appropriate for the program and complies with all drug court requirements. The responsibility of the defense counsel is to protect the participant's due process rights while encouraging full participation. Both the prosecuting attorney and the defense counsel play important roles in the co urt's coordinated strate gy for responding to noncompliance. Performance Benchmarks 1. Prosecutors and defense counsel participate in the design of screening, eligibility, and case-processing policies and procedures to gu arantee that due process rights and public safety needs are served. 2. For consistency and stability in the early stages of drug court operations, the judge, prosecutor, and court-appointed defense counsel should be assigned to the drug court for a sufficient period of time to build a sense of teamwork and to reinforce a nonadversarial atmosphere. 3. The prosecuting attorney: Reviews the case and determines if the de fendant is eligible for the drug court program. Files all necessary legal documents. Participates in a coordinate d strategy for responding to positive drug tests and other instances of noncompliance. Agrees that a positive drug test or open court admission of drug possession or use will not result in the filing of additiona l drug charges based on that admission. Makes decisions regarding the participan t's continued enrollment in the program based on performance in treatment rather than on legal aspects of the case, barring additional criminal behavior. 4. The defense counsel: Reviews the arrest warrant, affidavits, charging document, and other relevant information, and reviews all program documents (e.g., waivers, written agreements). 3 Advises the defendant as to the nature an d purpose of the drug court, the rules governing participation, the consequences of abiding or failing to abide by the rules, and how participating or not participating in the drug court will affect his or her interests. Explains all of the rights that the de fendant will temporarily or permanently relinquish. Gives advice on alternative courses of action, including legal and treatment alternatives available outside the drug court program, and discusses with the defendant the long-term benefits of sobriety and a drug-free life. Explains that because crim inal prosecution for admitting to AOD use in open court will not be invoked, the defendant is encouraged to be truthful with the judge and with treatment staff, and informs the partic ipant that he or she will be expected to speak directly to the judge, not through an attorney. 4 Key Component #3 Eligible participants are identified early and promptly placed in the drug court program. Purpose Arrest can be a traumatic event in a person's life. It creates an immediate crisis and can force substance abusing behavior into the open, making denial difficult. The period immediately after an arrest, or after appreh ension for a probation violation, provides a critical window of opportunity for intervening and introducing the value of AOD treatment. Judicial action, taken promptly after arre st, capitalizes on the cris is nature of the arrest and booking process. Rapid and effective action also increases pub lic confidence in the criminal justice system. Moreover, incorporating AOD c oncerns into the case dispos ition process can be a key element in strategies to link criminal ju stice and AOD treatment systems overall. Performance Benchmarks 1. Eligibility screening is based on established wri tten criteria. Criminal justice officials or others (e.g., pretrial serv ices, probation, TASC) are designated to screen cases and identify potential drug court participants. 2. Eligible participants for drug court are promptly advised about program requirements and the relative merits of participating. 3. Trained professionals screen drug court-eligible individuals for AOD problems and suitability for treatment. 4. Initial appearance before the drug court judge occurs immediately after arrest or apprehension to ensure program participation. 5. The court requires that eligible participants enroll in AOD treatment services immediately. 5 Key Component #4 Drug courts provide access to a continuum of alcohol, drug, and other related treatment and rehabilitation services. Purpose The origins and patterns of AOD problems are complex and unique to each individual. They are influenced by a variety of accumulated social and cultural experiences. If treatment for AOD is to be effective, it must also call on the resources of primary health and mental health care and make use of so cial and other support services.3 In a drug court, the treatment experience begins in the courtroom and continues through the participant's drug court involvement. In other words, drug court is a comprehensive therapeutic experience, only part of which takes place in a designated treatment setting. The treatment and criminal justice professionals are members of the therapeutic team. The therapeutic team (treatment providers, the judge, lawyers, case managers, supervisors, and other program staff) should maintain frequent, regular communication to provide timely reporting of a participant's progress and to ensure that responses to compliance and noncompliance are swift and coor dinated. Procedures for re porting progress should be clearly defined in the drug court's operating documents. While primarily concerned with criminal activity and AOD use, the drug court team also needs to consider co-occurring problems such as mental illness, primary medical problems, HIV and sexually-transmitted diseases, homelessness; basic educational deficits, unemployment and poor job preparation; spouse and family troubles \u2014especially domestic violence\u2014and the long-term effects of child hood physical and sexual abuse. If not addressed, these factors will impair an individual's success in treatment and will compromise compliance with program requirements. Co-occu rring factors should be considered in treatment planning. In addition, treatment servi ces must be relevant to the ethnicity, gender, age, and other characteristics of the participants. Longitudinal studies have cons istently documented the effectiveness of AOD treatment in reducing criminal recidivism and AOD use.4 A study commissioned by the Office of National Drug Control Policy found AOD treatmen t is significantly more cost-effective than domestic law enforcement, interdiction, or \"source-country control\" in reducing drug use in the United States.5 Research indicates that the length of time an offender spends in 3 Treatment-Based Drug Court Planning Guide and Checklist, Combining Alcohol an d Other Drug Abuse Treatment With Diversion for Juveniles in the Justice System, TIP #21, Treatment Drug Courts: Integrating Substance Abuse Treatment With Legal Case Processing, TIP #23.

Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, Office of National Drug C ontrol Policy, Policy Research Center, 1994. 7 treatment is related to the level of AO D abuse and criminal justice involvement.6 A comprehensive study conducted by the State of California indicates that AOD treatment provides a $7 return for every $1 spent on treatment. The study found that outpatient treatment is the most cost-effective approach, although residential treatment, sober living houses, and methadone maintenance are also cost-effective.7 Comprehensive studies conducted in California8 and Oregon9 found that positive outcomes associated with AOD treatment are sustained for several years following completion of treatment. For the many communities that do not have ad equate treatment resources, drug courts can provide leadership to increa se treatment options and enrich the availability of support services. Some drug courts have found creative ways to access services, such as implementing treatment readiness programs fo r participants who are on waiting lists for comprehensive treatment programs. In some juri sdictions, drug courts have established their own treatment programs where none existed. Other drug courts have made use of pretrial, probation, and public heal th treatment services. Performance Benchmarks 1. Individuals are initially screened and therea fter periodically asse ssed by both court and treatment personnel to ensure that treatmen t services and individuals are suitably matched: An assessment at treatment entry, while useful as a baseline, provides a time specific \"snapshot\" of a person's needs and may be based on limited or unreliable information. Ongoing assessment is necessa ry to monitor progress, to change the treatment plan as necessary, and to identify relapse cues. If various levels of treatment are availabl e, participants are matched to programs according to their specific needs. Guidelines for placement at various levels should be developed. Screening for infectious diseases and health referrals occurs at an early stage. 2. Treatment services are comprehensive: Services should be available to meet the needs of each participant. Treatment services may include, but are not limited to, group counseling; individual and family counseling; relapse prevention; 12-step health educat ion; medical detoxification; acupuncture for detoxification, for control of craving, and to make people more amenable to treatment; domestic violence programs; ba tterers' treatment; and treatment for the long-term effects of childhood physical and sexual abuse. 6 Field, G.

Salem, OR: Office of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Programs, Oregon Department of Human Resources, February 1996. 8 Other services may include housing; educ ational and vocational training; lega l, money management, and other social service needs; cognitive behavioral therapy to address criminal thinking patterns; ange r management; transitional housing; social and athletic activities; and meditation or other techniques to pr omote relaxation and self-control. Specialized services should be considered for participants with co-occurring AOD problems and mental health disorders. Drug courts should establish linkages with mental health providers to furnish services (e.g., medication m onitoring, acute care) for participants with co-occurring disorders. Flexibility (e.g., in duration of treatment phases) is essential in designing drug cour t services for participants with mental health problems. Treatment programs or prog ram components are designed to address the particular treatment issues of women and other special populations. Treatment is available in a number of settings, including detoxification, acute residential, day treatment, outpat ient, and sober living residences. Clinical case management services are av ailable to provide ongoing assessment of participant progress and needs, to coordinate re ferrals to services in addition to primary treatment, to provide structure and support for individuals who typically have difficulty using services even when they are available, and to ensure communication between the court and the various service providers. 3. Treatment services are accessible: Accommodations are made for persons with phy sical disabilities, for those not fluent in English, for those needing child care, and/or for persons with limited literacy. Treatment facilities are accessible by pu blic transportation, when possible. 4. Funding for treatment is adequate, stab le, and dedicated to the drug court: To ensure that services are immediately available throughout the participant's treatment, agreements are made between courts and treatment providers. These agreements are based on firm budgetary and service delivery commitments. Diverse treatment funding strategies ar e developed based on both government and private sources at national, State, and local levels. Health care delivered through managed care organizations is en couraged to provide resources for the AOD treatment of member participants. Payment of fees, fines, and restitution is part of treatment. Fee schedules are commensurate with an in dividual's ability to pay. However, no one should be turned away solely because of an inability to pay. 5. Treatment services have quality controls: Direct service providers are certified or licensed where required, or otherwise demonstrate profic iency according to accepted professional standards. Education, training, and ongoing clinical su pervision are provided to treatment staff. 9 6. Treatment agencies are accountable: Treatment agencies give the court accurate and timely information about a participant's progress. Information exchan ge complies with th e provisions of 42 CFR, Part 2 (the Federal regulations govern ing confidentiality of AOD abuse patient records) and with applicable State statutes. Responses to progress an d noncompliance are incorpor ated into the treatment protocols. 7. Treatment designs and delivery systems are se nsitive and relevant to issues of race, culture, religion, gender, age, et hnicity, and sexual orientation. 10 Key Component #5 Abstinence is monitored by frequent alcohol and othe r drug testing. Purpose Frequent court-ordered AOD test ing is essential. An accurate testing program is the most objective and efficient way to establish a framework for accountability and to gauge each participant's progress. Modern technology offers highly re liable testing to determine if an individual has recently used specific drugs. Further, it is commonly recognized that alcohol use frequently contributes to relapse among individuals whose primary drug of choice is not alcohol. AOD testing results are objective measures of tr eatment effectiveness, as well as a source of important information for periodic review of treatment progress. AOD testing helps shape the ongoing interaction between the court and ea ch participant. Timely and accurate test results promote frankness and honesty among all parties. AOD testing is central to the drug court's moni toring of participant compliance. It is both objective and cost-effective. It gives the partic ipant immediate information about his or her own progress, making the partic ipant active and involved in the treatment process rather than a passive recipient of services. Performance Benchmarks 1. AOD testing policies and pro cedures are based on established and tested guidelines, such as those established by the American Pr obation and Parole Asso ciation. Contracted laboratories analyzing urine or other sample s should also be held to established standards. 2. Testing may be administered randomly or at scheduled intervals, bu t occurs no less than twice a week during the first several months of an individual's enrollment. Frequency thereafter will vary dependin g on participant progress. 3. The scope of testing is suffic iently broad to detect the pa rticipant's primary drug of choice as well as other potential drugs of abuse, including alcohol. 4. The drug-testing procedure must be certain. Elements contributing to the reliability and validity of a urinalysis testing process include, but are not limited to: Direct observation of urine sample collection. Verification temperature and measurement of creatinine levels to determine the extent of water loading. Specific, detailed, written procedures regarding all aspects of urine sample collection, sample analysis, and result reporting. A documented chain of custody for each sample collected. 11 Quality control and quality assurance proced ures for ensuring the integrity of the process. Procedures for verifying accuracy when drug test results are contested. 5. Ideally, test results are available and communicated to the court and the participant within one day. The drug court functions best when it can respond immediately to noncompliance; the time between sample collect ion and availability of results should be short. 6. The court is immediately notified when a part icipant has tested positive, has failed to submit to AOD testing, has submitted the sample of another, or has adulterated a sample. 7. The coordinated strate gy for responding to noncomplian ce includes prom pt responses to positive tests, missed tests, and fraudulent tests. 8. Participants should be abstinent for a subs tantial period of time prior to program graduation. 12 Key Component #6 A coordinated strategy gove rns drug court responses to participants' compliance. Purpose An established principle of AOD treatment is that addiction is a chronic, relapsing condition. A pattern of decr easing frequency of use before sustained abstinence from alcohol and other drugs is common. Becoming s ober or drug free is a learning experience, and each relapse to AOD use may teach something about the recovery process. Implemented in the early stages of treatment and emphasized throughout, therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing the return to AO D use help participants learn to manage their ambivalence toward recovery, identify situati ons that stimulate AOD cravings, and develop skills to cope with high-risk situations. Eventu ally, participants learn to manage cravings, avoid or deal more effectively with high-risk situations, and maintain sobriety for increasing lengths of time. Abstinence and public safety are the ultimate go als of drug courts, many participants exhibit a pattern of positive urine tests within the fi rst several months following admission. Because AOD problems take a long time to develop and because many factors c ontribute to drug use and dependency, it is rare that an individual ceases AOD use as soon as he or she enrolls in treatment. Even after a period of sustained abstinence, it is common for individuals to occasionally test positive. Although drug courts recognize that individuals have a tendency to relapse, continuing AOD use is not condoned. Drug co urts impose appropriate responses for continuing AOD use. Responses increase in severity fo r continued failure to abstain. A participant's progress through the drug co urt experience is measured by his or her compliance with the treatment regimen. Certainly cessation of drug use is the ultimate goal of drug court treatment. However, there is value in recognizing incremental progress toward the goal, such as showing up at all required court appearances, regularly arriving at the treatment program on time, attending and fully participating in the treatment sessions, cooperating with treatment staff, and submitting to regular AOD testing. Drug courts must reward c ooperation as well as respond to noncompliance. Small rewards for incremental successes have an important e ffect on a participant's sense of purpose and accomplishment. Praise from the drug court judge for regular attendance or for a period of clean drug tests, encouragement from the treatment staff or the judge at particularly difficult times, and ceremonies in which tokens of accomplishment are awarded in open court for completing a particular phase of treatment are all small but very important rewards that bolster confidence and give inspiration to continue. 13 Drug courts establis h a coordinated strategy, includin g a continuum of responses, to continuing drug use and other noncompliant behavior. A coordinated st rategy can provide a common operating plan for treatment provid ers and other drug court personnel. The criminal justice system representatives and the treatment providers develop a series of complementary, measured responses that will en courage compliance. A written copy of these responses, given to participants during the or ientation period, emphasizes the predictability, certainty, and swiftness of their application. Performance Benchmarks 1. Treatment providers, the judge, and other program staff maintain frequent, regular communication to provide timely reporting of progress and noncompliance and to enable the court to respond immediately. Procedures for reporting noncompliance are clearly defined in the drug court's operating documents. 2. Responses to compliance and noncompliance are explained verbally and provided in writing to drug court participants before th eir orientation. Period ic reminders are given throughout the treatment process. 3. The responses for complian ce vary in intensity: Encouragement and praise from the bench. Ceremonies and tokens of progress, including advancement to the next treatment phase. Reduced supervision. Decreased frequency of court appearances. Reduced fines or fees. Dismissal of criminal charges or reduction in the term of probation. Reduced or suspended incarceration. Graduation. 4. Responses to or sanctions fo r noncompliance might include: Warnings and admonishment from the bench in open court. Demotion to earlie r program phases. Increased frequency of testing and court appearances. Confinement in the courtroom or jury box. Increased monitoring and/or treatment intensity. Fines. Required community servi ce or work programs. Escalating periods of jail confinement (howev er, drug court participants remanded to jail should receive AOD treatment services while confined). Termination from the program and reinstatement of regular court processing. 14 Key Component #7 Ongoing judicial interaction with each drug court participant is essential. Purpose The judge is the leader of the drug court team , linking participants to AOD treatment and to the criminal justice system. This active, su pervising relationship, maintained throughout treatment, increases the likelihood that a participant will remain in treatment and improves the chances for sobriety and law-abiding behavior. Ongoing judicial supervision also communicates to participants\u2014often for the first time\u2014that someone in authority cares about them and is closely watching what they do. Drug courts require judges to step beyond their traditionally independent and objective arbiter roles and develop new expertise. The structure of the drug court allows for early and frequent judicial intervention. A drug court judge must be prepared to encourage appropriate behavior and to discourage and penalize inappropriate behavior. A drug court judge is knowledgeable about treatment methods and their limitations. Performance Benchmarks 1. Regular status hearings are used to monitor participant performance: Frequent status hearings du ring the initial phases of each participant's program establish and reinforce the drug court's policies, and ensure effective supervision of each drug court participant. Frequent hear ings also give the participant a sense of how he or she is doing in relation to others. Time between status hearings may be increased or decreased, based on compliance with treatment protocol s and progress observed. Having a significant number of drug cour t participants appear at a single session gives the judge the opportunity to educate both the offender at the bench and those waiting as to the benefits of prog ram compliance and consequences for noncompliance. 2. The court applies appropriate incentives an d sanctions to match the participant's treatment progress. 3. Payment of fees, fines and/or restitution is part of the participant's treatment. The court supervises such payments and takes into account the participant's financial ability to fulfill these obligations. The court ensures that no one is denied participation in drug courts solely because of on an inability to pay fees, fines, or restitution. 15 Key Component #8 Monitoring and evaluation measure the achievement of program goals and gauge effectiveness. Purpose Fundamental to the effective operation of drug courts are coordinated management, monitoring, and evaluation systems. The design and operation of an effective drug court program result from thorough initial planning, clearly define d program goals, and inherent flexibility to make modifications as necessary. The goals of the program should be described concretely and in measurable terms to provide accountability to funding agencies and policymak ers. And, since drug co urts will increasingly be asked to demonstrate tangible outcomes and cost-effectiveness, it is critical that the drug court be designed with the ability to gather and manage information for monitoring daily activities, evaluating the quality of services provided, and producing longitudinal evaluations. Management and monitoring systems provide timely and accurate information about program operations to the drug court's managers, enabling them to keep the program on course, identify developing problems, and make appropriate procedural changes. Clearly defined drug court goals shape the management information system, determine monitoring questions, and suggest methods for finding information to answer them. Program management pr ovides the information needed for day-to-day operations and for planning, monitoring, and evaluation. Program monitoring provides oversight and periodic measurements of the program' s performance against its st ated goals and objectives. Evaluation is the institutional process of ga thering and analyzing data to measure the accomplishment of the program's long-term go als. A process evalua tion appraise s progress in meeting operational and administrative goals (e.g., whether treatment services are implemented as intended). An outcome evaluation assesses the extent to which the program is reaching its long-term goals (e.g., reducing criminal recidivism). An effective design for an outcome evaluation uses a comparison group that does not receive drug court services. Although evaluation activities are often pla nned and implemented simultaneously, process evaluation information can be used more quickly in the early stages of drug court implementation. Outcome evaluation should be planned at the beginning of the program as it requires at least a year to compile results, esp ecially if past participan ts are to be found and interviewed. Evaluation strategies should reflect the signif icant coordination and the considerable time required to obtain measurable re sults. Evaluation studies are useful to everyone, including funding agencies and policymakers who may not be involved in the daily operations of the program. Information and conclu sions developed from periodic monitoring reports, process evaluation activities, and longitudinal evalua tion studies may be used to modify program 17 procedures, change therapeutic interventions , and make decisions about continuing or expanding the program. Information for management, monitoring, and ev aluation purposes may already exist within the court system and/or in the community treatment or supervision agencies (e.g., criminal justice data bases, psychosocial histories, and formal AOD assessments). Multiple sources of information enhance the credibility and pe rsuasiveness of conclusions drawn from evaluations. Performance Benchmarks 1. Management, monitoring, and evaluation processes begin with initia l planning. As part of the comprehensive planning process, drug court leaders and senior managers should establish specific and measurable goals that de fine the parameters of data collection and information management. An evaluator can be an important member of the planning team. 2. Data needed for program monitoring and management can be obtained from records maintained for day-to-day program operations, such as the numbers and genera l demographics of individuals screened for eligibility; the extent and nature of AOD problems among those assessed for possibl e participation in the program; and attendance records, progress reports, drug test results, and incidence of criminality among those accepted into the program. 3. Monitoring and management data are assembled in useful formats for regular review by program leaders and managers. 4. Ideally, much of the information needed for monitoring and evaluation is gathered through an automated system that can pr ovide timely and useful reports. If an automated system is not available manual da ta collection and report preparation can be streamlined. Additional monitoring informat ion may be acquired by observation and through program staff and participant interviews. 5. Automated manual information systems must ad here to written guid elines that protect against unauthorized disclosure of sensitiv e personal information about individuals. 6. Monitoring reports need to be reviewed at frequent intervals by program leaders and senior managers. They can be used to anal yze program operations, gauge effectiveness, modify procedures when necessary, and refine goals. 7. Process evaluation activities should be unde rtaken throughout the course of the drug court program. This activity is particularly important in the early stages of program implementation. 8. If feasible, a qualified independent evaluator should be selected and given responsibility for developing and conducting an evaluation design and for preparing interim and final reports. If an independent evaluation is unav ailable the drug court program designs and implements its own evaluation, based on guidance available through the field: 18 Judges, prosecutors, the defense bar, treatment staff, and others design the evaluation collaboratively with the evaluator. Ideally, an independent evaluator will help the information systems expert design and implement the management information system. The drug court program ensures that the evaluator has access to relevant justice system and treatment information. The evaluator maintains continuing contact with the drug court and provides information on a regular basis. Preliminary reports may be reviewed by drug court program personnel and used as the basis for revising goals, policies, and procedures as appropriate. 9. Useful data elements to assist in management and monitoring may include, but are not limited to: The number of defendants screened for pr ogram eligibility and the outcome of those initial screenings. The number of persons admitted to the drug court program. Characteristics of prog ram participants, such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, family status, employment status, and educational level; cu rrent charges; criminal justice history; AOD treatment health treatm ent history; medical needs (including detoxification); and nature an d severity of AOD problems. Number and characteristics of participants (e.g., duration of treatment involvement, reason for discharge fr om the program). Number of active cases. Patterns of drug use as measur ed by drug test results. Aggregate attendance data and general treatment progress measurements. Number and characteristics of persons who graduate or complete treatment successfully. Number and characteristics of persons who do not graduate or complete the program. Number of participants who fail to appear at drug court hear ings and number of bench warrants issued for participants. Rearrests during involvement in the drug court program and type of arrest(s). Number, length, and reasons for incar cerations during and subsequent to involvement in the drug court program. 10. When making comparisons for evaluation pur poses, drug courts s hould consider the following groups: Program graduates. Program terminations. 19 Individuals who were referred to, but did not appear for, treatment. Individuals who were not referred for drug court services. 11. At least six months after exiting a drug cour t program, comparison gr oups (listed above) should be examined to determine long-term effects of the program. Data elements for follow-up evaluation may include: Criminal behavior/activity. Days spent in custody on all offenses from date of acceptance into the program. AOD use since leaving the program. Changes in job skills and employment status. Changes in literacy and other educational attainments. Changes in physical and mental health. Changes in status of family relationships. Attitudes and perceptions of pa rticipation in the program. Use of health care and other social services. 12. Drug court evaluations should consider the use of cost-benefit analysis to examine the economic impact of program services. Importa nt elements of cost -benefit analysis include: Reductions in court costs, including judici al, counsel, and investigative resources. Reductions in costs related to law enforcement and corrections. Reductions in health care utilization. Increased economic productivity. 20 Key Component #9 Continuing interdisciplinary educat ion promotes effective drug court planning, implementa tion, and operations. Purpose Periodic education and training ensures that th e drug court's goals and objectives, as well as policies and procedures, are un derstood not only by the drug court leaders and senior managers, but also by those in directly involved in the prog ram. Education and training programs also help maintain a high level of professionalism, provide a forum for solidifying relationships among criminal justice and AOD treatment personnel, and promote a spirit of commitment and collaboration. All drug court staff should be involved in education and training, even before the first case is heard. Interdisciplinary education exposes crimin al justice officials to treatment issues, and treatment staff to criminal justice issues. It also develops shared understandings of the values, goals, and operating procedures of both the treatment and the justice system components. Judges and court personnel typically need to le arn about the nature of AOD problems and the theories and practices supporting specific treatment approaches. Treatment providers typically need to become familiar with criminal justice accountability issues and court operations. All need to unders tand and comply with drug testing standards and procedures. For justice system or other officials not di rectly involved in the program's operations, education provides an overview of the mission, goals, and operating pr ocedures of the drug court. A simple and effective method of educating new drug court staff is to visit an existing court to observe its operations and as k questions. On-site experience with an operating drug court provides an opportunity for new drug court staff to talk to their peers directly and to see how their particular role functions. Performance Benchmarks 1. Key personnel have attained a specific level of basic education, as defined in staff training requirements and in the written operating procedur es. The operating procedures should also define requirement s for the continuing education of each drug court staff member. 2. Attendance at education and training sessions by all drug court pe rsonnel is essential. Regional and national drug court training provide critical information on innovative developments across the Nation. Sessions are most productive when drug court personnel attend as a group. Credits for c ontinuing professional education should be offered, when feasible. 21 3. Continuing education institutionalizes the dr ug court and moves it beyond its initial identification with the key staff who may ha ve founded the program and nurtured its development. 4. An education syllabus and curriculum are deve loped, describing the drug court's goals, policies, and procedures. Topics might include: Goals and philosophy of drug courts. The nature of AOD abuse, its treatment and terminology. The dynamics of abstinence and techniques for preventing relapse. Responses to relapse and to noncompliance with other program requirements. Basic legal requirements of the drug court program and an overview of the local criminal justice system's policies, procedures, and terminology. Drug testing standards and procedures. Sensitivity to racial, cultural, ethnic, gender , and sexual orientation as they affect the operation of the drug court. Interrelationships of co-occurring conditi ons such as AOD abuse and mental illness (also known as \"d ual diagnosis\"). Federal, State, and local c onfidentiality requirements. 22 Key Component #10 Forging partnerships among drug c ourts, public agencies, and community-based organizations generates local support and enhances drug court program effectiveness. Purpose Because of its unique position in the criminal justice system, a drug court is especially wel l suited to develop coalitions among private co mmunity-based organizati ons, public criminal justice agencies, and AOD treatment delivery systems. Forming such coalitions expands the continuum of services available to drug cour t participants and informs the community about drug court concepts. The drug court is a partnership among or ganizations\u2014public, private, and community- based\u2014dedicated to a coordina ted and cooperative approach to the AOD offender. The drug court fosters systemwide involvement through its commitment to share responsibility and participation of program pa rtners. As a part of, and as a leader in, the formation and operation of community pa rtnerships, drug courts can help restore public faith in the criminal justice system. Performance Benchmarks 1. Representatives from the court, community organizations, law enforcement, corrections, prosecution, defense counsel, supervisor y agencies, treatment and rehabilitation providers, educators, health and social se rvice agencies, and the faith community meet regularly to provide guidance and direction to the drug court program. 2. The drug court plays a pivotal role in forming linkages between community groups and the criminal justice system. The linkages are a conduit of information to the public about the drug court, and conversely, from th e community to the court about available community services and local problems. 3. Partnerships between drug courts and law enforcement and/or community policing programs can build effective links between the court and offenders in the community. 4. Participation of public and pr ivate agencies, as well as community-based organizations, is formalized through a steering committee. The steering committee aids in the acquisition and distribution of resources. An especially effective way for the steering committee to operate is through the formation of a nonprofit corporation structur e that includes all the principle drug court partners, provides policy guidance, and acts as a conduit for fundraising and resource acquisition. 23 5. Drug court programs and services are sensitive to and demonstrate awareness of the populations they serve and the communities in which they operate. Drug courts provide opportunities for community involvement thro ugh forums, informational meetings, and other community outreach efforts. 6. The drug court hires a profe ssional staff that reflects the population served, and the drug court provides ongoing cultural competence training. 24 Appendix 1: Drug Court Standards Committee Bill Meyer, Chairman Judge, Denver Drug Court Denver, CO Ed Brekke Administrator Civil & Criminal Operations Los Angeles Superior Court Los Angeles, CA Jay Carver Director, District of Columbia Pretrial Services Agency Washington, DC Caroline Cooper Director OJP Drug Court Clearinghouse and Technical Assistance Project American University Washington, DC Jane Kennedy Executive Director TASC of King County Seattle, WA Barry Mahoney President The Justice Management Institute Denver, CO John Marr CEO Choices Unlimited Las Vegas, NV Carlos J.
