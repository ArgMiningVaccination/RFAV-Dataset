Method 1 - Differen ce in the proportion of vaccinated children, betw een households that answered the telephone versus those that did not answer the telephone.

If you want to determ ine the im pact of receiv ing a phone call on the vaccination rate, you m ight check to see whether those who answered the telephone were more likely to have their children vaccinated than those who did not .

This is sim ilar to the random drawing done in a clinical tr ial, where the treatm ent/dru g is adm inistered rando mly so as to be received by one group of patients but not the other. We can exploit this random drawing of 60,000 households to estim ate the impact of the Vaccination 100% Campaign. The idea is th at the 60,000 households that re ceived telephon e calls fro m Vaccination 100% (now referred to as the 'treatm ent' group) should be identical to the 200,000 other Nagudian households (now referred to as the 'control' group) that had children in 1999, in term s of observable and non- observable characteristics. The only difference between the first and second group s is that the firs t group received a telephone call and the second did not. Table 4 compares th e 'treatm ent' group and the 'control' group on the basis of observable ch aracteris tics.
