When to Visit a Naturopathic Clinic When patients visit the Integrative Health Calgary naturopathic clinic for the first time, they often say they are \"sick and tired of feeling sick and tired.\" If you are not looking, feeling or performing at your best, then it's likely time to see a naturopathic doctor. Conventional Western doctors and pharmaceuticals tend to treat symptoms, as opposed to causes and roots of health issues. Their methods can be valuable tools, however they do not tell the whole story or answer all the questions about more complex health concerns and their origins. Many patients feel as though their medical needs are not being validated or addressed, despite ongoing symptoms, with the result of ending up frustrated and disenfranchised. This is not the case at Integrative Health; you will experience a proactive approach to your health at our Calgary naturopathic clinic, and we will work with you until all of your issues are addressed.
