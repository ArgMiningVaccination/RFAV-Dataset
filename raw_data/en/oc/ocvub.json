It is also the website of the Fellowship, a study society whose members explore various spiritual traditions, and embrace a curriculum of Prayer & Meditation; Healing; Comparative Religion; Liturgical Studies, Spiritual Hierarchies, Kabbalah, and much more. [https://www.the-sanctuary.org.uk](https://www.the-sanctuary.org.uk) The Order and Fellowship members are not so much dedicated to established religion, although that must play a part, rather, it is to living the spiritual life that its members are drawn - which means the spiritualizing of human nature through Prayer, Meditation, Ritual, Study and love for all life through charitable or good works, by which we transform the lower instinctive nature into the higher spiritualise nature. To the readers who are drawn to such work then please do get in touch and let the will of God prevail (see the link to the [contact page](https://www.the-sanctuary.org.uk/contact) below). The Sanctuary is also a platform for the podcasts of Allan Armstrong, the prior-general of the Order, who was diagnosed in early 2021 with Pulmonary Fibrosis, probably caused by the Covid epidemic that was emerging at the time. He is now on oxygen 24/7 and unable to get out to meet people, thus, in podcasting and video conferencing (zoom) he has established an effective means of communicating with members of the Order, the Fellowship and other kindred-spirits. The subject-matter of his podcasts is concerned with the ancient tradition that constitutes the basis of order life & work. For example, Allan's introduction to Kabbalah in six episodes is based upon his book, The Secret Garden of the Soul, published in Bristol, 2008. It traces the origins of Kabbalah as an esoteric system unto the present time. Another example is an episode discussing the esoteric significance of the Sphere, focussing upon the subject and nature of Light, life and consciousness. See: [Kabbalah 6 - The Thirty-Two paths of Wisdom](https://www.the-sanctuary.org.uk/the-secret-garden-of-the-soul-part-6-the-thirty-two-paths-of-wisdom); Also, [The Sphere ](https://www.the-sanctuary.org.uk/the-sphere) Preparations are underway for an online seminar in the summer of 2023 concerning the history, of the Order, the Fellowship, and work of its members. Attendance will be free of charge, but donations are welcomed. Any who may be interested in attending, (space is limited) do let us know using the contact page below.

Forest bathing emerged in the 1980s in Japan as a physiological and psychological exercise called shinrin-yoku (\"forest bathing\" or \"breathing in the forest atmosphere\") which bridges the gap between us and the natural world. [https://quantumblooms.co.uk/ols/products/norwegian-forest-bathing-spritzer-100ml/](https://quantumblooms.co.uk/ols/products/norwegian-forest-bathing-spritzer-100ml) This Japanese practice is a process of relaxation; which isn't a simple walk in the woods, but a conscious and contemplative practice of being deeply immersed in the sights, sounds and aromas of the forest. The soothing calming method of being quiet amongst the trees, observing and sensing nature around you whilst breathing in deeply can positively benefit both children and adults to de-stress, uplift mood, boost health and help find a sense of well-being and allowing the nervous system to reset itself, in a natural way.). When living in built-up city and urban areas it offers a twofold effect: an eco-antidote to tech- burnout and as inspiration to reconnect with and protect the country's trees and forests. Intuitively, psychologically and spiritually as humans, we know the soothing revitalizing, and awe-inspiring effects of being in nature or viewing forests, the plants, and flowers of urban parks and natural green open spaces The Japanese quickly embraced this form of eco-therapy or forest medicine and understood that \"when are in harmony with the natural world we can begin to heal, be in tune where we are refreshed and restored.\" It wasn't until the 1990s, that researchers began exploring the physiological benefits of forest bathing, and then provided the science to support what we already innately knew. Although the Japanese are credited with the concept, many ancient cultures have long recognized the significance of the natural world on the health of humanity as a powerful way to relax and unwind. Norway was one such culture where the harsh cold climates and the midnight sun create a robust and resilient habitat. The Three Key Benefits of Forest Bathing - Decrease negative moods, anxiety, depression, fatigue, and brain fog; - Boost immunity and uplifts mood; - Reduction in systolic blood pressure; - Reduced concentrations of stress hormones in men and women and enhanced the activity of white blood cells known as natural killer cells. A unique, proprietary, and patented blend of therapeutic infusion of wild-crafted flowers, and plant stem cells sourced from Norway's pristine nature, fjords, tundra, and boreal forests. And essential oils of Spruce, Pine, Hinoki, Rose Damask, Vetiver, Neroli, Bergamot and Eucalyptus all contribute to a forest bathing experience. The Norwegian Spritz has a grounding, cleansing, and balancing effect on the aura and subtle bodies. As Studies have shown. forest bathing not only improves immune response, reduce blood pressure, calm the mind. but also has a natural antiviral and antibacterial effect. Uplifting and energizing, the Norwegian Spritzer encourages clarity of thought and emotional calm, leaving you feeling clean, centred, protected, and in control of your personal space. The Spritz fine-tunes the vibrational frequency, like a tuning fork for an instrument, and raises the overall vibration, aiding meditation and attunement to your original DNA and multidimensional Self.

Our students come from a variety of backgrounds both in conventional and holistic disciplines. This allows an exchange of information and experience that enriches the learning experience. Courses are mixture of leading-edge, scientifically based theory and clinical and practical tuition. Students are encouraged to explore and develop their gifts and talents in bringing their unique experience to the disciplines taught. Students are thus empowered. Top: Jonathan Lawrence BA DO Cert Ed and Rosemary Lawrence Dip BFD Cert Clin Hom Cert Ed Bottom: Craniosacral Course 2019 Small groups help to facilitate this experience. Turning Point teachers are enthusiastic and experienced practicing therapists who keep their knowledge up to date. The philosophy of Turning Point encompasses the idea that medicine is an art informed by science. We believe that the conventional materialist paradigm is very much out of date and that scientific knowledge has now reached a point where much of holistic medicine can incorporated into a new paradigm. Turning Point courses introduce the concepts of research and encourage students to critically evaluate current information. Craniosacral therapy is based on the relationship between the structure and function of the body and the expression of health. Specific, gentle and skilled manipulation can restore the structure-function relationship supporting the patients' own homeostatic mechanisms. This non-invasive and safe therapy can be used on patients of all ages from the new-born to the elderly. The Practitioner Course consists of 8 modules over 5 weekends and 20 hours Zoom support days. In addition, students must complete a portfolio of case studies and complete an exam. Practical skills are assessed during the course. This course is recognized by the CMA. The 2024 dates are: 24th, 25th February, 23rd, 24th March, 27th, 28th April, 8th, 9th June and 6th, 7th July. This course is held in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. This course is led by Jonathan Lawrence. Homotoxicology is based on the idea that disease results from toxic load. In modern life we are subject to toxins from a variety of sources. This has the effect of stressing the immune system leading to ill health. Accurate prescribing can help the body gently detoxify aiding the restoration of homeostasis. The remedies used are single potency homeopathic remedies or combinations of remedies to achieve a specific physiological response. The online training is via the Society of Homotoxicology, UK. Contact us for access to this course. We provide further courses in Electro Acupuncture According to Voll (EAV) for suitably qualified students. This involves electro-acupuncture assessment of meridians and clinical application of findings. Training is via small tutorial groups led by Rosemary Lawrence.

Homeopathic remedies, some of which can be purchased over the counter can be extremely helpful in these situations. However, they will only offer short-term relief and it is recommended that help is obtained from a qualified homeopathic practitioner. [https://www.homeopathinessex.co.uk/](https://www.homeopathinessex.co.uk/) At my practice, Sayer Complementary Health, based in Burnham on Crouch, Essex, I see the majority of my homeopathic and nutritional clients on-line with either Zoom, Skype, Messenger or Facetime and this allows the client to reap the benefit of the consultation without the need for them to travel. It also enables the client to make best use of their time since adding travel time into the consultation time can mean that they are out of work/home/ for some considerable time. An initial consultation can take anything from 1-2 hours depending upon the client and their presenting concerns. Homeopathic remedies are chosen to suit the person's situation and this is where the full consultation comes into its own. A homeopath will not prescribe an 'anxiety' remedy without knowing the full symptom picture given by the client. Homeopathy can help a wide range of ailments and is definitely not a 'one size fits all' system. Aside from my homeopathic practice, I also provide training courses in Homeopathy and Reiki. The Homeopathy at Home course is designed to help you learn how to select homeopathic remedies that will address minor ailments such as coughs, colds, headaches and sore throats and may even negate the need for a visit to the doctor. Homeopathic remedies are non-toxic, non-addictive and safe for all ages. This course is easily accessible via Zoom. The Homeopathic Practitioner Diploma course is an in-depth apprenticeship style course spread over three years. You will learn about the history of homeopathy and the philosophy of working with acute cases through to understanding the depth of a more chronic case and how to prepare a case protocol. Anatomy and physiology as well as pathology and disease are also covered. Home study and written assignments are essential to the course. Upon successful completion of all the necessary criteria you will be entitled to register as a homeopathic practitioner with a registering organization and build your career as a homeopath. As a Reiki Master/Teacher I hold regular Reiki courses in Essex and while social distancing is being practiced, Reiki distant healing is being sent regularly to all her Reiki students. For information there are three levels of Reiki that are taught. Level one and two are one-day courses. Shoden, level one opens you up to the healing power of Reiki and enables you to carry out Reiki healing on yourself and your family. Reiki level 2 Okuden, is suitable for people who have already studied level one and are familiar with the Reiki healing energy. At the end of level two, you will be able to offer Reiki sessions to the general public although you will need to have the relevant complementary health insurance cover in place to do so. Pre-course material is provided for both Shoden and Okuden so that you may study the materials prior to attending the practical course. A Certificate of Attendance is provided on completion. Should you wish to take your Reiki one stage further then the Reiki Master/Teacher Course also comes complete with a comprehensive manual as well as audio and visual materials and it is this course you would need to undertake in order for you to be able to prepare others on their journey with Reiki. Reiki consultations are held in Burnham on Crouch, Essex.

A Beginner's Guide to ME-CFS - This Advice Applies Directly to Long Covid How can a book published in 2014, long before we'd ever heard of Covid, help to prevent the public health problem which currently threatens to overwhelm not just health systems, but economic systems, worldwide? [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beginners-Guide-ME-CFS-Guides/dp/0957181744](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beginners-Guide-ME-CFS-Guides/dp/0957181744) A Beginner's Guide to ME/CFS focuses on the importance of rest, and the dangers of exercise to people suffering the illness (or illnesses) included within these labels. Rest? Just rest? Isn't that just giving up? Shouldn't we be fighting it? Our body, like that of every living creature, inhabits a world of predators, some external, but most living complex lives within - bacteria, fungi, viruses; and our body has developed many, extremely complex ways of counteracting these. This includes ways of identifying and developing defences against ones not previously encountered. But these processes require energy. The term for the entirety of these incredibly complex processes is the 'immune system'. Medicine does not, in itself, cure illnesses. It can only help the immune system do so, in a variety of ways. Vaccines help speed up and enhance the immune system's ability to identify and produce cells to attack aspects of a virus's functioning. Specific drugs can kill specific pathogens. Many drugs simply suppress symptoms caused by the immune system's attack on an invading pathogen, often having the effect of prolonging the illness itself. The rapidly evolving virus which continues to cause successive waves of Covid is extremely complex in its nature, and its effects on a range of organ systems. We now know that this includes the ability to cause a chronic, disabling illness, virtually indistinguishable from ME/CFS,[1] and that the numbers of those affected already runs into the millions, and that these numbers are already having a noticeable effect on a diminishing workforce. Resting, as completely as possible, as soon as possible from the inception of any illness, but especially from a potentially disabling one, is the opposite of 'giving in'. Your immune system, encountering this new threat, needs all your physical energy to be available in its battle to save you, There's even a part of your brain that tells you to crawl into a warm, safe space, and do nothing - while your immune system does its work. Those who tell you to fight this feeling, get up, carry on, don't give in, completely misunderstand your situation. It's your immune system that's doing the fighting! Making such misguided physical efforts, which are advised in too many Long Covid rehabilitation centres, could cripple your immune system's ability to overcome what is making you ill - and condemn you to the life of disability which many Long Covid sufferers are now experiencing. The advice in A Beginner's Guide to ME/CFS applies directly to today's new challenge, Long Covid, and needs to be as widespread as possible. Reference Wong TL, Weitzer DJ.

It's more important than ever to support immune health and ensure an appropriate response to danger signals as well as recovery after the danger is quelled. Inflammation With an acute response of the immune system triggered by infection, inflammation occurs as a natural defense followed by a process of self-healing. Chronic and systemic inflammation, however, triggered by constant physical, chemical, or metabolic stimuli, DAMPs released by damaged cells, and environmental insults, leads to damage of tissues and organs. Excessive and prolonged production of inflammatory mediators plays a role in many chronic diseases; autoimmune disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, arthritis, fibromyalgia, in addition to many others (probably including long COVID as well.) [https://cellsciencesystems.com/](https://cellsciencesystems.com/) Age Related Chronic Inflammation Aging and associated chronic inflammation, referred to as \"inflammaging,\" contributes to significant risk of morbidity and mortality. Inflammatory burden depletes immune resources, causes cell senescence, drives cardiovascular disease, autoimmunity, and other chronic issues - compromising immune health and reducing protection against foreign invaders. The new testing involves: - Testing the responses of the JAK-STAT (Janus kinase Signal Transduction and Activators of Transcription) pathway, an important pathway in all immune cells, playing a major role in transferring cytokine signals from cell surface receptors to the nucleus, and activating genes to create the exact protein needed for the targeted immune response. This pathway tends to be reduced in aging individuals resulting in imbalanced immune responses, poor immune health, and the perpetuation of elevated inflammatory mediators. - Measurement of key cytokines and chemokines in the blood. These include: - CXCL-9 CXC-2 CXCL-2 - OL-6 - TNF-alpha - IL-1b - Elafin - A very important marker and predictor of health, the NLR; or neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio - Telomere length assessment. Many of the consequences common in the elderly population, can be prevented by making lifestyle choices that support the immune system and immune senescence can be reversed.

A clear and passionate truth warrior, Ronnie Cummins has led the charge in the US and internationally to change the landscape of the food and agriculture industry by fighting for the elimination of toxic chemicals and genetic modification of food, and by educating farmers and consumers on how to grow and access clean organic healthful foods. Ronnie Cummins, together with his wife, Rose Welch, are the founders of Organic Consumers Association and its international affiliates, Regeneration International and V\u00eda Org\u00e1nica. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvRNdHdTjVI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvRNdHdTjVI) Organic Consumers Association strengthens the health freedom movement by collaborating with hundreds of organizations in our country and around the world. Their role of constantly providing important and timely information to organizations and consumers about the status and politics of the food supply has been essential for taking action for change. Ronnie's knowledge and understanding of the role of government in our lives and how we must be vigilant about freedom is witnessed in his most recent co-authorship of a book The Truth About COVID-19: Exposing the Great Reset, Lockdowns, Vaccine Passports, and the New Normal. Of the nine chapters in the book, four of them were written entirely by Ronnie and they were a strong expression of health freedom principles in a pivotal time when millions of people were under great pressure to conform to Covid mandates. The book became a national best seller before the end of 2021. OCA has been a member organization of the US Health Freedom Congress for the past two decades. In 2016 the US Health Freedom Congress was honoured to have Ronnie Cummins, story-teller extraordinaire, tell his own profound life story as the Keynote speaker. ( [Click Here to View His Speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvRNdHdTjVI)). We will dearly miss Ronnie Cummins. Our heart goes out to his wife Rose, and their son Adrian, and entire family.
