Many people don't realize that most stones are unsafe for using in the traditional way of preparing crystal elixirs (where crystals are submerged into some water and charged in sun or [moonlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UZSuTkIab8)). Before creating any crystal elixirs, you should ALWAYS check that the stones used in your essence are non-toxic. Crystal essences and crystal elixirs should only be prepared using the alternative method of preparation, which I show you below. Please note that radioactive stones should NEVER be used in the preparation of crystal elixirs or essences, not even by the alternative method! I've included a list of many unsafe stones at the bottom of this post, but if you're unsure whether a stone is safe to use for crystal elixirs, don't use it - when in doubt, leave it out! How to Safely Create Crystal Elixirs: - Set a purpose or intention for your crystal elixirs - Choose stones related to your purpose - Check to be sure that your chosen stones are not radioactive - Place your chosen stones inside of a sterilized glass container (containing no water) - Place this small glass container into a larger sterilized glass container that does contain water (the stones NEVER make direct contact with the water, but their energetic vibration is allowed to be transmitted through the glass container into the water) - Cover the larger container with a lid or some plastic wrap - Allow your stones to sit in the water for at least a few hours. - Add grain alcohol (or a food-grade alcohol that is at least 90% alcohol - 180 proof) as a preservative in a 1:1 ratio of alcohol to water into a freshly sterilized, glass dropper bottle or jar - this means that your finished elixir will be 50% alcohol and 50% water. So, if you have 2 ounces of energy-infused water, measure out 2 ounces of alcohol for the finished elixir. It is imperative for safety that you add the correct type and quantity of alcohol for preserving your elixir. - Removing the small, inner container with the stone, and pouring the correct amount of energy-infused water (measured out according to the 1:1 ratio described in step #9 above), into the glass bottle with the alcohol. - Label your elixir with the stone(s) used and the date it was bottled. - Store your bottled elixir in a cool, dark place for up to 30 days (if you see any signs of microbial growth, discard the bottle with its contents and do not use it). Be sure to keep essences & elixirs out of reach of children and pets. - These elixirs are recommended for external use only (try placing a few drops in your bathwater, adding a few drops to a dish of fresh water used for scrying divination, or add a few drops to a small offering dish in your sacred space or on your altar (as long as it's out of reach of children and pets). Learning all of the steps to safely create your own crystal elixirs takes quite a bit of training (more than can be summarized in this post), but these are the basic steps so you can understand the general process. [MinDat](http://mindat.org) is a great resource for checking the [chemical composition of your crystals](http://mindat.org) to help you determine whether or not they may contain toxic elements or if they may be radioactive. Below I've included a list of cited references to stones that are unfit for elixir preparation (along with the explanation of why these stones shouldn't be used with the traditional method). This list also includes radioactive stones that should be avoided in both the traditional and alternative methods of creating crystal elixirs. This is by NO MEANS an exhaustive list of all toxic stones. You should ONLY create crystal elixirs if you have been properly [trained in gem elixir preparation](https://loveandlightschool.com/courses/product/gem-waters-crystals-essences-and-elixirs-and-vibrational-sprays-online-class/) and if you are absolutely certain as to the safety of your stones. I can't stress this enough...if you aren't 100% certain as to the safety of a crystal for elixir preparation, then don't use it! Again, this is not a complete list, but it can help you rule out some of the most common stones that should be avoided. If the stone you're using is known by more than one name, be sure to check the list under all known names for the stone. Additionally, this list includes other safety considerations, like stones that may give off harmful dust, stones that are toxic to handle with bare hands, etc. However, just because a stone is listed here doesn't mean it's necessarily unsafe to handle (as there are many on this list simply due to their being unsuitable for elixir preparation). BUT...there are quite a lot of stones on this list that are completely unsafe to handle (or even be near in the case of radioactive stones), so it's important to consider how you'll be working with the stone (in an elixir, placing it on the body, holding it in the hands, etc.) to determine whether or not it's appropriate based on the information below. Just as I've explained above for elixir preparation, if you're uncertain of a stone's safe handling requirements, it's best to do your research about the chemical composition and safe handling suggestions prior to working with it. -A- Abalone - Harmful or toxic stone. Organic, may contain bacteria as well as pollutants from toxic materials from the water it forms in.
