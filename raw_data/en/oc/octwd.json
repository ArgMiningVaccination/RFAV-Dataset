Ornish has focused on heart disorder and on cancer; first he did \"The Lifestyle Heart Trial\" and after that the Prostate Cancer Trial. In the Lifestyle Heart Trial Ornish documented that the most efficient and lasting way to cure a patient with a heart disorder is by life-style intervention(2,3,4). Dean Ornish intervenes, not only on the physical level, but also on the emotional, mental and spiritual levels, with love and spirituality being the most important (5). The tradition of holistic medicine goes all the way back to the Hippocratic physicians (6), and Dean Ornish seems to work in this tradition. In the same way as the traditional holistic doctors of Europe Ornish believes that love and sexuality are the major healing powers: \"I happen to think that healing energy and erotic energy is just two different forms of the same thing.\" (1) 80% OF THE PATIENTS ARE CLINICALLY CURED AND PAIN FREE AFTER ONE MONTH (NNT=1) When the patients understand the association between life-style and health and change the way they think, feel and live, they heal. Ornish has shown us that it really is that simple, also when it comes to the most severe physical diseases like coronary vessel stenosis in the heart and prostate cancer. It normally takes the heart patients less than a month to reopen an almost closed coronary artery (2,3,4), which is lightening fast! How efficient is his medicine then? Well, according to the published statistics, about 80% of his heart patients are cured by the intervention, both in short term (1-3 month) and in long term (3 years) (1,4). If you look at his prostate cancer patients you find the same pattern (1,7). So if you accept the documentations Ornish has published of his holistic healings of extremely ill patients in the Lancet, JAMA, and other highly esteemed journals, there can be no doubt: Ornish and his team has found the key to fast and efficient healing. According to most of the published statistics 80% of the patients are clinically cured and pain free in only one month after the initiation of treatment (4)... and that is truly miraculous medicine. The Number Needed to Treat in Ornish clinical trials is one, both in his heath trial and in his cancer trial (NNT=1) and this is truly remarkable. Dear Ornish holistic medicine is so good, actually, that most people out of USA do not believe in his results. ACKNOWLEDGMENT BY MEDICARE USA believes in Dean Ornish. MEDICARE has now acknowledged his method, which means that US citizens can be cured by holistic medicine paid by the US government. And in the academic world, a CAM revolution is happening now. Numerous hospitals have launched CAM programs. George Washington University in Washington DC has a CAM clinic, and UCLA has had a CAM clinic for a decade. The integrative hospital programs at Columbia-New York Presbyterian utilize mind-body medicine. Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York has developed an integrative medicine center. Other academic medical centers that offer integrative clinics include University of Arizona, Dartmouth, Duke, Harvard, the University of Maryland, the University of Minnesota, Stanford and Tufts (8). Interestingly what drives this development seems to be... money (8). One angioplasty costs $31.000 and one bypass surgery $46.000, and these procedures will often have to be repeated, while a life-saving holistic medicine intervention costs at Dean Ornish own clinic costs only $7.000 - once and for all. The cost in Europe of a chronic patient being treated again and again is often hundreds of thousand EUROs. Wouldn't we like to get cured for 5.000EUROs in Europe? Of course we would. But we are in general not informed about this possibility. So huge national savings, and not appreciation of the magical results for the patients, seems to be what has made Dean Ornish become acknowledged and highly respected in the USA. HAS DEAN ORNISH'S HOLISTIC MEDICINE SIGNIFICANT SIDE EFFECTS? We all know that surgery has side effects like infections in wounds, and sudden deaths from reactions to anesthetics. In general we know that drugs always have some adverse effects. It is therefore also remarkable that holistic mind-body-medicine the way it is practices by Dean Ornish - at least according to all the research Ornish has published in the field - has no known significant side effects. Well, holistic medicine is not really Ornish's invention. It has been used for two millennia (6). It was actually the great medicine every physician in Europe used before the industrial age. And holistic medicine is known to have no side effects; the Hippocratic doctors found this very important as said: \"First do no harm\". GIVE DR. ORNISH THE NOBEL PRIZE Ornish has declared himself a \"non-drug non-surgery doctor\". We would describe him as a \"quality of life doctor\", as he heals his patients through making them happy. More correctly he helps them to improve their own happiness, because holistic medicine is about self-awareness, self- knowledge, and self-insight. Among doctors and experts in Europe few seem to know what Dean Ornish has accomplished. Most national health authorities in the European countries seem to know little about the great benefits and safety of holistic medicine, documented by Dean Ornish. Therefore: Make Ornish's work visible to them. Give Dean Ornish the global acknowledgement this man's work truly deserves. Let his medicine be known to everybody, and let it be used by the millions of patients who needs it urgently. Ornish showed us all that this medicine, the classical medicine of Europe, is not obsolete, is not old fashioned and tired. It is super- powerful, highly efficient and totally safe for the patients. It is the kind of medicine we need today and in the future. So - please give Dean Ornish the Nobel Prize for making the medicine work, in a time where nobody believes in healing. The world needs his effective and safe medicine urgently.
