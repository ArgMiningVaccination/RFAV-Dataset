In the early 19th century, a major emphasis in higher education was on themastery of Greek and Latin, with little attention given tomodern or contemporary subjects. The founders of NewYork University intended to enlarge the scope of highereducation to meet the needs of individuals aspiring tocareers in business, industry, science, and the arts, as wellas in law, medicine, and the ministry. The opening of theUniversity of London in 1828 convinced New Yorkers thatNew York, too, should have a university. The first president of New York University's gov- erning council was Albert Gallatin, former adviser toThomas Jefferson and secretary of the treasury in Jefferson'scabinet. Gallatin and his cofounders said that the new uni-versity was to be a \"national university\" that would providea \"rational and practical education for all.\" The result of the founders' foresight is today a university that is recognized both nationally and interna-tionally as a leader in scholarship. Of the more than 3,000colleges and universities in America, only 60 institutionsare members of the distinguished Association of AmericanUniversities. New York University is one of the 60.Students come to the University from all 50 states andfrom over 130 foreign countries. The University includes 14 schools and colleges at six major centers in Manhattan. In addition, the Universityoperates a branch campus program in Rockland County atSt. Thomas Aquinas College. Certain of the University'sresearch facilities, notably the Nelson Institute ofEnvironmental Medicine, are located in Sterling Forest,near Tuxedo, New York. Although overall the University islarge, the divisions are small- to moderate-sized units\u2014AN INTRODUCTION TO New York University 5 INTRODUCTION1832 College of Arts and Science 1835 School of Law 1841 School of Medicine 1865 College of Dentistry 1886 Graduate School of Arts and Science 1890 Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development 1900 Leonard N.

Unlike other institutions at the time, it was to be nonsectarian and to produce a different sort of elite citizen, not born to privilege butset apart for leadership by talent and effort. To that end, it provided a more practicaleducation, what the 19th century called \"Useful Knowledge.\" Thus, in addition to offering the standard classical curriculum, early NYU was also a center for science. Samuel F. B. Morse, after whom the current core curriculum isnamed, invented the telegraph while teaching art and design; John W . Draper inventedmodern photography; and the American Chemical Society was founded here. In the arts and culture, too, it can be argued that the College not only partici- pated in but also generated much of the creative energy that has characterizedGreenwich Village. The original University Building housed ateliers that were the fore-runners of the current downtown art scene. And although Henry WadsworthLongfellow was turned down for a teaching post, literature thrived, with UniversityBuilding even featured in an 1861 novel by Theodore Winthrop. Finally, this neighborhood and this institution have had a long tradition of social and political activism\u2014from the Stonecutters Riot over the construction of theUniversity's first building in 1834 to the tragic Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in1911, a major event in U.S. labor history that took place in what is now the BrownBuilding. From its earliest days, then, the College on Washington Square has been at the cutting edge of intellectual, cultural, and social developments. In 1895, however,NYU's great chancellor, Henry McCracken, decided to reserve Washington Square forthe professional schools, which had proliferated under his leadership, and to moveUniversity College to a beautiful campus in the Bronx\u2014University Heights\u2014designedby Stanford White. The College's move to the Heights reflected McCracken's \"Ivy\" aspirations for the school and his successful effort to raise quality by attracting the best studentsnationally. Also relevant was the ascendant, nonurban collegiate ideal of a residentialcommunity, with fine teaching, extracurricular activities, fraternities, and intercolle-giate athletics.A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE College of Arts and Science 14 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE15 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCEA few years later an undergrad- uate presence was restored down-town with the opening of aCollegiate Division (1903), soon tobecome Washington Square College(1913). This school had a morediverse student body, opening itsdoors to women, recent immi-grants, commuters, and professionalstudents. For over 60 years, undergradu- ate liberal arts education at NYUtook place in two locations\u2014University College (and theEngineering School) at the Heightsand the College on WashingtonSquare, both offering excellent, butdifferent, educational and socialexperiences. In the 1970s, the College underwent yet another major trans-formation. In response to financial pressures, the Heights campus wasclosed in 1973, and UniversityCollege merged with WashingtonSquare College. The new institu-tion, which is now known simplyas the College of Arts and Science,is the beneficiary of both tradi-tions\u2014the Heights' residential andcollegiate culture and the Square'sprogressive urban focus. At thattime, a decision was also made tobuild aggressively for quality\u2014torecruit the very best faculty andstudents, to update and expand thephysical plant, and to create distin-guished programs both here andabroad. In recent years, the College has become recognized as a nationalleader for its efforts to reinvent aliberal arts education for the 21st century. With a challenging liberalarts core, the Morse Academic Plan,at the center of the curriculum, theCollege emphasizes student inquiryand research, offers unique opportu-nities for international and prepro-fessional study, and makes use ofthe city as a site for learning andservice. A liberal arts educationthus reconceived is not only person-ally enriching but also eminentlypractical in developing the skillsand perspectives essential to assumea leadership role in the 21st centu-ry. As the new millennium pro-ceeds, the College continues tobuild on its founders' goal of providing \"Useful Knowledge.\" 16 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE Left: Samuel F . B.

The MAP is named forSamuel F. B. Morse, an early faculty member of the University. Best known as inventor of the electric telegraph, Morse taught fine arts at NYU and was an eminentpainter. In his breadth of talent and high achievement as both an artist and scientist,Morse symbolizes the range of skills and interests that the MAP is designed to foster. The MAP provides a core academic experience for undergraduates at NYU. Through a challenging array of foundational courses, the program heightens culturalawareness, hones critical reading skills, and promotes creative and logical thinking. It alsogives students extensive practice writing and speaking English and proficiency in at leastone other language. Rather than specifying a fixed canon of knowledge, the MAP focuseson modes and methods of humanistic and scientific inquiry. In each case, students are freeto pursue particular interests by choosing among a number of courses. Students examineour contemporary culture\u2014its origins and social structures, its modes of expression, andits inherent diversity and evolving patterns of thought. In other classes, they consider theplace and importance of modern science\u2014its quantitative and analytical foundations, itsprocesses of reasoning, and its relationship to technology and to our views of the naturalworld. By helping them to broaden their perspectives, gain new pathways for intellectualinquiry, and develop the skills, background, and social awareness to thrive in dynamic cir-cumstances, the MAP thus seeks to prepare students for their later studies and to equipthem well for lives as thinking individuals and members of society.The Morse Academic Plan DIRECTOR OF THE MORSE ACADEMIC PLAN: Professor Borenstein DIRECTOR OF THE EXPOSITORY WRITING PROGRAM: Professor Hoy 23 MORSE ACADEMIC PLANProgramThe MAP has four components: 1. The Expository Writing Program 2. Study of a foreign language3. Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC) 4. Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) Though structured and integrated, the MAP curriculum affords stu-dents flexibility in a number ofways. It permits the choice of dif-ferent tracks in each component,the satisfaction of some courses by examination or AdvancedPlacement credit (foreign lan-guage, FSI), and the substitution of departmental courses (FCC,FSI). Given this flexibility, students work individually with advisers toplan course schedules that takeinto account their past preparation,current interests, and longer-termgoals. While there is no prescribedschedule of courses that will beappropriate for every student, thefollowing broad guidelines shouldbe kept in mind: Incoming freshmen should com- plete their MAP courses by theend of sophomore year. This willleave them free in their juniorand senior years to focus on their major and elective courses. Somescience majors, engineering stu-dents, premedical students, andstudents placed in theInternational Writing Workshopsequence may need to delaystarting, and thus finishing, acomponent of the MAP for asemester or more. Students whopursue international study mayalso need to delay completingtheir MAP courses beyond thesophomore year. Students must complete Writing the Essay (V40.0100) duringtheir first year. Those placed into24 MORSE ACADEMIC PLANthe prose writing or Inter- national Writing Workshopsequences must begin in theirfirst semester and must registerfor their remaining writingcourse(s) in the semester(s)immediately following. Although Freshman Honors Seminars are not a part of theMAP , qualifying students arestrongly urged to register for one of these classes in their firstsemester. These seminars withdistinguished faculty memberspromise an intellectually stimu-lating experience right at the startof college. In designing the MAP , the faculty sought to ensure that all studentswould receive a broad exposure tothe liberal arts early in their college careers. With this wide academichorizon, the MAP encourages stu-dents to discover new intellectualinterests outside their intendedareas of specialization and to pursuethose interests with elective coursesoutside their majors in their laterundergraduate years. Expository WritingIt is difficult to exaggerate the value of clear and effective writing.The Expository Writing Programat NYU assumes that writing isnot merely a useful skill but also away of learning and knowing. Itscourses focus on the examination ofevidence, the development of ideas,and the clear expression of thoseideas in a variety of different kindsof essays. In these writing courses, students routinely move fromexploration to argument as theyread and make use of varioustexts\u2014written, visual, experien-tial\u2014to create a spectrum of per-suasive essays. Examined textsbecome more complex, and thewriting tasks more difficult, as stu-dents grapple with intriguingquestions that lead to richer ideas and more interesting forms ofexpression. The essays studentswrite become more formal andargumentative as the semester'swork progresses. For a complete description of the curriculum, see the Expository Writing Program (40) section of this bulletin. Foreign LanguageThe study of foreign languages is an integral part of a liberal artseducation. It nurtures an awarenessof the diversity of human cultureand serves the practical need forlanguage skills in fields such asgovernment, business, andresearch. New York University is aparticularly exciting setting forlanguage study because of its loca-tion in a great cosmopolitan city,its international student body, itsmany renowned language pro-grams and centers, and its numer-ous opportunities for study abroad. In addition to the foreign lan- guage courses offered for academiccredit, the College offers opportuni-ties for students of modern lan-guages to practice their skills inreal-world situations outside theclassroom. NYU Speaking Freely is afree, noncredit program that allowsstudents to practice their speakingand aural comprehension skills andto explore the linguistically diversecultures of New York City. For moreinformation about this popular pro-gram, contact the Office of theAssociate Dean for Students, SilverCenter, 100 Washington SquareEast, Room 909. Increasingly, college graduates must be prepared to function in aglobal society. Apart from theinherent interest of learning aboutother cultures, many NYU stu-dents take the opportunity tostudy or travel abroad as prepara-tion for their future careers. For more information about studyabroad programs, visit the Officeof Global Programs, 110 East 14thStreet, New York, NY 10003-4170, and consult the Programs Abroad section of this bulletin. Requirement: To fulfill the for- eign language component of theMorse Academic Plan, studentsmust show or attain proficiency ina foreign language through theintermediate level. Ordinarily, thisis accomplished by the successfulcompletion of two years of lan-guage study in the College,through the second semester of aregular intermediate-level lan-guage sequence. Some languagesare also taught in intensive courses,allowing students to complete theequivalent of two years of study ina single year. After two years of college lan- guage study or the equivalentdemonstrated proficiency, studentsshould have gained a broad compe-tence in a language, but true flu-ency of written or oral expressionwill not usually have been devel-oped at this point. For this reason,all students are encouraged to con-tinue their language study beyondthe intermediate level. In particu-lar, students studying modern lan-guages will find it most beneficialto immerse themselves in the liv-ing culture of a language by study-ing, traveling, or working abroad. Likewise, students of all languages,whether ancient or modern, areencouraged to continue their stud-ies with elective courses in litera-ture at the advanced level. Exemptions: Students may fulfill the foreign language component ofthe MAP by presenting outstand-ing scores on the SAT Subject Testor Advanced Placement Test in aforeign language, or by passing adepartmental proficiency examina-tion. For further information onlanguage placement and exemp-tion, see \"Placement Examinations\"in the Academic Policies section of this bulletin. For AdvancedPlacement Test equivalencies, consult the chart in the Admission section, also in this bulletin. Students whose secondary schooling was in a language otherthan English and other than a lan-guage offered in the College, orwho complete the InternationalWriting Workshop sequence(V40.0004, V40.0009), areexempt from the foreign languagerequirement. Also exempt are stu-dents in the B.S./B.E. program. Courses: Listed below are courses covering the second semester of theintermediate level of languagestudy. Intensive courses, whichallow students to complete theequivalent of two years of study ina single year, are also listed where25 MORSE ACADEMIC PLANavailable.

Foundations of Contemporary CultureThe Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC) sequence of theMorse Academic Plan is a series offour coordinated courses in thehumanities and social sciences.Within each of the four offerings,students are free to pursue theirparticular interests through theirchoice of individual classes. Overall,the structure of the FCC ensuresthat every student in the Collegegains a common core of skills andexperiences in the liberal arts. In addition to the information on the FCC provided in this bul-letin, detailed descriptions of eachyear's course offerings may befound on the MAP Web site.CONVERSATIONS OF THE WEST Through exploration of contrasting and complementary works in thehumanities from different periods,Conversations of the West providesa historical, literary, and philosophi-cal context for education in the lib-eral arts. Students may choose fromfour tracks: Antiquity and theMiddle Ages, Antiquity and theRenaissance, Antiquity and theEnlightenment, and Antiquity andthe 19th Century. In each case, theclasses begin with works from someof the ancient civilizations that haveshaped the development of culturesin the West. Typically, the classeshave the following readings in com-mon: the books of Genesis andExodus from the HebrewScriptures, the Gospel According to Luke and Acts of the Apostles fromthe Christian New Testament, aPlatonic dialogue and a Sophocleanor Euripidean tragedy, Vergil'sAeneid , and Augustine's Confessions . In the second half of the course, thethemes and ideas emerging fromthese texts are followed as they aremaintained, reinterpreted, or dis-puted by later thinkers. Conversations of the West is not a survey but, rather, an examinationof how texts influence subsequentthinking, create traditions, andreflect societal ideals. Conversationsof the West thus aims to provide aricher understanding of how cul-tures are constructed, modified, andrepresented.26 MORSE ACADEMIC PLANWORLD CULTURES World Cultures prepares students for life in a globalized world byintroducing them to the ways inwhich humans come to understandthemselves as members of societiesand by fostering their appreciationof the dynamics of cultural interac-tion and influence. Individual sec-tions focus on specific social orcultural groups different from thedominant traditions of contempo-rary Europe and North America.They share a common concern toexamine the ways cultures haveinteracted, for example, throughtrade, colonization, and immigra-tion; how such groups definethemselves against internal andexternal differences; and how thedominant perspective of Westernmodernity both makes possibleand limits comprehension of theways in which people outside thatposition understand, experience,and imagine their lives. Offerings include emergent tra- ditions, diaspora formations, andsocieties understood as nationally,geographically, or culturally dis- tinct from the West. Coursesfocusing on ancient civilizationsapart from Greece and Rome arealso included. SOCIETIES AND THE SOCIAL SCIENCES Over the past several centuries, enormous social transformationshave taken place around the world.To understand the complexity ofthese phenomena, new methodshave been developed to study socie-tal structures and human behavior.Each of the courses under Societiesand the Social Sciences begins froma particular disciplinary approach,social concern, or topic, in order toorient students to the characteristicmethods of these social sciences.Students learn how issues are objec-tified for study, how data is col-lected and analyzed, and how newunderstanding is thereby achieved.Whether through an interdiscipli-nary approach, consideration oftheir historical development, orreflection on critical and positivis-tic debates, the courses help stu- dents both to appreciate the uniqueinsights afforded by these methodsand to recognize the limits of suchinquiry. In this way, students movebeyond the particular focus of theclass to a broader understanding ofmethods and problems in the socialsciences generally. EXPRESSIVE CULTURE In Expressive Culture, studentsexplore the complexities of artisticexpression by focusing on one offive media: sounds, images, words,performance, or film. Each courseintroduces requisite historical, for-mal, and critical vocabularies;examines fundamental issues asso-ciated with interpretation of thearts making use of these media;and investigates the complex rela-tions between artistic activity andother facets of social organization.The courses also make use, when-ever possible, of the rich culturalresources of New York City. Foundations of Scientific InquiryThe Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) component of theMorse Academic Plan is a series ofthree coordinated courses in quan-titative reasoning and the naturalsciences. Together, these coursesensure that every student in theCollege gains a fundamentalunderstanding of how mathematicsand laboratory experimentationadvance scientific investigation.While some students acquire thisbackground through course workoffered in the science majors, FSIcourses are especially designed tomeet the needs of nonscience stu-dents. Within each of the threeofferings, students are free to pur-sue their particular intereststhrough their choice of individualclasses. In addition to the information on the FSI provided in this bul-letin, detailed descriptions of eachyear's course offerings may befound on the MAP Web site. QUANTITATIVE REASONING Students in Quantitative Reasoning engage mathematicalconcepts in a variety of contexts inthe natural or social sciences. All courses include a substantialamount of problem solving thatrequires both conceptual and computational work. NATURAL SCIENCE I Scientific knowledge has its basis inour natural curiosity about theworld around us and our place in it.These courses approach the physicalsciences with the intent of askingand trying to answer interestingquestions, dealing with topics rang-ing from the origin of our universeand planet to how human activityaffects our environment. Studentsconsider the important roles playedby laws of physics and chemistry inbiology, earth and environmentalsciences, astrophysics, and cosmol-ogy, and develop an understandingof how the physical sciences informthe natural sciences generally.Mathematics is introduced in eachcourse with frequent applications tothe subject matter. Predictions thatcan be made only with the use ofmathematics are clearly delineated,showing the powerful role it playsin our understanding of the uni-verse. Wherever possible, thecourses relate science to societal problems and develop a historicalperspective. NATURAL SCIENCE II The complexity of the biologicalrealm continues to fascinate andchallenge modern scientists, who arecurrently engaged in such diversepursuits as exploring the organiza-tion and function of the brain,reconstructing the origin of thehuman species, linking the multi-plicity of interactions in ecosystems,and deciphering the influence ofheredity on complex traits. Thecourses in Natural Science II take anontraditional approach to the lifesciences, with an emphasis onapproaching science as a dynamicprocess of investigation and discov-ery. Each course selects a broadtheme that is at the forefront of con-temporary research, then uses spe-cific questions and examples tointroduce students to the methodol-ogy of scientific inquiry, the criticalevaluation of results, and the mathe-matical tools used to quantify scientific information.The advanced honors seminar program, launched in spring 2005, extends the principles of the freshman honors seminars to upper-level courses. Both sets ofcourses have as their goals to put undergraduates into contact with leading thinkers, to introduce them to important subjects, to challenge them intellectuallythrough demanding standards of analysis and oral and written argumentation, and toprepare them to conduct their own research. In some instances, students may count the advanced honors seminar toward their major or minor, if the department considers this appropriate; in other cases, theclasses count simply as electives. Sophomores and juniors typically have priority in reg-istering for advanced honors seminars. Below is a sampling of seminars from previoussemesters.Advanced Honors Seminars (28) SILVER CENTER, 100 WASHINGTON SQUARE EAST, ROOM 908, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6688. 212-998-8110. 27 ADVANCED HONORS SEMINARSCoursesUrban Collective Violence in AmericaV28.0105 W alkowitz. 4 points. Examines the urban origins, charac-ter, and changing patterns of vio-lence in American cities, focusingon collective violence rather thanindividual acts of violence, regard-less of how many victims an indi-vidual may have claimed. Considersthe extent to which American cul-ture and political institutionsencourage, sanctify, or militateagainst aggressive behavior and cre-ate a climate for or against violence.In that context, some concerns mustbe comparative, cross-cultural, andtransnational. In addition, the semi-nar addresses broad interdiscipli-nary conceptual questions thatanthropologists, psychologists, andsociologists, in particular, ask abouthuman nature, gender conditioningin Western cultures, and \"deviant\"subcultures. In creating a typologyfor the analysis of violence inAmerican cities over time, thecourse distinguishes between formsof violence, the direction of changessought, and the social and materialcharacteristics of the antagonists. Isthe conflict generated, for example,by a privileged elite seeking to pro- tect the authority that it feels isbeing jeopardized by aspiring new-comers, or is it rooted in efforts bythe gaina fair share? Vergil's Aeneid 4 points. on whatbooks constitute the Western\"canon,\" Vergil's Aeneid is one of those texts that, for better orworse, has influenced how wethink and act. The book is the epicstory of a hero, Aeneas, whoescapes from his homeland in Asia,Troy, after it has been sacked bythe Greeks. Aeneas wanders west-ward in search of a new home,arrives in Italy, and then wages awar with the native population toset in motion a divinely ordainedprocess that culminates, centuriesafter his death, in the founding ofRome. Apart from being a grip-ping story, the Aeneid can also be read as a foundation myth for theWest. It explores the tensionbetween public and private, andbetween duty and desire; it raisesquestions about the benefits\u2014andcosts\u2014of empire; and it explores increasingly timely questionsabout the effects war has onnations and individuals. The poemalso problematizes knowledge,raising very real questions abouthow (or even if) we know what wethink we know. This seminarinvolves close analysis of this book,in English translation and collat-eral readings from other ancienttexts, as well as a discussion ofrecent scholarly literature.Students participate in study tripsto several major museums anddevelop their own special projects. Cinema and Society in Europe Since 1945V28.0112 Judt. 4 points. Addresses aspects of European his-tory since World War II throughpostwar European cinema, dis-cussing the films themselves as artand entertainment, but also andabove all their subject matter, con-temporary setting, and impact (atthe time and since). Participantsmeet twice weekly: once to see thatweek's film, once for discussion. Inaddition to watching the films,students read assigned works of28 ADVANCED HONORS SEMINARShistory dealing with the period. Among the themes addressed arethe following: war and civil war asrepresented and remembered in thepostwar decades; the Cold War;decolonization; impact; the differentgenerations of both intoEurope postwar Europeanconsciousness. In a final paper, stu-dents choose one theme and then,with instructor's assistance, iden-tify a body of related films to seeand discuss. The History of Disbelief V28.0113 Stephens. 4 points. Discusses an extended history ofatheism and doubt (in the contextof a history of religion). Begins inGreece, then moves on to a briefdiscussion of anthropological per-spectives on belief, before returningto Greece, the Hebrews, and Rome,to India and Baghdad, and thenback to Europe during theRenaissance, the ScientificRevolution, the Enlightenment,and the Romantic period. Time isspent in England and America inthe 19th century, when disbeliefwas being tied to radical politics,before moving on to the connectionbetween disbelief and realism,modernism, and postmodernism.The main arguments for andagainst the existence of God areconsidered; however, the main pur-pose of this seminar is to force stu-dents to confront and grapple withsome of the most sophisticated andprofound human expressions of from the Diary to theInternetV28.0143 Augst. 4 points. Why do people write diaries, andhow should we read them? Whatkind of evidence do journals orblogs offer about the historical andsocial contexts from which theyemerge? What can they tell usabout the physical and virtualspaces in which people come torecognize themselves as individu-als, and about cultural meaningsand forms of individuality in gen-eral? This seminar explores themeaning and practice of diarywriting as it has evolved with tech-nologies of manuscript, print, anddigital computing. We seek to sit-uate contemporary Internet sites ofself-presentation, such as Facebook,MySpace, YouTube, and blogs, in ahistorical and literary perspective;consider how the diary has beenshaped by religious traditions ofself-examination, changing con-cepts of time, and the expansion ofliteracy; and define the diary's rela-tion to other literary genres, suchas the chronicle, autobiography,novel, and essay. Second, we seekto develop a set of concepts toguide us in the interpretation andpractice of self-representationacross various media. Reading bothcelebrated and obscure examples ofthe diary, and conducting groupresearch on contemporary digitalculture, students develop cross-cultural perspectives on self-creation and theexperiences of isolation, sincerity,narcissism, theatricality, privacy,and networking that inform them. Varieties of Religious Experience RevisitedV28.0144 Gilligan. 4 points. Utilizes but also updates WilliamJames's pioneering approach tointerpreting and understandingreligion in psychological ratherthan theological terms. Examineshow the term \"religion\" is moreconfusing than helpful when itfails to differentiate between awide variety of utterly incompati-ble beliefs and practices at differ-ent stages of cognitive andemotional development. Discussesthe phenomenon of \"political reli-gions\" (nationalism, totalitarian-ism, apocalyptic fundamentalism) as attempts to reject modernity(the modern scientific mentality),in order to fill the vacuum thatSartre called \"the God-shaped holein the soul of modern man\" thatresulted when the traditionalsources of moral, legal, and politi-cal authority (God, religion, purereason) lost their credibility assources of knowledge. Considersthat political religions result frompsychological regression and con-trasts them with the currentmoment in the evolution of reli-gious consciousness, in which thechallenge is to find progressiveforms of religious expression,understanding, and experienceconsistent with the modern scien-tific mentality, while not beingreducible to it. Concludes byexamining whether this is the con-text in which the next major stepin the evolution of both cultureand personality will need to occur. Hispanic Cities: New York V28.0151 D\u00e1vila. 4 points. What exactly is a city? Whatmakes a city \"Hispanic\"? How doesit become visible? What within the cosmopolitan inte-grate \"Hispanic Other\" into itsfabric? On what terms? How doesthe presence of the Hispanic popu-lation permanently change the faceof the city? This seminar traces theHispanic cultural presence in NewYork from the end of the 19th cen-tury to the present, includingresponses by artists and writers tothe terrorist attack of 9/11.Divided into modules, the courseexplores representation of andexchanges with the fromDiego Rivera to James de la Vega;and film from West Side Story to Raising Victor Vargas. Students par- ticipate in cultural activitiesaround New York and talk to sev-eral artists currently working here.Criticism includes authors such asGaston Bachelard, Michel deCerteau, and Walter Benjamin.Africana Studies at New York University is an interdisciplinary undertaking devoted to scholarship on the histories, political and cultural movements,institutions, economies, and identities of Africans and the African diaspora across the globe. Africa's own overlapping modernities and the transnational migrationsof its peoples\u2014whether forced or voluntary\u2014have complicated the meanings of\"black\" and \"African\" identities and experiences, prompting us to rethink the geo-graphical boundaries and conceptual paradigms surrounding the production of knowl-edge about Africa and its diasporic communities. NYU's location in one of the westernhemisphere's most cosmopolitan cities\u2014home to many of the broad constituencies weaim to study in relation to their other continental settings\u2014places us in a privilegedposition to lead and shape the development of Africana studies in the 21st century.Accordingly, the curriculum comprises interdisciplinary and cross-cultural teachingand research in the histories, cultures, economies, politics, and languages and culturalpractices of Africans in Africa, the Americas (North and South), the Caribbean, Europe,Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East. The program is administered from within theDepartment of Social and Cultural Analysis, and it maintains close relationships withcommunity programming and research activities by NYU's Institute of AfricanAmerican Affairs and Africa House. Africana Studies offers programs leading to B.A., B.A./M.A., and M.A. degrees, and a suite of joint M.A. programs with journalism (pending state approval),economics, and museum studies.MAJOR/MINOR IN Africana Studies (18) 41 EAST 11TH STREET, 7TH FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10003-4602. 212-998-9650. www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/africana DIRECTOR OF AFRICANA STUDIES: Associate Professor STUDIESFacultyProfessors: Dash, (Tisch) Associate Professors: (Tisch), Blake, Guerrero(Tisch)Assistant Professor: Ralph Clinical Associate Professor: Hinton Program MAJOR The Africana studies major com-prises introductory, elective, andresearch components, whichtogether make up a total of 11courses, as laid out below.Two introductory courses \u2014can be taken in any order: Concepts in Social and Cultural Analysis (V18.0001), an introduction to key terms andanalytical categories for interdis-ciplinary work in Africana studies and related fields One of the following: Approaches to Africana Studies(V18.0101), Introduction toPan-Africanism AFRICANA STUDIESSeven elective courses \u2014one course from each of four areas listedbelow, plus a fifth from any of thefour areas, in addition to twoupper-division electives as science: political sci-ence, psychology, and sociology Humanities: history, literature, music, philosophy, religion, andAfrican languages Arts: studio art or art history (theatre, performance studies,film, cinema studies, dance,music, photography, dramaticwriting, fine arts, and art history) Science: medicine, dentistry, psy- chology, and public health The last two electives should be two upper-division courses offeredby the Department of Social andCultural Analysis that addressissues pertinent to Africana studiesin relation to other allied fields.

The core and affiliated faculty members, drawn from many Faculty of Arts and Science and Tisch School of the Arts departments and programs,constitute one of NYU's strongest faculty groupings. The program interprets\"American\" in a broad sense to include assessments of the historical role of the UnitedStates in the Americas and, more generally, in world affairs. Inasmuch as the programhas a regional focus and a distinctive edge among other American studies programs,special attention is given to studies in urbanism and to New York in particular, a globalcity that comprises many world cultures.MINOR IN American Studies (18) 41 EAST 11TH STREET, 7TH FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10003-4602. 212-992-9650. www.nyu.edu/gsas/program/amerstu DIRECTOR OF AMERICAN STUDIES: Professor Zaloom of five courses,comprising Introduction toAmerican Studies (V18.0201), plusfour other courses listed by the pro-gram.

Byseeking to place the central event ofthe century in a history of diplo-macy and warfare that alsoincluded the War of 1812, theMexican-American War, illegalinvasions of Cuba and Nicaragua inthe 1850s, and the Spanish-American War, it attempts to illu-minate the imperial causes andconsequences of this domestic conflict. And by embedding theconflict over slavery in the UnitedStates into the histories of theHaitian Revolution, the LouisianaPurchase, Indian removal, theAtlantic cotton economy, and the hemispheric history of antislavery,it seeks to call into question thenationalist and regionalist framingof the event that has dominatedmost mainstream accounts.

Prerequisite: V18.0501 or any intro-ductory course in the social sciences orMAP course in World Cultures.The chief intent of this minor is to allow students to do significant and struc- tured interdisciplinary work in ancient studies and to acquire an understandingof several ancient civilizations and the ways in which they are examined and analyzed. The adviser for the minor is responsible for ensuring that each student's pro-gram of study remains coherent and logical, although there is considerable flexibilitywithin the bounds of the requirements. Courses may be selected that deal with differentperiods and methodological approaches, as well as a variety of geographical areas thatthe requirements demand. Each student's course of study is designed on an individualbasis, in accordance with his or her needs and interests. A number of CAS departments and programs, as well as institutes and centers, are directly involved in this program: Anthropology, Art History, Classics, ComparativeLiterature, East Asian Studies, English, Hebrew and Judaic Studies, History, IrishStudies, Linguistics, Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies, and the Alexander S. OnassisProgram in Hellenic Studies. The minor consists of five 4-point courses, which are nor-mally selected from the appropriate offerings of these departments and programs. Allfive of the courses selected must be offered by departments other than the student'smajor department, and no more than two may be taken in any one department. Students are furthermore expected to examine at least three different civiliza- tions or cultures in completing this minor. Language courses may not be used to fulfillthe requirements of this minor. It is also required that students who choose this minorcomplete, as a capstone experience, an independent study course, which is normally thefifth course taken for the minor. The adviser for the ancient studies minor may assiststudents in designing a project and in finding an appropriate faculty member to directthis independent study.PROGRAM IN Ancient Studies 25 WAVERLY PLACE, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6790. 212-998-8592. www.ancientstudies.as.nyu.edu ADVISER: Clinical Associate Professor Roth (Art History/Hebrew and Judaic Studies) 38 ANCIENT STUDIESThe Department of Anthropology is one of the country's leading graduate and undergraduate centers for cultural anthropology, archaeology, linguistic anthro-pology, and biological anthropology\u2014the four principal subfields of anthropol- ogy studied in the undergraduate curriculum. The department considers its greatestassets to be the various individual areas of faculty expertise: archaeological specialtiessuch as European, Near Eastern, and South Asian prehistory; biological anthropologyareas such as molecular primatology, primate behavior and ecology, and paleoanthropol-ogy; linguistic anthropology foci such as discourse analysis and language socialization;and cultural anthropology specialties such as the ethnography of North America,Africa, India, China, the Near and Middle East, the Caribbean, Latin America, Europe,Australia, and the South Pacific. Major theoretical emphasis is on the systems ofthought and symbolic representation of the self and society; the relation between femaleand male domains of interaction; changing patterns of social organization and hierarchywithin small-scale societies, urban settings, and bureaucratic institutions; medicalanthropology; science studies; race and ethnicity; and the problem of ethnographic rep-resentation in film and other media. Departmental resources include an extensive film and video collection, as well as teaching and research labs for archaeology, linguistic anthropology, and biologicalanthropology, which can be used for research by advanced undergraduates. A regularcolloquium series and an undergraduate student association welcome undergraduateparticipation. Formal and informal cooperative arrangements with museums, zoos, andother academic programs in the greater New York area place at students' disposal agroup of anthropological scholars, materials, and resources unparalleled in this country.DEPARTMENT OF Anthropology (14) 25 WAVERLY PLACE, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6790. 212-998-8550. www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/anthro CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Myers DIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES: Associate Professor Di Fiore 39 ANTHROPOLOGYFacultyProfessor Emeritus: Lynch David B. Kriser Professor of the Humanities; Professor ofMiddle Eastern and IslamicStudies and Anthropology:Ginsburg Sutton, Weatherford40 ANTHROPOLOGYProgram FIELDS OF INQUIRY Cultural anthropology is the study of social organization and the sys-tems of thought and values thatboth reflect and inform social prac-tice in different cultures. Culturalanthropology is interdisciplinaryin orientation, analyzing and syn-thesizing religious, artistic, eco-nomic, and political practicesthrough the common medium applies its insights andmethods to complex, urban, andindustrialized societies. An empha-sis of the department is the ethno-graphic study of cultural, social,and political processes that shapeour lives and those of other people,especially as we are drawn togetherand influence one another inincreasingly transnational andglobal interactions. The department participates in the University's Hagop KevorkianCenter for Near Eastern Studies,the Center for Latin American andCaribbean Studies, the Institute ofFrench Studies, the Program inMuseum Studies, the Program inCulture and Media, and the Centerfor Media, Culture, and History.Linguistic anthropology focuses onhow language is interpreted andused in cultural contexts. Lan-guage use is socially organized; itis a key to understanding the waysin which speakers create andchange social realities. Studiedwithin historical as well as culturalframeworks and in relation toother social institutions (such aspolitics, education, law, medicine),variation in ways of speaking lan-guage(s) adds to our understandingof how social categories such asethnicity, race, and gender areinteractionally constituted acrosscontexts, cultures, and societies. Anthropological archaeology is the use of artifacts and other mate-rial remains to understand humanculture. It attempts to breathe lifeinto a material record that at firstglance appears static and fragmen-tary. The research interests ofanthropological archaeologistsrange from the earliest production of durable tools 2.5 million yearsago to the refuse currently beinggenerated by modern cities. Allaspects of past human existence,including art, technology, religion,gender, economic and social organ-ization, and food-getting strate-gies, are addressed by researchersin anthropological archaeology. Biological anthropology encompasses the study of primatebiological diversity and includesthe anatomy, genetics, behavior,ecology, and evolution of humansand other primates. It is linked tothe other subfields of anthropologyby its commitment to the study ofhuman biology and evolutionwithin the context of culture, soci-ety, and ecology. Close ties withthe American Museum of NaturalHistory, the New York UniversitySchool of Medicine, and theWildlife Conservation SocietyInternational Programs at theBronx Zoo facilitate the depart-ment's diverse research interests inbiological anthropology. DEPARTMENTAL OBJECTIVES Anthropology courses contribute to undergraduate education in twoways. First, the scope of the disci-pline's interests effectively bridgesthe humanities, the social sciences,and the natural sciences. Anthro-pology asks basic questions concerning the origins and devel-opment of humans and their cul-tures and divergent systems ofthought, belief, and social order.By systematically analyzing vari-ous cultural traditions\u2014contem-porary as well as historicallyknown\u2014anthropology raises criti-cal questions concerning the basesof both world civilizations. Anunderstanding of the distinct wayanthropology formulates andattempts to answer its basic ques-tions is a necessary component of acomprehensive liberal education. Second, the department offers concentrated programs of study forthe minor, major, or honors stu-dent. A minor usually emphasizesone of the four subdisciplines. Forthe major, the department encour-ages study in all of the subdisci-plines, because each supplementsand complements the others inpresenting humans as both biolog- ical and social beings. An honorsprogram includes in-depthresearch and writing in one aspectof biological, archaeological, lin-guistic, or cultural anthropology. The director of undergraduate studies works closely with studentsin designing minor and major pro-grams of study that integrate thegoals of individual students withthe offerings and intellectual goalsof the department and complemen-tary disciplines. The department prides itself on its graduate and undergraduateprograms' integrated nature, whichenables minors, majors, and honorsstudents to participate in a varietyof challenging graduate coursesand seminars. Also, the activeAnthropology UndergraduateStudent Association (AUSA) con-nects students to one anotherthrough events and an e-mailforum (listserv). MAJORS The major consists of 36 points,which include Human Society and Culture (V14.0001), HumanEvolution (V14.0002), and Cultures(V14.0003), offered onlyduring the spring semester). Theother courses may be selected fromany subfield of anthropology.Internships approved by the direc-tor of undergraduate studies, how-ever, may not be applied towardthe major, and a grade of at least C is required in every course to becounted toward the major. Anycourse with a grade of C- or lowerwill not count toward the major.Majors should consult regularlywith the director of undergraduatestudies in order to take full advan-tage of the seminars and researchopportunities open to them. Joint major with the Department of Classics: This is an interdepartmental majorincluding courses from theDepartment of Anthropology andthe Department of Classics.

Twenty (20) points are required in classics. See Classics (27) for additional information. A grade of at least C is required inevery course to be counted towardthe joint major. Joint major with the Department of Linguistics: The joint major in anthropology andlinguistics emphasizes the comple-mentarity of anthropological andsociolinguistic approaches to lan-guage. Students are required totake 20 points (five courses) eachfrom the Department of Anthro-pology and the Department ofLinguistics. A grade of at least C isrequired in every course to becounted toward a joint major.Required courses in anthropology:Human Society and Culture(V14.0001), Anthropology ofLanguage (V14.0017), Symbolism,Meaning, and Social Life (V14.0048),and two other cultural or linguisticanthropology courses approved bythe Department of Anthropology'sdirector of undergraduate studies.Required courses in linguistics: V55.0660 or V61.0015, plus atleast three additional courses cho-sen in consultation with the direc-tor of undergraduate studies inlinguistics. See Linguistics (61) for additional information. MINOR The minor consists of any fourcourses in the department. The\"principles\" courses (V14.0001,V14.0002, and V14.0003) are rec-ommended as overviews of the dis-cipline and as prerequisites formore advanced courses. Minorsconsult with the director of under-graduate studies to design a pro-gram that best accommodates theirinterests. A grade of C- or lowerwill not count toward the minor. HONORS PROGRAM A degree in anthropology isawarded with honors to selectedmajors who apply for admission tothe program through the directorof undergraduate studies during their sophomore or junior year.Honors program candidates areexpected to maintain an overallGPA of 3.65 with an average of3.65 in the major. Candidates forthe honors program complete 10courses for a total of 40 points ofanthropology course work. Twohonors tracks are available. Thefirst, typically followed by stu-dents concentrating in sociocultu-ral or linguistic anthropology,consists of two senior honors semi-nars with substantial research andwriting components. The secondtrack, typically followed by thoseconcentrating in biological orarchaeological anthropology,includes two research courses,V14.0950 and V14.0951, inwhich a research is carriedout, and a Special Seminar inAnthropology (V14.0800 orV14.0801) or a graduate course.All of these courses count towardthe major.

GRADUATE COURSES OPEN TO UNDERGRADUATES Qualified anthropology majors may take graduate courses with thepermission of the director ofundergraduate studies in consulta-tion with the instructor. Consultthe current Graduate School of Arts and Science Bulletin.The Department of Art History offers courses in the history and criticism of the visual arts in major world cultures.In the Art and Architectural History program, students at the introductory level examine works of art and learn the critical and historical bases for understandingand appreciating them. At the advanced level, majors and nonmajors investigate style,iconography, patronage, social and political contexts, and other aspects of the arts inmore specific geographical areas and periods. This advanced work and foreign lan-guage study provide a solid foundation for those who plan to attend graduate school toprepare for careers in areas such as scholarship, teaching, museums, and writing. The Urban Design and Architecture Studies program offers an interdiscipli- nary analytic approach to these subjects. The program provides a broad humanistic per-spective on cities' physical aspects, as well as preprofessional training for futurearchitects, city planners, public administrators, and writers on urban problems. An internationally renowned faculty and a diverse group of students use the Grey Art Library and Study Center, which includes lecture and seminar rooms, offices,a reference library, computers, and ample space for the study of visual materials.DEPARTMENT OF Art History (43) SILVER CENTER, 100 WASHINGTON SQUARE EAST, ROOM 303, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6688. 212-998-8180. www.arthistory.as.nyu.edu CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Associate Professor Karmel DIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES: Professor Krinsky DIRECTOR OF URBAN DESIGNAND ARCHITECTURE STUDIESPROGRAM: Clinical Associate Professor Broderick 48 ART HISTORYFacultyProfessors Emeriti: Hyman, Landau, Walton Helen Gould Sheppard Professor Emerita of ArtHistory:Sandler Paulette (jointappointment with Hebrew andJudaic Studies) Clinical Associate Professor: Broderick Associate Arts Professor: S.

One of six programs inthe Department of Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA), it provides an interdis- ciplinary approach to understanding the history and contemporary experiences ofAsian/Pacific Americans in the Americas. The category of Asian/Pacific Americanincludes people of East Asia, South Asia, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and the PacificIslands living in the United States, as well as in other parts of the Americas. The curriculum takes a critical community formations approach, which uses field research as the central methodology, to examine the relationship between theoryand practice and between structure and agency in the study of Asian/Pacific Americancommunities. Students develop important analytical skills that will help them to nego-tiate today's geopolitics, as well as to gain a level of cross-cultural awareness and skillthat will be useful to them in any field of study they choose to enter. The two main areas of concentration are urban studies and diaspora studies. Urban studies examines the formation of Asian/Pacific American communities in rela-tion to the various cultural, social, and political institutions in urban settings, with spe-cial emphasis on the New York metropolitan area. Diaspora studies investigates theprocesses that enable Asian/Pacific American communities in the United States andAmericas to sustain ties with communities throughout the world. Central is the analy-sis of cultural production\u2014social, political, and economical processes\u2014as well as cross-cultural conflict and collaboration. In coordination with A/P/A Studies, the A/P/A Institute engages important artists, scholars, writers, and activists to campus. This provides the opportunity for dis-cussion, performance, and reflection with students, faculty, and community members.MAJOR/MINOR IN Asian/Pacific/American Studies (18) 41-51 EAST 11TH STREET, 7TH FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10003-4602. 212-992-9650. www.apa.as.nyu.edu DIRECTOR OF comprises introductory,elective, and research components,which together make up a total of11 courses, as outlined below.

The majorin biology is an integrated yetdiverse program that builds a solidfoundation in the basic elements ofmolecular and cellular biology,genetics, evolution, organ systems,and population studies. Studentsare exposed to modern concepts,state-of-the-art approaches, and cur-rent methods of experimentation inmolecular biology, biochemistry,genomics, and bioinformaticsthrough introductory courses takenat the very outset of their studies.Intermediate courses then providein-depth exploration of the majorareas of biology, including molecu-lar genetics, field biology, andgenomics and bioinformatics.Advanced students may register forgraduate-level courses, which aremost often given in the specializedareas of faculty research. The department also offers a series of discrete minors in the lifesciences, specifically in the areas ofmolecular and cell biology, genet-ics, genomics and bioinformatics,and environmental biology. Eachminor is designed to hone skills ina particular contemporary area ofbiology and requires a laboratoryexperience. The minors permit stu-dents to create a course of studythat will meet their unique aca-demic and career goals. This program provides out- standing preparation for careers inresearch, academia, medicine, den-tistry, and related fields. Graduatesof the department have a remark-able record of success in acceptanceinto professional schools and inestablishing notable careers in thebiomedical sciences. Other courses offered by the department are designed toacquaint nonscience majors withcontemporary issues in biology.Such courses are often topical,addressing problems such as envi-ronmental pollution, limits of theearth, and human physiology. Outstanding and highly moti- vated students are offered specialopportunities for honors work,independent study, summer labo-ratory research, internships, andother enhancements. Upper-levelstudents may become involved in research projects in faculty labora-tories through the many formaland informal opportunitiesafforded by the department. Thedepartment has a tradition ofimportant research accomplish-ment and contains several special-ized research and laboratoryfacilities that are integrated intothe educational programs. Theseinclude the undergraduateMolecular Biology Laboratory, theScanning and TransmissionElectron Microscope Facility, andthe Tissue Culture Facility.

Abroad liberal arts education\u2014which includes a general education component (the Morse Academic Plan) and a major in a liberal arts discipline or interdis-ciplinary field\u2014provides a sound foundation for many careers in business. The skills and perspectives of the liberal arts\u2014in areas such as analysis and communica-tion\u2014are practical as well as personally enriching. Liberal arts students, however, canconsiderably enhance their preparedness for business by also completing a small num-ber of more specific courses. In consultation with the Undergraduate College of theLeonard N. Stern School of Business, the College of Arts and Science (CAS) has identi-fied a set of such courses. These courses\u2014some offered by CAS and some by Stern\u2014areincorporated in the minor in business studies. By completing this CAS minor, studentsacquire core knowledge and quantitative skills that are invaluable assets for success inthe business professions. Intended especially for students interested in the humanities, the minor in busi- ness studies is administered by the college office. Students considering the minor shouldconsult with the business studies adviser in the College Preprofessional Advising Officeat Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 901; 212-998-8160. This person'sresponsibilities include advising prospective and declared minors, evaluating the appli-cability of transfer credit, approving course substitutions when warranted, and meetingwith Stern on matters of CAS/Stern articulation. At least 50 percent of CAS credits and50 percent of Stern credits must be taken in residency at NYU.MINOR IN Business Studies SILVER CENTER, 100 WASHINGTON SQUARE EAST, ROOM 901, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6688. 212-998-8160. www.nyu.edu/cas/business.studies 73 BUSINESS STUDIESProgramsThe minor consists of six courses, as indicated below.

Professor John W . Draper, the first president of the soci- ety and chair of the department, was an early pioneer in photography, working withSamuel F. B. Morse. The department has undertaken a major development plan, strengthening its faculty, instructional laboratories, course offerings, and research facilities in the areas ofphysical, biophysical, bioorganic, and theoretical chemistry. Research areas representedby faculty members span the traditional areas of organic, physical, inorganic, and theo-retical chemistry with research programs in chemical biology, biomolecular chemistry,computational theoretical chemistry, nanoscience, and the materials sciences. Qualifiedundergraduates are encouraged to participate in research as early as their sophomoreyear of study. The department houses state-of-the-art laboratory facilities for its under-graduate chemistry courses. Majoring in chemistry at the College of Arts and Science provides strong prepa- ration for graduate study in chemistry; professional education in medicine, dentistry, orpatent law; and careers in industrial or pharmaceutical chemistry and biotechnology.DEPARTMENT OF Chemistry (25) SILVER CENTER, 100 WASHINGTON SQUARE EAST, ROOM 1001, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6688. 212-998-8400. www.chemistry.as.nyu.edu CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Geacintov DIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES: Clinical Associate Professor Goldberg ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES: Associate Professor Brenner 75 CHEMISTRYFacultyProfessors Emeriti: Lewin, Moskowitz, Fishman Clinical Associate Professors: Callahan, Goldberg, Halpin Program DEPARTMENTAL OBJECTIVES Chemistry is the central natural science interfacing physics andmathematics with the life sciences.Knowledge of chemistry has alwaysbeen fundamental to the investiga-tion of the physical world, as wellas to an in-depth understanding of living systems. The range of mod-ern chemistry spans chemicalphysics, materials science, andmolecular biology, merging the tra-ditional divisions of analytical,organic, inorganic, and physicalchemistry. In its recent develop-ment, the department is focusing its interest on physical, biophysical,and bioorganic chemistry, exploit-ing interdisciplinary areas of theory, materials science, and bio-logical chemistry. The departmenthas a large and active theoreticalgroup in the areas of chemical76 CHEMISTRYphysics and biomolecular model- ing. Active research areas in thedepartment include cancer research,nanotechnology, spectroscopy,materials science, and chemicalbiology. Graduates of the depart-ment have found rewarding careersand achieved distinction in allphases of scientific life, from basicresearch to commercial productdevelopment. The late GertrudeElion, a 1941 M.S. in chemistryfrom New York University, sharedthe 1988 Nobel Prize in Medicineor Physiology for her research inpharmaceutical chemistry. The department offers the major in chemistry and in bio-chemistry. A selection of electiveadvanced courses, undergraduateand graduate, can be combined toprovide a broad, varied program ofstudy in chemistry. The depart-ment also offers a number ofcourses for nonscience students andservice courses for students in theother schools. The programs ofstudy in chemistry prepare stu-dents for graduate work toward themaster's degree or the doctorate forcareers in research, development,and teaching and/or for furtherstudy in areas such as medicine,dentistry, basic medical sciences,and allied health fields includingforensic science. In addition, bothmajors leave students well pre-pared to pursue patent law or, witha minor in economics, to enter thefield of technology investment aswell as management in the chemi-cal industry. The department offers special honors courses that satisfy the firsttwo years of chemistry required formajors and for the prehealth cur-riculum in medicine, dentistry,and basic medical sciences.Students need permission from thedepartment to register for thesecourses, which are limited to smallclasses. Permission is based on sev-eral factors, including backgroundin both mathematics and physics;performance in high school chem-istry courses; and, if offered, aplacement examination. Studentsmay be eligible to enter the second-year honors course (organic) basedon exceptional performance in theregular General Chemistry course.A special Honors Organic II lab isavailable for a select few studentsfrom the Organic Chemistry lec-ture course.MAJORS Students thinking of majoring inchemistry or biochemistry arestrongly urged to seek courseadvisement from the Departmentof Chemistry as early in their academic careers as possible.Chemistry is a sequential subjectwith courses building on earliercourses. Delay in taking certainkey prerequisite courses can makeit impossible to complete a majorin four years without summerattendance. A grade of C or better in chem- istry and the other mandatedcourses is required for the fulfill-ment of the chemistry or biochem-istry major in the department.Students who do not have an aver-age of 2.0 in departmentallyrequired courses by the time theyhave completed 64 points in allcourses may be asked to changetheir major. The major in chemistry builds on a core of required courses inchemistry, physics, and mathemat-ics. The required of calculus and twosemesters of general physics arerequired. A third semester of cal-culus or a course in linear algebrais strongly recommended as prepa-ration for V25.0651. For studentsinterested in pursuing chemistryon the graduate level or with aninterest in theoretical chemistry,the additional courses in mathe-matics are highly recommended.These include Calculus III(V63.0123) and Linear Algebra(V63.0140). One year of be substituted forcalculus V63.0121 and V63.0122,plus V63.0123. The core, described above, pro- vides a basic background in chem-istry. Students normally areencouraged to complete the coursesin general chemistry, organic chem-istry, physics, and calculus prior toentry into physical chemistry in the third year. Alternative programsare also possible. It is stronglyadvised, however, that an advanced-level chemistry course be taken inthe third year of study, allowing atleast three more semesters to com-plete all major requirements. Undergraduate specialization in organic, biochemical, physical, ortheoretical chemistry may beaccomplished through combina-tions of advanced elective under-graduate and graduate coursesopen to undergraduates. Thesecourses should be chosen in consul-tation with the Department ofChemistry. For students interested in preparation for careers in thechemical industry or business stud-ies, there are several alternativesavailable. The major in chemistrywith a minor in economics givesthe student training in chemistrywith a business background. Students interested in careers in medicine, dentistry, or basic medicalsciences may wish to consider themajor in biochemistry. Additionalcourses in biology may be desirablefor such students. The appropriatepreprofessional adviser should beconsulted for details. The Department of Chemistry offers the following majors: Major in chemistry: The mini- mum requirements, in addition tothe core courses cited above, arecompletion of ExperimentalMethods (V25.0661) and twoadvanced elective courses. Major in biochemistry: The minimum requirements, in addi-tion to the core courses citedabove, are Biochemistry I and II(G25.1881,1882), ExperimentalBiochemistry (G25.1885), andBiophysical Chemistry (G25.1814).Students in this major are remindedthat these courses must be taken inthe proper order. Careful courseplanning is required to ensure thatthis can be done within a normalfour-year program. In addition to these majors, the department offers several programsand options that may be of interestto students: American Chemical Society certification: Students majoring in either chemistry or biochem-istry may be certified by the77 CHEMISTRYAmerican Chemical Society on graduation. Interested studentsshould consult with the director ofundergraduate studies regardingthe additional course requirementsfor this certification. Program in Chemistry and Engineering: The College of Arts and Science offers a joint B.S./B.E.program with Stevens Institute ofTechnology. For students inter-ested in chemistry, the programleads to the B.S. degree from NewYork University and the B.E. inbiomedical, chemical, or environ-mental engineering from Stevens.Further information is availablefrom Joseph Hemmes in Advising Center, SilverCenter, 100 Room 905; 212-998-8130. Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree: Students who complete the required core courses plus Experi-mental Methods (V25.0661); threeadvanced electives in chemistry;The Contemporary Chemist(V25.0942); Advanced Individual Study(V25.0997,0998) or Senior Honorsin Chemistry (V25.0995,0996);and one course in computer scienceapproved by the Department ofChemistry may elect to graduatewith the degree of Bachelor ofScience (B.S.) instead of theBachelor of Arts (B.A.). Studentsshould note that the B.S. programis very difficult to complete withina normal four-year academic pro-gram and that it confers no particu-lar advantage to students inpremedical or predental programs. MINOR Completion of any four 4-pointcourses numbered V25.0101 orhigher constitutes a minor inchemistry. Only three of the fourcourses may also be used to satisfyanother department's major. Nograde lower than C will count, andan average of 2.0 or better in allchemistry courses is required.GENERAL INFORMATION Laboratory courses in chemistry:Due to the potential hazard of anychemical experimentation, safetygoggles must be worn at all timesin the laboratories. Laboratoryequipment, which is lent to thestudent for the duration of thecourse, must be replaced by thestudent if it is damaged or broken.Purchase cards must be acquiredfor this purpose and cost $25.Purchase cards may be obtainedfrom the stockroom during the firstweek of the term. Unused portionsof the deposit are redeemable. Students who do not return borrowed laboratory equipment atthe end of a course are charged anadditional fee, and their grademay be recorded as incompleteand not released until \"checkout\"is completed. Advanced standing: Students who have taken college-levelcourses in secondary schools andwho have achieved a grade of 4 or5 on the College EntranceExamination Board AdvancedPlacement Test will be grantedadvanced placement. For details,see the section on the AdvancedPlacement Program in theAdmission section of this bulletin. However, unless prior laboratorywork is extensive, GeneralChemistry II Laboratory(V25.0104) or, in exceptionalcases, the Freshman HonorsLaboratory (V25.0112) must betaken before taking advancedchemistry courses such as OrganicChemistry I (V25.0243) and itslaboratory. Advice about theappropriate course should beobtained from the director ofundergraduate studies in thedepartment. Research: The department endeavors to make research oppor-tunities available during the sum-mer and the academic year towell-qualified students at all lev-els. In order to participate inresearch in the department, stu-dents must both meet the prereq-uisites and register for the researchcourses Advanced Individual Studyand Research (V25.0997,0998) or, if eligible, Senior Honors inChemistry (V25.0995,0996). Ineither case, permission of the direc-tor of undergraduate studies isrequired before registering in thesecourses. HONORS PROGRAM The honors program in chemistry iscomposed of several elements, start-ing with the Honors GeneralChemistry course (V25.0109) andculminating with two semesters ofSenior Honors Research(V25.0995,0996). Students maygraduate with honors without hav-ing Honors General or HonorsOrganic Chemistry courses.However, by the time the student isin the sophomore year, he or she isencouraged to engage in experimen-tal or theoretical research.Depending on the number of cred-its the student is registered for, theinitial exposure to research may ormay not be for credit. But theremust be, at minimum, one semesterof registered research IndependentStudy (V25.0997,0998) beforeentering the senior year and seniorhonors research. Please contactProfessor Henry Brenner, director ofthe Senior Honors Research course,for more detailed information.Candidates for a degree with honorsin chemistry must have an overallGPA of 3.65 and a GPA of 3.65 inrequired courses for the chemistryor biochemistry degree. They musttake two semesters of Senior Honorsin Chemistry (V25.0995,0996). Asenior thesis based on this workmust be prepared, approved by theadviser, and presented at a specialseminar in the spring term of thesenior year. Students desiring entryinto the honors program mustobtain the approval of the directorof undergraduate studies prior tothe end of their junior year. Forgeneral requirements, please see thesection Honors and Awards in this bulletin.78 CHEMISTRYCoursesThe following courses are lectures unless otherwise indicated.

At least three must be from withinthe CAMS program; two can befrom departments in the College ofArts and Science and/or theSteinhardt School of Culture, Education, and HumanDevelopment. Courses taken forthe CAMS minor cannot beapplied to another major or minorwithout prior approval from all the relevant directors of undergraduatestudies. Courses CAMS COURSES The CAMS program was initiatedin fall of 2006 with the goal ofproviding students instruction inchild and adolescent mental healthfrom practicing psychiatrists andpsychologists at an internationallyrenowned clinical and research cen-ter. Some courses have prerequi-sites, as specified below. Child andAdolescent Psychopathology(V05.0101, see description below)is the core course upon which stu-dents will complete the require-ments for the minor. The programcurrently offers 10 courses, alongwith numerous options for inde-pendent study. A number of courses are now in development ontopics such as divorce, eating dis-orders, parenting, family therapy,positive psychology, and drug use.Many of the CAMS courses areavailable to all undergraduateswithout prerequisite. Child and Adolescent PsychopathologyV05.0101 Prerequisite: V89.0001. Shatkin, Evans. Offered in the fall. psychopathology courses arecommonplace among undergradu-ate psychology curricula, coursesfocusing on child and adolescent psychopathology are relatively rare.Through lecture anddiscussions, this course focuses etiology, epidemiology,phenomenology, nosology, anddiagnosis. It students in acritical of common childand adolescent psychopathologyand challenges social and culturalassumptions of what constitutes\"normal\" versus \"pathological\"behavior, cognition, and emotion.Students also complete onepracticum by participating with aclinician (psychologist or psychia-trist) during the evaluation of a83 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH STUDIESchild or adolescent patient at the NYU Child Study Center. The Treatment of Child and Adolescent Mental IllnessV05.0102 Prerequisite: V05.0101. Shatkin, Evans. Offered in the spring.4 points.Provides students with an overviewand understanding of the currentmethods employed in the treat-ment of child and adolescent men-tal illness. For most of the pastcentury, treatments for childrenand adolescents suffering frommental illness relied primarily onopen-ended psychotherapies,which have not consistentlydemonstrated a beneficial effect.Over the past 25 years, however, avariety of new evidence-basedtreatments have emerged, includ-ing behavioral psychotherapiessuch as cognitive behavior therapyfor anxiety and depression, dialec-tical behavior therapy for personal-ity disorders, and parentmanagement training for childrenwith oppositional and defiant dis-orders. In addition, we now havestrong evidence supporting the useof various pharmacological inter-ventions for attention-deficithyperactivity disorder (ADHD),mood and anxiety disorders, andautism. Students investigate eachof these treatments by reading andanalyzing much of the originalresearch that established their effi-cacy. This course builds uponChild and AdolescentPsychopathology (V05.0101). The Science of Happiness V05.0110 Schlecter, W asser. Offered in the spring. 4 points.Examines the state of college-stu-dent mental health and wellness ona personal and systems level. Asundergraduate university studentsapproach the end of adolescence,they often reevaluate the beliefs,values, and assumptions withwhich they left home. Youngadulthood is a time of great prom-ise, but the transition from childto adult is never easy. We look athow individuals can create positivechange by reinterpreting theirgoals and identifying steps towarda successful college experience.Key findings from the fields ofneuroscience and positive psychol- ogy are referenced to inform ourstudy of the biopsychosocial under-pinnings of success and happiness.Through lectures and discussions,students learn about a variety ofwellness topics that include mind-fulness, relationships, and self-esteem. The final project requiresstudents to promote an area ofmental wellness on campus. Skepticism and Proof: Research Methods in Child Mental HealthV05.0120 Lucas, Gallagher. Offered in the fall. 4 points.Clinical practice and public policyin child mental health is too oftendriven by the media, conventionalwisdom, and prejudice rather thanby scientific data. Evidence-basedclinical care seeks to guide practi-tioners in the critical appraisal ofdata on risk factors, prevention,and treatment. This course isdesigned for those who wish toread the health research literatureand draw their own conclusions. Itprovides a practical means to learnand apply research methods andfocuses on the knowledge andskills needed to design, carry out,and evaluate a research study.Discussion of topical \"hot-button\"issues, such as the apparent \"epi-demic\" of certain diagnoses, theinfluence of the environment orculture on child mental health, andthe risks/benefits of widely pre-scribed medications, are combinedwith a systematic review of theexisting evidence base on currentempirically supported treatmentfor child mental health problems. Behavioral Interventions for Children with DisruptiveBehavior Disorders: PracticumV05.0131,0132 Fleiss, Abikoff. (ADHD) is the most com-monly diagnosed neurobehavioralchildhood disorder, affectingbetween 5 and 7 percent of thepopulation. It is a complex disor-der that typically impacts a child'sfunctioning across multiple set-tings. Although medication isoften the first-line treatment, amultimodal approach, includingbehavioral interventions, is often necessary to address deficits insocial skills, classroom behavior,and parent-child relations. Thistwo-part summer course beginswith a didactic that helps studentsobtain a broader understanding ofthe impact of this disorder on chil-dren's functioning and learn specif-ically how behavioral treatmentsare employed to improve children'sfunctioning in social, academic,and home settings. It provides afoundation in social learning the-ory and then, through a practicumat the NYU Child Study Center'sSummer Program for Kids, offerssupervised, hands-on experience inapplying behavioral principles andprocedures. Ongoing discussionwith supervisors regarding theclinical expression of symptomsand treatment response takes placedaily.

The course sur-veys this vital period with a mod-ern research interpretation. History of the Roman Empire V27.0278 Identical to V57.0206. Offered every other year. 4 points.In the spring of 44 B.C., JuliusCaesar was murdered by a group ofsenators disgruntled with hismonarchic ways. However, Caesar'sadoptive son and heir, Octavian,was quickly on the scene and inlittle more than a decade managedto establish himself as Rome's firstemperor. About three centurieslater, Constantine the Great wouldrise to imperial power and withhim came a new state religion\u2014Christianity. This course examinesthe social and political history ofthe Roman Empire from the timeof Augustus to that of Constantineand also closely observes the paral-lel growth of Christianity. History of Ancient Law V27.0292 Offered periodically. 4 points.Examines the development of lawand legal systems and the relation-ships of these to the societies thatcreated them, starting with someancient Near Eastern systems andworking down to the Roman period. The main focus is on thefully developed system of Romanlaw. ART AND ARCHAEOLOGY Archaic and Classical Art:Greek and EtruscanV27.0312 Identical to V43.0102. 4 points.See description under Art History (43). Hellenistic and Roman Art V27.0313 Identical to V43.0103. 4 points.See description under Art History (43).

PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION Ancient Religion: From Paganism to ChristianityV27.0409 Identical to V90.0409. Offered periodically. 4 points.The period from the beginnings ofGreek religion until the spread ofChristianity spans over 2,000years and many approaches to reli-gious and moral issues. This course traces developments such asOlympian gods of Homer andHesiod; hero worship; public andprivate and Stoicism. Itdeals with changes in Greek reli-gion during the Roman republicand early empire and the success ofChristians in converting pagans inspite of official persecution. Greek Thinkers V27.0700 Identical to V83.0122. Offered periodically. 4 points.The origins of nonmythical specu-lation among the Greeks and themain patterns of philosophicalthought, from Thales and otherearly speculators about the physical 93 CLASSICSnature of the world through Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, theStoics, the Epicureans, and theNeoplatonists. SPECIAL COURSES Special Topics in ClassicalStudies I, IIV27.0293,0294 Prerequisite: per- mission of the instructor. Usuallyassigns readings in English transla-tion. Offered periodically. 2 or 4 points.Seminar topics vary from semesterto semester, although the focus isalways on a limited aspect of life,history, literature, art, or archaeol-ogy of Greco-Roman antiquity.Topics from past semesters includethe Trojan War, archaeology andpottery, Alexander the Great, theEtruscans, and crime and violence in the ancient world. Future topicsmay include Plato and Aristotle,ancient medicine, the Age ofPericles, the Age of Augustus, andLatin love poetry. Internship V27.0980,0981 Prerequisite: per- mission of the department. Open only tojuniors and seniors. Offered every year.2 or 4 points per term.Internships with institutions suchas the Brooklyn Museum and theAmerican Numismatic Societyafford students the opportunity towork outside the University inareas related to the field of classics.Requirements for completion ofsuch internships include periodicprogress reports and a paperdescribing the entire project.Independent Study V27.0997,0998 Prerequisite: per- mission of the department. 2 or 4 pointsper term. GRADUATE COURSES OPEN TO UNDERGRADUATES Courses in classics offered in the Graduate School of Arts andScience are open to all undergradu-ates who have reached the requiredadvanced level of Greek or Latinlanguage instruction.Collegiate Seminars offer select freshmen the opportunity to be in a small, intel- lectually stimulating class taught by a distinguished faculty member. Theseseminars aim to introduce students to demanding and challenging standards of analysis and argumentation, oral as well as written, by means of intensive discussion,papers on focused topics, and readings that emphasize critical interpretation rather thanabsorption of information. An additional feature of this program is that it gives students the benefit of mentoring by the Collegiate Professor, not only during the semester of the course butthroughout their entire undergraduate careers, and of working with fellow students andthe faculty member to create special enrichment and reunion activities. Except wherenoted, the seminars do not assume any specific course or background on the student'spart. Enrollment is usually limited to 16 students. The seminars are given only in the fall semester, and the offerings change somewhat from year to year. A brochure describing all the fall courses and their instruc-tors appears in late spring. Below is a sampling of recent seminars.Collegiate Seminars (70) SILVER CENTER, 100 WASHINGTON SQUARE EAST, ROOM 908, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6688. 212-998-8102. CoursesThe Cultural Nature of LanguageV70.0101 Schieffelin. 4 points. From accents and pronouns toswearing and spelling, how oneuses language is never value-free.We examine language use as asocial practice and analyze howspeakers and their language(s) areevaluated and regulated across arange of contexts and cultures.Starting with how children learnto talk, or don't (for example, feralchildren), we examine speech andsilence across a range of societies.We also look at popular attitudestoward language and the practicesby which people regulate its use inthe media (for example, politicalcorrectness), in legal and educa-tional institutions (such as \"English only\"), and in multilin-gual cities (such as Barcelona andMontreal) to understand how ideasabout language are often recruitedto nonlinguistic concerns, such aswho should be included orexcluded. In thinking about thecultural nature of language in thisway, we critically explore issues ofidentity and authority. Terrorism, Nihilism, and ModernityV70.0102 Gilligan. 4 points. The past century has witnessedviolence of such a unique andunprecedented character and scalethat we have had to create a newvocabulary to describe it (genocide,terrorism) and its underlying ide- ologies (totalitarianism, fundamen-talism). To understand modernviolence, we examine the origin ofthe modern mind in the 17th cen-tury, when science, based on uni-versal doubt, ended the Age ofFaith, and the traditional sourcesof moral, legal, and politicalauthority lost credibility.Nietzsche called this the \"death ofGod\" (and the devil); it could alsobe called the death of good andevil, leading to another set of newwords (nihilism, agnosticism,anomie, anarchy). We study theorigins and implications Dostoevsky, Beckett95 COLLEGIATE Wittgenstein, Simone Weil and Hannah Arendt, as well asmodern mass murderers fromHitler to bin Laden. Finally, weask whether the modern humansciences can help us understandhow to reverse or at least limit thisescalation of violence. Saying and Meaning: Intersections of Poetry andPhilosophyV70.0103 Gerety. 4 points. Explores the sometimes uncertainboundary between poetry and phi-losophy. Every poet is saying some-thing to himself or herself\u2014aswell as to readers. Rarely do poetscontent themselves with soundsalone, or even images alone; often,they make arguments. Philo-sophers, on the other hand, havelong been thought to engage theirreaders, their students, solely witharguments. Yet from the earliestdays, philosophers have usedimagery and myth to make sense ofthe world and to make \"argu-ments\" about it. We seek to moveback and forth between poetry andphilosophy to understand bothbetter, reading, criticizing, andimitating several of the mostpoetic philosophers and philo-sophic poets. These include poetsand philosophers both ancient andmodern, writing in English as wellas in other languages in transla-tion. Among the authors likelycovered are Sappho Pessoa, as several contemporary poets. In Search of Lost Time V70.0104 Clements. 4 points. We read Proust (in translation) ashe should be read: hedonistically,with respect and admiration butalso delectation. A prodigiousnovel of 4,500 pages, In Search of Lost Time addresses literature's rich- est theme, desire\u2014its remem-brance, transformation, perversion,defeat, and final resurgence in theform of art. Nearly 100 years old,often said to be the first modernnovel, it remains a dazzling socialhistory of the French beau monde and, even more, of the power andelegance of its author's sensibility.It is still unparalleled in how itcombines self-examination with social history, extraordinary psy-chological acuity with the study ofglamour and decadence, as well ashow it merges an audacious explo-sion of form with explorations ofmemory, attachment, deception,lust, jealousy, ambition, disap-pointment, and ennui. It is alsoone of the most pleasurable andelating reads. But although MarcelProust (1871-1922) is usuallyassumed to be France's greatestnovelist, his prose is so layered andbrilliant that, unfortunately, manyreaders never get past the first 50pages, reading the same gorgeoussentences again and again. Butwhile In Search of Lost Time's prose style (playing on association, evo-cation, magnification, punning,rhythm) may have been its mostradical contribution to the art ofthe novel, it cannot be understooduntil it has been read once in itsentirety. In this seminar, we moveat a brisk pace through the work,merely glancing at its riches on ourway, until we arrive at theuniquely euphoric experience ofreading the final volume, Time Regained . Required reading: an average of 350 pages per week. Pharmaceutical Drugs, Ethics, and CultureV70.0105 Scicchitano. 4 points. Designed to introduce students tocontemporary issues in the realmof pharmaceuticals, focusing ondrug design, safety, and distribu-tion. Early in the seminar, studentsare introduced to the basic con-cepts of drug research and testing,with an emphasis on the Food andDrug Administration rules forbringing a drug to the clinic andeventually to the marketplace.This leads to the complex issuesrelated to drug distribution insideand outside the United States, thesocietal implications associatedwith new therapeutic regimens,and the economic factors and lawsthat come into play. The seminaralso develops students' writing,critical thinking, and presentationskills, with emphasis on research-ing, evaluating, and presentingevidence. Students who have takenV23.0005 may not register for thisseminar.American Wars, Past and Present: Vietnam and IraqV70.0106 Young. 4 points. Considers the last major war of the20th century and the first of the21st. The history, memory, andpolitical uses of the Vietnam Warare the subject of the first part ofthe course; the ongoing influenceof that war on contemporary poli-tics occupies the second. The wayGulf War I (Operation DesertStorm) was fought and reportedupon was shaped by the specificunderstanding the administrationof George H. W . Bush had of theVietnam War. The current war inthe Gulf (Operation IraqiFreedom) was, of course, shaped bythe outcome of the first Gulf War,but it has also been fought in theshadow of Vietnam analogies usedby those who support the war aswell those who oppose it. Thecourse examines these analogieswith some care. The overarchingconcern is the ongoing haunting ofAmerican politics\u2014military andcivilian\u2014by a war fought overthree decades ago. There twoconnected questions: Can historyteach? What does it teach? Zoo\u00ebsis: Animal Acts for Changing TimesV70.0107 Chaudhuri. 4 points. The emerging field of animal stud-ies has already generated neolo-gisms in various disciplines:\"anthrozoology\" (culture studies),\"zoopolis\" (urban social theory), and\"zoontology\" (philosophy). To thesethe fields of literature and perfor-mance studies propose an addition,\"zoo\u00ebsis,\" to refer to the history ofanimal representation thatstretches, in the Western literarytradition, from Aesop's Fables to Will Self's Great Apes ; in the Western dramatic tradition, fromAristophanes's The Frogs to Albee's The Goat; in film, from Muybridge's \"zoogyroscope\" to Herzog's Grizzly Man; in popular culture, from Mickey Mouse to Animal Planet ; and in popular performance, fromgladiatorial contests to Siegfriedand Roy. To speak of zoo\u00ebsis is alsoto acknowledge the manifold per-formances engendered by culturalanimal practices such as dog shows,keeping pets, equitation, rodeo,bullfighting, animal sacrifice, scien-tific experimentation, taxidermy,96 COLLEGIATE SEMINARShunting, wearing fur, eating meat\u2014each with its own archiveand repertory, its own performersand spectators. We study recentfilms, novels, plays, and culturalevents that reveal how our interac-tion with animals shapes our under-standing of the human, ourapproach to the \"Other\" (includingthe racial and ethnic Other), andour attitude toward the world. Matter, Dark Matter, and Dark EnergyV70.0108 Farrar. 4 points. The past several decades have seentremendous advances in observa-tional cosmology. As a result, weunderstand in remarkable detailmany aspects of the evolution andcontents of the universe. Thiscourse focuses on three of the mostpuzzling facts about the universe:Why was there a slight excess ofmatter over antimatter after theBig Bang? (Otherwise, after mat-ter-antimatter annihilation wascomplete, no matter would havebeen left.) What is dark matter?(Although on average in the uni-verse it is five times more abun-dant than normal matter, we knowthat it is something not found onEarth or, so far, observed in ourlaboratories.) What is so-called\"dark energy\"? (The expansion rateof the universe is actually acceler-ating, rather than slowing down aswas expected, a finding attributedto this new component of the uni-verse.) Students enrolling in theseminar should have taken APPhysics, be enrolled in Physics I(V83.0091), or have permission ofthe instructor. How We See V70.0109 Carrasco. 4 points. Do we see the world the way we dobecause we are the way we are orbecause the world is the way it is?The ease with which we compre-hend the visual world and recog-nize objects and events makes ittempting to think that the worldis just the way we see it and totake our perceptual capabilities forgranted. But when we comprehendthat we cannot process all theinformation available in the envi-ronment, when we try to buildmachines that can see, or when weencounter people who have lostsome specific visual capability\u2014for example, those who can no longer recognize faces\u2014we realizehow extraordinary and intricate arethe machinery and mechanisms ofsight. This course looks at what weknow about vision from multiplescientific perspectives. Perceptualpsychology tells us about theprocess of seeing and providesimportant insights into the work-ings of visual mechanisms; neu-ropsychology shows us whathappens to perception when thesemechanisms malfunction; neuro-science tells us about processes atthe level of cells and neural sys-tems. At the same time, we discussmodes and techniques of scientificinquiry from these different per-spectives. How do vision scientistslearn? What kinds of experimentsdo they conduct? How has new neuroimagingtechniques field? Life's Ends, in Aristotle, Nietzsche, and DarwinismV70.0110 Richardson. 4 points. We share a very strong impressionthat nature\u2014especially organismsor life\u2014has a purposiveness ordesign, is somehow aimed at ends.But we generally take science, andDarwinian biology in particular, tooppose this first impression and topush ends or purposes quite out ofnature. This course examines thatstrong sense of the teleology (end-directedness) of life or nature andconsiders how it really stands up toa scientific or naturalistic view.Part of our attention is historical,focusing on two very differentphilosophers, Aristotle andNietzsche, who are alike in theirvery strong allegiance to science,yet also in their insistence onexplaining life by its ends or goals.Why do they so insist\u2014andNietzsche even after Darwin?Another part of our attention ismore contemporary: what evolu-tionary theory entails in terms ofwhether organisms have ends. Wediscuss how even the most currentscience may still leave room forteleology. Readings are fromAristotle, Nietzsche, and the con-temporary philosophy of biology.Great Science, Fabulous Science, and Voodoo ScienceV70.0111 Mincer. 4 points. Science is often portrayed as fol-lowing a very clearly defined set ofprocedures: start with a hypothesis,do an experiment, and, based onthe results, reject the hypothesis oradopt it as a working assumption.The actual process, however, israrely so straightforward. In addi-tion, the stories as usually told orrecorded may differ from whatreally happened. We study somefamous and infamous experiments,mainly in the physical sciences,selected to illustrate intellectualtours de force, cases of error, casesof fraud, and the murky boundariesbetween them. Along the way,issues such as the discarding of\"faulty data,\" theoretical bias, andprobabilistic tools for hypothesisacceptance and rejection are dis-cussed. To take this course, stu-dents should have had high schoolchemistry, physics, and calculus. Daily Life in China, 1750-1950 V70.0112 W aley-Cohen. 4 points. Historians of the West often drawa link between the development ofa consumer society and the onset ofmodernity, examining patterns ofdaily life in such centers as Londonand Paris from no later than the18th century. This seminar exam-ines such patterns in the context ofChina from the high imperial erathrough the first half of the 20thcentury. The goal is to give stu-dents a range of knowledge suffi-cient to use as a basis forcomparison and an understandingof the analytical issues involved.Using a combination of primarydocuments, fiction, and secondarysources, we explore a variety ofquestions: What was distinctiveabout the experience of urbanChinese in late imperial and earlymodern times? What was theshape of an ordinary day? How didarchitecture reflect gender norms?Who belonged to a typical house-hold (family members, concubines,servants, and the like)? How didchildren learn? What forms didsocial life take? How was the rever-ing of ancestors incorporated intofamily life? What were people'sdifferent work experiences? Howdid people acquire necessities suchas food and clothing or luxuries97 COLLEGIATE SEMINARSsuch as antiques? Other questions may emerge in the course of thesemester. Active participation inclass discussion, short researchassignments, and a final paper arethe main requirements. Making Sense of Monsters and MasksV70.0113 Miller. 4 points. Human beings give shape to fearsand desires through art. All cul-tures participate in this form ofemotional exteriorization, includ-ing creating through myth and lit-erature \"monsters\" and textures and words various typesof \"masks.\" We concentrate onmonsters and masks in several cul-tures for whom the French lan-guage is a major expressive form.We will thus chart the meaningand impact of the archetypalmasked figures of the commedia dell'arte in French theatre, the obsessive concern with thegrotesque person (the monstrousmask) in French romanticism,zombification and carnival figuresin Caribbean cultural forms, and raptor masks and transformativegu\u00e9risseur s or healers in Francophone West African works. We build arepertory of approaches to inter-preting and uncovering the manylayers of masking and monstrous-ness by readings in anthropology,psychoanalysis, aesthetics, and lit-erary theory: After all, just as inter-esting as the masks and monsters\"peopling\" the world are the waysin which humans at various pointsin time have attempted to under-stand what making masks andmonsters means. (All readings willbe in English.) James Joyce and Comparative LiteratureV70.0115 Hamilton. 4 points. Focuses on Joyce's first novel,A Portrait of the Artist as a YoungMan (1916), situating it within the broad discipline of comparativeliterature. As a student of modernlanguages, Joyce composed a stun-ning work of art that recognizesand is conversant with complexstrands of a European tradition that demand critical attention. Inaddition to reading and discussingclosely what has been judged oneof the greatest 20th-century novelsin English, participants are invitedto delve into this rich every Aristotle, Vergil,Aquinas, Dante, Shakespeare,Milton, Goethe, Byron, andFlaubert, as well as passages fromother works by Joyce, interruptand thereby challenge approachesto the novel to interrogate a host ofthematic and theoretical issues,such as autobiography and fiction,notions of genius and creativity,characterizations of childhood andadolescence, and the bold claims ofliterary modernism. Over thecourse of the seminar, students areintroduced to the basic premisesand methods of literary criticism,including philology, hermeneutics,intertextuality, narratology, andsome general problems in aesthet-ics and philosophy.Comparative literature is an innovative, interdisciplinary major that allows stu- dents to explore literature and literary questions unfettered by national bordersand institutional boundaries. In comparative literature, students develop a mul- tifaceted critical approach that both emphasizes the integrity of literature and expandsan understanding of textuality to include all cultural artifacts and modes of thoughtthat involve language and representation. The Department of Comparative Literatureencourages students to pursue theoretical and philosophical modes of reading whileengaging texts and developing an understanding of the theory and non-English prac-tice of translation. To interrogate how literature is enmeshed in nonliterary contexts,comparative literature majors may develop expertise in relevant, related disciplinessuch as art history, philosophy, history, anthropology, and cinema studies. Comparativeliterature departmental course offerings include classes in world literature and interdis-ciplinary studies where students work intensively with a distinguished faculty of schol-ars in African, Caribbean, Chinese, European and Anglo-American, Japanese, LatinAmerican, Middle Eastern and Islamic, and Russian and Slavic literary studies.DEPARTMENT OF Comparative Literature (29) 13 UNIVERSITY PLACE, NEW YORK, NY 10003-4573. 212-998-8790. www.nyu.edu/fas/dept/complit CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Lezra DIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES: Assistant Professor Vatulescu 98 COMPARATIVE LITERATUREFacultyProfessor Emeritus and Distinguished Scholar inResidence:Reiss Collegiate Professor; Professor OBJECTIVES The undergraduate major is designed to foster serious work inliterature at the advanced level,while giving students a strongbackground in critical and culturalanalysis and a keen ability to posequestions and write with lucidityand force. The major provides anideal intellectual site for studentsto draw connections across cul-tures, periods, genres, and disci-plines in a rigorous yet individu- ally designed way. A comparativeliterature major could lead to theadvanced study of literature at thegraduate level but could just asreadily be a strong basis foradvanced degrees and/or careers inpublishing, journalism, interna-tional relations, international law,cultural studies, medicine, philoso-phy, education, public policy, filmand entertainment industries, theInternet, and computer software. GENERAL INFORMATION Many comparative literature majorswish to study literature in its inter-national contexts, having masteredone or more foreign literatures.However, such mastery is notrequired in all courses or of allmajors, and courses are open to awide range of nonmajors with eclec-tic and interdisciplinary interests.99 COMPARATIVE LITERATUREDECLARATION OF MAJOR To declare a major, a student must successfully complete one courseoriginating in the Department ofComparative Literature. As withother CAS majors, such a declara-tion must be made by studentswho have earned 64 or morepoints. Because of the rigorous aca-demic requirements of the depart-ment, however, students withfewer than 64 points are strongly encouraged to declare the major as early in their academic career aspossible. Special note: Students planning on a junior year termabroad must consult and declarewith the director of undergraduatestudies in the Department ofComparative Literature before their departure. MAJOR To declare a major, a student mustsuccessfully complete one courseoffered by the Department ofComparative Literature.

Fields couldinclude history, art history, reli-gion, philosophy, classics, poli-tics, cinema studies, and so on,and could also be another foreignlanguage or literary area. If thenational literature departmentselected for specialization isEnglish, these two courses mustbe in a foreign language. Thechoice of these courses will bemade in consultation with theadviser to form a coherent intel-lectual field and a defined objec-tive in the major. Track 2: Literary and Cultural Studies. Track 2 includes the fol- lowing requirements: Four courses originating in the Department of ComparativeLiterature, including Introductionto Comparative Literature and theJunior Theory Seminar.

Computer science is an academic discipline rooted in mathematics, as well as a practical art underlying innovation in business, science, economics, graphicdesign, communications, government, and education. The value of a computer science degree in a liberal arts program is consistently growing due to demand for grad-uates with both general knowledge and specialized skills. The department offers three major programs: the computer science major, the joint computer science/mathematics major, and the joint economics/computer sciencemajor. The department also offers three minor programs: the computer science minor,the computer applications minor, and the joint computer science/mathematics minor.The goal of the majors is to train students in fundamental principles of computer sci-ence as well as many practical aspects of software development. The goal of the minorsis to train students to be proficient users of computers and computer software with lessemphasis on mathematical tools. Courses combine practical programming experiencewith techniques for analyzing problems and designing computer algorithms. Advanced undergraduate students can work on a variety of research projects with the faculty. Outstanding undergraduates may pursue a master's degree through anaccelerated five-year program.DEPARTMENT OF Computer Science (22) 251 MERCER STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10012-1110. 212-998-3010. www.cs.nyu.edu DIRECTOR, COURANT INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICALSCIENCES: Professor Greengard CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Wright DIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES: Professor Shoup 102 COMPUTER SCIENCEFacultyProfessors Emeriti: M.

The undergraduate Program in Creative Writing offers students the opportunity to immerse themselves in the writing life with workshops, readings, intern-ships, and events designed to cultivate and inspire. Our popular minor in cre- ative writing provides students with an exciting progression of course work, rangingfrom an introduction to the fundamentals of the craft to more advanced, substantiveexplorations of specific forms and genres. The program's distinguished faculty of award-winning poets and prose writers represents a wide array of contemporary aesthetics, from the experimental to the tradi-tional. In recent years, our creative writing instructors have been the recipients ofGuggenheim and NEA fellowships, the National Book Award, the National BookCritics Circle Award, the Pushcart Prize, and the Whiting Writer's Award. The very location of the undergraduate Program in Creative Writing suggests an intersection of past and present, of echoes and new coinages. Just steps from whereHenry James was born, and e. e. cummings penned his peculiar punctuations, andMarianne Moore donned her tricornered and Willa pioneers, andWalt Whitman loafed, and Ginsberg howled, NYU's undergraduate program stands atthe crossroads of literary history and contemporary experiment. Undergraduates are encouraged to attend the Creative Writing Program Reading Series, a vital component of the program, which brings both established andnew writers to NYU. Writing prizes, receptions, special events, and our undergraduateliterary journal, West 10th, further complement our course offerings and establish a sense of community among undergraduate writers.

The faculty at New York University is particularly strong in economic theory, macroeconomics, internationaleconomics, and economic growth and development. Although the department is large,its students enjoy an excellent student-faculty rapport. Many of the faculty members areassociated with distinguished research institutions. By being able to study with facultywho are actively engaged in research, students learn not only about the fundamentals ofeconomic theory but also about how such theory is utilized. They have the opportunityto conduct research on their own. Honors students are required to write a research paperas an honors thesis under direct faculty supervision. Students majoring in economics have many options open to them after gradu- ation. The major prepares them for graduate school in economics, business manage-ment, or public administration. Preprofessional students will find that an economicsmajor not only fosters the discipline medical or law school demands, but provides asolid foundation for these and other careers. Studying economics at New YorkUniversity is especially rewarding because of the urban environment. Students oftenfind career opportunities on Wall Street, at the United Nations, or in various corporate,financial, governmental, agency, and nonprofit institutional settings.DEPARTMENT OF Economics (31) 19 WEST FOURTH STREET, 6TH FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10012-1119. 212-998-8900. www.econ.nyu.edu CHAIRMAN OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Pearce DIRECTOR STUDIES: Professor Ramsey 125 ECONOMICSFacultyProfessor Emeritus: Kirzner Paulette Goddard Professor of Political Economy:Benhabib Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Economics:Gertler Jay Gould Professor of Economics:NadiriSilver Professors; Professors of Economics:Gale, Assistant Professor: Thapar Global Distinguished Professor: Ljungqvist126 ECONOMICSProgram MAJOR In order to allow students to select an approach to the study of eco-nomics that is more suitable totheir personal aptitudes and inter-ests, a major in economics can betaken in either of two concentra-tions, as described below. If a student fails a course required for the major, the coursemust be retaken in the depart-ment; a course taken outside theUniversity will not be allowed tosubstitute for a failed course. Nocourse for the major may be takenas pass/fail. A grade of C or better is required for a course to be countedtoward the major in economics.Transfer students should note thatnormally the only courses that willbe accepted toward the major ineconomics are courses that havebeen passed with a grade of C orbetter at universities with anintensive four-year program. While AP credit in economics with a grade of 4 or 5 is accept-able, it does not reduce the totalnumber of courses required for themajor or minor. AP credit in sta-tistics is not acceptable for eco-nomics majors. AP credit does notapply to V31.0005. Policy concentration: The policy concentration is intended for thestudent who is primarily interestedin applying economic analysis toan understanding of economicproblems and policies. The intro-ductory and intermediate coursesprovide the student with a solidfoundation of economic theorywith an emphasis on economicapplications. The elective coursesallow students to focus on specificproblems and topics that matchtheir interests and career plans. The policy concentration corre- sponds most closely to the eco-nomics major that is offered by theleading colleges and universitiesaround the country. While mathe-matics is used to build an under-standing of theory, the focus is ongraphical analysis, the intuitionbehind the theory, and applica-tions. This concentration is partic-ularly well suited for studentsplanning careers in law, public pol-icy, business, or any other field inwhich a thorough understanding ofthe economic way of thinkingwould be beneficial. However, stu- dents in the policy concentrationcan also pursue a Ph.D. in econom-ics or finance if they supplementtheir course work with additionalcourses in mathematics. At least 42 points (10 courses) are to be taken in the Department of Economics: six core courses(V31.0001, V31.0002, V31.0010,V31.0012, electives, at least twomust be numbered V31.0300-0399. A typical sequence of courses consists of the following: by sopho-more year, V31.0001, V31.0002,and V31.0018; senior year, four elec-tives. Note: Statistics is to be taken as early as possible. Senior-levelcourses (300 level and above) pre-sume a knowledge of statistics. Students are strongly advised to pay close attention to the prerequi-sites for each course. Studentsshould be aware that Algebra andCalculus (V63.0009), or its required (V31.0001 and V31.0002).Students intending to major ineconomics must have a strongworking knowledge of algebra and introductory calculus.Furthermore, a course in calculus(V63.0121) is required for theintermediate courses and statistics(V31.0010, V31.0012, andV31.0018). A grade of C or betteris needed to pass the mathematicsrequirements. Both EconomicPrinciples I (V31.0001) Principles II (V31.0002)are required for intermediatemacroeconomics (V31.0012). Theory concentration: The the- ory concentration is intended forthe student who wishes to beginthe formal study of economic rea-soning with an emphasis on mas-tering the analytical tools. Thisconcentration relies on a higherlevel of abstraction and focuses ontechniques of economic analysisrather than on the understandingof specific economic problems orinstitutions. It is particularly wellsuited for students who intend topursue a Ph.D. degree in econom-ics or higher degrees in quantita-tive fields such as finance.At least 40 points (10 courses) are to be taken in the Departmentof Economics: electives must becourses numbered V31.0300-0399and designated as theory classes. Students are strongly advised to pay close attention to the prerequi-sites for each course. Furthermore,students must complete V63.0121,V63.0122, and V63.0123. Thesecalculus courses should be com-pleted before or during the stu-dent's first year in the program. A typical sequence of courses consists of the following: by sopho-more year, electives. Students with permission from thedirector of undergraduate studiesmay change from the policy con-centration to the theory concentra-tion, or vice versa; however, certainrules apply. In either case, nocourse may be taken for which thestudent does not have the appro-priate prerequisites; this includesthe mathematics prerequisites. Transferring between concen- trations after students have com-pleted any of the intermediatecourses is very difficult, more so ingoing from the policy to the theoryconcentration. Students who areunsure about which concentrationto take should seek departmentaladvice before beginning theirmajor. For those switching into thetheory concentration from policy,V31.0001 or V31.0002 can besubstituted for a from topolicy, V31.0005 may substitutefor V31.0002. JOINT MAJOR IN ECONOM- ICS AND MATHEMATICS A joint major is offered by the Departments of Economics andMathematics. In the economicsdepartment, joint majors withmathematics may only take thetheory sequence. Nine courses mustbe taken from each department. The mathematics requirements are a total of nine courses. The six127 ECONOMICSrequired courses are as plus any three eco-nomics elective courses, at leasttwo of which must be theory elec-tives numbered V31.0300-0399. Interested students should con- sult with the director of undergrad-uate studies in both departmentsfor additional information. JOINT MAJOR IN ECONOMICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE This is an interdisciplinary major offered by the Department ofComputer Science with theDepartment of Economics. Thereare requirements in three depart-ments, including the Departmentof Mathematics. A grade of C orbetter is required in all courses. The mathematics requirements are V63.0120, V63.0121,V63.0122, and V63.0123. numbered V22.0400or higher. One of these electivesmay be by any one of thefollowing: any three eco-nomics elective courses, at leasttwo of which must be theory elec-tives numbered V31.0300-0399.One of these electives may bereplaced by V22.0444. Interested students should con- sult with the director of undergrad-uate studies in both departmentsfor additional information. MINOR Students may minor in economicsin either concentration. A minorenables a student to acquire a use-ful understanding of economicconcepts and analysis without thesame degree of coverage as wouldbe obtained in a major. A grade ofC or better is required for a courseto be counted toward the minor ineconomics. Note: If a student failsa course required for the minor, thecourse must be retaken in thedepartment; a course taken outsidethe University will not normallybe allowed to substitute for a failedcourse. No course for the minormay be taken as pass/fail. Policy minor: At least 26 points (six courses) to be taken in theDepartment of Economics, includ-ing V31.0001, V31.0002,V31.0018, either V31.0010 orV31.0012, and two additional 4-point courses for which the student has the prerequisites Theory minor: At least 24 points (six courses) to be taken in theDepartment of Economics,including V31.0005, V31.0006,V31.0020, either V31.0011 orV31.0013, and any other twoelectives in the theory sequence for which the student has the prerequisites HONORS PROGRAM Honors may be taken in eitherconcentration. Students interestedin going to graduate school or pro-fessional schools are strongly urgedto take honors. A 3.65 overall GPAand a 3.65 average in economicscourses are required. Interested students should con- sult with the director of under-graduate studies. For generalrequirements, see the Honors and Awards section of this bulletin. Honors students are required totake at least 46 points (11 courses)in the policy concentration or atleast 44 points (11 courses) in thetheory concentration. Students willneed to begin the process early inthe spring semester of their junioryear. Students who wish to take hon- ors would take the followingcourses: Policy concentration: andtwo honors and two honorscourses (V31.0410 and V31.0450) CoursesNote : Students are encouraged to review the Department ofEconomics Web site (www.econ.nyu .edu/undergrad/courses.html) for more information about the economicsmajor. Students should speak withan advisor in the department tohelp them plan their major.Advisors are located at 19 WestFourth Street, Rooms 836 and 837.In the list of courses below, some courses are designated either \"P\" or\"T\" (or both). \"P\" alone representscourses to be taken only by studentsin the policy concentration; \"T\"alone represents courses to be takenonly by students in the theory con-centration; and \"P , T\" representscourses that may be taken by stu-dents in either concentration.Economics courses for majors fall into several categories: first-and second-year core courses; elec-tive courses at 200-level intermediate core courses asprerequisites.128 ECONOMICSFIRST -YEAR CORE COURSES Economic Principles I (P) V31.0001 Prerequisite: V63.0009 or equivalent.

Studentswho rank near the top of their classand who have done well on stan-dardized tests, particularly inmathematics, are especially wellsuited. Students should have com- pleted a rigorous college prepara-tion program, includingmathematics (through trigonome-try), chemistry, and physics, andexhibited substantial extracurricu-lar activity and leadership.Students are usually admitted tothe program as freshmen and mustbe prepared to begin with CalculusI (V63.0121) in the first semesterof college. Given the highly struc-tured curricula, transfer into theprogram after the first year is verydifficult. Students must maintainsatisfactory performance and mustcomplete the required courses in atimely fashion in order to remainin the program. Their records arereviewed yearly by a faculty com-mittee, and students are approvedby this committee for transfer toStevens at the end of the third year. THE PROGRAM Students accepted into the pro-gram spend their first three yearsof study in the College of Arts andScience at New York University. Inthe first year at the College, thedifferent curricula call for many ofthe same courses. This gives stu-dents time to consult with facultyat both schools before committingthemselves to a particular science/engineering major. A typical first-year program might consist of thefollowing courses: Fall semester: Writing the Essay (V40.0100); a course from theMorse Academic Plan (MAP);Calculus I (V63.0121);Engineering Design Laboratory I(V37.0111); and either GeneralChemistry I (V25.0101) andGeneral Chemistry Laboratory I(V25.0103), or Introduction to Computer Science I (V22.0101). Spring semester: A course from the Morse Academic Plan (MAP);Calculus II (V63.0122);Engineering Design Laboratory II(V37.0112); EngineersI either II (V25.0102) Chemistry Laboratory II(V25.0104), or Introduction toComputer Science II (V22.0102). At the end of the first year, if they have not already done so, stu-dents select a major area for theirremaining two years of study atNew York University from the dis-ciplines of biology, chemistry,computer science, mathematics,and physics. Seminars by Stevens depart- mental faculty advisers and by pro-fessional engineering leaders fromprivate firms are included in theSociety of Engineering Students'weekly meetings to provide infor-mation to students about opportu-nities in the various engineeringfields represented. Students shouldchoose their desired engineeringmajor by the end of the secondyear. In the spring of the thirdyear, an orientation program helpsstudents prepare for the transitionto Stevens in the fourth year. Inthese first three years of the pro-gram, students also satisfy theirMAP requirements. In the firstyear, students are introduced to theengineering design experiencewith Engineering DesignLaboratory I and II. In the secondand third years, students arerequired to take additional engi-neering courses, taught by Stevensfaculty at the Washington Squarecampus. These courses are all sub-jects in the \"core\" engineering cur-riculum, taken by all engineeringstudents, regardless of engineeringmajor. These courses are at the firstlevel of engineering study and givestudents an opportunity to learnthe technical feel of various engi-neering subjects. The second-yearcourses are Mechanics of Solids,(V37.5126) and Lab\u2014CAD (V37.5211). courses are Circuits (V37.7245), Instrumentation (V37.7246),and Engineering Design Lab IV(V37.0232). These introductorycourses must be completed prior toentering the fourth year at Stevens. These are difficult curricula, and some programs may requiresummer courses for some students.Stevens has permitted students inthe program tuition-free enroll-ment in a few summer coursesoffered only at Stevens (but not atNYU) to assist students in main-taining curricular progress.Students may elect to withdrawfrom the dual-degree program inengineering and complete only theCollege of Arts and Science generaland major requirements at NewYork University. Financial aid andscholarships, housing, dining, andother services are provided by NewYork University during the firstthree years. The final two years of study are undertaken at Stevens Institute ofTechnology at Castle Point inHoboken, New Jersey, directlyacross the Hudson River and ashort PATH train ride from NewYork University's GreenwichVillage campus. At Stevens, students complete the remaining technical courses,the majority of the engineeringcourses, and the senior design proj-ect in the fifth year. Programs inengineering available to studentsin the NYU-Stevens dual-degreeprogram include biomedical engineering,civil engineering, computer engi-neering, electrical engineering,environmental engineering, andmechanical engineering. In the last two years of the pro- gram, financial aid, housing, din-ing, and other services are providedby Stevens at the Castle Point cam-pus. Separate transcripts are sup-plied by the two schools, andstudents may make use of the facil-ities of the career and placementoffices of both institutions.135 ENGINEERINGCoursesEngineering Design Laboratory I and IIV37.0111,0112 Offered as a sequence every fall/spring. 1 point eachterm.Introductory course in engineeringpractices and principles of designof a new product.

The Center also offers a full program of colloquia and workshops dealingwith both Western and Eastern Europe, some open to undergraduate majors and minors.CENTER FOR European and Mediterranean Studies (42) 285 MERCER STREET, 7TH FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6653. 212-998-3838. www.cems.as.nyu.edu DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER: Professor Wolff 150 EUROPEAN AND MEDITERRANEAN STUDIESFaculty2007-2009 Max Weber Chair for German and European Studies:MinkenbergProfessors: Fleming (History), Schain(Politics), Wolff (History)Assistant Professors/Faculty Fellows:Maier (European and MediterraneanStudies), Santarelli (European andMediterranean Studies) Program MAJOR With the help of the European andMediterranean Studies adviser, stu-dents prepare a preliminary pro-gram outline at the time theydeclare their major. Althoughthere are no formal tracks, coursesare normally organized around theinterests of a student in one of twoways: an emphasis on contempo-rary European and Mediterraneansocieties\u2014their problems and poli-cies; or an emphasis on contempo-rary European and Mediterraneancultures\u2014their ideas, values, andartistic and literary trends. Theprogram enables students to organ-ize their courses around a practicalor theoretical problem in contem-porary European society or culturethat is applicable to one or severalcountries. A typical problemmight include such subjects as thechanging impact of politics on cul-ture and social cleavages; changingpatterns of religious expression inEurope; literary expression and changing society in Europe; theEuropean approach to urban prob-lems; migration and ethnicity inEurope; equality and inequality inEurope; and democratic transitionin Europe. The problem, for whichthe tools of several academic disci-plines should be applicable, will bethe basis for the major researchproject. Majors in European and Mediterranean studies must haveor attain advanced-level knowledgeof a major European languageother than English (such as French,Spanish, Portuguese, Italian,German, Greek, or Russian). Inorder to prove this knowledge, stu-dents must successfully completean advanced-level language course.The alternative to this is to passthe College of Arts and Science(CAS) proficiency exam prior tograduation. Ten courses beyond theintroductory level that deal withEurope and the Mediterranean arerequired: two in history; two in lit- erature (preferably in the languageof specialization); two in the socialsciences; two in philosophy, arthistory, or cinema studies; one sen-ior honors seminar in Europeanstudies; and one independent studyduring the final semester, throughwhich a grade is earned for the sen-ior thesis. A sequence of coursesmight begin with two advancedhistory courses and two literaturecourses in the sophomore and/orjunior years, followed by two socialscience and two philosophy, arthistory, and/or cinema studiescourses. The interdisciplinary sen-ior honors seminar should be takenduring the first semester of thesenior year. Majors are alsorequired to complete at least onesemester of study abroad. Studentsmay petition the director of thecenter for exemption from thisrequirement.151 EUROPEAN AND MEDITERRANEAN STUDIESMINOR All students minoring in European and Mediterranean studies mustdemonstrate proficiency in at leastone European language above theintermediate level (such as French,German, Italian, Portuguese,Spanish, or Greek). They must alsofulfill the following course require-ments: one course in modernEuropean course oreconomics (V53.0150, V14.0111,or V31.0224); and three additionalcourses German, orSpanish civilization. No more thantwo of these courses may focus onany one specific country. All courseprograms must be designed in con-sultation with the center's under-graduate program adviser. B.A./M.A. PROGRAM This program offers qualifyingmajors in European andMediterranean studies the oppor-tunity to earn both the B.A. andthe M.A. degrees at reducedtuition cost. By completing someof their graduate requirementswhile still undergraduates, stu-dents finish the program in a max-imum of five years. In the graduateportion of the program, studentsreceive a fellowship that covers upto half of the tuition for thecourses required for the M.A. European and Mediterranean studies majors may apply foradmission to the program afterthey have completed at least 48points in the College, but notmore than 96 credits or six semes-ters, whichever comes first.Students apply for admission tothe B.A./M.A. program throughthe CAS Advising Center.Applications are reviewed by theGraduate Admission Committee ofthe Center for European andMediterranean Studies, using thenormal criteria for the M.A. pro- gram, except that applicants arenot required to take the GRE. Thecommittee bases its decision onstudents' undergraduate recordsand recommendations of NYUinstructors. A working knowledge at an advanced level of a European lan-guage (other than English) isrequired to complete the program,and knowledge of a secondEuropean language is encouraged.Students must spend at least onesemester in an approved academicprogram in Europe, normally dur-ing their junior year. Students arealso required to write a senior hon-ors thesis and a master's thesis orspecial project (see below) to earnthe two degrees. The program requires a total of 18 courses: 10 undergraduatecourses and eight graduate courses.For the first four years, studentsfocus their work on a \"problemarea\" that will eventually becomethe subject of their master's thesis,should they choose this option.The senior honors thesis is an inte-grative project within the problemarea developed by the student andhis or her adviser. It may be anexpansion of a research paper writ-ten for an undergraduate course. The graduate portion of the degree comprises three tracks\u2014European Politics and Policy,European Culture and Society, andMediterranean Studies\u2014and stu-dents must choose one of these bythe beginning of their fifth year.Of the eight graduate courses, twoare required (a graduate researchseminar or an independent studyin European and MediterraneanStudies, as well as a graduate intro-ductory course, G42.2301, WhatIs Europe?). Students select sixadditional graduate courses in theirchosen track. A four-credit intern-ship, approved by the center, isrecommended. Each student's program is organized with his or her adviser atthe time that he or she enters theprogram. The first draft of the the-sis is developed in the undergradu- ate Seminar on European andMediterranean Studies (V42.0300),taken in the fall semester of thefourth year. The master's thesis is arevision of this project and is fur-ther developed in the graduateResearch Seminar (G42.3000),taken in the fall semester of thefifth year. The M.A. thesis or spe-cial project will be defended at anoral examination during the springsemester of the fifth year. EUROSIM EUROSIM is an annual modelEuropean Union simulationdesigned to enhance students'classroom knowledge of the work-ings of a politically and economi-cally integrated Europe. Thesimulation exercise models the leg-islative procedure of the EuropeanUnion from the introduction of adraft resolution by the EuropeanCommission to the acceptance (orrejection) of an amended documentby the European Council. Each year, New York State col- leges and universities send a dele-gation of undergraduate studentsto EUROSIM to represent one ofthe member states of the EuropeanUnion and the EuropeanCommission. The legislation onwhich delegates work is focused onone main theme chosen for its rele-vance to current European issues.Students individually play theroles of real-life government minis-ters, members of the EuropeanParliament, and members of theEconomic and Social Committeeand the Committee of the Regions. EUROSIM is held in alternat- ing years in the United States andin Europe. In addition, severalEuropean universities send stu-dents to be part of their respectivemember state delegations along-side the American students. In thisway, U.S. students receive a\"home-grown\" perspective on theissues that they are debating.152 EUROPEAN AND MEDITERRANEAN STUDIESCoursesEurope Since 1945 V42.0156 Identical to V57.0156. 4 points.See description under History (57).

PROFICIENCY EXAMINATION EWP administers the Proficiency Examination to external transferstudents. All external transfer stu-dents must pass the examination tograduate. Students who fail theexam will be placed in WritingTutorial (V40.0013).The Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC) sequence of the Morse Academic Plan (MAP) seeks to provide students with the perspective and intel-lectual methods to comprehend the development of our human cultures. The four FCC courses introduce students to the modes of inquiry by which societies may bestudied, social issues analyzed, and artistic activity explored. Together, they give under-graduates a broad methodological background on which to draw when later engaged inthe more focused work of their major courses of study. As a result, students receive aricher education than any single major could provide. Through this core experience in humanistic and social-scientific inquiry and its focus on a number of similar readings across different course sections, the FCCframework allows students to enter into dialogue with one another despite differencesin their course schedules, and in this way also encourages lifelong habits of intellectualcuriosity and engagement. As they learn the sound employment of the academic approaches at the center of their FCC classes, students develop their abilities to read critically, think rigorously,and write effectively. By building these skills and an appreciation of the diversity ofhuman experience, the FCC seeks to prepare students for their continued learning inand beyond college, for active participation in their communities, and for lives in a rapidly changing world. All FCC courses are taught by regular faculty, including some of the University's most distinguished professors. In addition to two lectures a week, everyFCC course includes recitation sections led by graduate student preceptors, allowing forsmall-group discussion of the readings, close attention to students' written work, andpersonal concern for students' progress.Foundations of Contemporary Culture (55) SILVER CENTER, 100 WASHINGTON SQUARE EAST, ROOM 903, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6688. 212-998-8119. www.nyu.edu/cas/map DIRECTOR OF THE MORSE ACADEMIC PLAN: Professor Borenstein ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF THE MORSE ACADEMIC PLANFOR FOUNDATIONS OF CONTEMPORARY CULTURE: Clinical Assistant Professor Renzi 155 FOUNDATIONS OF CONTEMPORARY CULTUREProgramDuring their first year, students normally complete a class fromConversations of the West (V55.04XX) and one from World Cultures (V55.05XX), in eitherorder.

A roughly equal divisionbetween Chinese and Japaneseworks is meant to give a basicunderstanding of the broad simi-larities and the less obvious, butall-important, differences amongthe cultures of Confucian Asia.One reading is a Vietnamese adap-tation of a Chinese legend. The lasttwo readings, modern novellasfrom Japan and China, show thereaction of the traditional culturesto the Western invasions. World Cultures: Japan\u2014 A Cultural HistoryV55.0507 Offered every other year. 4 points.A consideration of the prehistoryto Japan's modernist transforma-tion through an analysis of key lit-erary, religious, and artistic texts.Concentrates on the historicalexperiences that produced ele-ments of a national culture beforethere was a nation and on the con-sciousness of being Japanese beforethere was a \"Japan.\" Examines howkey cultural elements were used tomake a modern nation-state.

Itssugar economy and history of slavelabor and colonialism made it thesite of massive transplantations ofpeoples and cultures from Africafor more than four centuries and from Asia since the mid-19th cen- tury, as well as a sizable influx ofpeoples from Europe all along.Readings examine the history ofthe region's differing forms of colo-nialism; the present postcolonialeconomic and political structures;anthropological material on familyand community life, religiousbeliefs and practices, gender roles,and ideologies; and ways in whichnational, ethnic, and racial identi-ties are expressed today. World Cultures: Middle Eastern SocietiesV55.0511 Offered every other year. 4 points.The popular American picture ofthe Middle East as a place of vio-lence, veiled women, and oil wealthportrays none of the richness orcomplexity of most people's lives inthe region. How can we make senseof these seemingly unfamiliar soci-eties and think critically aboutWestern images of the unfamiliar?Questions examined in depthinclude the following: What vari-ety of sources do people in theMiddle East draw on to define theirsense of who they are\u2014as membersof particular households, regions,nations, or religious communities?How do women and men constructtheir gender identity? In what waysare village, town, and city livesbeing transformed? Do people ofthe Middle East experience theirregion's politics the way it is por-trayed in the West?

The Hebrew Bible preservesmuch of the creativity of theancient Israelites, but archaeologi-cal excavations in Israel and neigh-boring lands, as well as thediscovery of ancient writings inHebrew and related languages,have added greatly to our knowl-edge of life as it was lived in bibli-cal times. The civilizations ofEgypt and Syria-Mesopotamia alsoshed light on Israelite culture.

Expressive Culture: Film V55.0750 Offered every semester. 4 points.Film is a medium that combines anumber of arts. It lies at the inter-section of art and technology andof art and mass culture, and at theboundaries of the national and theglobal. Film is also a medium thatcoincides with and contributes tothe invention of modern life. Byexploring the expressive and repre-sentational achievements of cinemain the context of modernity andmass culture, students learn theconcepts to grasp the differentways in which films create mean-ing, achieve their emotionalimpact, and respond in complexways to the historical contexts inwhich they are made.Science and technology play such a central role in the modern world that even indi- viduals not directly engaged in scientific or technical pursuits need to have solidskills in quantitative and analytical reasoning and a clear understanding of scien- tific investigation. Even more than their forebears, citizens of the 21st century will needcompetence and confidence in dealing with the approaches and findings of science ifthey are to make informed decisions on vital political, economic, and social issues.Rather than striving for encyclopedic coverage of facts, Foundations of ScientificInquiry (FSI) courses stress the process of scientific reasoning and seek to illustrate therole of science and mathematics in our understanding of the natural world. The objec - tives of the FSI sequence are to give students who will not be science majors a positiveexperience in scientific inquiry and to encourage learning about how science is done.The quantitative component of these courses emphasizes the critical role of mathemat - ics in the analysis of natural phenomena. The courses within FSI are collected into three groups: Quantitative Reasoning, Natural Science I, and Natural Science II. All lectures are taught by regular faculty , including some of the University' smost distinguished professors, and each course includes workshops or related laboratory sections led by graduate-student preceptors.Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (55) SILVER CENTER, 100 WASHINGTON SQUARE EAST, ROOM 903, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6688. 212-998-8119. www.nyu.edu/cas/map DIRECTOR OF THE MORSE ACADEMIC PLAN: Professor ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF THEMORSE ACADEMIC PLAN FOR FOUNDA TIONS OF SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY: Clinical Assistant Professor Jor dan 160 FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY ProgramIn the FSI sequence, students choose one course in QuantitativeReasoning (V55.01XX), followed by one in the physical sciences from the Natural Science I group- ing (V55.02XX), and then one inthe biological sciences from theNatural Science II grouping (V55.03XX).

Natural Science II: Genomes and DiversityV55.0314 Siegal. Offered every year. 4 points.Millions of species of animals,plants, and microbes inhabit ourplanet. Genomics, the study of allthe genes in an organism, is pro-viding new insights into thisamazing diversity of life. We beginwith the fundamentals of DNA,genes, and genomes. We thenexplore microbial diversity, withan emphasis on how genomics canreveal many aspects of organisms,from their ancient history to theirphysiological and ecological habits.We follow with examinations ofanimal and plant diversity, focus-ing on domesticated species, suchas dogs and tomatoes, as examplesof how genomic methods can beused to identify genes that under-lie new or otherwise interestingtraits. Genomics has also trans-formed the study of human diver-sity and human disease. Weexamine the use of DNA to tracehuman ancestry, as well as the useof genomics as a diagnostic tool inmedicine. With the powerful newtechnologies to study genomes hascome an increased power to manip-ulate them. We conclude by con-sidering the societal implicationsof this ability to alter the genomesof crop plants, livestock, and,potentially, humans.With a staff of internationally known scholars and teachers, the Department of French offers a broad range of courses in French and Francophone stud-ies, language, literature, and civilization. The program promotes oral and written fluency in French, imparts strong analytical and interpretative skills, and workstoward an enhanced understanding of cross-cultural changes. Most courses are taught inFrench. La Maison Fran\u00e7aise brings French culture into focus with films, lectures, andconcerts, as well as library facilities and a periodicals reading room. Beyond theUniversity community, the student of French can find a number of cultural activitiesthat broaden understanding of the foreign perspective here in New York City. Studentsmajoring or minoring in French are strongly encouraged to spend at least one semesterat the NYU Center in Paris, which provides immersion in French culture and offerscourses with professors from the French university system as well as distinguishedNYU faculty members.DEPARTMENT OF French (45) 13 UNIVERSITY PLACE, NEW YORK, NY 10003-4573. 212-998-8700. www.french.as.nyu.edu CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Miller DIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES: Associate Professor Gerson DIRECTOR OF FRENCH LANGUAGE PROGRAMS: Clinical Assistant Professor Moran 164 FRENCHFacultyProfessors Emeriti: Affron, Professor; Professor prerequisite for admission tothe program is a satisfactoryknowledge of the French language.This is normally interpreted as the satisfactory completion ofV45.0030 with the grade of B- orbetter (or an equivalent course orexam).

MINORS IN FRENCH All students who wish to minor inthe Department of French mustregister with the department andconsult a departmental adviserprior to any registration. Students may choose one of four programs of study. They mayminor in French studies, Frenchliterature in translation, literaturein translation, or Francophonestudies. French studies: Four courses con- ducted in French. This minor nor-mally consists of four courses above the intermediate level to be deter-mined in consultation with thedirector of undergraduate studies.No grade lower than C countstoward this minor. French literature in translation: Four courses in French literature intranslation offered by the depart-ment, to be determined in consul-tation with the director ofundergraduate studies. Not opento French majors. No grade lowerthan C counts toward this minor. Literature in translation: See the section Literature in Translation . Francophone studies: Four courses in Francophone studies, tobe determined in consultation withthe director of undergraduate stud-ies. No grade lower than C countstoward this minor. HONORS IN FRENCH Eligibility: A student must spend a minimum of three full semestersin residence at the College of Artsand Science. Attendance at NewYork University in Paris countstoward such residence. The studentmust maintain a general GPA of atleast 3.65 and a major average of3.65 or higher. Students who wishto pursue honors should apply tothe departmental director of hon-ors during their junior year. Requirements: Completion of the major require- ments. An 8-point sequence normally taken senior year, consisting ofHonors Seminar (V45.0991) inthe fall and Honors Thesis(V45.0995) in the spring.Students work on their thesis(see below) starting in the fall, inclose collaboration with thedirector of honors and a facultyadviser. The honors thesis should be a work of scholarship and/or criti-cism in the field of French litera-ture, culture, or Francophonie.The thesis is ordinarily writtenin French (25 pages minimum);students may petition to excep-tionally write it in English (40to 60 pages). The seminar profes-sor and the thesis adviser deter-mine on the basis of this workand an oral defense whether torecommend the student for anhonors degree. A grade of at least166 FRENCHA- is required for the award of honors in French. INTERNSHIPS In addition to the basic require-ments for the major, students alsohave the opportunity to participatein internships sponsored by theDepartment of French. Recentinternships have been completed atthe French cultural services office,the French music office, and theFrench film office. For more infor-mation, please contact the under-graduate administrative aide.Internships and independent stud-ies do not count toward the Frenchmajor, except with special permis-sion of the department. ACCELERATED B.A./M.A. PROGRAM IN FRENCH ORFRENCH STUDIES The Department of French and the Institute of French Studies offerqualified students the opportunityto earn the B.A. and M.A. degreesin a shortened period of study.While still undergraduates, stu-dents enrolled in the program mayearn up to 12 points toward theM.A. by completing three graduatecourses in the Department ofFrench or at the Institute of FrenchStudies.

As a rule, the seminars are given only in the fall semester. The array of seminars changes from year to year.

Baseball is neither a metaphor forlife nor a perfect explanation forthe uniqueness of American cul-ture or American character. Butsport\u2014and, for some cogent rea-sons, baseball in particular\u2014doesprovide a way to examine majorcontemporary historical questionsin the areas of race, gender, andclass. The Brooklyn Dodgers' pio-neering role in American racialintegration in the years afterWorld War II, for example, andthe Yankees' early failure to followsuit provide useful laboratories fora study of race. The stronglymacho character of baseball revealsbasic gender aspirations and preju-dices more subtly evoked in otherareas of American life. To theextent that baseball is indeed aworking-class game, fan involve-ment reveals much about thenature of urban class values andtensions in the 20th century. Afull-length baseball-related research paper is required. Computer Simulation V50.0207 Peskin. 4 points.

Thetechniques needed to perform suchsimulations are taught in class andthen applied in the laboratory bythe students themselves, who workindividually or in teams on com-puting projects and report on theseprojects to the group as a whole.Students learn how to make thecomputer generate graphics,movies, and sounds as needed forpresentation of the results of thedifferent simulations. Examplesemphasized in class include theorbits of planets, moons, comets,and spacecraft; the spread of dis-eases in a population; the produc-tion of sound by musicalinstruments; and the electrical activity of nerves. Students maydraw their projects from this list orchoose other projects according toindividual interests. Language and Reality in 20th- Century Science and LiteratureV50.0210 Ulfers. 4 points. Explores the possibility that a com-mon ground exists between the so-called two cultures of science andthe humanities. It posits thehypothesis of a correlation betweenpostclassical science (for example,quantum theory) and postmodernliterature and philosophy. Amongthe notions examined areHeisenberg's \"uncertainty principle\"and the \"undecidability\" of decon-structive theory. The discussion ofthese notions, and their implicationsin literary works, revolves aroundtheir effect on classical logic, the ref-erential function of language, andthe traditional goal of a completeexplanation/description of reality.Readings include selections from173 FRESHMAN HONORS SEMINARSthe Borges, Kundera, Pirsig, and Pynchon, and from non-technical texts on quantum andchaos theories. The Supreme Court and the Religion Clauses: Religion andState in AmericaV50.0218 Sexton. 4 points. Should members of the NativeAmerican church be allowed tosmoke peyote at religious cere-monies? Can a public high schoolinvite a rabbi to give a benedictionand convocation at graduation?Should a state legislator rely on hisor her religious convictions informing a view about the legalityof capital punishment or abortion?This course divides these questionsinto three subject areas: religiousliberty, separation of church andstate, and the role of religion inpublic and political life. It focuseson how the Supreme Court hasdealt with these areas and, moreimportant, invites students to con-struct a new vision of the properrelationship among religion, state,and society in a 20th-century lib-eral constitutional democracy. Freedom, Classical Liberal Principles, and 21st-CenturyProblemsV50.0227 Rizzo. 4 points. Introduces students to the princi-ples of classical liberalism throughthe discussion of theoretical andempirical issues in economics, law,and ethics. \"Classical liberalism\" isthe political, economic, social, andmoral philosophy that is severelyskeptical of the power of the stateand seeks to reduce its power overthe citizen. It advances the viewthat society, under the rule of law,is largely self-regulating, and sogovernment intervention, whetherin economic or social affairs, iseither unnecessary or simply makesproblems worse. Sometimes classi-cal liberalism is called \"19th-century liberalism,\" but its devel-opment has roots in ancientRoman thought, the 18th-centuryScottish Enlightenment, and manystrains of 20th-century philosophyand economics. Its leadingthinkers have included AdamSmith, A. Hayek, and MiltonFriedman. The course considersphilosophical principles andempirical issues in the context ofcontemporary problems, such asfree trade, property rights, income distribution, and social-religioustoleration. First Amendment Freedom of ExpressionV50.0235 Solomon. 4 points. Conflicts over freedom of speecherupt into public debate almostevery week. Congress passes a lawto purge indecency from onlinecommunications. A tobacco com-pany sues a major television net-work for libel. Press disclosuresthreaten the fair-trial rights ofdefendants in the Oklahoma Citybombing trial. Although the FirstAmendment appears on its face toprohibit any governmental restric-tions on speech, the SupremeCourt in fact balances free andopen expression against other vitalinterests of society. This coursebegins by examining the struggleagainst seditious libel (the crime ofcriticizing government or its offi-cials) that was not won in thiscountry until the landmark deci-sion in New York Times v. Sullivan in 1964. Students examine free-dom of speech through the prismof a rich variety of contemporaryconflicts, including political dis-sent that advocates overthrow ofthe government, prior restraintsagainst publication, flag burning,obscenity and pornography, thenew law that bans indecency fromonline services, hate speech, andinflictions of emotional distress.Students read and analyze impor-tant decisions of the U.S. SupremeCourt. Performing Homer: The Iliad and the Odyssey V50.0272 Meineck. 4 points. The Iliad and the Odyssey stand as two of the greatest works of worldliterature, and yet these hugelyinfluential texts are actually arecord of a performance event filledwith action and drama and punc-tuated with the visceral energy of alive presentation. It is in the con-text of performance that thiscourse examines the works of theHomeric tradition and their subse-quent influence on drama, litera-ture, and culture. Using Homer'sIliad and Odyssey as central texts, we explore the following ques-tions: Who was Homer? What istruth and what is fiction in thesegreat stories\u2014did the Trojan Waractually happen? Who were the Mycenaeans, and how did themodern world \"discover\" them?Who were the audience of the Iliad and the Odyssey, and what kind of society did they live in? We alsodiscuss the main themes found inHomer, such as war, the code ofthe warrior, religion, the family,politics, and the effects of rage andreconciliation. Finally, this coursetraces the influence of Homer onthe Greek dramatists, the Romanpoets, the literature of theRenaissance, Shakespeare, moderndrama, and contemporary movies. What Makes a Great Leader? Perspectives from Government,Law, and BusinessV50.0275 Yu. 4 points. Machiavelli wrote in 1532, \"Thereis nothing more difficult to take inhand, more perilous to conduct, ormore uncertain in its success, thanto take the lead in the introductionof a new order of things.\" Thisseminar explores some of the waysin which leaders, particularly overthe past two centuries, have arisenin a number of settings. How dowe define greatness in leadership?Have the standards remainedstatic, or have they changed overtime? How have leaders overcomethe obstacles in their paths? What,if any, traits do they have in com-mon? Do leaders make the times inwhich they serve, or do the timesdictate the leaders who emerge?Are leadership skills innate, or canthey be learned and developed?The seminar stimulates thinkingthrough readings and discussionabout notable figures from politicsand government, such as theFounding Fathers, Lincoln,Mandela, Gandhi, and Churchill,while looking at contemporaryexamples drawn from the businessand legal worlds, as well. Readingsinclude selections from biography,analysis and commentary, history,and autobiography. The seminaralso features sessions with promi-nent figures from the business,media, and political worlds, dis-cussing their views and firsthandobservations about leadership. The Biology of Infectious DiseasesV50.0276 Blaser, Ernst. 4 points. Infectious diseases have shapedhuman biology, genes, culture, and174 FRESHMAN HONORS SEMINARSimagination. After the advent of antibiotics, we thought that wecould win the \"war\" on infectiousdiseases. Antibiotic resistance andAIDS, among other events, havetaught us that the war is notwinnable. Rather, we must under-stand our place in the microbialworld, learn to adapt strategiesthat minimize infectious diseaseimpact, and maximize our symbio-sis with indigenous organisms.After introductory discussions, thecourse is conducted as a series ofseminars by students on topics thatprovide greater understanding ofthe underlying biological issues.Topics that may be discussedinclude genetic susceptibility todiseases such as malaria, problemsinvolved in antibiotic resistance,the evolution of HIV , goodmicrobes versus bad, and infectiousdiseases in the postmodern world. From the Rise of Christianity to Bowling Alone : A Sociological Perspective on T wo MillenniaV50.0282 Lehman. 4 points. The new millennium has dawnedwith growing disenchantmentwith traditional left-right cleav-ages and with the claim that theUnited States is increasingly anation of isolated individualistswhose disregard for collectiveresponsibilities is eroding civicvirtues and its democratic institu-tions. This course assesses the tra-jectory of our culture using thedimensions of autonomy versusorder and freedom versus deter-minism. The seminar begins byprobing these diagnoses in thebroader context of moral and socialtransformations in the West overthe last 2,000 years. Studentsexamine social-science analyses ofpivotal changes that have occurredin that period. They consider thesociologist Rodney Stark's highlyacclaimed The Rise of Christianity, which focuses on developmentsduring the first four centuries ofthe first millennium of the com-mon era. The final reading of thecourse is the political scientistRobert Putnam's controversialBowling Alone, a much-publicized critique of contemporary Americancivic life.The Crusades and Their Legacy V50.0296 Claster. 4 points. In the history of the interactionsamong Christianity, Islam, andJudaism, the Crusades, whichbegan at the end of the 11th cen-tury, form one of the most impor-tant chapters, if not themost important chapter. The Crusadesbegan as religious wars to recoverthe holy places venerated byChristians in the city of Jerusalem.For 200 years, the Crusaders man-aged to hold on to their posses-sions, losing more of them withevery passing decade, until at lastthe Muslims triumphed and thekingdom in the East was lost toWestern Christendom. This semi-nar covers the Crusades themselves,but focuses on the relations amongthe three great religions and how itcame about that they all claimJerusalem for their own. We studythe differences among the religions,as well as their many similarities.Most of all, we address some of theproblems crucial to an understand-ing of the world we live in: thenature of a holy war, the issue ofwhether the Crusades were the firstmanifestation of European imperi-alism in the Middle East, and thelegacy of the crusading era.Readings include Muslim, Jewish,and Christian writings of the era,in translation, as well as secondaryworks. Europe in Africa and Africa in Europe: Interaction andRupture in HistoryV50.0303 Lewis. 4 points. Explores pivotal moments of con-frontation and exchange in whichthe course of economic, cultural,and political development in theEuropean and African experiencesare reciprocally and significantlyaltered. The proposition that theaxiom \"others have made us\"applies at the most profound levelsequally to conqueror and con-quered, exploiter and exploited,superordinates and subordinates isto be tested in this seminarthrough an exploration of fiveturning-point interactions: (1) Islam's first European century(the eighth-century Muslim con-quest of Iberia), (2) capitalism and slavery, the 1400s to 1850, (3) African resistance in the scramble for Africa, (4) bohemianParis and Renaissance Harlem, (5) literatures and politics of rup-ture (Wells-Barnett, Du Bois, andMaran to Fanon, Baldwin, and oth-ers; Ghana and the Congo). Fiveessays keyed to the five topics andbased on seminar discussions,required readings, and independ-ent research are to be presentedserially. Memoirs and Diaries in Modern European Jewish HistoryV50.0312 Kaplan. 4 points. Analyzes modern Jewish historythrough the use of memoirs anddiaries, which can offer an abun-dance of detail about the publicpolitical, economic, social, andreligious worlds, and provide valu-able, often rare, glimpses into themotivations and expectations ofJews regarding the non-Jewishworld. Moreover, revealing crucialconcealed thoughts and emotions,as well as attitudes and behaviorswithin the family, friendship net-works, and the Jewish community,they allow students to delve intorelations between parents and chil-dren, spouses, generations, neigh-bors, and friends. The coursebegins with the most famousmemoir written by a Jewishwoman, Glikl of Hameln, in thelate 17th century, and continuesthrough the mid-20th century radical.Readings from the Holocaustperiod include two classics: thediaries of Anne Frank, a younggirl, and Victor Klemperer, an eld-erly Jewish man. Students areresponsible for reading the primarysources, and the instructor includesintroductory materials to place thememoirs in their historical contextin each class. Literary Theory and Its ApplicationsV50.0355 Maynard. 4 points. Students in this seminar read aselection of essays from majorthinkers about literature, mainlyfrom the latter half of the 20th175 FRESHMAN HONORS SEMINARScentury, to learn to consider differ- ent approaches to literature. Theycomplete the course by preparing adiscussion of a work of literatureusing one or more of the concep-tual approaches they have studied.Emphasis is placed on learninghow to analyze theoretical prob-lems and improvise in applyingthem to new situations.Recommended for students inter-ested in any area of the humanities.Liftoff: Covering Space from the Inside OutV50.0381 Burrows. 4 points. Access to space provides humanitywith one of the most importantcapabilities in history. Sendingpeople to orbit Earth and to visitthe Moon has profoundly shapedour view of ourselves and of thelarger world in which we exist.And the exploration of the solarsystem with robots that have sentback a virtual library of informa-tion has increased our understand-ing of the universe to an extentnever before possible. But thespace program is about much more than exploration. It is also aboutthe workaday machines that haverevolutionized weather prediction,communication (notably, cellphones), navigation, land use, andspotting and monitoring climatechange. The course begins with thebasics of rocketry and elementaryastronautics and moves on to howthey are used. The military dimen-sion is included, and also the likelyfuture of humans in space, begin-ning with the establishment of aMoon colony.Gender and Sexuality Studies is administered by the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA), offering a broad interdisciplinary investigation of genderand sexuality as keys to understanding human experience.

It is also a method of thinking characterized byits attention to the contexts in which people have lived and worked. By mas- tering this method of thinking, students of history gain invaluable skills and tech-niques. They learn to analyze and interpret many different kinds of evidence\u2014cultural,social, economic, and political\u2014to organize it into a coherent whole and present itclearly with style in written or oral form. In doing so, students also learn to justify andquestion their own and others' conclusions, for history is always an argument aboutwhat actually happened. Indeed, rethinking and revising accepted historical conclu-sions is one of the most important\u2014and most interesting\u2014tasks of the historian. Notable among the department's areas of scholarly strength are American urban, social, labor, and ethnic history; medieval, early modern, and modern Europeanhistory; and American and European women's history. The sub-Saharan African, LatinAmerican, and Asian areas are also strong and tend to be multidisciplinary. Throughindependent study and the honors program, students find challenging opportunities forspecial concentration and individual research. The internship program enables studentsto engage in special kinds of supervised historical projects for credit. Many of the proj-ects are at cultural institutions in New York and at the United Nations. The University's Elmer Holmes Bobst Library is rich in works of history, and students also may also use the collections of the New York Public Library, the historicalsocieties and museums in New York City, and neighboring universities.DEPARTMENT OF History (57) 53 WASHINGTON SQUARE SOUTH, 7TH FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10012-1098. 212-998-8600. www.history.as.nyu.edu CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Benton DIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES: Professor Diner 198 Emeriti: Remarque Professor of European Studies:Judt Silver Professor; Professor of History and UniversityProfessor:LewisSilver Professors; Professors History:Kupperman, Peirce University Global History of Western Civilization:Europe in the MakingV57.0001 Offered every year. 4 points.The making of Europe, from theclassical period to the beginning ofthe modern era, was a uniquelycreative process.

GRADUATE COURSES OPEN TO UNDERGRADUATES Qualified undergraduates may reg- ister for graduate courses in Italianwith the permission of the directorof graduate studies. A completelist of appropriate graduate coursesis available in the department eachsemester.At New York University, we believe that journalism has a serious public mission and can make a difference. We want to educate those who agree. Opportunitiesabound in the media world, but the opportunity to do compelling work that informs, engages\u2014and matters\u2014is what drives our faculty, motivates our students, andinforms our entire approach. Great journalism has always come from the great cities of theglobe, and there is no better place to learn the craft than the city of New York\u2014wherepower and wealth concentrate, news and culture originate, and daily events fascinate. Centrally located in Manhattan's Greenwich Village, the department immerses students in the richness and vitality of the city, while attracting to campus many of theleaders and thinkers in the journalism profession. New York City is our laboratory\u2014and our inspiration. The very first lesson we offer students is this: Tap into it, with ourhelp. NYU students study as interns in almost every major news organization in thecity. They often graduate to jobs in newspapers, magazines, broadcast outlets, andonline operations headquartered in New York, though some choose to go elsewhere.And every day, students move outward from the classroom to the city, on assignmentsthat take them all over town. The full-time faculty is itself of national stature in the journalism world. As writers, reporters, producers, and critics, NYU professors continue to practice the jour-nalism they teach and preach, holding the profession to its highest standards of publicservice. Course work begins with the basic skills of reporting, writing, and research, butsimultaneously students are taught what journalism at its best can be\u2014and what itshould accomplish in a free and democratic society. They are also encouraged to publishtheir work, with assignments, internships, and online projects geared to this end. Housed within the arts and sciences core of a leading university, the depart- ment sees journalism as an essential strand in the liberal arts tradition and a critical fac-tor in public culture. But we also recognize that news these days is a business. Whenour skilled graduates enter that business, they are prepared to improve and enliven it. Department facilities include four state-of-the-art newsrooms, modern broad- cast production facilities, the Associated Press wire service, and desktop publishing.DEPARTMENT OF Journalism (54) 20 COOPER SQUARE, 6TH FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6636. 212-998-7980. www.journalism.nyu.edu CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Associate Professor Kroeger DIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES: Clinical Associate Professor Ludlum JOURNALISMFacultyCollegiate Professor; Hotz,Johnson, of Adjunct Relations: Quigley Director of Career Services: Noel Head of Undergraduate Advisement and Assessment:Dullahan Program MAJOR The Department offers a B.A. ineither general and investigativereporting (GIR) or media criti-cism.

The goals of the internshipare threefold: (1) to allow studentsto apply the theory they havegained through course work, (2) toprovide students with analyticaltools, and (3) to assist students inexploring professional career paths.The internship is open to juniors and seniors and requires an inter-view and permission of the directorof internships. ELECTIVE COURSES Latino/a Art and Performancein New York CityV18.0532 4 points. Looks at the history of Latino/a artand performance in the context ofNew York City. In particular, stu-dents study Latino/a aesthetic prac-tices within and against thesocial-political environment oftheir enactment. Latinos' role inthe continually redefined realm ofhip-hop, the extensive history ofLatino contributions to the artisticvitality of the Lower East Side, andthe theatrical production of Latino-specific community theatres repre-sent a few of the areas that areexplored. Students consider con-temporary Latino art, and theinstitutions that support it, fromthe perspective of the changingLatino demographic of New YorkCity. Furthermore, students exam-ine and analyze the specific waysthat artists utilize the city as a sitefor artistic possibility. This coursebrings together both an investiga-tion of the aesthetics of Latino per-formance and an investigation ofdemocratic possibilities of urbanspace. In addition to the weeklyseminar meeting, students arerequired to attend several perfor-mances, visit art galleries, and exe-cute a research project profiling aparticular artist or institution.236 LATINO STUDIESLatino/a Popular Culture V18.0534 4 points. Latinos are at the heart of numer-ous genres of popular culture pro-duction: music, film, graphicnovels, performance. This courseexamines contemporary popularculture products by and forLatinos, looking in particular atissues of production, circulation,and consumption. Is popular cul-ture a site of Latino/a culturalexpression, how and in what ways?How is it circulated and con-sumed, how is it mediated by dif-ferent culture industries? What dowe even mean by Latino/a popularculture? These and more questionsare considered through a range ofinterdisciplinary studies. Latino/a Sexualities V18.0536 4 points. Examines the study of sexuality asit pertains to the production andrepresentation of Latino/a identi-ties. Students consider the integralroles scholarship and literatureon/about Latino/a sexuality haveplayed in the history of the broaderU.S. feminist movement, feministtheory, and GLBTQ studies. Thecourse begins with examina-tion of classic Chicana feministtexts and the anthropological studyof Latino sexual practices in lightof their influential interventions toU.S. studies on gender and sexual-ity since the 1980s and early1990s. Students then explore morerecent contributions by Latinoscholars that disrupt the simplisticways in which Latino/a sexualityhas been taken up as an exotic andradical departure from founda-tional work on sexuality. Studentsengage sexuality in its plurality,examining multiple imaginings ofLatino/a sexuality through fiction,performance theory, queer Latino/acritiques, and studies on emergingLatino masculinities. and BeyondV18.0540 Formerly V13.0305. Prerequisite: V18.0501, any intro-ductory course in the social sciences, or aMAP World Cultures course. D\u00e1vila.Offered every year. 4 points.Examines the Latinization of urbanlandscapes in New York City andbeyond. Considers the economicand political factors that have his-torically fueled the immigration ofLatin American peoples to U.S. cities, their incorporation into U.S.society and culture, and the impactof global economic restructuring ofU.S. cities on urban race/ethnicrelations and cultural politics.Other topics include the contesta-tion of space and power in theglobal cities, issues of immigrationand citizenship, and the politics oflanguages. Students also developfieldwork projects geared to discov-ering the history and present-daylandscapes of Latino New York. Topics in Latino Studies V18.0541 4 points. Possible issues, which vary fromsemester to semester, include raceand racism, politics, migration andimmigration, language, assimila-tion, education, labor, citizenship,social movements, and expressiveculture. Interdisciplinary Perspectives on the New ImmigrationV18.0545 Suarez-Orozco. Offered every year. 4 points.For arguably the first time inhuman history, all countries in theworld are deeply involved in themassive movement of people. Thiscourse introduces students to asampling of recent theoreticalwork, in various academic disci-plines, dealing with immigration.It focuses on Latin American,Caribbean, and, to a lesser extent,Asian migration to the UnitedStates and compares the nature ofcurrent immigration scholarship inthe United States to developmentsin other postindustrial settings.The course examines recent dataand theoretical work in a variety offields such as economics, educa-tion, law, policy, psychology, sociocultural anthropology, soci-olinguistics, and sociology. It aimsto introduce students to a sam-pling of recent theoretical work invarious academic disciplines deal-ing with immigration, systemati-cally examining recent research incomparative and interdisciplinaryperspectives with a particular focuson the emerging inter-Americanmigration system. An the comparative Latinidad V18.0557 4 points. Examines the contemporary pro-duction and meanings ofLatino/Hispanic identities in theUnited States. Looks at the spacesand institutions where this iden-tity is produced and contested andexplores how its definition haschanged since it was first felt andthen officially recognized by theU.S. census. Also examines repre-sentations of Latino/a identity inrelation to the very real Latino/apopulations that now make up thelargest \"minority\" in the UnitedStates. For most of the course,explores differences and similari-ties in the politics of Latinidad infour important, yet not exclusive,\"spaces\" involved in the produc-tion and representation ofLatinidad: the culture industries,urban politics, transnationalprocesses, and contemporarypolemics that reach the \"main-stream.\" In other words, thiscourse is designed to theorizeLatinidad, in particular \"fields ofcultural production,\" whether geo-graphic, institutional, or imagi-nary. Discusses students'individual research projects for theremainder of the course. Asks stu-dents to select a particular \"space\"involved in the production ofLatinidad for further study. Caribbean Women Writers V18.0570 4 points. Focuses on texts by Latinas ofCaribbean origin whose workexplores the intersections betweenhistory, gender, nation, and sexual-ity. Analyzing how contemporaryCaribbean-origin literature byLatinas can be read as a manifesta-tion of the complex histories ofcolonialism, military intervention,and political maneuveringsbetween the United States and theCaribbean in the 20th century, thecourse considers the ways in whichthe \"tropicalized\" Latina bodycame to represent an insidious andseductive threat to the U.S. domes-tic landscape. The course addressesquestions such as What are thepolitics behind demeaning,fetishizing, and vilifying Latinas inthe U.S. media? What dowomen of Caribbean origin play inpropagating, preserving, or under-mining U.S. domestic life?Readings include prose, poetry,237 LATINO STUDIESfilm, and music by authors and artists of Cuban, Dominican,Haitian, and Puerto Rican origin,emphasizing the diverse ways inwhich Caribbean-origin Latinasaffect and are affected by theUnited States. This course is basedon students' active participation inclass discussion, weekly responsepapers, presentations, and aresearch paper.

We treat law as a political practicefrom multiple disciplinary stand- points, examining how law and arange of legal institutions embodyand constitute political, cultural,economic, and social forces. Weexamine the mobilization of rights,the use of litigation, and vernacu-lar legal discourse, largely withinthe context of the United States,but with reference to transnational struggles. In the course of doingso, we study the relationshipbetween making social policy andthe use of litigation by socialmovements. Specifically, we studylitigation strategies at the appel-late and trial levels by focusing onthree sociolegal movements: the239 LAW AND SOCIETYcivil rights movement, the women's movement, and classaction tort cases. What are thepolitical dimensions of legal argu-ments and legal remedies for racialand gender discrimination andtoxic torts?

It seeks to determine that which is necessary in human language, that which is possible, and that which is impossi-ble. While linguists work to determine the unique qualities of individual lan- guages, they are constantly searching for linguistic universals\u2014properties whoseexplanatory power reaches across languages. The discipline of linguistics is organizedaround syntax (the principles by which sentences are organized), morphology (the prin-ciples by which words are constructed), semantics (the study of meaning), phonetics(the study of speech sounds), phonology (the sound patterns of language), historical lin-guistics (the ways in which languages change over time), sociolinguistics (the interac-tion of language with society), psycholinguistics, and neurolinguistics (therepresentation of language in the brain). Current research by faculty members extendsacross the field, including topics in the interaction of syntax and semantics, phoneticsand phonology, languages in contact, pidgin and creole languages, urban sociolinguis-tics, and computer analogies of syntactic processes.DEPARTMENT OF Linguistics (61) 726 BROADWAY , 7TH FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10003-9580. 212-998-7950. www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/lingu CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Marantz Affiliated Faculty in Other Departments:Aaronson (Psychology), Buchwald(Speech and Language Pathology and REQUIREMENTS The major consists of nine 4-pointcourses (36 points) in linguistics.These must include the following: 1.

HONORS IN LINGUISTICS The Department of Linguistics, inaccordance with the requirementsfor departmental honors that waspassed by the Faculty of Arts andScience in spring 2005, offers anhonors degree in linguistics. Therequirement for graduation withhonors in linguistics is an honorsthesis of 40 to 50 pages, typicallythe culmination of a year's work,and two advanced courses chosenwith the honors thesis adviser. Admission to the honors pro- gram requires an application in thesecond semester of junior year. Itnormally requires a GPA of 3.65overall, as well as in linguistics,but this requirement can bewaived by the College of Arts andScience director of college honorsin exceptional circumstances bypetition from the director ofundergraduate studies. The application must be made by the first Monday in April to thedirector of undergraduate studies.It consists of a one- to two-pageapplication by the student, specify-ing why the student wants to pur-sue an honors track in linguistics,and specifying in rough form thetopic that the student wishes toinvestigate in the thesis. The stu-dent must also identify a facultymember in linguistics who hasagreed to work with the student. The student will be notified by the beginning of registration forthe next semester about his or heracceptance into the honors pro-gram. If the student is accepted, the faculty member who hasagreed to supervise the student'shonors thesis will become the stu-dent's honors adviser, and the twocourses for honors will be chosenjointly by the student and theadviser. JOINT HONORS The Department of Linguistics offersjoint honors in all programs forwhich it offers joint majors:Language and Mind, Anthropologyand Linguistics, French andLinguistics, German and Linguistics,Italian and Linguistics, and Spanishand Linguistics. For the requirements of joint honors in Anthropology andLinguistics, students should seeProfessor John Singler. For therequirements of Language andMind, students should follow thesame procedure for honors in lin-guistics, except that their proposalshould identify faculty membersfrom two departments in theLanguage and Mind major (linguis-tics, philosophy, and psychology),and these two faculty members willbe co-advisers. The thesis topic,needless to say, should reflect con-tributions to both disciplines. Students interested in pursuing joint honors in linguistics andFrench, German, Italian, orSpanish should consult with thedirector of undergraduate studiesfor linguistics, as well as the otherdepartment, in the second semesterof their junior year. CoursesLanguageV61.0001 Gouskova, is ascience that systematicallyaddresses this puzzle, and it offersa uniquely interesting support forthe answer: both. Language is asocial phenomenon, but humanlanguages share elaborate and spe-cific structural properties. Theconventions of speech communitiesexist, exhibit variation, and changewithin the strict confines of uni-versal grammar, part of our biolog- ical endowment. Universal gram-mar is discovered through thecareful study of the structures ofindividual languages, by cross-linguistic investigations, and theinvestigation of the brain. In thisway, linguistics mediates betweencognitive science and social sci-ence. This course introduces somefundamental properties of thesound system and of the structureand interpretation of words andsentences, set into this context.Introduction to Linguistics V61.0002 Barker, Collins, Gouskova.

Phonological Analysis every spring. 4 points.Introduction to the areaof linguistics that investigates howlanguages organize sounds intohighly constrained systems. Thefundamental questions include thefollowing: What do the sound sys-tems of all languages have in com-mon? How can they differ fromeach other? What is the nature ofphonological processes, and why dothey occur? Students develop ana-lytical skills by solving phonologi-cal problems based on data from awide variety of languages. Grammatical Analysis V61.0013 or permissionof least every fall. 4 points.Considers the nature of grammati-cal rules and the relation betweenthe grammar of a language and itsacquisition by children.

Focuses on thedebate within cognitive science asto whether or not the mind is mod-ular (divided into distinct faculties,such as language, vision, and per-haps others). Discusses the relation-ship of this debate to the debatewithin linguistics as to whether ornot syntax is an autonomous com-ponent of a grammar that feedssemantics, but does not depend onsemantics itself for its functioning.Examines works in cognitive sci-ence about modularity and worksin linguistics that bear on the ques-tion of the autonomy of syntax. Writing Systems of the World V61.0033 Costello. Offered occasion- ally. 4 points.Discusses how various writing sys-tems relate to language and ques-tions whether writing affectslanguage (and if so, how). The fun-damental characteristics of writingare discussed: the communicativepurpose of writing, the applicationof graphical marks on a durablesurface, and the achievement of communication by virtue of themarks' conventional relation tolanguage. The evolution of writingis traced. Students compare thewriting systems that evolved inCentral America, China, Sumer,and Egypt, and their descendants,with respect to their relativeadvantages and disadvantages,from the points of view of acquisi-tion, the representation of lan-guage, and the effectiveachievement of communication. Meaning and Time V61.0034 Offered occasionally. 4 points.We live embedded in the passage oftime and conceive of time as thedimension of change. Our lan-guages typically have various waysto refer to time, to distinguishbetween past and future, todescribe sequences of events, and toset up temporal reasoning patterns.This course deals with the expres-sion of time and tense in differentlanguages, and the linguistic,philosophical, and psychologicalquestions that this investigationraises. Issues include the logic oftime, temporal metaphors, differ-ent kinds of situations, presenta-tion of situations, the semantics oftense, and time, tense, and aspectin narrative discourse.

The Syntax/Semantics Interface: HungarianV61.0037 Prerequisite: V61.0013 or permission of the instructor.V61.0004 is recommended but not required. Szabolcsi. Offered occasionally. 4 points.Hungarian is known as a languagethat wears its semantics on its syn-tactic sleeve. Word order transpar-ently identifies the topic and thefocus of the sentence and disam-biguates the scopes of operatorssuch as \"always,\" \"not,\" and\"everyone.\" This course studiesHungarian from the perspective oftheoretical linguistics and askswhat this language tells us abouthow the syntax/semantics interfaceworks in universal grammar. Itreviews the fundamentals ofHungarian morphology and syntaxand discusses current literature.Not points.Examines the pidginized and cre-olized of the world.Addresses three central questions:(1) how pidgins/creoles (P/Cs)come into being, (2) why P/Cshave the properties they do, and(3) why P/Cs\u2014regardless of thecircumstances of their genesis\u2014246 LINGUISTICSshare so many features. Examines P/Cs vis-\u00e0-vis other types of lan-guages, considers the linguisticand social factors that contributeto the genesis of individual P/Cs,and investigates the linguisticcharacteristics of P/Cs. Geographicfocus is on the Atlantic (creolesfrom the Caribbean and pidginsfrom West Africa), but pidgins/creoles from the Pacific are alsodiscussed. Language in Use V61.0041 Guy. Offered occasionally. 4 points.Living languages in use by a com-munity of speakers are diverse anddynamic. Individuals and groupsof speakers differentiate and iden-tify themselves by the way they uselanguage; people can adapt theirspeech to different listeners insocial settings; speakers developtheir linguistic capabilities as theygrow older. The language as awhole changes across time. Thiscourse examines language not fromthe standpoint of abstract struc-tural description but from the per-spective of how it is actively usedin a speech community. We con-sider theoretical issues, such ashow to model diversity in lan-guage use, and methodologicalissues, such as how to study lan-guage change while it is underway. We study appropriate quanti-tative methods for investigatingvariation across linguistic contexts,speakers, settings, and time. Thiscourse has a strong practical focus;students learn how to plan andconduct their own research on language use. Romance Syntax V61.0042 Prerequisite: V61.0013 or permission of the instructor.

Eachstudent will \"adopt\" an endan-gered language and look into itextensively during the course ofthe semester.Attempts to Model Mind Using ComputersV61.0053 V61.0028, or permissionof the 4 points.We examine the possibility that inthe evolution of human and animalbrains, no selectional pressureexisted for any brain to evolve tounderstand its own principles ofoperation. Brain tissues, and thefunctional capacities correlated withthem, evolved to increase percep-tual, cognitive, and language capac-ities to aid in eluding predators,capturing prey, mate selection, nestbuilding, infant rearing\u2014all novelevolved complexity-yielding sur-vival advantages. We argue advantage correlates with thebrain's ability to introspect andunderstand its own operation. Weexamine novel \"graphically orien-tated\" computer models of self-replicating machines, called cellularautomata by Wolfram (A New Kind of Science) and by Kurzweil, that define \"complexity\" that correlateswith languages, cognition, and per-ception.

It focuses on the history, institu-tions, languages, literatures, thought, faith, art, and music of Europe, the Atlantic, and the Mediterranean world from the collapse of Roman authority to about1700 C.E. It is during this important period\u2014which shaped and transmitted the clas-sical heritage\u2014that the social, artistic, intellectual, and scientific culture of present-dayEurope and the Middle East was formed. The curriculum in medieval and Renaissance studies links undergraduates with NYU's outstanding humanities faculty, with the superb libraries, museums, andcollections in the New York area, and with musical and theatrical performances ofworks from this period that are given regularly in the city. It also enriches students'intellectual and artistic experience in College of Arts and Science programs abroad.Students design their own programs in consultation with the program director and fac-ulty: they thus experience the intimate guidance of a center of excellence within therich offerings of a great university and a vibrant city.PROGRAM IN Medieval and Renaissance Studies (65) 13 UNIVERSITY PLACE, ROOM 219, NEW YORK, NY 10003-4573. 212-998-8698. www.nyu.edu/fas/center/marc DIRECTOR OF THE PROGRAM: RENAISSANCE STUDIESFacultyProfessors (Classics), Claster(History), Hyman (Art History),Ivry (Hebrew P .Johnson (History), Oliva (History),Raymo (English), Roesner History), Eastern and IslamicStudies), Kennedy (Middle Easternand Islamic Studies), Momma(English), Rice (Art History),Rowson (Middle Eastern andIslamic Smith (ArtHistory), (French) Assistant Appuhn Husain (Middle Islamic Studies), Rust(English), Watson (English)258 MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE STUDIESProgram OBJECTIVES The program offers an interdisci- plinary approach to the historiesand cultures of the Middle Agesand the early modern period. It isspecifically designed for studentswishing to work in more than onefield of specialization and todevelop individualized programs ofstudy around their own interestsrather than those of a singledepartmental major. Individualadvisement enables students todevelop a coherent course of studythat suits their needs and interests.Among the fields of specializationfrom which students may draw todevelop their programs are (1) lan-guage and literature: classics, com-parative literature, English,French, Italian, Middle Eastern(Arabic), Hebrew and Judaic, andSpanish and Portuguese, (2) arthistory, (3) history, (4) music, and(5) philosophy and religion. Othermore specialized programs of studymay be designed in consultationwith the director of undergraduatestudies. Available to majors and minors are the Marco Polo Travel Award(granted to an outstanding studenteach year to allow her or him totravel abroad for research), as wellas field prizes for outstanding workin the major. Many majors in the medieval and Renaissance studies programhave gone on to graduate work inmedieval studies, early modernstudies, Celtic studies, archivaland/or museum studies, religiousstudies, history, art history,English, foreign language litera-tures and cultures, and music.Other majors have gone on to pro-fessional schools (medicine, law,management), as well as to careersin business and education. MAJOR Ten courses in medieval andRenaissance studies, of which atleast five must be in a single fieldof concentration; three courses inone or more secondary field(s) of concentration; and at least oneinterdisciplinary seminar. In addi-tion, students are expected to showproficiency through course work orexamination in a classical language(Latin, ancient Greek, Arabic, orHebrew) and in another foreignlanguage appropriate to their fieldof concentration. Students whowork in later periods and for whomknowledge of two modern foreignlanguages is advantageous maypetition the director of undergrad-uate studies to substitute theancient language requirement witha second modern foreign language. MINOR Five courses, of which at least twomust be in a single field of concen-tration, one in each of two otherfields of concentration, and aninterdisciplinary seminar. PROGRAM APPROVAL AND ADVISEMENT The director is happy to discuss with students their general educationaland career aims, as well as the spe-cific opportunities provided by the Program in Medieval andRenaissance Studies. All major andminor programs require the approvalof the director of the program. HONORS PROGRAM To qualify for the honors programin medieval and Renaissance stud-ies, students must maintain at leasta 3.65 cumulative average and a3.65 major average. The honorstrack is a year-long 8-point pro-gram, during the course of whichstudents write and orally defend anhonors thesis. The thesis is anextended research paper written ona topic of the student's choicerelated to his or her course of studyand directed by a faculty adviser.During the fall semester of theirsenior year, students who qualifyfor honors enroll in the SeniorHonors Seminar (V65.0998), a col-loquium for thesis writers; in thespring semester they enroll in Honors Independent Study(V65.0999). The Senior HonorsSeminar guides students throughthe research and writing of the the-sis, covering such areas as choosinga topic, compiling a bibliography,conducting library and Web-basedresearch, properly documentingsources, and developing researchand writing methods for graduate-level study. In Honors IndependentStudy, students complete their the-sis projects under the supervisionof a faculty mentor. Students inter-ested in pursuing the honors pro-gram should consult with thedirector of undergraduate studiesby the second semester of theirjunior year. The requirements of the honors program are as follows: completionor simultaneous completion of themajor's requirements; successfulcompletion of the honors seminar;an honors thesis; and an oral pres-entation on the honors thesis andits bibliography. STUDY ABROAD MARC prepares and encourages itsstudents to complement their workin medieval and Renaissance stud-ies at one of NYU's study abroadprograms in Florence, London,Madrid, Paris, and Prague or atone of the Western Europeanexchange universities. For courseinformation, see \"Cross-ListedCourses,\" below.

Students use New York City and other global metropolitan centers as their laboratoriesfor understanding the processes of urban and regional development, the major institu-tions of urban life, urban social movements, urban cultural dynamics, and the socio-environmental consequences of worldwide urbanization. The program draws on theexpertise of a wide range of urban scholars within SCA and in complementary depart-ments at NYU. In addition, faculty active in the city's government, community, andnonprofit agencies provide a unique resource for understanding the city. The major pro-vides particularly valuable preparation for students interested in law, health, teaching,journalism, social work, architecture, city and regional planning, public policy, publicadministration, nonprofit administration, and community organization. An accelerated B.A./M.P .A. and B.A./M.U.P . arrangement exists with NYU's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.

On the recommenda-tion of the department, the studentis entitled to an honors citation atgraduation. A student wishing toenroll should apply to the directorof undergraduate studies. The three following prizes are awarded every year to students inthe department: the Elaine R.Brody Prize, awarded to an out-standing music major in the juniorclass; the Hanna van Vollenhollen Memorial Prize in Music, pre-sented to an accomplished musicmajor in the senior class; and theIsidore and Helen Sacks MemorialPrize, awarded to an outstandingmusic major or minor who per-forms a recital sponsored by thedepartment. Majors will be givenfirst consideration in years wheremore than one recital is presented.The department may choose not toaward the Sacks prize in a givenyear. In addition, two dedicatedDean's Undergraduate ResearchFunds for music students havebeen generously endowed: theMurray Hidary Scholarship Fundin Music and the Julia C.Schieffelin Scholarship Fund. Awards from these funds are made on a competitive basis andmay be used for travel, recordingprojects, research costs, performancefees, and other expenses incurred in the pursuit of music research,composition, and performance. PERFORMANCE Students pursuing a major orminor in music, and indeed all stu-dents in the College of Arts andScience, are encouraged to partici-pate in musical performance, les-sons, and ensembles. We believethat the joys of making music, thededication and study necessary toperform music, and the collectiveeffort required of ensemble partici-pants constitute an inimitableexperience that should have a cen-tral place in a liberal arts educa-tion. Students can participate inthe Collegium Musicum earlymusic ensemble, the NYUOrchestra administered by theCenter for Music Performance, andmany of the lesson programs andensembles associated with theSteinhardt School of Culture,Education, and HumanDevelopment's Department ofMusic and Performing ArtsProfessions. Students are alsourged to attend concerts of theWashington Square ContemporaryMusic Society. In addition to participation in the various performance ensembles,the department encourages stu-dents to partake vigorously of thecultural life of New York City. Ourstudents are entitled to discountedtickets to the Metropolitan Opera,the New York Philharmonic, con-277 MUSICcerts of the World Music Institute, concerts of the Kalavant Center forIndian Music and Dance, andmany other music-presentingorganizations. We work closelywith and support the activities ofcultural organizations such as the Center for Traditional Music andDance, Music Before 1800, theArchives of Contemporary Music,and AfroPop Worldwide, amongmany others.

GRADUATE COURSES OPEN TO UNDERGRADUATES Qualified undergraduates may reg- ister for graduate courses with thepermission of the instructor and thedirector of undergraduate studies.Neural science is a collection of disciplines unified by a concern for the function of the brain. Experimental approaches in neural science vary from analyses ofmolecular and cellular mechanisms in nerve cells and groups of nerve cells to behavioral and psychological studies of whole organisms. Theoretical tools includemathematical and computational modeling approaches that have proved useful in otherareas of science. Experimental questions include issues related to biophysical and neuro-chemical mechanisms within single nerve cells, functional neural circuits consisting ofsmall numbers of neurons, the behavior of large systems of neurons, and the relation-ship between the activity of elements of the nervous system and the behavior of organ-isms. The Center for Neural Science offers a B.S. degree in neural science.CENTER FOR Neural Science (80) 4 WASHINGTON PLACE, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6621. 212-998-7780. www.cns.nyu.edu DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER: Professor Movshon STUDIES: Associate Professor Reyes NEURAL SCIENCEFacultySilver Professor; Professor of Neural Science and Philosophy:Movshon Henry Lucy Moses Professor of Science andUniversity Professor; Professorof Neural Science one upper-levelcourse in either psychology or biol-ogy are also required.

The four main branches are metaphysics (What is the ultimatenature of reality? What really exists and what is mere appearance?), epistemol- ogy (What, if anything, can be known and how?), logic (What are the principles of cor-rect reasoning?), and ethics (What is moral value? And what moral values should weadopt?). Other, more specific branches of philosophy address questions concerning thenature of art, law, medicine, politics, religion, and the sciences. Everyone tends to have or assume answers to these questions. The aim of the department is to enable students to identify, clarify, and assess these answers, bothancient and modern. Philosophy prepares students for a more reflective life, foradvanced studies in the subject, as well as for professions that emphasize analytic think-ing and argumentation, such as law, business, and programming.DEPARTMENT OF Philosophy (83) 5 WASHINGTON PLACE, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6611. 212-998-8320. www.philosophy.as.nyu.edu CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Schiffer UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES: Professor Richardson 281 PHILOSOPHYFacultyProfessors Emeriti: Abelson, Kamm Silver Professor; Professor of Philosophy and Mathematics:Fine Silver Professor; Professor of Philosophy and Psychology:Block Silver Professors; Professors of Philosophy:Boghossian, FieldUniversity Professor; Professor Global Distinguished Professors:Kis, Parfit, Wright Associated Faculty: Dworkin, Jamieson, Murphy Affiliated Faculty: Mitsis Program MAJOR A major in philosophy requires 104-point courses in the department,with numbers higher thanV83.0009.

INDEPENDENT STUDY A student may sign up for an inde-pendent study course if he or sheobtains the consent of a facultymember who approves the studyproject and agrees to serve asadviser. The student must alsoobtain the approval of either thedepartment chair or the director ofundergraduate studies. The stu-dent may take no more than onesuch course in any given semesterand no more than two such coursesin total, unless granted special per-mission by either the departmentchair or the director of undergrad-uate studies. HONORS PROGRAM Honors in philosophy will beawarded to majors who (1) have anoverall GPA of 3.65 and an averagein philosophy courses of 3.65, and(2) successfully complete the hon-ors program. This program con-sists of the following three courses. (Note: Of these courses, only the first two may be counted towardthe 10 courses required for themajor.) The Junior Honors Proseminar (V83.0200) should be taken in thespring semester of junior year. Thiscourse will play the dual roles ofintroducing students to core read-ings in some of the main areas ofcurrent philosophy, and of givingthem an intensive training in writ-ing philosophy. Admission to thiscourse usually requires a GPA,both overall and in philosophycourses, of at least 3.65, as well asthe permission of the director ofundergraduate studies. The depart-ment will try to make alternativearrangements for students whowish to participate in the honorsprogram but who will be studyingabroad in this semester of theirjunior year. Next, the Senior Honors Seminar (V83. 0201) should be taken in the fall semester of senioryear. Here, students begin todevelop their thesis projects, meet-ing weekly as a group under thedirection of a faculty member, pre-senting and discussing their thesisarguments. Students will alsoselect, and begin to meet sepa-rately with, their individual thesisadvisers\u2014faculty who work in theareas of their thesis projects. Entryto this seminar depends on satis-factory completion of the JuniorHonors Proseminar\u2014or on thespecial approval of the director ofundergraduate studies. It also usu-ally requires a GPA of at least3.65. Finally, Senior Honors Research (V83.0202) should be taken in thespring semester of senior year. Theseminar no longer meets, but eachstudent continues to meet sepa-rately with his/her individual the-sis adviser, producing anddiscussing a series of rough draftsof the thesis. The final versionmust be submitted by a deadlineto be determined, in April. It mustbe approved by the thesis adviser,as well as by a second facultyreader, for honors to be awarded.The student must also finish witha GPA of at least 3.65\u2014and hereno exceptions will be made. Inaddition, the thesis advisers willmeet after the decisions by thereaders have been made and award283 PHILOSOPHYsome students highest or high honors, based on thesis quality andother factors (including GPA inphilosophy courses).COURSE PREREQUISITES The department treats its courseprerequisites seriously.

A detailed curriculum is worked out for each student, with individual attention to progress and career plans. The physics major may participate in internationally recognized research activ- ities carried out by the faculty. Some major areas of specialization include astrophysics,atomic physics, condensed matter physics, and elementary particle physics. In addition to technical physics courses, the department offers general-interest courses intended to broaden the scientific background of nonscience majors.DEPARTMENT OF Physics (85) ANDRE AND BELLA MEYER HALL OF PHYSICS, 4 WASHINGTON PLACE, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6621. 212-998-7700. www.physics.as.nyu.edu CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Grier DIRECTOR STUDIES: Professor Weiner Clinical Associate Professor: Adler Program DEPARTMENTAL OBJECTIVES The Department of Physics offers several programs for majors inphysics, leading to either the Bachelor of Arts or the Bachelor of Science degree. A minor in physics and a minor in astronomy are also offered. The basic B.A. major is par-ticularly well suited to preprofes- sional and other students who,while not planning careers inphysics, would like to have the ben - efits and background of an under - graduate major in physics. The B.A.intensive major is for students whoplan to continue their study of physics in graduate school or who intend to work in physics or relatedfields. The B.S. degree providessome breadth in other sciences. TheB.S. or B.A. may be elected as longas the requirements are satisfied.In a joint program between New York University and Stevens Institute of Technology, a physics major at NYU can be combinedwith an engineering major at Stevens. The five-year program leads to a B.S. degree in physics and a B.E.degree in civil engineering, electricalengineering, or mechanical engineer - ing. For further information, contact Joseph Hemmes, coordinator of theB.S./B.E. program, at the CollegeAdvising Center ,Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 905; 212-998-8130. For students not majoring in physics, the following courses are suitable for single electives, have no prerequisites, and assume no mathe- matical background beyond the highschool level. Of special interest to thenonscience major are the following:Sound and Music (V85.0010), 20th-Century Concepts of Space, T ime, andMatter (V85.0020), The Universe: Its Nature and History (V85.0007), and Origins of Astronomy (V85.0008). The course Observational Astronomy(V85.0013) is also of interest; the pre- requisite is V55.0202 or above, V85.0007 or above, or permission ofthe instructor for nonscience majorsand minors; no prerequisite requiredfor science majors and minors or those automatically satisfying NaturalScience I requirements. Physics is the most highly devel - oped of the natural sciences. For thisreason, it is frequently taken as theexemplar of the scientific method,the model for other quantitative sci - ences. Those trained in physics are found in many occupations. A higher degree opens the possibilityof creative research in industry orteaching and research in collegesand universities. Men and womenwith degrees in physics are287 PHYSICSemployed in various fields of engi- neering. Undergraduate training inphysics is valuable preparation forcareers in medicine and dentistry,computer technology, environmen-tal and earth sciences, communica-tions, and science writing. It is fairlycommon for those planning researchcareers in molecular biology, chemi-cal physics, or astronomy to majorin physics as undergraduates.Because of their physical intuition,ability to develop abstract models,and expertise in quantitative reason-ing, physicists are frequently mem-bers of interdisciplinary groupsengaged in studying problems notdirectly related to physics. SUGGESTED PROGRAMS FOR MAJORS IN PHYSICS The calculus requirement may be satisfied by taking HonorsCalculus I, II (V63.0221,0222) orCalculus I, II, III (V63.0121-0123). Students who take theHonors Calculus sequence begin itin the fall semester of their fresh-man year. Students who completeHonors Calculus I, II are encour-aged to take Linear Algebra(V63.0140) in the fall term of thesecond year. Variations of the fol-lowing programs may be con-structed with the approval of thedirector of undergraduate studies. B.A. PROGRAMS Basic major in physics: Provides maximum flexibility for tailoring aprogram to the needs of a studentwho has a strong interest inanother area in addition to physics.Those wishing to enter physics as aprofession should take the inten-sive major.

The department's honors program provides an opportunity for outstanding students to undertake specialized advanced work and independent research during theirsenior year. Graduates of the Department of Politics have gone on to accept positions with governments, international finance groups, multinational corporations, law firms, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and other institutions. Graduates have alsoattended law school and graduate programs in international affairs, campaign manage-ment, public policy, and political science at highly competitive universities.DEPARTMENT OF Politics (53) 19 WEST FOURTH STREET, 2ND FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10012-1119. 212-998-8500. www.politics.as.nyu.edu CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Beck DIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES: Associate Professor Cohen POLITICSFacultyProfessors Emeriti: Peker Associated Faculty: Forman, Jones, Kersh, Light,Rose, Rubin Program MAJOR The major requires 10 4-pointcourses (40 points) in the depart-ment, chosen in consultation witha departmental adviser and com-pleted with a grade of C or better.At least two of these should bedesignated core courses(V53.0100, V53.0300, V53.0500,and V53.0700).

HONORS PROGRAM For admission to and completionof the department's honors pro-gram, students must have a GPAof 3.65 overall and in the major.292 POLITICSThe deadline for applying to the honors program is March 1 in thespring of the junior year. To be eli-gible for application to the honorsprogram, students must completeor be currently enrolled inQuantitative Methods in PoliticalScience (V53.0800) and at leastone undergraduate seminar, or or 2000-level graduate (G53) course.Admission to the honors programwill permit students to register forSenior Honors I (V53.0950) in thefall of their senior year. In SeniorHonors I, students will prepare aresearch proposal for their thesis,which they will write in thespring of their senior year whiletaking Senior Honors II(V53.0951). The thesis must beapproved by both the instructorteaching Senior Honors II and thesecond reader of the thesis, includ-ing approval of an oral defense.Successful completion of all honorsrequirements permits students tograduate with honors in politics.Detailed information about the program may be obtained at thedepartment. MINOR The minor requires five 4-pointcourses (20 points) in the depart-ment, chosen in consultation withpolitics departmental advisers andcompleted with a grade of C orbetter. A minor program mayreflect a special emphasis in one ofpolitical science's four fields orsubfields. However, no specialemphasis on a particular subfieldis required for the minor, nor is adistinction made on the students'academic record or transcript.Only courses with a V53 numbernot also counted toward anothermajor or minor can be countedtoward the politics minor. PRELAW Although law schools do notrequire any particular major orcourse of study, political science isan especially useful field for stu- dents planning legal study and alater career in law. For this reason,it is not surprising that, over theyears, more law students havemajored in this field than in anyother. The Association ofAmerican Law Schools has sug-gested that among the areas ofimportance in prelegal educationare the study of the politicalorganization of societies, the dem-ocratic processes of Western soci-eties, the freedom of individuals,and the art of peaceful, orderlyadaptation to change. The associa-tion also suggests that studentsdevelop the power to think cre-atively and analytically. We rec-ommend that students interestedin a prelaw course of study choosecourses in consultation with theCollege of Arts and Science prelawadviser (prelaw@nyu.edu) . CoursesUndergraduate Field Seminars Undergraduate field seminars areoffered in each of the fields beloweach year. They are advanced semi-nars for juniors and seniors whoare politics majors. Students musthave completed four courses inpolitics, one of which must be thecore in that subfield, and threeother politics courses.

GRADUATE COURSES OPEN TO UNDERGRADUATES 1000- and 2000-level courses are open to exceptional undergradu-ates with an adequate backgroundin politics. Requires written per-mission of the instructor or, in hisor her absence, the director ofgraduate studies.The Department of Psychology at NYU approaches the study of mind and behavior from many perspectives. Cognitive psychologists focus on perception,memory, attention, language, and thinking. Community psychologists con- sider the broader social context for healthy development and functioning. Social psy-chologists determine how social beliefs, attitudes, and decisions are formed andmaintained. Cognitive neuroscientists study features and functions in the brain as theyrelate to certain mental processes. Developmental psychologists seek to understand fac-tors that affect and influence individuals across various ages. These many perspectivesare reflected in undergraduate course offerings, all of which emphasize the scientificbasis of psychology. In addition to its course offerings, the department encourages advanced under- graduates to become involved with the research of individual faculty through theResearch Experiences and Methods course and the honors program. Highly qualifiedstudents are admitted to the honors program in their sophomore or junior years, takespecial seminars, participate in primary research, and write an honors research thesisunder close faculty supervision. NYU psychology majors graduate with an excellent academic foundation in psychology and are well prepared for graduate study in the field. Graduates are acceptedby top programs throughout the country. Others go on to careers in law, business, medicine, and education.DEPARTMENT OF Psychology (89) 6 WASHINGTON PLACE, ROOM 158, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6634. 212-998-7920. www.psych.nyu.edu CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Tyler ASSOCIATE CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor McElree DIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES: Professor Maloney ADVANCED PLACEMENT IN PSYCHOLOGY AND STATISTICS Entering students who have taken the Advanced Placement (AP)Exam in Psychology may be eligi-ble for advanced standing in thepsychology major. Students whohave received a 5 on the psychologyAP Exam will receive credit for theIntroduction to Psychology courseand can complete the major withthe eight other required courses orthree other required courses for theminor. Students who receive a 4 onthe AP Exam are exempt from tak-ing the Introduction to Psychologycourse but must substitute anotherpsychology course to fulfill therequirements of the major orminor. Entering students who have taken the AP Exam in Statisticsmay also be eligible for a modifica-tion of the standard psychologymajor. Students who have receiveda 5 on the statistics AP Exam willreceive credit for the Statistics forthe Behavioral Sciences course.Students who receive a 4 on thestatistics AP Exam are exemptfrom taking the Statistics for theBehavioral Sciences course butmust substitute another psychol-ogy course to fulfill the require-ments of the major. In addition, selected courses in other departments can be countedtoward the major or minor. A listis available from the Departmentof Psychology's Office of AcademicAffairs. MAJOR Nine 4-point courses constitutethe for the major.The courses are Introduction toPsychology (V89.0001), Statisticsfor the Behavioral Sciences(V89.0010), two courses from CoreA (psychology as a natural science),two courses from Core B (psychol-ogy as a social science), one labora-tory course from Core C, and twoadvanced electives. In order todeclare a major or minor in psy-chology, a grade of C or bettermust be earned in IntroductoryPsychology (V89.0001). Credittoward the major is not given forcourses in the major completedwith a grade of less than C.The curriculum involves a vari- ety of possible sequences of coursesthat proceed from introductory toadvanced. It is best that Introduc-tion to Psychology be taken first,preferably in the freshman year.Statistics should be taken next, as itlays the methodological ground-work for the research to be dis-cussed in the core courses. Statisticsmust be among the first four psy-chology courses taken. Core A andB courses of greatest interest to thestudent should be taken early aspreparation for the relevant Core Claboratory course and advancedelectives that follow. For instance, ifa student expects to do graduatework in the area of perception, thenthe Core A course Perceptionshould be taken in the sophomoreyear, so that Laboratory inPerception and Advanced Seminarin Perception can be taken later. In general, it is advisable that students complete their Core Claboratory course requirementbefore taking advanced courses,preferably by the spring of the junior year. GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS Students interested in graduate training in psychology shouldbecome involved in research.Research Methods and Experience(V89.0999) offers students theopportunity to participate in fac-ulty research, providing studentswith a supervised research experi-ence as well as training in researchpresentation and criticism. Thiscourse is of great assistance to stu-dents in deciding about careerdirections and, because of the directcontact with faculty involved, canresult in a letter of recommenda-tion that graduate schools are likelyto take very seriously. Students who are particularly interested in graduate work inclinical psychology are encouragedto include Personality (V89.0030),Laboratory in AbnormalPsychology among The department providesspecial advisement for studentsinterested in graduate work in clinical areas of psychology andrelated fields. Contact the under-graduate program office for details. If the student plans to pursue a research career (particularly in CoreA areas), in addition to the rele-vant courses in the major, coursesin mathematics, chemistry, biol-ogy, physics, and computer sciencewill be most useful. If a career inbusiness-organizational psychologyis the goal, then in addition OrganizationalPsychology (V89.0062), andLaboratory in OrganizationalPsychology (V89.0038), courses in economics, sociology, and mathematics will be most useful. MINOR Four 4-point courses includingIntroduction to Psychology consti-tute the requirements for theminor. The courses areIntroduction to Psychology(V89.0001), one course from CoreA, one course from Core B, andone advanced elective. In order todeclare a minor in psychology, stu-dents must have earned a grade ofC or better in Introduction toPsychology. Credit toward theminor is not given for courses com-pleted with a grade of less than C. SPECIAL JOINT MAJOR: LANGUAGE AND MIND This major, intended as an intro- duction to cognitive science, isadministered by the Departmentsof Linguistics, Philosophy, andPsychology.

Students study the theories and methods by which religion is analyzed today, including psychological, sociological, anthro- pological, philosophical, historical, legal, and literary approaches. They also approachthe study of \"religion\" as a concept, which has itself been an intellectual object ofinquiry, and has played a key role in the development of the social and human sciences.Second, students learn empirically about religion in different times and places eitherthrough historical or ethnographic study, using textual, visual, and audio sources. Third, approached as lived practices, religions present us with a valuable lens through whichmany realms in social life can be examined: gender and sexuality, race, the nation-state, violence, memory, ethics, emotions, politics, economy, power, art, literature, and media.These realms, in turn, impact upon religions. The Program in Religious Studies isclosely affiliated with the Center for Religion and Media. It should be stressed that theprogram is oriented toward the academic analysis of religious phenomena and does notpromote or endorse either religious belief itself or the views and practices of any partic-ular religious tradition.PROGRAM IN Religious Studies (90) 726 BROADWAY , SUITE 554, NEW YORK, NY 10003-9580. 212-998-3756. www.religiousstudies.as.nyu.edu DIRECTOR OF THE PROGRAM: Associate Professor Pellegrini DIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES: Assistant Taylor, Program MAJOR Each major is required to takeeight 4-point courses (32 points),which must include V90.0001(offered only in the fall semester)and V90.0015 (offered in the falland spring semesters).

Itsfaculty and students work in a broad range of fields, analyzing the social and cultural relationships between individuals, groups, institutions, and governments. Inthe department, a commitment to historical inquiry coexists with applied knowledgeabout such modern developments as intensified urbanization, transnational trade andexchange, and migration of peoples. SCA houses and integrates the activities of six interdisciplinary programs\u2014 Africana Studies, American Studies, Asian/Pacific/American Studies, Gender andSexuality Studies, Latino Studies, and Metropolitan Studies\u2014along with the range ofdegrees and concentrations offered in these programs. In their teaching and research,SCA students and faculty are encouraged to make intersectional links between the areasof interest on which the programs focus. New York City is a crucible for the depart-ment's work, both in its community orientation and its connections to global networks. Study in SCA thus provides excellent background for careers in such fields as community organizing, legal advocacy, nonprofit administration, public policy, andurban and regional planning, among many others. SCA students can elect to major insocial and cultural analysis or to major or minor in one of the following interdiscipli-nary programs within the department: Africana Studies, Asian/Pacific/AmericanStudies, Gender and Sexuality Studies, Latino Studies, or Metropolitan Studies.

ELECTIVE COURSES WITHIN SCA PROGRAMS Please see electives under: Africana Studies (18) American Studies (18)Asian/Pacific/American Studies (18)Gender and Sexuality Studies (18)Latino Studies (18)Metropolitan Studies (18)C.Wright Mills once defined sociology as the intersection of history and biogra- phy. That is, sociology studies the ways that social structures and interactionsshape human experience. Sociologists seek to understand the full range of social institutions and practices, from the dynamics of couples and small groups to theshape of institutions such as the church, occupations, and the family to the functioningof communities, cities, and whole societies. Sociological methods of research are diverse,ranging from the quantitative analysis of large surveys to qualitative approaches, such asin-depth interviewing, participant observation, and historical investigation. The Department of Sociology at NYU reflects the diversity of the discipline. The faculty includes experts in deviance, law, and crime; organizations, occupations,and work; politics, social protest, and social policy; education, inequality, and socialmobility; culture, art, and mass media; urban community and the global city; and sex,gender, and the family. The department encourages students to study issues from a vari-ety of perspectives and to develop a \"sociological imagination\" that enables them toanalyze social arrangements and problems. Whether the goal is to become an informedcitizen or an expert in a special field, the department offers the tools and knowledge tohelp students make sense of the world around them.DEPARTMENT OF Sociology (93) 295 LAFAYETTE STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10012-9605. 212-998-8340. www.sociology.as.nyu.edu CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Conley Students majoring in sociology mustfulfill the following requirements: An introductory course: V93.0001, V93.0002,V93.0003, or V93.0010 Research Methods (V93.0301) Statistics for (V93.0302) Sociological one of theseminars) Three electives from other courses or seminars in sociologyStudents must have grades of C or better in their major courses.

FEDERAL LOANS Subsidized Stafford loans the capital oflending institutions and theadministrative facilities of stateagencies. These loans are made byindependent banks or lendinginstitutions and are generallyinsured by both the state and federal governments. During the first year of under- graduate study, the student mayborrow up to a maximum of$3,500. In subsequent years, theamount is increased to $4,500(sophomores), $5,500 (juniors andseniors), and $8,500 (graduate stu-dents). Within these limits, stu-dents may borrow up to thedifference between the cost of edu-cation, the family contribution,and the total of all financial aidawards. For dependent students,\"family contribution\" is derivedfrom the incomes of the parentsand the student. For graduate stu-dents and independent undergrad-uates, family contribution is basedon the incomes of the student andspouse (if married). The subsidized Stafford Student Loan interest rate for allstudents is fixed at 6.8 percent.Interest does not accrue, however,nor does repayment begin, untilsix months after the borrowerceases to enroll at least half-time. An insurance premium of up to 1 percent, as well as an originationfee of up to 3 percent, may bededucted from the loan funds.Stafford loan disbursements are copayable to NYU and the stu-dent, and funds are applied first toany outstanding balance on thestudent's account. Unsubsidized Stafford Student Loan Program: For independent undergraduate students, gradu-ate/professional degree students,and some dependent undergradu-ate students for whom it is docu-mented that their parents cannotobtain a PLUS loan, the unsubsi-dized federal Stafford Student Loanprovides additional loan eligibilitybeyond any subsidized Staffordamounts. Students must first apply for the regular (subsidized)Stafford program, and if they meeteligibility criteria they will beautomatically considered for theunsubsidized program. Terms andconditions are essentially the sameas for the regular Stafford loan,except the federal government doesnot pay the interest on the unsub-sidized loan while the student is inschool. Students must begin torepay interest and principal 60days after the first loan funds areissued. Payment of the principalmay be deferred if the student isenrolled at least half-time for theperiod of the loan. Also, the inter-est can be \"capitalized\" (added tothe principal) if desired. Freshmen and sophomores may borrow up to $4,000 each year,juniors and seniors up to $5,000each year, and graduate studentsup to $12,000 each year. The totalamount borrowed in any year maynot exceed the cost of educationminus the total family contribu-tion and minus all other financialaid received that year. Stafford loan disbursements are copayable to NYU and the stu-dent, and funds are applied first toany outstanding balance on thestudent's account. Stafford Loan limits: Generally, the total debt a student can haveoutstanding from all Stafford Loanscombined is $23,000 as a depend-ent undergraduate student;$46,000 as an independent student(only $23,000 of this amount maybe in subsidized loans); and$138,500 as a graduate or profes-sional student (only $65,500 ofthis amount may be in subsidized352 TUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AIDloans). The graduate debt limit includes any Stafford Loansreceived for undergraduate study. PLUS Loan Program: The federal PLUS Loan Program enables cred-itworthy parents of dependent stu-dents to borrow up to an amountequal to the cost of educationminus all other financial aid. Noaggregate borrowing limits apply. The annual interest rate is fixed at 8.5 percent. For this rea-son, eligible individuals arestrongly encouraged to choose afederal PLUS loan before applyingfor a private educational loan.Repayment of the PLUS loan typi-cally begins within 60 days afterfunds are disbursed and mayextend up to 10 years.

AdvisementCollege Advising Center: The College Advising Center (SilverCenter, 100 Washington SquareEast, Room 905; 212-998-8130)offers a wide range of services andprograms designed to meet theneeds of a diverse student body.The advisers serve as a basic sourceof information about the degreerequirements, policies, and proce-dures of the College. Students areable to explore career opportuni-ties, as well as secure tutorial sup-port. Academic and career develop- ment workshops are sponsored inorder to assist students in planningacademic programs, choosing amajor, and negotiating registra-tion. In addition, various cocurric-ular educational opportunities,from informal faculty talks to sem-inars and lectures, are arrangedthrough the center. Support pro-grams are available for AfricanAmerican and Latino students,Asian/Pacific American students,international students, undecided students, freshmen, and seniors,among others. A freshman advising program beginning with summer orienta-tion provides individual advisingfor new students entering inSeptember. Each student isassigned an adviser with whom thestudent meets throughout his orher first year to discuss academic aswell as career and other issues.New students also work with peer365 REGISTRATION, ADVISEMENT, AND COUNSELINGadvisers who can provide informa- tion and support during the transi-tion to college. In addition, duringtheir second semester, freshmen arepaired with a faculty mentor whois available to discuss their interestin a particular discipline. There is also an orientation program for entering transfer stu-dents right before the start of eachsemester. Students needing addi-tional assistance may, throughoutthe year, make an individualappointment with any adviser inthe center. Advisers also meet individually with students who want to discussconcerns or questions they may behaving about the University. The advisers serve as a liaison withother offices and can make referralswhen appropriate. The center isthus the best place for students tovisit when they are unsure of whereto go for help.

Bachelor of Science (B.S.) B.S. programs are offered by the following departments of the College: Chemistry,Neural Science, and Physics. For details, see these individual departments. The Collegealso offers jointly with Stevens Institute of Technology a Bachelor of Science/Bachelorof Engineering (B.S./B.E.) program; see under Dual Degree Program in Engineering (with Stevens Institute of Technology) in the Departments and Programs section. Further infor- mation is available in the College Advising Center, Silver Center, 100 WashingtonSquare East, Room 905. The general degree requirements are the same for the B.A. and the B.S., with the exception of the B.S./B.E. To be eligible for the bachelor's degree, students must complete128 points with a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0. Within these points, stu-dents must fulfill the requirements of both a major and the Morse Academic Plan (MAP). The degree requirements to be fulfilled are those in effect during the term of the student's first registration in the College. Registration in another division of NewYork University does not constitute a registration in the College of Arts and Science. Readmitted students must fulfill the requirements as listed in the College of Arts and Science Bulletin published during the year of their readmission, unless their readmission letter states otherwise. In very exceptional cases, a student may petition the Committee on Under- graduate Academic Standards for approval of a change in the requirements as stated inthe bulletin. The petition form may be obtained from the Office of the Associate Deanfor Students, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 909B.Degree Requirements 367 DEGREE REQUIREMENTSConferring of DegreesDegrees are conferred in September, January, and May. Theformal conferring of degrees by thepresident of the University takes place annually at Commencementin May.368 DEGREE REQUIREMENTSThe MinorThe minor requirements are found in the departmental sections of thebulletin. The minor must be com-pleted with a minimum gradepoint average of 2.0. The minor is declared at the office of the spon-soring department or program. Nomore than one minor can be com-pleted outside of the College in order for the credits to counttoward the degree requirement. Regulations Pertaining to Both Major and MinorThe major and minor requirements to be followed are those stated inthe departmental sections of thebulletin in effect during the semes-ter of the student's first registra-tion in the College. No credittoward the major or minor isgranted for grades of C- or lower,although such grades will be com-puted into the grade point average of the major or the minor, as wellas into the overall grade pointaverage. No course to be counted toward the major or minor may betaken on a pass/fail basis. (See\"Pass/Fail Option\" under Academic Policies .)Transfer students from other colleges and universities must havethe written approval of the directorof undergraduate studies to counttransfer courses toward the majoror the minor. Once a student trans-fers to the College, all course workmust be completed at NYU. Time LimitAll requirements for a degree inthe College must be met within aperiod of eight years from the dateof matriculation. For transfer stu-dents and for students who are readmitted to the College, thelength of time is proportionatelyreduced. Transfer credit is notgranted for courses taken more than 10 years before the student'smatriculation in the College. Residence RequirementOnce a student enrolls in the College of Arts and Science (firstyear and/or transfer), all coursework used to satisfy the 128-creditdegree requirement must be com-pleted at NYU. All students mustcomplete their last 32 points whileregistered in the College of Arts and Science. In addition, studentsmust be registered in the Collegeduring the semester immediatelyprior to graduation, unless offi-cially approved for a leave ofabsence in that semester. One-halfof the courses used to complete the major or the minor must be takenin the College. Any transfercourses to be applied toward majoror minor requirements must beapproved by the department.The MajorMajor requirements, varying fromdepartment to department, arespecified in the section devoted tothe course listings of individualdepartments and programs.Generally, a little more than one-third of the total points are earnedin the major concentration. Every student must complete a major with a cumulative gradepoint average in the major of atleast 2.0. One-half of the courses(and in some departments, one-halfof the points) used to complete themajor must be taken in the Collegeof Arts and Science. A student maynot register for courses in themajor outside of NYU. The stu- dent must be accepted as a majorin the department and must reviewhis or her program with a depart-ment adviser each term. DECLARATION OF MAJOR Students go to the office of thedepartment or program in questionto declare a major and have itposted in the Student InformationSystem. Students who have earned64 or more points must declare amajor. Those with fewer than 64points are strongly encouraged todeclare a major as early in theiracademic career as possible.DOUBLE MAJOR Students may take a double (sec-ond) major. The same require-ments, including the maintenanceof a minimum grade point averageof 2.0, apply to the second majoras to the first. In some cases,courses may be applicable to bothmajors. Students must then obtainthe written approval for thecourse(s) from the directors ofundergraduate studies of bothdepartments. The second major isdeclared in the same way as thefirst (see above). Transfer StudentsTransfer students must complete 64 points in the College with acumulative grade point average ofat least 2.0 overall, in the requiredmajor, and in the optional minor.At least one-half of the courses used to complete the major andany minor must be courses offeredby the College. Any transfercourses to be applied toward majoror minor requirements must be approved by the department.Courses in which a grade of C- orlower was obtained are not transferable.Preprofessional, Accelerated, and Specialized Programs 369 PREPROFESSIONAL, ACCELERATED, AND SPECIALIZED PROGRAMSInternshipsOne defining characteristic of the New York University educationalexperience is the opportunity stu-dents have to apply their classroomlearning to real-life experiences in avariety of professional and commu-nity service settings. New YorkCity provides such opportunities inabundance, and the College of Artsand Science and the University takefull advantage of our location in thefinancial, cultural, scientific, andmedia capital of the world. Ouralumni base, for example, encom-passes every conceivable profession,and alumni give generously of theirtime to undergraduate studentsseeking experiential learning. A recent survey by the University's Wasserman Center forCareer Development showed that83 percent of graduating seniors inthe College held a job or internshiprelated to their field of interest dur-ing their undergraduate years.Many different types of opportuni-ties are available to students; someare paid, some involve voluntarismon the part of a student, and somecarry academic credit\u2014and all ofthese can be valuable. For the pur-pose of securing and making themost of such opportunities, stu-dents should consider the followingcriteria as a guide. For further infor-mation, contact the WassermanCenter for Career Development(133 East 13th Street, 2nd Floor;212-998-4730). Career counselorsare available by appointment at theWasserman Center; appointmentsmay also be made through theWasserman Center to meet with aCareer Assistance Program coun-selor in the College offices (100Washington Square East, 9thFloor).PAID INTERNSHIPS These are the most common formof internship. Jobs related to a stu-dent's professional interests pro-vide pay for the work that studentsare doing for the organization.Many companies and organizationsprovide part-time jobs that allowstudents to gain experience and tonetwork in the field, while at thesame time helping to alleviate thefinancial burden of being a collegestudent. (Please note: some for-profit companies ask students tovolunteer, but allow it only if thestudent can earn academic credit.Many of these so-called internshipsdo not relate directly to a student'sacademic work and are not worthyof academic credit in a discipline.In these cases, the company shouldconsider providing compensationfor the work done by a student,thus making it a paid internship.) VOLUNTARY OR COMMUNITY SERVICE Certain organizations encourage students to work on a volunteerbasis in order to gain experienceand to provide needed assistance tothe organization. This type ofarrangement is common, for exam-ple, in government and not-for-profit organizations. Suchinternships are valued, sometimeseven required, for admission tosome professional schools, but theCollege awards no credit for them.CREDIT -BEARING INTERNSHIPS A few departments offer academic internships that directly advance astudent's knowledge in the aca-demic discipline and thus earncourse credit. Such academicinternships must be sponsored byan appropriate faculty memberthrough an academic departmentand normally require close facultysupervision, significant research inaddition to the practical workexperience, a reporting of findings,and a formal assessment of the stu-dent's work. All such internshipsrequire permission of the depart-ment or program, and registrationfor them must be within the regu-lar deadlines. Departments offeringcredit-bearing internships mayrestrict them to declared majors,since those students have the req-uisite background. Internshipcourses can be counted towardsome majors but not toward oth-ers. Students should check relevantWeb sites to learn more about thespecific policies and procedurespertaining to credit-bearinginternships in different depart-ments and programs. INDEPENDENT STUDY In some departments, independentstudy that somehow draws on theactivity or environment of theinternship may be a possibility.Like a credit-bearing internship,independent study requires a pro-posal by the student, careful guid-ance from a faculty member, and abody of work that can be evaluatedfor course credit. 370 PREPROFESSIONAL, ACCELERATED, AND SPECIALIZED PROGRAMSAccelerated and Joint ProgramsEARLY DECISION PRO- GRAM FOR ADMISSION TONEW YORK UNIVERSITYSCHOOL OF MEDICINE Premedical students in the College of Arts and Science may make for-mal application to the School ofMedicine before the regular open-ing date for applications. They will be notified of the School ofMedicine's decision by mid-July. This program is open only to highly qualified, full-time NYUundergraduate students whose firstchoice is the New York UniversitySchool of Medicine. To be eligible,students must have completedapproximately 90 points, as well asboth the sophomore and junioryears in the College, and, at thetime of application, they must bemaking progress toward the satis-factory completion of their degreerequirements. Those who applyunder the early decision plan must commit themselves to attend theNew York University School ofMedicine if they are accepted. Allapplications will be handledthrough the Committee onRecommendations to Schools ofthe Health Professions, with whichstudents should register. B.A./D.D.S. PROGRAM The B.A./D.D.S. program is aseven-year joint program betweenthe College of Arts and Science andthe College of Dentistry at NewYork University. It is designed forstudents who are certain that theywould like to pursue a career indentistry. Admission requirementsinclude a minimum high schoolGPA of 3.5 and combined SATscores of at least 1370. Studentswith a wide variety of intellectualpursuits and curiosity are encour-aged to apply.Students are admitted to the program as incoming freshmen andengage in academic studies andcocurricular activities that willprepare them for the dental schoolcurriculum. They spend the firstthree years of the program at theCollege of Arts and Science, wherethey complete the Morse AcademicPlan, the prehealth requirements,and an abbreviated biology major,for a total of 104 points. Studentsmust maintain a minimum overallGPA of 3.2, as well as a majorGPA of at least 3.4; in addition,grades of B or higher must beearned in all courses required forthe abbreviated biology major.Students are also expected to par-ticipate in the program's cocurricu-lar activities, which are designed toenhance their understanding of thedental profession; these activitiesinclude special lectures, field trips,and cultural functions. Prehealth ProgramThe prehealth program in the College of Arts and Science isdesigned for any student whowishes to undertake preprofes-sional preparation for applicationto medical, dental, veterinary,osteopathic medical, optometry, orpodiatry school. The program ofstudy for a student interested inany of these areas minimallyrequires completion of the follow-ing courses: of Biology General andII I pro-fessional recommendor require additional courses, suchas Biochemistry I (G25.1881). While striving to earn the best grades possible, prehealth studentsmust also keep in mind thatschools of the health professions look at every aspect of a candidate'sbackground when making admis-sion decisions. Therefore, studentsare encouraged to pursue a majorof heartfelt interest, to participatein extracurricular activities of theirchoosing, and to develop intellec-tual pursuits and hobbies outsidetheir schoolwork. Additionally, all prehealth students are verystrongly encouraged to get eitherpaid or volunteer work experiencein the area they would like to follow. The reason for this experience is twofold: students will be able tomake an intelligent decision aboutwhether or not they should pursuethis profession, and admissionscommittees can see that an appli-cant is dedicated enough to findout about a particular professionand that he or she has made anattempt to become aware of bothits positive and its negativeaspects. The College's Preprofessional Center (Silver Center, 100Washington Square East, Room901; 212-998-8160) has an exten-sive evaluation process that enablesthe chair of the Committee onRecommendations to Schools ofthe Health Professions to write aletter of recommendation using information from as many sourcesas possible. Students fill out evalu-ation forms each semester.Additionally, students preparingfor the admissions tests and subse-quent application undergo anextensive interview process duringthe spring semester before applica-tion. Students are encouraged tokeep in touch with the Preprofes-sional Center so that they areinformed about deadlines for theevaluation procedures. Students considering a career in one of the health professions arestrongly urged to discuss this withtheir academic adviser as early aspossible. Being \"premed\" is not amajor, does not affect earning one'sdegree, and is not an irrevocablecommitment should the studentchange his or her mind. ThePreprofessional Center will alsohelp students from other NYUdivisions who wish to follow a pre-health curriculum. Much moredetailed information about theundergraduate experience as a pre-health student, about healthschools, and about the applicationprocess is available in the Prepro-fessional Center. Advisers there canhelp students at every stage oftheir prehealth careers.371 PREPROFESSIONAL, ACCELERATED, AND SPECIALIZED PROGRAMSDuring fall of the third year, students in the B.A./D.D.S. pro-gram take the Dental AdmissionTest and make formal applicationto the College of Dentistry.Students enter the College ofDentistry in fall of the fourth yearand must maintain matriculationin the College of Arts and Scienceduring their first year of dentalschool. For the B.A. degree to beawarded, an official copy of thefirst-year dental school transcriptand a statement from the Collegeof Dentistry indicating promotionto the second year of dental studiesis forwarded to the associate deanfor advising and student services inthe College of Arts and Science's Office of the Dean.

The Collegeendorses the position of theAssociation of American LawSchools that a single \"best\" prepa-ration for law school cannot be rec-ommended. As a result, there is noprescribed prelaw curriculum. PURPOSE OF PRELAW STUDY While the College considers the prescription of particular coursesunwise, it recognizes an essence ofundergraduate instruction itbelieves fundamental to the attain-ment of the legal profession.Courses that require extensivereading, research, and writingshould therefore be undertaken.The College's core curriculum is anexcellent beginning for prelaw stu-dents since it offers a rigorous andmultidisciplinary foundation foradvanced study in the humanities,social sciences, and natural sci-ences. The honors programs offeredby several departments provideopportunities to do extensive writ- ten work during the junior andsenior years. Second, the precisionof methodology and thoughtrequired of students in mathemat-ics, computer science, logic, andthe natural sciences will aid in thedevelopment of analytic skills.Finally, a background in thebehavioral sciences and the human-ities (politics, economics, history,literature, philosophy, anthropol-ogy, and sociology) is suggestedsince each will offer a criticalunderstanding of the human insti-tutions and values with which thelaw deals. ADVISING The services of the PreprofessionalCenter (Silver Center, 100Washington Square East, Room901; 212-998-8160) are availableto students seeking consultation ongeneral course selection, law schoolapplications, and related issues.The office serves as a clearinghousefor the dean's certification,required by a number of lawschools as part of their admissionsprocess.

International Student ExchangesStudents at New York University have the opportunity to studyabroad for a semester or an aca-demic year at outstanding urbanuniversities as part of their NYUeducation. Among the Europeanand British universities participat-ing in the exchange are theUniversities of Amsterdam (theNetherlands), Copenhagen(Denmark), Stockholm (Sweden),Vienna (Austria), and Bonn(Germany); Freie and HumboldtUniversities in Berlin (Germany);the University of Florence and theEuropean University in Florence (Italy); CharlesUniversity (Czech France); University of Madrid(Spain); Trinity College (Dublin,Ireland); and Royal Holloway(England). In Latin America, par-ticipants include PontificalCatholic University of Chile (PUC,Santiago), the NationalAutonomous University of Mexico(UNAM, City), (Note: Ewha's international program iscoed.) NYU students who partici-pate in an exchange remain matric-ulated at NYU, pay NYU tuition,and receive financial aid as if theywere attending classes atWashington Square. Studentsapply for the exchange after con-sulting with their academicadviser. For further information,contact the College of Arts andScience Advising Center, SilverCenter, 100 Washington SquareEast, Room 905, New York, NY10003-6688; 212-998-8130;global.exchanges@nyu.edu.Academic Policies 381 ACADEMIC POLICIESAcademic ProgramThe programs and courses offered at the College of Arts and Scienceare designed for students whoattend classes offered during theday on a full-time basis. A full-time schedule normally consists of16 points per term, or 32 pointsper year, which enables a studentto complete the entire program of128 points in four years. Minimalfull-time status entails completingat least 12 points per term or 24points per year. Students who wishto attend part time should obtainpermission from the Office of theAssociate Dean for Students. Suchstatus will be granted only whenthere is good and sufficient reasonfor part-time study. Failure tocomplete a minimum of 24 pointsper year jeopardizes a student'sfull-time status and his or her eli-gibility to receive financial aid. Students in good academic standing may register for morethan 18 points per term with theapproval and clearance of their aca-demic adviser. Students on aca-demic probation, however, whowish to register for more than 18points per term must obtain theprior approval of the Committeeon Academic Standards, as mustany other student wishing to regis-ter for more than 20 points. Change of program: To make any changes in their program, includingdropping or adding courses given inother divisions of the University,students must access Albert viaNYUHome at home.nyu.edu or file a Change of Program form in theStudent Services Center, 25 West Fourth Street. Adding courses: The deadline for the adding of a course or a sectionis the end of the second week of thesemester. The deadline applies toany course added by a College ofArts and Science student and to anyCollege of Arts and Science courseadded by students from other divi-sions. The adding of any course orsection after the end of the secondweek is generally allowed onlywhen the student is changing levelswithin a discipline\u2014for example,from a French or mathematicscourse to a higher- or lower-levelcourse in the same discipline. Theaddition is permitted only with thewritten approval of both theinstructor and an adviser in theCollege Advising Center. Withdrawing from courses: Students are expected to maintaina full-time program as describedabove. Occasionally, they maywithdraw from a course if, becauseof reasons beyond their control,they cannot continue. Coursesdropped during the first threeweeks of the term will not appearon the transcript. Those droppedfrom the beginning of the fourthweek through the ninth week ofthe term will be recorded with agrade of W . After the ninth week,no one may withdraw from acourse. Students who are ill or havea serious personal problem shouldsee, call, or write to an adviser inthe College Advising Center,College of Arts and Science, New York University, Silver Center, 100Washington Square East, Room905, New York, NY 10003-6688;212-998-8130. Complete withdrawals: Students who wish to withdraw from alltheir courses must make anappointment for an interview withan adviser in the College AdvisingCenter. A student who withdraws offi- cially from all courses in a termmay register for the followingterm. If the student is unable toattend the College during the termfollowing the withdrawal, he or sheshould request a leave of absencefrom an adviser in the CollegeAdvising Center. For more infor-mation, see \"Attendance,\" below. Auditing: Matriculated students in the College may audit (i.e., attendlectures without intending toreceive credit) any course in theCollege with the consent of, andunder the conditions established by,the instructor and the department.Auditors may not preempt spacerequired for registered students.Courses cannot be audited as ameans of satisfying requirements foran incomplete grade or as a meansof changing a previous grade. A student cannot register as an auditor, and audited courses willnot appear on the student's officialtranscript. Special (nondegree) students may not audit courses. AttendanceAlthough the administration of theCollege does not supervise atten-dance of classes, it supports thestandards imposed by instructors. Students who, in the judgmentof the instructor, have not substan- tially met the requirements of thecourse or who have been exces-sively absent may be considered tohave withdrawn unofficially andmay be given the final grade of F. See \"Withdrawing from courses,\"above.382 ACADEMIC POLICIESRELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS AND ATTENDANCE New York University, as a nonsec- tarian institution, adheres to thegeneral policy of including in itsofficial calendar only certain legalholidays. However, it has also longbeen University policy that mem-bers of any religious group may,without penalty, absent themselvesfrom classes when compliance withtheir religious obligations requiresit. In 1988, the University Senateaffirmed this policy and passed aresolution that elaborated on it as follows: 1. Students who anticipate being absent because of any religiousobservance should, wheneverpossible, notify faculty inadvance of such anticipatedabsence. 2. Whenever feasible, examina- tions and assignment deadlinesshould not be scheduled on reli-gious holidays. Any studentabsent from class because of reli-gious beliefs shall not be penal-ized for any class, examination, or assignment deadline missedon that day or days. 3. If examinations or assignment deadlines are scheduled, any stu-dent who is unable to attendclass because of religious beliefsshall be given the opportunityto make up that day or days. 4. No adverse or prejudicial effects shall result to any student whoavails him/herself of the aboveprovisions. Credit CREDIT FOR ADVANCED PLACEMENT EXAMINATIONS The College participates in the Advanced Placement Program ofthe College Entrance ExaminationBoard. Students who have takenAdvanced Placement exams whilein high school should have theEducational Testing Service inPrinceton forward their officialscores to the Office of Undergrad-uate Admissions, 665 Broadway,11th Floor, New York, NY 10012-2339. No credit is given for APtests taken after the completion ofhigh school. In most subjects, ifthe score received is 4 or 5, creditwill be granted. If such credit isgranted, students should notretake that course for credit in theCollege. If they choose to do so,they will automatically lose theAdvanced Placement credit. Formore information, see the\"Advanced Placement Equiva-lencies\" chart in the Admission section of this bulletin. CREDIT FOR COURSES AT THE COLLEGE To receive credit for a course, the student must register beforeattending, meet the requirementsfor attendance, and satisfactorilycomplete all examinations andassignments prescribed by theinstructor. For exceptional stu-dents, most departments also offerindependent study. The Collegedoes not permit students to register as auditors.RESTRICTIONS ON RECEIVING CREDIT A student who has earned credit for a course may repeat it once (a\"W\" obtained on first registrationfor a course does not count in thesecalculations). Students may notrepeat courses in a designatedsequence after taking more-advanced courses; however, thesequencing of courses is deter-mined by the departments.Students with questions regardingthe repetition of courses or coursesequences must consult with theparticular department offering thecourse. When a student repeats acourse, no additional credit will beawarded. Both grades will berecorded, but only the latter willbe computed in the grade pointaverage and have credit awarded.No course can be taken for a grademore than twice. Students shouldbe aware that certain graduateschools, including dental, medical,and law schools, will count bothgrades for a repeated course in theaverage. A limited number of credits may be earned by those in the mil-itary services who take correspon-dence courses in colleges approvedby the United States Armed ForcesInstitute. Students may not be reg-istered at another university at thesame time that they are registeredin the College of Arts and Science.CREDIT FOR COURSES AT OTHER SCHOOLS ANDDIVISIONS OF NEW YORKUNIVERSITY Courses may be taken in the New York University Graduate Schoolof Arts and Science; 1000-levelgraduate courses may be taken asdescribed in the departmental sec-tions of this bulletin, and 2000-level graduate courses may betaken with written approval of theinstructor. If graduate courses areapplied toward the completion ofrequirements for the baccalaureatedegree, no advanced credit isallowed for them in the GraduateSchool of Arts and Science. It is also possible for students to take courses in other undergrad-uate divisions of New YorkUniversity and to have credits forthese courses applied to the degreein the College. Students may take a total of 16 points in other divisions, in addi-tion to any courses for particularminors approved by the College.Transfer students should note thatcredits for non-liberal-arts courses(e.g., business, applied art, speech)taken at another institution countas part of the 16 points. The fol-lowing exception applies: Studentsare permitted to take up to 24points in other divisions to com-plete their program, as prescribed,if they are formally matriculated inone program.383 POLICIESPlease note that restrictions apply. Courses in other divisionsthat duplicate the contents of aCollege of Arts and Science coursedo not count toward the Collegedegree. For details, students mustcheck with an adviser in theCollege Advising Center beforeregistering for any courses in otherdivisions. If a course is notapproved, students will not receivecredit for it. Independent study orinternship courses taken in otherdivisions of the University do notcount toward the College degree. Ifsuch courses are taken at schoolsoutside the University, the credit will not transfer to the College. Also excluded from credit toward the degree are any coursestaken in the School of Continuingand Professional Studies once astudent is registered in theCollege. Credit for Internet and online courses will not be counted towardthe B.A. degree. SUMMER SESSION Once admitted to the College, stu-dents must take all courses here,including those they need or wish to take during the summer.Exceptions are granted only rarelyand only for good academic rea-sons. Requests for a waiver shouldbe made by submitting a petitionto the Academic StandardsCommittee, Silver Center, Room909B. Information about NYU sum- mer course offerings is availableduring the preceding fall andspring terms, as is informationabout dormitory facilities availableto students who usually commute. Examinations and GradesCREDIT FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS Students are allowed to transfer up to 64 credits to the College.Credits based on semester hoursare accepted from other institu-tions at face value and are notaltered when they are transferredinto the College. Quarter hourswill be converted to semester hoursto determine the number of creditstransferable to the College of Artsand Science. Credits based onsemester hours will be transferredat face value to NYU. Non-liberal-arts credits are not always transfer-able. Only credits for course worktaken with a grade of C or betterwill be transferred. Courses takenfor a pass/fail grade will not trans-fer to the College. CREDIT FOR NON-NYU STUDY ABROAD Credits based on semester hours (similar to schools in the UnitedStates) are accepted from institu-tions abroad at face value and arenot altered when the credits trans-fer into the College. Often creditsfrom institutions abroad must beadjusted or converted to corre-spond to the College's require-ments for awarding credits.Approval to participate in a non-NYU study abroad is onlyobtained by completing an aca-demic proposal. The packet ofinformation required to completethe proposal is available at theOffice of the Associate Dean forStudents, Silver Center, 100Washington Square East, Room909B. When students receive approval to participate in a non-NYU program abroad, the coursesthey will take are approved and thenumber of transfer credits theywill receive are specified. FINAL EXAMINATIONS When final examinations aremissed because of illness, a doctor'snote must be presented to theinstructor, who may give a grade ofIncomplete. See below for an out-line of procedures for takingmakeup examinations. MAKEUP EXAMINATIONS As noted under \"Grades,\" below, astudent who cannot take the finalexamination in a course at the reg-ularly scheduled time may begiven the grade of Incomplete. Thestudent must discuss the reasonsfor missing the examination withthe instructor and, in the case ofillness, must submit a doctor's noteto the instructor. The student mustask the instructor to give a gradeof Incomplete. Incompletes are notawarded automatically. The timeand place of any makeup examina-tions are set by the instructor orthe department. Incomplete grades received because of a missed final examina-tion must be removed within thesemester following the one inwhich the Incomplete wasreceived. In the case of studentswho are out of attendance, suchgrades must be removed withinone year after the end of the courseconcerned. A grade of Incompletethat is not removed within this time limit becomes an F and iscomputed in the average.(Regarding the removal ofIncompletes received for missedwork other than final examina-tions, see under \"Grades\" and\"Incompletes,\" below.) GRADES Students may obtain their finalgrades for each semester over thetelephone or on the Web by meansof a personal identification num-ber. The parents or guardian of astudent who is a minor (under 18years of age) may, on a writtenrequest to the Office of theUniversity Registrar, obtain thestudent's grades at any time. The following symbols indicat- ing grades are used: A, B, C, D, P ,F, and W . The following symbolindicates incomplete work: I. Onlygrades of A, B, C, D, or F earnedwhile matriculated in the College,or earned in any of the (courses prefixed by \"A\" or\"V\") while matriculated in New York University,are computed in the average. Thefollowing grades may be awarded:A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+,D, F. In general, A indicates excel-lent work, B indicates good work,C indicates satisfactory work, andD indicates passable work and isthe lowest passing grade. F indi-cates failure. The weights assignedin computing the grade point average are as follows:384 ACADEMIC POLICIESA = 4.0 A- = 3.7B+ = 1.7D+ = 1.3D = 1.0F = 0.0 Computing the grade point average: The grade point average can be obtained by determiningthe total of all grade points earned(quality points) and dividing thatfigure by the total number ofcredit hours completed (qualityhours). For example: A student who has completed 8 points of A (4.0),4 points of B (3.0), and 4 points ofC (2.0) has a grade point average of3.25. This is obtained by adding 8(points of A) x 4.0 (point value ofA), 4 (points of B) x 3.0 (pointvalue of B), and 4 (points of C) x 2.0 (point value of C), which totals52 (the total of all grade pointsearned), and then by dividing 52by 16 (the total number of credithours completed). This gives thegrade point average of 3.25. Once a final grade has been submitted by the instructor andrecorded on the transcript, thefinal grade cannot be changed byturning in additional course work. To appeal an assigned grade, the student should first consultwith the instructor who assignedthe grade to discuss the gradingrequirements for the course andhow the grade was determined. Ifthe student is not satisfied withthe outcome of the discussion andwishes to appeal the grade further,a formal written appeal should besubmitted to the chair and/ordirector of undergraduate studiesin the particular department. Anindependent review of the gradewill be undertaken by the depart-ment. All of the student's workwill be reviewed to clarify how thegrade was determined and toensure the grade is consistent withthe academic guidelines and poli-cies of the department. The deci-sion of the department in mattersrelated to a course grade is final. In the case of a course that has been repeated, only the secondgrade, whether higher or lower, iscomputed into the average. The initial grade, however, remains onthe transcript. The grades for courses taken abroad in one of New YorkUniversity's programs or at one ofthe exchange sites are recorded onthe transcript and are also includedin the grade point average. Thegrades for graduate and profes-sional courses taken at other divi-sions in the University areincluded in the grade point aver-age, provided that permission to enroll is obtained prior to registration for the courses. Not included in the undergrad- uate grade point average are gradesfor the first year of professionalcourses taken by those students inthe three-year accelerated dental,law, or medical programs; gradesfor work done at institutions otherthan New York University (exceptfor exchange sites abroad); andgrades for work done in coursesthat are not prefixed with an \"A\"or a \"V\" while enrolled in anotherdivision of New York University. P: The grade of P (Pass) indicates a passing grade (A, B, C, or D) in acourse taken under the pass/failoption. It is also used to indicatenongraded courses. The grade of Pis not computed in the average.The grade of F under the pass/failoption is computed in the average.For more information and proce-dures obtain the pass/fail option,see the section \"Pass/Fail Option,\"below. W: The grade of W indicates an official withdrawal of the studentfrom a course. Please see \"Changeof program\" and \"Withdrawingfrom courses,\" above, for informa-tion on the regulations and proce-dures for withdrawing officiallyfrom courses. I:The grade of I (Incomplete) is a temporary grade that indicates thatthe student has, for good reason,not completed all of the coursework but that there is the possibil-ity that the student will eventuallypass the course when all of therequirements have been completed.A student must ask the instructorfor a grade of I, present docu-mented evidence of illness or theequivalent, and clarify the remain-ing course requirements with theinstructor. The incomplete grade is not awarded automatically. It is notused when there is no possibilitythat the student will eventuallypass the course. If the course workis not completed after the statutorytime for making up incompleteshas elapsed, the temporary grade ofI shall become an F and will becomputed in the student's gradepoint average. INCOMPLETES All work missed in the fall termmust be made up by the end of thefollowing spring term. All workmissed in the spring term or in asummer session must be made upby the end of the following fallterm. Students who are out ofattendance in the semester follow-ing the one in which the coursewas taken have one year to com-plete the work. Students shouldcontact the College AdvisingCenter for an Extension ofIncomplete Form, which must beapproved by the instructor.Extensions of these time limits arerarely granted. INDEPENDENT STUDY Most departments offer independ-ent study courses for students withexceptional qualifications. In thesecourses, the work is planned specif-ically for each student. Independent study courses allow the student to work inde-pendently with faculty supervisionand counsel. The courses are gener-ally numbered VXX.0997,0998and typically carry variable creditof 2 or 4 points each term. Theyare normally limited to upper-classmajors but may be open to otherwell-qualified students. To registerfor independent study, a studentmust have written approval of thedirector of undergraduate studiesof the department in which thecourse is offered. The result of theindependent study course shouldbe a paper or objective, tangibleevidence of completion of thework. The individual departmentsmay grant credit for not more than8 points of independent study(VXX.0997,0998) for workapproved in advance. In general,students are not permitted to takemore than 12 points of independ-ent study and/or internship, and nomore than 8 points may be taken385 ACADEMIC POLICIESin any one department. Indepen- dent study courses taken in otherdivisions of the University or atother universities do not counttoward the College degree. More specific information can be found under the individualdepartmental descriptions. LEAVE OF ABSENCE General Leave If a student and an adviser agreethat a leave of absence is the bestway to proceed given the student'ssituation, the adviser will assist inthe withdrawal from the semesterand extended time for a leave ofabsence. A student needs to com-plete the Leave of Absence Petitionform, which can be obtained at theCollege Advising Center, SilverCenter, 100 Washington SquareEast, Room 909B.

Because these arereading examinations, studentsshould choose to be tested in thelanguage in which they have goodreading skills. Tests can result either in an exemption from the foreign-language requirement (see\"Foreign Language\" under Morse Academic Plan ) or placement into the appropriate-level course.Placement into a lower-level coursemeans that the student must con-tinue his or her studies of that lan-guage (or begin a new language)until completion of the intermedi-ate level of that language. In somecases, adjustments in placementmay be made during the firstweeks of class. Information on placement test- ing can be obtained from theOffice of Academic Affairs, SilverCenter, 100 Washington SquareEast, Room 908; 212-998-8110.Students who place at a level belowthat which they have completed atanother college will lose transfercredit if they repeat course work atthe College of Arts and Science. Testing exemptions: The profi- ciency/placement test is required ofall entering students with the fol- lowing exceptions: students whowill begin a language they havenot previously studied; studentswhose entire secondary schoolingwas in a language other thanEnglish and other than those lan-guages taught in the College; andforeign students who complete thesequence of required Englishcourses for international students.Students in these categories shouldcontact the College AdvisingCenter to verify that they have satisfied the foreign-languagerequirement.

Academic Standards and DisciplineACADEMIC STANDARDS The Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards reviews stu-dent records throughout the aca-demic year. All of its actions arebased on the grades to date at theend of the term. Academic alert: Students with cumulative grade point averages of2.0 to 2.25 will receive an aca-demic alert letter reflecting thecommittee's specific recommenda-tions for achieving an appropriatestandard for academic performance. Academic probation: Any stu- dent whose record is deemedunsatisfactory will be placed onacademic probation and will be soinformed by letter. A record willbe deemed unsatisfactory if, in anysemester, the cumulative or semes-ter grade point average falls below2.0 or if it fails to show steady andsubstantial progress toward thedegree. Steady and substantialprogress toward the degree entails the completion, with satisfactorygrades, of more than half of thecourses (and points) for which astudent registers in any semester.In addition, it entails satisfactoryprogress in the student's major. Failure to satisfy the conditions of probation will result in furtheracademic sanctions and possiblydismissal from the College. Theconditions usually require that thestudent (a) achieve a grade pointaverage of at least 2.0 during theterm he or she is on probation, (b) not receive any grade below aC or any grade of I, and (c) notwithdraw from any course withoutsecuring the permission of theCommittee on UndergraduateAcademic Standards prior to thewithdrawal. Students on academicprobation are also required to havea special probation interview withan adviser in the College AdvisingCenter in order to receive registra-tion clearance for the next semes- ter. More specific requirementsmay be imposed. The Committee on Under- graduate Academic Standards maysummon students with unsatisfac-tory records to discuss their prob-lems and to determine whetherand under what conditions theymay continue in the College. Inspecial circumstances, the commit-tee may recommend to the deanthat students may be granted orplaced on leave for a period not toexceed two semesters. Students on academic proba- tion may not engage in anyextracurricular activities (exceptfor departmental clubs) and maynot hold office in these clubs with-out the approval of the Committeeon Undergraduate AcademicStandards. Students on academic proba- tion should be aware that they areusually ineligible for financial aid.388 ACADEMIC POLICIESAcademic dismissal: Students who are dismissed from theCollege for poor academic perfor-mance are informed in writing byregistered mail. Students who havepaid tuition for the next term atthe time of dismissal will receive afull refund of tuition and fees. ACADEMIC INTEGRITY Community of the MindThe College is a \"community of themind.\" Its students, faculty, andstaff all share the goal of pursuingtruth through free and open inquiry,and we support one another'sendeavors in this regard. As in anycommunity, membership comeswith certain rights and responsibili-ties. Foremost among these is aca-demic integrity. Cheating on anexam, falsifying data, or havingsomeone else write a paper under-mines others who are \"doing it ontheir own\"; it makes it difficult orimpossible to assess fairly a student'sinterest, aptitude, and achievement;and it diminishes the cheater,depriving him or her of an educa-tion. Most important, academic dis-honesty is a violation of the veryprinciples upon which the academyis founded. Thus, when studentsenter the College, one of the firstthings that they are asked to do is tosign a community compact, recog-nizing these principles of academicintegrity. For this reason also, viola-tions of these principles are treatedwith the utmost seriousness. Procedures and Sanctions The penalty for academic dishon-esty is severe. The following arethe procedures as approved by theFaculty of Arts and Science. 1. If a student cheats on an exami- nation or in laboratory work orengages in plagiarism, appropri-ate disciplinary action should betaken. The department can takethe following actions: a) The faculty member, with the approval of the directorof undergraduate studies(director), may reduce thestudent's grade or give thestudent an F in the course. b) If after lowering the grade or assigning an F the depart-ment believes a more severepenalty (i.e., probation, sus-pension, expulsion) is war-ranted, it can refer the case to the dean or his or her rep-resentative (associate deanfor students) for furtheraction. 2. In all cases of either (a) or (b), the director shall inform thedepartment chair of any actionin writing and send copies ofthis letter to the dean and to thestudent. The letter shall includethe nature of the offense, thepenalty, and the right of the stu-dent to appeal such penalty. Acopy of the letter shall be keptin a confidential chairman's fileand not in the student's depart-mental file. The dean's officecopy shall also be kept in a con-fidential file. (The professorand/or the director is encour-aged to meet with the studentand discuss the nature of theoffense and the action taken.) 3. For cases involving a first offense at New York University,the dean shall send the studentby registered mail a notice thata second offense will result in aone-semester suspension or amore severe penalty. (The stu-dent is also called in to discussthe offense and review the con-sequences of the disciplinaryaction.) 4. For cases involving a second offense, the dean shall proceed asfollows: a) Upon receiving a second director's letter concerning agiven student, the dean shallconvene a three-member adhoc committee, with no mem-ber being from the depart-ment involved, to examine theevidence. This ad hoc com-mittee shall consider if thereare reasonable grounds tobelieve that cheating/plagia-rism has occurred and if so,shall affirm the suspensionpenalty. It shall report its con-clusion to the dean withinthree business days. b) If the committee affirms the suspension, the dean shallsend the student by regis-tered mail the suspensionletter within two businessdays of receiving the report.The letter shall advise thestudent of his or her right toappeal. The student shallhave two business days from the letter's delivery torequest an appeal of the sus-pension as provided inSection 5 (below). The sus-pension shall ordinarily bestayed during the pendencyof appeal. c) If the committee does not affirm the suspension, thereport shall be kept on filefor a one-year period. 5. The student in all cases has the right to appeal to the dean. Inthe event of an appeal, the deanshall elicit a written complaintfrom the faculty member andproceed as described above. DISCIPLINE Students are expected to familiar-ize themselves and to comply withthe rules of conduct, regulations,and established practices of theUniversity and the College of Artsand Science, as stated in the Student Disciplinary Procedures and as out- lined in the chapter \"UniversityPolicies and Procedures\" in theNYU Student's Guide . If pursuant to such rules, regulations, or prac-tices, the withdrawal of a studentis required before the end of theterm for which tuition has beenpaid, a refund will be made accord-ing to the standard schedule forrefunds. Below is a summary of theoffenses for which students may besubject to disciplinary charges bythe Committee on StudentDiscipline: 1. False representation or forgery of academic documents 2. Deliberate destruction, theft, or unauthorized use of laboratorydata, research materials, com-puter resources, or universityproperty 3. Disruption of an academic event4. Actual or threatened violence or harassment Depending on the seriousness of the offense, the following penal-ties may be imposed after a hearingby the Committee on StudentDiscipline: Censure: Written reprimand for violation of a specified regulation,including the possibility of moresevere disciplinary sanction in theevent of a subsequent violation of389 ACADEMIC POLICIESany University regulation within a period of time stated in the letterof reprimand. Disciplinary probation: Suspension of privileges or exclu-sion from participating in extra-curricular University activities asset forth by the Committee onStudent Discipline for a specifiedperiod of time.
