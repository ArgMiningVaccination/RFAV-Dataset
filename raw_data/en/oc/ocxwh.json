Your Medical Record Messaging in MyChart can be a convenient way to get non-urgent medical advice from providers with whom you are a current patient. Messages can be sent at any time and are generally responded to within three business days, depending on volume. If your situation requires immediate attention, please call your provider's office or dial 911 if it is an emergency. Most messages don't involve a cost, but there are some responses that require medical expertise and clinical time to respond, those may be billed by your insurance based on your company's guidelines. - A new issue or symptom requiring medical assessment or referral - Adjusting medications - Chronic disease check-in - Flare-up or change in chronic condition - Request to complete a form - Request for a prescription refill - Request to schedule an appointment - Message that leads your provider to recommend a visit - Follow-up care related to a recent surgery (within the past 90 days) - with exceptions for some surgeries - Update for your doctor when no response is needed - Message that takes only a few minutes to answer What to expect if your message is billed to insurance: If your message is billed to your insurance, you may not be charged at all or you may see a low out-of-pocket cost. The dollar amount a provider bills to insurance is based on the amount of time spent reviewing the medical record and providing advice. Providers may only bill for messages that require 5 minutes or more. Different insurance plans cover different things. Here are a few examples of what you can expect: - Have Medicare? There's no out-of-pocket cost for most people. Some might have a small fee of $3 to $8. If you're a Medicare patient with secondary insurance, you'll owe $0. - Have private insurance? Most insurance providers cover these messages at little to no cost to the patient. If you have a deductible, or this isn't a covered benefit on your plan, you could owe $33 to $50. Reach out to your insurance provider to learn the specific out-of-pocket costs for your plan. With MyChart, you can view most test results as soon as they become available.
