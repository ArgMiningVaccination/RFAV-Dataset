The aim of the new Congenital Heart Disease review is to ensure that services achieve the highest possible quality within the available resources. The available resources are not open -ended and it is the duty of the NHS to ensure both that it lives within its means and that it achieves the m aximum value for every pound it spends. 2. New standards for congenital heart disease services are proposed for consultation. These will ensure consistent best practice across all providers in terms of how services should be organised and delivered but do not introduce new clinical interventions or change the threshold for treatment. 3. A detailed finance assessment has been prepared to understand the potential financial impact of the new standards on NHS England as the lead commissioner. Some consideration has also been given to provider impact, but this will be tested during consultation, and is in any case dependent on decisions about the implementation of the standards that will be taken in the future once the standards have been agreed. 4. In summary our assessment finds that CHD activity is expected to rise. We expect that the affordability challenge for commissioners will be in meeting the costs of overall growth, and that the additional costs of the standards should be affordable for providers within tariff income particularly given growth in activity. The costs to providers should be met by the additional funding they receive as activity levels increase, without causing the current tariff price paid per unit of activity to rise. Activity 5. If recent trends continue it is expected that, whether or not new standards are introduced, activity will increase and, therefore, spending by commissioners, and thus income to hospitals, can be expected to increase. The graph below shows possible scenarios for future acti vity growth for paediatric cardiac and ACHD specialist inpatient care; Scenario A takes account of population growth only, Scenario B considers population growth and allows activity per head to increase as it has in the past. 6. This suggests that we should plan for between 0.4% and 1% more activity in children's CHD services and between 0.7% and 4% more activity in adult CHD services each year. The cumulative effect of this increase in activity is important to note. Using these levels would mean that by 2025 there would be an increase in activity between 5% and 14% in children's cardiac services and 10% and 67% in adult CHD services. 7 New Congenital Heart Disease Review 2 Current Spend 7. Current spend (based on SUS data for 2012/13, the most recent year available) on CHD services for both adults and children is estimated to be \u00a3110m. This estimate relies on a number of assumptions, but is based on the best data available, and is considered fit for purpose in assessing the likely financial impact of the proposed service standards. Future Spend (Do Nothing) 8. Based on the activity modelling described above and the estimate of current spend, we forecast that in 2025/26 expenditure on CHD services will be between \u00a3117m and \u00a3140m depending on assumptions about growth. 9. By 2025/26 it is therefore expected that additional funding within a range of \u00a37m to \u00a330m will need to be made available to commission CHD services to meet increased activity levels based on current configuration of providers. Future Spend (New specification) 10. We consider that the cost pressure for commissioners, arising from the standards, will not be materially different from those arising under the 'do nothing' scenario. This is for two main reasons: 11. Firstly, there is already a service specification for paediatric cardiac services which sets similar standards. Many of the costs associated with full implementation of the new standards are already inherent in the existing paediatric service specification, and some providers are already delivering them, therefore these standards are expected to be deliverable within the current tariff, and cannot be considered a new cost for commissioners. This includes many aspects of staffing (including additional congenital surgeons, paediatric cardiologists, paediatric nurse specialists and nurse educators) and the costs of establishing and running formal networks. 12. Secondly, for the majority of these services hospitals are paid by commissioners using the national tariff. Within this price is some funding for investment in services. Therefore as activity rises more funding becomes available for further investment. The new standards set out how this money should be spent rather than requiring specific funding of their own. We expect the costs of providing the service to the new standards to be met from this additional funding hospitals receive as activity levels increase, without causing the current price paid per unit of activity (tariff) to rise. This applies even for 010002000300040005000600070008000900010000 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 activityB A B A 8 New Congenital Heart Disease Review 3 those standards that are entirely new, for example the cost to providers of psychologists and adult specialist nurses. While these costs are material (at national level if not necessarily for individual providers who may already be meeting them) our estimates show that they would be covered by the additional income accrued by providers as a result of delivering increasing levels of activity. Impact on patients and carers 13. The implementation of the new standards is not expected to result in new expenditure by either patients or their carers, and in some areas the standards should mitigate current expenditure. Any impacts arising from changes to services will be considered in a full assessment when implementation options have been developed. Impact on providers 14. We estimate that the additional costs of the standard itself will be affordable for providers within tariff income given the estimated growth in activity under all scenarios modelled. It should be noted that the greatest increase in activity is expected in ACHD, that part of the specification which includes most wholly new standards, bringing the greatest increase in income. The projected increase in activity will provide an additional contribution to semi -fixed costs and overheads built into the current national tariffs. These funds could be directed in a way so as to meet the costs of the new standards. 15. Consideration of the impact on individual providers is not within the scope of this assessment. However, it is noted that the affordability position for any individual provider may differ from national affordability and provider differences such as number of procedures undertaken at individual centres will have an impact on their efficiency and affordability, and thus the overall cos t of these services. 16. The standards include detailed expected implementation timescales set by the Clinical Reference Group. These recognise that some aspects of implementation cannot be achieved instantly. Timescales range from immediate to three years. As a result any cost impact on providers will be spread over a number of years. 17. In some cases there may be one- off costs associated with meeting the standards, particularly where providers need to consider how to achieve the interdependency standards. These costs will vary between providers. Estimating these costs is beyond the scope of this assessment. It is assumed that if the costs are uneconomical the provider will choose to not make the change and this will have an impact on future service provision and configuration. These consequences are outside the scope of this assessment, but will be considered when we assess implementation options. 18. We will use consultation as an opportunity to test with providers our understanding of the financial impact and t he proposed timescale for implementation. Benefits 19. In considering whether any increased costs represent good value it is important to consider what benefits come from the higher spending. Introducing the standards ensures that the NHS delivers higher quality and not just more activity. There will be wide- ranging benefits for patients, their families, NHS England and other commissioners, and also to provider organisations. These are summarised below: The new standards will reduce variation and improve qual ity of care . The standards will be clear, defined and credible enabling commissioners to take action where they are not being met . 9 New Congenital Heart Disease Review 4 Occasional practice will be eliminated thereby addressing an obvious risk to patient safety . Providers will have clarity about the requirements of them, and after 14 years of service review this will enable them to plan for the future and direct investment appropriately . Relationships between providers will be improved by working as part of formal managed networks and will enable shared learning and peer review . Patients and their families will know what they should expect from their service providers and be empowered to raise questions where they feel this is not being met and/or to exercise patient choice. 20. As a result of reduced variation and improved quality of care from adopting the new standards we expect: improvements in health outcomes and patient experience; patients, their families and the public will be assured that the care they receive will be of a consistently high quality wherever they live in England; commissioners will be assured of the quality of care and that additional expenditure for increased activity will be directed to services of increasing quality and not just quantity; and providers will reduce their risk of litigation, se e fewer complaints and resource- consuming investigations . Conclusion 21. The proposed quality standards of care for CHD services will improve the quality of patient outcomes and patient and carer experience. They will ensure consistent best practice across all providers in terms of how services should be organised and delivered but do not introduce new clinical interventions or change the threshold for treatment. 22. Demand and activity is projected to increase to 2025/26 whether or not the new quality standards are implemented. The actual rate of increase will reflect population growth and potentially would exceed this should the recent trend interventions continue. 23. Commissioner spending will need to increase to meet the additional demand and activity. 24. Many of the costs of providing services to the standards are already within tariff funding because they are already included in the existing paediatric cardiac services specification. 25. Some additional costs will impact on providers to meet the requirement for the appropriate number of surgeons, specialist CHD nurses and psychologists. The additional activity and consequential commissioner spending will increase the income of providers and this is likely to cover, on average, the costs of th e wholly new aspects of the standards for providers. Recommendation 26. The approval for the consultation process for the new standards should proceed to the next stage as we do not expect the proposed standards would require material extra funding beyond that needed in the 'Do Nothing' scenario given current tariff and the projected increase in activity for both paediatric and adult CHD service. 10 New Congenital Heart Disease Review 5 Introduction 27. New standards for congenital heart disease services are proposed for consultation. These will ensure consistent best practice across all providers in terms of how services should be organised and delivered but do not introduce new clinical interventions or change the threshold for treatment. 28. In some areas of provider service delivery, additional costs will arise and these will be an additional cost to the NHS as a whole. Principally, these will relate to additional staff and an estimate of the costs of these has been made in order to gauge the relative magnitude and importance of these in relation to the overall service funding. 29. If recent trends continue i t is expected that, whether or not new standards are introduced, activity will increase and therefore spending by Specialised Commissioning wi ll need to increase accordingly. 30. Therefore : The affordability challenge for commissioners will be in meeting the costs of overall growth. The additional costs of the standard itself should be affordable for providers within tariff income particularly give n growth in activity. 31. Some providers are currently delivering services to these standards within current tariff and therefore we are consulting on the basis that providing services in line with the proposed standards will not increase the tariff price paid by commissioners. We will seek a provider response on whether this assumption is viable. If providers consider that this cannot be done then we have to reflect this and we are therefore contingent on that response. 32. At this stage in the review, the purpose of this finance assessment is to consider how the proposals described in the main part of the consultation document could be funded, to help inform the responses from the consultees. Post -consultation, once a final set of standards have been agreed and recommended the implementation of them will be further considered and the preparation of a more detailed financial Business Case will be appropriate. 33. Costs and affordability relating to any individual provider will depend on how the final agreed standards are implement ed, for which there may be many options. These options for service patterns and delivery are numerous and have not yet been developed therefore we cannot assess the impact at this stage. There is no expectation of a \"Big Bang\" approach. The implementation trajectory will reflect commissioners ' plans and affordability will be managed within the context of NHS financial planning frameworks. 34. The approach taken in this assessment is to consider the current and projected costs that are likely to be required from Specialis ed Commissioning budgets to meet expected demands using current tariff prices and future activity projections . Future changes in tariff prices reflecting wider system approaches to inflationary and other cost pressures as well as efficiency improvements have been excluded. For reasons stated above, t he consideration of the net impact on providers is not within t he scope of this assessment. 35. A significant proportion of these services are paid for via National Tariff . The National T ariff paid to providers covers both variable and fixed costs. For the purposes of this analysis, we have assumed that there will be economies of scale in the provision of this service and therefore an increase in activity will increase the contribution to the fixed overheads of the provider, which will not increase at 11 New Congenital Heart Disease Review 6 the same rate. An increase in activity will therefore provide an additional source of funds for providers to invest in the resources required to meet the standards set out in this consultation. The sufficiency of this funding will depend on the amount of additional activity, the proportion of the tariff consumed by variable costs and the level of investment required to meet the standards. 36. Consideration of the impact on individual providers is not within the scope of this assessment . However , it is noted that t he affordability position for any individual provider may differ from national affordability and provider differences such as number of procedures undertaken at individual centres will have an impact on their efficiency and affordability, and thus the overall cost of these services . Current CHD Commissioning Spend 37. The start point for an assessment of future activity and spend is the current estimated level of both . Establishing this has been hampered by a lack of nationally available data and consistency in the identification by commissioners and providers of the relevant activity and associated cost to commissio ners. 38. The base period chosen is 2012/13 as this is the most recent full year for Secondary Uses Service (SUS) data is available. 39. The best information available to NHS England on total paediatric cardiac and adult congenital heart disease specialised activity and spend is that identified through SUS. NHS England is working on improved data flows in this area but this data represents the best estimate currently available. It is important to note that these estimates will underestimate total activity and spend on these services as they do not include spend on t he following: high -cost devices (e.g. pacemakers), critical care (e.g. paediatric intensive care), any activity paid for by local prices, and adult CHD outpatient activity. There are also a number of caveats around the quality of the data that is included: Coverage: The Identification Rules (IR) are used to identify specialised activity within SUS data. However, not all specialised activity can be flagged by the IR, owing to a significant amount that either doesn't flow through SUS or requires cross -refere ncing with a range of external datasets (to which NHS England has extremely limited access). Source: Any SUS data underpinning this analysis has been sour ced from the National Tariff -Mart extract, provided by the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC). This data is freeze data and may contain provider errors that have not been corrected during the reconciliation period. Any coding errors in provider -submitted fields and inconsistencies will remain. Data Enhancements : The NHS England Analytical Service has enhanced the SUS data to maximise quality and the amount of specialised activity identified. While improving the value of intelligence produced, these enhancements will result in difficulties reconciling the data back to national SUS extracts or local activity data processed by Data Services for Commissioners Regional Offices. Modifications have been applied to the IR to maximise the amount of activity that can be identified and designated as specialised, however these do not account for local deviations in the IR. The data has also been subjected to a light deduplicated algorithm, which removes a limited amount of erroneous data. 40. The SUS data for 2012/13 covers all spells for both procedural and non- procedural based CHD activity that have been paid via national tariff. For paediatric activity the data shows the figures for outpatient and inpatient episodes. However for adult activity, outpatient episodes for congenital heart disease are not separately identifiable from outpatient activity for other cardiac conditions. Therefore, 12 New Congenital Heart Disease Review 7 to provide an estimate of the activity , and thus commissioner expenditure, the following assumption has been used: The Paediatric activity information indicates that there are approximately 9 outpatient attendances for ev ery inpatient spell. To reflect the fact that Adults are likely to have a lower incidence rate of attendances, we have assumed that the outpatient/inpatient ratios will be half the Paediatric rate , i.e. 4.5 a ttendances per inpatient spell. This translates to an estimate of 24,900 adult outpatient attendances. An average cost of \u00a3150 per attendance has been applied being 66% of the Paediatric cost. 41. An alternative population- based approach, following a long term condition model, is not possible as the number of adult patients in such a cohort cannot be identified from the data available. 42. The total National Tariff activity in 2012- 13 has been summarised as : Outpatient Inpati ent Other (e.g. critical care) Paediatric cardiac 91,500 10,800 No national data Adult congenital heart diseases 24,90 0 (assumption) 5,500 No national data Note: figures rounded to nearest hundred. 43. The total National Tariff spend in 2012- 13 has been summarised as: \u00a3m Outpatient Inpatient Other (e.g. critical care) Paediatric Cardiac 20.5 62.1 No national data Adult congenital heart disease 3.7 24.0 No national data Total 24.2 86.1 No national data Note: this baseline underestimates total spend on CHD services so as a result the increases in funding required may be higher than suggested above. 44. The costs to providers are not directly available. H owever , the National Tariffs are based on the full cost of providing their services including a share of all the overheads of the relevant organisation. The National Tariff should therefore reasonably represent the average costs incurred by providers. 45. From the limited information available it is clear that the current quality standards , as required by the existing paediatric CHD service specification have not been uniformly implemented by all providers. Where this is the case, providers may need to invest in staff and other resources in order to meet those elements of the standards that are defined by the resources required for a service, as opposed to those defined by outputs/outcomes. Providers cannot expect any additional incom e in the short term as the National Tariff is intended to reflect the current standards. The costs of compliance with existing standards would not be attributable to the proposed new service specification and standards. Costs associated with the proposals 46. Recurrent costs: The principal costs associated with achieving the proposed quality standards arise from increased levels of staffing and from establishing networks. 47. Many of these costs are already inherent in the existing paediatric service specification, and some providers already delivering them, therefore the associated are expected to be deliverable within the current tariff. This includes : 13 New Congenital Heart Disease Review 8 Staffing: additional congenital surgeons, paediatric cardiologists, paediatric nurse specialists and nurse educators. Networks : most costs including lead clinicians, lead nurses, network meetings etc. 48. However, there may be some costs where not all providers are meeting current standards or the new standards introduce wholly new costs. 49. The principal additional cost to providers is the investment in increasing the number of surgeons and their medical teams to meet the standard of four surgeons per rota . 50. It is not possible to provide an exact estimate of the number of additional surgeons required. The number of surgeons at each individual provider would vary according to activity demands. Operative activity levels also vary considerably between surgeons. There may be changes in the way services are delivered that affects the number of surgeons required. However , based on the current configuration of services the requirement would mean teams of four surgeons at each of the ten specialist surgical centres that currently account for around 80% of paediatric and adult specialist inpatient activity. The IRP reported that in October 2012 there were 34 surgeons practising in England at these 10 centres, with a maximum of four surgeons at each centre at that time. This would therefore require an increase of six further surgeons. We have used a working assumption that the estimated cost of an additional consultant (together with their associated supporting staff) to be \u00a3500k (See Annex B ) for the purposes of business planning, or \u00a33m (\u00a3500k*6 additional surgeons) in this instance. 51. As has already been noted elsewhere, given the projected rise in activity levels, it can be assumed that additional staff will be needed and that the associated costs to providers would be met by the rise in income recovered by providers as a result of this higher activity (see 'Future levels of activity and expenditure' from paragraph 59 onwards). The way in which the standards have been written means that the number of surgeons is expected to rise only in line with rises in activity levels. Additional surgeons who were unable to meet the minimum activity levels required would not be supported. 52. Some of the costs of the proposed new standards are wholly new. This includes: Psychologists Adult CHD ( ACHD) specialist nurses 53. Detailed costs have not been prepared because of the absence of an accurate baseline for comparison. It is known however that there is variation across providers in existing staffing levels . Commissioners would argue that : the increase in expenditure required by providers is modest in the context of overall spend; that this standard lifts all providers to the same levels of staffing achieved by the best ; and, that any additional costs should be covered by providers as a result of higher activity levels (see 'Future levels of activity and expenditure' from paragraph 59 onwards ). 54. For example, one of the new standards requires ACHD centres to have 4 specialist nurses. So the minimum additional staff for a provider is zero (if they already have four) or 4 (if they have none). Therefore , as an example, if we assume on average each provider may require 2 additional nurses at an annual cost of approx. \u00a344,000 each , this would result in additional costs of 20 (2 at each of 10 centres ) * \u00a344,000 = \u00a388 0,000 (national cost to the system). 55. Further, another new standard requires Surgical Centres to employ a minimum of 1 WTE practitioner psychologist per 400 patients undergoing cardiac surgery each year . The costs of a further 20 14 New Congenital Heart Disease Review 9 Psychologists at approx. \u00a343,000 each, would result in additional annual costs of \u00a3860,000 (national cost to the system) . Source of costs: Nurse data - uses Band 6 data for specialists, based on banding information from NHS Career s Psychologists - Qualified Allied Health Professionals 56. The implementation of the new standards is not expected to result in new expenditure by either patients or their carers under the current configuration of services. As previously stated any impacts arising from changes to services will be considered in a full assessment when implementation options have been developed. 57. One- off costs: Co-location of paediatric services : cost s of ensuring paediatric CHD service is on the same site as other paedi atric specialities - there are three centres where this is not currently the case and costs of meeting this requirement could be significant. 58. The costs associated with meeting this standard will vary depending on provider and what the barriers to this co- location have been in the past. As a result we have not been able to estimate this cost and will seek a response from providers during consultation. Future levels of activity and expenditure Future projections of activity 59. Based on evidence from data analysis, academic literature and speaking to clinicians, it is expected that the main drivers of CHD activity have been and will be: a. Population growth (which is a function of birth rat e, migration and life expectancy) b. Increase in the proportion of patients who are of Asian and Black ethnicity for whom CHD is more likely to occur and in whom more serious manifestations of CHD are more common c. Advances in medical techniques and new technology d. Increased patient longevity and survival e. Increased complexity and severity of patients considered for treatment (possibly also driven itself by 2, 3, 4 and 5 above) 60. We have used Hospital Episode Statistics ( HES) data for the activity modelling, and this has been triangulated with data from the congenital audit run by the National Institute of Cardiovascular Outcomes Research (NICOR) where possible. This approach has been used fo r the following reasons: HES data is available for both Paediatric and Adult CHD, whereas NICOR's data on adults activity is incomplete. The Identification Rule (IR) definitions can be applied to HES, particularly for adults, and it is this definition that is used to calculate payments for specialised services through the National Tariff system and that will drive future levels of Specialis ed Commissioning funding. As with all HES data there is a risk that providers do not code activity in a consistent manner, though in this instance this is not considered to pose a significant threat to the validity of the data when considered at a national level . 15 New Congenital Heart Disease Review 10 61. Detailed analysis of historic trends in specialist inpatient activity for paediatric cardiac and adult CHD services (i.e. procedure -based activity; surgery and catheter interventions) has been used to identify a pattern of growth. This financial assessment considers all CHD activity which includes non- procedural based activity as well as activity which includes a surgical or catheter procedure, e .g. critical care, diagnostic tests and outpatient appointments . We have assumed that the relationship between specialist inpatient activity and all other CHD activity will remain stable and therefore the growth rates for all activity will follow the trend identified for specialist inpatient activity. 62. We have carried out scenario modelling based on Office of National Statistics ( ONS ) population projections and historic trends in activity per head of the patient population (see Annex C for details). This suggests that up to 2025: 63. Paediatric cardiac activity: 0. 4% to 1 % per annum up to 2025/6 . Could be expected to grow by 0. 4% per annum as a result of Population growth. Up to a further 0.6% per annum could be expected to arise from increasing activity per Head of Population. To note: These figures are very sensitive to ONS birth rate projections which have been previously underestimated. Therefore as a sensitivity we have considered ONS high projections. Under these we would be looking at 1% per annum as a result of p opulation changes and up to a further 1% per annum could be expected to arise from increasing activity per Head of Population - giving a range of between 1% and 2% pa. This sensitivity is considered below in scenarios 1b and 2b. 64. Adult cong enital activity increase will be between 0.7% and 4% per annum up to 2025/6. ACHD activity could be expected to grow by 0.7% annum as a result of Population growth. Up to a further 3. 3% per annum could be expected to arise from increasing activity rates per Head of Population. 65. Assumptions: Population will grow as per ONS's 2012- based principal population projections (Scenario 1 and 2). Activity per head will continue to grow as it has in the past following a linear trend (Scenario 2 only) . There will be no changes to Clinical Thresholds or Pathways arising from the implementation of the new quality standards (i.e. any changes will be at levels consistent with changes seen in the past) . The current case mix of interventions will not change (for example, the relative proportion of surgical and cardiolog y interventions) . 66. Adult congenital heart disease activity has grown more quickly than paediatric over recent years and is expected to continue to do so due to improved patient survival with children surviving into adulthood. As congenital heart disease is a lifelong condition these older patients continue to require care. 67. The Growth assumptions outlined above have been compared against National Planning assumptions for all specialised services in aggregate. The NHS belongs to the people: A call to a ction 16 New Congenital Heart Disease Review 11 was published in July 2013 and sets out projections of demand and costs for services to FY 2020/21. 3.2% 3.3% 3.3% 68. used for National P lanning (1.6% to 1.7% per year) are higher than the Population change g rowth rates indicated by the data for historic trends in specialist inpatient activity for paediatric cardiac and adult CHD services (Paediatrics 0.4%, ACHD 0.7%). This is because our figures are specific to paediatric cardiac and ACHD and account for the different levels of activity across age groups and the different population projections for each. For example, around 50% of paediatric inpatient activity occurs in those aged under 1 year. For this age group ONS projections forecast a f all rather than growth, so the population e ffect on paediatric activity is relatively low. 69. The non- Demographic Growth assumptions used for National Planning (3.2% to 3.4% per year) correlate well with the ACHD patterns (3.3% per year). The National Planning non -Demographic Growth rates are higher than the non- Demographic Growth rates for paediatric cardiac activity but are based on a less specific set of data. Our data suggests that for paediatric activity in the past population growth (specifically the unexpectedly high birth rates) accounted for more of the observed activity growth than non- demographic pressures, and more so than for adults. 70. Considering the above, we believe our activity projections and thus our assumptions about funding available are sufficiently prudent. Further, as our projection are lower than assumptions for specialised commissioning in general we are not expecting paediatric cardiac and ACHD services to become an increasing proportion of the total specialised commissioning budget. 71. Given the uncertainty over future growth rates, as described above, two scenarios have been developed, firstly where growth reflects only projected population growth and secondly where growth reflects the continuation of the average historic growth rates (2003/4 -2012/13 for paediatric activity, 2006/7- 2012/13 for ACHD activity - due to data issues) . The historic trend has been broadly linear, and therefore the rate of growth in the future is assumed to be linear under both scenarios. 72. Scenario 1 - Population growth only Growth (per annum) 2012 -13 6,100 73. Scenario 2 - Population growth + Average historic growth rates Growth (per annum) 2012 -13 2025 -26 Paediatric Outpatients 1.0% 91,500 9,200 Future projections of spend 74. Applying our activity growth assumptions (from paragraph 59 above) to our estimate of baseline spend ( from paragraph 37 above) allows us to generate our financial forecast for the adult congenital heart disease and paediatric cardiac specialised services from the perspective of commissioners paying for services under National Tariff . 75. This estimate considers only services paid for under National Tariff and i n order to demonstrate more clearly the impact of activity growth, takes no account of deflation/in flation in National Tariff . 76. The following table presents a summary of estimates for baseline and projected commissioning spend by 2025/26 for the two activity growth scenarios presented. 77.

The waterfall chart above presents the movements in costs for scenario 2. 80. For providers the financial impact in the intervening years will involve a linear increase for variable costs. The detail of the calculation of these spending projections is available in A nnex A . 81. By 20 25/26 it is expected that additional funding within a range of \u00a37.0m to \u00a3 29.8m will need to be made available to commission CHD services to meet increased activity levels based on current configuration of providers. Affordability 82. Based on the information set out above we expect: The affordability challenge for commissioners will be in meeting the costs of overall growth. The additional costs of the standard itself should be affordable for providers within tariff income particularly given growth in activity. 83. This is discussed in more detail below. 84. Affordability for commissioners: The implementation of the proposed quality standards is not currently estimated to result in new investment by commissioners, although this should be reconfirmed when implementation options have been developed. The affordability challenge for commissioners will be in meeting the costs of overall growth. 140.1 110.37.022.8 costsWaterfall Chart showing the movement in expected costs for Adult and Paediatric CHD between FY 12/13 and FY 2025/26 \u00a3m 19 New Congenital Heart Disease Review 14 85. The increase in commissioner expenditure as mod elled for the population plus historic growth model (Scenario 2) is significant and in common with other services, options to increase affordability may need to be considered and the impact evaluated. 86. These may include: additional Quality, Innovation, Productivity and Prevention ( QIPP ) schemes to reduce demand and reduce provider expenditure (e.g. Specialist Nurse -led follow -up); or commissioners to increase the share of their budgets that are directed to CHD; or measures to increase efficiency, such as reducing the number of networks (for example, creating multi- centre networks) or reducing the number of surgical centres . 87. Affordability for providers: The additional costs of the standard itself should be affordable for providers within tariff income particularly given growth in activity. 88. The projected increase in activity will provide an additional contribution to semi -fixed costs and overheads built into the current National Tariff . These funds could be directed in a way so as to meet the costs of the new standards . 89. The table below shows that even with investment in the main expected costs, providers would still have significant remaining income as a result of rising activity to cover semi -fixed costs and some as yet unidentified costs of the proposed standards. As has been discussed, the position for any individual provider may be different but cannot be determined at this stage. Table 1: Provider Cost of 6 additional surgeons -3,000 (30% of Tariff) Remaining costs and proposed standards1,900 6,800 17,860 26,890 Specialist Nurses (2 Band 6 \u00a344k annual cost) -880 -880 -880 -880 Psychologists Cost Impact 2025/26 20 New Congenital Heart Disease Review 15 Note: numbers may not sum due to rounding. Scenarios: 1a - Population Growth only (principal paediatric pop growth ) 1b - Population growth only (high paediatric pop growth) - sensitivity upper bound 2a - Population growth + histo ric activity increase (principal paediatric pop growth) 2b - Population growth + historic activity increase (high paediatric pop growth) - sensitivity upper bound 90. This allows for investment to meet other potential costs of: developing Education and Training and Networks offices and administrative support IT development and analytical support 91. The number of surgeons will only rise as and when activity rises because of the need to maintain surgical skills reflected in the standards. This means that there will be a lag between the increase in the activity and the surgical capacity, which further means that providers will have the additional income from that increased activity before they have to increase these staff costs. 92. Using scenario 2 at the highest rate of growth projected (Population and non- population growth), the table above demonstrates that under 2a, after costs for additional surgeons (estimated at \u00a3500k per Surgeon), Specialist Nurses and Psychologists are taken into account and the variable costs associated with the increased activity, on average each of the 10 specialist centres retains up to \u00a31.6m to meet additional internal costs arising. As has been discussed, the position for any individual provider may be different but cannot be determined at this stage, currently around 20% of activity occurs outside of these specialist centres and this would need to be considered. 93. As well as finances other resources may be constrained: Specialist Consultants, Specialist Nurses and Psychologists are staff who have specific training and skills . Training costs and lead times for recruitment must be taken into account and discussions with Health Education England are expected to take place as part of provider implementation planning and development . Efficiency and Value for Money 94. We expect the introduction of the new standards for CHD services to: increase the quality of ca re; improve health outcomes and patient experience; improve levers for commissioners to increase quality ; \u00a3000's \u00a3000's \u00a3000's \u00a3000's Remaining Income available for semi-fixed costs and proposed standards 190 680 1,786 2,689 Specialist Nurses (2 Band 6 ) -88 -88 -88 Psychologists ( 2 ) -86 -86 -86 -86 Remaining to meet other costs 16 506 1,612 2,515On average for each of 10 centres 21 New Congenital Heart Disease Review 16 improve clarity for providers as well as reduce adverse events and complaints ; not change the expected number of interventions on the various clinical pathways ; lead to more suitably trained Consultant Surgeons to undertake the additional activity; and ensure existing providers respond with improvements to quality of service delivery and to increase resources where necessary - the costs of which will be available to them from additional tariff income . 95. We do not expect this to require specific funding. We expect the costs to be covered through the estimated additional funding of \u00a37 m to \u00a329.8m by 2025 /26 to meet activity increases which will be cost pressure on commissioning budgets regardless of whether or not the standards are introduced. 96. A lack of suitable data on patient quality of life has not allowed a quality- adjusted life year ( QALY) based calculation to undertake an economic assessment of the value of the proposed changes . 97. At this stage in the review, the purpose of this finance assessment is to consider how the proposals described in the main part of the consultation document could be funded, to help inform the responses from the consultees. Post -consultation, once a final set of standards have been agreed and recommended, the implementation of them will be further considered and the preparation of a more detailed financial Business Case will be appropriate. Implementation options could involve changes to the location , co-location and distribution of facilities and specialist staff for hospital -based CHD activity which would have an impact on the overall costs of the service. However , there would be additional costs and benefits to consider also, particularly on patients, and there would be non- recurrent costs of such a service change. As discussed above, the review is not yet at the stage of consider ing implementation options. Benefits Mechanism 98. The new standards will reduce variation and improve quality of care because: The standards define excellent care which is not currently being delivered consistently . The commissioners will have a means of contracting with providers on a consistent basis across the country . The standards will be clear, defined and credible enabling commissioners to take action where they are not being met . Occasional practice will be eliminated thereby addressing an obvious risk to patient safety . Providers will have clarity about the requirements of them, and after 14 years of service review this will enable them to plan for the future and direct investment appropriately . Relationships between providers will be improved by working as part of formal managed networks and will enable shared learning and peer review . Patients and their families will know what they should expect from their service providers and be empowered to raise questions where they feel this is not being met and/or to exercise patient choice. 22 New Congenital Heart Disease Review 17 Outcomes 99. As a result of reduced variation and improved quality of care from adopting the new standards we expect: improvements in health outcomes and patient experience; patients, their families and the public will be assured that the care they receive will be of a consistently high qualit y wherever they live in England; commissioners will be assured of the quality of care and that additional expenditure for increased activity will be directed to services of increasing quality and not just quantity; and providers will reduce their risk of litigation, see fewer complaints and resource- consuming investigations . 100. As can be seen from above, the new standards define how services should be organised and delivered; they do not define new clinical interventions or change the threshold for treatment. As a result it is difficult to q uantify the direct impact on health outcomes. Further, the only reliable data available on health outcomes is the survival at 30 days post -procedure (surgery or catheter). We do not yet have robust information on survival at 1 year post -procedures or any other indicators of morbidity or educational attainment - work is underway to see what improvements can be made to the data and information available. Conclusions 101. The proposed quality standards of care for CHD services will improve the quality of patient outcomes and patient and carer experience without changes to the existing patient pathways. 102. Demand and activity is projected to increase to 2025/26 whether or not the new quality standards are implemented. The actual rate of increase will reflect population growth and potentially would exceed this should the recent trend interventions continue. 103. Commissioner spending will need to increase to meet the additional demand and activity. 104. Many of the costs of providing services to the standards are already within tariff funding. Some additional costs will impact on providers to meet the requirement for the appropriate number of surgeons, Specialist CHD nurses and Psychologists. 105. The additional activity and consequential commissioner spending will increase the income of providers and this is likely to cover, on average, the costs of the wholly new aspects of the standards for providers. Recommendations 106. The approval for the consultation process for the n ew standards should proceed to the next stag e as we do not expect the proposed standards would require material extra funding beyond that needed in the 'Do Nothing' scenario given current tariff and the projected increase in activity for both paediatric and adult CHD services. 23 New Congenital Heart Disease Review 18 ANNEX A Figure 2: Activity and Expenditure Forecast Population Growth low growth) PAEDIATRICS 24 New Congenital Heart high growth) ADULTS PAEDIATRICS 25 New Congenital Heart Disease Review 20 Figure 3: Activity and Expenditure Forecast Population Growth and Rate per Head Increase Year INCREASED INTERVENTION RATE (paediatric low growth) ADULTS PAEDIATRICS 26 New Congenital Heart + INCREASED INTERVENTION RATE (paediatric high growth) ADULTS 27 New Congenital Heart Disease Review 22 ANNEX B Consultant Team cost estimate Cost include salaries and on- costs.

Both sources have some weaknesses and difficulties with interpretation and therefore this analysis draws on both sources, as appropriate, to triangulate the data and thus to increase confidence in our findings. The data sources used are: National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research (NICOR) Central Cardiac Audit Database (CCAD) which reports procedure numbers. Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) Admitted Patient Care (APC) which is derived from Secondary Uses Service (SUS) data and reports episodes of care. Data for adult services is flawed from both sources: Although reporting has improved, not all units undertaking adult surgery/interventional cardiolog y report that activity to NICOR; and the way in which Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) activity is coded means it is not easy to distinguish CHD activity from other cardiac services . While there are therefore concerns about the quality of data for ACHD activity the information presented is the best available and we consider it to be sufficiently robust for this purpose of informing this finance assessment. Analysing this data we have found that: Paediatric activity has grown steadily by around 10% above population growth over the last 10 years . ACHD activity has grown by over 20% above population growth over the last 7 years, but is from a much lower base (so big % change may be small in absolute numbers). Note: figures may not sum due to rounding and compound affects Paediatric activity growth has been mainly driven by growth in activity for those aged under 1 year old, which itself has been driven by growth in the birth rate. See table below. Note: figures may not sum due to rounding and compound affects Paed Cardiac 2003 -2012 ACHD 2006 -2012 HES (0 3% Activity population growth 21% activity 8% -2% -1% 29 New Congenital Heart Disease Review 24 We think the key demand drivers include technology/medical advances, increased patient expectations and clinician's willingness to treat, increased patient survival and for paediatric activity in particular the increasing % of patients who are of BME ethnicity (where there is some evidence of higher incidence and also of a greater proportion of serious anomalies). We think increased patient survival has been a significant driver of adult activity in the past and will continue to be. Of the identified demand drivers the only one that can be separately modelled going forward is population growth (by age, sex and area). Modelling is based on ONS 2012 based projections. While this is the bes t information available these have not always been accurate in the past because of unanticipated changes to the population and birth rates. The effect of all the other demand drivers over the last ten years is included in the historic trend in activity growth above population growth. This is not perfect, but it the best we can do under existing data constraints. We are confident that this represents a reasonable upper bound scenario for us to consider. Therefore we have looked at two key scenarios for future activity: Scenario 1: Population growth only (England and Wales). Scenario 2: As for 1 but also allowing activity per head to increase at the same rate as it has in the past. These scenarios suggest that up to 2025/6: Paediatric activity could be expected to grow by between 0.4% and 1% pa However, this is very sensitive to the birth rate projections which ONS has previously underestimated - under ONS' high variant projections expected growth would be between 1% and 2% pa. ACHD activity could be between 0.7% and 4% pa. 30 New Congenital Heart Disease Review 25 ANNEX D Benefits and Value for Money Improvements in health outcomes and patient experience The below table sets out how each area of the new standards will improve patient outcomes and experience: Standard Impact on patient outcomes and experience Section A: Networks Hospitals and clinicians will work together locally, regionally and nationally to provide the best possible care for patients . Patients, their families and their carers will have a better experience as the services they receive will be more joined up and will work around the patients . Section B: Staffing Wherever patients receive their care, the centres will have the right staffing with the right skills, and if necessary will refer patients to another unit if they need more specialist care, or will bring in expert support. Occasional practice will be eliminated removing an obvious risk to patient safety . Section C: Facilities Patients, families and carers will be able to live as nor mally as possible during times spent in hospital . Section D: Interdependencies Wherever patients receive their care, all the experts they are likely to need are on site or available very quickly . Section E: Education and training Patients, families and c arers will be cared for by staff who are appropriately trained in the skills needed to perform their jobs . Section F: Governance and audit Patients, families and carers will benefit from clearly organised systems focused on patient care and improved outcomes . Section G: Research Patients, families and carers will benefit from research that adds to the understanding of congenital heart disease now and in the future Section H: Communication Patients, families and carers will have a better understanding of congenital heart disease, the care provided and what the options are. They will also be encouraged to offer feedback and complain if they need to. Section I: Transition Young people will have the help and support they need as they grow up and move from children's into adult services . Section J: Pregnancy and maternity Patients will be able to make informed choices in relation to contraception, termination, pregnancy and maternity . Pregnant women who are at risk will be cared for in the most appropriate setting. Section K: Fetal Diagnosis Patients will receive the same high quality fetal anomaly screening wherever they live and will receive the support care, and information they need if an anomaly is suspected . Section L: Palliative care Patients, familie s and carers will receive all the support they need once on the end of life pathway whether that be in the hospital or in the community, including at home. 31 New Congenital Heart Disease Review 26 Section M: Dental Patients who are at risk because of dental problems will be identified and treated . Value for money The above benefits section sets out why these new standards are important and the benefits we expect to see. Below summarises the key benefits identified and considers whether or not these would be realised under a ' do nothing ' option and compares this with the expected costs. Do nothing New standards Benefits Improvements in health outcomes and patient experience No - No mechanism to improve the quality of care The standards define excellent care The commissioners will be able to contract with providers on a consistent basis and able to take action where they are not being met Providers will have clarity about the requirements of them which will enable them to plan for the future and direct investment appropriately Working as a network will enable provider peer review and sharing of ideas Occasional practice will be eliminated Patients and their families will know what they should expect from their service providers and be empowered to raise questions where they feel this is not being met and/or to exercise patient choice Patients, their families and the public will be assured that the care they receive will be of a consistently high quality wherever they live in England No - the service review would be unresolved and the p osition would be the same as it has been previously Commissioners will be assured of the quality of care and that additional expenditure for increased activity will be directed to services of increasing quality and not just quantity No - No mechanism to improve the quality of care Providers will reduce their risk of litigation, se e fewer complaints and resource - consuming investigations No - No mechanism to improve the quality of care Costs Additional commissioner expenditure to fund activity growth \u00a37m to 29.8m by 2025/26 Congenital Heart D isease Review Draft national standards and service specifications for congenital heart disease services: draft equality analysis Equality and diversity are at the heart of NHS England's values. Throughout the development of the policies and processes cited in this document, we have given due regard to the need to: reduce health inequalities in access and outcomes of healthcare services, integrate services where this may reduce health inequalities; eliminate discrimination, harassment and victimisation ; and advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations between people who share a relevant protected characteristic (as cited in the Equality Act 2010) and those who do not share it . What are the intended outcomes of this work? Congenital heart disease is a term for a range of birth defects that affect the normal workings of the heart. The treatment for congenital heart disease depends on the defect. Mild defects, such as a small ventricular septal defect ( a hole in the heart), often do not need to be treated, as they may improve on their own and may not cause any further problems, or will just need regular monitoring by a cardiologist. If the defect is significant and is causing problems, surgery (or sometimes a less invasive procedure) may be required. Modern surgical techniques can often restore most or all of the heart's normal function. However, people with congenital heart disease often do need treatment over their l ife and, therefore, require specialist review during childhood and adulthood. This is because people with complex heart problems can develop further problems with their heart rhythm , muscle or valves over time. The new Congenital Heart Disease review The new Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) review (\" the review \") was set up in June 2013 to consider the whole lifetime pathway of care for people with CHD to achieve: the best outcomes for all patients, not just lowest mortality but reduced disability and an improved opportunity for survivors to lead better lives; tackling variation so that services across the country consistently meet demanding performance standards and are able to offer resilient 24/7 care; and excellent patient experience, which includes how information is provided to patients and their families, considerations of access and support for families when they have to be away from home. 33 New Congenital Heart D isease Review 2 The development of national standards to be applied through national service specifications is at the heart of the review's approach. This reflects the views of stakeholders from across the spectrum and is recognised in the review's objectives. The review's six objectives: 1. to develop standards to give improved outcomes, minimal variation and improved patient experience for people with CHD ; 2. to analyse demand for specialist inpatient CHD care, now and in the future; 3. to make recommendations on function, form and capacity of services needed to meet that demand, taking account of accessibility and health impact ; 4. to make recommendations on the commissioning and change management approach including an assessment of workforce and training needs ; 5. to establish a system for the provision of information about the performance of CHD services to inform the commissioning of these services and patient choice; and 6. to improve antenatal and neonatal detection rates . Draft service standards and specifications We are consulting on draft standards and specifications for CHD services for children and adults (there is currently a set of standards and a service specification in place for children's services but standards only exist in draft form for adults). This equality analysis sets out the evidence we have considered as we have worked with others to develop these standards. Draft standards The draft standards cover the following: the network approach; staffing and skills ; facilities ; interdependencies ; training and education; organisation, governance and audit ; research; communication with patients ; transition; pregnancy and contraception; fetal diagnosis ; palliative care and bereavement ; and dentistry . We are producing standards and specifications which will enable commissioners to describe and commission an excellent service, within the available resource, and which 34 New Congenital Heart D isease Review 3 will help ensure that services are all meeting the same criteria and in doing this, reduce inequalities in CHD service provision and outcomes. While some standards could have a bearing on how/where services are delivered (insofar as they make proposals as to surgeon numbers, caseloads and mixes, interdependencies and sub- specialisation), there is no predetermined outcome about the configuration of provider units. We await responses from the consultation to inform the final form of the standards, and the future consideration of the subsequent shape of services. Scope of this equality analysi s It is important to stress that the work on objectives 2-6 above is not the subject of the current consultat ion or this equality analysis , but our future work will be informed by what we hear in consultation. Future thinking on, for example, function, form and capacity w ill be subject to the equality duty, in so far as it relates to the configuration of services to meet demand. We will consider feedback to this consultation, alongside future evidence and where appropriate, further equality analyses woul d be produced. Furthermore, as the sole national Commissioner, NHS England will need to ensure monitoring of the duty as part of contract management with service providers . We hope that this draft equality analysis will demonstrate the information that ha s informed our thinking so far , and provide an opportunity for stakeholders, and the general public alike, to share this and to enhance their own understanding and ours, by: considering and commenting on the evidence we have included, and helping us to fill in the gaps. Who will be a ffected by this work? It is estimated that across England and Wales between 5 and 9 in every 1,000 pregnancies are associated with some form of CHD based on information collected by the British Isles Network of Congenital Anomaly Registers (BINOCAR 1). The number of babies born with CHD will increase if the total numbers of babies being born continues to rise2. Future birth rates are very difficult to predict. In their 'principal' projections, the Office of Natio nal Statistics (ONS) predicts that birth rates will fall over the next 10 years rates. But under their 'high' projections, ONS recognises that birth rates could rise.3 Because of improvements in treatment, people with CHD can now expect to live longer than ever before. B etween 1979 -1983 and 2004- 2008, the number of deaths from CHD in children under 15 years fell by 83% in the UK 4. As a result, the number of people living with CHD is rising. This means that in the future we are likely to see the service m oving from one that has been centred around children, to one that is treating a growing number 1 Table 1.1 and 5.1, \"Congenital Anomaly Statistics 2011, England and Wales\", BINOCAR, September 2013, found at: http://www.binocar.org/content/Annual%20report%202011_FINAL_040913.pdf 2 tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77- 318453 4 heart defects in England and Wales, 1959- 2009: exploring technological change through period and birth cohort analysis Knowles RL, Bull C, Wren C, Dezateux C (2012) Arch Dis Child, 2012 Oct: 97(10): 861-5 35 New Congenital Heart D isease Review 4 of young people and adults. Advances in paediatric cardiology, intensive care medicine, and cardiac surgery mean that the number of children with congenital hear t disease (CHD) surviving into adulthood continues to increase. Hence, adults will constitute an ever - growing population 5, who will continue to have (often complex) health needs. For many defects treated in childhood, further problems can develop later in life that require medical care or further surgery6. As well as people with CHD, this work will affect their families and carers, all members of the multidisciplinary clinical teams who support patients with CHD, and hospital managers, in particular those with specialist CHD units . Paediatric cardiac services also care for children with acquired and inherited cardiac diseases (although CHD accounts for most of their work). These children and their families and carers will also be affected. Evidence Our evidence has come from a range of sources. Key sources of evidence for the review in general , and the standards in particular , have been advice from : patients; clinicians ; provider leaders ; academics and other experts; and the wider public through correspondence and responses to our blog . We have gathered evidence from: our patients' and public, providers' and clinicians' engagement and advisory groups; the groups that have developed the draft CHD standards; the Clinical Advisory Panel; visits to 13 Trusts with specialist CHD units where we had the opportunity to meet staff and patients ; and nine meetings across England with children and young people. A report is available at http://www.england.nhs.uk/wp- content/uploads/2014/07/chd- cap- 6.pdf . To inform our thinking on standards and the other objectives of the review, we have put in place other pieces of work to gather evidence. This has been done in parallel with the work of the review's lead analyst who has been progressing work on Objective 2 (including interrogating Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) data). We have also commissioned a systematic literature review; and asked the National Institute for Cardi ovascular Outcomes Research ( NICOR) to investigate their data. Systematic literature review (papers since 2003 or earlier if few papers) 5 Delivery of care for adult patients with congenital heart disease in Europe: results from the Euro Heart Survey , Moons et al (2006) European Heart Journal 27, 1324- 1330 6 Care and Treatment for congenital heart defects (2011) American Heart Association http://heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/CongenitalHeartDefects 36 New Congenital Heart D isease Review 5 The independent systematic literature review, undertaken by The University of Sheffield, School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR) on our behalf, aimed to understand how organisational factors may affect patient outcomes focusing on: W hat is the current evidence for the relationship between institutional and surgeon volume and patient outcomes, and how is the relati onship influenced by complexity of procedure and by patient case mix? How are patient outcomes influenced by proximity to/co- location with other specialist clinical services (e .g. co- location of services such as specialist paediatric intensive care)? National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research - data analysis The National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research (NICOR) was asked to examine its data and to advise on what this showed about service factors that could influence outcomes. Although the final write- up of this work is not yet available, NICOR has kindly supplied a summary of the main findings and these have been incorporated in this paper. NICOR run the Congenital Heart Disease Audit using patient information collected by the Central Cardiac Audit Database (CCAD). We asked them to consider whether the information collected could be used to further understand the relationship between certain organisational or patient factors and patient outcomes. NICOR have helped us understand better the association between 30- day mortality rates in relation to ethnicity and social deprivation. We see the gathering of evidence as part and parcel of our continuing work. To this end, we propose to hold further engagement and advisory meetings and targeted work with some groups that share protected characteristics: BAME communities; people with learning disabilities and adults with CHD. In the following sections we consider what impact our proposed standards for congenital heart disease might have on each of the nine protected characteristics: Age Disability Gender reassignment Marriage and civil partnership Pregnancy and maternity Race Religion and belief Sex Sexual orientation We have also considered carers and geographical variations. 37 New Congenital Heart D isease Review 6 Age The draft standards are intended to ensure that everyone with CHD gets the best possible care within the available resource. Changing CHD population CHD related episodes by age and as percentage of total (2012/ 13 HES data) Age band Age Episodes % total Neonate 0 to 30 days 1297 12% Infant 30 to 365 days 2318 21% Child 1 -16 1 to 16 years 4296 39% Child 17 -18 17 to 18 years 695 6% Adult 19 -64 19 to 64 years 1856 17% Adult 65+ 65 years+ 600 5% 0% Note: includes all episodes in NHS England providers for all patients (not just England and Wales) Mortality from CHD has decreased over the past 30 years; between 1979- 1983 and 2004- 2008, absolute numbers of deaths from CHD in children under 15 years declined by 83% in the UK 7. As the birth prevalence of CHD is thought to have remained more stable over this time period8, it can be inferred that a large part of this decline in mortality is due to improved survival. Knowles et al. found that while deaths rates in the first year of life have been reducing throughout the period studied, drops in mortality in all age groups has only been observed for birth cohorts originating after 1989 9. There is a suggestion from our own analysis and what we have heard that there has been an increase in demand for adult congenital heart disease care, not just among people in their twentie s (i.e. birth cohorts originating after 1989). Whereas in the past, mortality rates were higher in the early days and months, now more children in the UK with CHD benefit from advances in paediatric cardiac surgery and intensive care, and receive treatment and reach adulthood. The greatest decline in deaths from congenital heart disease has occurred in those aged less than one year. This means that in the future, as more people survive, we are likely to see the service moving from one that is centred around children to one that is treating a growing number of young people and adults, who will continue to have (often complex) health needs . This has consequences for the way in which services are delivered (and what sort of services are delivered) for both children and young people (and their different needs and expectations) through to transition for y oung people into adult services . 7 Mortality with congenital heart defects in England and Wales, 1959- 2009: exploring technological change through period and birth cohort analysis Knowles RL, Bull C, Wren C, Dezateux C (2012) Arch Dis Child, 2012 Oct: 97(10): 861-5 8 Temporal variability in birth prevalence of cardiovascular malformations Wren C, Richmond S, Donaldson L (2000). Heart; 83: 414-9 9 Op. cit. 38 New Congenital Heart D isease Review 7 For many defects treated in childhood, further problems can develop later in life which then require medical care or further surgery10. In Children and young people: Statistics 201311, the British Heart Foundation notes: 'Treatment of adults with congenital heart disease is relatively new as more children with congenital heart defects receive treatment and reach adulthood. As a result of the success of paediatric cardiology and cardiac surgery over the last four decades, it is thought that more adults with congenital heart disease will require medical care than children12' (page 15). The re port authors go on to highlight the importance of ensuring that facilities are adequate at transition. Age and CHD: What we have heard during pre -consultation Increasing need for adult congenital heart disease services We have heard that there is a need for increasing capacity in adult congenital heart disease services and that some centres are expanding facilities and recruiting new staff. Age-sensitive services During pre- consultation, we have heard from patients, families and carers that services need to be age- sensitive and that effective transition is vital. This relates to effective and appropriate communication, but also to the facilities provided. Young people have told us that they would like more information about sex and relationships and this needs to be away from parents - many teenagers are uncomfortable speaking about any of these things in front of their parents and some don't even like the idea of speaking with their regular doctors. Our draft standards emphasise, in several places, the importance of open, honest communication in ways that are appropriate to the patient's needs. In addition we have also developed specific standards on: communication with patients ; transition; and pregnancy and cont raception. We believe that the standards will have a positive impact on the experience and outcomes of all children and adults with CHD. For the first time services will be nationally commissioned using common service specifications across all ages. We welcome more information/evidence . 10 Care and Treatment for congenital heart defects (2011) American Heart Association http://heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/CongenitalHeartDefects 11 Children and young people: Statistics 2013 (2013) Townsend N, Bhatnagar P, Wickrama singhe K, Williams J, Vujcich D, Rayner M, British Heart Foundation: London 12 Task force on the management of grown up congenital heart disease of the European Society of Cardiology (2003) European Heart Journal; 24: 1035- 1084 39 New Congenital Heart D isease Review 8 Disability The draft standards are intended to ensure that everyone with CHD gets the best possible care within the available resource . Children and adults with congenital heart disease are at an increased risk of developing further problems. Many children with congenital heart disease experience delays in their development. For example, they may take longer to start walking or talking. They may also have lifel ong problems with physical coordination. Some children with congenital heart disease also have learning difficulties. These are thought to be caused by a poor oxygen supply during early life, which affects the development of the brain. Natural intelligence is usually unaffected, but some children often perform well below the academic level they would be expected to reach. This is because of problems such as: impaired memory ; problems expressing themselves using language; problems understanding the language of others ; low attention span and difficulty concentrating ; poor planning abilities ; and poor impulse control - acting rashly without thinking about the possible consequences . Recent research has found that children who have had surgery for transposition of the great arteries have significant problems related to a concept known as theor y of mind (TOM). TOM is the ability to understand other people's mental states and recognise that they may differ from your own. In other words, to recognise that everyone has their own set of desires, intentions, beliefs, emotions, perspective, likes and dislikes. In simple terms, TOM is the ability to see the world through another person's eyes. An inability to recognise other people's mental states can lead to problems with social interaction and behaviour in later life. Congenital heart disease as a complication of Down's syndrome Around 50% of children with Down's syndrome have a congenital heart defect and around 60% of children with Down's syndrome who are born with a heart defect require treatment in hospital. Septal defects account for 9 out of 10 cases of congenital heart disease in people with Down's syndrome. A septal defect is a hole inside one of the walls that separate the four chambers of the heart, often referred to as a 'hole in the heart'. Less common but serious types of congenital heart disease in people with Down's syndrome include: tetralogy of Fallot (accounts for 6% and patent ductus arteriosus (accounts for around 4% of cases). 40 New Congenital Heart D isease Review 9 As noted above in relation to age, it is possible that in complex congenital heart diseas e cases, further problems (which could include a disability) will develop later in life that will require medical care or further surgery13. Disability and CHD: What we have heard during pre -consultation We heard about the importance of ensuring the standards respect the needs of people with disabilities. We have proposed standards that address the needs of all patients and have included particular standards that relate to learning disability, for example in relation to: communication with patients; and transition. We believe that the standards will have a positive impact on the experience and outcomes of all children and adults with CHD, a number of whom have a disability. For the first time services will be nationally commissioned using common service specifications across all ages. We welcome more information/evidence .

Cardiac disease is a leading cause of maternal death in pregnancy14. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) published a Good Practice guideline in 2011 which noted that pregnancy carries increased risks for women with congenital heart disease and particular efforts should be made to prevent any unwanted pregnancies. In particular teenage girls with congenital he art disease should have access to a specialist who can advise on contraception and later in life on preconception counselling. RCOG also noted the importance of ensuring that women with CHD: who go to their GP or midwife for advice are referred promptly to an appropriate high-risk pregnancy and heart disease team and see a cardiologist to establish how well the heart is working and discuss how pregnancy may impact their health. who want to become pregnant or who are pregnant visit their obstetrician and ideally should talk to them jointly with a cardiologist . Fetal diagnosis We are undertaking separate work (Objective 6) to improve fetal diagnosis of congenital heart disease. Pregnancy and maternity and CHD: What we have heard during consultation We have heard that there is a possibility that increased fetal diagnoses could in some cases increase terminations and reduce activity. But in other cases, it could increase the chance of survival and increase activity. We have also heard that as a consequence of better care for people with congenital heart disease, more are going on to have their own children. This means that it is very important that there are close links between maternity services and ACHD services, and that deliveries are planned for safety. We have developed specific standards on: pregnancy and contraception; and fetal diagnosis . We believe that the proposed standards alongside our work to improve antenatal and neonatal detection rates (Objective 6) will have a positive impact on the experience and outcomes of women with CHD who are considering pregnancy, are pregnant or are receiving maternity care. For the first time services will be nationally commissioned using common service specification s.

CHD related episodes by ethnicity and as percentage of total (201 2/3 HES data) Ethnicity (%) Specialist inpatient Episodes Specialist inpatient Patients ONS 2011 Census 66% Ethnicity (%) inpatient Episodes Specialist inpatient Patients ONS 2011 Census ACHD White 79 % 79% mixed 0% 0% 2% Not 5 % N/A Not Stated 7% 7% N/A Note: ONS 2011 census do not use the same ethnic groups as HES so not directly comparable but give some sense of how the ethnic mix of activity for specialist inpatient CHD care compares to the general population of England and Wales. The HES data above indicates that the majority of CHD episodes are among those patients classified as white, followed by those patients classified as Asian. Ethnicity and prevalence Research dating back to the 1980s15 and 1990s16 demonstrated higher prevalence among Asian communities in various UK cities including Manchester and Leeds, and in the West Midlands. In the 1980s research links were made between CHD and consanguinity in the Asian Muslim population. More recently in Cons anguinity and the risk of congenital heart 15 Gatrad AR, Reap AP, Watson GH Consanguinity and complex cardiac anomalies with situs ambiguous, Arch.Dis Child 1984; 59: 242-5 16 JGC, de Giovanni JV, Billingham C, Silove ED Influence of ethnic origin on the pattern of congenital heart defects in the first year of life Br Heart J 1995; 73: 173- 176 43 New Congenital Heart D 12 disease, (2012)17 JT Shieh et al . undertook a systematic review of consanguinity in CHD, focusing on non- syndromic disease, with the methodologies and results from studies of different ethnic populations compared. They found that the majority of studies support the view that consanguinity increases prevalence of CHD, but found only three population- based studies controlled for potential socio- demographic confounding. The results suggested that the risk for CHD is increased in consanguineous unions in the studied populations, principally at first cousin level and closer. For more precise risk estimates a better understanding of the underlying disease factors is needed. It has been suggested that we should consider whether and how to raise awareness of the risk of CHD within these communities . Ethnicity and outcomes We asked NICOR to see whether there was any link between ethnicity and the 30- day outcome after paediatric surgery. NICOR have used a 2009- 12 dataset and a P artial Risk Adjustment in Surgery (PRAiS) model 18 recalibrated to evaluate the candidate risk factors for ethnicity. The PRAiS model assigns risk of death by 30 days after the first surgical operation (29 different specific procedures ) in 30 -day episodes of surgical management. NICOR's analysis of data from 13 paediatric surgery centres (12,186 episodes of care in paediatric heart surgery during April 2009 to March 2012 inclusive) showed that Asian ethnicity is asso ciated with poorer outcomes (30- day post -operative mortality). This is a statistically significant finding. Other categories of ethnicity (Black, Chinese and Other) did not have statistically different risk from the Caucasian category. Other factors beyond simple ethnicity may play a factor in this finding, such as deprivation and a higher incidence of consanguinity which is associated with more complex congenital heart disease and therefore less good outcomes. Race and CHD: What we have heard during pre -consultation We believe that the standards will have a positive impact on the experience and outcomes of children and adults from ethnic minorities with CHD.

Our draft standards emphasise, in several places, t he importance of open , honest communication in ways that are appropriate to the patient's needs. We welcome more information/evidence . Carers The draft standards are intended to ensure that everyone with CHD gets the best possible care within the available resource. It will be important to ensure that parents and carers of children with CHD have access to the information and any psychological support they might need. Carers and CHD: What we have heard during pre -consultation In addition, we have heard how important it is for parents and carers to be supported, particularly when they are away from home. They have told us about difficulties with finding their way round new hospitals, finding accommodation and eating balanced meals. They have also told us about problems with car parking. We have also heard how important it is to have support for end of life and poor outcomes. This means having identified support structures that encourage and enable open and honest communication with families and carers at that time. We have developed specific standards on: facilities ; and palliative care and bereavement. 46 New Congenital Heart D isease Review 15 We believe that the standards will have a positive impact on the experience and outcomes for families and carers, ensuring that they are recognised and appropriately supported in their care of children and adults with CHD. For the first time services will be nationally commissioned using common service specifications. We welcome more information/evidence . Geographical variation While not a protected characteristic, we have looked at CHD- related episodes (specialist inpatient activity) by area as percentage of total, and episodes per head of population (2012/ 3 HES data) Area Team of patient residence % of all specialist inpatient episodes Specialist inpatient episodes per 100,000 (0- 18) population Specialist inpatient episodes per 100,000 (19+) 69.9 6.6 South Yorkshire and Bassetlaw 2% 59.8 3.4 North Yorkshire and Humber Leicestershire and Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire 3% 59.7 London Wiltshire 3% Bristol, North Somerset, Somerset and South Gloucestershire 3% 63.9 6.9 Devon, Cornwall and Isles Of Scilly 3% 60.1 6.6 47 New Congenital Heart D isease Review 16 Wales 4% 52.6 2.0 Unknown 3% N/A N/A The HES data above indicates that activity is fairly evenly spread across the country with the exception of London which has a much larger population, and Birmingham and Greater Manchester who are also slightly higher. However, once we account for different populations in each area we can see there is much more variation across the country in terms of relative activity. T he episodes per 100,000 population show some differences from Wales at 52.6 and Kent and Medway at 53.7 to Merseyside at 72.4 to Birmingham and the Black Country at 86.6 (all paediatric services). In the case of adult services , the episodes per 100,000 population show differences from Wales at 2 and Essex at 3.9 to Bath, Gl oucestershire, Swindon and Wiltshire at 8.8 and Merseyside at 10.5. This is demonstrated in the maps below; the darker the colour the higher the relative activity in that area.

Where geography has been raised it has been in relation to how services are delivered now and how they might be delivered in the future. The focus has been on whether existing units will meet the standards and what it means to staff and patients if not; and travel times now and in the future. We have noted the feedback we have received during pre- consultation on the concerns about how services will be delivered in the future, and will use this to inform our thinking in relation to future work on Objectives 3, 4 and 5. We welcome more information. Engagement and Involvement Over the past 12 months we have been working with a wide range of stakeholders to develop the current draft standards. We have worked with and spoken to: children and young people with CHD and their parents and carers ; adults with CHD and their parents and carers; groups representing people with CHD ; clinicians and other members of the multidis ciplinary team ; providers ; and local authorities and Healthwatch. As well as regular meetings of formal engagement and advisory groups, we have undertaken visits to all specialist units, led by Professor Deirdre Kelly, Chair of the Clinician Group. During these visits, members of the new CHD review team had an opportunity to speak to clinical staff, and patients and their families. We also ran nine dedicated events f or children and young people around the country. 49 New Congenital Heart D isease Review 18 The draft standards have been central to our engagement and involvement work from the outset and have informed the development of the draft service specifications. For the past year we have been working with experts to develop the draft standards, and then testing them out with our engagement and advisory groups and a wider audience. We have adopted an approach of openness and transparency and all our papers are published on the NHS England Congenital Heart Disease Review website and John Holden's blog. Blog 23 contained the then- current version of the standards and so was open to everyone to see. Launch of the consultation is the next step in the process and our work on engagement and involvement is ongoing. We plan to arrange four further regional visits during consultation and to do some targeted work with the stakeholders with an interest in the following protected characteristics: Age ( specifically adults with CHD, with whom we have had less contact than children and young people) Disability (in particular , learning disability) Race Summary of analysis The evidence and engagement activity considered above has highlighted ways in which, subject to consultation and final agreement, our standards can help improve the way in which services are delivered to all those with CHD, including those in protected groups. This is particularly so in relation to: Age Disability Pregnancy and maternity Race The links between the standards and their impact on other protected groups is not so obvious. We hope to better understand how the standards might be used to support other protected groups through focused activities during the consultation - and also increase our understanding of the needs of adults with congenital heart disease. The standards and the service specifications will , once agreed, set the framework through which CHD services will be delivered. It will be important for providers to ensure that they have regard to the equality duty in the provision of these CHD services. Eliminating discrimination, harassment and victimisation The draft standards apply to CHD services for children and adults - we currently only have agreed standards and a service specification for CHD services for children. The new draft 50 New Congenital Heart D isease Review 19 standards will ensure that everyone with CHD gets the best possible care whatever their age, thereby improving the consistency of our approach with adults . Advancing equality of opportunity The draft standards apply to CHD services wherever they are delivered in the country. They apply to all services ( levels 1, 2 and 3). The draft standards will help ensure that all services are working to the same aims - and that people with CHD can receive a consistently high quality service. Promoting good relations between groups The standards will provide a consistent approach for all those with CHD in protected groups. Our work to date has also enabled us to identify some areas that are common to all groups (and not solely applicable to CHD services) and improvements in these areas will benefit all: Effective communications Information sharing between professionals Transition Evidence - based decision making Our engagem ent and involvement to date has been invaluable in enabling us to develop the current draft standards and to hear from a wide range of people. It has at the same time allowed us to develop our thinking in relation to protected groups and to identify some gaps in relation to our understanding of whether people with CHD in some protected groups have a voice and are being heard. Our work with children and young people and meeting patients and families at the hospitals we visited gave us a particular insight into issues around age (specifically children and young people, and the transition into adult services ) disability, pregnancy and maternity , and race. It has highlighted issues relating to three protected groups that would benefit from further consideration and research: How CHD services will develop to meet changing needs as the number of adults with CHD exceeds the number of children with CHD . The reason for the prevalence of CHD in some Asian communities and poorer outcomes at 30 days after first surgical procedure. How CHD services can best be developed to meet the needs of patients with a disability , in particular learning disability . 51 New Congenital Heart D isease Review 20 We are also keen during consultation to hear from people who can provide further evidence to inform our thinking in relation to those protected groups not mentioned above. Sharing this draft equality analysis As part of our assurance, this draft analysis will be shared with our programme board, the Specialised Commissioning Oversight Group, Programme of Care Board for Women and Children, the Clinical Priorities Advisory Group and the Directly Commissioned Services Committee. The draft equality analysis will form part of the reference document that will accompany the consultation document, draft standards and service specifications. As such it will be included in our communications and engagement activity at launch. We will send it to our engagement and advisory groups, our Clinical Advisory Panel and blog followers.

Objective 2 of the new congenital heart disease review is \"to analyse demand for specialist inpatient congenital heart disease care, now and in the future\". 2. The outputs of this work are an understanding of : a) current service provision and demand; b) future activity pressures that all else being equal will translate into future spend pressures; and c) future required capacity for specialist inpatient care services. 3. At this stage of the programme's work, the main focus is on how this informs the Financial Impact Assessment we are preparing for the Programme of Care (POC) Bo ard and the Clinical Priorities Advisory Group (CPAG) as part of the assurance process to approve our consultation on standards. 4. This paper asks the Programme Board to note the future activity pressures suggested by the analysis, to understand how they were derived and to agree that they form an appropriate basis for undertaking the Financial Impact Assessment. 5. To note, further work may continue over the consultation period to further refine and sensitivity test our analysis particularly as we receive comments from interested parties; as a result, the numbers may change. Analysis - Data 6. There are two reliable national sources of data on paediatric cardiac and adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) inpatient activity. Both sources have some weaknesses and difficulties with interpretation and therefore this analysis draws on both sources, as appropriate, to triangulate the data and thus to increase confidence in our findings. The data sources used are: National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research (NICOR) Central Cardiac Audit Database (CCAD) which reports procedure numbers. Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) Admitted Patient Care (APC) which is derived from Secondary Uses Service (SUS) data and reports episodes of care. 7. Data for adult services is flawed from both sources: Although reporting has improved, not all units undertaking adult surgery/interventional cardiology report that activity to NICOR; and 53New Congenital Heart Disease Review Item 7 2 the way in which Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) activity is coded means it is not easy to distinguish CHD activity from other cardiac services. 8. While there are therefore concerns about the quality of data for ACHD activity the information presented in this report is the best available and we consider it to be sufficiently robust for this purpose. Analysis - Results 9. The key findings from our analysis are summarised below: Currently, around 65 -75% of congenital heart inpatient activity is for 0 -18 year olds. Paediatric activity has grown steadily by around 10% above population growth over the last 10 years. ACHD activity has grown by over 20% above population growth over the last 7 years, but is from a much lower base (so big % change may be small in absolute numbers). We think the key demand drivers include technology/medical advances, increased patient expectations and clinician's willingness to treat, increased patient survival and for paediatric activity in particular the increasing % of patients who are of BAME ethnicity (where there is some evidence of higher incidence and also of a greater proportion of serious anomalies). Of the identified demand drivers the only one that can be separately modelled going forward is population growth (by age, sex and area) . Modelling is based on ONS projections. While this is the best information available these have not always been accurate in the past because of unanticipated changes to the population and birth rates. The effect of all the other demand drivers over the last 10 years is included in the historic trend in activity growth above population growth. Therefore we have looked at two key scenarios for future activity: o Scenario A: Population growth only (England and Wales). o Scenario B: As for A but also allowing activity per head to increase at the same rate as it has in the past. These scenarios suggest that up to 2025 /6: o Paediatric activity could be expected to grow by between 0.4% and 1% pa However, this is very sensitive to the birth rate projections which ONS has previously underestimated - under ONS' high variant projections expected growth would be between 1% and 2% pa. o ACHD activity could be between 0.7% and 4% pa. 541 Activity Analysis Update (slides 44 and 45, showing historic patient flows, have been amended / corrected since these slides were first published and circulated to the Programme Board.

NICOR data is good for paediatric activity (0 -16), HES can do both paediatric and ACHD Currently, we think around 65-75% of congenital heart inpatient activity is for 0-18 year olds Paediatric activity has grown steadily by around 10% above population growth over the last 10 years, this is driven by growth in activity for children under the age of 1 ACHD activity has grown by over 20% above population growth over the last 7 years, but is from a much lower base (so big % change may be small in absolute numbers) We think the key demand drivers include technology/medical advances, increased patient expectations and clinician's willingness to treat, increased patient survival and for paediatric activity in particular the increasing % of patients who are of BME ethnicity Some simple scenarios suggest that up to 2025: Paediatric activity could be expected to grow by between 0.4% and 1%pa (this is very sensitive to the birth rate projections - under ONS High projections it would be between 1% and 2% pa) ACHD activity could be between 0.7% and 4% pa New Congenital Heart Disease Review Item 7 Annex A 56Datasets, data issues and the definition of congenital heart disease activity New Congenital Heart Disease Review 3 Joanna Glenwright John Buckell Charles Keenan Item 7 Annex A 57We have data from NICOR and HES NICOR data: Central Cardiac Audit Database (CCAD) NICOR provided us with data by for Adults and Children (0-16), by area team of residence, provider category (NHS England etc.), type of procedure (surgery or catheter), for financial years 2003/4 to 2012/13 NICOR have a list of procedures they include, these are coded using EPCC* list NICOR data is reported by procedure, procedure type (including catheter vs surgery is verified as part of audit) * European Paediatric Cardiac Code HES data: Admitted Patient Care (APC) data We extracted data from HES based on the presence of select OPCS codes in any of the procedure fields. For each episode extracted we have a variety of fields including, patient area of residence and provider, for financial years 1997/8 to 2012/13 The list of procedures included is based on the existing Identification Rules (IR) used for paediatric cardiac (23B) (age 0-18) and ACHD (13X) (age 19+) and clinician advice. For adults in particular it is not clear that this identifies all of the relevant activity e.g. due to coding issues etc. HES data is reported by episode of care, catheter/surgery split is based on definition set of codes. 4 New Congenital Heart Disease Review Item 7 Annex A 58We have data from NICOR and HES For adult services both NICOR and HES data sources are flawed for different reasons: 1.not all adult activity is reported to the national database run by the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research (NICOR), and 2.the generic nature of Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) means it is not easy to distinguish CHD activity from other cardiac services Given 2, we have struggled to come up with a definitive list of codes that we are certain capture the relevant activity in HES. After using a series of wider definitions that captured \"too much\" activity we have settled on using the procedure codes in the current IR - this should be at least of subset of actual activity. However, we have dropped one code L13.3 (arteriography of pulmonary artery) as this was significant outlier affecting the data and where it is used alone it is likely to be diagnostic rather than therapeutic intervention. Further, in our HES extract for ACHD we found that the coding of activity pre 2006/7 looked odd. 2006/7 is a significant year for the Payment by Results system which relies on this data to pay hospitals for the activity they do. Therefore we have not used any of the ACHD data pre 2006/7 as it was distorting our analysis. As a result we have some concerns about the quality of data for ACHD activity and interpretation of any results should bear this in mind. 5 New Congenital Heart Disease Review Item 7 Annex A 59We have data from NICOR and HES Because of the different databases, different coding classifications used (EPCC vs OPCS), different coding practices and different currencies (procedures vs episodes) it is not possible to know if the activity covered by each dataset is an exact match. The next slides test how well the two datasets compare... 2012/13 data for patients in England and Wales: 6 New Congenital Heart Disease Review Age NICOR (procedures) HES ( episodes) Paediatric (0 -16) 5,700 Uplifted figure if we assume NICOR figure represents 80% of total NICOR figures won't match website as only England and Wales residents treated in NHS E providers are included in figure above - website is all patients all reporting providers To note: definition of child vs adult. NICOR define a child as aged 0-16. The IRs for specialised commissioning define a child as aged 0-18. HES data is extracted on the latter, and will use this as the main definition going forward. Where using comparison with NICOR we compare activity for 0-16 only.

HES (19+) (episodes) NICOR (17+) (procedures) Item 7 Annex A 64NICOR ACHD data - not all NHS E and Wales providers report to NICOR but the number who do has increased over time from 21 in 2006/7 to 29 in 2012/13 Both datasets may be affected by changes in reporting over time 11 New Congenital Heart Disease Review This is a key caveat when considering past trends : 2 3 4 5AverageProceduresPerEpisode 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 Year HES data - Over time there have been changes in coding practice (especially with push to PbR payment in 06/07).

This could be due to the differences in the two age groups (HES 0-18 vs NICOR 0-16) ACHD: Both HES and NICOR suggest a catheter to surgery ration of >1.5. There has been more variability over time according to HES. This could be changes in coding and difference in the two age groups (HES 19+ vs NICOR 17+) To note: We have used a list of codes in HES to flag a procedure as a catheter - this is less reliable than NICOR who verify the procedures covered by the data. *For ACHD as NICOR data is missing for some provider the ratio may be bias depending on missing activity 00.20.40.60.811.2 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012Catheter to Surgery Ratio Paed Catheter to Surgery Ratio HES (0-18) NICOR (0-16)00.511.522.5 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012Catheter to Surgery Ratio ACHD Catheter to Surgery Ratio HES (19+) NICOR (17+)*Item 7 Annex A 100Historic trends: Length of stay New Congenital Heart Disease Review Zero Length of Stay (LOS) episodes have been increasing as a proportion of the total number of episodes for both ACHD and Paediatric For those episodes that are not zero LOS, the average LOS per episode looks to have declined for ACHD and looks to be fairly stable for Paediatric activity Item 7 Annex A 101Activity Drivers New Congenital Heart Disease Review 48 Joanna Glenwright John Buckell Charles Keenan Item 7 Annex A 102We have investigated the possible drivers of activity New Congenital Heart Disease Review Levels of activity have changed over time and are different across patient resident areas beyond differences in population numbers So we need to: 1.Understand what is driving the changes over time and the differences across the country 2.Make informed assumptions about what these drivers of activity are going to do in the future To do this we have: Asked our clinician advisory group Reviewed academic literature Undertaken statistical analysis of HES data Item 7 Annex A 103What the clinician advisory group told us: 50 New Congenital Heart Disease Review Factor Relationship with activity What has it done in the past?

drivers but not quantified their effect Based on the evidence considered we expect the main drivers of CHD activity are: 1.Population growth (which is a function of birth rate, migration and life expectancy) 2.Increasing proportion of patients who are of Asian and Black ethnicity 3.Technology and medical advances 4.Increased patient longevity and survival 5.Increased expectation (patients) and willingness (clinicians) to treat 6.Increased complexity and severity of patients (possibly also driven itself by 2,3,4 and 5 above) New Congenital Heart Disease Review All of these identified drivers are expected to continue to increase and drive up activity in the future Item 7 Annex A 108Scenarios for future activity New Congenital Heart Disease Review 55 Joanna Glenwright John Buckell Charles Keenan Item 7 Annex A 109Future Activity Scenarios Of the identified demand drivers the only one that can reasonably be modelled going forward is population growth by age, sex and area The effect of all the other demand drivers over the last 10 years is wrapped up in the historic trend in activity Therefore we have looked at 2 key scenarios for future activity: Scenario A: No change in procedures per head from 2012, only pressure is increase in number the population of England and Wales Scenario B: As A but allow number of procedures per head to increase as it has in the past. 56 New

I am pleased to enclose the paper which our Board considered at its meeting in public on 18 July, which sets out our thinking on the nature of the problem and the principles which must underpin our approach. In line with our commitment to transparency, a video recording of the Board's discussion is also available, at http://www.england.nhs.uk/2013/07/22/boardvids-180713 /. Annex 1 of the Board paper describes an outline timetable for the work. We have set ourselves the hugely ambitious challenge of an implementable solution within a year. This does not mean we think the job is easy; on the contrary, it is exceedingly difficult. We have a duty to patients now and to future generations to ensure the best possible quality of care within the available resource. That means best outcomes, a positive patient experience, and consistently high levels of safety. We do not see this as a competition between providers to find \"winners\" and \"losers\". Instead, we want a single national service which sets high standards for the delivery of care, which are uniformly available to all NHS patients in England, wherever they live. Beyond this aspiration for a national service underpinned by national standards, we do not profess to know yet precisely what the answer is. We are very clear that the Independent Reconfiguration Panel's (IRP) report requires us, amongst other things, to look at children's and adults' services together, to look afresh at the demographic and other relevant data, to describe the entire pathway, and to properly involve all stakeholders throughout the work. So, we need a new process. Although the Safe and Sustainable conclusions cannot be implemented, there has nonetheless been some very good work during the past five years, with extensive involvement from clinicians and patient groups, to develop Rt Hon Jeremy Hunt MP Secretary of State for Health Richmond House 79 Whitehall London SW1A 2NS 825 1104 31 July 2013 120standards and proposals for networks. As IRP suggests, this work needs to be completed. Once validated it will give us a platform for future work, but it does not in any way require us to reach the same conclusions as the previous process. As we continue our initial discussions over the next few weeks, and begin to develop a proposition for debate in the autumn, there is bound to be speculation about the \"answer\" we have in mind. But having promised that we will listen before we act, I can assure you that we have no such prejudice. I welcome your support in reiterating this message. We are still in an extended period of listening and we regularly publish the notes from our meetings to open the debate as widely as possible. I have established a committee of the Board to give this topic the focus it deserves, and Professor Sir Mike Rawlins will chair a clinical advisory panel to support our medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh in obtaining excellent clinical engagement and advice. We are absolutely committed to achieve the service change required for these very vulnerable patients. We will exploit the full potential of NHS England as the sole national commissioner, and do so in a way that properly engages all interested parties, but at sufficient pace to mitigate the risks of further delay. Yours sincerely Professor Sir Malcolm Grant Chair 121 NHSE180713 BOARD PAPER - NHS ENGLAND Title: New review of congenital heart services Clearance: Bill McCarthy, National Director: Policy Purpose of p aper: To describe the challenge facing NHS England in improving congenital heart disease services To outline early thinking on the way forward Key issues and r ecommendations: On 12 June 2013 the Secretary of State an nounced in Parliament that the safe and sustainable proposals for children's congenital heart services could not go ahead in their current form . He went on to say that \"it is right we continue with this process, albeit in a different way\" . NHS England is t he body responsible for commissionin g specialised conge nital heart services and for taking forward the process. A new review is being established to consider the whole lifetime pathway of care for people with congenital heart disease (CHD), to ensure that services for people with CHD are pr ovided in a way that achieves the highest possible quality within the available resources. Actions r equired by Board Members: To note the proposals for conducting a review of congenital heart disease services 1222 New review of congenital heart services Summary Following the outcome of judicial review, the report by the Independent Reconfiguration Panel (IRP) and the Secretary of State's announcements relating to the safe and sustainable review of children's congenital heart services, NHS Englan d is no w the responsible body for taking forward the process. A new review is now being established to consider the whole lifetime pathway of care for people with congenital heart disease ( CHD). The ambition of this review is to ensure that services for people with CHD are provided in a way that achieves the highest possible quality within the available resources: the best outcomes for all patients, not just lowest mortality but reduced disability and an improved opportunity for survivors to lead better lives. tackling variation so that services across the country consistently meet demanding performance standards and are able to offer resilient 24/7 care great patient experience, which includes how information is provided to patients and their families, considerations of access and support for families when they have to be away from home We recognise that continued uncertainty is a risk to the service and unsettling for patients. We must therefore set ourselves the target of delivering the new review at pace. But we know that speed cannot be an excuse for imposing a top down solution or for running a process where people feel excluded from the real discussions, so we will be setting ourselves the additional challenge of achieving new levels of transparency and the highest levels of genuine participation. We know that this will need a new approach. We want to make sure that as well as mobilising NHS England's resources from right across the organisation, that we also work closely with partners and stakeholders to desi gn the way forward. By the end of September we will have established the new programme, co-design ed a process for the work going forward and undertaken initial work on how to secure high quality resilient services. By June 2014 working closely with stakeholders, we will have developed, tested and revised a proposition, undertaken work to identify a preferred approach to implementation , and completed the necessary preparatory work. Background 1. Around eight out of every 1,000 babies have some form of congenital heart disease (CHD) - around 5,800 babies in 2011. The number of children born with CHD is expected to rise, as the birth rate rises. As technology and expertise continue to develop, it is possible to do more than ever before to improve their lives, so that more children with CHD are surviving to adulthood. 2. NHS cardiac surgery for children is currently provided by 10 hospitals in England. Specialist paediatric cardiology is also provided by a further three centres . Arou nd 3,700 paediatric surgical procedures and 2,000 paediatric cardiology procedures are carried out each year . 1233 3. A recommendation for the concentration of medical and nursing expertise in a smaller number of centres of excellence was made as far back as 2001, in the report of the public inquiry into children's heart surgery at the Bristol Royal Infirmary. Since that time, there have been major improvements in outcomes, so that analysis of risk adjusted mortality for 2009-12, published this year by the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research (NICOR), shows that no surgical unit has a mortality rate significantly above the \"expected\" rate, and on this evidence (for example, mortality rates alone) services are currently \"safe\". 4. For adults, around 850 surgical procedures and 1,600 interventional cardiology procedures are carried out each year and reported to NICOR by 25 hospitals in England, however a further 10 hospitals have undertaken procedures in recent years but not provided data to NICOR. The safe and sustainable review 5. The safe and sustainable review was established in 2008, with a view to recon figuring surgical services for children with CHD. Taking into consideration concerns that surgeons and resources may be spread too thinly across the centres, the review considered whether expertise would be better concentrated in fewer sites. 6. At the end of the four year programme, in July 2012, a joint committee of Primary Care Trusts (JCPCT) made a series of decisions on the future of children's congenital heart services in England, covering: the development of congenital heart networks, service standards, improving the collection, reporting and analysis of outcome data, and the configuration of surgical services, which would have reduced the number of centres providing children's heart surgery from ten to seven, with surgery ceasing at Leeds, Leicester and the Royal Brompton. 7. The decision regarding configuration resulted in two separate challenges: a judicial review (JR), and referrals to the Secretary of State, who in turn asked the Independent Reconfiguration Panel (IRP) to consider the JCPCT findings. 8. The JR was decided on 7 March 2013, when the High Court declared that both the consultation process and the decision making process of the JCPCT were unlawful and quashed the decision to reconfigure surgical services. The judgement was based on a narrow point of process and the Court recognised \"the compelling and urgent clinical case for the reform of existing paediatric congenital cardiac services\" stating that the judgment should not be \"construed as advocating a need to return to the start of the consultation process\". Following legal advice, NHS England initially sought leave to appeal this decision but - in the light of the IRP's report and the Secretary of State's response (see below) - has since withdrawn this request. 9. The IRP were of the view that children and adults with CHD in England and Wales would benefit from services commissioned to national standards for the whole pathway of their care. They agreed that congenital cardiac surgery and interventional cardiology should only be provided by specialist teams large 1244 enough to sustain a comprehensive range of interventions, round the clock care, training and research. However, the IRP concluded that the JCPCT's decisions were based on \"flawed analysis of incomplete proposals and their health impact, leaving too many questions about sustainability unanswered and to be dealt with as implementation risks\" . Addressing the IRP findings 10. On 12 June 2013 the Secretary of State announced in Parliament that he accepted the IRP's advice, and that \"the [Safe and Sustainable] proposals canno t go ahead in their current form\". He went on to say that \"it is right we continue with this process, albeit in a different way\" and that \"NHS England now must move forward on the basis of these clear recommendations\". 11. The IRP's report highlighted the need to align the review of children's CHD services with ongoing work to consider the provision of adults' CHD services. Since the same surgeons operate on the same patients at different times in their lives, there are considerable dependencies between adults' and children's services, especially in the availability of surgical teams to provide 24/7 cover. 12. The IRP were also concerned that the while the Safe and Sustainable process received 75,000 responses to its public consultation, some stakeholders were nonetheless left feeling that their views were not fully heard or understood, or that they were not given all the information they needed to contribute fully. This in turn created, for some, the perception of a pre-determined outcome. 13. The IRP's report called for NHS England to develop a strategic framework for commissioning that reflects the complex interdependencies between specialised services provision and population need as a context within which any decisions about congenital heart services should be taken. 14. Importantly, neither the Courts, nor SofS nor IRP have questioned the need for cha nge to ensure the resilience, sustainability and excellence of these services. The challenge for NHS England 15. The challenge for NHS England is how to ensure that services for people with congenital heart disease are provided in a way that achieves the highest possible quality, within the available resources, now and for future generations: Securing the best outcomes for all patients, not just lowest mortality but reduced disability and an improved opportunity for survivors to lead better lives. Tackling variation so that services across the country consistently meet demanding performance standards and are able to offer resilient 24/7 care Delivering great patient experience, which includes how information is provided to patients and their families, considerations of access and support for families when they have to be away from home 16. To do this, we need to develop a process which is as transparent and inclusive as it can be, particularly in the use of evidence and data. Almost as important as the thoroughness of our work will be the need to be seen to be engaging as widely as possible, bringing patients, clinicians and their representatives together 1255 in the joint pursuit of an effective and equitable solution, in the interests of all service users now and in the future. What we do for CHD services will in some ways be seen as a template for whether and how NHS England undertakes other major service change in future. 17. It is widely acknowledged that the uncertainty which has been caused by recent developments is one of the greatest risks to the current delivery of the service. Patients and families are now unsure about precisely where and how they will receive treatment. Surgical centres are hamstrung in their planning, and recruitment and retention is made more difficult by the lack of a clear service model. This in turn creates a risk that the safety and quality of services may not be able to be maintained, that service levels could reduce or there could be unplanned closure(s). Charities, clinicians and other stakeholders gave a huge commitment to support change; many say they are demoralised, frustrated, exhausted and angry . Some doubt that there is the will to make the necessary changes happen. 18. These concerns need to be addressed as part of the new process. To support this measures designed to give commissioners early warning of any emerging concerns at units providing children's congenital heart services will be rolled out across the country, (and to adapt it to include adult services) accepting that it is still a developmental approach, and used as the basis of regular conversations between area teams and providers. A system will be established to ensure that aggregated information is regularly provided to the board committee. 19. In the light of all this, NHS England must bring forward an implementable solution within a year, ie by the end of June 2014. Given the complexity of the issues, the enlarged scope (children AND adults), the legitimate but differing views of stakeholders, and the need to build as much consensus wherever possible (in circumstances where some of the relationships have been badly bruised) this is a demanding but important ambition. We simply cannot re-run the previous process and hope to achieve a different outcome in a quarter of the time. 20. Instead, we must find ways to do this differently. As the sole national commissioner of specialised services NHS England has an opportunity not open to our predecessors. This creates a significant opportunity to drive service improvement including reduced variation in access and quality. We can focus on national standards for a national service, commissioned through a single model which enables us to drive change in the interests of patients. Principles / Approach 21. We propose the following principles and approach: Patients come first : the new review must have patients and their families at its heart, with a relentless focus on the best outcomes now and for the future. That aim over-rides organisational boundaries. Retaining what was good from earlier work : although the JCPCT's decision on configuration of children's congenital heart services has been overturned, much else was developed as part of that process and the subsequent implementation programme including a model of care, service standards, and well-developed thinking about network working. Similarly standards for adult services have also been developed and a re ready for 1266 formal consultation. This work has had extensive clinical and patient input and has the potential to be applicable to whatever service configuration is decided. Therefore NHS England must work with stakeholders to determine how much of this work can be retained. Transparency and participation : NHS England is committed to openness, transparency and participation. We should work with user, clinical and organisational stakeholders to ensure that we develop an approach to take the work forward that is true to those values. Our work should be grounded in standards, rigour, honesty and transparency. Evidence : the IRP reflected criticism of the way in which Safe and Sustainable used evidence to support its conclusions. The new review will need to be clear about the nature and limitations of the available evidence, and about any intention to rely on expert opinion in the absence of evidence. Notwithstanding the comment above about \"retaining what was good\", we must have no preconceived notions about the outcome. Wherever there is an assumption it must be made explicit, and justified. 22. We have not attempted to develop a full plan describing how the work will be taken forward, because we want to take time to understand from stakeholders what was good and should be retained from the previous process and what did not work well. We believe however that it is likely that a standards driven process - developing, testing, adopting and applying best practice standards for every part of the pathway - has much to commend it, and we will be testing this with stakeholders. Governance 23. The Board has established a committee which will provide formal governance of this work. The committee is chaired by Sir Malcolm Grant, Board Chairman, and includes Margaret Casely-Hayford and Ed Smith (non-executive directors), Sir Bruce Keogh (Medical Director), and Bill McCarthy (National Director for Policy). To support the committee, arrangements will be put in place for clinical, organisational and service user representation. 24. Bill McCarthy is the senior responsible officer for this work. John Holden (Director of System Policy) will co-ordinate the work within NHS England and ensure the full involvement of the many different stakeholders. Stakeholder engagement and communications 25. We are drawing up a stakeholder engagement plan, based on how these stakeholders tell us they wish to be involved, and identifying the different groups, their preferred channels of communication and the key messages throughout the process. For example we know that some of the existing surgical centres have well established patient groups and using these channels may be one way to reach the majority of those most directly affected. For patients, families and their representatives we have sought expert external help from three charities - National Voices, Involve and Centre for Public Scrutiny (CFPS) - to help us design and implement effective and appropriate engagement. They can also 1277 help us manage our risks (eg CFPS are experienced in working with oversight and scrutiny committees and can help us better understand the local government dimension). Due to their limited size these bodies are unable to be directly involved in the work but all have agreed to act in a mentoring capacity. For clinicians, Sir Bruce is convening a clinical advisory panel which will guide him throughout the process and will help design broader clinical engagement and address specific issues which may arise. He has identified the need for some international perspective on this work and will take some soundings from his international peers to determine how best international advice is provided. 26. Our communications will be as open and as often as possible - we have already initiated a fortnightly blog on the NHS England website where we will trail forthcoming meetings and provide a summary of recent progress and discussions. With the support of the NHS England Director of Communications and his team, we are also considering the potential for dedicated web pages, or other IT applications which allow documents and other information to be freely exchanged. We want to give anyone who is interested a simple and easy to use way to find out what is going on and to become involved. We will use social media as appropriate - and if our stakeholders find it helpful - to discuss and share information. We are also considering how we can address the needs of those who do not have access to the internet or do not use English as a first language. Resources 27. We need to take this opportunity to review the resourcing of this work. It will be important to ensure that it is a priority for the whole organisation and that the resources of the whole organisation are appropriately mobilised to support the work. The cost of dedicated programme management and administrative support will be met from recycling funds previously reserved for the Safe and Sustainable process. The estimated annual cost of this support is \u00a3500k. Conclusion 28. As the body responsible for commissioning specialised congenital heart services, NHS England is setting out ambitious plans to ensure that services for people with CHD are provided in a way that achieves the highest possible quality within the available resources. To achieve this, a new Congenital Heart review is being established to consider the whole lifetime pathway of care for people with CHD. The Board is asked to consider and comment on the proposed approach. Bill McCarthy National Director: Policy July 2013 1288 Annex 1: Programme Plan Our indicative timetable is follows: Phase 1 - up to October 2013 Co-design a process for the work going forward Take advice from external experts to help shape listening exercise [done] Review previous stakeholder input in order not to lose what has already been achieved; and check its continuing relevance with stakeholders [under way] Begin communications as per stakeholders preferences, eg blog, shared resources on webpage/sharepoint [under way] Agree approaches to participation, identify preferred communications channels Establish the programme Establish governance, advisory and stakeholder arrangements [under way] Develop programme plan, update Board, secure agreement, update Secretary of State [under way] Identify resources [underway] Initial work on how to achieve programme aims of higher quality services Agree with stakeholders what should be taken forward from previous processes Complete work on proposed paediatric cardiology standards [underway] Bring together adult and children's standards and agree process for approval and adoption [underway] Develop proposals for testing/implementing formal network arrangements [underway] Work with stakeholders to identify any fixed points and how these would influence service design. This is likely to include (but not be limited to) discussion of the provision of transplant services, the need for children's heart surgery and other tertiary paediatrics to be provided on the same site, and the need for children's and adults' surgery (and interventional cardiology) to be provided in close proximity Develop a \"proposition\" - not a list of sites, but a straw man of what a high quality and sustainable service looks like for adults and children, unconstrained by current configuration - the optimal model Consider and weigh, with legal advice, possible approaches for a managed process to translate these fixed points into firm proposals for structuring services, test with stakeholders, outline agreed process Establish the required capacity of the service in future years Set an ambitious timeline to have completed the work and be ready to implement. Phase 2 - up to February 2014 Develop, test and revise the proposition Using multiple channels, including local and national clinically led events, engage on the clinical appropriateness and user acceptability of the proposition 1299 Benchmark existing provision against the proposition - considering access as well as service quality Test any emerging alternative proposals Review dependencies - eg for children, neonatal and paediatric intensive care (PICU) and retrieval services, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). While the IRP recommended that decisions about the future of transplant services and respiratory ECMO should be contingent on final proposals for congenital heart services, in practice the level of interdependency may mean that they need to be considered together Weigh alternative implementation approaches: early thinking suggests that some fixed points could constitute 'hurdle criteria' for potential providers within a commissioner led standards driven approach, however alternative approaches need to be considered including option appraisal and designation and provider led regional solutions. Agree revised proposition with clinical and patient groups Phase 3 - up to June 2014 Preparation for implementation Work in this phase will of course be dependent on the nature of the proposition developed and the measure of agreement with that approach. If the solution is for a national plan in which current centres continue/cease to provide surgery, then - subject to legal advice - there may need to be further full for mal consultation. This could take the timeline for implementation beyond one year. If the solution is a commissioning approach to enforce a set of national standards which invites providers to cooperate to provide the service, any consultation could be undertaken sub-nationally as part of the development of tenders. Assuming local resolution and provider cooperation, the focus of this period would be on developing the tender exercise. 130 New Congenital Heart Disease Review Board Task and Finish Group Terms of Reference 1312 Information Reader Box Directorate Medical Commissioning Operations Nursing Commissioning Strategy Patients & Information Transformation and Corporate Operations Finance Document Purpose To describe the terms of reference of the New Congenital Heart Disease Review Board Task and Finish Group Document Name New Congenital Heart Disease Review Board Task and Finish Group Terms of Reference Author NHS England, Commissioning Strategy Directorate Target Audience General Additional Circulation List Website; Intranet Description Terms of Reference Cross Reference n/a Superseded Document n/a Action Required As described Timing/Deadlines See programme plan Contact Details (for further information) Jennie Smith, Programme Co-ordinator england.congenitalheart@nhs.net NHS England Quarry Direct Line: 0113 8248232 Document Status This is a controlled document.

Implementation will be planned and coordinated nationally, initially on behalf of NHS specialised commissioners, and from April 2013, on behalf of the NHS Commissioning Board. The JCPCT decision included establishing a number of congenital heart networks in England including the development of District Children's Cardiology Services and Children's Cardiology Centres 'for which standards will need to be developed' . This document sets out the Terms of Reference for the Clinical Implementation Advisory Group Standards Sub-group . Programme Scope Improving the quality of care of children with suspected or diagnosed congenital heart disease, from the pre-natal period (including care of women whose unborn child has suspected or confirmed congenital heart disease) , through infancy, childhood and through transition to transfer into adult services Establishing seven children's congenital heart networks that cover the whole population of England and Wales Developing standards for Children's Cardiology Centres and District Children's Cardiology Services and commissioning these services as required in each network Ensuring the application of quality standards covering network working and the whole care pathway from prenatal screening and services through transition to transfer to adult services Commissioning of heart surgical services for children, that meet the specified quality standards, from the seven designated providers Decommissioning of heart surgical services for children from the four providers that were not designated Implementing new systems to improve the collection, analysis and reporting of outcome data 149Standards Sub-group Terms o f Reference - v 1.1 - 21.06.13 Designating Birmingham Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust as a nationally commissioned provider of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) services for children with respiratory failure in place of the unit at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust The programme initiation document (PID) gives full details of programme scope (including what is not in scope), dependencies and linkages. Programme Objectives To ensure that: 1. Excellent care with a focus on the child and their family will be achieved by developing standards of care for the whole patient pathway from the pre-natal period (including care of women whose unborn child has suspected or confirmed congenital heart disease) through infancy, childhood and through transition to transfer into adult services, implemented through commissioning and monitored and managed by the networks. 2. Seven managed children's congenital heart networks are established covering the whole population of England, each with a specialist surgical centre. 3. The new model of care including local and regional cardiology services for children with congenital heart disease and a reduced number of specialist surgical centres is established. 4. Nationally commissioned ECMO services for children with respiratory failure are provided by Birmingham Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in place of University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust. 5. Transition to the new system is managed safely and efficiently, and in such a way as to realise the benefits described in the PID, and clinical interdependencies and linkages are managed. Sub-group purpose To describe generic referral pathways for children with suspected congenital heart disease To describe the core service offering for: District Children's Cardiology Services (DCCS) Children's Cardiology Centres (CCC) To develop standards for cardiology services, building on the Safe and Sustainable standards across all settings including Specialist Surgical Centres, Children's Cardiology Centres and District Children's Cardiology Services. To advise commissioners on the development of processes of self-assessment and peer review of services against the standards. 150Standards Sub-group Terms o f Reference - v 1.1 - 21.06.13 Sub-group deliverables A paper describing the minimum service offering for DCCSs and CCCs, and referral pathways into and onwards from these services. A document setting out standards document for cardiology services, across all settings including SSCs, CCCs and DCCSs. A paper setting out proposals for self-assessment and peer review processes for DCCSs and CCCs.

To tackle variation so that services across the country consistently meet demanding performance standards and are able to offer resilient 24/7 care. To ensure great patient experience, which includes how information is provided to patients and their families, considerations of access and support for families when they have to be away from home. 2.3 The Clinical Advisory Panel has been convened to provide a full range of clinical advice and recommendations on all aspects of the new congenital heart disease review to the NHS England National Medical Director and to the NHS England Board, the Board Task and Finish Group and the Programme Board. 2.4 The constitution of the Panel ensures a broad and strategic perspective, from across a wide range of specialties as well as an international perspective, allowing the review to benefit from expertise, not limited only to congenital heart disease, but the broader system and the challenges of delivering clinical services . 3 Role and Responsibilities 3.1 The role of the Clinical Advisory Panel is as follows : To advise on how the programme should achieve the best clinical outcome for patients, and tackles variation so that services across the country consistently meet demanding performance standards and offer resilient 24/7 care. 1586 To advise on the metrics and information systems needed by NHS England as commissioners: o To measure outcomes (mortality, disabi lity and quality of life). o To drive improvement. o To monitor the safety and quality of services . To advise on the evaluation of the work of the review. To support the National Medical Director in the design and implement ation of an effective approach to clinical engagement. To advise on all clinical aspects of the programme including providing expert opinion on a range of specific issues, including quality assurance of supporting work. To provide clinical leadership to the prog ramme, facilitate clinical discussions and to act as advocates for the programme. To advise on clinical workforce and training issues. To advise on how to align leading edge research and clinical practice. 3.2 The clinical advisory panel will have regard for the views of the clinical reference groups, the clinicians' group and the patient and public group. 4 Membership 4.1 The Chair and Members are appointed by the National Medical Director and the Chair has particular responsibility for providing effective leadership. 4.2 The Chair of the panel and the National Medical Director will nominate a Vice Chair from among the members, responsible for chairing the Panel meetings and providing leadership if the Chair is unavoidably absent or is not able to chair the meeting due to conflict of interest for specific items on the agenda. 4.3 The National Medical Director has advised that it is not intended that the Panel have a representative from every conceivable profession, speciality or geography. The programme has other means of achieving that (through the clinician group and the Clinical Reference Groups). Rather Panel members are asked to bring their professional experience and knowledge, but act in the wider interests of the service. 4.4 Members are selected for their personal expertise even when they may also be affiliated to specific stakeholder groups. As such they are appointed as individuals 1597 to fulfil their role on the panel and it is expected that in their role as a member they will act in the public interest. 4.5 Core membership Professor Sir Michael Rawlins, President, Royal Society of Medicine (Chair) ; Mr Graham Cooper, Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery ; Professor John Deanfield, Chair of Adult with Congenit al Heart Disease Advisory Group; Professor Deirdre Kelly, Chair of the review's Clinician Group; R ob Martin, British Congenital Cardiac Association Dr Andy Mitchell, Regional Medical Director (London), (NHS England); Professor Pedro del Nido, International Advisor; Mr James Palmer, National Clinical Director for Specialised Services (NHS England); Dr Tony Salmon, Chair of the review's Standards Sub Group; Fiona Smith, Royal College of Nursing; Professor Terence Stephenson, Academy of Medical Royal Colleges; Graham Stuart, Chair of the Clinical Reference Group for Congenital Heart Services Dr J-P van Besouw, The Royal College of Anaesthetists ; Professor Peter Weissberg, Chair of the review's Patient and P ublic Group; Professor Norman Williams, Royal College of Surgeons ; 4.6 The meeting will be quorate if 10 members are present. 4.7 Additional attendees The additional attendance at the meetings is as follows: Secretariat. 1608 5 Frequency 5.1 The Clinical Advisory Panel meeting will be held every two months and on such occasions as the Chair shall deem necessary.

A rapid review Turner J, Preston L, Booth A, O'Keeffe C, Campbell F, Jesurasa A, Cooper K, Goyder E* School for Health and Related Research (ScHARR), University of Sheffield, UK *Corresponding Author e.goyder@sheffield.ac.uk Background : The purpose of this rapid evidence synthesis is to support the current NHS England s ervice review on organisation of services for Congenital Heart Disease (CHD). The e vidence synthesis team was asked to examine the evidence on relationships between orga nisational features and patient outcomes in CHD services, and specifically, a ny re lationship between (1) volume of cases and patient outcomes and (2) proximity of co- located se rvices and patient outcomes. A systematic review published in 2009 had confirmed the ex istence of this relationship but cautioned this was not sufficient to make recommendations on the size of units needed. Ob jectives : To identify and synthesise the evidence on the relationship between organisational features and patient outcomes for adults and children with congenital heart disease. Data sources : A systematic search of medical and health related databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and Web of Science) was undertaken for 2009 - 2014 together with citation searching, reference list checking and stakeholder recommendations of evidence from 2003-2014. Re view methods : This was a rapid review so application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria to retrieved records was undertaken by one reviewer, with 10% double checked. Five review ers extracted data from included studies using a bespoke data extraction form then used for evidence synthesis. No formal quality assessment was undertaken but the usefulness of the evidence was assessed together with limitations identified by study authors. 169\u00a9 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

No UK studies were identified and 36/39 (92.4%) only included outcomes for paediatric patients. Thirty two (82%) investigated the re lationship between volume and mortality and 7 (18%) other service factors or outcomes. 90% were from the USA, 92.4% were multicentre studies and all were retrospective observational studies. Twenty five studies (64%) included all CHD conditions and 14 (36%) single c onditions or procedures. Although the evidence does demonstrate a relationship between volume and outcome in the majority of studies, this relationship is not consistent. The relationship was stronger for single complex conditions or procedures. A mixed picture emerged revealing a range of factors as well as volume that influence outcome including condit ion severity, individual centre and surgeon effects and clinical advances over time. We found limited (7 studies) evidence about the impact of proximity and co-location of services on outcomes and about volume on non-mortality outcomes. Lim itations : This was a rapid review that followed standard methods to ensure transparen cy a nd reproducibility. The main limitations of the included studies were the retrospective nature, reliance on routine datasets, completeness and selection bias and lack of data on key clinical and service processes. Conclusions : This review identified a substantial number of studies reporting a positive relationship between volume and outcome, but the complexity of the evidence requires careful interpretation. The heterogeneity of findings from observational studies suggests that, whils t a relationship between volume and outcome exists, this is unlikely to be a simple, independe nt and directly causal relationship. The effect of volume on outcome relative to the eff ect of other as yet undetermined health system factors remains a complex and unresolved research question.

The purpose of the evidence synthesis is to support the ongoing service review about how these services should be best organised. Prior work for the service review referred to a 2009 literature review which confirmed a relationship between volume and patient outcomes in CHD and highlighted the contributory effects of other system and process factors to this relationship. This rapid evidence synthesis has reassessed and updated the evidence base to examine what evidence there is for a relationship between organisational features and patient outcomes in CHD services. Objectives This rapid review focuss es on two key organisational features - volume and proximity. The rationale for this is based on the hypothesis that there may be a relationship between the volume of CHD procedures (both by institution and by surgeon) and patient outcomes and the clinical conjecture that reconfiguration which includes the co-location (or increased prox imity) of specialist services may be related to better patient outcomes. The research questions also reflect the view that mediating factors influence the relationship between pati ent outcomes and volume and proximity. The research questions are as follows: What is the current evidence for the relationship between institutional and surgeon volume and patient outcomes and how is that relationship influenced by complexity of procedure and by patient case mix? How are patient outcomes influenced by proximity to/co-location with other specialist clinical services (e.g. co-location of services such as specialist cardiac paediatric intensive care)? 178 xii Metho ds The rapid review was undertaken in twelve weeks. Our review aimed to identify key evidence of relevance to the review question and to extract and synthesise this evidence in a transparent and reproducible manner. A range of search methods was used to identify English langu age, peer reviewed evidence from 2003-2014 to address the research questions. Search methods inc luded database searches, citation searches, evidence from topic experts and scrutiny of reference lists from key reviews and included evidence. Assessment of the search result s according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria was undertaken by one reviewer and a 10% random sample checked by a second reviewer according to a pre-defined set of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data extraction was undertaken in Excel using a purpose- specific data extraction form developed iteratively and tested extensively for this rapid review . Formal quality assessment was not undertaken; instead the usefulness of included studi es to answering the review question and the generic and study specific limitations reported by study authors were critically assessed. Data were extracted and then tabulated in MSWord. Due to both the clinical and methodological heterogeneity of the included studies, a meta-analysis was not undertaken. Results A total of 39 studies were included in the review. Our database searches identified 2256 refe rences from which 19 papers were included in the review. Supplementary search methods were used extensively. An additional 20 papers included in the review were identified via cit ation searching (2 papers), reference lists of published reviews (15 papers) and reference lists of included papers (3 papers). No UK studies were identified and 36/39 (92.4%) only included outcomes for paediatric patients. Of the 39 included studies, 32 (82%) investigated the relationship between volume a nd mortality and 7 (18%) the relationships between other service factors and outcome or between volume and non-mortality outcomes. Eighteen of the 32 studies investigating the volume-mortality relationship included all CHD conditions and 14 focused on specific single or complex conditions and procedures. Thirty one of the 37 studies (84%) that used mortality as the pr imary outcome measured in-hospital mortality. Only 10 (27%) of the included studies measur ed mortality after discharge from hospital. Thirty five studies (90%) were from the USA, 92.4% were multicentre studies and all were retrospective observational studies. 179\u00a9 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Studies on single c onditions or procedures were more likely to identify an effect of volume on mortality but these were focused on high risk conditions, such as Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome, and pr ocedures, for example Norwood procedure. Even within these highly selected groups there was considerable variation in effect depending on procedure type and individual centre performance. It is possible that, for example, surgeon volume may be as important as centre volume for these complex cases. This updated and extended review confirms a pattern of studie s supporting the existence of a volume and outcome relationship. The findings from studies that did consider broader CHD populations were more equivocal. In some studies where an effect was identified, the effect was weak or only demonstrable for specific subgroups of patients. Overall, there was no clear indication that the evidence for the volume and mortality relationship was substantially stronger than the evidence for a no effect relationship in this group. The findings further highlight the complex relationship between volum e and outcome and the range of other factors which also have an effect. Some of these, such as condition severity, are well established but the effect of association of processes, systems and individual clinical effects on outcome remain unknown. We also included evidence from three studies on adult CHD of which one, that included transpl ant patients for a range of conditions in addition to CHD, was of limited value. The other two studies explored the effect of surgeon type in relation to outcome. Both studies found that a dult CHD patients had better outcomes when operated on by paediatric surgeons in specialist children's centres. We found limited evidence on the effects of proximity of other services on mortality or the impact of volume on non-mortality outcomes. There appears to be relatively little evidence from studies that attempt to measure the effect of related processes on outcome and this is an area for future development. Some key themes emerged from our analysis. 180 xiv 1. There are a range of factors which influence mortality in CHD and centre volume is only one of them. Our data extraction identified 67 different variables used to adjust f or risk in the included studies and the most influential risk factor for mortali ty is the severity of the condition. 2. Medicine moves forward and clinical advances, training, increasing expertise and changes in service provision mean outcomes for CHD have also changed ove r time. Five studies that analysed data over long time periods (approximately 10 ye ars) measured changes in mortality over time and found that, irrespective of other factors including volume, mortality decreased over this time period. This occurred despit e increasing complexity thus attesting to ongoing clinical improvement. This means the relevance of findings from historical data to contemporary services needs to be carefully considered. 3. Although aggregated data may show a difference in mortality rates between low and high volume centres, such aggregation may mask between-centre variation. Several included studies identified variation between centres with some low or medium volume centres performing equally as well as those with high volume. Such variation indicates that individual centre effects relating to training, management protocols, e xpertise and availability of services are also likely to influence outcomes. 4. The evidence base available to guide UK decisions on service design and configuration for CHD is dominated by retrospective studies conducted within the USA and many of the studies have analysed centres with very small volumes of cases . The extent to which the reported findings are generalisable and relevant to the UK setting is therefore limited. The organisation of services in the USA is very different to the UK and other countries where there has already been a degree of centralisation of CHD services. With centralisation comes a corresponding increase in volume as more cases are concentrated in fewer centres. It remains unclear whether the impact of volume on outcome is largely a consequence of higher volume units organising and providing a complex servic e with all the \"right\" components, or whether it remains an independent factor directly related to the advantages of dealing with a larger number of cases. The lack of any UK studies to contribute to the review indicates a serious gap in evidence relevant to service provision in the NHS. 5. Despite the growing number of studies few studies have suggested what the op timum size of a CHD centre in terms of volume should be.

Limitations This was a rapid review with limited second sifting and a modified quality appraisal that followed st andard methods to ensure it was transparent and reproducible. Many authors of studies included in the review take great care to point out the methodologica l limitations of their studies and caution against over-interpretation of their findings. Included studies are predominantly retrospective and observational in nature. Such design features make it very problematic when trying to establish a direct inverse relationship of cause (volume) to effect (mortality). All but 5 of the included studies used routine datasets as the source data including administrative, registry and voluntary datasets. With this comes consequent risks to data quality such as completeness, accuracy and selection bias. These sources also lack the data on key clinical and service processes needed to explain the associated effects of factors other than volume on outcome. The insights gained from study reports of a single condition or surgical procedure are important for an understanding of those conditions. Typically such reports bear little relation to overall surgical volume and therefore provide a limited contribution to the \"evidence\" that relates to optimal volumes for entire CHD services. It is increasingly recognised that certain methods of investigation and analysis are unsuit ed to investigation of the volume - outcome question. Even though considerable advances in methodological approaches (e.g. complexity stratification) continue to be made, questions about t he optimal configuration for volume/outcome debate remain unlikely to be resolved withi n the foreseeable future. This seems particularly the case given the absence of a comprehensive and accurate national database that provides sufficient information to account for risk, complexity and the effects of clinical care and service processes. Conclusions We have conducted a rapid review of the evidence on the relationship between volume and outcome and between other service factors and outcome for CHD. Overall, we found a substantial number of studies reporting a positive relationship between volume and 182 xvi outcome, particularly for highly complex cases. However, the complexity of the evidence re quires careful interpretation . A mixe d picture emerged from the 39 included studies which increases our understanding of the complexity of this relationship and highlights va riation in both methods and findings across individual studies, the potential effects of a range of other factors that may interact with volume and influence outcome and the methodological limitations imposed by the research approaches taken. Interpreting the evidence is particularly challenging due to a lack of information on clinical and service related processes in the literature. This lack of information means that the volume/outcome relationship is difficult to disentangle from other clinical and service processes and outcomes. A clear evidence gap remains to be addressed with regard to: better understanding of the relationships between the wide range of organisational factors in CHD services; how these ca n potentially predict a number of outcomes of relevance to patients and families, and the causal pathways between organisational factors and outcomes. It is these questions that need to be answered and this requires the development of comprehensive, high quality clinical and admi nistrative databases which collect information on a range of organisational factors and outcomes related to quality of care. There is scope to expand the existing NICOR database to c apture more of this information. There is a clear need to conduct robust UK based studies and an enhanced database could then be used to conduct observational studies of the relations hip between organisational factors, including volume, and outcomes that would have direc t relevance to the NHS. Future research efforts directed to these tasks would be of consi derable benefit to improving patient care for CHD. Word Count - 2012 183\u00a9 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

These problems need treatment during childhood and sometimes later when the y become adults and it is important that they are cared for in a hospital where they will g et the best possible specialist treatment for their condition. For our review, we were asked to look at whether the treatment that patients receive and what happens to them as a result of this treatment (outcomes) are influenced by features of th e hospital treating them. It is often thought that in hospitals where a lot of operations are done (both in the hospital and by individual surgeons), care for patients is better. It is also often thought that hospitals where key services are located together have better outcomes. We looked at published academic articles to provide th is information. We found 39 scientific studies that had investigated these features and analysed them to identify the key messages they contained. The main outcome studied was whether or not patients survived their surgery. Our review found that whilst many of the studies show better patient outcomes when larger volume s of surgery are performed, this was not consistent and not all of the studies showed this. Where studies showed that there was a relationship between better patient outcomes and larger volumes of surgery, it was not clear why larger volumes led to better outcomes. More research is needed to try and better understand what other aspects of service affect outcome. Word Count - 253 words 184185 \u00a9 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Background This rapid evidence synthesis has been written in response to a request by NHS England to further examine the evidence around the delivery of congenital heart disease (CHD) services. The purpose of the evidence synthesis is to support the ongoing NHS England service review about how C HD services should be best organised. Services for children with CHD have been the subject of scrutiny for a number of years. In 2012, following an extensive review as part of the \"Safe and Sustainable\" work programme, a series of recommendations were made for the reconfiguration of cardiac services for this patient group1. The rationale for change was based on the view that clinical expertise was spread too thinly and that providing CHD surgery in a smaller number of units would ensure a critical mass of cases, access to associated specialist staff and the ability to provide a safe 24/7 emergency service. At the time of the review CHD surgery for children was carried out in 11 centres. The \"Safe and Sustainable\" CHD review 1 recommended that CHD services be provided by 7 managed clinical networks centred around 7 units. However, these recommendations were challenged and subsequently the subject of a Judicial Review (JR) and an Independent Reconfiguration Panel (IRP) inquiry which concluded processes of the review were flawed. Conseq uently service reconfiguration was not implemented and these services are subject to a new r eview which will consider the whole lifetime pathway for CHD. The JR and IRP identified a number of issue s of concern with the \"Safe and Sustainable\" review process including the use and interpretation of the existing evidence base on surgical services for CHD and patient outcomes. In particular they questioned the reliance on evidence around the relationship between volume of cases and outcomes. A literature review underta ken in 2009 by Ewart 2 had examined this evidence in detail and, although confirming the existence of a relationship between volume and outcome, cautioned that this relationship alone w as not sufficient to make recommendations on the size of units needed. The review was not able to identify any reliable evidence on the cut off points in terms of the minimum annual numbers of cases needed for a centre. The author also highlighted that likely 186 2 contributory effects of other system and process factors on the relationship between volume and outcome in the published literature were unclear. As it is now almost 5 years since the Ewart review was published, it is timely to reassess the e vidence base for CHD services to support the current service review. The purpose of this evidence synthesis in the form of a rapid review is to ex amine what evidence there is for a relationship between organisational features and patient outcomes in CHD services. This rapid review of published research on the relationship between volume, proximity and patient outcomes is just one of the sources of evidence which has been commissioned to inform the NHS England CHD service review. The overall aim of th is service review is to ensure that services for people with congenital heart disease are provided in a way that achieves the highest possible quality within the available resources. This will involve consideration of a very wide range of types of evidence including published research, but also audit and other service quality-related data from CHD services and information based on the experiences of clinicians, patients and families. 187 \u00a9 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Hypotheses tested in the review (Research Questions) Due to the fact that this is a rapid review, the review is focussing on two key organisational features - volume and proximity. The rationale for this is based on the existing, evidence- based, consensus that there may be a relationship between the volume of CHD procedures (both by institution and by surgeon) and patient outcomes and the clinical consensus that reconfiguration which includes the co-location (or increased proximity) of specialist services may be related to better patient outcomes. The research questions also reflect the view that there are mediating factors that influence the relationship between patient outcomes and volume and proximity. The research questions are as follows: What is the current evidence for the relationship between institutional and surgeon volume and patient outcomes and how is that relationship influenced by complexity of procedure and by patient case mix? How are patient outcomes influenced by proximity to/colocation with other specialist clinical services (e.g. co-location of services such as specialist cardiac paediatric intensive care)? 188 4 Chapter 3. Review methods Rapid review methods Due to the need to complete this review within a very short timeframe (twelve weeks including a three week protocol development stage) rapid review methods were used to ensure the efficient identification and synthesis of the most relevant evidence. Rapid review methods are still in their relative infancy, in comparison to the more established systematic review. Harker and Kleijnen 3 examined a number of rapid reviews in order to develop understanding and definition of what a rapid review was. Rapid reviews are underta ken over a short time frame with a streamlined methodology. This streamlined methodology is a necessary compromise from a standard systematic review. Whilst they found considerable variation in the methodologies adopted by rapid reviews, acknowledging that ther e is not a \"one size fits all\" methodology, they advise \"clear and transparent description and discussion of methodology utilised and acknowledge any limitations\" (p.406). This advice has informed our choice of methods and report writing. Our review did not attempt to identify all relevant evidence or to search exhaustively for all evidence that meets the inclusion criteria; the search approach aim ed to identify the key evidence of most relevance to the review question. The scope to both search for and review 'related evidence' , reflecting the multiple dimensions of the topic, was considerable and thus was considered prohibitive within the timef rame given. The rapid review therefore focussed on the most relevant evidence from CHD services for children and adults. The rapid review was based on a proposed conceptual fra mework included in the study protocol. This allowed us to: Define the scope of the search strategy Define inclusion and exclusion criteria to specify what types of studies were to be included in the final report Construct summary tables of all included studies to present key information and findings 189 \u00a9 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

In addition, comments were sought from key stakeholders, who were part of the NHS England Clinical Advisory Panel for the Congenital Heart Disease review. The protocol development started on January 7th 2014 and was published on the NHS England website on February 10th 2014 4. Use of the conceptual framework There is an extensive health services research evidence base documenting associations between a range of organisational factors, particularly factors related to location, nature and size of specialist facilities and outcomes, in both elective and emergency service provision. There is also a major field of research that has explored, both quantitatively and qualitatively, the impact of different aspects of service organisation and delivery which influence patient safety and may reduce the risk of adverse outcomes for patients. In order to make the relations hip between this wider evidence base and the, relatively limited, scope of this commissioned rapid review more explicit, a logic model (or conceptual framework) was developed for the study protocol and this is included in Appendix One. This figure shows the relationship between the specific inclusion criteria for this review and the much wider context of factors of known relevance which were considered for inclusion in the review if there was releva nt data within the included studies. This approach was chosen based on the need to both limit the scope of the review to the most relevant evidence, while not ignoring the very wide range of organisational, cultural and patient-related factors already known to be important predictors of outcome. The conceptual model was used to inform the literature search, development of inclusion and exclusion criteria, data extraction and evidence synthesis. 190 6 Literature searching A range of search methods, as outlined below, were used in order to identify evidence to answe r the rapid review research questions in a timely fashion: Stage One - Search of health and medical databases. Stage Two - Citation searching. Stage Three - Call for evidence from topic experts. Stage Four - Scrutiny of reference lists published reviews/key evidence. Stage Five - Scrutiny of reference lists of included papers. The search process was undertaken with reference to the protocol, in particular the conceptualisation of the different subareas within which to identify relevant evidence. - Figure 1 Conceptualisation of the evidence base A systematic search of medical and health related databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and Web of Science) was undertaken for the years 2009 - 2014 together with citation searching, reference list checking and recommendations from stakeholders to identify evidence for 2003-2014. The rationale for limiting the review to 2003 -2014 was that this was in line with the dates used by Ewart and would limit the body of evidence to a manageable but meaningful number of studies. Stage One- Search of health and medical databases The starting point of our search strategy was Ewart 2. We modified search terms from th e previous review to capture a wider evidence base around the population (adults and children), V olume Proximity Paediatric V olume Proximity Adult 191 \u00a9 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

The search strategy used a combination of free-text and Medical Subject Headings (Me SH) and can be found in Appendix Two. The search was around key terms for the population (c ongenital heart disease), the intervening variables (volume and proximity) and outcomes (mortality, death, survival). We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE via OVID SP, Cochrane Library via Wiley Inte rscience, Web of Science via of Knowledge CINAHL via EBSCO. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library are commonly considered the core databases for identifying evidence relating to clinical topics 5. The search strategy was limited to 2009-2014 with the rationale that relevant evidence from 2003 -2008 would be cited in later papers or in later reviews retrieved by the database search and ther efore identified via Stages Two-Five. The searches were undertaken in January 2014 and an update search was undertaken in Marc h 2014. The search results were downloaded into Reference Manager where they were assessed for inclusion in the review. Additional detail on th is process is available later in the methods section. Stage Two - Citation searching A search was undertaken to identify any published articles that have cited any of the articles included in the Ewart review 2. This se arch was undertaken in Google Scholar, using the Publish or Perish software to manage the references identified. These references were then imported into Reference Manager. We also undertook citation searching using included papers in areas not included within the scope of the original Ewart review 2 (i.e. adult and paediatric proximity and adult volume). 192 8 Stage Three -Call for evidence from topic experts A c all for evidence for potential inclusion in the review was made via the NHS England Cong enital Heart Disease blog 4, directly at the NHS England Patient and Public group and via email to the NHS England Clinical Advisory panel. Evidence was forwarded to ScHARR via NHS England. Papers suggested by topic experts and the wider group of interested parties are listed in Appendix Two. Stage Four -Scrutiny of reference lists of published reviews/key evidence In o rder to identify additional published evidence that was not retrieved by the database searches, the team undertook scrutiny of reference lists of published reviews of services, guideline documents and reports as identified through Stages One, Two, Three and Five. Re views that informed this stage of the search are listed in Appendix Two. Stage Five - Scrutiny of reference lists of included papers Re ference lists of all papers identified for inclusion were examined. Any titles considered to be relevant were then scrutinised at abstract level via PubMed. Any relevant full papers were consi dered for inclusion by a reviewer. Where papers were identified for inclusion, their refe rence lists were subsequently checked. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria The inclusion of studies in the review was according to the following table: Table 1 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Criteria Inclusio n Exclusion Population Adults and children undergoing treatment (surgical or interventional) for congenital heart disease Intervention Measurement of o utcomes based 193 \u00a9 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Publish ed, peer reviewed evidence. Qualitative evidence. Evidence from surveys of views/experiences . Editorials . Opinions. N on-English -language papers . Non OECD countries. Assessment according to inclusion and exclusion criteria References identified from Stages One and Two were downloaded into Reference Manager Version 12 to be sifted for inclusion in the review. All potential titles were examined for inclusion by one reviewer. Any titles that did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded. Foll owing the examination at title level , any remaining references were scrutinised at abstract level. For any references where possible inclusion was unclear a second reviewer independently examined the corresponding full-text. Titles and abstracts of these citati ons identified by the searches were 10% checked by a second reviewer (and a check for consistency undertaken ). For Stages Three, Four and Five - References were checked following the same three stage process as for Stages One and Two (title, abstract, full text). Assessm ent for inclusion of conference abstracts identified from all stages of the search was underta ken by one reviewer and checked by a second. Both reviewers assessed each conference abstract based on three criteria, namely: 194 10 Whether the abstract fulfilled the inclusion criteria, in terms of the explanatory variables and outcomes. Whether the evidence in the abstract was already included within an already included pape r Whether there was sufficient data in the abstract to be able to use the data in a meaningful manner to address the aims of the review. Data extraction including development of the data extraction tool The aim of the data extraction process was to focus on the most critical information for evidence synthesis rather than exhaustively extracting and critiquing all available information within i ndividual papers. Due to the rapid nature of the review, data extraction was undertaken by five reviewers. A standa rdised data extraction form was developed using the following process. The initial draft of the data extraction tool was designed as a comprehensive way to capture all relevant information from the studies on a broad range of factors related to congenital heart disease services that may affect patient outcomes following interventions. Four members of the S cHARR review team tested this initial draft on three studies 6-8. It became apparent that these studies, which focussed on the relationship between volume and mortality, considered complexity of the underlying cardiac condition and other patient-level factors in their analysis, but did not include details of relevant organisational factors such as staffing and proximity of related services. Similarly mortality was the only outcome considered in these studies and other relevant outcomes such as morbidity, complications, length of stay and readmissions were not included. The data extraction tool was therefore revised in the light of this initial data extraction. The revisi on also included reference to data tables included in other reviews in this area; Ewart2 and Bazzani and Marcin8. The final layout was determined to explicitly include the following key details, in addition to the information included as standard on a data extraction form: Where data was obtained from a database, whether contribution to the database was voluntary (to indicate potential bias in reporting) and whether the purpose of 195 \u00a9 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

The covariates used in the analysis In the quantitative assessment of the relationship between volume/ proximity and mortali ty, a breakdown of the crude association and the adjusted association (for ca semix +/- other covariates). Where an association was identified, was the nature of this relationship (linear or non-linear)? A sample data extraction form is available in Appendix Three. Qua lity Assessment Rather than using a standard checklist approach, instead, the focus was on an assessment of the overa ll usefulness of the included evidence in answering the research questions. The a ssessment of usefulness was made based on a number of factors which included: Whether the study adjusted for severity of condition Whether the study adjusted for age Whether the study was multi-centre. Whether the study included more than one intervention/condition. Whether contribution to the database used to collect the data was voluntary and whether data was collected comprehensively or collectively. Assessment of the limitations of included studies was also undertaken using the limitations reported by study authors in the included studies. Synthesis Data were extracted and tabulated. This tabulation was used to inform the narrative synthesis in the Results section. A meta-analysis was not considered given that the review was a rapid review and there was considerable heterogeneity in the design, methods and setting of the included st udies making the clinical value of such a formal statistical analysis open to debate. 196 12 Chapter 4.

Four additional abstracts met the inclusion criteria, however the evidence included in them was already included in a full paper. Upon scrutiny, the information included in the abstracts was insufficient for full data extraction and could not be used in a meaningful manner to a ddress the aims of the review. Therefore a decision was made to data extract as much data as possible from these abstracts and include this information for reference in the report appendix but to not include this evidence in the analysis. The tables can be found in Appendix 3. Second screening of retrieved references In order to check the screening consistency of the single reviewer a second reviewer screened a pproximately 10% of the references (n=300). Reviewer 2 tagged as potential includes 5/292 (1%) references excluded by Reviewer 1, and tagged as probable excludes 1/8 (12.5%) references included by Reviewer 1. This gave a Kappa statistic of 0.77, generally acknowledged as good agreement. The three additional potential includes identified by Re viewer 2 were tenuous includes (two review articles potentially relevant as background, and an article for which only a title was available) while the one article tagged as \"include \" by Reviewer 1 and \"exclude\" by Reviewer 2 was subsequently checked for inclusion at the full text stage. Therefore it was unlikely that any relevant primary studies were overlooked in the 10% sample checked and this result can be extrapolated to the remainder of the screening process.

The majorit y of studies (90%) were conducted in the USA and most were multicentre (92.4%). We have classified included studies in to three broad groups - those where the primary objective was to explore the relationship between volume of service and mortality outcome for a range of CHD conditions (18/39); those where the focus was on the relationship between volume and mortality outcome for specific single conditions or procedures (14/39) and those where the focus was on the impact of a variable other than volume or where non- mortality outcomes only were reported (7/39). For studies involving specific conditions or procedures these were mainly complex conditions - such asHypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HL HS), pulmonary atresia and -/ or procedures including Norwood Procedure, arterial switch operation (ASO), transposition of only Ventricular Assist Devices (VAD) only (1/14). Two studi es included a paediatric CHD population as a subgroup in studies that examined a range of cardiothoracic procedures 38 28 and one a range of common paediatric operations 12. For these studies only the findings related to the CHD population are reported here. Three procedure based studies for heart transplant 10 16 and VAD 32 included patients with conditions other than CHD. The majority of studies used routine datasets (35/39) and of these voluntary clinical or mixed clinical and administrative data sources predominated (21/39) with 13 studies utilising involuntary administrative data. Descriptions of these datasets are provided in Appendix Four. Five studies used study specific data including one using data from a clinical trial 40. Half of the studies included children of all ages (age range 0-20), 14/39 included only ne wborns and infants and 3 studies included adults. 203 \u00a9 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

The use of routine data is reflected in the types of study design used. There were no primary clinical trials with retrospective observational designs being the predominant feature. There was one before and after study assessing the impact of a pae diatric cardiac intensive care unit 19.

Most of the included studies were conducted after 2009 (29/39, 64%) with 14 studies conducted before 2009. The latter included the seven studies included in the Ewart review 2 and a n additional seven studies identified as a consequence of our broader search strategy and inclusi on criteria to include adult studies and those concerned with non-mortality outcomes or the impac t of factors other than volume. Fifteen studies (38%) covered time periods of greater than five years. Just over half (8/14) of the studies for specific conditions or procedures, where case numbers will be smaller, utilised data from more than five years compared to 28% of studies where all conditions were included. Unsurprisingly there is a 206 22 marked difference in sample sizes between studies including all CHD conditions compared to those including highly selected populations based on single conditions or procedures and single centre studies. Where reported, there are also differences in the centre volumes with studies on specific conditions or procedures having lower volume thresholds. Within these 14 studies 9 included centres with 20 or fewer cases per year. For studies including all CHD cases 10/25 had centres with 200 or fewer cases per year and 5 of these had fewer than 100 ca ses per year including two studies with very low volume centres with less than 10 cases per year 41 28. The primary endpoint for measuring mortality outcome was within the post-operative period with 31/37 (84%) of studies reporting in hospital mortality. Seven studies measured mortality at 30 days and 4 up to one year. Study analyses - adjustment for confounders and risk The CHD population is highly complex and varied both in terms of the range of conditions it encompasses and the associated severity and risk of mortality for different conditions. Three CHD risk scores that take account of surgical complexity and associated risk of mortality have been developed- STS EACTS (Society of Thoracic Surgeons - European Assocation for Cardio Thoracic Surger y), RACHS 1 (Risk Adjusted Classification on Congenital Heart Surgery) and the Aristotle Complexity score - for risk adjustment in CHD. A detailed description of each score is provided in Appendix Four. Other risk scores do exist for CHD, but have not been used in the studies that have been included in the review. Outcome is also dependent on a range of patient, demographic and service factors that need to be taken into account in study analyses. We extracted details of all co-variates used in the analyses of each included study and identified 67 different types of co-variate (excluding subgroups within types). Thirty one (79%) of the studies included a co-variate that accounted in some way for condition. Of these 18 used a risk score for surgical complexity, 8 a condition descriptor, 3 a procedure descriptor and 2 an ICD-9-CM diagnostic code. Of other co- variates the most comm only used were age (18/39), co-morbidity (14/39), gender (13/39) and ethnicity (9/39). Some studies of highly selected groups of patients did not always adjust for common co- variates such as complexity (where a single condition was the subject) or age (where the study population were all neonates). 207 \u00a9 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Overview of main findings We have summarised the main findings of each included study in terms of whether a measurable effect of volume on mortality outcome was reported. Effect is defined as an inverse relationship between volume and mortality, that is, increasing volume results in decreasing mortality (or conversely low volume is associated with higher mortality). Where survival is reported the effect relationship is increasing survival with increasing volume and vice ve rsa.which both only reported unadjusted mortality for a subpopulation of newborns and infants undergoing open heart surgery in larger studies of a range of cardiothoracic procedures. Kazui 28 reported an inverse relationship between volume and mortality with higher mortality in low volume centres and Sakata 38found no relationship between volume and re lationship for the CHD subgroup. Both reported wide variation in mortality rates across all volumes and both concluded that risk adjusted measures are needed to explore this relationship more robustly. Relation ship between volume and mortality for all CHD conditions We identified 19 studies that examined the relationship between centre volume and mortality. A sing le centre study by Arenz 9 examined unit performance over four years using a composite measure including mortality but did not directly test the relationship between volume and mortality. Thirteen studies examined this relationship as the primary objective of the study , two examined the effect of adult CHD operative management in by paediatric se rvices or surgeon and two examined the relationship as part of a more general study to identify risk factors for mortality or surgical performance. One study examined the relationship between volume and mortality and the impact of specialist nursing skills. A summary of the findings is given in Table 6. Note that the estimates of effect size are not c omparable between studies due to different inclusion criteria (procedures, time periods, instit utions), different definitions for volume categories, different definitions for mortality outcomes and adjustment for different confounding factors.

Studies i dentifying predictors of mortality or other indirect measures Chang (2006) 7 no difference for post -discharge mortality] [Total mortality (in hospital and post discha rge) OR= 1.23, p<0.01 One risk factor for mortality examining a range of variables . Lower volume hospitals had higher mortality for all cases combined (in hospital and post discharge) but no difference in post discharge only deaths . Seifert (2007) 39 [highest v. lowest volume quartile -1.00, p=0.049 ] Main objective was to assess gender effect on mortality. Volume used as one of a number of co-variate s. Mortality lower in highest volume centres and may be one factor influencing outcome . 212 28 A number of studies detected no effect of volume on mortality. Oster 33 calculated standardised mortality rates from previous performance and found no strong effect with borderline significance for all cases and high risk cases and no effect for low risk cases and concluded it is whole hospital performance rather than volume that produces impact on outcome. Welke has conducted a series of studies examining the relationship between volume and morta lity. The earliest 44 study found no effect of volume on mortality although complexity increased and mortality decreased over the study period. The 2008 study6 found high volume hospitals performed better than other groups but complexity (RACHS-1) and age were better discriminators for mortality than volume which was only just significant (ROC curve area 0.5). This general relationship was repeated in the 2009 study 43 which found an inverse relationship between volume and mortality but this was only significant for high risk groups with no effect in low risk. The most recent study 42examined the threshold needed to detect changes in mortality as a consequence of differences in volume and found that mortality was too low or individual procedures too rare to detect the true relationship between volume and performance. Two studies included volume as a variable in broader studies designed to identify predictor s of mortality in CHD but were not designed to explore this relationship as a primary objective. Chang 7 analysed the effect of a range of variables and found no association between volume and mortality for post discharge deaths but an association when inhospital deaths are included , a nd that age and procedure type were better predictors of mortality risk. The objective of the study by Seifert 39 was to examine the influence of gender on outcome. Volume was used as a co-variate in the analyses and an association between volume and outcome was detected but this was one of a number of variables that were also associated with inc reased risk of mortality. Both of these studies highlight that volume is just one factor influencing outcome. Of studies reporting an effect of volume on outcome, Bazzani and Marcin 8 conducted a comprehensive set of analyses replicating four previous studies and developing a new model using a larger more contemporary dataset. A significant effect was found when volume was analysed as both a categorical and continuous variable with mortality decreasing for every 100 additional cases per year. However the effect detected was weaker than that reported in the previous studies and after sensitivity analysis in which the single highest volume hospital was removed the effect was reduced for the continuous analysis and disappeared for the 213 \u00a9 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Dinh & Maroulas 18 conducted a modelling study and found an inverse relationship between volume and mortality that held for both low and high risk patients in low and medium volume units and suggested this relationship was strong enough that it should be possible to identify a threshold for unit size.. The study by Gray 21 published in 2003 used data from a single year 10 years previously (1992). The study found no consistent relations hip between volume and outcome in 4 centres with variable rates in the 3 lower volume centres compared to the highest suggesting there is also a centre effect but the re levance to current services is questionable. Pasquali 35 conducted a complex set of analyses examining the relationship between volume and mortality and mortality in patients with complications. An effect was found in the relationship between volume and mortality in all patients and those with complications where the effect was stronger. There was no difference in complication rates between high and low volume centres but low volume centres had higher mortality in patients with complications suggesting high volume hospitals may be better at managing complications. Vinocur 41;50 analysed data from a 25 year period (1982 - 2007) and found an inverse relationship between volume and mortality for every 100 extra cases/year. However the study also found that mortality decreased 10 fold over this time period indicating improving care and that individual centre effect contributed more to the risk model than volume. A number of studies used data over time period of 10 years or more and whilst these remain of value in contributing to the evidence base it is also the case that over time there has been substantial change in the management of CHD so relevance to current service provision or performance needs to be considered when interpreting results. Two studi es examined the effect of managing adult CHD in paediatric services or by paediatric surgeons. The study by Karamlou 26 found adults operated on by paediatric heart surgeons had lower mortality rates than those operated on by non-paediatric heart surgeons a nd was also associated with surgeon volume. Kim 29 examined the relationship between volume and mortality for adults undergoing operation in paediatric centres. They found no effect of total CHD volume on mortality but did find an effect of lower mortality in centres that had volumes of adult cases. Relationship between volume and mortality for all selected conditions or procedures We identified 14 studies of the relationship between volume and mortality for selected conditions or procedures.

In general, these studies did demonstrate an effect of volume on mortality but the relationship is not straightforward. In 2 studies of HLHS palliation, Dean 17;51, found an effect for stage 1 palliation but not stage 2 and McHugh 30 also found the association between low volume and higher mortality was strongest for stage 1 with variable effects for stage 2 and 3. The study by Karamlou 27 looked at volume and outcome for 5 conditions and procedures and found the volume and outcome effect was only present for one group (TGA). Four of the six studies on Norwood procedure found an association between volume and mortality 15 23 24 34 and two found no association 27 40 although Tabbutt 40 did find that low volume was associated with higher morbidity and length of stay in hospital. A single study identifying risk factors for mortality after Blalock Taussig Shunt Procedure 36 found no relationship between volume and mortality with condition severity and weight being the most significant predictors for mortality. One of the advantages of using these highly selected and standardised patient groups is that the potential effects of other factors on outcome may also be identifiable. Indeed the findings of these studies highlight this complexity. Highly specialised and complex surgery requires clinical expertise. Four studies also measured the effect of individual surgeon volume. For Norwood procedure Hornik 24 reported decreasing mortality with increasing surgeon volume, Tabbutt 40found no effect of surgeon volume as did Checcia 15 although in the latter study it was ac knowledged that the number of cases per surgeon may be too small to detect an effect. Karamlou 27 found increasing surgeon volume improved outcome but only for TGA and not for other groups within that study. These studies also acknowledged the effect that individual institutions may have on mortality. The study by Karamlou 27 on 5 different but complex patient groups found that there was wide between centre variation in performance for the different conditions and that good performance for one condition was not necessarily translated to all conditions within a centre. McHugh 30 also identified substantial between centre variation and found that although overall there was an effect of higher mortality in low volume centres, there were also low and medium volume centres that were achieving good outcomes. Similarly the study by Pasquali 34 identifie d an effect of volume on outcome but volume only accounted for 14% of between 220 36 centre variation in risk of mortality indicating there are a range of other factors that are also having an impact. Included studies also demonstrate the potential effects of changes in clinical advances and service provision. The study by McHugh 30 used data over a 10 year period and a dichotomised analysis of early and late era surgery found mortality improved over time. There has also been a move to centralisation or regionalisation of services also reflected in these studies. The primary objective of the study by Berry 13 was to assess the impact of management at teaching versus non-teaching centres and found over a 3 year period that stag e 1 palliation surgery for HLHS in non-teaching hospitals reduced from 20% to 2%. In another study Berry 12 explored the relationship between volume and outcome for 4 common paediatric operations including repair of ventricular septal defect (VSD). For this subgroup no effect was detected between volume and mortality but VSD surgery was much more centralised to specialist children's hospitals than the other 3 operations wh ich the author considered may have provided a protective effect. A study by Morales 32 of patients receiving a VAD found an effect of volume on mortality where comparator was not just high volume but high volume teaching hospitals versus other centres. We included 2 studies of cardiac transplant and both identified lower mortality rates in high volume hospitals. However, one study included only adults 10 and the other 16 focused on children and both included a range of conditions other than CHD. These studies add to the already substantial evidence on centralisation of transplant services but are of limited relevance to the evidence base on specialist paediatric CHD service provision. Relationship between proximity and distance on mortality and volume on non-mortality outc omes The provision of good CHD surgical care requires not just surgical expertise but also provision of the associated services that provide pre-and postoperative care. It has been suggested that the proximity of these services, for example by having them all available on one site rather than having to transfer patients at critical times for specialist care, may also be a factor that contributes to outcome in CHD. In addition, although the emphasis of volume on outcome is dominated by mortality, it can be argued that there may also be an effect on non- mortali ty patient outcomes such as morbidity and quality of life and service consequences 221 \u00a9 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

We identified seven studies that explored relationships other than volume and mortality for CHD.

Patients cared for in lowest volume centres are more likely to develop this specific complication when compared to the highest volume centres. 224 40 We identified two studies that specifically looked at proximity of associated specialist servic es and both examined the effect of a specialist cardiac paediatric intensive care unit (cPICU). In a multicentre study Burstein 14 compared care in cPICU with other ICU and found no effect on mortality except for STS-EACTS 3 level cases and primarily in patients undergoing atrioventricular repair and arterial switch operations suggesting that potential benefits may only be applicable to specific patient groups. Eldadah 19 conducted a single centre before and after study evaluating the impact of introducing a cardiac cPICU and found a reduction in mortality and a bigger effect in reducing morbidity (wound infection and chest re-exploration). One study by Karamlou 25 explored the relationship between centre ECMO case volume and mortali ty in paediatric patients requiring ECMO and found a decreased mortality rate in the highest volume ECMO centres supporting the concept of regionalising highly specialist services. In a related study discussed earlier Hickey 22 examined not only the effect of volume on mortality but also ICU nursing staffing and skill mix. They found no relationship between nursing staffing and skill mix and mortality but did find high nursing workload was associated with volume. They concluded it is possible that nursing staffing levels may already be above the threshold needed to detect an effect on mortality. Two studies examined the relationship between distance from a specialist cardiac centres and mortality 20 37 and both found no relationship between distance and mortality although Fixler 20 found higher mortality in specific geographical areas where there was no identifiable cardiac centre. This effect may be as dependent on demographic factors as distance. Pinto 37 did find a higher rate of adverse events in one group although this was the mid distance (and not nearest or furthest) and the paper raised the possibility that the effect may be a consequence of follow up and monitoring policies related to proximity to a centre rather than distance itself. We found two studies where the primary outcomes in relation to volume were complication rates. The study by Benavidez 11 primarily looked at complication rates although mortality rates were also measured. The main findings were that higher volume centres had higher complication rates but that lowest volume centres had higher mortality rates. They 225 \u00a9 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

The study by Mery 31;49 looked at risk factors for one specific complication - chylothorax - and found a relationship with a reduced rate of chylothorax in the highest volume centres compared to other centres. Nevertheless the same study also observed that some small volume centres had comparable complication rates to high volume again highlighting variability between centres. A small number of the other studies we have included also examined non-mortality outcomes. In addition to the Eldadah 19and Pinto 37 studies mentioned above, Tabbutt 40 and Davies 16 both found lower complication rates in high volume centres following Norwood procedure. Burstein 14, Berry 12 and Pasquali 35 all found no association between volume and complication rates. Karamlou 26 and Davies 16 both found low volume centres were associated with longer length of stay. Two studies 32 26 also assessed costs and both found a relationship of higher costs associated with low volume centres. Mery31 found chylothorax complication increased both length of stay and costs. Although these variables were not ex plicitly tested in conjunction with volume in this study, this does provide some indication, given the relationship of lower complication rates in high volume units, that there is likely to be an association. There is a more substantial literature on costs and volume but this was outside the scope of our review. 226 42 Chapter 7. Discussion Summary of the evidence about the relationship between volume and outcomes The evidence reviewed did not include any UK studies and is predominantly based on outcomes in paediatric patients. Overall, we have found that although the evidence does demonstrate a relationship between volume and outcome in the majority of studies this relations hip is not consistent. Instead there is a mixed picture with both effect and no effect be ing reported. Studies on single conditions or procedures were more likely to identify an effect of volume on mortality but, given that the focus of these studies were for populations of patients with complex conditions and associated surgical procedures that require highly specialised care and expertise, this in itself is unsurprising. The findings from these studies we re not unequivocal as even within these highly selected groups there was considerable variation in effect depending on procedure type and individual centre performance. What these studies do indicate is the potential value of centralising or regionalising highly specialised services for very rare and complex cases. However, it cannot be assumed that comparable effects can be achieved for a much broader range of conditions and therefore used to define CHD centre volume. It is possible that surgeon volume may be as important as centre volume for these complex cases. The findings from studies that did consider broader CHD populations were more equivocal. In some studies where an effect was identified, the effect was weak or only demonstrable for specific subgroups of patients. There was no clear indication that the evidence for the volume and mortality relationship was substantially stronger than the evidence for a no effect relationship in these broader groups. The findings further highlight the complex relationship betwe en volume and outcome and the range of other factors which also have an effect. Some of these, such as condition severity, are well established but the effect of association of processes, systems and individual clinical effects on outcome remain unknown. W e also searched for evidence from studies on adult CHD but this only yielded 3 papers. One of these studies was concerned exclusively with cardiac transplantation for a range of 227 \u00a9 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

The main focus of the other two studies was the effect of surgeon type and both found that adult CHD patients had better outcomes when operated on by paediatric surgeons in specialist children's centres. Karamlou 26 found outcome was associated with surgeon volume and Kim 29 found a similar association with adult procedure volume indicating the influence of expertise on outcome. The previous systematic review conducted by Ewart 2 included studies published up until 2009. We have included studies considered by that review in this rapid review together with related studies published from 2009 to date. The review by Ewart included seven studies and concluded that whilst the evidence did suggest there is a relationship between volume and outcome it is likely that volume is a surrogate marker that encompasses other processes and system factors the effects of which are unknown. The additional evidence included in this review primarily adds further to our understanding of the complexity of the relationship between volume and outcome. Whilst there is now a larger number of studies reporting a relations hip between volume and outcome, these studies also increase the evidence that this is unlike ly to be a simple, independent and purely directly causal relationship. The effect of volume on outcome relative to the effect of other as yet undetermined health system factors remains a complex and unresolved research question. Summ ary of the evidence about the relationship between proximity and outcomes and volume and non-mortality outcomes We also attempted to identify studies that explored factors related to influencing outcomes in CHD other than the relationship between volume and mortality. This yielded only a small number of relevant papers. Two studies found sa benefit in terms of reducing mortality and morbidit y in patients cared for in specialist intensive care units.One study identified lower mortali ty for patients requiring ECMO who were cared for in high volume ECMO units. Two studi es on distance to specialist cardiac care found no relationship to mortality. Similarly we found only 2 studies where the primary objective considered the effect of volume on complications. However, a small number of the studies that examine the volume mortality relationship also measured morbidity as secondary outcomes. Such a small number of relevant studies do not provide a robust evidence base on related factors but collectively they do highlight that the overriding emphasis of research studies on CHD services has been 228 44 dominated by measurement of the relationship between volume and mortality and mainly short term, in hospital mortality. Care is the product of a complex set of processes of which volume of activity in any given centre or unit is only one contributor. There appears to be relatively little evidence from studies that attempt to measure the effect of related processes on outcome. The consequences of care, and hence outcomes, are also greater than may be captured by data on short term mortality. Long term mortality is also important, as are a range of other important short and long term outcomes for survivors including morbidity (for example complications) physical and neurological functioning and quality of life, and service consequences such as length of stay and costs, that seem to have received scant attention. As a consequence the available evidence base that can inform CHD service design is seriously limited and does not reflect the complex features and relationships that contribute to service provision. What are the issues that have emerged from the evidence? We have not conducted a systematic review but in assessing a broader topic range and more cur rent literature we have identified some key themes. 1. There are a range of factors which influence mortality in CHD and centre volume is only one of them. In our data extraction we recorded variables within studies that were also identified as associated with mortality. This process revealed a wide range of patient, demographic and service factors that also have an impact on outcome. The most influential risk factor for mortality by far is the severity of the condition and the associated surgical complexity needed to treat that condition. Where an effect of volume on mortality was measured, in general this tended to be greater in high risk patients as illustrated by the studies on complex single conditions. This is further supported by some of the studies that included broader CHD populations. It is reasonable to assume that complex high risk surgery requires high level surgical expertise. A small number of studies have attempted to try to disentangle the effects of individual surgeon performance on outcome but with mixed results. This requires further exploration as this complex relationship of what has an effect - a high volume of complex procedures in a centre or a high volume of complex procedures by an individual surgeon - is still unclear. Furthermore, there is some evidence (Karamlou 27) that it cannot be assumed that a high level of technical competence in one complex procedure translates across a range of conditions. 229 \u00a9 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Medicine moves forward and clinical advances, training, increasing expertise and changes in service provision mean outcomes for CHD have also changed over time. F ive studies that analysed data over long time periods (~10years) measured changes in mortality over time and found that, irrespective of other factors including volume, mortality decreased despite increasing complexity 18 44 41 30 8 illustrating ongoing clinical improvement. What this also means is that the relevance of findings from historical studies or more recent studies that have used historical data will not reflect current care and clinical improvements and so relevance to contemporary services needs to be considered. This observation also has impli cations for future research. The most recent study by Welke 42 attempted to establish the case volume thresholds needed to detect changes in mortality and concluded that some individual procedures occurred too infrequently or mortality rates were too low to reliably use mortality as a measure of between centre performance. If clinical advances continue to improve survival, this principle will need to be borne in mind. 3. Although aggregated data may show a difference in mortality rates between low and high volume centres, such aggregation may mask between-centre variation. The studies by Gray 21, Pasquali 34,Karamlou 27 and McHugh 30 all identified variation between centres with some low or medium volume centres performing equally as well as those with high volume. These studies acknowledged that there are likely to be other centre effects such as training, management protocols, expertise, teaching hospitals, availability of services composition of care teams and quality programmes that influence outcome. As a result it is unclea r whether it is volume or these other effects that are influencing outcome. 4. The evidence base available to guide UK decisions on service design and configuration for CHD is dominated by predominantly retrospective and uncontrolled studies conducted within the USA. A noteworthy absence is the lack of any relevant large, we ll designed UK multicentre studies. The extent to which the reported findings are generalisable and relevant to the UK setting is therefore limited. In the USA services are orga nised very differently to the UK. Key differences include geography and therefore distances to specialist care; multiple providers of health care which means variation in organisation of services, for example numbers of units within different counties and states, and complex health service financing models. many of the studies have analysed centres with very small volumes of cases - for very rare complex cases the volume of cases may be 230 46 less than 5 a year and for broader CHD services some studies have included centres treating less than 20 cases a year. Elsewhere and in line with other specialist services there has been a move to centralisation or regionalisation of CHD services, particularly in Europe (52 53). In the UK CHD services for children are already regionalised and so evidence on the relationship of very small volume centres on mortality has little relevance to decision making about services which are already highly centralised. However, CHD services for adults are less centralised, so decision making relating to service provision may be informed by evidence relating volume and outcomes. It is axiomatic that, with this centralisation there is also a corresponding increase in volume as more cases are concentrated in fewer centres but centres will also be characterised by the range of factors associated with service provision discussed previously. It remains unclear whether the impact of volume on outcome is largely a consequence of higher volume units organising and providing a complex service and high quality service with all the \"right\" components that would be expected to reduce risk, or an independent factor directly related to the advantages of dealing with a larger number of cases. For example staff may have more experience of specific procedures and potential complications. It is the individual and combined effects of these complex factors on clinical outcomes for patients that remain to be unpicked. Without this better understanding the appropriate interpretation of the observed volume - outcome relationship remains unclear. There is also a lack of evidence about the effects of service factors such as proximity to specialist services and the impact of care on outcomes ot her than mortality. 5. Despite the growing number of studies on the relationship between volume and outcome few studies have suggested what the optimum size of a CHD centre in terms of volume should be. Less than half of the included studies analysed volume as a continuous variable (14/35 relevant studies) which would provide the most robust evidence from which to consider volume thresholds. Analyses conducted with volume as a categorical variable carry several limitations in informing decisions about volume thresholds both in terms of dec isions about within study thresholds and the questionable robustness of the findings. This is particularly the case when comparisons have only been made between very high and very low volume centres only. Dinh 18 suggested the inverse relationship between volume and 231 \u00a9 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

However these authors did not go as far as identifying what this should be. Hirsch 23 suggested that a reasonable threshold for referral of children requiring Norwood procedure is centres doing at least 20 procedures a year and 10 procedures a year for arterial switch operation. Bazzani and Marcin 8 constructed scatter plots of volume against mortality and found no obvious threshold for centre volume. The review by Ewart 2 considered the data presented by Welke 15 and suggested a possible threshold of 200-250 cases per year. Welke6 clearly expressed the view that volume is likely to be a surrogate for the processes and characteristics of care systems that produce outcomes and that centre specific quality measures would be more informative than volume thresholds . Pasquali 34 and Vinocur 41;50 concurred with this view and suggested that service design decisions should be guided by a range of individual centre performance measures and not volume. There are consistent and clear messages within the literature we have reviewed about the danger of viewing volume in isolation. Furthermore, included studies also caution concerning the likely but as yet poorly understood interaction of volume with the numerous other clinical and structural dimensions that contribute to delivering high quality services and hence good outcomes. Finally, questions still remain concerning what volume should be the item of consideration - is it whole service volume, complex procedure volume or individual surgeon volume that should direct decisions? Methodological Limitations of the Included Studies Quality assessment and methodological limitations As this is a rapid review we have not conducted a quality appraisal of individual included studies. However, we have considered the collective methodological limitations of these studies in order to provide an overview of study quality and have assessed the usefulness of these studi es in answering the research questions. Appendix Four provides a simple summary of key items for each paper that relate to the usefulness of studies on CHD services. Items relate to whether studies have conducted analyses that have adjusted for the two key risk factors for mortality, severity/complexity and age, whether they are single or multicentre studies and whether they included at least two CHD conditions or procedures. In summary, 37/39 studi es adjusted for severity, 28/39 adjusted for age although some studies on specific 232 48 groups of patients were confined to specific age groups e.g. neonates, 35/39 were multicentre studies with just three single centre studies and 25/39 studies included a population with more than one condition or procedure. Author assessments of study limitations Many authors of included studies take great care to point out the methodological limitations of their studies and caution against over-interpretation of their findings. Included studies are predominantly retrospective and observational in nature. There were no prospective studies. Such design features make it very problematic when trying to establish a direct inverse relationship of cause (volume) to effect (mortality). Many of the source databases are limited in being prima rily created for administrative purposes, for example claims data collection and billing 23 26 6 42 29 17;51. As a consequence we can have little confidence in the clinical coding 42, although several studies seek to ascertain accuracy by comparing the coding for diagnosis with coding for the surgical procedure 42 in order to establish internal coherence and consistency. Information bias might be introduced through \"miscoding of information provided, missing data, or misinterpretation of data\" 23. Incompleteness of data is considered problematic - for example, even where records are available large numbers of surgeon identifiers may be missing 12. Other data sources were voluntary which introduces problems of selection bias as they may be selective in their coverage 43 27 36 41) or a ccording to predefined membership or explicit criteria 40. Changes or indeed inconsistency in institutional characteristics, such as coding for teaching status, may result in one hospital being coded differently across different points of an interrupted time-series 13. Welke 6 considered that in large datasets errors in quality are likely to be random rather than systematic although it could also be argued that for data on r are conditions errors may then be systematic. A key concern of this report relates not simply to the surgical performance of different size units but also to the personnel and structural characteristics of the observed surgical units. On these latter matters administrative source databases have little contextual data to offer 14. Import ant contextual details are thought to include institutional factors such as team composition, individual surgeon training and experience, type of facility (e.g., freestanding children's hospital, general hospital), trans fusion practices, infection control, and care 233 \u00a9 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Indeed several commentators also bemoan the lack of even basic clinical contextual details such as certain anatomic features 13 or accompanying non-surgical procedures. Critical details such as non-intervention, transfer to another institution, and preoperative mortality are frequently unavailable 15. Furthermore some clinical data features rely on subjective judgement while perioperative details are frequently missing 36. I t is essential to recognise that not all in-hospital mortality will have an underlying surgical cause 39. A f urther consideration occurs where the research question is deliberately prescribed i.e. where data relate to a single institution, a single year or, as with a substantial proportion of studie s, to a single procedure. Data relating to a single institution is unlikely to be generalizable, particularly in the absence of details of the pattern of referrals to that location 37. While analysing data from a single year circumvents concerns relating to structural changes or improvements in procedures over time 39 it carries the attendant danger of placing inordinate and inappropriate emphasis on an isolated timepoint. Finally, in the case of study reports of a single surgical procedure, the insights to be gained by a more extended examination of a discrete area of surgical practice involving typically more rare and complex conditions are outweighed, at least for the question that is the focus of this report, by neglecting overall surgical volume. Such studies thus provide a negligible contribution to the \"evidence\" that relates to optimal volumes for entire CHD services. The well-reported characteristic of paediatric cardiac surgery as covering a wide range of conditions and associated procedures poses a further threat to accurate interpretation. While it is helpful to consider an overall portfolio of procedures the data for rare conditions necessarily involves small numbers of procedures 14. Combining this statistical characteristic with the decreasing numbers of events of interest (i.e. mortality), particularly as cardiac surgical procedures improve, further limits the value of the reported results 33 42. Numbers of procedures and numbers of deaths are particularly limited in low volume units meaning that low units are particularly vulnerable to even very small errors in the data. With the ongoing development of methods for analysing the volume-outcome conundrum comes increasing recognition of the unsuitability of certain methods of investigation and analysis. For example recent papers carry almost universal acknowledgement of the inappropriateness of any analysis that does not take into account any adjustments for risk 38 234 50 and complexity. Handling data on number of procedures as a continuous, rather than a categorical, variable is now considered essential while approaches that seek to establish a threshold that represents a step-wise change in outcome are frequently criticised for being unsophisticated and misleading 26. It would be negligent to overlook the considerable advances in methodology that have occurred during the time period charted by these included studies. The increasing sophistication of the tools that seek to score for complexity are just one such example, as documented in Appendix Four. However while evolution and improvement of such tools and scores is to be welcomed such ongoing modification adds further to the complexity of a research area already characterised by considerable clinical heterogeneity. It is arguable whether the ongoing debates regarding the optimal configuration for volume/outcome are likely to be resolved in the absence of a comprehensive and accurate national database that provides sufficient information for risk stratification, complexity scoring and adequate contextual detail on clinical context as well as on structural and personnel related factors. 235 \u00a9 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Conclusions We have conducted a rapid review of the evidence on the relationship between volume and outcome, and other service factors and outcome, for CHD. We found a large proportion of pape rs which analysed the relationship between volume and mortality for paediatric CHD surgery, but very limited evidence in relation to the other factors of interest, or for adult populations. It is noteworthy that so much evidence is available in what is a relatively sma ll clinical specialty. No UK based studies or cross country comparions were identified. Th is review identified a substantial number of studies reporting a positive relationship be tween volume and outcome, but the complexity of the relationship and of the evidence un derpinning it requires careful interpretation . The mixed picture emerging from the 39 included studies increases our understanding of the complexity of this relationship and hig hlights variation in both methods and findings across individual studies, the potential effects of a range of other factors that may interact with volume and influence outcome, and the methodol ogical limitations imposed by the research approaches taken. Even though our systematic, yet time-limited, searches have revealed a substantial volume of data on CHD outcomes, the existing data sources carry major limitations, particularly given the absence of information on clinical and service-related processes and outcomes, which are consistently recognised as important to patient care and patient safety. As a consequence, it is pr oblematic to interpret the current evidence for the relationship between volume and outcome as the impact ofthis relationship may be having cannot be disentangled from the eff ects of other factors. The limitations of the rapid review approach means we could not consider conducting a meta-analysis of the evidence on volume and outcome but this is an option that could be considered and which may further enhance the evidence available. Further evidence review of the broader fields of cardiac surgery (rather than just CHD) may also contribute to identifying some of the clinical and service related processes and outcomes that may be relevant to CHD and provide a framework for future data collection and new studie s. The design, development and delivery of consistently good quality and safe services require an understanding of the complex components and interactions that constitute a service and how these influence patient outcome. There is a clear evidence gap that needs to be addressed 236 52 with regard to: better understanding of the relationships between the wide range of organisational factors in CHD services; how these relationships can potentially predict a number of ou tcomes of relevance to patients and families; and the causal pathways between orga nisational factors and outcomes. The development and validation of clinical and administrative databases which can be used for observational studies of the relationship between organisational factors and outcomes would clearly be a valuable resource. There is scope to expand the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research (NICOR) databa se to consistently collect et information on a wider range of processes, organisational factors and outcomes related to quality of care that are not captured at present. It is our consi dered opinion that this should be the target at which future research efforts should be directed. This would support the design and conduct of UK studies and help address the clear lack ofevidence relevant to service provision in the NHS. 237 \u00a9 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Appendices Appendix One - Final Protocol Rapid Evidence Synthesis Proposal - What evidence is there on how organisational features affect patient outcomes in congenital heart disease services? Background : This proposal has been written in response to a request by NHS England to further examine the evidence around the delivery of congenital heart disease (CHD) services. The purpose of the evidence synthesis is to support the ongoing review about how these services should be best organised. Services for children with CHD have been the subject of scrutiny for a number of years. In 2012, following an extensive review as part of the \"Safe and Sustainable\" work programme, a series of recommendations were made for the re-configuration of cardiac services for this patient group (NHS Specialised services, 2012). The recommendations of \"Safe and Sustaina ble\" were challenged and were subsequently the subject of a Judicial Review (JR) and an Independent Reconfiguration Panel (IRP) who concluded that the processes of the review were flawed. Consequently service reconfiguration was not implemented. These services are subject to a new review which will consider the whole lifetime pathway for CHD. The JR and IRP (IRP 2013) identified a number of issues of concern with the \"Safe and Sustainable\" process including the use and interpretation of the existing evidence base on delivery of surgical services for CHD and patient outcome. In particular they questioned the reliance on evidence around the relationship between volume of cases and outcomes. A 2009 literature review (Ewart, 2009) had examined this evidence in detail and, although confirming the existence of a relationship between volume and outcome, also cautioned that this relationship alone was not sufficient to make recommendations on the size of units needed as the effects of other contributory system and process factors to this relationship were unclear in the published literature. Rapid review process: This is a rapid evidence synthesis which needs to be completed within a very short timeframe to produce a review which is relevant and timely. Therefore 249 \u00a9 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014. This work was produced by Goyder et al. under the terms of a commissioning contract issued by the Secretary of State for Health. This document may be freely reproduced for the purposes of private research and study and extracts may be included in professional journals provided that suitable acknowledgement is made and the reproduction is not associated with any form of advertising.

The review will not attempt to identify all relevant evidence or to search exhaustively for all evidence that meets the inclusion criteria, although the proposed searching approach aims to identify the key evidence. Similarly the data extraction and quality assessment will focus on the most critical information for evidence synthesis rather than aiming to exhaustively extract and critique all the available information in individual papers. Given time and resource constraints, and the need to work in a transparent and reproducible manner, our review will focus on identifying and synthesising the key evidence as described below. Purpose of review : The purpose of this literature review is to examine what evidence there is on how organisational features affect patient outcomes in congenital heart disease services . Review questions: The literature review can be more specifically framed to focus on two key orga nisational features. The rationale for this is based on the existing, evidence-based, consensus that there may be a relationship between the volume of CHD procedures and patient outcomes and the clinical consensus that reconfiguration which includes the co- location (or increased proximity) of specialist services may be related to better patient outcomes. The questions are as follows: 1a. What is the current evidence for the relationship between institutional and surgeon volume and patient outcomes and how is that relationship influenced by complexity of pr ocedure and by patient case mix? 1b. How are patient outcomes influenced by proximity to/colocation with other specialist clinical services (e.g. co-location of services such as specialist cardiac paediatric intensive care)? Scope: Clearly there is enormous scope to both search for and review related evidence as the subje ct area incorporates several different dimensions. The literature review will focus on evidence from CHD services for children and adults as this will be the most relevant. Evidence from other paediatric surgical services and evidence from general adult cardiac services may also be relevant to CHD services. Where there is limited evidence from the 250 66 CHD literature, the review will potentially consider the wider literature on these other clinically similar services as feasible and where relevant. Appendix 1 sets out our proposed conceptual framework to guide the review process. This framework will allow us to: Define the scope of the search strategy Define inclusion and exclusion criteria to specify what types of studies will be included in the final report Construct summary tables of all included studies to present key information and findings Synthesise the evidence from the included studies The report will not appraise the evidence in terms of how future services should be provided or make recommendations about service configuration. Methods: Search - Our initial approach will be to develop a search strategy based on the search strategy of Ewart et al (2009) with some modifications in order to capture a wider evidence base around the other explanatory factors (see conceptual framework) and a wider range of interventions (both adult and paediatric surgical and interventional cardiology services), within the time constraints of a rapid review. The search strategy is structured relevant terms as follows: Population = adults and children receiving treatment for congenital heart disease Intervention = organisational factors (based on volume and proximity) Outcomes = mortality, complications and related outcomes The databases that will be searched are: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science (Science Citation Index and Social Science Citation Index) and CINAHL. In addition to the database search as outlined above, we will also undertake the following to identify key evidence for the review: 251 \u00a9 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Citation searching on papers included in Ewart (2009) and other key papers identified by topic experts. Scrutiny of reference lists of included primary studies and relevant systematic reviews. Scrutiny of recent reviews of services and guideline documents for relevant peer reviewed evidence. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria - the evidence included in the review will be restricted to quantitative studies to ensure it addresses the key review questions and outcomes of interest. This is likely to be observational evidence; however there may be evidence from trials. The included evidence will be restricted to OECD countries only to ensure relative health system comparability. We will only include peer reviewed evidence published in order to ensure we are synthesising evidence which has already undergone methodological and expert scrutiny. We will limit the included evidence on the relationship between volume and outcome in paediatric cardiac surgery to 2009-2014 as evidence prior to 2009 is available in the Ewart review (Ewart 2009), which has undergone scrutiny through its inclusion in the \"Safe and Sustainable\" work programme. Other evidence will be i ncluded if published 2003-2014 in English to ensure the most recent relevant evidence is prioritised within the constraints of the rapid review process. The inclusion criteria can be summarised as follows: Population = adults and children undergoing treatment for congenital heart disease. Intervention = the organisation of treatment based on at least one of the following: volume of activity and/or proximity to/co-location with other related services. Only studies including either volume or proximity factors will meet the inclusion criteria of the review. Comparator = other methods of organisation of treatment (only studies with a comparator group will be included) Outcome = patient outcomes. Studies reporting process outcomes will only be included if they report at least one patient outcome. 252 68 Data Extraction - Formal data extraction of included papers will be undertaken and will include both the explanatory factors outlined in the conceptual framework and any other fac tors identified by included studies, as well as patient outcomes. This may include data on: Patient factors: Age of the patient casemix, range of the patient casemix. Organisation: volume of activity (institutional volume and staff volume), specialisation (adult/children/both), sub spec ialisation (nature and complexity of procedures), size of specialist unit (number of staff, number of beds etc.) , proximity to/co -location with other specialist clinical services, hospital/surgeon/nursing workloads, the health system that organisations ope rate in, timing of procedures and hospital/surgeon/nursing training/experience. Outcomes: mortality, life expectancy, morbidity, quality of life, complications of treatment; and possibly processes such as length of stay and unplanned readmission rates. Data on process outcomes will only be extracted from studies which report at least one patient outcome. We anticipate that outcomes will be reported using measures such as relative risks, odds ratios and mean differences. Where possible, given the time and resource limitations, these will be reported, alongside confidence intervals. We will also check which way around the data is reported in terms of a)the intervention and comparator (for example high versus low volume and vice versa) and b) the outcome (for example mortality or survival). Where possible, outc omes will be converted so that they are all in the same direction for both of the above factors. Quality Assessment - Rather than using a standard checklist approach, instead, the focus will be on an assessment of the overall quality and relevance of the evidence included in the review. The assessment of relevance will be made based on a number of factors which may include the study type, the country in which the research was undertaken, whether the research is single centre or multi centre, whether it included more than one procedure/intervention. The assessment of quality will be based on study type and other key factors. This process of quality and relevance assessment will allow readers of the rapid evidence synthesis to make an assessment of the hierarchy of relevance and quality of evidence included in the review. 253 \u00a9 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Through these multiple sources of information, the Registry monitors all births in Texas (approximately 400,000 each year) and identifies cases of birth defects. Once identified, detailed demographic and diagnostic data are abstracted and ent ered into the electronic registry. 364 180 Appendix 4b Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery (based on Jacobs 2012 112) Complexity stratification tools have seen increasing popularity in the analysis of outcomes associated with congenital and paediatric cardiac surgery, reflecting the fact that so many different distinct types of operations are performed. Since 2002, complexity stratification has been used extensively by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Congenital Heart Surgery Database and the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) Congenital Heart Surgery Database. Aristotle Complexity score The Aristotle Basic Complexity Score defines the complexity of an operation through three factors: potential for mortality, potential for morbidity, and technical difficulty of the opera tion. When designed in 2000, the Aristotle Complexity Score was entirely based on subjective probability. This approach, based on the opinion of experts, was considered a good solution due to the limited amount of data available at that time. The Aristotle score evaluates basic surgical performance and more complex surgical performance through two complexity scores: 1) the basic complexity score (1.5\u201415 points), which is a procedure adjusted c omplexity comprising four levels of complexity, and 2) the comprehensive complexity score (1.5\u201425 points), which adds patient-adjusted complexity (0 \u201410 points) to the procedure- adjusted complexity and comprises six categories. Risk Adju stment for Congenital Heart Surgery (RACHS-1) The Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery (RACHS-1) is a mortality risk-adjustment methodology based on paediatric cardiac procedures for congenital heart disease. The method was created to adjust for differences in case mix when examining in-hospital death rates after congenital heart surgery. RACHS-1 was developed using a consensus approach involving a nationally representative panel of paediatric cardiologists and surgeons in the United States. The focus of RACHS-1 is on short term mortality after surgery with inpatient mortality as the indicator for this outcome, as it is easily available in administrative data and other data sets. 365 \u00a9 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Applications for commercial reproduction should be addressed to: NIHR Journals Library, National Institute for Health Research, Evaluation, Trials and Studies Coordinating Centre, Alpha House, University of Southampton Science Park, Southampton SO16 7NS, UK. 181 The RACHS-1 method involves the grouping of different cardiac procedures with similar risks for in-hospital mortality into six risk categories, several of which are stratified by age or diagnosis. The procedures are organised into the six categories to form an ordinal scale of increasing risk for inpatient mortality, where category 1 has the lowest risk of death and category 6 the highest. In instances where a patient is undergoing multiple cardiac surgical procedures, the procedures are placed in the category corresponding to the single highest risk procedure. The risk categories were created by consensus judgement of the panel primarily using common coding systems such as International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). The allocation of procedures was subsequently refine d by using mortality data from two large multi-centre datasets. In order to measure case-mix as accurately as possible, the risk categories are usually included in multivariable models with other key variables such as age, prematurity, and the presence of a major non- cardiac structural such as cleft lip/palate or STS-EACTS (STS -EACTS categories) The STS-EACTS Congenital Heart Surgery Mortality Score, an objective, empirically based index used to identify the statistically estimated risk of in-hospital mortality by procedure and to group procedures into risk categories. When modelled with three patient-level factors (age, weight, and preoperative length of stay) STS EACTS has a C-statistic of 0.816. The tool was developed using primarily objective data with minimal use of subjective probability. The risk of mortality prior to discharge from the hospital after cardiac surgery was estimated for 148 types of operative procedures by using actual data from 77,294 patients entered into the Congenital Heart Surgery Databases of the EACTS (33,360 patients) and the STS (43, 934 patients) between 2002 and 2007. Procedure-specific mortality rate estimates were calculated using a Bayesian model that adjusted for small denominators. Each procedure was assigned a numeric score (the STS-EACTS Congenital Heart Surgery Mortality Score). Claimed advantages of the STS/EACTS Mortality Score and Categories include that it is based on objective evidence, rather than expert opinion, that it is able to classify more procedures than RACHS-1 or Aristotle and that it demonstrates a higher correlation with outcome (observed mortality) by c-statistic. 366 182 Appendix 4c Table of covariates of included studies Ta ble 27 Covariates of included studies - patient factors Patient Family income 7; 39 Gestational Age 40; 10 Table 28 Covariates of included studies - condition related Condition related Cardiac Diagnosis Congenital and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Following discussion, and with a number of suggested amendments, CAP approved the standards for discussion with stakeholders prior to formal consultation. This paper summarises views expressed during this pre-consultation period. In particular it reflects views from the review's Children and Young People Events, visits to CHD services across England and Wales, discussions with the review's three engagement and advisory groups and discussions at the CHD Clinical Reference Group. Some comments were also received via the NHS England website. In each case the paper seeks to accurately reflect what was said . The views expressed are those of the individuals and groups concerned and not the official views of NHS England. Rather they are reported to aid the development of the proposed standards. ScHARR was commissioned to undertake an independent review of the literature and its findings have been summarised at relevant points of this paper. Their work focused on two questions: What is the current evidence for the relationship between institutional and surgeon volume and patient outcomes and how is that relationship influenced by complexity of procedure and by patient case mix? How are patient outcomes influenced by proximity to/co-location with other specialist clinical services (e.g. co-location of services such as specialist cardiac paediatric intensive care)? The National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research was asked to examine its data and to advise on what this showed about service factors that could influence outcomes. Although the final write up of this work is not yet available, NICOR has kindly supplied a summary of the main findings and these have been incorporated in this paper. Recommendation CAP is asked to consider the standards in light of all these contributions and advise whether any amendments need to be made prior to full public consultation. 3742 Section A: The network approach Children and Young People Events No specific comments Visits to CHD services across England and Wales On our visits to CHD services across England and Wales many centres told us that network working is what makes a difference What makes networks work? Networks only succeed when given a lot of time, energy and commitment. All parties have to want them to succeed. Networks need to be managed and properly resourced - there are leadership, managerial and administrative costs. Networks are about relationships built over the long term. Having named link consultants with good relationships with local PECs/CWSIs is crucial. Effective network working is very dependent on individual relationships. Supporting PECs/CWSIs through outreach clinics, working alongside allows them to de velop their skills. Protocols, guidance and shared governance help reduce variation. Telemedicine and information systems Effective networks need shared information - clinical IT systems; videoconferencing; telemedicine. There were different views about the importance of being able to share scans. Regional or national networking Some centres consider that there is a role for network arrangements at a level above the hub and spoke model described in the standards. Regional networks would allow surgical centres to work more closely together and provide important quality assurance and mutual challenge, enhanced training and research opportunities. There was also support for a national network of surgical centres, and it was considered that developing this might be an NHS England / professional society joint venture. We heard that some units are not speaking to each other - relationships had been OK but were damaged by the Safe and Sustainable process. Networking between distant centres is a bit better than it was, but with near neighbours it is still strained. This reduces opportunities to learn from each other. Network boundaries, catchments, competition and choice We heard concern in some places about boundary issues and how to ensure that each unit gets the 'right number' of patients to meet the minimum requirements of activity for its number of surgeons. Transplant A small percentage of CHD will require transplant and access to transplant is limited not just by the number of donors but also by professional views of the potential success. 3753 Donation is the limiting factor with few donors from children. Most children who are transplanted receive adult hearts. We were told that patients who get to adulthood with CHD will rarely get a transplant because whenever a heart becomes available there will always be other potential recipients in whom the operation would be simpler and in whom better long term outcomes are more likely. Patient and Public Engagement and Advisory Group The group emphasised the importance of effective communications between clinicians across networks and nationally. The group considered that more attention needed to be given to transport and retrieval services (Embrace was raised as an example of best practice). Provider Engagement and Advisory Group The group asked for clarity about the proposed model for CHD networks. Were they operational delivery networks? There was a view that while ODN functions of shared pathways and joint working were being described other roles with a greater emphasis on sharing and learning to drive quality were also being described and this might be a different sort of network. The group considered that it would be possible to describe quality driven relationships Clinician Engagement and Advisory Group Network boundaries, catchments, competition and choice A subgroup considered the question of whether network boundaries should be managed or should emerge as a result of competition and choice. The group considered that unless boundaries were managed it would continue to damage relationships. They considered that managed boundary networks would be more efficient and would drive costs down. The group therefore advised a more formal statement about this issue. The group considered how boundaries could be set in a managed scenario (closest, shortest journey time) and how commissioners could enforce these arrangements, for example by not paying for activity where the boundaries were not respected. Other members of the clinician group considered that patient choice must be allowed which implied competition. The managed boundary model proposed led to units that would be similarly sized. Some considered that there was a case for at least some units to be larger. Others argued that if units all had to undertake at least 500 cases this meant that the decision not to have bigger units had in effect been taken. Experience from trauma networks was that managed network boundaries had been effective and well accepted. 3764 Transplant A sub-group considered the approach to transplant taken in the standards. They advised that the paediatric standards were fine. Adults requiring transplant range from simple procedures that can be done in any of the transplant centres to complex patients who can only be done where there is special expertise that are almost all done in Newcastle. In the future we can expect more complex adult demand - a second centre may be required to do this work. There will also be a continued rise in the use of mechanical assist devices both as bridge to transplant and, in time, as destination therapy. Arrangements would also need to cover heart and lung transplant and not just heart transplant as demand for these procedures could be expected to rise. The group identified a problem in applying the standards - the Newcastle centre is in a sparsely populated region where there won't be enough patients to meet the CHD activity requirements. The group advised that some sort of super network and intelligent commissioning will be needed if the CHD work is not to close the transplant service. It was proposed that there should be a minor change in wording to differentiate between referral of simple rather than Complex patients: The proposed adult standard (A2) which stated that \"each specialist ACHD centre must demonstrate formal working relationships with a cardiothoracic transplant centre staffed by transplant surgeons with a congenital practice\" has been modified to read \"each specialist ACHD centre must demonstrate formal working relationships with cardiothoracic transplant centres, including one staffed by transplant surgeons with a congenital practice\" Clinical Reference Group Network boundaries, catchments, competition and choice There was discussion about network boundaries and pathways of care. The discussion noted that there would be a difficulty guaranteeing enough activity at some centres if network boundaries were not defined by commissioners but that the approach had also to recognise that competition/choice is allowed in the NHS and fixed boundaries would be anti-competitive. There was a view that network boundaries should take account of \"normal expected\" pathway flows. There was not general agreement that boundaries should be fixed. Congenital networks The CRG agreed that there should be combined CHD networks covering both children and adults. A clear definition of a \"Network\" is needed including descriptions of network leadership roles and responsibilities. There should be a single lead clinician across both aspects of the network. Network development There would be a need to define pathways of care from the outset recognising that the Network Functions will take time to establish. 3775 Multidisciplinary Team The MDT membership is not sufficiently defined. Need to define core members. The group proposed a minimum of three members - congenital cardiologist, congenital surgeon, specialist anaesthetist. NHS England website - comments Network boundaries, catchments, competition and choice One comment stated that in order to attract and retain patients NHS specialised service providers have to listen and adapt to the changing needs of their patients. Those service providers which have implemented continuous improvements and change are those which naturally attract more patients and referring clinicians. This is not something that can be done nationally as the changes necessary often require local support and long term commitment. Any centre which is failing to attract enough patients to successfully employ enough staff to safely run its service and have successful succession planning has to look to itself and ask why. That centre needs to ask what is happening in those centres which are increasing their services naturally and ask what is it that they are doing that we are not.

Clinician Engagement and Advisory Group The role of tier 2 specialist cardiology centres A subgroup considered that the limitations on interventional cardiology in tier 2 ACHD centres were too inflexible and that there was the potential for these units to do more. This should be different for ACHD than paediatric CHD because adult cardiologists exist outside SSCs but do not for paediatrics. It was noted that the majority of adult ASD closure is currently undertaken outside specialist surgical centres and that the results are good. They considered that the flexibility offered by the standard on electrophysiology was more appropriate - this requires that patients are discussed at the MDT. The group considered that this flexibility should be replicated for other forms of intervention / diagnostic catheters and that more should be allowed outside the surgical centre with network agreement. This might include ASD and PFO closure. They also recommended that arrangements for ASDs and PFOs should be consistent to reduce the risk of gaming. It was agreed that as a minimum BCS standards must be met including numbers of interventionists and numbers of procedures undertaken by each. The proposed tier 2 ACHD standards would also need to be met. Clinical Reference Group Interventional cardiology in tier 2 specialist ACHD centres* There was a discussion about the potential for interventional cardiology to be undertaken at tier 2 specialist ACHD centres, for example for the repair of ASDs. Currently the standards require that these are only undertaken at a specialist surgical centre, but interventionists from tier 2 centres (who have been appropriately trained and who meet the minimum volume thresholds) may undertake these procedures at the specialist surgical centre. The group considered that for this to be possible the level 2 unit would need to meet both the level 2 standards and the appropriate requirements for interventional cardiology services described in the tier 1 standards. The requirement for specialist congenital surgical back-up in particular was considered essential and surgical members of the group were of the view that congenital surgeons based at specialist surgical centres would not and could not provide this. [nb. this record of CRG discussions is subject to ratification by the group] 3797 Long term viability The CRG expressed concerns about the viability of the Tier 2 Centres - both in achieving the standards on a sustainable basis and a concern that recruitment of high quality staff to these centres may present a problem. Other issues Standards should affirm need for beds based on population/patient activity and provision should be aligned accordingly Standards should specify need for dedicated sonographer The standard on research needs to be stronger and include requirement for \"national research\" Where fetal diagnostics are provided in tier 2 centres, all staff must have the appropriate specialist expertise in fetal cardiology or refer onto the tier 1 service/specialist fetal centre NHS England website - comments No specific comments ScHARR review No specific comments National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research review No specific comments 3808 Tier 3 Local Cardiology Centres / Local Hospitals Children and Young People Events Local A&E and paediatric services Local units find complex cases very difficult to manage and the parent needs to be the advocate which worries them - particularly if they can't be there all the time We heard about a situation when a local unit said her son 'was good for a child with CHD' but the parent knew that he 'wasn't right' - insistence on calling main centre who asked for a lung xray and both lungs had collapsed. Patient and the parents in particular have a big advocacy role but too often are not listened t o - they are the experts and are seen as overly cautious by the doctors. Would be helpful if there was a way to flag these children on the system particularly for the local hospitals - a national database feels rather obvious - so that parents wouldn't be relied on - particularly in stressful situations. Visits to CHD services across England and Wales Local CHD Services We heard about good work in many places to develop role of PECs/CWSIs. Local tier 3 services are really important both to allow patients to receive more care locally and to ensure that specialist centres can focus on the most complex patients. The growth in the number of adult CHD patients makes the role of local centres even more important - specialists centres would be overwhelmed without the support of good local services. We heard concerns in a number of places about whether CCGs would see local CHD services as a priority, and therefore a risk that they might not want to fund them. Local A&E and paediatric services We were told that local hospitals do not consistently deliver a good service to these patients / families Emergency admissions via A&E were cited as difficult Do not consistently contact specialist centres for advice Appear to not know what they are doing Act against the advice of the parents who are expert in their child's condition Non specialist staff locally makes parents feel isolated and rely on the specialist centre Community and local hospital staff forget that the parents do become experts in their children's health and must be included in care decisions locally - they will know a lot more about the specific aspects of the child's care and 'what's right for their child' Many parents say they have to get aggressive to get care for their children locally, for concerns to be taken seriously, phoning surgeons and cardiac consultants desperately looking for them to influence the local care being given. Poor consistency in delivery of services close to home: community nurses, health visitors, GPs, prescribing specialist medication, blood tests Local hospitals are by passed in favour of specialist centres because of lack of faith in local hospitals to listen to them and call the specialist centre for advice 3819 Inconsistent GP involvement Because baby/child in the congenital heart system, children and babies (and post natal mothers) fall out of the normal health care/social system and struggle to get back in - health visitors, community nurses, midwives, GP's either aren't involved, aren't aware of the child, or are scared of the child and being involved in their health Once trust is lost in local DGHs very hard to get back, means parents are dependen t on one hospital and surgeon/ specialist nurse and will travel great distances to get to the care they trust Unaware of what is available locally to support other family members - particularly siblings We heard about a number of things that work well Open access to their local centres and therefore bypass A&E which has a positive impact Some hospitals have good links with the specialist centres and work with the parents as a partner in their child's care Handheld notes with patients history and medication that can be shared with other medics Experiences where the GP worked in partnership with the specialist centre to deliver local care Good IT across the network to support clinicians would be helpful to make these links work even better Engagement and advisory groups No specific comments Clinical Reference Group Commissioning The CRG affirmed the importance of tier 3 services which offer the opportunity for many patients to avoid long journeys to specialist centres. However the CRG feels strongly that the activity which takes place in a tier 3 centre should be classified as \"specialised\" (outreach and PEC/CWSI). A PSAG submission would be required for this with a clear case for change with numbers and potential cost implications. The CRG does not feel that the tariff in tier 3 centres is sufficient to meet the standards. Specific Standards Concern was expressed that the standards may be pitched too high, in a way that could deter some local hospitals from trying to deliver this type of service Is exercise testing a requirement in a tier 3 service? Archiving of documents needs to be the same across all 3 tiers. The group recommended that fetal diagnosis should only be undertaken in tier 3 units as part of an out-reach service. NHS England website - comments No specific comments 38210 ScHARR review No specific comments National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research review No specific comments 38311 Section B: Staffing and skills Children and Young People Events Psychology and counselling There should be a psychologist available for patients - someone to talk to (especially for older children) . Genetics often have a coun sellor - this should be available to all It would be good to have someone non-medical in the hospital to talk to - counsellor or youth worker Specialist Nurses There should be more Liaison nurses on each ward - they are stretched too thin but a wonderful resource. Cardiac liaison nurses play an essential role and are seemingly overworked Play and clowns Every hospital should have Clown Doctors - children love it - great form of entertainment Could there be a play therapist on site that could be commissioned? Practicalities Where possible there should be a male nurse on each ward Staff need to be easily identifiable so you know who to talk to - on the uniform, or by colour coding, or a sign in the ward Patients should be told when there is a shift change so they know there will be a new nurse to look for Competence Staff should not be doing procedures they are not trained to do Clinician mobility Mobility of staff/doctors/surgeons needs to be encouraged - the current system seems to work in the opposite way Private practice Parents wanted to know how we work out whether time that is being spent in private practice is calculated when looking at work ratios. Also need to look at the ratio of people to patients. Visits to CHD services across England and Wales Specialist nurses The role of the specialist nurse is absolutely pivotal for patients. Their role encompasses system navigation, counselling and support, problem resolution, educator. In some places it was noted that because numbers were limited the service that nurse specialists could offer was limited. Should have liaison nurse in outpatients. 38412 Surgeon numbers and minimum activity levels Surgeons have mixed views about whether the minimum number of surgeons in a team should be three or four. This was not simply conditioned by the scale of their own unit. Surgeons who advocate for larger surgical teams are not usually motivated by concerns for out of hours arrangements or work life balance considerations. Rather the number of surgeons is used as a proxy for the scale of the unit - perceived advantages being greater subspecialisation within surgical teams, better supporting facilities and staffing, more attractive units for recruitment, greater opportunities for training and research. These are not seen as ends in themselves but as important contributors to higher quality services that will improve outcomes. Surgeons recognised the importance of being able to access specialist advice and support from other centres. Strained relationships mean that some centres will not contact some other centres. Where surgeons had experience of being asked to assist a colleague at another hospital it had often proved to be frustratingly difficult to sort out the HR clearances needed to do so. Surgeons all supported a minimum of 125 operations. They told us that this must be seen as a minimum. They are clear that this is a more important determinant of surgical quality than the number of surgeons in a team and that increasing the number of surgeons in a team must never be at the expense of minimum levels of activity. Some surgeons consider that maintaining skills is not just about numbers but also about case mix so some considered that in counting a distinction should be made between short and long procedures. Some were sceptical that more than a minority of operations are dual surgeon operating so this counting issue could be unimportant. Some thought that senior surgeons don't need to do so much surgery to maintain skills and that they could do more adult work but would still be competent to tackle paediatric work because of their accumulated experience. Out of hours The need for out of hours emergency surgery in this specialty is low (except for transplant centres) so is not considered especially onerous. However it is important that on call arrangements ensure the prompt availability of a surgeon with the skills to deal with whatever problem presents. This is not just a matter of the number of surgeons in a team - the degree of subspecialisation in their surgical practice matters as does the availability of other surgeons when needed. Out of hours these arrangements seem usually to be informal. An alternative approach is to ensure that all surgeons practice across the whole age range. We heard that most emergencies are arrhythmias. Some difficult arrhythmias might need the ability to bring in a full highly skilled team out of hours to diagnose and manage with interventional techniques. Scale of units matters to the extent that any unit needs to have sufficient scale to be able to offer the full range of services out of hours that might present as an emergency to that unit out of hours. Psychology and counselling Proposals that will ensure greater availability of psychologists are welcome. This must be reflected in the adult standards and not just children's. 38513 We were told that there is a need to connect with social workers to make sure families they are getting benefits they need. In one centre we heard from a specialist social worker who also offered counselling and psychological support. Play Play specialists are vital to ensure the child's development does not stop because they are in hospital Recruitment and retention Recruitment is challenging in some specialties and some locations. Specific initiatives beyond traditional recruitment practices have been successful. Specific concerns - Nursing - recruitment and retention of highly skilled and qualified nurses is critical and hard but we heard about a number of successful, less traditional approaches; the supply of paediatric nurses was a concern; turnover is high in London - people come for the experience then move on; the availability of PICU nurses was often seen as a capacity limiting factor; nurses are not a mobile workforce so any closures could mean a serious loss of experience and skill to the system; nurses are less flexible now because trained specifically for either paediatric or adult nursing. Cardiac surgery - retention was seen to have been adversely affected by the uncertainty. Given the small numbers involved staffing was seen as precarious. Scientists, cardiac technicians, physiologists - widespread concerns that curriculum changes resulting from modernising scientific careers meant that appropriate Masters level training is no longer available. Cardiologists - concern about whether it will be possible to attract high quality cardiologists to work in level 2 units, particularly in paediatrics. Clinician engagement and advisory group One member stated that changing the number of cases to 100 would make little difference to the surgeons but a lot of difference to the networks. One member stated that it is wrong, especially for adults, to count all cases as equal - some are much more complex. Provider engagement and advisory group Recruitment and retention Attracting cardiologists into Tier 2 services is challenging There may be different staffing issues in and outside London. Retention seems much more difficult in London - it is more difficult to fill vacancies at lower pay bands in London. It may be easier to fill medical vacancies in London. Competition between units will lead to more staff moves, as some posts are on higher Agenda for Change bandings than others. The group saw value in a dialogue about bandings. The draft standards propose new requirements for psychologists. While recognising that there is huge variability in availability, there was a concern that resolving this would bring a financial pressure. 38614 There has been little investment in adult services and so it is proving difficult to fill vacancies. This is exacerbated by the fact that there are no standards for adult congenital heart specialists. Need to look at what happened with nursing 10 or 15 years ago - need to link to universities nationally to deliver an adult congenital course. There may be an issue with ECHO as training has changed and people don't have the same skill set. There is a four year gap because of Modernising Scientific Careers - need to look at numbers going in to training as well as bandings. The review team could talk to HEE about the increasing demand for specialists at a time when they are moving towards generalised training rather than specialist. There may be an opportunity to introduce a new training module to Modernising Scientific Careers. Mobility of staff The group noted it would be possible to look at getting a passport. In addition, it may be possible to reach agreement for surgeons along the lines of locums in the standards. Clinical Reference Group Surgeon numbers and minimum activity levels The CRG discussed the appropriate size of surgeon teams. The surgeons were less concerned about this issue than the need to ensure that each surgeon undertakes enough procedures to maintain competence. They noted that if numbers of surgeons and activity levels were set then network bo undaries should be fixed to ensure that these levels are achieved. The timetable for reaching the activity levels required could be critical for some centres that don't reach these levels now but might in 10 years time. There was agreement that in order to provide on call continuity, cover and back up for illness etc, at least three surgeons at each centre should be an immediate requirement. They noted that most surgeons also agree that four surgeon teams are ideal. The minimum number of procedures per surgeon is an appropriate standard, and 125 an appropriate minimum. Out of hours Given the spread of sub-specialisation which is likely to increase CRG surgeons considered that the number of surgeons was not the only issue. Arrangements needed to ensure the availability of surgeons with the required skills: neonatal surgery (the most frequent out of hours emergencies), complex congenital operations and establishing cardiac ECMO. Emergencies out of hours are however rare. Specialist nurses The group considered that the number of specialist nurses in each network should be based on population to ensure that the number would rise in networks with bigger catchments. Psychology The group considered that a more prescriptive statement of required psychologist staffing was needed in the adult standards. 38715 NHS England website - comments Succession planning One comment from a former congenital heart surgeon stated that larger teams of surgeons was be tter for succession planning - departure of the senior surgeon through retiremen t, illness or moving abroad, could lead to significant interruption in continuity of the service. It takes several years to integrat e a new surgeon in to the team because new c onsultant s will not have undertaken most of the major proce dures when they are appointed. During that period they cannot play a full part in the on -call service. Two other commenters considered that succession planning was a matter that should be managed by each Trust without the need for a national review to sort it out. Those Trusts that wished to continue to provide a CHD service have to show that they are able to plan and meet all the needs of running the services. One commenter noted that this approach seemed overly focused on just one individual whereas surgeons work as part of a team and each member of that team provides a crucial role to the individual patients. ScHARR review Relationship between volume and outcome - mortality This review identified a substantial number of studies reporting a positive relationship between volume and outcome. While many of the studies show better patient outcomes when larger volumes of surgery are performed, this was not consistent and not all of the studies showed this. The relationship between volume and outcome is unlikely to be a simple, independent and directly causal relationship, but rather be a marker for other process and system factors. Welke clearly expressed the view that volume is likely to be a surrogate for the processes and characteristics of care systems that produce outcomes and that centre specific quality measures would be more informative than volume thresholds. Pasquali and Vinocur concurred with this view and suggested that service design decisions should be guided by a range of individual centre performance measures and not volume. There are consistent and clear messages within the literature reviewed about the danger of viewing volume in isolation. Furthermore, included studies also caution concerning the likely but as yet poorly understood interaction of volume with the numerous other clinical and structural dimensions that contribute to delivering high quality services and hence good outcomes. With centralisation comes a corresponding increase in volume as more cases are concentrated in fewer centres. It remains unclear whether the impact of volume on outcome is largely a consequence of higher volume units organising and providing a complex service with all the \"right\" components, or whether it remains an independent factor directly related to the advantages of dealing with a larger number of cases. The lack of any UK studies to contribute to the review indicates a serious gap in evidence relevant to service provision in the NHS. Despite the growing number of studies on the relationship between volume and outcome few studies have suggested what the optimum size of a CHD centre in terms of volume should be. 38816 ACHD Two studies found that adult CHD patients had better outcomes when operated on by paediatric surgeons in specialist children's centres. Two studies suggest a relationship between individual surgeon volumes and outcomes for adults with CHD -one study found outcome was associated with surgeon volume. Another found a similar association with adult procedure volume indicating the influence of expertise on outcome. Complex conditions Studies on single conditions or procedures were more likely to identify an effect of volume on mortality but these were focused on high risk conditions, such as Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome, and procedures, for example Norwood procedure. Even within these highly selected groups there was considerable variation in effect depending on procedure type and individual centre performance. It is possible that, for example, surgeon volume may be as important as centre volume for these complex cases. Hirsch suggested that a reasonable threshold for referral of children requiring Norwood procedure is centres doing at least 20 procedures a year and 10 procedures a year for arterial switch operation. These studies indicate the potential value of centralising or regionalising highly specialised services for very rare and complex cases. Relationship between volume and outcomes other than mortality The evidence is equivocal - some studies found lower complication rates in high volume centres; others found no association between volume and complication rates. Two studies found low volume centres were associated with longer length of stay. Two studies also assessed costs and both found a relationship of higher costs associated with low volume centres. Relationship between distance from specialist centre and outcome Two studies examined the relationship between distance from a specialist cardiac centre and mortality and both found no relationship between distance and mortality. National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research review Using data from 13 paediatric surgery centres, analysis of 12,186 episodes of care in paediatric heart surgery during April 2009 to March 2012 inclusive showed no significant univariate association between annual centre volume and 30-day survival outcome. No association was shown with distance from home. 38917 Section C: Facilities Children and Young People Events Teens and young adults There need to be forms of entertainment for all ages not just younger children (toys etc. in the waiting room) - to be used as more of a distraction than anything else. The playroom needs to be staffed as long as possible so children and young people can have more access to entertainment. Environment The rooms are boring and clinical - they need more of a personality (less intimidating) Cleanliness is paramount in all areas of the hospital - for all staff, parents and families Facilities for the parents could do with some improvement. Food The standard of food in hospitals needs to be higher - it's when you most need good, healthy, balanced food. One parent felt there should not be a McDonalds/Burger King in a heart unit - people are too easily tempted by fast food and it's a main cause/contributor of obesity/heart disease. (other parents had differing views) There needs to be a wider variety of food especially for people with: o Allergies o Intolerances o Religious restrictions It would be good if the canteen was open later - especially for parents who need to stay overnight in the hospital It would be good to have a kitchen on all wards so parents can bring food from home rather than buying everyday It would be good if there was somewhere that families can eat together (not fast food) WiFi There needs to be 24 hour access to Wi-Fi for all patients (both in and out) not only for entertainment purposes but so that older children can keep up with school work easily if they have to miss school for operations etc. It would also allow siblings to occupy themselves whilst at/waiting at the hospital. It could also benefit parents massively - they would have the opportunity to keep up with work or other family members during their time at the hospital. It could also be used as a way of keeping in touch with friends and family whilst in hospital - phones often have no signal in the hospital so Skype/Facebook/messenger programmes would be helpful. Accessibility There needs to be a space where children can put out of use wheelchairs There must be easy access for ambulances at the hospitals 39018 Transport Not all hospital buses are wheelchair accessible (re: pavements and curbs) There isn't enough disabled parking It's very expensive to park Discount [on parking] is great but needs to be better advertised School Wi-Fi is vital so that children can keep up with school work It would be great to run Skype lessons There should be a teacher that children can talk to about school work Vis its to CHD services across England and Wales The availability of good facilities makes a huge difference to patient and family experience. Specific facilities for teenagers and young adults (clinical and social) could be better developed. Hospitals should provide a \"how to find us/about us\" booklet with where to park/eat/sleep in case you use a hospital in a different city - local knowledge is invaluable. It is expensive to live in the hospitals - it is expensive to eat in the hospitals. Engagement and advisory groups No specific comments Clinical Reference Group No specific comments NHS England website - comments No specific comments ScHARR review No specific comments National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research review No specific comments 39119 Section D: Interdependencies Children and Young People Events No specific comments Visits to CHD services across England and Wales When done well, the relationship between maternity services, fetal and paediatric cardiology, fetal medicine, NICU and ACHD cardiology can make a real difference both to the care delivered and to patient experience. Having services for children and adults all on one site was considered by some to improve efficiency and to promote the sharing of expertise. Having services in the same location is not enough - they must work together with patient needs at the centre. Too often this is not the case in practice. Communication between specialties is not uniformly good Children with multiple morbidities need access to a range of specialties. It is not always possible to predict which other specialities will be needed. A lot of children require input not from just another specialist medical team but also from nurse specialists, therapists, dietician and so on. If a patient has to wait several days for an opinion that is not considered to be good care or a good service. Paediatric and adult CHD services must work closely together. There can often be beneficial learning across the age groups. Links are also needed with acquired cardiologists, aortic and mitral surgeons. Critical care (both childrens and adults) Capacity in PICU and ITU is often the pinch point. This is mostly about nurses not about estates Standards for ICU may not be in scope but its importance can't be ignored Clini cian engagement and advisory group One member suggested that the co-location standards had been set in a collegiate way 'to make sure that everyone can meet them' and there was not enough ambition. Patient and Public Engagement and advisory group Considered that co-location with antenatal care was important. Noted that the delivery of the response times envisaged in the interdependency standards would need robust agreements between hospitals; Provider engagement and advisory group Expressed a concern that the CHD interdependency standards no longer followed DH guidance that was still used for other specialties. 39220 Suggested that hospital activity data could be used to show how often other specialties were involved in the care of CHD patients, though it was also noted that the use of other services tended to be strongly influenced by their relative availability. Noted that services can be next door to each other and not speak to each other - it is about having positive relationships. Recommended that if triple co-location (ie. childrens CHD with other tertiary children's services, adult CHD with other adult tertiary services, children's CHD with adult CHD) is ideal, this is made clear in the standards. Clinical Reference Group Vascular surgery - it was noted that there are no paediatric vascular surgeons and also that in some hospitals other surgeons with suitable expertise are used instead, so recommended that the standard suggested should be amended to require paediatric experience and should say: 'vascular surgeon or other surgeon competent to undertake vascular/micro vascular repairs.' Paediatric Neurosurgery - the group considered the original standard proposed prior to amendment by CAP was more appropriate i.e. 30 minutes to telephone advice / four hours for bedside care or transfer of care. NHS England website - comments No specific comments ScHARR review The review found limited evidence on the effects of proximity of other services on mortality or the impact of volume on non-mortality outcomes. One multicentre study compared care in a cardiac PICU with other ICU and found no effect on mortality except for STS-EACTS 3 level cases and primarily in patients undergoing atrioventricular repair and arterial switch operations suggesting that potential benefits may only be applicable to specific patient groups. A second study conducted a single centre before and after study evaluating the impact of introducing a cardiac cardiac PICU and found a reduction in mortality and a bigger effect in reducing morbidity (wound infection and chest re-exploration). National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research review No specific comments 39321 Section E: Training and education Children and Young People Events Parents reported finding that new SHOs and other trainees need to understand better that there is a person not just a procedure. They can be so focused on getting the procedure correct they don't think about listening to the young person and understanding their unexpected expertise History taking with new clinicians can be laborious - so standard forms and some kind of hand held records - filofax record - portable record - like the red book - electronic would be preferable Visits to CHD services across England and Wales No specific comments Engagement and advisory groups No specific comments Clinical Reference Group No specific comments NHS England website - comments No specific comments ScHARR review No specific comments National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research review No specific comments 39422 Section F: Organisation, governance and audit Children and Young People Events Patients should not have to pay for files/patient information to be transferred from one hospital to another There need to be stronger links between GPs, hospitals, workplaces and schools so everyone is on the same page regarding the care of the patient Visits to CHD services across England and Wales One centre had a highly developed internal data analysis system used to drive quality improvement. Patient and public engagement and advisory group It was suggested that an unacceptable number of operations were being cancelled at short notice, causing distress to patients and families. But other group members argued that there is always a risk, in any health system, that surgical capacity will be required to perform more clinically urgent work. Clinical Reference Group The CRG considered that while it would take some time to develop robust documented clinical governance frameworks (standard F1) this should be tackled urgently. The CRG noted that standard F2 requires national reporting of adverse incidents but this does not exist at the moment, though the CRG agrees is extremely important. The methodology for reporting incidents regionally or nationally will need to be agreed and a national system for sharing serious incidents/learning established. The Network function in this regard is not clear. The CRG discussed alternative models to Peer Review that were effective but potentially less resource intensive.

Patients and parents lose confidence in the staff, parents become neurotic - trust is low when things go wrong Need clarity about how to raise complaints or give feedback Names on the beds should include mums, dads and guardians - \"my name is not \"mum \"\". One consultant was intimidating at first but this is a style the family got used to and they have a very good relationship with the consultant now. Explain the diagnosis better Need a care plan that is common throughout the country Information Need to offer more information to patients - especially regarding transition, consultations and how to live with congenital heart disease. Consultation letters that come through are too complicated - they need a glossary or to offer trusted websites for more information Patients are unaware to whom you can direct your questions at the Trust 39725 There needs to be a clear hierarchy within the hospital and a formal process for complaints There needs to be a national (or regional at least) register for people with congenital heart disease Misdiagnosis is a huge problem for many people with congenital heart disease - local hospitals/GPs need to be aware of symptoms and when necessary they need to refer patients to a specialist centre as soon as possible Communicate to patients that there are things they can do whilst in hospital - learning, reading, helping others Workshops for children on 'how the heart works' or something similar would be good so they know what's going on from a younger age and can take responsibility for their own care as well There needs to be more information given to young people about sex, drugs, alcohol, relationships, contraception, the possibility of children - this needs to be away from parents completely - many teenagers are uncomfortable speaking about any of these things in front of their parents and some don't even like the idea of speaking with their regular doctors Pre-op and Post-op care There needs to be more support for patients post op - not only dealing with medical issues but also things like depression/anxiety - a psychologist would be good at this point Much more explanation about what to expect, post surgical, all about the procedures so people are prepared Even individual words matter - parents who are told to say 'Goodbye' to children going to surgery find this very distressing. \"Goodnight\" has been used as a replacement in some places Out of hospital Follow on care very limited when leaving hospital Helping parents prepare for real life - preparation for life stages, schools, what do you say and how do you say it, thinking about making decisions about children and what they can do Working out how to get insurance for things like holidays Visits to CHD services across England and Wales The review team heard that children are individuals and this needs to be taken into consideration rather than applying a blanket rule - this particularly applies to people with special needs / learning difficulties Choice Patient choice was considered controversial by some. Some centres strongly affirmed the right of patients to make informed choices about where they would receive their care. Others favoured significantly constraining choice either because they considered that cardiologists knew where patients would get the best care and would refer accordingly or because constraining choice would make it possible to guarantee activity levels at surgical centres. 39826 Inpatients Where children have multiple medical needs parents are sometimes left to navigate specialties with no-one in overall control. When parents don't attend ward rounds and information from the ward round is not passed on they start to feel that they are not being told everything Communications between departments in a hospital and between clinicians and patients/parents need urgent and thorough improvement - it casts a shadow on good aspects of the care. The review team were told that it's important for the specialist centres to g et communication right: - between departments - pharmacy, dietetics, other specialties, and between nursing staff. This works well when a clinician takes the lead for a n individual patient. Outpatients When parents see a new doctor they have to explain the child's history again. The clinician may disagree with the last consultation - unsettling for patients. Facilities not always children / special needs friendly. Multiple visits sometimes close together to see several specialties are not satisfactory. It is very helpful when there is a liaison nurse at all clinic appointments Patients and parents get a lot of complex information at outpatient clinics. It is helpful when everything written down (including medications) to share with health professionals Discharge from hospital Transition between hospital and community care is patchy and scary - going from very supported to completely 'on your own'. It helps when hospital and community services connect before discharge and the hospital uses whatever means are available to communicate with local services - eg., red book, email discharge letter to GP, TTO letter. Arranging to meet community staff in the hospital before discharge - handover meeting with hospital and community staff and family - is also helpful. Some parents and grandparents had been trained to do CPR so they felt comfortable taking baby home Being discharged late in the day (whilst waiting for reviews, medications and so on) is bad. Parents taking a small baby home with a congenital heart disease need a lot of support. Poor communication between the specialist centre and local services causes unnecessary distress for patients . Arriving home with a new baby after several months in hospital means you have missed some basic things like: registering for child benefit, hearing tests, red book . Red book has a section for complex health needs - not always completed in the hospital - would be a good means of communication. Parents rely on nurse specialists to liaise with the schools to help the teachers understand the child's condition and therefore what the child is able to do 39927 Provider engagement and advisory group It was noted that the Somerville Foundation do a survey with patients in adult centres to check that services are addressing expectations. A similar survey for children's services would be helpful. Clinical Reference Group Ensure where it refers to patients in the adult standards that carer is added: patient/carers Top of page 3 - add to standard as follows: When referring patients for further investigation, surgery or cardiological intervention, patient care plans will be determined primarily by the availability of expert care for their condition. The cardiologist must ensure that patients and carers are advised of any appropriate choices available (including transplantation) as well as the reason s for any recommendations H 10 - Should state \"plain language\" not plain English NHS England website - comments No specific comments ScHARR review No specific comments National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research review No specific comments 40028 Section I: Transition Children and Young People Events The review team heard that in some cases experiences of transition had been unsatisfactory Not enough discussion - need someone to talk to who's been through it/has experience with CHD Not enough information given to patients about the transition period The Information offered comes in the form of a huge booklet which is daunting to read through Process so far poor - no conversations about transition, wasn't going to happen till 21 then suddenly with 2 weeks' notice child was moved without finally seeing the paediatric consultant all rather 'hush, hush' Very annoyed when their child was asked whether the old consultant didn't like him as had not said goodbye or anything. Poor experience with the cardiac liaison nurse. Transition needs to be dealt with better - helping them talk in grown up terms, understanding the technical language, designing the service for young adults. The review team heard a number of ideas for improving transition Needs to be a slow introduction from one to the other - meet the staff first and get to know the building/ward in advance There can't be an age limit - each patient is different - some should move early, others late, others never. Parents know how it should be done with a slow set up to transition and with the old and new doctor preparing. They can see that things should be different from how they are. and understood that it should be different to how it was Needs to be a better guide to transition so that all parties know what to expect. With children & adults who have more complex needs there needs to be more support to know how to manage the system, social and health care gets very complicated. As children and young people get older they may need support to make their own de cisions. Transition is difficult if you have other specific problems and managing this in transition is difficult. A lot more support is needed to enable transition and it needs to be tailored to the child's specific needs. Transition should depend on the individual rather than the age of the person Some considered it had been helpful to be at a hospital where the consultants look after adults as well as children In a unit offering both paediatric and adult services, parents appreciate the ability to retain the contacts with consultants and the clinicians that they have been involved with. Be good to think about how parental involvement is managed within transitio n Managing the transition and engagement with the parents as they get used to a different level of involvement in adult care and different facilities. Also needs to be a transition for parents - it's a big change for them as well 40129 Young adults need lifestyle advice, need to be able to talk to the cardiac liaison nurses about how manage a teen/young adult life about managing their condition. When everything is planned around school, and the consultant has explained the handover and families know how many meetings there will be with both teams and when they will go over to adult care, then transition is less worrying. A lot of people talked about the 'in between' nature of being a teen or young a dult and the need for a different approach and distinct facilities Transition was an issue for the young people 14 + - stuck between 2 worlds The review team heard about a young person who was admitted to an adult cardiac ward with mostly much older men, which was considered totally inappropriate for a young person of 18 who looks no more than 11. There should be a transition/young person's ward There is a need for something in the middle - teenage services. Need help finding further education opportunities, limbo of being over 16 in the educational system. Expectations of involvement are high from parents but older teens and young adults often have different ideas. Facilities need improving for young adults - like staying in the familiar surroundings in paeds but paeds not set up to deal with large bodies, having quiet spaces away from babies etc An older teen in paeds is an oddity. Some people told us about the particular difficulties of transition for young people with learning difficulties For families of young people with learning difficulties transition from paediatric care to adult care was expected to be very difficult as the things they enjoy were more paediatric based Visits to CHD services across England and Wales Transition was one of the most talked about subjects. Many centres had made efforts to improve the management of transition. It seems likely that too many patients are still lost to follow up at this stage. Patients and their families often found the prospect of transition daunting and the experience unsatisfactory. This is only partly to do with the management of transition. Often the problem is the nature of adult services which are organised very differently to children's services, the experience of which can come as a shock. Transition is especially difficult for patients with learning difficulties. A more flexible approach is needed for these patients and better support for them and their families are needed in adult services. The review team were told that the CHD standards need to connect with what is happening in transition nationally 40230 Joint working of adult and paediatric teams helps smooth transition for patients, and has the advantage that the clinicians will already know the patient and that the plans will have been developed for care beyond transition. The review team heard from patients that their relationship with their consultant and nursing staff is very important so transition requires time to build up the trust with new people. A number of things can help young people transition well: o Dedicated transition nurses o Young adult clinics o Transition days o To be able to speak to someone who has already gone through it if you want (buddy system) o Meeting the new consultant and ward staff before transition o Teenage and young adult wards Those who had been through transition urged that children and young people were told early about their condition and not to wait until transition as this was an added stress at that time. Engagement and advisory groups No specific comments Clinical Reference Group Standards need to include further wording regarding flexibility for older children e.g. those with learning disabilities in the paediatric setting to ensure appropriately timed transition. NHS England website - comments No specific comments ScHARR review No specific comments National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research review No specific comments 40331 Section J: Pregnancy and contraception Children and Young People Events No specific comments Visits to CHD services across England and Wales As care of patients with CHD has improved, pregnancy is becoming more commonplace, emphasising the importance of a close relationship between maternity and ACHD services, and the importance of decisions about place of delivery and the levels of CHD cardiology support available. Clinician engagement and advisory group A sub-group made a number of editorial improvements to the proposed standards: The first section should be re-titled 'Family Planning Advice' The standards for adult services use the word co-located to mean 'Women should be cared for at an obstetric unit at or close to (within 30 minutes) the network specialist surgical centre'. This should be spelled out in the standard. Standard J11 refers to a maternal medicine specialist. An obstetrician with a specialist interest in maternal medicine would also be an alternative. Standard J12 should also mention the obstetrician and midwife as members of the MDT. Clinical Reference Group No specific comments NHS England website - comments No specific comments ScHARR review No specific comments National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research review No specific comments 40432 Section K: Fetal diagnosis Children and Young People Events One parent said that she was glad that she didn't know until birth - she didn't want to be made to make decisions. Visits to CHD services across England and Wales Improving rates of fetal diagnosis Rates of fetal diagnosis vary considerably. National standards for screening programme to look for CHD at 18-20 weeks were only introduced in 2010. Many places have not yet fully implemented 2010 standards. Some units are struggling just to offer the 20 week scan consistently at all. New standards are expected next year that will improve detection rates. But standards alone will not solve things. There also needs to be: Training for sonographers: o There needs to be training and support for sonographers. o Sonographer training is underfunded. o Can't just do it once - needs regular top up. o Feedback on success rates can be helpful National anomaly register: o Need a national register to know how we're doing. o Able to audit performance of units and provide targeted training with scarce resource Wales has achieved higher levels than many parts of England and there may be important learning. Ultrasound scanning is packaged within the obstetric tariff. Incentives are not aligned to support improved practice. The fetal network is really important and needs to be closely linked. A number of services emphasised the importance of close working with in house and neighbouring local fetal medicine clinicians emphasised CHD detection is a good marker for the overall quality of the ultrasound service. Diagnosis and support before birth A lot of parents spoke about their experiences of finding out that their children had congenital heart disease. Parents were sometimes informed as a result of antenatal screening and sometimes the diagnosis was made after the child's birth. The review team heard that it was important that enough time and support were given for decision making and planning for delivery. The wait between 20 week scan where an anomaly is suspected and specialist scan is a hard time 40533 The scariest time is when you're pregnant - parents support each other because they know how other people feel The review team heard from one parent whose diagnosis changed after more sophisticated tests she was told it might be one thing and she could terminate the pregnancy, then at the next scan there was another diagnosis Specialist nurses are very important at this time - easy access is very important. Where detection was in local fetal unit there was not always access to the specialist nurse until after the birth. Parents liked the opportunity to speak to other parents and see other children with the same diagnosis Parents agreed that they liked to be able to speak to a variety of people including hospital staff, charities and other parents to be able to get as much information as possible. The review team also spoke to people whose diagnosis was missed antenatally who said that it is not good to miss the diagnosis antenatally. Antenatal detection offers parents the opportunity to speak to relevant people in the health service and to prepare for the birth, to visit the neonatal and paediatric critical care areas and meet the surgeons before birth Neonatal detection Experiences when the diagnosis was made after birth were distressing for parents. Where mothers suspected their baby was \"not right\" they were made to feel neurotic and \"fobbed off\" in encounters with the health service before the condition is detected. Some of the se parents reported that they were told that the symptoms they were describing were characteristics of a normal baby. This experience was not replicated in the specialist centres where their concerns were taken seriously and acted upon quickly. Screening for women with CHD The review team heard that one stop clinics for the high risk women works well Engage ment and advisory groups No specific comments Clinical Reference Group Current standards require that women with a suspected or confirmed fetal cardiac anomaly are seen by a fetal cardiology specialist within five working days of referral and if possible within two days. PPE reps advised that five days is too long from a patient perspective. Similarly having to wait 48 hours for contact with a specialist nurse feels far too long an d every effort should be made to limit the wait. The group also agreed that the ideal would be for women to be able to see both the fetal medicine and fetal cardiology specialists on the same day (while recognising that this may som etimes be difficult to organise and should not be allowed to introduce delay into the process). NHS England website - comments 40634 No specific comments ScHARR review No specific comments National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research review No specific comments 40735 Section L: Palliative care and bereavement Children and Young People Events One mother expressed frustration that during the care of her daughter the term palliative care was being used and no one explained what it meant - 'we're not stupid people - but it wasn't a word we were used to. We asked a nurse what it meant as we had heard it several times. The nurse went quiet and then said she would get a 'doctor'. Visits to CHD services across England and Wales No specific comments Provider engagement and advisory groups It was agreed that units could start using these standards immediately and that this could give useful feedback and on how they work in practice. It was noted that the Leeds review and local follow up has produced some good work on culture and communications. The families are keen that lessons are learned and that this work informs future thinking. The offer was made to share this with the group.

Engagement and advisory groups No specific comments Clinical Reference Group No specific comments NHS England website - comments No specific comments ScHARR review No specific comments National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research review No specific comments 40937 Other issues PICU Inconsistent nurse staffing means that parents feel the need: o to be at every handover o to tell the nurse about their child at hand over o not leave their child - days are very long and there is no chance of doing anything normal like washing their clothes Maternity / lactation care is missed as the focus is on the baby. The mother would like to be at baby's bedside (particularly difficult in Children's hospitals not on the same site) Inconsistent approach to parent involvement in caring for their child - some fully involved in feeds, nappy changing, bathing and others not, therefore are unprepared for the lower staffing levels on the ward Step down from critical care wards can be difficult - parents not always informed of or prepared for the ward routine on arrival eg., expectations are they have to provide more hands on care and either don't know that they have to do it, or have not been involved on the PICU and therefore don't know how to do it Parents can be up all night and need somewhere to catch a bit of sleep in the day without leaving the hospital Some things that help are: Getting parents involved with baby's care as early as possible Communication following ward rounds where parents are not present Inherited conditions The review team were told that inherited conditions cannot be ignored as they use the same resources as CHD. Care for adults with CHD Adult CHD will be enormous in the next 30 years. Must build a network approach because just can't handle it all within a single centre. The need is not for more surgical centres as the big bulk of work is OP and imaging. That needs to be excellent across the network. ACHD intervention numbers seem to be steady but ACHD surgery has risen steadily and it would be even higher if there was enough ITU capacity to bring the patients in . 60% of operations are re-dos, many have already had multiple operations. Even those that are not re-dos are not easy because after a life time of abnormal circulation it will be harder to repair than it would have been if done as a child. Interventions however need specialist skills and shouldn't be dispersed. Follow up probably manages to see 95% of complex patients but there are probably hundreds of less complex patients not being seen regularly. 41038 Expanded team as part of a strategic plan to cope with rising demand. Nurse led OP clinics Challenges are: Geography, IT, shared records, growth Embedding ACHD service within adult CV services gives open access to other adult cardiology as patients get older for arrhythmia, ischaemia etc. Patients find adult services difficult partly because adult services have gaps or the full range of services they need are not all available in one site. Support groups Where there was no specific support group associated with a unit, parents felt the lack keenly. There needs to be better promotion of support groups (a lot of parents and families weren't even t aware of the groups that are available at their trusts) It would be good if doctors recommended support groups to families - all the options or specific to the family's needs More away days and in hospital activity days should be available to patients and siblings It would be great if there was a 'Buddy Scheme' where you could meet older people who have gone through the same or similar things to you - volunteering There needs to be stronger connections between charities/support groups and the wards. Support networks essential for knowledge and support The whole experience can be very isolating Other young people with their parents (particularly those who had had diagnosis later in life 10 +) wanted to connect with young people like them that had been through the process of before Parents also wanted to connect - it appears that parents with very small children are instantly linked to the charity and support circuit - less so with teenagers Would be helpful to have more of a support network. It would be good if appointments were grouped by age so that you can meet people of a similar age while at hospital Continuity of care Having the same consultant/surgeon is very important Getting to know and being known by hospital staff makes hospital life easier Dosing advice is different at local hospitals - there needs to be continuity in all areas When doctors give different views and opinions Life Many of the children and young people that we met stressed that for them, the most important thing whilst in hospital is maintaining some level of normality. They wanted us to know that even though they have congenital heart disease, they have to stay in hospital and they need to have different procedures and operations throughout their lifetime, all they really want is what everyone wants, to enjoy the life they have. So, where possible, the hospital/NHS/staff should try and facilitate that through: Eating with your family 41139 Exercising/playing sports Seeing/making friends Playing/chatting Learning - school, studies, exams Having boyfriends/girlfriends Watching television/listening to the radio Having access to social media/internet/online resources Home comforts Ethnicity NICOR's analysis of data from 13 paediatric surgery centres ( 12,186 episodes of care in paediatric heart surgery during April 2009 to March 2012 inclusive ) showed that Asian ethnicity is associated with poorer outcomes (30 day post -operative mortality). T his is a statistically significant finding. Other categories of ethnicity (Black, Chinese and Other) did not have statistically different risk from the Caucasian category. Other factors beyond simple ethnicity may play a factor in this finding, such as de privation and a higher incidence of consanguinity which is associated with more complex congenital heart disease and therefore less good outcomes. 412 1 Paper NHS071414 BOARD PAPER - NHS ENGLAND Title: Update from the Board Task and F inish Group on the new congenital heart disease review . From : Rosamond Roughton, Interim National Director: Commissioning Strategy Purpose of p aper: To provide an update on the work of the Board Task and Finish Group for the new congenital heart disease review . Actions r equired by the Board : The Board is asked to: note the key issues; and note the progress of the new congenital heart disease r eview to date (\"One year on\" - Annex C) . 413 2 Update from the Board Task and Finish Group on the new congenital heart disease review Background 1. The purpose of this paper is to provide an update to the NHS England Board on the progress of the new congenital heart disease (CHD) review since the last update to the Board on 24 January 2014. Board task and finish group 2. The purpose of the Board task and finish group is to: provide strategic direction to the new congenital heart disease review on behalf of the NHS England Board; provide assurance to the Board that the work is aligned with the stated aims of the review and NHS England's other strategic priorities; advise the Board on particular issues in relation to the review and also on any decisions which the Board may be required to make; and where required, commission work and / or request further information from the review's programme board in order for the group to fulfil its function. 3. Since the paper was written for the NHS England Board meeting on 24 January 2014, the Board Task and Finish Group (the \"Group\") met on 7 January 2014 and 15 April 2014. The minutes of both meetings are attached as Annex A and Annex B to this paper . Key issues 4. When the Group met on 15 April 2014, members noted that the best case scenario for public consultation on the new set of standards for the whole lifetime pathway of care was July 2014. Since that meeting and following further work, the new CHD review team have concluded that the new timeline for the start of public consultation is now September 2014 . Though the Group has not met again at the time of writing this paper, members have received an update on the revised timeline and will discuss this in more detail at their next meeting on 23 June 2014. Recommendations 5. The Board is asked to note the Task and Finish Group's report on progress of the new congenital heart disease review and in particular the paper \"One Year On\" at Annex C. John Holden Director of system policy July 2014 414New Congenital Heart Disease Review Annex A 3 Minutes of the Board Task and Finish Group held on 7 January 2014 Present: Mr Ed Smith, Non-Executive Director (Deputy Chair) Ms Margaret Casely-Hayford, Non-Executive Director Mr Bill McCarthy, National Director: Policy Professor Sir Michael Rawlins, Chair of the Clinical Advisory Panel Apologies: Professor Sir Malcolm Grant (Chair) Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, National Medical Director In atte ndance: Mr John Holden, Director of System Policy Mr Michael Wilson, Programme Director Penny Allsop (Secretariat) Item Agenda Item 1 Welcome and Apologies The Deputy Chair welcomed everyone to the meeting and the apologies were noted. 2 Note of the last meeting The notes of the last meeting were agreed. The Group recognised the importance of transparency, and emphasised the need for papers and notes of its meetings to be made public. 3 Action log Actions in progress were considered. Action 5: The Group recognised the importance of distinguishing between evidence and judgment and was encouraged that the new review team are commissioning an independent evidence review. On this basis this action was closed. Action 7: The Group recognised the importance of this piece of work but understood that it cannot be undertaken at this stage. It was agreed that the action will be closed on this log, but will be tracked elsewhere so that it is addressed at the appropriate time. Action 8: This action related to the work as originally envisaged. The new review is focused on continual engagement and so the Group agreed to close this action. Actions 15 and 19 : The Local Government Association is keen to be kept up to date about the new review, but does not consider that it would be feasible to set up a national overview and scrutiny committee. The action was closed. Action 16. See item 4. Action closed. Action 17: The review team undertook to produce guidance on completing the agreed conflict of interest declarations 415New Congenital Heart Disease Review Annex A 4 Item Agenda Item ACTION Update action log as per discussion. ACTION Produce guidance on completing the agreed conflict of interest declaration form. 4 DRAFT Policy for managing conflicts of interest Action 16: The draft policy for managing conflict of interest was agreed, subject to there being a clear reference in the policy to the need to publish a register of interests. ACTION A clear reference to be added to the policy for managing conflicts of interest regarding the publication of the register of interests. 5 Programme Stocktake The Group received a presentation on progress to date (slides attached here). The Group acknowledged the size of the task and also the history involved. Specifically, the Group: supported the focus on standards and recognised the important contributions of the Standards Group and the Clinical Implementation Advisory Group ; was pleased to hear that the new review team has commissioned an analysis of future demand of CHD services up to 2025, but recognised that there may be some limitations due to the way in which CHD is coded, particularly in adults; and recognised the importance of the work on antenatal and neonatal detection rates. Recognising that the current focus of work is on standards and not the form of services, it was noted that it would be important to speak to Monitor in advance of any scenario planning/modelling and that it would be critical to engage with the Competition and Markets Authority. The Group discussed the importance of recruitment and retention of surgeons and asked the new review team as a matter of urgency to speak to the Royal College of Surgeons about training. The Group agreed the timetable as set out in the presentation, but urged the new review team to look at what work could be done in parallel, including scenario planning on what form services could take, without prejudice to any future public consultation. The Group asked the new review team to set out a more complete timetable as quickly as possible. ACTION Engage with both Monitor and the Competition and Markets Authority in advance of any scenario planning / modelling. ACTION The new review team to speak to the Royal College of Surgeons about training, as a matter of urgency. ACTION The new review team to look at what work could be done in parallel, including scenario planning on what form services could take, without prejudice to any future public consultation. 416New Congenital Heart Disease Review Annex A 5 Item Agenda Item ACTION The new review team to set out a more complete t imetable as quic kly as possible. 6 Update from the Programme Board Bill McCarthy noted that he has undertaken to ensure that the new review is adequately resourced. The Group supported this as a high priority programme for NHS England. 7 Update from the Clinical Advisory Panel Professor Sir Michael Rawlins ( Chair of the Clinical Advisory Panel ) provided a verbal update on the second meeting of the review's Clinical Advisory Panel (18 December 2013). The Clinical Advisory Panel (CAP) comprises a range of clinici ans from within and outside the CHD community. The meetings to date have been a success and the members of the CAP are getting to grips with the issues. The Group recognised the importance of CAP and suggested that Professor Sir Malcolm Grant might be invi ted to a future meeting. ACTION Professor Sir Malcolm Grant to be invited to a future meeting of the Clinical Advisory Panel. 8 Highlight report The report was accepted. 9 Any other business There was no other business Date of next meeting Wednesday 12 February 2014, 10:30am - 12pm, Maple Street, LONDON [THIS MEETING WAS SUBSEQUENTLY CANCELLED] 417New Congenital Heart Disease Review Annex B 6 Minutes of the Board Task and Finish Group held on 15 April 2014 Present: Professor Sir Malcolm Grant (Chair) Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, National Medical Director Mr Ed Smith, Non-Executive Director Ms Margaret Casely-Hayford, Non-Executive Director Mr Bill McCarthy, National Director: Policy Professor Sir Michael Rawlins, Chair of the Clinical Advisory Panel In attendance: Mr John Holden, Director of System Policy Lauren Phillips (Secretariat) Item Agenda Item 1 Welcome and Apologies The Chair welcomed everyone to the meeting. 2 Note of the last meeting The notes o f the last meeting were agreed (7 January 2014). 3 Declarations of Interest The Chair advised the Board Task and Finish Group that at the time that the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research (NICOR) was established he was the President and Provost of University College London (UCL). Professor Sir Bruce Keogh advised the Board Task and Finish Group that at the time NICOR was established he was the Professor of Cardiac surgery at UCL. 4 Action log All actions in progress were considered. Professor Sir Malcolm Grant confirmed that he would be attending part of the next meeting of the Clinical Advisory Panel on 18 June 2014. (Action 28) 5 Update and Assurance Process John Holden pointed out that though the Board Task and Finish Group had not met since 7 January 2014, as the meeting scheduled for February 2014 had been cancelled, John had circulated a note to members of the Group in the interim period to update them on progress. John introduced the item \"Update and Assurance Process\" which described 418New Congenital Heart Disease Review Annex B 7 Item Agenda Item the review's work and proposed approach for the key NHS England assurance groups. John explained that this is the slide set / paper that would be considered at the both the Women and Children's Programme of Care Board meeting on 29 April 2014 and the Clinical Priorities Advisory Group (CPAG) meeting on 30 April 2014. John drew the Task and Finish Group's attention to the following slides: Slide 8: Engagement and Advisory Group s The Board Task and Finish Group discussed what could be interpreted by \"interdependencies \", for example integrated, co -located, networked and agreed it was important to be really clear about what the review meant when it used the term. John confirmed that to date there had been a lot of consensus from the engagement and advisory groups about the importance of the standards based approach. He also explained that the review was now operating on a more stable basis than the situation which had been inherited . The Board Task and Finish Group noted that the large amount of engagement with those groups had put the review into a goo d position to move onto the next phase . John explained that through discussions with Local Government, NHS England's patient voice team and representative faith groups, there had been some further suggestions for engagement with people from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) groups who are disproportionately affected by congenital heart disease. The Board Task and Finish Group noted that further engagement work was required was required for BAME groups. Slides 10 , 11 and 12 : Revi ew methodology , evidence and assessing capacity John explained that the review's intention was to develop a single set of standards for the whole pathway of care which sets out the ideal. Alongside that the team is currently carrying out analytical wo rk to understand current and future demand and the implications for capacity requirements. This will be used with the other evidence, for example the work with NICOR, intelligence from the Trust Visits and the literature review. The Board Task and Finish Group requested that further detail and options relating to the recommendations on function, form and capacity of future services and the commissioning model should be brought back to a future meeting for a more detailed discussion. Slides 29 and 30: Consultation timeline John explained that the current best -case scenario is that the 12 week full public consultation could begin in July 2014. 419New Congenital Heart Disease Review Annex B 8 Item Agenda Item John noted that it was impossible to know how many responses to consultation would be received, though noted that the Safe and Sustainable consultation received approx. 75,000. As such, the current timeline had allowed 3 months for the analysis of any cons ultation responses, to amend the standards / specifications and, if necessary go back through the NHS England specialised commissioning governance. John explained that under the current arrangements, 6 months notice was to be given to p roviders which woul d mean that the new specification would not be commissioned until 2015/16. The Board Task and Finish Group acknowledged that this did not necessarily prevent NHS England encouraging providers to implement some changes and improvement to services during the notice period. Slide 31: Proposed pre -consultation engagement activity The Board Task and Finish Group noted with approval the proposed pre - consultation engagement activity. Slides 34 - 40: (CPAG) assurance process John explained that the review team intended to attend a meeting of CPAG at the end of April 2014 to provide a briefing on the work to date, clarify their assurance requirements and explain and test the review's proposed approach. John explained that slid es 35 - 40 were framed around the standard CPAG template (those assurances the review must satisfy CPAG on) as follows: 1. Governance and decision -making CPAG requires assurance that the review had been though the appropriate governance (both the review's own 'governance and also the NHS England specialised commissioning governance). 2. Stakeholder testing CPAG require s assurance that the review's stakeholde rs are familiar with the standards and that they believe a consultation is necessary. 3. Financial impact (see below) 4. Equality analysis CPAG requires a statement outlining the review's approach to equalities. Following discussion, the Board Task and Finish Group confirmed that it supported the review's proposed approach to assuring the CPAG on governance and decision -making, stakeholder testing and equality analysis. John drew the Board Task and Finish Group's attention to the work in relation to the finan cial impact (slides 38 and 39) and made the following points: The review is consulting on ideal and aspirational standards. It is unlikely that any current provider will be able to satisfy every 420New Congenital Heart Disease Review Annex B 9 Item Agenda Item single part of the new standards. Affordability, value for m oney and deliverability are important considerations, however a full / detailed financial impact analysis which takes into account potential changes to delivery of service, cannot be completed at this stage. The intention however is to provide some high le vel analysis now about the potential impact of this work, including a baseline of current spend and likely future cost drivers. The Board Task and Finish Group discussed and agreed that ideally the high-level financial impact analysis should set out: the best sense of the overall financial envelope at the present; those standards which, because they are extending the scope, will inevitably cost more (for example pre-natal screening); and those standards which are about improvements to existing services and therefore may potentially incur additional cost or even create reductions in cost due to better organisation or smarter processes. Standards must describe a high quality service but this did not of itself guarantee a \"blank cheque\" for every possible change. The Board Task and Finish Group discussed the relationship between costs and tariff and John confirmed that the current time lag between cost collection and tariff change is 3 years. The Board Task and Finish Group agreed that a meeting should be scheduled between Malcolm Grant, Bill McCarthy and John Holden to further discuss the approach to assurance. The Task and Finish Group agreed that it was important to provide a line of sight to the NHS England Board via an update to the meeting on 3 July 2014, including all the progress to date and current expected timescales for the review. ACTION Further engagement required with Black, Asian and Minority Ethic (BAME) groups. ACTION Discussion to be scheduled at a future meeting of the Board Task and Finish Group regarding the recommendations of function, form and capacity of future services and the commissioning model. ACTION Malcom Grant, Bill McCarthy and John Holden to meet to discuss assurance requirements. ACTION An update to be provided to th e NHS England Board in July 2014, detailing the progress to date. 6 Feedback from the engagement and advisory groups The feedback from the review' s engagement and advisory groups was noted. 421New Congenital Heart Disease Review Annex B 10 Item Agenda Item 7 Update from the Programme Board Bill McCarthy (Chair of the review's Programme Board) provided a verbal update on the last meeting of the review's Programme Board. Bill confirmed that following the recent business planning round, further financial resourcing had been secured for the new CHD review programme for 2014/15. Bill noted that in response to requests from the review's Patient and Public Group for a specific session on safety concerns, John Stewart (NHS England), Ted Baker (Care Quality Commission) and Nigel Acheson (NHS England) had attended the last me eting of the Patient and Public Group on 27 March 2014 to discuss this. The Board Task and Finish Group noted that the next meeting of the review's Programme Board was scheduled for 16 April 2014. 8 Update from the Clinical Advisory Panel Professor Sir Michael Rawlins (Chair of the review's Clinical Advisory Panel) provided a verbal update on the third meeting of the review's Clinical Advisory Panel (31 March 2014). This meeting had focussed on the latest iteration of the draft standards an d the associated \"knotty issues\". The Board Task and Finish Group noted that the next meeting of the review's Clinical Advisory Panel was scheduled for 18 June 2014. 9 Highlight report The Board Task and Finish Group noted the highlight report and reque sted sight of the risk mitigation associated with the key risks on the highlight report. ACTION Latest iteration of review's Programme Board risk register to be circulated to the Board Task and Finish Group. 10 Any other business There was no other business. Date of next meeting TBC 422New Congenital Heart Disease Review Annex C 11 One Year On: progress of the new congenital heart disease (CHD) review Executive summary The review has made progress against all of its objectives. In particular, the development of a single coherent set of standards provides the platform for commissioning an excellent service , and will help determine whether providers are able to meet our requirements. But commissioning an excellent service is not just about the location of surgical units. Our work to date will enable us to describe expectations of the service for the whole lifetime pathway of care; to set out a detailed understanding of current and future demand and the dri vers which affect it; to make information readily available on the quality of service; and to improve outcomes by ensuring earlier and better diagnosis. We had hoped to be consulting on standards by this point, but we have more work to do. The review has managed a constant tension between acting with enough pace to mitigate the risks of \"limbo\" (whereby investment is withheld, recruitment is difficult, service developments are stalled) versus taking enough time to give all stakeholders the opportunity to shape the future. \"Safe and Sustainable\" took four years and had a net cost of \u00a36m, but in the end the conclusions were not implemented because of concerns about the process. We are mindful of this and - despite the clamour for a quick solution - have resisted the temptation to take short-cuts in our process, our engagement or in our own internal assurance. The next steps in this work are to consult on and agree the standards and specification, complete the analytical work, and develop the functions & form and commissioning & change model. At that point we will be able to make recommendations to the NHS England Board. We expect that by the end of the 2014/15 financial year this will cease to be a dedicated \"task and finish\" project, and implementation will be mainstreamed as part of NHS England's wider commissioning of specialised services. Introduction - an \"implementable solution within a year\" In June 2013 the Secretary of State announced that he accepted the recommendations of the Independent Reconfiguration Panel (IRP), and was therefore setting aside the outcome of the \"Safe and Sustainable\" review of children's congenital heart surgery. The work had been led by a committee, acting on behalf of all primary care trusts, which no longer existed. He therefore asked NHS England, as the organisation now responsible for commissioning these services, to undertake a new review, learning the lessons of experience to date, including Judicial Review findings and the report of the IRP. The Board of NHS England, meeting in public in July 2013, discussed the issue (see link to paper). It was recognised that the new review was a vital opportunity to secure lasting improvements for some of the most vulnerable NHS patients. Reviewing such a high profile and sensitive service would be seen as a test of the way in which the emergent NHS England conducted itself, and our commitment to patient and public engagement, clinical leadership in every aspect of our work, and evidence-based decision making. The 423New Congenital Heart Disease Review Annex C 12 Board recognised the difficulties of conducting the review in a climate where trust had broken down and relationships needed to be rebuilt, but was nonetheless concerned about the risks to the congenital heart service due to continuing uncertainty and \"limbo\". Therefore the Board set an ambition that there should be an \"implementable solution within a year\". We have now reached the one year anniversary of the Board's challenge, and this paper describes the progress that has been made and what remains to be done. Overall approach - six objectives Stakeholders - especially patient groups and clinicians - told us from the start that to have any kind of constructive dialogue, we should \"take closure off the table\". In other words, we must find a way to discuss the issues without pre-supposing that some units must cease to provide services. Many told us that the threat of closure had led to an adversarial approach during the previous review, both in terms of engagement in the review, and even in the way that surgical centres behaved towards each other, to the detriment of patients. More positively, many stakeholders told us that the key to a successful outcome would be to build consensus around a set of standards, but that the standards should not be \"fudged\" - i.e. they should objectively describe the optimal model of care, without regard for the current service arrangements. At the same time, it became apparent to us that we needed a comprehensive understanding of historic activity, and the current and anticipated volume of services. Alongside a new set of standards for the whole pathway care - from fetal through children and adults - this would help us to understand the capacity requirements and the cost implications. Analysis of the historic data could help us to identify any relationship between the way services are organised and the outcomes for patients. In turn, the standards and capacity requirements would allow us to start to describe the functions and form of a congenital heart disease service for all patients in England, including issues not dealt with by the standards like access and geographical distribution. Taking all these points together, we were satisfied that we could legitimately \"take closure off the table\". We considered that in the absence of compelling, prima facie evidence that closing units was the only way to secure high quality services for the future, that the new review should have an open mind, develop standards of care and follow the evidence as it emerged. Once we had agreed the standards, examined the data and other evidence, and considered functions & form, only then could we have a meaningful dialogue with potential providers about how to meet our requirements, and whether any reconfiguration would be necessary. NHS England is a commissioning organisation and this strategic review is the front end of a commissioning process - defining the need, and considering the options. Provider organisations told us they wanted to understand and to help shape the approach to commissioning and change - any reconfiguration resulting from the review would affect all those involved and have implications for workforce, teaching, and of course for interdependent clinical services. Even if reconfiguration were not required, it was highly likely that providers would need to make changes to be compliant, and to network effectively. Finally, patient and public stakeholders, strongly endorsed by clinicians, told us they wanted better real time information to understand how the service was faring, to provide a quality safeguard and to inform patient choice. They argued that current data was overly- 424New Congenital Heart Disease Review Annex C 13 focused on one metric, for \"30 day mortality\" (i.e. post-operative survival), which showed that in the past decade (since the Kennedy Inquiry at Bristol in 2000) surgical outcomes had levelled up significantly so that across England these outcomes were now world- leading. But mortality is not the only indicator of good care, and does not reveal enough about other outcomes. They also told us that a really good service does not begin at the point that surgery takes place; it begins with early and accurate detection and diagnosis, through improved rates of antenatal detection, supplemented by improved neonatal detection. In January 2014 our Board was asked to consider and agree a set of six objectives for the review, which captured all of these different strands of work (see link to paper) . Progress against the six objectives would be the measure by which we could demonstrate progress against the Board's ambition for an \"implementable solution\". The following six objectives were agreed: Objective 1: to develop standards to give improved outcomes, minimal variation and improved patient experience for people with congenital heart disease; Objective 2: to analyse the demand for specialist inpatient congenital heart disease care, now and in the future; Objective 3: to make recommendations about the function, form and capacity of services needed to meet that demand and meet quality standards, taking account of accessibility and health impact; Objective 4: to make recommendations on the commissioning and change management approach including an assessment of workforce and training needs; Objective 5: to establish a system for the provision of information about the performance of congenital heart disease services to inform the commissioning of these services and patient choice; and Objective 6: to improve antenatal and neonatal detection rates. Range of services covered by the review Our Board had already decided, in July 2013, that the new review should encompass both adults and children's services, recognising that in practice they were inextricably linked, through shared staff including surgeons. Stakeholders - especially clinicians - told us this \"child and adult\" approach was essential, but it was a significant departure from \"Safe and Sustainable\", which had been asked to look at children's services only. This meant that without doing anything else, our work was already much broader in scope than the previous review. And there were more detailed questions of scope to be answered, for example whether and how to take account of interdependencies between services. It was important to get the balance right before asking the Clinical Advisory Panel (Chaired by Professor Sir Michael Rawlins) to consider and advise on the review's scope, because too broad a scope would make the review undeliverable; too narrow might mean that important dependencies were overlooked. Therefore we consulted our stakeholders for comment, and through this process we formally agreed the scope of our work on standards. 425New Congenital Heart Disease Review Annex C 14 Similarly, one of the most powerful messages we heard from our early meetings with patient groups was that the CHD service sometimes failed patients and families at their lowest ebb, when there was a poor outcome, or during palliative care, or following bereavement. This was about treating people with compassion and dignity, rather than a question of the technical skills of the clinicians involved. So, almost from our first meeting with patients, we decided that there should be a dedicated chapter in our new standards to deal with palliative care and bereavement. And throughout the standards there are references to the importance of open, honest communication. Finally, we have been clear that NHS England's focus is on commissioning services for the population normally resident in England. However, congenital heart surgery for patients resident in Wales invariably takes place in England, and so we have been factoring this in to our work, and considering where appropriate the relatively smaller cross-border flows with the other devolved administrations. Openness, engagement and decision making We began our work in June 2013 by meeting the national patients' charities, to get an overall perspective on the challenge. This immediately triggered concerns amongst local charities and patient support groups that their views were not being sought and would not be respected by the national charities. It was clear that relationships between some of the charities and patient groups had been left strained following the \"Safe and Sustainable\" process. Our early meetings with stakeholders were focused on giving everyone a chance to say what they felt about the recent history and their hopes for the future. This was essential to the constructive working relationship we have now, based on a programme of regular engagement events with three different groups each chaired by an independent representative of the group concerned . (Patient and Public Group chaired by Professor Peter Weissberg, Medical Director at the British Heart Foundation ; Clinicians' Group chaired by Professor Deirdre Kelly , Consultant Paediatric Hepatologist at Birmingham Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust ; and Provider Group chaired by Chris Hopson, Chief Executive of the Foundation Trust Network). We have sought to involve every constituency in these groups - every charity and patient support group, clinicians and managers from every hospital delivering specialist congenital heart care, and every linked speciality. We make sure that we offer all three groups a broadly similar programme so that there is consistent and comprehensive sharing of information, but we also adapt the agendas to reflect whatever those groups wish to discuss. Every meeting has its own character. All are robust in their debates and appropriately challenging to NHS England. They never allow us to forget that these are real issues that need to be resolved. For local government and Healthwatch representatives we have held a national plenary meeting (in Birmingham) and subsequently an update via W ebEx ; we have also attended Overview and Scrutiny Committee hearings around the country to explain the work of the review. We have attended two all-party parliamentary briefing sessions, and supported Department of Health ministers to answer numerous Parliamentary Questions. We have also attended various professional conferences - for example the national association of critical care managers. Over the Easter School Holidays in April 2014 we ran nine regional events around the country, specifically designed to hear from children and young people. Over 100 young people and their families told us their stories. And we have just completed a series of visits to every specialist congenital heart unit in the country, led by 426New Congenital Heart Disease Review Annex C 15 the chair of our clinicians' engagement and advisory group. As part of these visits we were able to hear from and talk to front-line clinicians, patients and their families and hospital managers, giving us a much richer understanding of their achievements and challenges. There is more work to do - especially to hear from adults with CHD, from black , Asian and minority ethnic groups, from people with learning disabilities and from bereaved families, all of whom have been relatively under- represented in our work to date. But as a result of this extensive engagement we feel we are in a good position to consult on a set of standards, and that there will be no surprises for any of our constituencies. The IRP report into \"Safe and Sustainable\" observed that there were perceptions of a lack of openness, and a suspicion that outcomes were pre-determined. The diagram at Figure 1 shows the governance arrangements we have established for this review, and in particular how our decisions are made, and how the different engagement and advisory groups feed in to the decision making process. We have shared this widely so that there is no confusion about the route by which the ultimate decisions are made - in particular, the pre-eminence of the NHS England Board and its \"Task and Finish Group\" (chaired by Professor Sir Malcolm Grant) dedicated to this project. But for reasons of simplicity and clarity the diagram does not attempt to show the full complexity of the governance arrangements which must be satisfied in order to consult on the new service standards, which require the involvement of a Programme of Care Board; the Specialised Commissioning Oversight Group; the Clinical Priorities Advisory Group; and the Directly Commissioned Services Committee of the main Board. Successfully navigating this governance without undue delay is one of the main challenges we face in consulting on standards in September 2014. One of the defining features of our work over the last year has been the approach we have taken to openness and transparency . In addition to involving the widest possible range of stakeholders, we have tried to make sure that everything we do is open to scrutiny, with a conflicts of interest declaration being widely rolled out, and a publications policy where the default is always that we publish everything. This is logistically difficult and can create tensions - often we are doing our \"thinking out loud\", and in public, and we are robustly challenged on ideas which have merely been floated, not finalised. But on balance the approach has been quite liberating. We publish all significant material, whether it is correspondence, agendas, meeting papers or minutes. We produce a blog every fortnight (there have been 25 in the year from June 2013) in which we describe what is happening and what is forthcoming, and we always feedback what we have heard and what we have done about it. Progress update against the objectives Objective 1 - standards From the beginning of the review's work, stakeholders told us that the best way to improve services was through clear service standards, uniformly applied. The creation of NHS England as a single national commissioner of specialised services presents an opportunity to drive high standards consistently in a way not open to our predecessors. Under the leadership of Professor Deirdre Kelly and with extensive cooperation from a range of clinical experts and patient representatives, a single coherent set of standards has been developed that describes the whole patient pathway from fetal diagnosis through children's services and adult services including transition and pregnancy. This builds on two discrete sets of pre-existing standards, 427New Congenital Heart Disease Review Annex C 16 and a third which was underway; all have been fully reviewed, refreshed and further developed. There is an increased emphasis on good communication with patients and their families and a new section covering end of life care and bereavement. Responding to the challenge set by Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, the standards aim to describe an excellent service, not just best fit with current practice. This has been a lengthy, complex and testing exercise, to harmonise a large number of standards which had previously been organised and expressed in different ways, and grappling with some of the most \"knotty\" issues. The draft standards will be subject to full public consultation later this year: our target date has slipped from July 2014 to September 2014 and we have been criticised for the delay, which is due to the production of the consultation materials, and the challenge of clearing the internal assurance process referred to above. One issue to be tested in consultation will be the potential trade-offs required if, in meeting the standards at all specialist units, the standards were to be considered unaffordable. Possible approaches could include a longer timetable, commissioning from fewer units (to achieve economies of scale), lowered expectations for those standards associated with higher costs, or focusing on a smaller set of \"must do\" standards. The standards, once agreed, will form the basis of NHS England's service specification which we use for contracting. The standards will be challenging and it is not expected that any provider meets all the standards currently. Some of the standards will be developmental, so a timetable for reaching them will be set out. The Clinical Reference Group (CRG) responsible for congenital heart services has worked with the new CHD review team to develop the draft service specification and timetable for developmental standards. Once agreed, the specification will become the basis for NHS England's commissioning of CHD services and all providers will be expected to meet the standards. In addition to the work described on developing standards for CHD services, the review will work with colleagues from NHS England and the relevant CRGs to develop standards for extra corporeal life support services (including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ) and referral pathways and criteria for CHD patients who could benefit from cardiac transplant. Objective 2 - analysis In order to commission CHD services effectively, NHS England needs to understand the demand for services now and in future. Clinicians and hospitals providing CHD services have told us that they expect the growth in paediatric activity seen over the last ten years to continue in future. The number of adult patients with CHD is now believed to exceed the number of children with CHD for the first time, and the number of adult patients is expected to continue to rise. For adult services we have two sources of data available on current inpatient activity, but both are flawed for different reasons. Not all adult activity is reported to the national database run by the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research (NICOR), and the generic nature of Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) means it is not easy to distinguish CHD activity from other cardiac services. No comprehensive assessment of expected changes in future years has previously been available for both children and adults. The review's analytical team has worked with clinicians, NICOR and NHS England's lead commissioners from national and area teams to define a set of procedure codes that most accurately describe CHD 428New Congenital Heart Disease Review Annex C 17 inpatient activity. Data from the NICOR database and the HES data set are being analysed and compared to give the best understanding possible of current activity as well as trends over the last ten years. By the end of July 2014 we aim to have the first evidence-based projections of activity for children's and adults' services, modelling two different scenarios for growth (population only, and population plus other factors). The emerging analysis already confirms our understanding that beyond those centres providing specialist CHD services, a larger number are involved in providing care for adult patients, mostly undertaking lower numbers of procedures, which raises questions about the incidence of \"occasional practice\". Our public and patient stakeholders representing adult patients have told us this is a significant concern for them. Objectives 3 and 4 - function, form & capacity and commissioning & change The review will move beyond standard-setting and activity analysis to make recommendations for the shape of the CHD service of the future. It will also consider possible approaches to commissioning those services to ensure that everyone has access to excellent services that meet the service standards, and that occasional practice is eliminated. The preparatory work is already underway, but we cannot pre- judge the outcome of the standards and analytical work. The review is working with colleagues from across NHS England to develop an approach that helps to inform similar work on other specialised services. Engagement with our provider leaders' group has highlighted the importance of any change programme taking account of research, training and workforce implications, and the need to have some explicit recognition of the cost of any substantial change. We intend to describe the necessary components of a commissioning approach to facilitate the emergence of regional, collaborative, provider-led solutions, including the potential for the development of formal joint approaches that also meet the necessary requirements of competition and choice. The standards will establish some important parameters for future services including the minimum levels of surgical and interventional activity required (because of the requirements for teams of surgeons and interventionists and minimum activity requirements for each of these groups to assure continued competence). This will be taken into account along with considerations of access, changing demand, affordability and other parameters in making these recommendations. Objective 5 - better information The IRP in its review of the work of \"Safe and Sustainable\" noted that high quality, accessible and understandable information to inform decision making was lacking. The review will therefore ensure that better information is available for commissioners and to inform patient choice. As a first step, we have worked with lead commissioners from regional teams to institute the use of a children's congenital heart \"transition dashboard\". This was originally specified to manage risks in the period when it was expected that \"Safe and Sustainable\" would be implemented. Despite implementation not taking place, the transition dashboard still provides a mechanism to test the current health of the system, by collecting specific information on defined aspects of the children's congenital heart services in England. And in line with other specialised services, the 429New Congenital Heart Disease Review Annex C 18 CRG for Congenital Heart Service has developed a quality dashboard covering a range of measures, which will be the enduring approach to real time quality monitoring. Although the quality dashboard has been introduced for 2014/15, it has been agreed that the transition dashboard will remain in situ until further notice. The review is also working with NICOR to consider how the information it produces can be improved. We will work with them to consider how a wider range of outcomes (beyond mortality) could be reported. We will also work with them to develop ways of presenting the information which would be easier for patients to interpret and allow them to make informed choices. Objective 6 - early detection Abnormalities of the heart are the most common congenital defect and yet rates of diagnosis before and immediately after the baby is born are not as high as they could be. Clinicians tell us that earlier diagnosis can lead to better outcomes throughout a patient's lifetime, more informed choice, better managed births and better experience for families. The review has brought together a wide range of stakeholders with an interest in early diagnosis to better understand the reasons for current low antenatal detection rates and to develop plans for addressing these. Early work suggests that better training and support for ultra-sonographers undertaking antenatal scans will be important. We will work with Health Education England (HEE), providers and thir d sector partners to consider how this, and other potential issues, could be addressed. Stakeholders have also told us that the lack of a consistent, national database for recording all congenital defects is a further significant problem. Without this it is not possible to be sure about the rate of antenatal diagnosis. We are in discussion with Public Health England (PHE) who will be developing and implementing a new national database which is expected to be functional by April 2015. The National Screening Council (NSC), now part of PHE, recently consulted on the efficiency of pulse oximetry, a simple test to measure oxygen saturation levels in new born infants which can help to identify potential congenital heart problems. The evidence was not conclusive and so the NSC has announced that it will be running a pilot programme to better assess the effectiveness of pulse oximetry and the related implications if it were to be specified as part of the new-born infant physical examination (NIPE). This will help to address longstanding concerns in this area, and the review will stay close to this work as we are very supportive of the evidence- based approach. Conclusion and next steps The review has taken seriously the Boards' ambition for an implementable solution to be delivered within one year. Early work with stakeholders made clear that the scope of the review needed to be wider than originally envisaged and that a new approach would need to be developed, retaining what was useful from earlier processes (e.g. the work on standards for children's surgical centres) but with no pre-conceptions about a particular \"answer\". The review also needed to rebuild trust, and this has been successful because in large part it was not rushed. In the year since we were asked to take on this challenge, 430New Congenital Heart Disease Review Annex C 19 NHS England has invested significant time and effort in working with public and patients (and their representatives), clinicians from provider organisations and national bodies, and provider leaders. We have been very open in our processes and maintained a constant account of what we are doing, publishing all relevant documentation at every step of the way. Taken together, these factors have made it hard to meet the ambitious timeline originally envisaged. Good progress has however been made on all of the review's objectives, especially in the development of standards for the whole lifetime pathway. Plans are well advanced to consult on these standards, but there remain significant risks, and our current expectation is that consultation could commence in September 2014, subject to approval by NHS England's internal assurances processes. This could then mean that the review would be able to make recommendations to the NHS England Board on all six objectives at the end of the financial year. 431New Congenital Heart Disease Review Annex C 20 Figure 1: Decision making, advice and engagement 432New Congenital Heart Disease Review Item 9 1 Scope and Interdependencies Introduction 1. The new Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) review has been established to consider the whole lifetime pathway of care for people with congenital heart disease. In order to conduct the review and to ensure that there is a manageable programme of work it is necessary to define its scope in more detail. 2. Patients, clinicians and the public have been asked to advise on what services and conditions should be included in the scope of the new review. Approximately 40 responses were received (these will be made available to the Task and Finish Group in hard copy for reference). 3. NHS England originally proposed three categories (in scope; out of scope; to be determined). It was apparent from the responses received that not enough explanation had been given to respondents which had led to some misunderstanding of the concept of scope. It was also apparent that the reality is more complicated than a simple 'in' or 'out'. There are multiple, complex interdependencies, so this paper recommends a less binary, more nuanced approach that explains how the review relates to a range of other services and conditions, rather than simply declaring them to be either 'in' or 'out' of scope. At the same time, it is important to define the boundaries in such a way that there is a realistic prospect of completing the review and avoids mission creep. 4. A paper was written for the Clinical Advisory Panel summarising stakeholder responses. Members were also provided with the full original responses for reference. The panel met on 15 October 2013 and considered the scope of the review. This paper reflects that group's recommendations. 5. It will also be necessary to consider the relationship of the review to the devolved administrations and the potential impact on services for congenital heart disease offered in those countries and used by their populations. Cross-border flows are significant and need to be taken into account. The NHS in each of the devolved administrations will therefore be asked to agree their relationship to the review and appropriate channels of communication. Summary recommendations 6. In summary the panel recommends that: A. The heart of the review should be the whole lifetime pathway of care for people with congenital heart disease, and specifically congenital heart disease services. B. There are a number of clinical conditions which while not CHD receive their care wholly or mainly from congenital heart services . The standards for services for these conditions should not be reviewed as part of the review (though the standards being developed may address aspects of the service). However, patients 433Item 9 2 who fall within this category use congenital heart services and should be able to participate in the review. C. There are a number of services beyond congenital heart services that CHD patients may use. Some of these services are reliant on clinical support or backup from CHD specialists. The standards for these services should not be reviewed as part of the review. However, the use of these services by congenital heart disease patients should be considered by the review, including the definition of clinical pathways and referral routes. Any impact of changes recommended by the review on these services should be considered prior to decisions being taken and during implementation. Patients and specialists from these services should be able to participate in the review. Detailed recommendations 7. Based on these principles, the Clinical Advisory Panel recommends that: In scope 8. The heart of the review should be the whole lifetime pathway of care for people with congenital heart disease, and specifically congenital heart disease services. This means: a) Improving the quality of care of people with suspected or diagnosed congenital heart disease (including those with congenital heart arrhythmias or arrhythmias in the context of congenital heart disease) along the whole patient pathway: Fetal and neonatal diagnosis of CHD Specialist obstetric care (including both care of women whose unborn child has suspected or confirmed CHD and care of pregnant women with CH D ) Care for babies, children and young people Transition from children's services to adult services Care for adults End of life care b) Cardiac and respiratory extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for children and young people . c) Care and support for families suffering bereavement and / or poor outcomes from surgery or other intervention for congenital heart disease. d) The review covers all care for congenital heart disease commissioned by the NHS for people living in England. 434Item 9 3 Interdependencies 9. There are a number of clinical conditions which while not CHD receive their care wholly or mainly from congenital heart services. The standards for services for these conditions should not be reviewed as part of the review (though the standards being developed may address aspects of the service). However, patients who fall within this category use congenital heart services and should be able to participate in the review. This means: a) Children and young people with acquired heart disease b) Children and young peopl e with inherited heart disease (for which a separate service specification has already been developed). 10. There are a number of services beyond congenital heart services that CHD patients may use. Some of these services are reliant on clinical support or backup from CHD specialists. The standards for these services should not be reviewed as part of the review. However, the use of these services by congenital heart disease patients should be considered by the review, including the definition of clinical pathways and referral routes. An y impact of changes recommended by the review on these services should be considered prior to decisions being taken and during implementation. Patients and specialists from these services should be able to participate in the review. This means: a) Neonatal, paediatric and adult intensive care unit (ICU) services, and transport and retrieval services. b) Other interdependent clinical services (for example other tertiary paediatric services). c) Mechanical circulatory support for adults including cardiac ECMO and VAD. d) Complex tracheal surgery. e) Heart transplant and bridge to transplant services for children and young people. f) Heart transplant for adults. Out of scope 11. Adults with inherited heart disease It was recommended that this group be excluded from the review because these patients do not receive their care from congenital heart services. 12. Adult respiratory ECMO It was recommended that this service should be excluded from the review because it is not dependent on congenital heart services, and operates independently of ACHD services. 13. L ocal maternity services It was recommended that local maternity services should be excluded from the review. Rather, the review should include specialist cardiac obstetric care (see 7a) above). 435 "}
