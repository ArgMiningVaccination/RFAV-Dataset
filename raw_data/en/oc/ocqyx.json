About Hepatitis B Hepatitis B is one of the world's most significant infectious disease threats with more than 290 million people infected globally. HBV infection is the leading cause of liver disease and, with current treatments, it is very difficult to cure, with many patients going on to develop liver cancers. An estimated 900,000 people die each year from complications of chronic HBV such as liver decompensation, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. About [Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant)] PreHevbrio is the only 3-antigen hepatitis B vaccine, comprised of the three hepatitis B surface antigens of the hepatitis B virus - S, pre-S1, and pre-S2. It is approved for use in the United States, European Union/European Economic Area, United Kingdom, Canada, and Israel. The brand names for this vaccine are: PreHevbrio (US/Canada), PreHevbri\u00ae (EU/EEA/UK), and Sci-B-Vac\u00ae (Israel).

U.S. Important Safety Information (ISI) Do not administer PreHevbrio to individuals with a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of any hepatitis B vaccine or to any component of PreHevbrio. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision must be available to manage possible anaphylactic reactions following administration of PreHevbrio. Immunocompromised persons, including those on immunosuppressant therapy, may have a diminished immune response to PreHevbrio. PreHevbrio may not prevent hepatitis B infection, which has a long incubation period, in individuals who have an unrecognized hepatitis B infection at the time of vaccine administration. The most common side effects (> 10%) in adults age 18-44, adults age 45-64, and adults age 65+ were pain and tenderness at the injection site, myalgia, fatigue, and headache. There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women who received PreHevbrio during pregnancy.
