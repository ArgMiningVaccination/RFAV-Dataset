A novel telehealth service was introduced across Northern Ireland by all five HSC Trusts (NHSCT, SHSCT, BHSCT, WHSCT and SEHSCT) on 9 December 2011. This report addresses a recent evaluation of the service, with particular reference to four target conditions: COPD, diabetes, heart failure and hypertension. The service is provided by a private contractor TF3. 2. The research utilised a mixed methods approach, involving (i ) analysis of administrative data provided by TF3, (ii) linked data on healthcare service utilisation , obtained via the Honest Broker Service (HBS), (iii) data obtained via a questionnaire survey of service users and (iv) qualitative data collected via either focus group discussions or interviews with service users, their carers and healthcare professionals (telehealth key workers, community pharmacists, GPs, hospital doctors). 3. From the initiation of the service until 29 May 2015 there were 4216 referrals t o the service (3944 patients). For COPD, diabetes, heart failure and hypertension there were 1046, 825, 295 and 38 patients respectively referred to the service. 4. Uptake of telehealth was highest in the NHSCT and lowest in the BHSCT, with 1228 and 456 refe rrals respectively. Each of the HSC Trusts had a different focus on referrals to the telehealth service e.g. referrals for weight management were highest in the NHSCT, whereas the SEHSCT and WHSCT had high numbers of patients referred for diabetes monitori ng. The highest number of referrals for COPD also came from SEHSCT. 5. The majority of patients were referred once only, with only 254 being referred more than once. Referrals covered all age groups. Patients within the youngest age group (0-19 years) were referred primarily for weight management while those in the oldest age group (80-99 years) tended to be referred for COPD and heart failure management . 6. The qualitative results showed that patients (and for the most part their carers) were overwhelmingly supportive and positive about the service, especially in relation t o the reassurance (peace of mind) the ongoing monitoring provided to themselves and their carers. There was strong support from patients for continuation of the service; they indicated that their knowledge and insight of their illness improved and the service incentivised self -care. 7. Healthcare professionals were generally supportive of the service but were more guarded, calling for more evidence of effectiveness. This was particularly true f or those healthcare professionals who were not directly engaged with delivery of the service. 8. The quantitative results indicated that health related quality of life and self -efficacy (ability for self - care) were at the lower end of the expected range for the target conditions suggesting the cohort of patients being managed had high morbidity. 9. There was no evidence within the dataset of any marked impact of telehealth services on hospitalisations and hospital based service usage. Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 10. The data indicated that m ortality was lower in patients who had the service initiated compared with patients who had been referred for the service but who did not have the equipment installed , particularly within the first year after the referral date. This was most marked in the COPD and heart failure groups. Although tempting to infer that the results are indicative of the alerts generated by telehealth monitoring facilitating the early implementation of life saving interventions, it is likely that at least some of these patient s did not have equipment installed because they had become morbidly unwell . 11. The main limitation of the research is that the work evaluated a service that was already established without a robust control group and largely depended on routine administrative information rather than data collected to standards generally put in place for research purposes. The study was also limited in scope, i.e. other telemonitoring services e.g. weight management were not included in the main aspects of the evaluation. 12. It is recommended that future telehealth services are taken forward within a complex intervention framework (rather than simply self -monitoring) with formal education provision on disease state, medication management , management of anxiety and depression, and se lf-management of symptoms and furthermore that outcomes data (for research purposes ) are collected alongside the delivery of the programme , such as those needed to undertake an interrupted time series analysis. Such a programme should include strict protoc ols for patient selection so that only those patients who are likely to gain benefit from the service, receive the service.

Background Telehealth is the use of a variety of sensors and devices to monitor remotely ( usually at home) health - related parameters in patients. This usually involves telephone or internet -based technology, to allow care providers to monitor information on patient vital signs. Deviation of the latter from the patient's norm alerts the healthcare provider to the possi ble need for inter vention. Since the monitoring becomes routine, and since patients are empowered to be more active in their own self -care, interventions can be introduced in a timely manner, with the intent of preventing, for example, the need for the pat ient to seek emergency hospital care. A number of telemonitoring research studies have been published in recent years across a range of common chronic health conditions, including hypertension (Parati et al., 2009), heart failure (Inglis et al., 2010; Den dale et al., 2012, Odeh 2105 et al, Steventon et al. 2016), respiratory conditions COPD and et al., 2012, Odeh et al. 2015, Rixon et al. 2015, Steventon et al. 2016) and diabetes (C ho et al., 2009 ; Steventon et al. 2014, Steventon et al. 2016). Under study conditions, some very posi tive outcomes have been reported, such as significant decrease s in mortality and hospitalisations in a heart failure group (Dendale et al., 2012). However, the positive results in that study (n=160 patients) were not reflected in a larger study of 1600 patients ( Chaudhry et al., 2010). The largest randomised trial to date in the UK is the Whole System Demonstrator project. This study involv ed more than 6,000 patients (in Kent, Cornwall and Newham) and was completed relatively recently. Again, the results have been mixed, with a decreased incidence of hospital admissions and mortality in the 12 month follow -up period in the telemonitoring gro up, while the number of elective admissions, outpatient visits and emergency department visits decreased, but not to a statistically significant extent (Steventon et al., 2012); quality of life or psychological outcomes were not improved (Cartwright et al., 2013) and cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) was similar in each group due to the higher total costs of the telemonitoring intervention (Henderson et al., 2013). The lack of consistent positive findings across published studies has slowed the up take of what intuitively should be a beneficial approach to patient care at home. Alongside the objective data, subjective views of patients on telemonitoring have generally been positive, while healthcare professionals are more cautious in their acceptanc e of the approach. Typical of such findings are those in a report on patient and healthcare professional views on a heart failure telemonitoring service in Scotland. In that study, telemonitoring was popular with patients who were reassured by the ongoing surveillance, while professionals commented on increased workload, the importance of case selection and the need for adequate training of themselves and of their patients (Fairbrother et al., 2013). The Centre for Connected Health and Social Care (CCHSC) in Northern Ireland launched the Telemonitoring NI project in 2011. This continues to be implemented by all five Health and Social Care (HSC ) Trusts in the province and across a range of chronic conditions. The programme was implemented as a 'natural exper iment' without a formal evaluation plan, rather than as a randomised trial or other formal prospective design such as a controlled before and after study or an interrupted time series. The present project relates to an evaluation of the impact of this prog ramme, which has Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 2 received significant attention across Europe. Telemonitoring NI is a service encompassing both telehealth and telecare programmes . These programme s are delivered by the TF3 consortium (Tunstall, Fold and S3) in collaboration with the five HSC Trusts (HSCNI) , i.e. Belfast, Northern, South Eastern, Southern and Western Health and Social Care Trusts (B HSCT, NHSCT, SEHSCT, SHSCT and WHSCT) . Both programmes provide remote monitoring services for patients in their homes through the use of a variety of technologies. The uptake of the services a cross the different HSC Trusts is driven largely by the level of engagement / interest of referring clinicians . Telehealth is provided to patients with a range of chronic conditions , e.g. diabetes and CO PD, and involves the use, by the patient , of home monitoring devices , with the results of such monitoring being made available via telephone / internet connection to a triage team and/or other healthcare providers. The telehealth programme is divided into two streams : (i) Triage and (ii) Track & Trend (Figure 1) . The former involves daily monitoring, with alerts being sent directly to a triage team (nurses) who decide on what action is necessary . Track & Trend monitoring , on the other hand, may be less frequent than daily. T he system does not send alerts to the triage team, but instead the profiles of patient data, e.g. profile of blood sugar levels over time, are viewed directly by the healthcare professional who is responsible for the patient's care , and who can review trends within the data and mak e interventions as appropriate. The telecare programme uses a different approach and serves a different purpose. It involv es the use of sensors placed in patients' home s to allow detection of eve nts, such as smoke in the kitchen, front door left open or patient has had a fall . Outputs from these sensor s are monitored remotely by the telecare team who can provide assistance to patients, as required, either by telephone or via the emergency services. Figure 1 Diagrammatic representation of the services delivered under the Telemonitoring N. Ireland umbrella 5 Health Trusts Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 3 The present evaluation involved analy sis of patient data held by the service provider ( TF3) and the HSC Trusts , together with additional data collected from patients and their healthcare providers ( through patient completion of questionnaires ; participation of patients in focus groups and of their healthcare providers in interviews regarding the value of the programme from their different perspectives ). Carers also took part in this latter aspe ct of the work if the patient was not able to provide self -care. Both telehealth and telecare have the aim of identifying patient problems in real time through the home deployment of monitoring devices and sensors. This remote monitoring facilitates the initiation of appropriate interventions quickly and ahe ad of the situation escalating. In telehealth , for example, an intervention may involve the escalation of diuretic dosage in a heart failure patient to deal with developing fluid overload and thereby prevent the need for hospitalisation. Telecare, on the other hand may involve alerting emerging health services, for example, if a patient has a fall. The telehealth programme is the focus of the main body of this report, while t he evaluation of telecare provision in Northern Ireland forms a supplement to this report. The results of the research overall will inform the process of continuous quality improvement of these remote surveillance services and inform future developments of the service s. 2. Aims and objectives The primary aims of the project were: (a) to construct a descriptive summary of the ongoing telehealth NI programme, (b) to evaluate the impact of the programme on healthcare resource usage (for example, hospitalisations) and patient self-efficacy / ability for self -care and (c) to determine the views of patients, their carers and healthcare professionals on the telehealth service. The specific objectives were to: 1. Using routine administrative data collected by the provider (TF3) as part of the service provision , together with datasets held in the Business Services Organisation (BSO) , provide a descriptive summary of the services delivered from the time of initiation of the service to the present time. 2. Through the conduct of retrospective and prospective surveys of patients who have received or are currently receiving the telehealth service , evaluate its impact on health -related quality of life and self-care (self -efficacy) for specific target conditions, i.e. heart failure, COPD, hypertension and diabetes . 3. Using data held by TF3 and the HSC Trusts, compare healthcare utilisation (hospitalisations, emergency care) by patients pre - and post -use of the service and by patients who received the service versus those who were referred to receive the service but for some reason the equipment was not installed in their home (e.g. patient declined the service or were found to be unsuitable). 4. Conduct qualitative research (focus group discussions) to gather information on the views and experiences of telehealth service users . Interviews with a number of stroke patients and their carers will form an additional group within this objective. 5. Conduct interviews with a range of healthcare professionals who are directly involved in telehealth provision (or who have the potential to be involved in the future) to gather information on their views to this new approach to community based care. 6. Conduct a health economic analysis on the telehealth programme . Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 4 3. Rese arch overview 3.1 Permissions required As with all research involving patients and healthcare professionals , a range of permissions were required to allow access to data, to conduct surveys and to carry out focus groups and interviews. The various permiss ions obtained included: ethical approval from the Office of Research Ethics Committee Northern Ireland ( OREC NI), Trust governance approvals, Data Access Agreements approved by all Trust Information Governance teams, Honest Broker Service approvals and Change Control Requests (to allow data extraction from TF3 datasets) . Details of these approvals are included in Appendix 1. 3.2 Study site The evaluation involved all five HSC Trusts in Northern Ireland. There was significant variability in the ways in w hich the individual Trusts implemented telehealth services , their focus on different patient groups and their different alternatives to telehealth. Strong engagement and support was received from each of the Trusts, indeed telehealth service managers withi n each Trust acted as study Principal Investigators in delivering the research programme. 3.3 General principles of the evaluation A mixed methods approach was used , in keeping with the resources and time available to conduct the research . Methods were chosen for their appropriateness to the over -arching aims of evaluating the impact of telehealth on patient self -care and healthcare resource utilisation . Reflecting the experience and research expertise of the team assembled to deliver this project, the focus was on four clinical conditions : heart failure, COPD, hypertension and diabetes ; with a more focused, s upplementary analysis also planned for stroke . Patients , associated carers and practitioners from each of these condition s were included in the evaluation. In order to account for differing levels of exposure to the telehealth service provision, in the quantitative analyses, patients were divided into five groupings as follows : (i) Never installed - patient was referred but equipment was not installed, (ii) S uccessful - patient joined service and was subsequently discharged with outcome recorded as achieved , (iii) Not successful - patient joined service, but was discharged with outcome recorded as unsuccessful, e.g. non-compliance with service , (iv) Discharged with no reason for discharge given and finally (v) O ngoing - patient joined service and continues to receive it. Further details on the criteria and definition of the five different patient groups are provided in Appendix 2 . When carry ing out the questionnaire survey work to gather information of health related quality of life and self -care, t wo cohorts of patients were included: Cohort 1 were patients referred to telehealth before 31 May 2015 , forming a group of patients for retrospective review , and Cohort 2 were referred to telehealth during the period June 2015 to September 2015 , forming a group of patients for prospective review and follow -up. For quantitative aspects of the evalua tion, anonymised routine healthcare utilis ation data or administrative data already collected by the Telemonitoring NI team were used . Available data from all patients in each cohort were used in order to maximise the power of the study and to avoid problems that might arise from having to extrapolate from samples. For the qualitative an d quantitative aspect s that require d data collection , samples were chosen relevant to the matter under investigation. An overview of the evaluation methodology is provided in Figure 2. Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 5 Figure 2 Schematic representation of complete study programme 4. Methodology This section describes the series of studies that evaluate d various aspects of the telehealth NI programme . These include the descriptive analyses of the upta ke of the service, quantitative analyses of its effects on health -related outcomes and qualitative analyses of the views of patients , patient carers and practitioners. Results collected using the mixed method s approach outlined below were used , through a p rocess of triangulation, to inform the conclusions drawn from the overall evaluation . 4.1 Descriptive summary of the uptake of the telehealth service The objective of this aspect of the research was to use routine data collected by the provider (TF3) as part of the service provision , together with datasets held in the Business Services Organisation Regional Data Warehouse to provide a descriptive summary of the services delivered from the time of initiation of the service to the present time (29 May 2015) . Patient -level data obtained from TF3 were anonymised by The Honest Broker Service (HBS) and made available to researchers in the HBS Research Safe Haven . The HBS provides a service which allows researchers to access healthcare data and external datasets within a secure and confidential environment (safe haven). In order to ensure confidentiality (prevent patient identification), the HBS ensures that identifiable data are not accessible to researchers and that final analyses must undergo adequate disclosure control before being released . Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 6 4.1.1 Data acquisition Following detailed discussions with TF3 on the data held by them and following clearance by the data guardians at the five HSC Trusts, TF3 provided the following datasets to the HBS for access by the research team: Demographic data Study ID (scrambled HCN; i.e. each person had one Study ID but may have multiple referrals - used for linkage purposes). Referral ID (unique to each referral). Deceased marker Age Gender Ethnic origin, language spoken, communication issues, mobility issues and cognitive impairment. Super Output Area (SOA - used to link address to measures of deprivation and in particular, urban/rural indicators) Telemonitoring NI data HSC Trust Treatment Team Dates: referral, installation, discharge and removal of patient equipment Condition e.g. CHF, COPD, diabetes (tablet, diet and insulin controlled), gestational diabetes and a free text box to report on any o ther con ditions, e.g. weight management . Disease package Referral priority (standard/urgent) Type of monitoring required (Triage or Track and Trend) Installed (yes/no) Reason for discharge Frequency for patient to submit readings Proposed length of monitor ing (at time of referral, maximum length set to 364 days) Education package Additionally, smoking status, weight and fluid intake restriction details were available for some of the referrals. A scrambled GP practice code and yes/no boxes indicated which vi tal signs were being monitored. The HBS also agreed to link the TF3 data with Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA ) deprivation data already held by them. This linkage was achieved through the u se of the healthcard registration number (HCN) which is a unique identifier for all patients registered to receive national healt h services in Northern Ireland. The HCN was then removed from the final dataset. 4.1.2 Data analysis The dataset used in this aspect of the research covered the period from the initiation of the service on 9 December 2011 up to 29 May 2015 (earliest and latest referral dates respectively). The dataset was used to support descriptive analyses of provision of , and engagement with , the service across the five HSC Trusts an d across all conditions for which the service was offered. The descriptive data were categori sed into quarterly (three -month ) time periods from the incepti on of the service, to allow changes over time to be assessed. 4.2 Quantitative evaluation of the telehealth programme The quantitative analysis aspects of the evalu ation focus ed on three themes : (i) how engageme nt with the programme influenced self-care and self -efficacy, (ii) the overall effectiveness o f the telehealth programme and (iii) a health economic analysis of the programme . Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 7 4.2.1 Self-care study The focus of this evaluation was on patients who received telehealth services for the management of the four targeted conditions, i.e. COPD, diabetes, hypertension and heart failure . For this element of the research two studies were planned: a retrospective study involving Cohort 1 (patients referred for telehealth services before 31 May 2015) and a prospective study involving Cohort 2 (patients referred for telehealth services during the period June 2015 to September 2015) . The questionnaires selected for both the retrospective and prospective studies were as follows: generic self -efficacy scale (Schwarzer and Jerusalem, 1995) generic quality of life questionnaire (EQ -5D-5L, Herdman et al., 2011) COPD self -efficacy scale (Wigal et al., 1991) Stanford Self -efficacy for diabetes scale (patienteducation.stanford.edu/ research/sediabetes.pdf) European Heart Failure Self -Care Behaviour scale (Jaarsma et al., 2003) Hypertension Self -Care A ctivity Level Effects (H -Scale ; Warren -Findlow et al., 2013) All participating patients , in both the retrospective and prospective studies detailed below , were asked to complete the two gene ric questionnaires and the disease specific questionnaire relevant to their condition . The health -related quality of life questionnaire (EQ -5D-5L; Herdman et al., 2011) consists of a descriptive system and a visual analogue scale. Responses from the descriptive system provide a health profile of patients and can be converted into utilities by applying scores from a UK value set. The visual analogue scale records the patients' self -rated health status. (a) Participant recruitment : Cohort 1 - retrospective study An anonymised list of eligible patients, i.e. referred within the specified time period and receiving telehealth services for COPD, diabetes, hypertension or heart failure , were prepared by the research team in the HBS . Any record that was marked as deceased was excluded . This list was de -anonymised and passed to the service provider ( Fold) by the HBS. Fold then completed a mail merge and posted information packs provided by the research team to individual patients . These package s included a letter of invitation to join the study, a participant information shee t, consent form , relevant questionnaires and a business return (postage paid) envelope. Potential participants were asked to consider taking part in the study and to return the signed consent form to the research team together with their completed questionnaires . Initially 1000 information packs were sent out to eligible patients from Cohort 1. Due to the low numbers of patients with hypertension and CHF, all eligible patients with these conditions were sent an information pack , whereas packs were sent to a stratified random sample of patients with diabetes and COPD. Staff within Fold ensured that selected patients were eligible and had been referred for the named condition by checking against t he variable \"Treatment Team \". This check was critical for conditions like diabetes wh ere the patient data may suggest that they were on the service to monitor diabetes, even though , they were actually having blood sugar monitored as part of a weight management intervention . Similarly, for hypertension (which had relatively few patients ), it was Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 8 important for staff at Fold to check the treatment team variable to make sure that the selected patient indeed had hypertension and was not having their blood pressure monitored for another reason . The first 1000 packages were sent during the first week of November 2015. This coincided with a publicity piece (written s tory and photograph with a diabetes patient who had used the telehealth service alongside some members from the research team) to help promote this element of the study . The latter was distributed to the Press and shared on social media. By 11 December 2015 a total of 98 c ompleted questionnaires were returned to the research team. In an attempt to increase the response rate, an additional 6 60 packages ( to all remaining patients with diabetes and COPD) were prepared and posted by Fold. This second mailing took place during the second week of December 2015. Following this second mailing, responses were received from a total of 120 patients . A total of 23 packages were returned to the research team indicating that the person was no longer living at the address held by Fold . During mid -January 2016 a repeat mailing was sent to all those who had not responded , together with a copy of the Press release. Additionally, Diabetes UK NI and Chest Heart and Stroke (NI) were contacted and informed about the research. They shared the Press release on their social media outlets to help raise awareness of the evaluation. Responses were accepted until 22 February 2016 and a total of 206 responses were received by that date . Patient numbers within the full cohort, broken down by Trust are included in Tabl e 1, i.e. the total of 1660 patients.

The recruitm ent strategy for identifying participants for Cohort 2 i nvolved Fold sending out information packs to all eligible patients who were newly referred to the telehealth service during June to September 2015. Preliminary data had suggested that this would equate to 60 patients per month but, in fact, referrals to the telehealth service for the four target conditions during the recruitment period were much lower (approximately 20 per month). The plan had been t o follow up these patients over a period of nine months at three month intervals (i.e. four time points; bas eline, three months, six months and nine months). In addition , patients would have been asked to keep a diary of their healthcare service usage. However, due to the small number Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 9 of recruited patients (only eight consented participants) , this element of the study was discontinued with the agreement of the sponsor in order to focus efforts on other elements of the research programme. 4.2.2 Effectiveness study Data collected in the descriptive study were used within the HBS to support this aspect of the research . Additional healthcare utilisation data, held in the HBS, were also linked to patient datasets to allow a holistic evaluation of outcomes. These latter datasets were as follows: Hospital outpatient clinic data (for each episode) -OP dataset Appointment date Reason for referral & code Procedure code Type of outpatient clinic (service description / speciality) Consultant -led or non -consultant -led Accident and Emergency data (for each episode) -Symphony & NIRAES datasets Date of attendance at A&E Reason for attendance at A&E (Diagnosis code) Diagnosis description Discharge outcome/departure method Hospital admission and discharge data including day procedures (for each episode) -A&D dataset Date of hospital admission Reason for hospital admission ( Diagnosis code) HRG4 grouping Elective or non -elective Date of discharge from hospital Place discharged to Other health and social care data (for each episode) (Enhanced Prescribing Database -EPD) Prescribing and dispensing data. The original protocol for the evaluation included a plan to use linked information on all contacts with GPs and other providers of health or social care in order to provide a full 'picture' of healthcare resource utilisation , however, this level of detailed data was not consistently ava ilable at the time of the study. These analys es were therefore not incorporated into th is report . Individual patients were matched with their routine healthcare utilisation data. Associations between the provision of telehealth services and outcomes were assessed . As mentioned in Section 3.3 , this involved comparing five groups of patients, classified as: (i) Never installed - patient was referred but equipment was not installed, (ii) Successful - patient joined service and was subsequentl y discharged with outcome recorded as achieved, (iii) Not successful - patient joined service, but was discharged with outcome recorded as unsuccessful, e.g. non -compliance with service, (iv) Discharged with no reason for discharge given and finally (v) On going - patient joined the service and continues to receive it (Appendix 2). Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 10 The date of installation or in the case of those not installed, the date of referral was used as a time point to dem arcate whether telehealth had a subsequent effect on healthcare service interactions. Healthcare utilisation data were available for the period 20 November 2009 until 21 December 2015. Data were computed for each patient within this timeframe for the period before the installation date and for the period after the installation date. If a patient died after installation, an estimated date of death was inserted as the endpoint for that individual. As actual date of death was not available , we used the last date on which a prescription was issued (taken from the Electronic Prescribing Database, EPD) as a proxy for the date of death . For those patients who were referred more than once (two or three times), the earliest date of referral was selected as the initiation period for telehealth service provision. 4.2.3 Statistical methods Analyses were performed at a significance level of 0.0 5. Data were summarised as mean and standard deviation (SD), median and inter-quartile range or numbers and proportions (%) depending on the scale of measurement. Difference in the continuous outcomes (e.g. number of admissions, length of hospital stay) between the groups was tested for significance using the independent t -test when comparing two groups (e.g. never installed versus installed) or 1 -way analysis of var iance followed by post -hoc tests for 3+ groups (e.g. never installed versus not successful, successful, ongoing). The chi -square test was used to test the differenc e in the proportions between groups for categorical v ariables (e.g. mortality). Time-to-even t data (e.g. time from installation to death) were analysed using Kaplan -Meier plots and the log-rank test. 4.3 Health economic analysis of the telehealth programme The principal aims of the economic component were as follows; 1. To analyse the non-elective healthcare service costs of patients in each of the target conditions. This was completed for before and after referral to the service and for all five patient types. 2. To estimate the cost of providing the telehealth service per patient overal l and per patient within each of the target conditions. 4.3.1 Costing non-elective healthcare service usage The patient -level non -elective healthcare service use collected in the effectiveness study (see previous section) was c ombined with unit costs (Table 2) to estimate a cost for each patient. This was costed before and after referral to the service and for the five different patient groups. Unit costs were based on the 2013/2014 financial returns of the health and social tru sts in Northern Ireland which were obtained from the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety. Due to the lack of reliable Health Resource Group (HRG) coding in the linked data obtained from the HBS we could not assign specific unit costs to each non -elective stay. Instead we based the unit costs on the weighted averages of the costs for each type of stay. For long stays of more than six days (weighted average length of stay of all non -elective long -stays), we attached an excess bed day cost for every day over. The unit costs for outpatient attendances and accident and emergency visits were similarly based on weighted Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 11 averages. We bore in mind the patient demographic and did not included paediatric and pregnancy related HRGs in our calculation s of weighted averages. Table 2 Unit costs (\u00a3) of non -elective hospital services. Service Unit costs (\u00a3) Non-elective inpatient stay (short stay) 584 Non-elective inpatient stay (long stay) 2959 Non-elective excess bed day (long stay) 420 Outpatient attendance 154 Accident and Emergency 139 Source: Trust Financial Returns (TFR H), 2013/14. 4.3.2 Costing the telehealth service We used the TF3 dataset which included all patients who were referred to the service from 09 December 2011 until 29 May 2015 to estimate the cost of providing the service up until a cut -off date of the end of July 2015. Information on the some of the costs associated with the de livering the telehealth service was provided by the Centre for Connected Health and Social Care (CCHSC). Four key cost components were identified; 1. Installation charge 2. De-installation (removal) charge 3. Daily disease package charge 4. Standing charge. The fixed price to install the telehealth equipment in a patient's home was \u00a332 and the fixed price to de - install was also \u00a332. The daily disease package charge reflected the costs associated with maintaining the equipment and was dependent upon the disease package the patient was receiving as presented in (Appendix 7: Table 7.16). For each patient refe rred to the service during the specified timeframe we calculated the cost to provide them with the telehealth service using the following formula (where y is the daily charge for the appropriate disease package as specified in Appendix 7: Table 7.16); Installation charge (\u00a332) + De-installation charge (if applicable = \u00a332) + Daily standing charge (\u00a32.28 x days on service) + Disease package daily charge (\u00a3y x days on service) = Total cost for each referral (\u00a3) We also calculated costs on an annual basis to provide a one year snapshot of the service. We costed for the whole service as well as for the four target conditions only. 4.4 Qualitative analyses of patient and health professional views of the telehealth programme The objectives of this aspect of the evaluation were twofold: (a) To conduct focus group discussions with telehealth service users to obtain their views and experiences of the service. While the emphasis was on the four target conditions (COPD, heart failure, hypertension and diabetes), interviews with a number of stroke Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 12 patients, carers and patients who were offered telehealth and declined, or who were discharged unsuccessfully, were also carried . (b) To conduct interviews with a range of healthcare professionals who are directly involved in telehealth provision (or who have the potential to be involved in the future) to gather information on their views on this new approach to community based care. 4.4.1 Patient views on t he telehealth programme The primary approach to collecting data on the views of patients about the telehealth service was via focus groups. Five focus groups incorporating the four target conditions (distributed across the five Trusts) were held. Telehealth Service Managers (TSMs) in each Trust were asked to identify patients (with COPD, heart failure, diabetes or hypertension) who would be able to travel to and take part in a focus group discussion. A study information sheet, invitation letter, co nsent form and stamped addressed envel ope were posted to TSMs who distributed these to potential participants. If an insufficient response was received the groups were supplemented by patients from the Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 subgroups (Section 4.2.1 ) who had expressed an interest in taking part in focus group discussions when they returned their questionnaires . TSMs were asked to select participants with a range of the conditions being studied, and some with multi -morbidity, in order to get a good represent ation of patients who have received the service. Having recruited patients and having obtained their written informed consent to participate, focus groups were convened at a time and place convenient to participants (for example, a meeting room at a Trust hospital site). Trust TSMs assisted in finding a suitable venue. A topic guide directed d iscussion at the focus groups. T opics included perceived value of telehealth monitoring in self -care, educational aspects of the service, engagement with the service and healthcare providers, confidence in using equipment, user-friendliness of equipment, confidence placed on readings taken, interactions with healthcare professionals during their period of equipment use, and perceived value of participation in the progr amme (e.g. peace of mind through self -monitoring). Participants were encouraged to introduce other topics of interest and importance. All focus group discussions were audio recorded and participants were assured that all comments made were non -attributable (kept confidential) and that their names would not appear on any study reports. Focus group methodology was selected in order to stimulate open conversation, allowing for the expression of ideas and common experiences which might not have been expressed i n a one -to-one interview situation. It is also a more cost -effective and efficient means of assessing the views of a large number of individuals than one -to-one interviews (Hughes and McCann, 2003). To supplement the focus group discussions, three additi onal groups of participant were recruited: Home visits were made to patients with stroke who had used the service. These patients were interviewed together with their carers (as appropriate). The same range of questions as addressed in the focus groups wer e used, and all recordings were transcribed in full for qualitative analysis. Secondly, views of patients who were offered the service and declined, or who were discharged early due to engagement issues were gathered. Patients who fitted into this category were identified Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 13 using the Telemonitoring dataset accessible via the HBS. Patient health and social care numbers were passed confidentially to Fold, who posted invitations supplied by the research team . The topic guide for these interviews included questio ns similar to those used for the focus groups but with additional questions designed to ascertain reasons for declining the service or being discharged early. Thirdly, carers of patients were interviewed to gain insight into t heir experiences of telehealth , with recruitment again being facilitated by the telehealth key workers. All interviews were transcribed verbatim and two researchers conducted independent analyses of the transcripts in order to find emerging themes. A constant comparative method was use d and agreement was reached between the researchers on the discovered themes. 4.4.2 Healthcare professional views on the telehealth programme A sample of healthcare professionals, from different professional groups who were involved in the delivery of the telehealth service (triage nurses, service development managers in Trusts, telehealth NI key workers (i. e., specialist community nurses) or wh o had the potential to be involved in the future (general practitioners, community pharmacists, hospital doctors) were recruited to take part in telephone interviews. As with recruitment of patients to focus groups, the research team sought the help of TSM s with this task. Snowball sampling was also employed in order to optimise the number of participants available for interview. Telephone i nterviews covered a similar range of topics to those in the focus group discussions with patients and were continued until data saturation was reached for each healthcare professional grouping. If healthcare professionals were not currently involved in telehealth delivery they were asked from the perspective of their potential engagement with the service. All interviews were recorded and transcribed for analysis. A similar analytical approach was employed to that used for the patient focus groups . 5. Results The results of the different aspects of the evaluation are presented in the same sequence as used in the methodo logy section, as follows: 5.1 Descriptive summary of the uptake of the telehealth service 5.2 Quantitative evaluation of the telehealth programme 5.2.1 Self -care study 5.2.2 Effectiveness study 5.3 Health economic analysis of the telehealth programme 5.4 Qualitative analysis of patient and healthcare professional views of the telehealth programme 5.4.1 Patients views on the telehealth programme : focus groups 5.4.2 Patients views on the programme: carers 5.4.3 of telehealth progr amme: discharged unsuccessfully 5.4.4 Healthcare professional views of the telehealth programme Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 14 5.1 Descriptive summary of the uptake of the telehealth service This s ection provides a descriptive overview of all those referred to the telehealth service , for all conditions (i.e. not restricted to the four conditions that form the focus of other aspects of this evaluation). Data are reported at the level of individual patients as far as possible, but where appropriate , data are pres ented on a referral basis (bearing in mind that some patients were referred more than once) . There were a total of 4216 referrals to the service over the time period covered by the evaluation which equates to 39 44 individual patients (Table 3). Of those wh o were referred to the service, 695 people (17.6%) were recorded as deceased. Exemplars of the main findings are included within the body of this report while several supporting or supplementary tables are included in Appendix 4. 5.1.1 Timeframes and pati ent numbers Table 3 General characteristics of total dataset (timeframes and referral numbers) Procedure Earliest Latest Notes Referral s 09 Dec 2011 29 May 2015 All 4216 have a referral date. 408 referrals were not installed.

Ethnicity: Most patients were Caucasian (3859), 56 have no ethnicity stated and 29 come from other ethnic backgrounds , which include: Asian (Chinese, Indian, Philippine, Other); Black (African, Caribbean); Travelling community; Mixed (Asian/ Black: African/ Caucasian), Portuguese and Romanian. Language: Most patients (3922) had English as their first language , with only 22 rep orted to speak other languages, which include : Chinese, Czech, Latvian, Hindi, Lithuanian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovakian, Somalian and Tetum. Communication issues: Most referrals (4055) were reported to have no communication issues. The remaining 161 referrals had some form of communication problem, described within the following areas: understanding of equipment; hearing, visual or speech impairment; uses lip reading, interpreter, Braille or sign language; becomes anxious; becomes breathless; needs assistance (family member will communicate with telehealth team); dementia, stroke, Parkinson's and Down's syndrome; English is not their first language. Cognitive impairments: Most patients (3861) using the t elehealth service were reported not to have any cognitive impairment. However, 61 were classified as having a mild cognitive impairment and 22 as having a moderate or severe cognitive impairment. Physical impairments: Most patients (3044) did not have a recorded physical impairment. However, 610 were mobile with aids (including wheelchair users), 203 were reported to be mobile at home only and 45 were recorded as having no mobility . The remaining 42 had some other mobility issue reco rded, for instance, back/knee/feet problems, prosthetic leg, paralysis of one side of body, uses ambulatory oxygen, osteomyelitis (foot), slow movement, bed bound and visual impairment which restricts m obility. 5.1.3 Referral and service provision Referrin g Trusts: Referral numbers by Trust (from highest to lowest) are ordered as follows: Most patients (3691 ) were referred once only, 235 were referred twice (470 referrals) and 18 were referred three times (54 referrals) . Conditions referred for, including co -morbidities: Patients were predominantly referred for the following single conditions, i.e. COPD, diabetes, weight management, stro ke, heart failure and kidney problems. Other conditions included co -morbidities, such as diabetes with weight management, CHF with COPD, COPD with other comorbidities and hypertension only (Figure 3) . Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 16 Figure 3 Conditions for which patients were referred to the telehealth service Disease packages: The most common disease packages that patients were supplied with included : diabetes home based (1395) , COPD (976), diabetes mobile ( 562), stroke (371), heart failu re (325) and COPD with BP (290). It should be noted that many patients who were supplied with a diabetes package were receiving this for weight management. Education packages: Most patients (3826) using the telehealth service were reported as not having been given any education package. Some examples of education packages which were recorded as delivered were in relation to diet, exercise, weight management, management of COPD, management of diabetes, management of heart failure , secondary prevention o f strok e and inhaler technique . Referral priority: Most referrals (3815 or 90.5%) were classified as 'standard' referrals, with 401 (9.5%) classified as 'urgent' referrals. There were 408 referrals that were not installed. Proposed and actual length of monitorin g: The 'proposed length of monitoring' is set at the time of referral with the maximum length restricted to 364 days. Many referrals were renewed , which accounts for the longer upper limit within duration of monitoring in the variab le 'actual length of mon itoring '. The 'proposed length of monitoring' variable ranged from 7 to 364 days (median 182 days) while the actual length of monitoring ranged from 0 to 1387 days (median 161.5 days). 1030 referrals had no 'actual length of monitoring' recorded, since this sample included patients who were still on the service and have not yet been discharged. Quarterly uptake of service: There was a slightly higher number of installations during the second quarter after initiation of the service (January to March 20 12, 426 installations ), than in any other quarter (see Appendix 4 : Tables 4.7 -4.9 for more detail) . Frequency of patient submission of data: Most referrals (1819) involved patients submit ting data on a weekly basis ; 1092 were recorded as submit ting data daily, with 927 on weekdays only and the remaining 378 submit ting data at another frequency (including weekends; Appendix 4 : Table 4.10) . Hypertension Gestational diabetes with COPD COPD with other Diabetes with wt mgmt Other Kidney problems Heart failure Stroke Weight management Diabetes COPDStudy title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 17 Patient types: For the purposes of t he quantitative study (Section 4 .2), patients were categorised into patient type s. The composition of the full dataset of 3944 people were as follows: non -target condition (1549), ongoing (736), discharged - successful (571), mixed or other (436), discharged with reason for discharge unknown (289), discharged - not successful (249) an d never installed (114). Type of monitoring required: 1671 referrals were for the triage service and 2545 for the track and trend service. The majority of those with diabetes and hypertension were referred for track and trend monitoring, whereas the majori ty of COPD and heart failure patients were referred for the triage service (Table 5) . Table 5 Type of monitoring required for the four main target conditions Cond ition Track and trend (total referrals) Triage (total referrals) COPD 19 904 Diabetes 754 26 Heart failure 11 273 Hypertension 39 4 5.1.4 Patient deprivation and proximity to services The 2011 Super Output Areas ( SOAs ) were used to examine the distribution of the addresses of telehealth service users in accordance with deprivation indices . In particular the Multiple Deprivation Measure (MDM) and the proximity to services subscale within this latter measure were referenced. A total of 4171 out of the 4216 referrals had a n address associated with them. If an even dist ribution was present , there should be equal distribution across all ten deciles on each of the scales. The results obtained (Figure 4) indicate that there was an under -representati on of patients from the least deprived deciles for both scales (MDM and pro ximity to services subscale).

Exemplars of the findings are presented below, with further detail presented in Appendix 4: Tables 4.20 -4.24. The Y -axis in all graphs presented below is number of individual patients . Age group by Trust Figure 5 Age groups of patients to the telehealth service by Trust Figure 5 highlights the differing levels of patient participation across the different HSC Trusts. A notable outlier is referrals of patients in the age category 0 -19 years by the NHSCT . This is due to their significant adoption of the service for weight management for younger patients (often a service which is given to a whole of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 19 Conditions by age group Figure 6 Conditions of patients who were managed via the telehealth service by age group Conditions which appear in the younger age groups largely involve weight management and diabetes. All the gestational diabetes referrals were in the age group of 20 -49 years . Conditions including COPD, heart failure and stroke appear more frequently in the older age groups, in keeping with general population statistics.

NHSCT had the highest number of referrals for weight management. SEHSCT and WHSCT ha d high referrals for COPD and diabetes. SHSCT and NHSCT ha d higher referrals for heart failure and hypertension , respectively . Conditions by gender Figure 8 Conditions for which patients were monitored via the telehealth service by gender Overall , as noted above more females than males were referred to the service. This was particularly the case for weight management. However, there were some conditions for which more males were referred, i.e. stroke, heart failure and kidney problems. Age group by gender The excess of female referrals com pared to males is in large part due to their much higher referral in the younger age groups , which is associated with the monitoring of conditions such as weight management and gestational diabetes. Figure 9 Distribution of patient age group s by gende r Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 21 5.2 Quantitative evaluation of the telehealth programme As detailed within the methodology section, the quantitative evaluation of the telehealth programme involved two distinctive studies, the self -care study (retrospective su rvey of pati ents receiving services for one of the four target conditions) and an effectiveness study in which data for all patients who received the telehealth service for the targeted conditions were linked with healthcare utilisation data within the HBS . The results obtained using these two separate approaches are presented in this section. 5.2.1 Self-care study A total of 206 patients who received telehealth services for the targeted conditions completed the study questionnaires. The number of participa nts by disease category (Table 6) were as follows: 94 (46%) COPD ; 67 (33%) diabetes mellitus; heart failure (HF), and 13 (6%) hypertension (HTN). Further details are included in Appendix 5.

The mean scores are presented in Table 7. In general, patients with COPD and HF reported lower scores (poorer health -related quality of life and self -efficacy) compared to patients with DM and HTN.

Literature values for other study populations are presented in Appendix 5 A further breakdown of the summary data presente d in Table 6 for the EQ -5D-5L was performed to allow consideration of the problems being encountered by the different patient groups. These data, broken down by dim ension, are presente d in Table 8. Approximately of 50% of all COPD and HF patients reported moderate or severe problems on each dimension.

The questionnaires used were as follows: the COPD self -efficacy scale, the Stanford s elf-efficacy for diabetes scale, t he European Heart Failure self -care behavior scale and the Hypertension self -care activity level effects questionnaire (H -scale). Data obtained for COPD, DM, and HF patients are presented in Table 9 while data obtained for the H -scale are presented in Tab le 10.

The H -scale measures level of adherence with a range of sel f-care activities in patients with hypertension. The frequency of adherence reported by the participating hypertensive patients (n-13) is presented in Table 10. Most p atients reported adherence to medication usage (12 out of 13), not smoking (11 out of 13) and alcohol intake advice (10 out of 13). Only two patients reported adherence to a low salt diet (2 out of 13) and weight management recommendations (2 out of 13) while 4 patients reported adhering to recommended physical activity (4 out of 13) .

A range of the summary findings (all presented as a nnualised data) are presented in the main body of the text, with additional supporting data summarised in Appendix 6. If a patient had mixed conditions highlighted on their referral form, e.g. heart failure and COPD, these were included in each of the con dition categories for this aspect of reporting This involves 54 patients out of a total of 1959 ( i.e. 2.7% of overall population). The total population was divided into groupings as described in Section 3.3, i.e. (i) Never installed - patient was referred but equipment was not installed, (ii) Successful - patient joined service and was subsequently discharged with outcome recorded as achieved, (iii) Not successful - patient joined service, but was discharged with outcome recorded as unsuccessful, e.g. non -compliance with service, (iv) Discharged with no reason for discharge given and finally (v) Ongoing - patient joined the service and continues to receive it; and by target condition as outlined in Table 12. The telehealth referral date and date of telehealt h installatio n were used as index dates for 'Never installed' and 'Installed' groups respectively. A new group (vi) was added for comparative purposes. This comprised those patients who had used telehealth at some stage during the period, i.e. the sum of ( ii), (iii), (iv) and (v), with the numbers of patients in volved also included in Table 1 2. These subdivisions allowed various scenarios t o be compared statistically before and after patient s are first introduced to the service. If a patient had multiple s essions of telehealth service provision, the date of the first installation was used as the cut point . The hypertension group had very low numbers in total , with a number of the sub -groupings having fewer than ten patients which makes their mean estimates unreliable. In the absence of a randomised control group, or some other prospectively Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 25 collected comparable group, the never installed group acted as a quasi -control group i n all datasets. In some of the analyses , the succe ssful and ongoing groups were combined since these patients were the most likely to exhibit a positive impact of the telehealth provision.

There was a marked difference in mortality rates between the 'N ever installed ' group and patients who had telehealth services put in place (33.3% versus 13.9%; Figure 10). A Kaplan -Meier plot (Figure 11) indicated that mortali ty was particularly marked in the not install ed group in the first year after the referral date. This means that the mortality results need to be interpreted with caution when the 'Never installed ' group is used as the quasi -control group since some deaths occur red so soon after the referral date and are unlikely to have been prevented by the installation and use of the telehealth equipment. When considered by condition (Figure 12), mortality was the highest for COPD and heart failure . There were no deaths in the first two years in the hypertension group .

The mean number (SD) of non -elective admissions to hospital for the total patient cohort increased slightly in overall terms from 0.8 (1.0) and 0.7 (1.0) admissions/year to 1.2 (2.2) and 1.1 (2.2) admissions/year af ter the index dates in the 'Never installed' and 'Installed' groups respectively .

Please note that all p -values referred to in this and Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 28 the following sections relate to the change ((before minus after) in the never installed group versus the change (before minus after) in the installed group . Patients with HF showed a n anomalous decrease in the mean number of admissions from 1.3 (1.5) to 0.6 (0.9) admission s/year in the 'Neve r installed' group and an increase in the average number of admissions from 0.9 (1.0) to 1. 2 (1.6) admissions/year in the 'Installed' group (p<0.05). Data for patients with COPD and DM show no statistically significant difference between the never installe d and installed groups, albeit with a n increased hospitalisation rate over time in both the installed and never installed groups. The hypertension group showed the opposite trend, indicative of a positive impact of telehealth provision on reducing hospital admissions , but as noted above , the number of patients in this group is low and the results were not statistically significant. * indicates significant difference (p< 0.05) between groups.

Results for th e same group comparisons as were carried out for hospital utilisation are presented in Figures 2 5, 26 and 2 7. Not surprisingly the results mirror the findings for average length of stay (Figures 1 6, 17 and 1 8) because hospital 'hotel' charges dominate overall costs of healthcare delivery. The mean cost per year for the patient groupings was highest for patients with COPD and heart failure and lower for patients with diabetes and hypertension. In general the results were not statistically significant (p>0.05) although the anomalous heart failure results (decreased hospital utilisation after introduction of telehealth in the 'N ever installed ' group) led to a small number of statistically significant findi ngs HTN TotalVisits/year Health conditionAverage number of outpatient visits Never installed before Never installed after Not successful before Not successful Successful before Successful after Discharged before Discharged after Ongoing before Ongoing after* *Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 40 22 and 23).

Each group of participants (focus groups, and interviews with carers, health professionals, stroke patien ts and patients discharged/declined) was analysed separately. To ensure minimisation of researcher bias during theme development, two researchers independently coded the transcripts and developed themes using the constant comparative method. Codes were re corded using NVivo. Themes were discussed with the wider research team to help further refine the analyses and a thematic framework was developed in line with the approach and aims of this study. 5.4.1 Patient views of telehealth programme: focus groups One focus group was held in each of the five Trusts in Northern Ireland. Focus groups, incorporating patients and their carers, ranged in size from three participants to seven. A total of 24 patients agreed to take part and 15 attended. Reasons for non -attendance were illness, other appointments and one person had died. Participants had a range of conditions, namely COPD (n=8), diabetes (n=6) and heart disease (n=1). The focus groups in each Trust had the following numbers of participants: Belfast - 3 pati ents and 1 carer, average patient age 72.3 years; Northern - 3 patients and 2 carers, average patient age 67.6 years; South Eastern - two patients and 1 carer, average patient age 51.0 years; Southern - 3 patients and 1 carer, average age 66.0 years; Weste rn 4 patients and three carers, average patient age 73.3 years. Analysis of views Patients were unanimously positive about telemonitoring, with the main benefit being the reassurance it gave them that a health professional was monitoring them constantly. S ome patients, particularly those with COPD, reported real clinical benefits because telemonitoring acted as an early warning system - early indications of infection were picked up by triage nurses because readings were observed daily, allowing treatment to be started quickly. Patients said that there was no doubt that this had saved them hospital stays - and staying out of hospital was a major benefit. Analysis of the data led to the themes outlined below. Participants are coded with the annotation FG# (foc us group number 1 to 5 according to Trust - we do not identify Trust here for confidentiality reasons), M/F (gender), participant number in group, condition (C=COPD, D=diabetes, H=heart disease). A number of spouses, other family members and carers of part icipants were present; they are coded accordingly. Impact on health and healthcare utilisation Many patients said that telemonitoring had made a significant impact on their health and hospital stays. This COPD patient attributed telemonitoring to keeping h im out of hospital 'on several occasions' during the previous two years: Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 43 \"Over the last two years it has worked very well for me and I've only been in hospital once over that period of time, so I would be a big fan of it (telemonitoring). At least I can lead somewhat of a normal life. Before, I could guarantee that by the eighth week I was back in hospital again, and I was usually in for a six to eight week stay.\" (FG3, M1, C) These sentiments were echoed by another COPD patient's carer: \"That (readings going through to triage nurses) will tell you if you're high, low or in between and that will save you running into a crisis.\" (FG2, F1 husband, C) Overall, patients said that their contact with health professionals had been less often since having telemo nitoring, and that they welcomed that. \"I would say so (had fewer visits to GP). I would have probably gone in a bit more often (before telemonitoring) as I was concerned about the pains I was having. I would say like I was being watched and it was all rig ht then or they would come back to me.\" (FG5, M3, H) Contact with professionals connected with telemonitoring, including specialist nurses and triage nurses, was unanimously praised. \"They are always good ... they are good at looking after you.\" (FG5, M1, C) Encouragement from health professionals helped develop confidence for patients: \"I said to my chemist 'you know, my oxygen levels are always good' and she said 'it's because you take your medication properly' so that was a benefit to me, that I'm doing something right, you know, it really does make me feel safe, it really does.\" (FG1, F2, C) Patients also derived satisfaction from their belief that they were visiting their healthcare professional less often: \"I'm sure it's also a comfort to the doctors because at least that's less visits.\" (FG3, F1 relative, C) Incentive for use For diabetes patients using the track and trend service, it was reported that telemonitoring acted as an incentive to maintain a healthy diet because of the knowledge that some one else - not just themselves - was monitoring blood sugar levels. \"I think you're supposed to use it for six months but because my blood sugars were coming down so well and it encouraged me to make sure I ate properly, I asked if I could stay on it longe r and they said yes, and I was on it for about a year.\" (FG4, F1, D) The same patient said that after coming off telemonitoring, she no longer adhered to her healthy diet: \"It was easier when I was on it because I wasn't tempted to eat biscuits or sweets or crisps ... and you know my blood sugars did come down ... but I've gone sideways again and they're talking about actually putting me on to it again.\" The biggest incentive, she said, was that if professionals were making time and effort to help her, she needed to do the same: Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 44 \"It was very valuable for me because definitely it made me think 'you don't need that piece of chocolate, you don't need it', so it definitely made me think twice before I would put anything that I shouldn't have into my mouth. Because I knew I was being monitored ... they were trying to help me so I had to try and help myself.\" Another diabetes patient said that although he was strict with his diet anyway, he found satisfaction in aiming for good readings: \"I found just to see the resul ts coming up it annoyed me if they were high and it made you feel good if they weren't high.\" (FG4, M1, D) \"It's like a policeman in the house keeping an eye on you ... there's nowhere to hide from it if you don't put your readings in.\" (FG2, M1, D) For a COPD patient, the incentive from telemonitoring was to address issues early rather than precipitating a serious exacerbation : \"This (telemonitoring) is ideal for me because it means somebody's there to say 'no, stop, address this now' rather than what I wo uld have been doing which was ploughing on and keeping on the go.\" (FG1, F1, C) She was adamant that this had resulted in fewer hospital admissions. Reassurance and support Peace of mind was a major theme with participants stating that this was perhaps t he biggest advantage of telemonitoring. The words 'reassurance', 'safety net' and comfort zone' were expressed repeatedly. \"It's peace of mind. After my (heart) surgery I had pains and aches and I often wondered am I having another heart attack? If you are on the monitoring you knew it was being watched, your heart rate and all was being watched and you had peace of mind.\" (FG5, M3, H) \"It's like a security blanket.\" (FG2, F1, C) One patient acknowledged that while telemonitoring had not helped to improve his actual condition, COPD, which he understands is terminal, but it has given peace of mind: \"It gave me contentment ... if I went to bed with a bit of wheezes ... the next day I would go on the telemonitoring and if the reading was 95 well I'm ok.\" (FG5, M1 , C) Further, his wife also found reassurance: \"It gave me peace of mind to have it in the house.\" (FG5, M1 wife, C) Patients derived reassurance not only from knowing that their symptoms were stable and that a professional was keeping a constant eye on them, but also through believing that they were less of a burden on the health service. Having the tools to hand in their own home meant they could easily take readings at any time: \"My heart ... was speeding this morning. But when I did it (measured heart r ate) an hour later it had settled down ... I would have been the first to be down in the doctors' and see what is going on, but it could settle down and it's a total embarrassment.\" (FG3, M1, C) Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 45 Family members also experienced great reassurance from knowing that their loved one was being monitored regularly: \"It takes the pressure off, you know, knowing that if he needed someone they are on the phone, because I can't get up now (to his house) as often as I did.\" (FG3, M2 relative, D) \"My wife ... it gives her reassurance; even the kids, it gives them reassurance. To me it's a great safety net.\" (FG3, M1, C) \"They (family) were all glad that I was doing it and they were glad that I was being more careful with myself for my own sake.\" (FG4, F1, D) This patient 's husband agreed, saying that the constant monitoring was key: \"With your six -monthly check -ups when you go to see the consultant, if you do misbehave and eat the sweet stuff, you know you've got maybe four or five months to catch up and be good. Whereas with the machine, you know, it's instant, and it's the big brother aspect and it's very, very beneficial.\" (FG4, F1 husband, D) This reassurance was reinforced through the support received from triage nurses. Patients were impressed at how quickly they we re contacted if there was a query, and about the genuine care which was shown towards them. This added to the feeling of reassurance and security for patients. \"The nurses will ring back and say 'You're not too good today. Do you want me to ring your docto r or do you want to go to out of hours? Have you got the number?' You know, they are always very friendly and very supportive. And they ring you back, you know, within about half an hour of the readings.\" (FG3, F1 relative, C) \"It (telemonitoring service) was perfect in every way and they were very courteous.\" (FG4, F1, D) \"They have told me that if I need them (nurses) they will come out, I mean, how secure can you feel after that?\" (FG1, F2, C) \"What I love about it is I mean when I do all my checks ev ery morning ... if my blood pressure was down, they were on the ball and they always ring me is something is not right. I wouldn't be without it, they're all lovely (triage nurses), I've never met them but I recognise their voices, lovely team you know.\" (FG 2, F2, C) Empowerment and education Patients spoke of learning more about their own condition and becoming confident in this increasing knowledge of what their normal readings should be. \"I knew what my blood pressure should be.\" (FG5, M3, H) \"You feel in control, not somebody else. You feel in control of your own health and what's going on. It gives you a certain amount of independence, and responsibility that you're not relying on somebody else all the time.\" (FG3, M1, C) A COPD patient argued that he had become proficient at taking his measurements but he still relied on the professional to make judgements about his condition: Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 46 \"I can read my SPO2 from my finger and I can take my blood pressure, I can weigh myself and take my temperature, but that's th e mechanical part of it, that's using the machinery if you like, but it doesn't tell me a lot personally, maybe it tells whoever's monitoring it at the other end.\" (FG1, M1, C) The carer of a COPD patient said it was enough to be aware that action needed to be taken when readings were at a certain level: \"In our particular case, we're not experts in what's wrong with us but it's an understanding of what happens if and what happens if not, and you can take appropriate action.\" (FG2, F1 husband, C) Routine and convenience Routine and convenience were cited as benefits of telemonitoring. Participants reported that taking their readings at set times during the week became part of their routine and was not disruptive. \"It had minimal effect on me. It was just a wee routine you go through, like having your breakfast every morning or brushing your teeth. It takes literally two minutes.\" (FG5, M2, D). \"It only takes a few minutes, it doesn't inconvenience me in any way and I couldn't say it has made any difference to my way of life.\" (FG1, M1, C) However an alteration to that routine meant that some forward planning is required: \"I've got into a routine now so I'm happy to stick with the same time every day. I get up at seven o'clock on a routine day but it's awkw ard when you're on business trips and you're away. It knocks the whole thing off. I just simply phone and say 'I won't be monitoring for the next couple of days'. It just takes the whole strain and stress off that.\" (FG5, M2, D) Patients said that they ha d found telemonitoring to be extremely convenient because of how simple it was to use: \"I put it (readings) into the wee machine and it goes off (to the triage nurses). I don't used to have to write it all down in books. So it saves a lot of work, for me a nd the nurse.\" (FG3, M2, D) \"I just thought it was great. It saves you any bother having to run in (to the clinic) to see her (the specialist nurse), she could check (readings via telemonitoring).\" (FG2, M1, D) \"It saves you going down to (hospital) ... that saves you a lot of time, it saves her (wife) a lot of time and it saves the health service a lot of time.\" (FG2, F1 husband, C) Resources Patients were unanimously positive about the equipment. Participants stressed that it was a major benefit that the equipment was easy to use because they were dealing with a chronic illness - they did not desire anything more complicated which they believed might have caused stress. \"Sometimes it had the odd wee technical issue but not very often. Generally speakin g it's a minor inconvenience.\" (FG5, M2, D) \"I'm happy enough with the system as it is.\" (FG3, M1, C) Some patients with diabetes used the monitor to submit seven days' worth of readings once a week: \"The voice would come on (from the machine) 'please do your update' so you just put your readings into the machine and then it went right through to them.\" (FG4, F1, D) Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 47 \"I had no problems with it at all. You came in from work and five minutes later it was done.\" (FG4, M1, D) One patient mentioned that if th e machine was set to ask for readings to be submitted at a certain time, it could occasionally disturb a peaceful morning: \"Waking me up in the morning when I'm trying to have a good sleep. Sometimes you love a lie in and then when you get the voice boomin g 'time for your ...' I'm saying 'go away'.\" (FG2, F1, C) Dependence and continuation Many patients using telemonitoring expressed strong support for the continuation of the service : \"That's my bone of contention. I'm losing it in March. I really don't und erstand the health board's idea of financial management. Surely it's cheaper to keep that in your home than to keep you in hospital.\" (FG3, M1, C) This patient said he would go as far as buying his own monitor if it was taken away: \"The hospital is the last resort, it really is. In my case I would have to think about going down the line of buying one. It has to be cheaper to keep that in my home than to keep me in hospital.\" Others also dreaded the thought of losing telemonitoring: \"As long as I don't l ose it, it doesn't bother me. I don't want to lose the monitor.\" (FG3, F2, D) \"I really, really would find it very difficult to cope without it.\" (FG2, F1 husband, C) Many patients were in favour of continuing the service. \"I think the final analysis is just keep it.\" (FG3, M2 relative, D) \"Just don't take it off us.\" (FG3, F2, D) \"I think it's going well and it it's not broke don't fix it.\" (FG3, M1, C) \"I think if you find anybody that's against it there's something wrong with them.\" (FG2, M1, D) 5.4.2 Patient views of telehealth programme: carers Six carers of patients who used telemonitoring were interviewed. They were spouses, children or friends of the patients. Five patients were being monitored for COPD and one for diabetes; five of the six patients had multi -morbidities. Analyses revealed the similar themes emerging from the data as those from the patient interviews, ie, impact on health and healthcare utilisation, reassurance and support, convenience, and improved education and self -care. However, some themes emerged which were unique to carers which are highlighted below. Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 48 Impact on healthcare and utilisation Carers recognised that telemonitoring was convenient not only for themselves but also for healthcare professionals: \"As far as the respiratory nurses and that are concerned, it saves them the journey to have to come out and do my dad's stats when they are being done through the monitor.\" (Carer 2) This carer added that when the telemonitoring machine showed that her father's ox ygen levels had depleted too far, treatment could be started at an earlier stage than if they did not have telemonitoring: \"When it (oxygen level) drops it normally drops under ninety and we would be able to ring the doctor and the doctor would normally c ome out and give him a quick check and realise that he has some sort of an infection and get steroids on the go and get antibiotics on the go to try and get it cleared up. Where previously it probably would have gone slightly further than that to the point where he would have had to go into hospital.\" (Carer 2) Reassurance and support Reassurance that their patient (who was also a close relative) was being monitored was highlighted as a significant benefit of telemonitoring for five of the six carers inte rviewed. \"It's like having your own personal nurse, because if something is not right they will come back to you ... if they're not happy they will send somebody out to him.\" (Carer 5) \"You're catching it on much quicker than if he was just sitting there and I would see him having difficulty breathing ... it maybe stops him from having to be taken into hospital.\" (Carer 4) \"They (the nurse and doctor) see (husband) every six months and we have a wee chat and they tell us whether we are doing it right or we are not doing it right, and that I find very comforting, and if I'm worried about anything I can just ring (nurse) and she'll sort me out.\" (Carer 1) Peace of mind for a carer was an enormous benefit because they could proceed with daily tasks with less anxiety: \"It gives you that peace of mind, I know when he's going to bed that maybe things are ok, or when he gets up in the morning I could maybe nip out to the shop.\" (Carer 4) Carers added that they could take readings at any time of the day or were reassured by regular daily monitoring, all of which added to feelings of reassurance: \"I can do, you can do it at any time if you feel, if I maybe thought as the day went on or something that his breathing was a bi t laboured I can put it on and see what the oxygen levels are so it's a good help that way as well, you're not just limited to one occasion in the day.\" (Carer 4) \"It's just very useful and it puts my mind at ease having it here knowing that if he's being checked out every day and ... it puts my mind at ease.\" (Carer 5) Only one c arer expressed negative views on telemonitoring, which were focused on the system not being tailored specifically enough for the patient. He believed that this caused some time to be wasted answering irrele vant questions. Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 49 \"To me the questions, some of them are stupid or irrelevant, asking 'have you used your oxygen more than normal?' ... she uses it 24 hours a day ... we wouldn't increase the amount of oxygen she takes because we're no t allowed to.\" (Carer 6) This carer also did not understand some of the advice he was given from triage nurses: \"When we take a reading, if it reads 84 then they will ring us and say 'your oxygen levels are low, do you feel ok?', she will say 'yes I'm feeling ok', they'll say 'put the oxygen thing back on and give us another reading, if you take a couple of deep breaths that'll bring the oxygen levels up'. What is the point in that? It defeats the purpose, they shouldn't, in my opinion, be saying that ... that one sticking point with me is them telling her how to beat the system instead of playing along with it.\" (Carer 6) Empowerment and education Carers spoke of handling the telemonitoring equipment and learning about their patient's condition, indicati ng that this resulted in a sense of empowerment. \"I help him out because he would get a wee bit dizzy when he would stand on the scales and things like that and I mean I operate the machine so that he doesn't have much to do.\" (Carer 5) \"It has certainly helped me to understand what sort of levels of oxygen you would want to be looking out for as danger.\" (Carer 2) \"I sort of know then, if I take his readings myself obviously, if I would see that maybe he needs a nebuliser he could take it sooner rather t han waiting. Just different things you can pick up with the fact that you know that things aren't too good.\" (Carer 4) Routine and convenience Carers appreciated the simplicity of the telemonitoring equipment because it did not add any inconvenience or a dditional stress to their already busy lives. \"(The equipment is) very simple, amazingly simple. This is the tele -monitoring thing (carer demonstrates how she works her telemonitoring machine) just here beside the telephone in the wall and this is what I sent through this morning ... I put the wee strip in there and then I prick his finger and the wee strip here, and then on a Friday I come here and it's all hooked up because some Fridays I might forget and when I get up in the morning the machine is saying \"Interview pending\". So that's where I... so then I come here and I just have to press those two buttons and put it in there, and then the thing goes through and it sends it through to the centre.\" (Carer 1) Another carer found that the equipment was also e asy to use and appropriate to her husband's condition: \"It's simple enough, I say it's only a case of once you put it on, obviously the voice starts talking to you and it takes you right through each stage, it's only a case of pressing one button, they as k you 'have you taken all his medication?' and you press 'okay', 'what's his breathing like?', 'okay', it's really only a case of pressing one button. They're simple enough questions and they're all relevant to the COPD.\" (Carer 4) Dependence and continua tion Like patients, carers expressed a strong desire to remain on telemonitoring. Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 50 \"As far as I knew it (telemonitoring equipment) was going in and that was it, and as far as I'm aware it's staying there. So here's hoping! We wouldn't want it to be going away because it has definitely made a difference.\" (Carer 2) \"We're hoping (to remain on telemonitoring), we don't know ...\" (Carer 5) \"I would tell you if it wasn't good. It's pointless having it in if it's not, you know what I mean. But I think it's brilliant.\" (Carer 3) Patient views of telehealth programme: stroke patients Four stroke patients were interviewed in their own homes. They were generally using the service for a few months and, like patients and carers previously described, were overwhel ming positive about telemonitoring. In a point which may be more relevant to stroke patients than other conditions, patients highlighted the importance of the monitoring equipment being simple: \"I can only think of what happened to me, my mind was in a com plete whirl for weeks (after the stroke), it took me weeks to get my thinking straight so if I had anything difficult (equipment) I couldn't have coped. You've got to remember, with respect, that even in a mild situation like mine you're knocked off kilter in a very different way ... you have enough in your mind to cope with, I liked that it was clear, it did the job it was meant to and it caused me no more anxiety.\" (Stroke patient 2) Patients appreciated the information they received with regular contact f rom health professionals, in particular their stroke specialist nurse. \"The service, it's not a hundred percent, it's more than that, it's superb.\" (Stroke patient 2) \"Being kept up to date, (nurse) phoned regularly ... it became a source of information between (nurse) phoning and telling you about the different readings that were coming through and it gave you confidence that somebody was there looking after you all the time.\" (Stroke patient 1) This, the patient said, was of great benefit to his health : \"It (telemonitoring) was crucial, it really, really was. Without it, (nurse) wouldn't have been able to chop and change (the medication), it was one of the last actions she did, whatever that tablet was she started to get consistent readings and then she said 'look, the telemonitoring, I'm going to take it out because we're quite happy now with the readings coming through.\" The patient was happy for the telemonitoring system to be removed after three months of use: \"It was a relief that it wouldn't have gone until it was the right time, so I was quite happy that it was going, that they think I'm reasonably well now.\" Another patient agreed that reassurance, for both him and his family, was gained from knowing that readings were being sent directly to spe cialists: \"I think it is very good because my wife is also consoled ... I think the most important thing for us was that it was going to the stroke unit.\" (Stroke patient 3) One patient said he had experienced some difficulty with the telemonitoring equipme nt, but acknowledged that this may have been because he had ignored the written instructions: \"I think it... there's one wee dial that comes up and says 'select'. I think a light comes on. That confused me a couple of times. If you see a light coming on the inclination is to press it, but I pressed it and it is supposed to be only for the technician, and then he had to come out again and show me how to use it ... the explanation was probably clear but maybe my receptors weren't keen enough.\" (Stroke patient 4) Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 51 This patient called for more communication in general from healthcare professionals as he was unsure what a variation in his blood pressure meant: \"I would like other people to have more guidelines as to what is abnormal and what's normal. Like you go to your doctor's and every time you go they take your blood pressure, and I don't know what it is. Is two degrees above norm bad or good or whatever? To the non -medical it is not an exact science. Say after this (telemonitoring) was taken off me and somebody sent just a postcard saying 'your readings were such, one of which was rather high' then you would have some feedback. A second class stamp on a postcard, it wouldn't cost that much.\" (Stroke patient 4) . 5.4.3 Patient views of telehealth programme: patie nts discharged unsuccessfully or who declined the service Invitations were sent on behalf of QUB by Fold to 100 patients who were discharged unsuccessfully or who declined the service. Two participants agreed to take part and one of these was interviewed. The other did not answer subsequent phone calls after initially agreeing to take part. An additional participant was recruited via the quantitative study. The two patients were interviewed by telephone. One did not know he had been referred to receive the service and it was never installed, and another found that it was unnecessary. The latter was offered the service after being prescribed insulin for diabetes, however she had never had a pro blem controlling her condition. \"It caused me a lot of stress be cause when I did my blood sugar in the morning and tried to send it through you couldn't get through, and you were maybe going out and thought 'will I wait or what do I do?', because I wanted to give it a fair go after them coming down and installing it. T o me it wasn't a benefit at all. I can see the benefit of it if you need to adjust y our medication or need advice.\" 5.4.4 Health professional views of the telehealth programme Participant recruitment The response rate for the 86 health professionals who were invited to take part was 52.3%. Table 13 shows numbers invited and those interviewed. Where reasons for not taking part were given, they included no knowledge/no experience of telemonitoring and therefore believed c ould offer no opinions, and no mutually suitable time to arrange an interview. Table 13 Number of health care professionals invited and interviewed Invited Interviewed Telehealth key worker 28 7 Service development manager 16 8 Pharmacist 12 10 GP 14 8 Triage nurse 10 9 Hospital doctor 16 3 Total 86 45 One interview took place face -to-face while the remaining 44 health professionals were interviewed by telephone. All participants were experienced health professionals, for example, all hospital doctors were Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 52 consultants, pharmacists had between 15 to 35 y ears' experience, general practitioners (GPs) had been qualified as GPs for between 1 and 28 years, service development managers were by definition in senior management roles and telehealth key workers were specialist nurses. Triage nurses were specialist s in their roles and all were based at the Fold headquarters, therefore Trust location is not relevant for this group. Interview duration ranged from 9 minutes to 60 minutes with the average length of interview being 22 minutes. Analysis of views The six g roups of health professional we interviewed could be categorised into those who worked directly with telemonitoring, i.e., telehealth key workers (specialist nurses who work in the community), service development managers and triage nurses; and the remaind er, those who did not, the pharmacists, GPs and hospital doctors. Accordingly, we have analysed each of these two groups separately. 5.4.4(a) Health professionals not working directly with telemonitoring (pharmacists/GPs/hospital doctors) Most views were perceived because this group had no direct experience of telemonitoring. The main themes are detailed as follows. Awareness of telemonitoring Pharmacists had little or no knowledge of telemonitoring. Those who had some knowledge had gained this through word of mouth from other professionals or by attending a seminar at which telemonitoring was mentioned. One pharmacist said during the interview that he was 'talking from a standpoint of ignorance' (pharmacist 5). Another stated their knowledge of telemonitoring was 'actually nothing, because I've never ever been involved in it' (pharmacist 6). One had learned of telemonitoring when attending a co mmunity pharmacy information event but he was not aware of any of his patients using it. \"I have a brief idea of what it involves, sort of remote access to monitoring of health but I don't know to what capacity.\" (Pharmacist 7) Another said she knew of on e of her patients who used telemonitoring and that he had found it to be of great advantage: \"He's very restricted with the amount of walking that he can do and his ability to go for hospital visits. It suits him better to be monitored at home and if there 's something happening, you know, it can be dealt with without him having to spend a physical effort.\" (Pharmacist 9) Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 53 GPs said that they were officially informed if patients had received telemonitoring. Otherwise, patients may have told them that they wer e using the service or they might receive telephone calls from community nurses monitoring their telemonitoring results. \"From records, we get correspondence saying they've been on it and then patients as well will mention it.\" (GP 1) \"I've had the odd p hone call from some of the nurses who monitor the telemonitoring.\" (GP 2) One of the three hospital doctors interviewed knew about the service because he had been to a training event when telemonitoring was being introduced to the health service. \"I am f amiliar with it and I've heard colleagues talk about it as well.\" (Hospital doctor 1). However, this was not the experience of the other two doctors; they said they would only know which patients were on telemonitoring if the patients themselves told them . \"I might have got a sideways answer from a patient that might have implied that he had been on some form of monitoring but I didn't explore it any more with him.\" (Hospital doctor 2) \"I'm aware that it's taking place and sometimes a patient who comes to my outpatient chest clinic will tell me that they're on telemonitoring and near enough that would have been the first that I would have been aware that they were.\" (Hospital doctor 3) The potential of telemonitoring Healthcare professionals perceived tha t telemonitoring had specific potential in terms of what it could do, and the types of patients who should be targeted. Pharmacists perceived that the aim of telemonitoring to increase more localised healthcare was a worthy one: \"It's an ideal situation ob viously. The theme at the moment is to try and prevent people having to stay long term within the secondary care environment and that they can have more primary healthcare and good healthcare within their own environment and at home and that primary health care can monitor their condition to prevent these readmissions into secondary care.\" (Pharmacist 10) Hospital doctor 1, who was familiar with the service, said that nursing staff would seek his approval to put a patient on telemonitoring, in this case blo od pressure monitoring, for 24 hours. \"Reducing the need to come back to an outpatient clinic and get your car parked, sit in a waiting room and then see the doctor and make your way home again when you were actually doing ok anyway is, maybe that could b e quite a big role for telemonitoring.\" (Hospital doctor 3) A GP said it was important to emphasise that telemonitoring should be used as a means to educate patients: \"If it's going to be developed in the future it's probably better to think about it as a n educational tool for a patient ... it might be better to promote the fact that their oxygen saturations are getting better and their heart failure is getting better because of the things they do rather than getting worse therefore call the doctor. So healt h promotion might be better than preventing or managing decline.\" (GP 3) Another GP said that an additional area to develop in telemonitoring would be mental health: Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 54 \"I think there are a lot of people with, not the mild end, but severe mental illness and I think telemonitoring would really benefit them. I think there is a missed opportunity there ... people with very severe mental illness and are isolated and it is very difficult to know are they getting worse or better on a day to day basis. I think it woul d make a great difference.\" (GP 2) Pharmacists suggested that their role could be exploited more because of their advantageous position within the community and being easily accessible by patients: \"I still have this vision that even from a pharmacy point of view, I think we should be wellness clinics, you know, and GPs are sickness clinics. So when you're sick you go to your GP and when you are well you go to your pharmacy and you get your blood pre ssure, your cholesterol, and all that checked to keep you well. GPs are now sort of saying 'pharmacists are a great attribute to have in our practice and to actually work with, they will do what we can't maybe do'. Like they can give us the information on blood pressure and cholesterol and that we have a bit of jointed up thinking. And I suppose this all goes towards my wellness and sickness clinic ... if we are able to do a lot of the monitoring and then refer to the GPs when things are bad.\" (Pharmacist 8) Health professionals agreed that telemonitoring would only be suitable for certain patients. \"There would be patients for whom it would be entirely unsuitable because they wouldn't actually understand how to do the thing and trying to take their own bloo d pressure might actually cause them anxiety, they might worry that they hadn't done the right thing and they weren't getting the right treatment but I think careful selection of patients would be key to that.\" (Pharmacist 4) It was pointed out that targe ting the right patient could include not only matters relevant to their physical and mental capacity but their environment as well. \"I've seen the brochure videos of people using telemonitoring, everything works perfectly. There's power to the house, there 's no children running around, the dog hasn't chewed through the cables, you know everything is perfect but you bring that into the real world you know, urbanised poor quality housing areas where they don't have BT broadband, super fibre highway, you know when things just aren't as perfect as they seem it could run into difficulties and then who passes the buck on to who then?\" (Pharmacist 7) Hospital doctors agreed that patient selection would be crucial. \"I think it is valuable but in a select group. If the patients are young and mobile and going to work and doing other things and they don't want to be tied down to a regime suggested by a third party, the telemonitoring, in that they have to be home at 10am and ring a number and that's when they take the measurements, that's our current experience.\" (Hospital doctor 1). \"I'm in favour of telemonitoring continuing but I think if that's combined with trying to select those patients or groups of patients who are going to derive genuine benefit ... there is some objective way of measuring or what the outcomes for that are published or in a peer reviewed journal for professionals to have a look at.\" (Hospital doctor 3) \"People who maybe have quite good family support and they're out and about a lot anyway pro bably don't get any added social benefit of coming up to the hospital and those who are maybe quite isolated and otherwise are just sitting in their houses from morning to bedtime maybe it's good for them to have, oh I've got my appointment with the doctor tomorrow and all. I don't think you can make one size fits all, can you?\" (Hospital doctor 3) This doctor said that consideration of the patient's potential anxiety or dependence on telemonitoring should be paramount: Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 55 \"It's making people more aware of sh ould their heart rate be seventy -five or should it be ninety -five or should it be sixty -five and then how disastrous is that if it strays slightly outside those limits so they maybe could get overanxious about small natural changes ... maybe there's an idea to conclude the telemonitoring if they do quite well for a few months and then maybe the patient says no, no, I don't want you to take that monitoring away, I've got used to that now I couldn't do without that, so that could be a downside.\" (Hospital docto r 3) Information sharing Communication between different health professions, such as GPs and pharmacists, was said by most pharmacist interviewees to be poor: \"I have no idea which patients are on telemonitoring, we have no communication.\" (Pharmacist 1) This pharmacist added that knowing which of their patients were using telemonitoring would be useful - but that lack of communication was widespread between health professions: \"It's useful to know if somebody is under telemonitoring because at least then if there is something which you're discussing, you know, you know that the person is being monitored that way, it's the lack of information and people are expecting more and more from pharmacists and people are sort of saying we should be doing this, this , this and this and unless we get information we can't do it and I have batted that for a long time.\" (Pharmacist 1) Another agreed, pointing out the usefulness of information sharing: \"The patient walks in and, as a pharmacist or a GP, you know what's going on with them rather than anecdotal.\" (Pharmacist 2) It was also stated that information sharing could be useful to assist patients who were having difficulties with working the telemonitoring devices: \"It would probably be a good thing if the pharmac ist knew how it worked (telemonitoring equipment) to help anybody who was stuck.\" (Pharmacist 6) Patients would also feel reassured if the pharmacist knew they were using telemonitoring, it was suggested: \"It would give great confidence to the patients tha t the pharmacist knew what they were doing (were on telemonitoring).\" (Pharmacist 2) An important part of information sharing and an ongoing issue for pharmacists is that they do not have access to patient electronic records, as GPs are. \"If the patient i s registered the same way as our GP, they'll have more of a sense of belonging to you and they would feel more secure with the information you're sharing on them ... issue of electronic records, that's one of the key things that's coming through when I atten d meetings. GPs are loathe to share, even information on medicines, because we're not registered.\" (Pharmacist 2) GPs also said that communication between professions could be more streamlined: \"I think more concise transfer of information. You know the m ore structured the more formatted correspondence from people rather than long winded letters basically.\" (GP 2) \"I think there's still a huge communication gap between all the various IT systems and all the clinical coding hierarchies that are used in the hospital and primary care; and even between one hospital and another; and there's not always a standard data set we get for patients coming out of hospital. So I suppose as technology advances, self -held patients' records are obviously the key to moving t hat forward because they are going to enforce one system that everything talks to, and again the patient then will have ownership of the data and be sort of the controller of their own data.\" (GP 4) Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 56 Impact on face -to-face contact The issue of maintaining face -to-face contact with health professionals was discussed and pharmacists perceived that telemonitoring may result in less such contact. This, some believed, could have negative consequences: \"You do need be careful that you don't turn peopl e into recluses, that they don't actually get any face contact at all, you know there's never, I don't think that there's an argument to be made that people don't need to be seen, that everything can be done remotely, you know we do need to still physicall y have contact with our patients on occasion, especially isolated ones.\" (Pharmacist 5) \"I'm a great believer in face -to-face contact and I would have fears that telemonitoring would be used as an easy way of cheapening the health service and by doing tha t also reducing its effectiveness. You can't tell everything over the phone, you can't make an accurate diagnosis with information given over the phone and I think you do need, a lot of the times you do need face to face contact and I'm afraid of things go ing in to too much of a virtual world.\" (Pharmacist 7) However the importance of using telemonitoring as a means to increase knowledge about the patient's own condition and, therefore, encourage self -care and increased responsibility: \"The issue is the pa tient takes responsibility for their own condition, the patient monitors their own condition with objective, easy to use tests, and they make clinical decisions for their own condition based on that without the need for reference to a general practitioner or a consultant or a pharmacist. So that's the context, whether telemonitoring improves that system is really the challenge because telemonitoring only becomes effective where that system is robust ... the problem is self -care hasn't been created as a robust system, it is jumping in ahead of the game, it's putting the cart before the horse.\" (Pharmacist 3) \"My only concern is that it could actually impinge on sort of social inclusion and it might actually create or augment the aspect of social inclusion whic h many elderly people would experience. It would be convenient for people who have mobility problems but the flip side of the coin is that it could impact on their social isolation or social inclusion.\" (Pharmacist 7) However contact via telemonitoring and knowing that readings are being monitored was perceived by some as being better than no contact: \"If you're living on your own and you're elderly and you don't have many people calling to see you, anything is a positive. And yes, you could say face -to-face is far superior because with human beings you're engaging and, you know, it's the way we are wired so to speak. But it may be the only contact that they have during the day. It seems a better option than having no contact and I suppose the older you g et the more ailments that come your way and if you feel that you are being cared for and monitored you probably feel safer, which is a good thing.\" (Pharmacist 9) Hospital doctors agreed that face -to-face contact was essential and that there were wider ne gative implications if this was reduced. \"We need to be mindful that for some respiratory conditions the treatments are very limited so actually an awful lot of what the patient gets is doctor -patient relationship and the reassurance that they have access to a doctor because we're often not curing the condition and frequently we're not well managing the symptoms from the condition and to cut the doctor -patient relationship and the ability for the patient to build the rapport with the doctor and express thei r concerns and just focusing on numbers I think would be a real shame.\" (Hospital doctor 2) \"The face -to-face consultation can provide a therapeutic element potentially ... it allows for other things to be explored. Some people might miss that opportunity i f they don't see their doctor as often because of Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 57 remote monitoring the relationship may not be developed enough to allow them to maybe express sensitive issues.\" (Hospital doctor 1) The value of seeing the person was also highlighted by GPs: \"If they get too caught up in numbers or readings rather than taking the clinical situation, there's the potential to miss things or be complacent ... You sort of know by face -to-face whether someone is sick, if you know what I mean, rather than unwell, there's varying degrees we know by eyeballing somebody.\" (GP 1) Convenience and reassurance Convenience and reassurance were perceived as key benefits by health professionals. The benefits for patients living in rural areas and those with mobility issues were raised: \"Why would they want to travel to an outpatient appointment 80 miles away and maybe sit for an hour and a half than do something that they can actually do at home while continuing their normal day living ... the rurality of Northern Ireland, that is the major advantage.\" (Pharmacist 2) \"A lot of these patients are maybe not able to leave their homes but you are able to actually touch base with them.\" (Pharmacist 8) \"I would imagine it would be extremely useful especially for patients in more rural areas or w ho have either mobility or transport difficulties.\" (Pharmacist 5) Health professionals spoke of the reassurance they believed patients would feel from constant monitoring, as well as that which they would also have because a reassured patient tends to feel better: \"If someone is quite poorly ... it probably gives them a bit of confidence ... they're less stressed about their condition because they know somebody is in close proximity. When they take their oxygen SATS or whatever it is, someone at the other end of the system is looking at that regularly and they would know if there is something there and we need to sort that out and they would be on to it ... most people tend to like the notion that someone has got their back.\" (Pharmacist 8) \"The immediate positive side that I see coming out of it is that patients maybe feel that somebody's taking an interest in them almost on a daily basis and then they find it quite reassuring and then they can go on about their day f eeling a bit more confident.\" (Hospital doctor 3) \"I see them getting some subjective benefit, which is obviously a positive for me because I like my patients to feel that they're doing well and feeling more reassured.\" (Hospital doctor 3) \"It certainly engages people a little more with their health ... COPD is a relatively frightening illness so if it gives them a little bit of assurance even if they are feeling not too bad, that their numbers are grand basically.\" (GP 2) Impact on self -care As the import ance of healthy living is being increasingly promoted, participants said it was important for patients to take more responsibility for their own health: \"I think it empowers the person that with any luck they will take an increased responsibility for their own care and ownership of the situation they're in.\" (Pharmacist 9) \"I think everybody, the population in general, need to become more invested in looking after their own health and trying to prevent becoming sick in the first place and trying to treat y ourself once you get there.\" (Pharmacist 5) Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 58 \"It would give them more awareness and ownership of a condition, the problem with society today is that people are often too willing to let everybody else take ownership of their health and it's always somebody else's problem, let somebody else deal with it and I'll get on with my life thank you very much but you know you do all the work and I'll just sit on the sofa here and watch Jeremy Kyle.\" (Pharmacist 7) While GPs were overall sceptical that telemonitoring would result in significant health improvement, they believed that it could enable greater self -care and education. \"It involves the patients more in their illness, it gives them a better understanding through taking their readings and I think through that they know, without even being prompted, how to get help for their conditions ... I think it also gives them targets to reach too because you get people who take real pride in their numbers.\" (GP 1) \"I think it puts the patients a bit more in charge of their health and it provides reassurance for them, but it mainly engages them a bit more in the whole healthy lifestyle and engages them in taking responsibility for their own health.\" (GP 2) Impact on healthcare professionals Telemonitoring was reported t o impact on healthcare professionals in terms of their workload, patterns of working and use of information. Participants said they believed their workload may be reduced with increased use of telemonitoring: \"I suppose the most useful thing is to reduce t he consultation rate, to basically take the pressure off the system.\" (Hospital doctor 1) A GP said that an increase in his workload would not necessarily be a bad thing: \"My feeling would be that it would inevitably increase my workload ... if it was appro priate that wouldn't be a problem because it might reduce it somewhere else down the line. You might catch somebody early and the decline of a condition that you can do something about before things amount to having to be out two or three times.\" (GP 3) However another GP cautioned that actually seeing patients face -to-face and getting to know them in itself eases workload: \"Once you know somebody you're more likely to take them at their word, you know the people who are worrying, whenever they worry you s hould worry, and you know the people who are always worrying and there's nothing wrong there. So I think rapport is one of the foundations of general practice that we have over the hospital specialities and I think that knowing patients actually reduces ou r workload in a way.\" (GP 1) Health professionals were asked if they would welcome the opportunity to see the data sent by patients to the telemonitoring triage nurses. \"More data is always good I think, particularly in our area. Blood pressure is particu larly an important area because of repeated measurements are very helpful and the national guidelines would encourage that.\" (Hospital doctor 1) \"As yet nobody (patient) has come in with a print -out and said this is what it's (oxygen saturation) been like over the last month or can I send these in to you every month so you can have a look over them so yes, I probably wouldn't welcome getting them sent in to me but I'm not saying that I'm not interested but I presume somebody is looking at them and therefor e unless there is some unusual trend happening that they want consultant input on I'm probably happy to leave those people to do it.\" (Hospital doctor 3) Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 59 \"I don't know whether I would have time to look at it, that's the problem. I mean I'm inundated with information now. So the prospect of getting more information and more results from people just fills me with dread, to tell you the truth.\" (GP 2) Concerns about telemonitoring There was some hesitation in accepting telemonitoring without a stronger evidence base, and concerns over costs. Doctors called for some published evidence of the effect of telemonitoring before the system was developed: \"I would be interested in evidence in terms of objective outcomes.\" (Hospital doctor 3) \"I would love to se e the evidence base to say that it prevents readmission or improves overall health outcomes for people.\" (GP 2) \"If it reduced admissions to hospital for individual patients that's probably one tangible benefit that you could measure. It's not really desi gned to improve their health, it's designed to trigger when they're bad so the health improvement would come from people actually going to see them and checking them and educating them and trying to change some of the things that they do.\" (GP 3) A GP sai d that the high cost he believed was involved in telemonitoring could be diverted elsewhere in the health service: \"I think it's an expensive way of doing what it does. It requires infrastructure behind it to keep everybody right, you're adding a third lay er into the care, you're adding the people who monitor the telemonitoring, they don't do anything other than pass on their request, they're well qualified nurses, would it not be better if they were actually directly going to somebody who knew what the con dition was and what was happening and how to do something rather than just pass on the information?\" (GP 3) A pharmacist suggested that real benefit may not result from telemonitoring: \"Disadvantages are inappropriate use, very high cost and potentially n o benefit because the patients are incapable of making decisions which will influence clinical changes to bringing round better outcomes.\" (Pharmacist 3) This participant said that alternatives could be more effective: \"The alternatives in terms of suppor ting the expert patient programmes I think is probably a more appropriate way of doing this, making sure the patients are actually very well educated about their conditions. That's not saying that can happen without telemonitoring, telemonitoring is a lit tle bit too specific, it's going to be part of a wider evolving change in the way that health services support and manage patients' long term conditions.\" (Pharmacist 3) 5.4.4(b) Health professionals engaged directly with telemonitoring (triage nurses /telehealth key workers/service development managers) Information sharing Participants agreed that shared information was very useful. Triage nurses suggested that telehealth key workers should share more detai ls on their patients: Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 60 \"We don't get a lot of information on medical history ... it's quite frustrating that we're not told what stage their COPD is at so we don't know any of their pulmonary function results because that can help us ... obviously the more you know about the patient the more you can make a decision on them.\" (Triage nurse 2) \"When we have escalated patients (to be followed up by specialist nurses) there is never a follow -up to say this lady is discharged ... we don't know what decisions have been made.\" (Triage nurse 3) \"A lot of them (specialist nurses) don't update their records ... if we have a patient that hasn't sent in a reading our process is that we try to ring them three times and if we don't get a reply we ring the telehealth key worker a nd then she'll say oh she went into hospital yesterday afternoon, we could have been saved three calls if a note had been put on there.\" (Triage nurse 5) Telehealth key workers said that the information available from telemonitoring was useful when they n eeded to share it with other professionals: \"I do find it really useful ... when you're trying to build up the evidence and provide that to GPs and get a case that the patient's blood pressure tablets should be increased or even started. The reports that you can print out and send to the GP are excellent because they look quite professional.\" (Telehealth key worker 7) Responsiveness in the delivery of care Triage nurses spoke of the unique advantage their position offered because with constant monitoring they can escalate care for a patient if necessary: \"We're recognising the symptoms of chest infections and we're acting on them quickly whereas probably in the past people have said I don't want to bother my doctor ... now they know that we've heard and you' re better to get treated now before it gets a hold of you and I think is has shown that their admissions have been reduced as well.\" (Triage nurse 4) \"If there are early discharges from hospital the patient can have the system set up and it means that a close watch is kept on their progress The GPs can have access to that as well and it makes the patient more confident about their medical condition.\" Triage nurse 5) \"People with these conditions don't want to be in hospital all the time and from that per spective it's totally invaluable.\" (Triage nurse 7) Accurate readings were said to be a significant advantage of telemonitoring: \"Some of our diabetic nurses would tell you that clients will tell you what you want to hear so when you say what's your blood glucose doing over the last week, 'oh it's been great, it's been within the normal range' and maybe without seeing that visually you take that as correct whereas this way they're able to go into the system and see exactly the dips and the highs and can pi npoint at an early stage if somebody needs treatment.\" (Service development manager 3) Another manager said that the aim of telemonitoring was to educate the patient and to enable them to develop enough confidence in managing their own condition that they are not as reliant on professionals: \"A success story would be when they get to the end of their time in telehealth and they've got a better handle on their condition that they actually don't need to see the professional as much, to me that is the end goa l.\" (Service development manager 6) A major challenge for telemonitoring was mentioned by a number of service development managers as that of dealing with patients with co -morbidities. Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 61 \"We struggle within the service to manage co -morbidities ... we sort of work around the systems as opposed to having a clear way of managing them.\" (Service development manager 4) \"So if I have COPD and I also have heart failure and diabetes ... if I'm on the system already for COPD you can't refer me to the service for diabete s. That's a big limitation.\" (Service development manager 1) Professionals said that telemonitoring should ease workload: \"It identifies worsening symptoms quicker, maybe it gives us early warning signs that the patient is going into exacerbation and it does try and prevent hospital admissions and promote self -management.\" (Telehealth key worker 4). Asked if she had seen patients who had been prevented from going into hospital, this key worker said: \"Definitely.\" However one key worker said that the servi ce had actually increased her workload: \"We found telemonitoring time consuming because we had to take time out of our day to go in and look at the readings, didn't always get the patient, left messages, they weren't always returned so we were chasing patients ...\" (Telehealth key worker 3) Reassurance and Support As everyone agreed, reassurance and support for patients and their families was said to be a major benefit of telemonitoring: \"The patients themselves say it gives them great reassurance and a back up that they have that they know there is somebody clinical looking at that every day and if there is any difficulty we will contact their specialist nurse.\" (Triage nurse 1) \"The patients get a lot of reassurance out of it knowing that their readings ar e being checked on a daily basis and if there were any alerts they know we would contact them.\" (Triage nurse 2) \"The families ... would say that it gives them reassurance if maybe they are out at work and they know that somebody will contact their mum or d ad if there is the slightest thing wrong.\" (Triage nurse 1) With reassurance came confidence, and this was widely spoken of among health professionals. \"The great strength is informing and educating patients to recognise their triggers ... it puts a bit of the responsibility back on to the actual person with the illness and it gives them a bit of confidence maybe to remain at home where previously they might have been in hospital.\" (Service development manager 4) \"Patients mostly feel very reassured that so mebody is keeping an eye on them closely. Because they've had their blood pressure monitored about four times a day in hospital and then they come out and nobody's maybe checked it for a week and we go out and it's high and they think 'Oh my goodness'. So it's nice to be able to offer that.\" (Telehealth key worker 7) Health professionals were also said to feel reassured knowing that their patients were under constant monitoring: \"It's wonderful, it can offer a great assurance to professionals in terms on o ngoing monitoring of the patient's condition and particularly those people with long term conditions.\" (Service development manager 2) \"For families, sometimes they would have phoned in looking if blood pressure or oxygen saturation is checked and this gi ves them some peace of mind.\" (Telehealth key worker 4) Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 62 All participants spoke about the support which patients experienced from telemonitoring. \"Some of the patients, they like this part of their routine now, They know they have to do their observations and they know if something is wrong we'll be ringing straight out to them.\" (Triage nurse 3) \"The fact that some of them are on their own and you can speak to them ... you can tell a lot on the phone, you can tell if they're short of breath, if they're whee zy, if they can talk to you in a sentence or not. You can really find out a lot that way.\" (Triage nurse 4) Some triage nurses reported that there have been occasions when they were able to phone an ambulance and arrange emergency care for a patient, where as if the patient did not have telemonitoring this would not have happened. \"On quite a few occasions we've had to phone 999 because they have been so unwell ... you ask the usual questions - their colour, their breathing, their pallor, and then if they woul d like us to phone an ambulance if there is no -one else in the house. In these cases we would have two members of the team involved - one would talk to the patient and keep them on the line, reassure them, and the other would phone the ambulance.\" (Triage nurse 6) \"The respiratory and heart failure teams on the ground say it's invaluable in that it provides a lot of reassurance and reduces anxiety, and that in itself helps the condition.\" (Triage nurse 7) Most telehealth key workers agreed that the service was supportive to patients, whatever condition they had. \"The women (with maternal obesity) do find it very helpful, very beneficial that the (weighing) scales are provided for them and it's a weekly thing and they can keep an eye on their weight. When they see their weight in front of them, when it's within the guidelines they find that really helpful and I think it spurs them on a bit.\" (Telehealth key worker 5) \"We're quite used to having it now and it certainly is a tool that supports and gives the patient more support than what we can give just being sole people.\" (Telehealth key worker 6) Communicating with patients Triage nurses spoke of the new skills they developed because of communicating with patients solely by telephone: \"As a nurse you 're used to observing them ... but it is amazing how quickly you can pick things up on the phone and how you do have a relationship with them and you get to know them because it is the same people, generally it's the same people who alert every day really so you do build up a great rapport with them.\" (Triage nurse 1) \"You have to hone your listening skills, really assessing the patient because sometimes they say oh I'm ok or whatever but you use your intuition skills speaking over the phone.\" (Triage nurse 3) A specialist nurse said that patients did not mind having less face to face contact because of the opportunity to talk to triage nurses at any time. \"They're happy that there's someone at the end of the phone, they often say 'I'm just so glad I can pho ne somebody' or 'those girls at telehealth are lovely, they're really helpful'.\" (Telehealth key worker 6) Everyone agreed that patient selection was crucial to successful telemonitoring, and communication was central to this in terms of identifying the r ight people: Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 63 \"If the patient is uptight, very uptight to start off with it's not suitable, or if they're extremely old or hard of hearing ... but I've really been surprised, some of the older people you thought wouldn't cope with it do. But hearing is defini tely, you know they have to be able to hear you.\" (Triage nurse 4) \"You need to be patient specific. It's not for all patients. You don't want to put it into a patient's home and then have it a) annoying or causing frustration or anxiety to the patient, o r b) you don't want to put it into someone's home that they can't use it and get the benefit of it.\" (Service development manager 1) \"We find with very anxious people it doesn't tend to, it sometimes makes them more anxious about checking their oxygen and what not. If I think they need a break from it I'll prompt them to take a break because there's some people that depend on it but they self -manage very well, there's other people depend on it but they're still not self -managing and I think that's the type of people that it's not doing any benefit for.\" (Telehealth key worker 6) Convenience for patients and professionals Some participants spoke of the convenience for health professionals that telemonitoring offered: \"It think it's fantastic as well for track and trend patients because if you take diabetes, the specialist nurses and doctors don't actually have to bring these patients into clinics to review their blood sugars and their trends, they can see them right there. Contact the patients, make adjus tments and then review them again, it's fantastic really.\" (Triage nurse 2) \"Rural areas, the patient would be quite far out from their GP and nurses at least, especially in the winter time, when the readings are done the specialist nurse can have a look and if by any chance she's not able to actually visit them she can see what the readings are like and assess them over the phone and deal with it at a distance.\" (Triage nurse 5) A service development manager said benefits to both professionals and indivi dual patients had occurred in his area: \"By putting telemonitoring into a client's home our diabetes nurses were able to reduce the number of clinics and were able to remote monitor the patients and prevent the patient having to drive to the clinic. For an elderly patient to have to arrange to come to a clinic they may need a lift from their son or daughter or neighbour; their son or daughter or neighbour may need a child minder to look after their children, so there's a whole knock -on effect.\" (Service dev elopment manager 1) \"Sometimes you can pre -empt rather than, we would have gone out and done a lot of proactive visits, sometimes we don't have to do that now, we're not going out on the one errand to check an oxygen saturation or blood pressure, the moni tor will do that and alert us.\" (Telehealth key worker 4) \"You don't have to waste that time travelling out to the patient's home to get a blood pressure. And a post like mine where the geographical spread of everybody is very wide then that's a big benef it.\" (Telehealth key worker 7) A manager pointed out that travel difficulties were not restricted to rural areas: \"We are particularly affected by that (rural areas) here and it's extreme. But I met with a community group of older ladies in (town) and the y were saying that even to get to see their doctor, their mobility wasn't as good as it used to be and particularly in the winter, if it is icy they were worried about coming out of the house, and then if they had to get a taxi, the cost of that.\" (Service development manager 2) \"They don't have to go to a treatment room, they don't have somebody like me interrupting their daily routine and coming into their home.\" (Telehealth key worker 7) It was pointed out, however that specialist nurses were still under pressure from handling alerts created from telemonitoring on top of their general work: Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 64 \"Sometimes if we get too many alerts it's an inconvenience for the clinicians ... that's tied in with parameters and getting them right at the outset. But ultimatel y if they've got what I call scheduled work, in other words booked appointments and patients to see, this (alerts) creates unscheduled work, it creates a demand that they need to be able to respond to in addition to what they've planned to do.\" (Service de velopment manager 6) A service development manager said that a significant inconvenience for health professionals was the lengthy referral form. \"The referral form is a big disadvantage and we've talking about trying to get a shortened version; if clinicia ns didn't have to spend 15, 20 minutes (completing the form) it might lend itself to more referrals coming on board.\" (Service development manager 4) A specialist nurse agreed: \"The referral itself is quite lengthy and bit of it are a bit repetitive ... the y were going to look at reducing the number of screens.\" (Telehealth key worker 5) There were some concerns about telemonitoring. A number of service development managers reported that some health professionals were not positive about adopting telemonito ring when it was first suggested. \"At the very start whenever I was working to implement the project there was quite a lot of resistance ... I think it was around a fear of change ... the main selling point to me is that it's something else that clinicians can use to support them in the best care that they want to deliver for their service users.\" (Service development manager 5) \"Despite numerous attempts at getting GP involvement, we struggle to get any of them really brought into and being champions for the service ... I would have thought it would have cut down the face to face contact, they're still getting the vital signs and they're still getting the readings, they can have a consultation over the telephone if need be, so the way I was trying to sell it to the GPs was nearly like a virtual clinic.\" (Service development manager 4) \"If it all went away tomorrow it probably wouldn't make a huge amount of difference ... I have a caseload of about 230 patients and I have 17 on telemonitoring.\" (Telehealth key w orker 2) Empowering patients Professionals said they had witnessed an improvement in self -care among patients using telemonitoring: \"It does seem to be teaching them to be better self -managers of their condition and you know even the oldest patients, of 90, it is amazing just how they then catch on we well and they will know if their oxygen levels are down slightly that day or maybe I should take it a bit easier today.\" (Triage nurse 1) \"Most of them know if their oxygen level goes below a certain level, they know to either take less exercise, relax, do their deep breathing exercises, use their oxygen more or use their ventilator. So they know a lot about their conditions and they could teach us a thing or two.\" (Triage nurse 5) \"It's empowering your pat ient giving your patient the information to make them a bit more self -managing ... they're told to look out for signs and symptoms of their condition where previously they would have just relied on the nurse to, say, call out and see me again on Friday.\" (Se rvice development manager 4) \"The specialist nurses have more empowered patients, they're maybe not having to see their patient as frequently as the patient becomes more self -aware, self -managing in relation to their condition. There was a heart failure c lient who would have been a frequent patient in and out of the hospital, frequent admissions throughout the year, since deploying the remote telemonitoring it has, and staff within heart failure would say that has prevent admissions to hospital on numerous occasions because he knows now to directly go to the staff and say 'look my SATS are up or down, my SATS are low and my sputum is quite green and I think I'm getting a chest infection' so then they can point him in the direction of the GP and get him star ted Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 65 on an antibiotic and he's at home throughout all that experience as opposed to having to be admitted.\" (Service development manager 3) While most health professionals, including telehealth key workers, agreed that telemonitoring fostered an improveme nt in self -care, a couple of specialist nurses said they had found the opposite: \"Insofar as they still don't have any insight into their condition and it doesn't encourage them to have any insight because they are relying on the monitor picking everything up. I know it's designed to promote self - management but I think in those circumstances it probably does the opposite.\" (Telehealth key worker 2) \"When we were first told about it (telemonitoring) we were very against it in that it de -skills the patient, it strips the patient of their responsibility of looking after themselves. Our aim is to try and get patients to take the initiative and responsibility of looking after themselves, checking their blood sugars and contacting us for advice. With telehealth t hey waited for us to phone them.\" (Telehealth key worker 3) However, there were some concerns about how telemonitoring could lead to an element of dependency in patients. \"You find that if the patient is on the service for months upon months, they can bec ome reliant, or mentally reliant on the service we'll say, and when you go to try to remove that service in a lot of cases they don't like that idea.\" (Service development manager 1) \"Once you put it (telemonitoring) in for these patients, even if it's me ant to be just a small amount of intervention for them, it can be very difficult to get it out again ... these are probably the more anxious patients anyway you start to suggest that you are taking this layer of monitoring away and they're really very reluct ant to give it up.\" (Telehealth key worker 2) Resources Resources were an important consideration in terms of both equipment and appropriate use of manpower. Participants spoke of difficulties with equipment, either as a result of instruments giving inaccurate readings or battery operated monitors. \"There are a lot of problems I feel with the temperature probes and the SPO2 probes.\" (Triage nurse 1) \"If more time was allocated (for the engineers) to spend in the patient's home so that they are more c onfident and that maybe they can send through two or three sets of readings so that everybody is sure what they're doing that would be a great benefit really.\" (Triage nurse 1) \"The equipment is quite outdated, there seems to be a lot of maintenance carri ed out.\" (Triage nurse 3) However some professionals pointed out the advantages to be gained from the technology: \"Maybe once a week I would go in (to the system) and review their weights ... you can access that information and it's quite useful ... I'm just looking to see a bit of a trend, you can put everything in graph or table form which sometimes can be useful to print off.\" (Telehealth key worker 2) \"I would hate to see it go because it is a tool to monitor and you know what's happening, and especially if you've been out with somebody and they've started on antibiotics, steroids and maybe haven't been that well, you can look tomorrow (in the system) and see if there are any improvements in their oxygen lev els.\" (Telehealth key worker 6) Consistent with the comment from GP 3 that the highly qualified triage nurses could be used in better way, the nurses themselves agreed: Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 66 \"With the track and trend, the diabetes and stroke, we don't really have an input in that so we're just ensuring that their readings ar e coming through. I think as nurses it's not really a satisfying role, anybody could do that, if could be done at a call centre with no clinical qualifications ... I just think sometimes your clinical skills are wasted on that (track and trend).\" (Triage n urse 1) \"Working in acute care you're very proactive with health promotion and keeping them well ... I found that quite difficult when I went to telehealth because we're not allowed to give them any advice, we're not meant to ask questions about what medication they're on ... I found that very frustrating.\" (Triage nurse 2). When asked about further developments for telemonitoring, a number of participants raised the possibility of video consultations, more health promotion and new observations to be mo nitored: \"I think it (Skype) would be a good idea ... just to see them, you can see their colour and maybe count their respiratory rate and generally do they look well.\" (Triage nurse 2) \"We're supposed to do proactive management ... there's a lot of people down the line who are in their 30s, 40s, 50s and really should be using this to get a better understanding of their illness earlier. I mean we're getting them whenever they're over 65 and they're in the palliative stage of COPD so there could be a lot of work done with practice nurses and nurse practitioners in GP surgeries.\" (Telehealth key worker 4) \"For my patients I get a blood pressure reading and a heart rate and it would be fantastic if the system could pick up any irregularities in the heart rate ... I don't know how feasible that is.\" (Telehealth key worker 7) Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 67 6. General discussion The research team have attempted to ensure that the methodology and main findings are presented in a coherent and logical sequence to allow the reader to fully understand what was measured, how it was measured and the results of the various measurements made. Results in the main body of the document are supplemented with additional data tables (as a series of appendices) to allow interested readers to gain more detailed information on topics of interest. The project was complex with broad aims and objectives. Rather than revisiting the findings, section by section, this general discussion focuses on what the research team consider the most important aspect s and findings of the overall research programme. It highlights those findings which have been seen for the first time because of this evaluation. 6.1 Methodology used The programme of work used a mixed methods approach, involving surveys, the interrogatio n of existing and linked administrative databases, and qualitative approaches (focus groups and interviews) as is current best practice in this type of research , but which also brings some challenges. The greatest challenge was gaining approvals to retriev e, link and use datasets which were owned by the HSC Trusts and held by TF3. The procedures for gaining such access were new and initially considerably slowed progress with the research. Once this hurdle was cleared, and following data cleaning, data ana lysis was reasonably straight forward within the HBS, whose staff were very supportive. The data structures, however, prevented access to the exact data desired for some of the analyses and the delays and lower than expected number of referrals in mid -2015 also caused problems. In particular, the research team had intended evaluating a prospective cohort of patients who had newly enrolled on to the monitoring programme, but, as detailed in section 4.2.1 b, this did not prove possible because only eight rece ntly installed telehealth users volunteered to join this proposed study. 6.2 Descriptive analysis The data within the descriptive analyses covered the complete programme of implementation of the telehealth service from the original start date of Decem ber 2011, for all conditions, not just those that are the focus of other parts of this report. There was a steady stream of installations over the period (ranging from 110 to 426 installations per quarter; mean per quarter 248). This is a very impressive roll -out of a new, complex service requiring very considerable administration and management. Engagement was good across all Trusts, but with varying patterns in relation to the types of patient who were referred. The NHSCT referred particularly high numbers o f patients (n=1228) . The BHSCT has the lowest number of referrals (n=456) perhaps linked to the more urban based population within this Trust. Different Trusts appeared to focus on different conditions with, for example, weight management being particula rly popular in the NHSCT, while diabetes monitoring was particularly common in the SEHSCT and the WHSCT. The SEHSCT also had the highest number of referrals for COPD. The distribution of patients across Trusts for the four targeted conditions (heart failu re, COPD, diabetes and hypertension) was variable. The number of patients receiving the hypertension 'package' ( the majority were within the NHSCT) was much lower than Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 68 for the other conditions, although blood pressure monitoring formed part of other disea se specific packages. COPD and diabetes were the two of the four targeted conditions that were most frequently monitored. Patients engaged in telehealth monitoring were distributed across all age groups (from 0 -19 to 80 -99 years), with weight management f eaturing more frequently in the younger age groupings and COPD and heart failure featuring more prominently in older patients. Diabetes care was distributed across all age groups. A good mix of male and female patients were involved, albeit with a slightl y higher proportion of females participating in the programme, driven primarily by younger females engaged in weight management programmes. The majority of patients were referred only once to the service with only 254 patients referred more than once. The majority (3826) of those using the telehealth service were reported as not having been given any education package - this will be referred to later in the short list of recommendations (Section 7). When the distribution of patients was examined against measures of deprivation, there was a good spread across all deciles of the Multiple Deprivation Measure (MDM) and the subscale for proximity to services. As expected, due to the link between high deprivation and poor health, there was an under - representat ion of patients within the least deprived deciles for both scales (MDM and proximity to services subscale). 6.3 Study results 6.3.1 View of patients, carers and healthcare professionals on the telehealth programme Although the final experimental section in the main body of the report focuses on the views and experiences of patients and carers who used the telehealth service, and healthcare professionals who are either delivering or who may be involved in delivering services to patients in the future, we discuss these findings first here because of their importance within a patient centred care environment. Support for the telehealth service was overwhelmingly positive, particularly from patients (and their carers) w ho used the service. Healthcare professionals were generally positive, but much more guarded, particularly those who had little or no direct experience of the service. Our findings agree with the general conclusions of other studies in the literature. Reas surance was a major theme throughout patient and carer interviews and focus groups. Many said that feeling reassured that a health professional was monitoring their condition allowed them to carry on with as normal a life as possible. This was a common vie w among patients with all conditions. It is consistent with a qualitative study of heart failure patients using telemonitoring by Fairbrother et al. (2014), which also identified reassurance as an important theme. In the current evaluation, doctors pointed out how reassurance and reduced anxiety was good for patients' health. Patients, particularly those with COPD, said that another major benefit of telemonitoring was 'keeping them out of hospital,' and some reported having fewer hospital stays since recei ving the service - they were understandably very keen to continue using telemonitoring. A Cochrane Review (McLean et al., Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 69 2012) examined 10 randomised controlled trials which assessed the effectiveness of telehealth among COPD patients compared to face -to-face care and found that telehealth had a positive impact on the quality of life of patients and the number of times patients visited hospital. Patients feeling secure, reassured and better educated has been reported widely (including Dinesen et al., 2013; Gale and Sultan, 2013; Riley et al. , 2013; Odeh et al., 2014; Williams et al., 2014). Healthcare professionals and patients reported that telemonitoring data had assisted in medical treatment decision and diabetes patients noted that the service had encou raged maintenance of a healthy diet. The latter was also noted by Hanley et al. (2015) in a study of 23 diabetes patients who used telemonitoring for measuring blood glucose and blood pressure control . Odeh et al. (2014) reported that general practice nu rses involved in implementing telemonitoring found their workload had increased; we also reported a n increase in workload, however, we also found that some health professionals' workload was eased as a result of the service. Patient selection was highlighted as a crucial factor in successful telemonitoring. Health professionals and carers noted that patients' parameters, i.e. the rang e within which observations are deemed normal, must be individualised. Telemonitoring seemed to be less favoured amo ng younger, more active patients, and those whose condition was well -managed and under control, and for whom it was less convenient to be at home at a stipulated time to take and upload readings. It was considered ideal, however, by and for those needing t o stabilise their condition, those who were less mobile and less able to travel, and those who benefitted most from the reassurance that the service provided. Fairbrother et al. (2012) interviewed 18 patients and five professionals involved in a telehealth service monitoring heart failure and reported that the professionals advised that a targeted approach to patient selection was necessary. Healthcare professionals pointed to the potential problem of patients becoming dependent on telemonitoring, again hig hlighting the need for careful patient selection and review. Some patients acknowledged that they relied on the service and fought against its discontinuation from their programme of care, arguing that it had prevented their need for hospitalisation or rep eated clinic visits. While health professionals tended to identify difficulties with the equipment, including that it needed updating, patients had contrasting views. The fact that the monitoring devices were simple to use was considered by patients to be of significant benefit, particularly for patients with serious illnesses for whom dealing with more complicated technology may have stressful . Healthcare professionals suggested new approaches which could be added to existing services, such as video consu ltations, but patients were generally satisfied with the current approach saying that improvements and upgrades were not needed. One patient who was discharged early as 'unsuccessful' did, however, report becoming stressed and frustrated when she was unabl e to get blood sugar levels uploaded on to the system. Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 70 Alongside their more guarded support for telemonitoring, healthcare professionals expressed their view that they wished to see more evidence of effectiveness. A number also expressed their view on the importance of face -to-face contact with patients and that robust self -care approaches involves much more than monitoring. The expense of the service and the anxiety that could be caused when the service is discontinued for a particular patient were also r aised. Generally healthcare professionals who were not directly engaged with the service felt that much better systems of communication and information sharing were required. A more minor point was that healthcare professionals who were involved with the s ervice found the referral documentation cumbersome and time consuming to complete. 6.3.2 Quantitative assessments (a) Self -care study The response rate was lower than anticipated from the group of patients who had received or were receiving this new and i nnovative service for the four targeted conditions; this limited the research team's ability to compare and contrast the findings across different types of patient or with other studies. Nonetheless, the 206 survey forms returned were in general well comp leted, demonstrating good engagement of those who participated. As expected, health related quality of life was lowest in patients with COPD and heart failure, with higher scores being obtained in patients with diabetes and hypertension. Review of litera ture values for health related quality of life in the target disease groups indicated that the present telehealth cohorts had values either similar to or lower than published mean values, indicating that the case mix of patients involved was at the more se rious end of the disease spectrum. The breakdown of data on the frequency of reported problems by dimension of the EQ -5D-5L scale highlights the type of problems still being experienced by patients. Of particular interest is the numbers of patients who re ported suffering from moderate (or above) anxiety and depression within the COPD group. This highlights a target for intervention in future services. General self -efficacy scores mirrored those for health related quality of life, with higher self -efficac y scores noted in patients with hypertension and diabetes. Disease specific self -efficacy was slightly higher for the present cohort, when compared with the published norm for COPD patients, but slightly lower in the cases of diabetes and heart failure, i .e. no consistent evidence that self -efficacy (and therefore self -care) was enhanced through use of the service in this point prevalence study. Case mix will of course influence these results, but could not be accounted for within this dataset. In a simila r vein to the anxiety and depression in COPD patients, it was clear from the results for hypertension patients that self -care adherence to low salt diets and weight management was poor, again creating targets for future monitoring services. When the qualit y of life scores and general self -efficacy score s were examined across the different categories of patients of 'not successful', 'successful', 'discharged' and 'ongoing', the data were very similar across all groups indicating that within this cohort of pa tients, health related quality of life and general self - efficacy were relatively stable and not influenced by the telehealth service provision. Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 71 (b) Effectiveness study By far the most marked finding within this part of the overall evaluation was the finding of a higher mortalit y rate (33.3%) within the quasi -control , 'Never installed' group compared with the 'Installed' group (13.9%). This was a striking finding, particularly within the COPD and the heart failure group s. The Kaplan -Meier plots showed a marked level of mortality within the first year since referral in the 'Never installed' group. Although tempting to infer that the results are indicative of the alerts generated by telehealth monitoring facilitat ing the early implementation of life savi ng interventions , it is likely that at least some of these patients did not have equipment installed because they had become morbidly unwell . Decreased mortality due to telemonitoring has , however, also been demonstrated by Dendale et al. (2012) in a study involving telemonitoring in a group of 160 patients with heart failure, but this was not reflected in a larger study (Chaudhry et al., 2010). Decreased mortality has also been demonstrated in the Whole Systems Demonstrator Project (Steventon et al., 2012 ), the largest controlled clinical trial to date on telemonitoring. In the latter study, there were also decreases in the number of elective admissions, outpatient visits and emergency department visits, but these decreases failed to reach statistical sig nificance. Interestingly quality of life and psychological outcomes were not improved in the latter study through the provision of telemonitoring (Cartwright et al., 2013). Although there were a number of testimonials from the participants in the patient focus groups regarding reduced hospitalisations and a reduced need to attend outpatient clinics, this did not carry through to the data obtained in the effectiveness aspect of the current evaluation. In general terms, the number of hospitalisations, leng th of hospital stay and outpatient clinic attendance (and therefore overall cost of healthcare provision) d id not differ between the quasi -control 'never installed' group and any of the groups who received some amount of telemonitoring. The results, where they were statistically significant, were largely driven by an anomalous result for the heart failure 'never installed' group. This lack of positive findings regarding a beneficial impact of telehealth services on healthcare resources was disappointing, however, should not overshadow the positive impact on mortality. In summary, the main impact of the telehealth service according to the objective findings in this evaluation is on mortality, while in subjective terms it is on peace of mind for the recipien ts of the service. The main limitation of the research is that the work evaluated a service that was already up and running without a robust control group and largely depended on routine administrative information rather than data collected to standards generally put in place for research purposes , and as such the strength of the evidence is compromised. A further limitation was the lack of availability of primary care health utilisation data. Nonetheless the work does allow the development of a number o f recommendations regarding the continuation and further development of the service and these are summarised in Section 7 below. Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 72 7. Recommendation s Recommendations regarding service quality improvement are as follows: 1. Engage other health care profess ionals (including GPs and community pharmacists) through improved information flows. 2. Evolve the intervention within a complex intervention framework (rather than simply self -monitoring) with formal education provision on disease state, medication managemen t, management of anxiety and depression, and self -management of symptoms. 3. Collect data alongside the delivery of the programme that could be used for research purposes with minimal disruption to the delivery of the service, such as that needed to undertake an interrupted time series analysis. Patients on enrolment could be asked to provide written consent that their data could be used for research purposes. If the service is oversubscribed, patients could be randomly allocated to the service, and as such a robust control group would naturally be in place for further service evaluation. 4. Develop strict rules for patient selection for inclusion in the service, i ncluding how co -morbidity is addressed (perhaps using simpler referral documentation). 5. Develop strict rules for withdrawal from the service, making these clear to patients from the outset. 6. Consider the lessons learned about the use of the routine administr ative data and its linking to data held by the Honest Broker Service in any future discussions of how these data are stored and accessed in order to facilitate future evaluations of this type.

(iii) Not successful: Check the variable Reason for discharge and include those with the following reasons: - Family declined service, - Patient declined service, - Non-compliance with service, - Outcome not achieved and - Other (inappropriate refe rral-only keep if referred once only, poor internet connectivity in area or inability to understand how to use monitoring equipment). If there is no \"reason for discharge\" then omit from sample as it cannot be determined whether they were successful or not successful (these will be covered in the additional patient type groups: iv and v). Referred and installed. As for the \"successful\" patient group, disregard time spent on the service. Shall have one of the study's four target conditions. There were a total of 251 people identified in the not successful group of patients, of wh om 66 were deceased. In addition to the original three pat ient types (never installed, not successful and successful), two further groups of patient were added to ensure representation and coverage of those with the four target conditions using telehealth services. This included those who had been discharged and those who were still on the service (i.e. had not been discharged), however, in both cases they had no Reason for discharge listed. The following criteria for these additional two groups was as follows: (iv) Discharged, no reason for discharge listed: There will be no reason for discharge variable. Referred and installed on the telehealth service and have been discharged. May have been on the service for a shorter or longer period of time than was proposed at the time of referral. Shall have one of th e study's four target conditions. There were a total of 299 people identified in the discha rged group of patients, of whom 78 were deceased. (v) Ongoing: There will be no reason for discharge variable (they have not been discharged). Referred, installed an d remain on the telehealth service. Shall have one of the study's four target conditions. There were a total of 742 people identified in the on going group of patients, of whom fewer than 10 were deceased. Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 77 Appendix 2: Required permissions Ethical approval was sought from the NHS REC (submitted 22 December 2014) and was given a favourable opinion on 14 January 2015 (15/SW/0015). Trust Governance in all five HSC Trusts was applied for from 5 to 17 February 2015. Approval was received for the se on 26 February 2015 (earliest) and 24 April 2015 (latest). These approvals were required to be in place before Data Access Agreements (DAAs) could be approved from all five Trust Information Governance (TIG) teams. It was determined that two separate DAAs were required. The first agreement (DAA 1: submitted 03 March 2015) was to allow Fold to send out information packs on behalf of the research team at QUB to eligible patients in relation to the questionnaire studies and also for interviews. The second ( DAA 2: submitted 10 March 2015) was submitted to enable data extraction, secure transfer to BSO ITS and finally for the HBS to hold the anonymised dataset to enable access by researchers. This was a lengthy process , the earliest signed DAAs was received by QUB on 20 April 2015 and the last on 14 July 2015 (Please see Tables 2.1 and 2.2 ).

Following feedback from the HBS Research Governance Board, additional information was provided by the research team and the application for telehealth was approved on 17 April 2015. Researchers who would be working directly with the data were also required to undertake a half day HBS Safe Researcher Training course. This was completed in advance of the telehealth dataset becoming available in the safe haven. The CCHSC compiled a Change Control Request (CCR) based on the requirements from the research team . TF3 completed an impact assessment based on this and following agreement, the telehealth dataset was extracted (within a five week work period time frame) and information packs were sent out by Fold on behalf of the research team . Study title : Evaluation of past and present implementation of Telemonitoring NI 78 Appendix 3: Data requested from TF3 (HBS dataset) Variable required for each referral Rationale Data Source 1.0 Demographic & Core patient details Deceased? (yes or no) To establish whether the patient is alive and able to be contacted to take part in the study. General Register Office (GRO): death records. Gender To categorise the patient for analyses on any disparities in relation to gender. Dataset from TF3 'Age' will be derived from the 'Date of Birth' field in the original extract. To classify the patient into appropriate age bands and enable analysis. Health & Care Number (HCN) [Pseudonymised identifier] To facilitate data linkage and enable analysis on the level of service use (patient interactions with their healthcare service). HCN will be appended to the randomised HCN (HBS to assign key using algorithm), before the HCN variable is removed to produce a pseudonymised dataset. This will produce an identifier for HBS based on HCN. Permanent home address and contact details - Postcode [SOA and Small area (or first part of postcode, eg. BT1)]. Super Output Area (SOA) to be derived from postcode by TF3. Only SOA will be included in the pseudonymised dataset. Small area or the first part of the post code will be appended to the datase t instead of the full post code. To enable analyses based on geographical area to assist with assessment of inequalities, for instance when comparing urban and rural areas. Present address and location (if different from permanent address) - Postcode (as above). 2.0 Referral data Referring Trust To enable analysis of data at Trust level and identify the HSC Trust that referred the patient for Telemonitoring NI.

Appendix 5.1 Telehealth data: descriptive overview of n = 206 questionnaire respondents This s ection provides a descriptive overview of the 206 questionnaire respondents to the self -care questionnaire (Section 5.2 a). A total of 206 patients consented to take part in the self -care questi onnaire study. Of this number, 196 were able to be linked to data held within HBS outlined below. 5.1 a Demographic information Gender: 114 males and 82 females responded.

The 'proposed length of monitoring' is set at the time of referral with the maximum length restricted to 364 days. Many referrals are renewed after this which leads to the longer duration of monitoring in the variable 'actual length of monitoring.' The 'proposed length of monitoring' variable indicated that people had been referred for 14, 42, 91 (mode), 182, 273 and 364 days.
