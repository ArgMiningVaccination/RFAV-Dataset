Each individual summary includes the request number; topic/issue; summary of the applicant's request as written by the a pplicant with occasional non -substantive editorial changes made by CMS; and CMS' final HCPCS coding decision. All new coding actions will be effective July 1, 2022, unless otherwise indicated. The HCPCS coding decisions below will also be included in the July 2022 HCPCS Quarterly Update, pending publication by CMS in the coming weeks at: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/HCPCSReleaseCodeSets/HCPCS -Quarterly -Update For inquiries regarding coverage, please contact the insurer(s) in whose jurisdiction(s) claim(s) would be filed. Specifically, contact the Medicaid agency in the state in wh ich a Medicaid claim is filed, the individual private insurance entity, the Department of Veterans Affairs, or, for local Medicare coverage determinations, contact the Medicare contractor in the jurisdiction the claim would be filed. For detailed informati on describing CMS' coverage determination process, refer to information published at https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coverage/DeterminationProcess and https://www.cms.gov/Center/Special - Topic/Medicare- Coverage -Center . CMS has a long -standing convention to assign dose descriptors in the smallest amount that could be billed in multiple units to accommodate a variety of doses and support streamlined billing. This long -standing policy makes coding more robust, and facilitates accurate payment and reporting of the exact dose administered, as only 999 units can appear on a claim line for Medicare fee -for-service using the CMS -1500 form. The dose descriptors assigned to codes established in this quarterly coding cycle are in alignment with this policy. 2 FYARROTM - HCP22010408VCD Topic/Issue Request to establish a new HCPCS Level II to identify FYARROTM. Applicant's Applicant's Aadi submitted a request to establish a new HCPCS Level II code to identify FYARRO (sirolimus protein - bound particles for injectable suspension) (albumin -bound). FYARRO TM is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic malignant perivascular epithelioid cell sirolimus as albumin- bound nanoparticles. The active ingredient is sirolimus bound to albumin which exists in the nanoparticles in a non -crystalline amorphous state. FYARRO is administered by a healthcare provider as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 of a 21- day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The recommended dose of FYARRO is 100 mg/m 2. FYARROTM is supplied as a white to yellow, sterile lyophilized powder for reconstitution with 20 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride injection, USP prior to i ntravenous infusion. Each single -dose vial contains 100 mg of sirolimus (bound to human albumin) and approximately 850 mg of human albumin (containing sodium caprylate and sodium acetyltryptophanate). Each milliliter (mL) of reconstituted suspension contai ns 5 mg sirolimus formulated as albumin -bound particles. FYARROTM in advanced malignant PEComa, a rare disease with unmet medical need, was granted Orphan Drug, Fast Track, and Breakthrough Therapy designations. The NDA application was granted Priority Rev iew classification on July 21, 2021 with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of November 26, 2021. The NDA was primarily supported by the PEC -001 study (AMPECT), a multi -center, single -arm clinical trial in 34 patients with locally advance d unresectable or metastatic malignant PEComa. FYARRO demonstrated efficacy and safety in the intended patient population, and therefore, met the evidentiary standard for effectiveness under the law. No permanent or temporary HCPCS code currently exists t hat describes FYARRO and its unique active ingredient. A unique code is needed to recognize and ensure appropriate average sales price (ASP) -based payment for FYARRO as a single source drug under section 1847A of the Social Security Act. Final Decision 1. Establish new HCPCS Level II code J9331, \"Injection, sirolimus protein- mg\" Level HCP2201032RY14 Topic/Issue Request to establish a new HCPCS Level II code to identify LEQVIO\u00ae. Applicant's suggested \" Injection, inclisiran, 1 mg\" Applicant's Summary Novartis submitted a request to establish a new HCPCS Level II code to identify LEQVIO\u00ae. LEQVIO\u00ae contains inclisiran sodium, a small ligand containing three N - acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues to facilitate delivery to hepatocytes. Novartis received approval for LEQVIO\u00ae from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on December 22, 2021. No existing HCPCS code specifically describes this product. A unique J code is necessary to ident ify and reimburse LEQVIO\u00ae and appropriately implement current Medicare payment policy for single source drugs. LEQVIO\u00ae is indicated as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercho lesterolemia (HeFH)] or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular who require additional lowering of low -density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL -C). Inclisiran is a double -stranded ribonucleic strand to facilitate uptake by hepatocytes. In hepatocytes, inclisiran utilizes the RNA interference mechanism and directs catalytic breakdown of mRNA for PCSK9. This increases LDL -C receptor recycling and expression on the hepatocyte cell surface, which increases LDL -C uptake and lowers LDL -C levels in the circulation. The recommended dose for LEQVIO\u00ae, in combination with maximally tolerated statin therapy, is 284 mg initially, again at 3 months, and th en every 6 months, administered through a single subcutaneous injection. LEQVIO\u00ae is supplied in a single -dose prefilled syringe containing 284 mg/1.5 mL (189 mg/mL) of inclisiran. Final Decision Establish new HCPCS Level Topic/Issue Request to establish a new HCPCS Level II code to identify celera Dual Membrane and celera Dual Layer . Applicant's Layer\" Applicant's Summary Nvision Biomedical Technologies, Inc. submitted a request to establish a new HCPCS Level II code to identify celera Dual Membrane and celera Dual Layer. celera Dual Membrane and celera Dual Layer products are minimally manipulated human amniotic and/or chorionic membrane products derived from placental tissues that retain the structural and functional characteristics of the tissues. The final product is dehydrated, packaged in different size sheets and terminally sterilized by irradiation. These products consist primarily of extracellular matrix proteins and serves as a natural, biologic barrier. The typical patient population includes patients requiring a wound cover or skin substitute for cutaneous wounds. The celera Dual Membrane and celera Dual Layer products are used by qualified health care professionals in a physician office, outpatient, or inpatient setting. The dosage is per centimeter square (cm 2), depending on the size of the injury or site of application. celera Dual Membrane and celera Dual Layer products are supplied in various size and configuration sheets with a total of 1 to 49 cm2 and are stored at ambient temperature. There is currently a generic, nonspecific HCPCS Level II code (Q4100) that is reported for the use of these types of products as well as brand specific codes. A new code is warranted so that it may be readily identified for third party claims processing. Final Decision Based on written feedback from the FDA's Tissue Reference Group (TRG), celera Dual Layer and celera Dual Membrane, \"when intended to serve as a wound cover or skin substitute for cutaneous wounds, appear to meet all the criteria for regulation solely under section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and the regulations in 21 CFR part 1271.\" As a result of our review of the TRG's feedback, CMS has decided to: Establish new HCPCS Level II code Q4259, \"Celera dual layer or celera dual membrane, per Effective: 7/1/2022 5 Signature APatch - HCP2112294NVQN Topic/Issue Request to establish a new HCPCS Level II code to identify Signature APatch .

SUSVIMO intraocular drug delivery system is designed to be used specifically with SUSVIMO. The system consists of an intraocular implant along with ancillary devices used to fill, insert, and explant (if needed) the implant. SUSVIMO, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor, is indicated for the treatment of patients with neovascular (wet) age -related macular degeneration (AMD) who have previously responded to at least two intravitreal injections of a VEGF inhibitor. The recommended dose of SUSVIMO is 2 mg (0.02 mL of 100mg/mL solution) continuously delivered via the SUSVIMO ocular implant with refills administered every 24 weeks (approximately 6 months). Each SUSVIMO initial fill needle kit (NDC 50242 -078-55) contains one SUSVIMO 100mg/mL single -dose glass vial and one SUSVIMO initial fill n eedle (for initial fill and implant procedure). Each SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) carton (NDC 50242- 078-12) contains 100mg/mL single vial (for refill- exchange procedure). Each SUSVIMO refill needle carton contains a SUSVIMO r efill needle. There is currently no unique HCPCS Level II code that describes SUSVIMO. Final Decision 1. Establish new HCPCS Level II code Topic/Issue Request to establish a new HCPCS Level II code to identify RYPLAZIM\u00ae. Applicant's RYPLAZIM\" Applicant's Summary Kedrion Biopharma Inc. submitted a request to establish a new HCPCS Level II code to identify RYPLAZIM\u00ae . RYPLAZIM\u00ae is a Glu -plasminogen (> 95% purity) which is the native circulating form of plasminogen in the blood. RYPLAZIM\u00ae is a sterile, white to off -white, lyophilized preparation of purified, plasma -derived plasminogen (human) to be reconstituted and ad ministered by the intravenous route. Each vial of RYPLAZIM\u00ae contains 68.8 mg of plasminogen. Following reconstitution with 12.5 mL of sterile water for injection (SWFI), the RYPLAZIM\u00ae solution contains 5.5 mg/mL plasminogen preservatives. the plasminogen is determined by a chromogenic assay calibrated with a standard plasminogen deficiency type 1 and is characterized by decreased plasminogen levels that cause formation of fibrin -rich, ligneous pseudomembranous lesions on mucous membranes that can impair normal tissue and organ function. Replacement therapy increases the plasma level of plasminogen enabling a temporary cor rection of the plasminogen deficiency and reduction or resolution of extravascular fibrinous lesions. No current HCPCS code adequately describes or differentiates RYPLAZIM\u00ae from other therapies; therefore, there is a programmatic need for CMS to create and assign a unique HCPCS code. As mentioned previously, RYPLAZIM\u00ae was FDA approved under a BLA. Therefore, it meets CMS' current definition of single source drug and for purposes of implementing the ASP statute, must be assigned its own unique billing code. RYPLAZIM\u00ae indicated for the treatment of patients with plasminogen deficiency type 1 (hypoplasminogenemia). Treatment with RYPLAZIM temporarily increases plasminogen levels in blood. The recommended dosage of RYPLAZIM is 6.6 mg/kg body weight administered intravenously every 2 to 4 days (Q2D to Q4D). Final Decision 1. Establish new HCPCS is available for use to specify th e route of administration. 2. Discontinue existing HCPCS Level II Request to establish a new HCPCS Level II each\" Applicant's Summary Bausch & Lomb submitted a request to establish a new HCPCS Level II code to identify XIPERE. XIPERE is a sterile, p reservative -free, injectable suspension of triamcinolone acetonide, a synthetic corticosteroid for use with the SCS Microinjector\u00ae. The chemical name (glucocorticoids are often referred activity. XIPERE (triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension) 40 i s indicated treatment of macular edema associated with uveitis. Triamcinolone acetonide is a synthetic (glucocorticoids are often referred to as corticosteroids) with immunosuppressive and anti - inflammatory activity. The primary mech anism of action for triamcinolone acetonide is as a corticosteroid hormone receptor agonist. It is to be use for suprachoroidal injection using the SCS Microinjector\u00ae. The recommended dose of XIPERE is 4 mg (0.1 mL of the 40 mg/mL injectable suspension). Suprachoroidal injection using the SCS Microinjector\u00ae, which is part of the larger package as described above and below. The suprachoroidal injection procedure should be carried out under controlled aseptic conditions, which include the use of sterile glov es, a sterile drape, a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent), and a sterile cotton swab. Adequate anesthesia and a broad -spectrum microbicide applied to the periocular skin, eyelid, and ocular surface are recommended to be given prior to the suprachoroid al injection. Please see attached FDA label for further detail on the 19 steps required to safely administer XIPERE via the microinjector syringe with vial adapter. XIPERE is supplied as part of a larger package with the following sterile components for administration, sealed in a Tyvek covered tray, and one single -dose glass vial, in a carton with a package insert (NDC71565 - 040-01): One SCS Microinjector\u00ae syringe with vial adapter attached; One 30 -G x m needle; One 30 -G x mg/mL (NDC 71565- 040-25), which is not separately commercially available. Final Decision 1. Establish new HCPCS Level II code J3299, \"Injection, triamcinolone acetonide Effective Request to establish a new HCPCS Level II to identify VYVGART Summary Ar genx submitted a request to establish a new HCPCS Level II code to identify VYVGART mg.\" VYVGART was approved by the FDA on December 17, 2021 and is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti -acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody to the neonatal Fc Receptor (FcRn), resulting in the reduction of circulating IgG. The recommended dose of VYVGART in gMG patients is 10 mg/kg as a 1- hour intravenous infusion to be administered in treatment cycles of once weekly infusions for 4 weeks. In patients weighing 120 kg or more, the recommended dose of VYVGART is 1200 mg (3 vials) per infusion. VYVGART injection is a preservative free, steril e, colorless to slightly yellow, clear to slightly opalescent solution supplied in one 20 mL single -dose vial per carton. Each single- dose 20 mL vial contains 400 mg efgartigimod alfa -fcab at a concentration of 20 mg/mL. No existing HCPCS code describes VY VGART. Currently, providers must use miscellaneous/unclassified codes. Miscellaneous codes do not describe VYVGART, nor are they appropriate for permanent use or for facilitating optimal claims processing, payment, or utilization tracking. For this reaso n, a unique code that adequately and specifically describes VYVGART is needed. Final Decision Establish new HCPCS Level II J9332, Topic/Issue Request to establish a new HCPCS Level II code to identify Illuccix\u00ae. Applicant's suggested language: A95XX \"Illuccix\u00ae (kit Gallium Ga -68 Gozetotide injection) (Gozetotide is also known as PSMA -11) (diagnostic, per 1 millicurie)\" Applicant's Summary Telix Pharmaceuticals (US), Inc., submitted a request to establish a new HCPCS Level II code to identify Illuccix\u00ae. Presently there is no HCPCS code assigned for Illuccix\u00ae (k it for the preparation of Gallium Ga - 68 Gozetotide injection (Gozetotide is also known as PSMA -11). It will be reported with not HCPCS ation, not otherwise classified) or A4641 (Radiopharmaceutical, diagnostic, not otherwise classified) as an alternative for commercial payers that will not accept A9597. Using either HCPCS code prevents concise tracking of utilization, often results in und er-payment, and may result in incorrect billing. An \"A\" HCPCS code with verbiage such as A95XX Illuccix\u00ae (kit for the preparation of Gallium Ga - 68 Gozetotide injection (Gozetotide is also known as PSMA -11) (diagnostic, per 1 millicurie) would be the most appropriate code and is being formally requested through this process. Illuccix\u00ae is a radioactive diagnostic agent indicated for positron emission tomography (PET) of prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positive lesions in men with prostate cancer wi th suspected metastasis who are candidates for initial definitive therapy or men with suspected recurrence based on elevated serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) level, granted FDA approval on December 17, 2021. Use of Illuccix\u00ae may allow for more concise treatment planning by improving staging and restaging of prostate cancer through greater detection of metastasis outside the prostate and avoiding localized treatments such as radiation therapies (external beam or brachytherapy) or radical prostatectomy, in the presence of metastatic disease. Illuccix\u00ae is also effective in prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence post definitive therapy. Rising PSA indicates the patient has recurrent disease, but not the location of the disease. Illuccix\u00ae helps localize metastatic disease, which in turn allows providers to choose the appropriate treatment based on where the disease is localized. Illuccix\u00ae is administered as an intravenous bolus injection and the recommended dose is 5mCi. Illuccix\u00ae is supplied as a 3-vial kit which contains the non -radioactive ingredients needed to produce 68GA PSMA -11 Injection. There are 2 configurations available to allow preparation of Ga- 68 PSMA -11 using Ga -68 from different generator or cyclotron sources . Configuration A is used for Ga -68 produced by cyclotron via GE FASTlabR or for Ga -68 obtained from a Eckert & Ziegler Galliapharm Ge 68/Ga -68 generator . Configuration B is used for Ga -68 obtained from an IRE Galli Eo\u00ae Ge 68/Ga -68 generator. Due to two options for generators, there are two NDC numbers for Illuccix\u00ae, 74725- 0100- 25 and 74725- 0100- 64. Final Decision HCPCS Level II Topic/Issu e Request to establish a new HCPCS Level II code to identify TAUVID . Applicant's suggested language: A95XX \"flortaucipir F 18 injection, diagnostic, per study dose, up to 10 mCi\" Applicant's Summary Eli Lilly submitted a request to establish a new HCPCS Level II code to identify TAUVID (flortaucipir F 18 injection). TAUVID is a radioactive diagnostic agent indicated for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the brain to estimate the density and distribution of aggregated tau neurofibrillar y tangles (NFTs) in adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer's disease (AD). TAUVID is not indicated for use in the evaluation of patients for chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Flortaucipir F 18 binds to aggregated ta u protein. In the brains of patients with AD, tau aggregates combine to form NFTs, one of two components required for the neuropathological diagnosis of AD. In vitro, flortaucipir F 18 binds to paired helical filament (PHF) tau purified from brain homogena tes of donors with AD. The dissociation constant (Kd) of flortaucipir F 18 binding to PHFs 0.57 nM. In vivo, flortaucipir F 18 is differentially retained in neocortical areas that contain aggregated tau. In vitro, tritiated flortaucipir has been reported to bind with low nanomolar affinity to monoamine oxidase -A and monoamine oxidase -B, which could contribute to off target binding. The recommended amount of radioactivity to be administered for PET imaging is 370 MBq (10 mCi), administered as an intraveno us bolus injection in a total volume of 10 mL or less. Approximately 80 minutes after the TAUVID intravenous injection, a 20 -minute PET image with the patient supine is obtained. TAUVID injection is supplied by Eli Lilly in a 30 mL or 50 mL multiple -dose vial (30 mL: (IC1210)) containing a clear, colorless solution free of visible particulate matter at a strength of 300 MBq/mL to 1,900 MBq/mL (8.1 mCi/mL to 51 mCi/mL) flortaucipir F 18 at end of synthe sis. Each vial contains multiple doses and is enclosed in a shield container to minimize external radiation exposure. Per the FDA label, the recommended dose for each patient is a fixed dose of 10 mCi (not weight - based dosing). Eli Lilly supplies TAUVID i n a multi -dose (not single -dose) vial to the radiopharmacy. The radiopharmacy provides enough TAUVID in a patient -specific syringe, each with the necessary amount of product to be 10 mCi at the time of administration calculated at the time of distribution to the imaging facility to account for the level of anticipated radioactive decay during transit. At the place of service, all patient doses administered are calculated at 10 mCi at the time of administration. This further supports the request for \"per dose\" HCPCS units dosage. Final Decision Establish new HCPCS Level II code A9601, \"Flortaucipir f 18 injection, millicurie\" Effective: 7/1/2022 13 cutaquig\u00ae - HCP220104DXPL8 Topic/Issue Request to establish a new HCPCS Level II code to ident ify cutaquig\u00ae . Applicant's 100 mg\" Applicant's Summary Octapharma USA, Inc. submitted a request to establish a new HCPCS Level II code to identify cutaqui g\u00ae. cutaquig\u00ae is a solvent/detergent -treated, sterile preparation of highly purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) derived from large pools of human plasma. cutaquig\u00ae prevents infections of a wide variety of bacterial and viral agents in immunodeficient adults by temporarily restoring IgG levels in circulating plasma. cutaquig\u00ae was approved under a unique biologics license application (BLA) and has no therapeutic equivalents. Thus, cutaquig\u00ae is a biological under the average sales price (ASP) statute and warrants a unique code under CMS's implementation of that statute. The existing subcutaneous immune globulin (SCIG) codes (J1555, J1559, J1575) cannot be used for cutaquig\u00ae because each code includes a different product name and because it would set payment for cutaquig\u00ae based on ASP information for other products. cutaquig\u00ae is indicated as replacement therapy for primary humoral immunodeficiency (PI) in adults and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. This includes, but is not limited to, common variable imm unodeficiency (CVID), X -linked a broad spectrum of opsonizing and neutralizing IgG antibodies against a wide variety of bacterial and viral agents. For patients switching to cutaquig\u00ae from intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) the weekly dose is calculated by dividing the monthly IVIG dose in grams by the number of weeks between IVIG infusions and then multiply this value with a dose adjustment factor of 1.30. For patients switching to cutaquig\u00ae from SCIG, it is recommended to maintain the same weekly dosing (in grams) as was used for the previous SCIG product. cutaquig\u00ae is intended for the subcutaneous route of administration. Final Decision Establish new HCPCS Level II code J1551, \"Injection, \"administered subcutaneously\" is available for use to specify the route of administration. 14 TEZSPIRE - HCP211222BJ3E1 Topic/Issue Request to establish a new HCPCS Level II identify Amgen submitted a request to establish a new HCPCS Level II code t o identify TEZSPIRE (tezepelumab - ekko). TEZSPIRE is indicated for the add -on maintenance treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with severe asthma. TEZSPIRE is not for relief of acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus. The U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the biologics license application (BLA) for TEZSPIRE on December (IgG2) that binds to human TSLP with a dissociation constant of 15.8 pM and blocks its interaction with the heterodimeric TSLP receptor. TSLP is a cytokine mainly derived from epithelial cells and occupies an upstream position in the asthma inflammatory cascade. A unique code is needed to recognize the approval of TEZSPIRE under an original BLA and ensure appropriate average sales price (ASP) -based payment under section 1847A of the Social Security Act. TEZSPIRE is administered by a healthcare provider as a subcutaneous injection. The recommended dose of TEZSPIRE is 210 mg administered once every four weeks. TEZSPIRE is a clear to opalescent, colorless to light yellow solution available in two forms: a single -dose vial with a carton containing one 210 mg/1.91 mL (110 mg/mL) glass vial, and a single -dose pre -filled syringe with a carton containing one 210 mg/1.91 mL (110 mg/mL). TEZSPIRE was granted breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA on September 6, 2018 for patients with severe asthma without an eosinophilic phenotype bas ed on the tezepelumab Phase 2b PATHWAY data which demonstrated a significant reduction in the annual asthma exacerbation rate compared with placebo in a broad population of severe asthma patients independent of baseline blood eosinophil count or other type 2 inflammatory biomarkers. Additionally, TEZSPIRE was granted priority review by the FDA on July 7, 2021 based on results from the PATHFINDER clinical trial program, including results from the pivotal NAVIGATOR Phase 3 trial, in which tezepelumab demonst rated superiority across every primary and key secondary endpoint compared to placebo in a broad population of patients with uncontrolled asthma while receiving treatment with medium - or high -dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus at least one additional controller medication with or without oral corticosteroids (OCS). Final Decision Establish new HCPCS Level Request to establish a new HCPCS Level II Applicant's Summary Charles River Associates, Inc. submitted a request to establish a new HCPCS Level II code to identify the APRETUDE kit for injection. APRETUDE contains cabotegravir extended -release (INSTI). APRETUDE is FDA -approved to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV -1 infect ion. No currently available codes describe APRETUDE as it is newly approved via a new drug application (NDA). APRETUDE is indicated in at -risk adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg for pre -exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV -1 infection. Individuals must have a negative HIV -1 test prior to initiating APRETUDE (with or without an oral lead-in with oral cabotegravir) for HIV -1 PrEP. APRETUDE must be administered healthcare provider by gluteal intramuscular inj ection. APRETUDE is supplied injectable suspension, 1 syringe, 1 vial adapter, and 1 needle for intramuscular injection (23 gauge, 1 \u00bd inch) (NDC 49702 -264-23). Final Decision Establish Request to establish a new HCPCS Level II code to identify RETHYMIC\u00ae. Applicant's suggested Enzyvant Therapeutics GmbH submitted a request to establish a new HCPCS Level II code to identify RETHYMIC\u00ae (Allogeneic processed thy mus tissue - agdc). RETHYMIC\u00ae is engineered human thymus tissue designed to regenerate the thymic function children with congenital athymia are missing and is administered as a one -time regenerative tissue -based therapy for immune reconstitution in pediatr ic patients with congenital athymia, an ultra -rare disease with an estimated incidence in the U.S. of seventeen (17) to twenty -four (24) live births each year. Patients are born without a thymus, a condition that causes profound immunodeficiency, life - threatening immune dysregulation, and high susceptibility to potentially fatal infections and before RETHYMIC\u00ae there was no effective treatment for congenital athymia, and most patients die by two years of age. RETHYMIC\u00ae was granted FDA approval on October 8, 2021. RETHYMIC\u00ae therapy consists of slices of processed tissue and the dosage is determined by the surface area of the RETHYMIC\u00ae slices and recipient body surface area (BSA). The recommended dose range is 5000 to 22,000 mm2 of RETHYMIC\u00ae surface area/m2 recipient BSA. The manufacturer calculates the dose for the specific patient, the amount of product provided is adjusted at the manufacturing facility to ensure the maximum dose for the patient cannot be exceeded. Surgical implantation of allogeneic processed thymus tissue product (RETHYMIC\u00ae) should be done by a qualified surgeon.

Information for submitting questions to the FDA's to establish a new Level II language: from 10mm to 120 sq cm\" Applicant's Summary Celularity Inc. submitted a request to establish a new HCPCS Level II code to identify Biovance\u00ae Tri- Layer and 3L Biovance\u00ae. The processing of the tissue involves the separation of the amnio tic membrane from the chorionic membrane followed by cleaning using a mild detergent, scraping, and rinsing. The membrane is folded upon itself to create a tri -layer thickness, dehydrated, packaged, then sterilized using e- beam irradiation. The name is 3L Biovance\u00ae Human Amniotic Membrane Allograft (referred to as 3L throughout document). Dehydrated human membrane allografts are human tissue allograft intended for use as a cover or to protect from the surrounding environment in wound and surgical repair and reconstruction procedures. Applications include, but are not limited to, application to partial- and full -thickness, acute and chronic wounds (such as traumatic and complex wounds, burns, surgical, and Mohs surgery sites; and diabetic, venous, arterial, p ressure, and other ulcers), including wounds with exposed tendon, muscle, bone, or other vital structures. For many uncomplicated wounds, traditional surgical dressings will suffice and enable a wound to heal in an orderly and timely manner. However, in va rious areas of medicine, wound care physicians often encounter chronic non -healing wounds that have poor rates of healing or are entirely resistant to closure. It is for these difficult -to-heal wounds and patients with a history of delayed healing that adv anced biologic products such as 3L are particularly well -suited. The quantity and size of the product used will vary based upon wound size and physician recommendation. 3L is packaged as a sterile product in sealed, single -use pouches.
