The first is the actual expense from customer accounts that remain 3 uncollected 90 days after their account has moved to a final status (note that a final status indicates that they are no longer a customer). 4 The second component is the reserve for uncollectible accounts. Each month the reserve is calculated to determine the collectability 5 of the accounts receivable portfolio. This value is compared to the amount reserved in the previous month and the difference used 6 to adjust the actual account expense. This total is then recorded as the total uncollectible accounts expense. 7 Outside Collection Agency Expenses 8 Expenses for outside collection agencies for the year 2021 are $1,354,181. The jurisdictional portion of the 2021 total Company 9 amount is estimated to be $792, 295. Total Company expenses for outside collection agencies were: $821,074, $940,552, and $993 ,492 10 for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.

Final bill agencies receive accounts that 3 have not paid their final bills from ComEd at Day 35 in the collection process stream. These agencies are given 120 days to work the accounts through their 4 processes to attempt collection. If the agency is successful in retrieving money owed, they are paid a commission. If unsuccessful, the account is retrieved 5 by ComEd and charged off (written off). Charge-off agencies receive the charged-off accounts the day after they are written off. Currently these agencies work 6 the written-off accounts until ComEd retrieves them for some other type of treatment such as debt sale. These agencies differ from final bill agencies in the 7 time frame in which they are allowed to work the accounts and their overall commission incentives. In an effort to increase recoveries, both tiers have the 8 ability to report delinquent customers to credit bureaus, after following the FDPPA (Federal Debt Protection Practices Act) guidelines. 9 Collection Agency Results: 10 In 2021, 107,178 accounts with a total value of $54.1 million was sent to final bill agencies. Approximately 9.2%, or $4.6 million was collected in 2021. Also, 11 101,359 accounts with a total value of $62.9 million was sent to charge-off agencies and approximately $2.3 million was collected from them in 2021.

For item (i) above, \"any service that has been declared to be competitive pursuant to Section 16- 113 of this Act\", ComEd notes that service for customers with peak demand of 100 ki lowatts and above was declared competitive in accordance with the Illinois Commerce Commission's Order in Docket No. 07 -0478 i ssued pur suant to Section 16- 113 of the Act, as amended by P ublic Act 095- 481 w hich was enacted A ugust 28, 2007. With respect to item (ii) above , \"contract service\", Section 16- 102 of the Act provides that \"contract service\" means (1) services, including the provision of electric pow er and energy or other services, that are provided by m utual agreement between an electric utility and a retail customer that is located in the electric utility's service area, provided that, delivery services shall not be a contract service until such services are declared competitive pursuant to Section 16- 113; and also means (2) the provision of electric power and energy by an electric utility to retail customers outside the electric utility's service area pursuant to Section 16- 116. P rovided, how ever, contra ct service does not include electric utility ser vices provided pur suant to (i) contracts that retail customers are required to execute as a condition of receiving tariffed services, or (ii) special or negotiated rate contracts for electric utility services that were entered into between an electric utility and a retail customer prior to the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1997 a nd filed with the Commission. Thus, C omEd states that no customers took \" contract service\" as defined above. For item (iii) above , \"services, other than tariffed services, that are related to, but not necessary for, the provision of electric pow er and energy or delivery services\", ComEd states that no s uch services were provided.
