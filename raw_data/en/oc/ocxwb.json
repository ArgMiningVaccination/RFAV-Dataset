Healthcare personnel -any paid or unpaid persons working in healthcare serving in healthcare settings who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to patients or infectious materials 1b.

Interim Framework for COVID -19 Vaccine Allocation and Distribution in the United States, JHU, August 2020 Goals: -Prevent COVID -19-related illness and death -Prevent injury, illness, and death from other causes (non -COVID -19) -Protect the health system -Protect essential services -Enable economic activity more broadly -Enable children and adult staff to return to school and childcare -Among systematically disadvantaged groups and marginalized populations Reduce higher rates of severe COVID -19 illness and mortality Address disproportionate economic and social impact -Protect those at highest risk of severe illness and death, especially those with the most years of life left to live -Reduce burdens on those with both high health and economic risks Note: All authors prioritization with regards to goals and principles Close contacts of people at very high risk ( eg, nursing home and long -term care facility workers, home health aides, household contacts of those at very high risk ) Health system workers in contact with COVID -19 patients ( eg, nursing home and long -term care facility residents and workers; healthcare workers assigned to care for COVID -19 patients; frontline healthcare workers doing direct patient care; emergency medical services personnel) Healthcare workers (including healthcare support staff such as environmental, food, and maintenance services ) Emergency medical services personnel Workers needed for the vaccination effort ( eg, vaccinators, vaccine and supply chain workers) Workers (essential or nonessential) who cannot work remotely and have higher infection risk or risk of poor outcomes ( eg, workers with comorbid conditions) Worker groups with a high rate of lower -income workers ( eg, home health aides, long -term care facility workers , food retail workers, farmworkers) Essential workers with comorbid conditions Essential workers with high risk household contactsJHU Framework -HCP considered as Vaccination Phase 1 Candidates Those most essential in sustaining the ongoing COVID -19 response Frontline health workers providing care for COVID -19 patients Frontline emergency medical services personnel Pandemic vaccine manufacturing and supply chain personnel COVID -19 diagnostic and immunization teams Public health workers carrying out critical, frontline interventions in the community Those most essential to maintaining core societal functions Frontline long -term care providers Healthcare workers providing direct care to patients with high -risk conditions Those at greatest risk of severe illness and death, and their caregivers \"Frontline\" not defined in table of candidate groups for prioritization. National Academy of Medicine Framework For Equitable Allocation of COVID -19 Vaccine Principles: Maximize benefits * Equal regard * Mitigate health inequities * Fairness * Evidence -based * Transparency Overarching goal : Maximize societal benefit by reducing morbidity and mortality caused by transmission of SARS -CoV-2 Allocation criteria are risk based Individuals have higher priority to the extent of their: -Risk of acquiring infection -Risk of severe morbidity and mortality -Risk of negative societal impact -Risk of transmitting disease https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25917/framework -for-equitable -allocation -of-covid -19-vaccine . National Academy of Medicine Framework For Equitable Allocation of COVID -19 Vaccine Phase 1a. High -risk health workers (e.g., in hospitals, nursing homes, or providing home care) -those involved in direct patient care. -Specifically includes workers who provide transportation, environmental services, and others who risk exposure to bodily fluids or aerosols. -Rationale: critical role in maintaining health care system, high risk of being exposed to COVID -19 by patients, and risk of transmitting the virus to others, including family -Workers in communities disproportionately impacted by COVID -19 Phase 1a. First respondersNational Academy of Medicine Framework For Equitable Allocation of COVID -19 Vaccine Phase 1b. -Older adults living in congregate settings \u2014such as nursing homes or skilled nursing facilities \u2014and other similar settings. -Individuals with select high -risk comorbid and underlying conditions Phase 2 -K-12 teachers and school staff -Other workers in essential industries -Older adults -Adults with high risk conditions -Persons living in congregate settings and staff (corrections, group homes, homeless shelters)National Academy of Medicine Framework For Equitable Allocation of COVID -19 Vaccine Phase 3 -broad immunization of other workers, young adults and children (if vaccines tested in children) Phase 4 -persons interested in vaccination for their personal protectionIdaho DRAFT COVID -19 Vaccine Program Goals Reduce transmission, severe illness and death Preserve functioning of healthcare system Recover functioning of society Protect persons at risk who have access and functional needs Ensure equitable distribution and the equity of opportunity to enjoy health and well -beingPrinciples and Factors Considered Ethical frameworks published by others described above Risk of severe disease or death (e.g., because of age, medical conditions, race or ethnicity) Risk of exposure to COVID -19-infected persons based on occupation, the ability to physically distance, access to personal protective equipment (PPE), and living circumstances (e.g., congregate or crowded living conditions). Risk of exposing others who are at increased risk of severe disease or death (e.g., live with or caregiver for those at increased risk) Impact of occupation on resuming community functioning Maintenance of community safety, including law and order Feasibility of implementation for specific vaccine productsDiscussion Goals -Any that should be added or changed? Principles and factors considered -Any that should be added or changed?Hospital and clinic staff essential for care of COVID -19 patients and maintaining hospital capacity.^~32,117 = hospital staff per ID Division of Licensing and Certification (IDLC) LTCF staff Home care providers for adults age 65 years and other adults and children with high risk medical conditions. ~12,500-14,500 per IDLC Emergency Medical Services (EMS)*~4,128 -per https://www.nremt.org/rwd/public/data/m aps/ .

Assumes 50% able to teleworkDiscussion Questions What are thoughts about subprioritizing HCP for vaccine in the order described? Would the committee prefer more specific categories?Future Discussions on Healthcare Personnel Vaccination Discussions will include how to achieve equity in COVID -19 vaccine distribution to -Rural settings -Nursing home and assisted living facility staff -Home healthcare -Private providers and staff not affiliated with hospitals Part time, full time, contracted, private practice, smaller practicesThank you! The public are invited to submit written comments on health care provider prioritization through designated email address covid19vaccinepubliccomment@dhw.idaho.gov Based on today's discussion and written comments that we receive through Wednesday, October 28, 2020, we will send revised goals and principles and factors considered in subprioritizing vaccine for HCP voting by committee members on November 2, 2020.
