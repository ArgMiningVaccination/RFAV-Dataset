If you have been to the doctor for your child recently, you will note several things, its hard to make decisions with ear infection in kids or achieve lasting ear pain relief. The ordinary pediatrician sees these cases daily, and they know how their treatment is likely to end up. Typically they prescribe antibiotics, which will work temporarily, but very often the ear infection returns or goes to the other side, or both. After several rounds of antibiotics (I once had a patient who had been on over 20 rounds of antibiotics before the age of 2, not prescribed by me) they will recommend adenoid or tonsil removal and/or tubes to externally drain the ear (this has a whole host of other problems that are often failed to be disclosed until after the surgeries). A NATURAL REMEDY OF EAR INFECTIONS The problem with ordinary care by a pediatrician or a medical doctor is that they typically fail to identify first the cause of the infection or dysfunction (viral, bacterial, or inflammatory). Medical journals now clearly state that antibiotics should not be the treatment for otitis media (ear infections) yet that is still what is happening clinically. A better answer is available that has helped many patients recover from the cycle permanently without drugs or surgery. It is based on an understanding that blocked Eustachian tubes which don't drain properly will always cause problems. Children are more prone to this because they have shallower Eustachian tubes that are more likely to stop flowing. As their skulls grow the tubes get steeper and drain easier finally producing ear pain relief. When we understand this, we can start to look at the relationship of all the structures which affect Eustachian tube drainage, including alignment of the physical structures of the head and neck. CHIROPRACTIC IS THE NUMBER ONE NATURAL REMEDY FOR EAR INFECTIONS There are many natural remedies for Ear Infection out there, and they are often tried in succession after conventional medicine has failed to stop the cycle of ear infections and antibiotics and surgeries. Most focus on immune function or the infection itself, a few focus on structural changes, and chiropractic actually affects both. The most important change that needs to occur in frequent ear infections is proper Eustachian tube drainage, which can be performed by gentle adjustments to the skull and upper neck. This can also have a profound effect on immune function, which is a secondary problem of otitis media (ear infections).
