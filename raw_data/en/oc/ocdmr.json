Copyright \u00a9 2007 Massachusetts Medical Society.A BS TR AC T Background A phase 3 trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a prophylactic quadrivalent vaccine in preventing anogenital diseases associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, and 18. Methods In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial involving 5455 women be - tween the ages of 16 and 24 years, we assigned 2723 women to receive vaccine and 2732 to receive placebo at day 1, month 2, and month 6. The coprimary composite end points were the incidence of genital warts, vulvar or vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia, or cancer and the incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, adeno - carcinoma in situ, or cancer associated with HPV type 6, 11, 16, or 18. Data for the primary analysis were collected for a per-protocol susceptible population of women who had no virologic evidence of HPV type 6, 11, 16, or 18 through 1 month after administration of the third dose. Results The women were followed for an average of 3 years after administration of the first dose. In the per-protocol population, those followed for vulvar, vaginal, or perianal disease included 2261 women (83%) in the vaccine group and 2279 (83%) in the pla - cebo group. Those followed for cervical disease included 2241 women (82%) in the vaccine group and 2258 (83%) in the placebo group. Vaccine efficacy was 100% for each of the coprimary end points. In an intention-to-treat analysis, including those with prevalent infection or disease caused by vaccine-type and non-vaccine-type HPV, vaccination reduced the rate of any vulvar or vaginal perianal lesions regard - less of the causal HPV type by 34% (95% confidence interval [CI], 15 to 49), and the rate of cervical lesions regardless of the causal HPV type by 20% (95% CI, 8 to 31). Conclusions The quadrivalent vaccine significantly reduced the incidence of HPV-associated anogenital diseases in young women.

Quadrivalent HPV Vaccine to Prevent anogenital Diseases n engl j med 356;19 www.nejm.org may 10, 2007 1929A nogenital infection with the hu - man papillomavirus (HPV) can cause warts, intraepithelial neoplasia, and invasive can - cers.1-6 The majority of HPV-associated diseases are caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18. HPV types 6 (HPV-6) and 11 (HPV-11) cause most ano - genital warts, a portion of the cases of low-grade neoplasia,5,7-10 and recurrent respiratory papillo- matosis, a rare but potentially life-threatening disease.11-13 HPV type 16 (HPV-16) is the most common cause of invasive cancers of the cervix and other anogenital cancers associated with HPV.4,6,14-19 HPV type 18 (HPV-18), the second most common cause of cervical cancer, is detected even more frequently in adenocarcinoma, the in - cidence of which is increasing.18,20,21 The precur - sor lesion of adenocarcinoma is difficult to detect on routine Papanicolaou testing or colposcopy.21,22 A phase 3 trial of the efficacy and safety of a quad - rivalent HPV vaccine (targeting HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, and HPV-18) was designed to include an intensive schedule of visits and aggressive regi - mens to identify cases of genital disease associ - ated with HPV in the study population. Me thods Study Design The Females United to Unilaterally Reduce Endo/ Ectocervical Disease (FUTURE) I study is an on - going, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ran - domized trial sponsored by Merck; the study was designed and managed and the results were analyzed by the sponsor in conjunction with ex - ternal academic investigators and an external data and safety monitoring board. From January 2002 through March 2003, 6463 women underwent screening for eligibility; of these, we enrolled a total of 5455 (84%) subjects between the ages of 16 and 24 years at 62 study sites in 16 countries. The institutional review board at each site ap - proved the protocol. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject. The study popu - lation was drawn primarily from communities near universities. Healthy women who were not preg - nant and had no history of genital warts or abnor - mal results on cervical cytologic testing and had a lifetime number of no more than four sex part - ners were eligible. The women were required to use effective contraception during the vaccination period (day 1 through month 7) of the study. The sponsor collated the data and monitored the conduct of the study. The cutoff date for this manuscript was June 15, 2006. The sponsor and the academic authors proposed the statistical analyses, which were performed by the sponsor. All authors had full access to these analyses and approved the final manuscript. The manuscript was drafted by employees of the sponsor in col - laboration with academic authors. All authors vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data presented. Vaccine and Randomization The quadrivalent HPV-6/11/16/18 L1 virus-like- particle vaccine with amorphous aluminum hy - droxyphosphate sulfate (Gardasil, Merck) as an adjuvant and the aluminum-containing placebo were visually indistinguishable and have been de - scribed elsewhere.23 A description of the random - ization procedure used in the trial can be found in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org. Vaccine or placebo was administered after a negative re - sult on a pregnancy test of the urine or blood. The women were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination. Each woman recorded oral tempera - tures on a vaccination report card 4 hours after receiving the injection and once daily for the next 4 days. Adverse events were recorded with the use of the vaccination report cards for 15 days after vaccination, as were all serious adverse events potentially related to the procedure or vaccine, deaths, and pregnancy outcomes throughout the trial. Follow-up At day 1 (the day of the first injection of vaccine or placebo), month 7 (1 month after administra - tion of the third dose), and months 12, 24, 36, and 48, the women underwent a gynecologic exami - nation. At day 1, month 3 (1 month after admin - istration of the second dose), and months 7, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, and 48, they underwent a comprehen - sive anogenital examination at which an endocer - vical and ectocervical swab specimen (considered to be one specimen), a combined labial-vulvar- perineal swab specimen, and a perianal swab specimen (pooled as one specimen) were collect - ed. For a description of the anti-HPV testing and HPV DNA testing, see the Supplementary Appen - dix. At day 1 and months 7, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, and 48, cervical samples for Papanicolaou cyto - logic testing (ThinPrep, Cytyc) were collected.

Overt lesions were photographed. Biopsy specimens of lesions considered to be clinically associated with HPV or of unknown cause were obtained. Repeated bi - opsy of recurrent external anogenital or vaginal lesions was not performed. The treatment of le - sions was based on local standards of care. Cer - vical cytologic specimens were classified accord - ing to the Bethesda system (2001) and read at a central laboratory (Diagnostic Cytology Labora - tories).24 For the criteria for referral for colpos - copy, see the Supplementary Appendix. All biopsy specimens were processed independently to avoid contamination of HPV DNA and were read in a blinded fashion first for clinical management by pathologists at the central laboratory, then for end-point adjudication by a panel of four gyneco - logic pathologists, as described in the report by the FUTURE II study group elsewhere in this is - sue of the Journal .25 Case Definition and Primary Hypotheses There were two efficacy hypotheses. The first stated that, as compared with placebo, the quad - rivalent vaccine reduces the combined incidence of anogenital warts, vulvar or vaginal intraepi - thelial neoplasia grades 1 to 3, or cancer associ - ated with vaccine-type HPV; the second stated that, as compared with placebo, the quadrivalent vac - cine reduces the combined incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 1 to 3, adeno - carcinoma in situ, or cancer associated with vac - cine-type HPV. A case was defined as a consensus diagnosis by the pathology panel of one of these end-point events, with vaccine-type HPV DNA de - tected in an adjacent histologic section of the same biopsy specimen (Fig. 1 in the Supplemen - tary Appendix). The subject and the investigator were informed of the need for further treatment if the panel rendered a more clinically significant diagnosis. Clinical impressions were recorded but were not used to determine an end point in the efficacy analysis. Statistical Analysis A fixed-event design was used for the statistical analysis. At least 38 cases of external anogenital or vaginal lesions associated with vaccine-type HPV and at least 38 cases of cervical lesions associated with vaccine-type HPV were required for the study to have 91% power to declare the vaccine effica - cious against at least one of the primary compos - ite end points with a one-sided alpha level of sig - nificance of 0.0125 (incorporating multiplicity adjustment), assuming a true vaccine efficacy of at least 80%. To reach the requisite numbers of each of the end points by month 36 in the primary analysis population, and an assumed event rate of 1% per year for each of the coprimary end points, approximately 5400 participants were re - quired. An analysis was conducted when 38 exter - nal anogenital and vaginal end-point events and 37 cervical end-point events had occurred (at ap - proximately 1.5 years of follow-up after adminis - tration of the third dose, and including all data from visits occurring on or before July 15, 2005). This analysis was included in the application for vaccine licensure, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration on June 8, 2006. The ef - ficacy and safety analyses presented here include an additional year of follow-up from this ongoing study and data from visits that occurred on or be - fore June 15, 2006. For each of the primary composite end points, the primary efficacy analysis (Fig. 1) was con - ducted in the HPV-type-specific per-protocol sus - ceptible populations, defined as subjects who were negative on polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) analy - sis and serologic testing for the relevant vaccine- type HPV at enrollment, remained negative for the same vaccine-type HPV through 1 month after administration of the third dose of vaccine or placebo, received three doses of vaccine or place - bo within 1 year, and did not have protocol vio - lations. Follow-up for case ascertainment started 1 month after administration of the third dose. An exact conditional procedure was used to evaluate vaccine efficacy, assuming that the numbers of cases in the vaccine group and the placebo group were independent Poisson ran - dom variables.26 A point estimate of vaccine ef - ficacy and the 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated on the b asis of the observed split in cases between the vaccine and placebo recipients and the accrued person-time. For subjects who had more than one end-point event, only the first event in a category was counted as a case (defined as a consensus diagnosis), but a subject with more than one end-point event could be counted in more than one category of end-point events.

Quadrivalent HPV Vaccine to Prevent anogenital Diseases n engl j med 356;19 www.nejm.org may 10, 2007 1931The analyses were performed with respect to the primary composite end points and were fur - ther characterized according to type of lesion and vaccine-type HPV. A woman who had a single le - sion containing more than one vaccine-type HPV or multiple lesions of different histologic grades was counted once toward the composite end points and once toward the type-specific and lesion-spe - cific end points. For example, for a woman found by consensus diagnosis to have a cervical intraepi - thelial neoplasia grade 2 lesion associated with HPV-16 at month 12, this end-point event would be counted as a case at month 12. Subsequently, the same subject may have been diagnosed with an HPV-16-associated cervical intraepithelial neo - plasia grade 3 lesion and an HPV-18-associated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 lesion at month 19. Overall, on the basis of these con - sensus diagnoses, this subject would be counted once toward the primary composite end point, once toward HPV-16-associated end points, once toward HPV-18-associated end points, once to - ward cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2, and once toward cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3. A description of the two additional populations that were included in the prespecified analyses supportive of the primary analysis is shown in Figure 1. Vaccine efficacy was estimated in an un - restricted susceptible population that included all women who were negative on PCR analysis and serologic testing for the relevant vaccine-type HPV at enrollment. We also estimated vaccine efficacy in an intention-to-treat population that included all subjects who had undergone randomization, regardless of their baseline HPV status or evidence of HPV-associated anogenital disease. Follow-up for end-point ascertainment in these two addi - tional populations started after day 1. The analy - ses in the intention-to-treat population evaluated vaccine efficacy against diseases associated with vaccine-type HPV and the overall effect of vac - cination on the number of cases of prevalent and incident disease (caused by vaccine-type HPV or other HPV types). For the intention-to-treat analy - sis, the cumulative incidence distribution27 was computed for subjects in the vaccine and placebo groups for whom follow-up data were available and was presented graphically for the composite end points, with 95% CIs calculated at 6-month intervals.

These sub - jects were members of the per-protocol popula - tion from whom serum samples had been col - lected during predefined periods. Adverse events were summarized as frequencies and percentages according to study group and the type of adverse event reported at all visits for the administration of a dose of vaccine or placebo. Risk differences and the associated 95% CIs were calculated by comparing the vaccine and placebo groups for all vaccination visits. A 95% CI (unad - justed for multiplicity testing) that does not in - clude 0 indicates a nominally significant difference at an alpha level of 0.05 (two-sided). R esult s From January 2002 through March 2003, a total of 6463 women between the ages of 16 and 24 years were screened for eligibility at 62 study sites in the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, and North, Cen - tral, and South America. Of these women, 5455 met the inclusion criteria, and 2723 women were randomly assigned to receive quadrivalent vaccine and 2732 were assigned to receive placebo. Only a small percentage (8 of 5388 subjects [0.15%]) had serologic evidence or HPV DNA evidence of infec - tion with all the HPV types covered by the quad - rivalent vaccine ( Table 1 ). The two study groups were well balanced with regard to baseline char - acteristics and were also similar in the numbers of subjects excluded from the populations ana - lyzed. Subjects in whom vaccine-type HPV was de - tected at baseline were excluded from the analy - ses for prophylactic efficacy ( Table 2 ). Subjects in this ongoing trial were followed for an average of 3 years after administration of the first dose of vaccine or placebo. At least 83% of those who underwent randomization were includ - ed in one or more of the type-specific, per-proto - col susceptible populations for external anogeni - tal or vaginal lesions (2261 subjects in the vaccine group and 2279 in the placebo group). The HPV vaccine was 100% effective (95% CI, 94 to 100; 0 cases in the vaccine group vs. 60 cases in the placebo group) in preventing vaginal, vulvar, peri - neal, and perianal intraepithelial lesions or warts in association with vaccine-type HPV. In the type- specific, per-protocol susceptible populations, in the analysis for cervical end points, among 2241 subjects in the vaccine group and 2258 in the placebo group, the vaccine was 100% effective (95% CI, 94 to 100; 0 vs. 65 cases, respectively) in preventing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grades 1 to 3 or adenocarcinoma in situ in asso - ciation with vaccine-type HPV ( Table 3 ). The es - timates of vaccine efficacy made on the basis of the diagnoses at the central laboratory were simi - lar to the estimates made by the pathology panel (data not shown). More than 95% of the subjects who underwent randomization were included in one or more of the type-specific, unrestricted susceptible popu - lations. The vaccine efficacy was 95% when all grades of external anogenital or vaginal lesions were combined (4 cases in the vaccine group vs. 81 cases in the placebo group), 98% when all grades of cervical lesions were combined (2 vs. 89 cases, respectively), with an efficacy of 91% for high-grade vulvar or vaginal lesions (1 vs. 11 cases, respectively), and 100% for adenocarcino - ma in situ (0 vs. 6 cases, respectively) ( Table 3 ). Overall, more than 95% of the subjects received the complete regimen of three doses of vaccine or placebo. Because the public health benefit of a safe and effective HPV vaccine will be measured by its effect in all vaccinated women, we estimated vaccine efficacy in an intention-to-treat popula - tion, regardless of the baseline HPV status of the subjects included in the analysis ( Table 3 ). The analysis included women with prevalent infec - tions with vaccine-type HPV or diseases associ - with The efficacy against vaccine-type HPV was 73% (95% CI, 58 to 83) when all grades of external anogenital or vaginal lesions were combined (28 cases in the vaccine group vs. 102 cases in the placebo group) and 55% (95% CI, 40 to 66) when all grades of cervi - cal lesions were combined (71 vs. 155 cases, re - spectively) ( Table 3 ). In the intention-to-treat popu - lation, in the placebo group, the incidence of external anogenital or cervical disease associated with vaccine-type HPV continued to increase over time, whereas in the vaccine group the incidence began to plateau (Fig. 2). There was no clear evi - dence that vaccination altered the course of dis - ease or infection present before administration of the first dose ( Table 2 in the Supplementary Ap - pendix). No cancers associated with any vaccine- type HPV were identified.

Erythema, pru - ritus, and swelling at the injection site were also more common among vaccine recipients than among placebo recipients ( Table 4 ). With respect to systemic adverse events, a nominally higher proportion of vaccine recipients (13.3%), as com - pared with placebo recipients (10.3%), reported fever between 100\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C) and 102\u00b0F (38.9\u00b0C) (risk difference, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.3 to 4.8) ( Table 4 ). Similar proportions of vaccine and placebo recipi - ents reported a serious adverse event. All systemic and serious adverse events, categorized according to organ system and treatment group, are shown in Tables 3 and 4 in the Supplementary Appendix. Among the subjects who were seropositive for one or more of the four HPV types at day 1, the profile of adverse events was similar to that of the entire study cohort. For example, of 529 vac - cine recipients, 452 (85%) reported one or more injection-site adverse events, as compared with 388 of 507 placebo recipients (77%), with injec -tion-site pain reported as the most frequent ad - verse event in 84% of the vaccine recipients and 74% of the placebo recipients (risk difference, 10.1; 95% CI, 5.2 to 15.1) ( Table 4 ). One subject in this subgroup had a serious vaccine-related adverse event (bronchospasm 1 day after receipt of the third dose). No multiplicity adjustments were made for these comparisons. For a summary of the pregnancy outcomes in the combined phase 3 quadrivalent vaccine studies, see the report by the FUTURE II study group (and Tables 2, 3, and 4 in that article's Supplementary Appendix).25 Discussion These results of the FUTURE I study show that a prophylactic quadrivalent HPV vaccine is highly effective in preventing clinical disease, including anogenital warts and intraepithelial neoplasia of the cervix, associated with HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, and HPV-18.

The per-protocol susceptible population was defined as subjects who were negative on PCR analysis and serologic testing for the relevant HPV type at enrollment, remained negative on PCR analysis for the same HPV type through 1 month after administration of the third dose of vaccine or placebo, received three doses of vaccine or placebo within 1 year, and did not have protocol violations. The unrestricted susceptible population was defined as subjects who did not test positive for the relevant HPV type at enrollment. \u00a7 The intention-to-treat population was defined as subjects who underwent randomization, including those with prevalent anogenital disease or infections caused by any high- or low-risk HPV type before the administration of vaccine or placebo. \u00b6 Subjects may have been excluded for more than one reason. This reason for exclusion applies only to the populations included in the analysis for the respective HPV type. For day 1, the analysis includes a positive result on either serologic testing or PCR. Through month 7, the analysis includes a positive result only on PCR. ** Blood samples obtained more than 14 days before administration of the first dose of vaccine or placebo were considered to be unacceptable. Swab specimens obtained more than 14 days before or 10 days after administration of the first dose of vaccine or placebo were considered to be unacceptable. The most common general protocol violations were collection of a specimen or sample at month 7 beyond the acceptable range (147 sub - jects) and receipt of nonstudy vaccine (72 subjects). \u00a7\u00a7 The month 3 visit was defined as the visit 1 month after administration of the second dose of vaccine or placebo. \u00b6\u00b6 The month 7 visit was defined as the visit 1 month after administration of the third dose of vaccine or placebo.

Among the 65 subjects in the placebo group with end-point events (cases, defined by consensus diagnosis) of cervical lesions associated with vaccine-type HPV presented according to the severity of the histologic findings, 33 subjects with CIN had grade 1 lesions, 13 had grade 2 lesions, 13 had grade 3 lesions, and 6 subjects had adenocarcinoma in situ. \u00a7 The unrestricted susceptible population included subjects who did not test positive for the relevant HPV type at enrollment. \u00b6 Of subjects in the unrestricted susceptible population who received at least one dose of vaccine or placebo and had at least one follow-up visit after administration of the first dose, 2621 in the vaccine group and 2629 in the placebo group were included in the analysis for end points associated with vaccine-type HPV: 2335 and 2353, respectively, were included in the analysis for end points associated with HPV-6 and HPV-11; 2216 and 2216, respectively, in the analysis for end points associated with HPV-16; and 2481 and 2503, respectively, in the analysis for end points associated with HPV-18. Of subjects in the unrestricted susceptible population who received at least one dose of vaccine or placebo and had at least one follow-up visit after administration of the first dose, 2559 in the vaccine group and 2576 in the placebo group were included in the analysis for end points associated with vaccine-type HPV: 2282 and 2307, respectively, in the analysis for end points associated with HPV-6 and HPV-11; 2159 and 2173, respectively, in the analysis for end points associated with HPV-16; and 2425 and 2452, respectively, in the analysis for end points associated with HPV-18. ** One subject in the vaccine group received three doses of placebo in error. Among the 89 subjects in the placebo group with end-point events (cases, defined as consensus diagnosis) of cervical lesions associated with vaccine-type HPV presented according to the severity of the histologic findings, 46 subjects with CIN had grade 1 lesions, 17 had grade 2 lesions, 20 had grade 3 lesions, and 6 subjects had adenocarcinoma in situ.

Perineal cancer developed in one subject who received three doses of the quadrivalent vaccine. At day 1, she was negative on PCR analysis and serologic testing for all vaccine-type HPV, negative on PCR analysis for seven other oncogenic HPV types, and negative on Papanicolaou testing. At the scheduled month 24 visit, she was noted to have a perineal lesion. On biopsy 1 month later, the lesion was found to be a well-differentiated squamous-cell carcinoma; PCR analysis of paraffin-embedded specimens was vaccine-type HPV and for 10 other oncogenic HPV types. She was negative on Papanicolaou testing at all scheduled visits (months 7, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36). Cervicovaginal swabs collected during these visits were negative for HPV, except at month 24, when an external genital swab sample (of the labial-vulvar-perineal and perianal regions) was positive for HPV-16 and HPV-59. Although the external genital swab sample collected at month 24 was positive for HPV-16 and HPV-59, PCR analysis of paraffin-embedded specimens was negative for all HPV types tested (vaccine-type HPV and other types).

There were relatively few adverse events among the vaccine recipients. Several steps were taken to ensure that this study would provide a high level of confidence in the safety and efficacy of the quadrivalent vac - cine. A diverse population of young women par - ticipating in developed and developing countries were enrolled. Data on serious vaccine-related or procedure-related adverse events and pregnancy outcomes were collected for the entire follow-up period. Since HPV-associated vaginal and vulvar lesions may have an ambiguous clinical presenta - tion, an intensive visit schedule with aggressive regimens for genital inspection, biopsy of suspect lesions and cytologic screening, and colposcopy with biopsy were used to ensure a high sensitivity for HPV-associated lesions. High diagnostic accu - racy for end-point determinations was provided by a panel of expert pathologists who were unaware of the treatment assignments. Estimates of vac - cine efficacy were high whether the diagnoses were made by the pathology panel or by the cen - tral laboratory, indicating robust efficacy mea - surements. When we evaluated the quadrivalent vaccine's effectiveness against disease associated with the HPV types covered by the vaccine in the intention- to-treat population (as compared with the un - restricted susceptible population), all additional cases detected in the vaccine group occurred in subjects who were infected with vaccine-type HPV before vaccination. Among all randomized subjects with an end-point event within the first year of follow-up, both the vaccine group (57 [97%] cases of disease in 59 subjects) and the placebo group (59 [81%] cases of disease in 73 subjects) had evidence of infection or disease that was prevalent at enrollment. During the second year of follow-up, the incidence of disease asso - ciated with vaccine-type HPV in the placebo group Table 4.

Quadrivalent HPV Vaccine to Prevent anogenital Diseases n engl j med 356;19 www.nejm.org may 10, 2007 1941continued to increase, whereas in the vaccine group the incidence appeared to reach a plateau, as cases of disease due to prevalent infection were no longer detected and vaccine appeared to reduce the incidence of new infections and associated disease. A decrease (unadjusted for multiplicity) in over - all rates of anogenital disease, regardless of causal HPV type, was also observed. The develop - ment of vulvar cancer, though rare, in one sub - ject in the vaccine group highlights the importance of continued screening. Since vaccinated women remain at risk for cervical and genital disease re - sulting from infections with vaccine-type HPV that might be present at the time of vaccination and from newly acquired infections with HPV types that are not targeted by the quadrivalent HPV vac -cine, such women should continue to undergo regular cervical screening for cancer and genital examination, as clinically indicated. A limitation of our study is the lack of long- term follow-up. The duration of the efficacy of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine and whether boost - ers are needed are not known. Similarly, to date, no minimum protective anti-HPV antibody titers have been identified. A phase 2 trial of the quad - rivalent vaccine showed that at 5 years the vac - cine is highly efficacious against infection and disease associated with vaccine-type HPV and that vaccine-induced anti-HPV antibody levels are main - tained at or above the levels observed in natural infection.28,29 At 5 years in this phase 2 study, an antigen challenge resulted in strong anamnestic responses, with sharp rises in antibody titer, in -Table 4.

Injection-site adverse events included were reported during the first 5 days after vaccination. Systemic adverse events included were reported during the first 15 days after vaccination. All other adverse events reflect the entire follow-up period as of June 15, 2006. The risk difference is the value for the HPV vaccine minus the value for placebo. The 95% CIs that do not include 0 indicate a statistically significant difference at an alpha level of 0.05 (two-sided). No multiplicity adjustments were made for these comparisons. This event was considered to be possibly, probably, or definitely injection-related. \u00a7 There were two deaths in the vaccine group, one as a result of a car accident 342 days after administration of the third dose, and one by suicide 1373 days after enrollment. There were two deaths in the placebo group, one from deep-vein thrombosis, renal insufficiency, and shock to the lung 204 days after administration of the third dose, and one as a result of a traffic accident 1 day after administration of the second dose. None of these deaths were considered by the investigator to be related to the vaccine or placebo.

As in other trials of prophylactic vaccines,30 our primary analysis focused on women who at baseline were not infected with vaccine-type HPV. Under conditions that may reflect deviations in vaccine dosing intervals, such as in the unrestrict - ed susceptible population, the efficacy against these HPV types remained high \u2014 95% for ex - ternal anogenital or vaginal lesions and 98% for cervical lesions. These data also suggest that there is some flexibility in the timing of the vaccina - tion regimen. Adolescent men and women mount higher antibody responses to the quadrivalent vaccine31 than do young adult women, but wheth - er the quadrivalent HPV vaccine will prevent geni - tal infection and lesions in men is unknown. Our data demonstrate the efficacy of a pro - phylactic quadrivalent HPV vaccine against lesions caused by all the targeted types of HPV. There was also a reduction in the overall incidence of ano - genital lesions in the vaccine group. Widespread vaccination of young women and adolescent girls should reduce the incidence of cervical and ex - ternal anogenital disease associated with HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, and HPV-18. Further research is needed to evaluate the effect of large-scale vac - cination programs on the overall burden of HPV disease.
