Here's what to you need to know.", "sitename": "Grove Collaborative", "date": "2022-08-25", "cleaned_text": "Long before natural cleaning products became a thing, most people cleaned with whatever the big chemical companies offered. It didn't occur to the general public that the chemicals in household cleaners might not be all that great for them \u2014 or the environment. Nowadays, we know better. Decades of research have produced a large body of evidence showing the potentially harmful effects of a long list of cleaning chemicals. We're exposed to them both through our skin and the air when we do the dishes or scrub the tub. And the environment fares even worse, with many chemicals (not to mention most products' plastic packaging) finding their way into our oceans and waterways. While most of us may have wised up to the fact that those chemicals that scour our toilets or eat away tough stains probably aren't, well, all that great for us or our surroundings, misconceptions around natural alternatives still persist. They don't work as well, or they won't leave my house smelling as fresh. It's time to kick those outdated thoughts to the curb! If you've been dragging your feet on making the switch, our guide is here to make the process easy, effective, and fun \u2014 or as fun as cleaning can be. "}
