However, three coronaviruses have caused more serious human disease. One causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); another causes Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS); and the third causes COVID-19. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called SARS-CoV-2. Some people have sought \"alternative\" remedies to prevent or to treat COVID-19. Some of these purported remedies include teas, essential oils, tinctures, herbal therapies such as oleander/oleandrin, and silver products such as [colloidal silver]. The Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has detailed fact sheets for consumers (in [English](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/DietarySupplementsInTheTimeOfCOVID19-Consumer/) and [Spanish](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/COVID19-DatosEnEspanol/)) and [health professionals](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/COVID19-HealthProfessional/) about specific dietary supplements and COVID-19. But there is no scientific evidence that any of these alternative remedies can prevent or cure COVID-19. In fact, some of them may not be safe to consume. It's important to understand that although many herbal or [dietary supplements] (and some prescription drugs) come from natural sources, \"natural\" does not always mean that a product is a safer or better option for your health.

If you are worried about your symptoms, the [Coronavirus Self-Checker](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) can assist in the decision to seek care. COVID-19 vaccination helps protect people from getting sick or severely ill with COVID-19, but some people who are fully vaccinated still get COVID-19, and some have been hospitalized with COVID-19. The [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html) (CDC) and the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines) (FDA) have information on the vaccines that are approved and authorized in the United States to prevent COVID-19. Visit the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html) for more information on vaccination and other steps you can take to protect yourself and others from COVID-19. For people who are [more likely to get very sick](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/understanding-risk.html) from COVID-19 infection, [treatments are available](https://aspr.hhs.gov/COVID-19/Treatments/Pages/default.aspx) that can reduce the chances of being hospitalized or dying from the disease. Medications to treat COVID-19 must be prescribed by a health care provider and started as soon as possible after diagnosis to be effective. For people at high risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, contact a health care provider right away to determine if you are eligible for treatment, even if your symptoms are mild. Researchers are studying additional drugs as possible treatments for COVID-19. [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/activ/covid-19-therapeutics-prioritized-testing-clinical-trials#activ1) is supporting many [clinical trials] to test possible treatments. The FDA has also authorized emergency use of a preventive medicine to help prevent COVID-19 infection in certain adults and children 12 years of age and older (such as those who are severely immunocompromised or allergic to COVID-19 vaccines).
