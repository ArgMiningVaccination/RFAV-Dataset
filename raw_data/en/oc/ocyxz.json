The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention is a component of the Office of Justice Programs, which also includes the Bureau of Justice Assistance; the Bureau of Justice Statistics; the Community Capacity Development Office; the National Institute of Justice; the Office for Victims of Crime; and the Office of Sex Offender Sentencing, Monitoring, Apprehending, Registering, and Tracking (SMART). The 2008 Annual Report highlights the important work carried out by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention's (OJJDP's) dedicated men and women in partnership with States, localities, and talented individuals across our country. As I end my tenure, I am pleased to be able to report success in difficult areas such as reducing youth gang activity, improving child safety, developing new tools to enable States to significantly reduce dispro\u00adportionate minority contact, and increased partnerships and collaboration between Federal agencies in addressing the needs of youth. fOreWOrd Across the Federal Government, hundreds of billions of dollars are committed to support dis\u00ad advantaged children and families. The share of those funds focused on juvenile justice, how\u00adever, remains limited. Achieving the success that all of us desire will require increased part\u00adnership and a growing awareness that those who care for children must address \"precursor\" issues\u2014education, family strength, health, hunger, and community safety. For that reason, in fiscal year (FY) 2008, I continued to work through the Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to share funding, support cross-agency efforts, and keep pre\u00advention as a high priority. We have developed many effective tools and strategies to address juvenile delinquency\u2014from the highly functioning Council to the SMART geospatial mapping tool, a Web-accessible application that communities can use to position local resources to help prevent crime and delinquency. OJJDP also has created the Model Programs Guide, which provides proven strategies for addressing a range of juvenile justice issues. These and other resources described throughout this Report will provide strong support for OJJDP's ongoing mission and new initiatives in FY 2009 and beyond. This Report describes the important work of faith-based and small community organizations on everything from mentoring youth in detention to helping gang-involved youth. Their work demonstrates the power we can harness from people who live and work in the communities where the needs are greatest. We need every hand at the tasks before us, and this work demon\u00adstrates that these partners can provide invaluable assistance, which should be continued in the years to come. While challenges lie ahead, we can and should recognize where we have succeeded, and work to expand and export those programs and practices that have shown positive outcomes. At the same time, we must also be willing to abandon those efforts that are not successful and harm the youth we seek to save. Therefore, OJJDP has continued to evaluate programs and initia\u00ad tives and has not devoted any discretionary funds to boot camps or programs that fail to yield positive results year after year. Our strong record in FY 2008 reflects the commitment of dedicated professionals, generous volunteers, and caring families across the country. We dedicate this Report to them, and look forward to continued progress in addressing the needs of America's children. J. Robert Flores Administrator Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention abOut OJJdP the Office of Juvenile Justice and delinquency Prevention (OJJdP) was established by congress through the Juvenile Justice and delinquency Prevention (JJdP) act of 1974, Public law 93-415, as amended. a component of the Office of Justice Programs within the u.s. department of Justice, OJJdP works to prevent and control juvenile delinquency, improve the juvenile justice system, and protect children. Mission Statement OJJdP provides national leadership, coordination, and the resources to prevent and respond to juvenile delinquency and victimization. OJJdP supports states and communities in their efforts to develop and implement effective and coordinated prevention and intervention programs and to improve the juvenile justice system so that it protects public safety, holds offenders accountable, and provides treatment and rehabilitative services tailored to the needs of juveniles and their families.

At the same time, they have many opportunities not available to earlier generations. One of the principal responsibilities of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) is to help ensure that those opportunities remain available and continue to grow to meet the ever-changing needs of the country's young people. During fiscal year (FY) 2008, the guiding philosophy behind OJJDP's programs was to fund activities and programs that improve outcomes for the Nation's youth. This meant supporting programs that reduce juvenile delinquency and crime, protecting children from sexual exploita\u00adtion and abuse, and improving the juvenile justice system so that it protects public safety, holds offenders accountable, and provides services\u2014tailored to individual and community needs\u2014to juvenile victims and offenders and to their families. The Office's many accomplishments in FY 2008 ranged from helping the field understand emerging issues such as female offending, to using technology to help communities develop comprehensive responses to juvenile delinquency, to working with faith-based organizations. OFFICE OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION 3 2008 ANNUAL REPORT The Office also continued to represent the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) on Helping Amer\u00ad ica's Youth, an initiative led by First Lady Laura Bush. OJJDP's many efforts on this initiative included helping to identify successful programs for Mrs. Bush to visit as she traveled the coun\u00adtry speaking about the needs of America's youth. OJJDP is also especially proud of the role it has played in two major DOJ initiatives: Project Safe Childhood and the Comprehensive Anti-Gang Initiative. OJJDP recognizes that much remains to be done to prevent, intervene in, and treat delinquent behavior. The activities highlighted throughout this Report illustrate OJJDP's commitment to continually strive to improve outcomes for the Nation's children, particularly those at risk, by supporting programs that have the greatest potential for improving the juvenile justice system and keeping communities safe. When adults offer young people a chance, their love and support can show struggling youth the hope that lies beyond their future, and sometimes that hope makes all the difference. \u2014First Lady Laura Bush, leader of the Helping America's Youth Initiative OFFICE OF JUVENILE 4 Girls Study Group In the 1990s, a surge of girls' arrests brought female juvenile crime to the country's attention. Girls' rates of arrest for some crimes increased faster than boys' rates of arrest. By 2004, girls accounted for 30 per\u00ad cent of all juvenile arrests, but delinquency experts did not know whether these trends reflected changes in girls' behavior or changes in arrest patterns. The juvenile justice field struggled to understand how best to respond to the needs of the girls entering the system. In 2004, OJJDP convened the Girls Study Group (GSG) to establish a research\u00adbased foundation to guide the development, testing, and dissemination of strategies to reduce or prevent girls' involvement in delinquency and violence. FY 2008 saw the beginning of OJJDP's dissemination of the GSG's findings. The study group sponsored a 1\u00adday preconference ses\u00ad sion at the March 2008 Blueprints Conference in Denver, CO. The focus of the preconference session was to convey findings and discuss the evidence base for girls' programming and needs. In addition, GSG members presented some of the group's findings to the Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention in June 2008. OJJDP launched a Girls' Delinquency Web page and is producing a series of bulletins that present the study group's findings on such issues as patterns of offending among adolescents and how they differ for girls and boys; risk and protective factors associated with delinquency, including gender differences; and the causes and correlates of girls' delinquency. Detailed information about the new GSG Bulletins and the Girls' Delinquency Web page may be found in chap\u00adter 5. Online Resources The Girls' Delinquency Web page may be accessed at www.ojjdp.ncjrs.gov/programs/ girlsdelinquency.html. Detailed information about GSG can be found at the Girls Study Group Web site at www.girlsstudygroup.rti.org. Information about the preconference session on girls' delinquency at the March 2008 Blueprints Conference in Denver, CO, is available at www.blueprintsconference.com/girls_study_group.html. Electronic Mapping\u2014the SMART System OJJDP's Socioeconomic Mapping and Resource Topography (SMART) system is a free, Web\u00adaccessible application that communities can use to position local resources to help prevent crime and delinquency. Users can connect SMART maps of crime locations with maps of local intervention programs and com\u00admunity resources. The system contains crime data, census data, and locations of community resources, including YMCAs, Boys & Girls Clubs, and police JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION CHAPTER 1 stations. SMART has been available to the public since September 2006 and pro\u00ad vides information about all of OJJDP's active grants across the country. In FY 2008, OJJDP expanded the data and information that is available in SMART and has greatly enhanced the functionality of the application. Some examples of this include the location and contact information for public schools nationwide (from the National Center for Education Statistics), the location and contact information of public juvenile residential placement facilities (from the Juvenile Residential Facility Census), the ability to upload multiple addresses from spreadsheets into the system (e.g., local crime and delinquency data and addresses of local incidents of crime), and data from the Uniform Crime Reports between 1994 and 2004. A total of 5,661 users have registered in the SMART system. Users include community organizations, law enforcement agencies, State and local agencies, members of academia, and national organizations. OJJDP introduced several enhancements to the SMART system in FY 2008 that improve the visual display of information on the mapping page and allow the user greater flexibility in how the information is presented. The improvements to the mapping page include the ability to display and print maps and reports as PDFs and to view SMART data as a scatter chart. SMART users can now customize a geographic area by selecting multiple areas of interest. A dropdown box on the Custom Area Selection map page allows the user to overlay a transparent map as a reference for creating a customized map. For example, a user can select a group of census tracts to correspond to a particular school, congressional, or police district. Service providers also can select census tracts that correspond to their particular service areas within a city. Over the past year, SMART has been highlighted at a number of major confer\u00ad ences. In particular, the Environmental Systems Research Institute's Federal User Conference in Washington, DC, and International User Conference in San Diego, CA; the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives in New York City; the International Association of Chiefs of Police in San Diego, CA; and the National Youth Gang Symposium in Atlanta, GA. Online Resource For more information about SMART, please see OJJDP's In Focus Fact Sheet, available at 5 ANNUAL REPORT www.ojjdp.ncjrs.gov/pubs/222504.pdf. SMART is free and available on the Web at http:/ / smart.gismapping.info. 2008 6 OFFICE OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION are permanent members of the group. First Lady Laura Bush speaking at the HAY conference in Dallas, TX, on November 8, 2007. Faith-Based Activities In December 2002, President Bush signed Executive Order 13279, which created the White House Office of Faith\u00adBased and Community Initiatives. This Order called for a \"comprehensive effort to enlist, equip, enable, empower, and expand the work of faith\u00adbased and other community organizations.\" As a result, Federal agencies are developing policies that remove the obstacles that make it difficult for faith\u00adbased and community organizations to compete for Federal grants and are expanding the funding opportunities that are open to these organizations. In FY 2008, OJJDP instituted a number of policies and activities to support the President's initiative. The Office worked diligently to include faith\u00adbased and community organizations in existing activities, sponsored and supported several training conferences to educate these organizations about the Federal grantmaking process, and funded a variety of programs provided by faith\u00adbased organizations to combat juvenile delinquency and improve child protection. The programs address a range of issues, including mentoring for children of incarcerated parents and commercial sexual exploitation of children. The Office's faith\u00adbased efforts are described in greater detail in chapter 2. Helping America's Youth Helping America's Youth (HAY) is a Presidential initiative led by First Lady Laura Bush to raise awareness about the chal\u00adlenges facing the Nation's youth, particularly at\u00adrisk boys, and to motivate caring adults to connect with youth in three key areas: family, school, and community. Through its collaboration with nine other Federal agencies in supporting the HAY Initiative, OJJDP helps ensure that gang prevention is a significant focus of this effort by promoting awareness of the issue at a senior level within the Administration and disseminating information to practitioners in the field. Specific accomplishments for 2008 include the following: On February 7, 2008, President Bush signed an Executive Order establishing the Interagency Working Group on Youth Programs, a coalition of Federal agencies that will support communities and organizations working on behalf of the Nation's youth. The order builds on the success of HAY. OJJDP staff As the leader of the initiative, Mrs. Bush has hosted one national conference and five regional conferences and participated in 125 other CHAPTER 1 Helping America's Youth activities in 24 States and the District of Columbia to promote the efforts of youth\u00adserving organizations. OJJDP served as the Department's liaison for the initiative. OJJDP compiled nominations for community coalitions to attend the HAY regional training conference training in February 2008 in Portland, OR. OJJDP also compiled a list of law enforcement representatives in the region to attend the conference. OJJDP funds and supports the HAY Web site, which houses the Community Guide to Helping America's Youth. The Community Guide offers neighborhoods or localities a step\u00adby\u00adstep approach for learning more about their community, including where youth\u00adrelated problems occur, which youth and families are most affected by those problems, and what local resources and assets the com\u00admunity can use to address those problems. The Guide also includes a Commu\u00ad nity Resource Inventory that localities can use to identify and track partners and programs that are already at work locally. It provides information about promis\u00ading and proven effective interventions to prevent adolescent risky behaviors and promote positive youth development. OJJDP reviewed, edited, and facilitated major enhancements to the Guide in 2008, ensuring that both the HAY Web site and the Community Guide were com\u00ad patible in design and features. OJJDP made the Guide more user\u00adfriendly by highlighting its benefits and resources more prominently. OJJDP continues to be involved in this initiative, providing resources, staff time, and expertise. Online Resource To learn more about the HAY Initiative, visit www.helpingamericasyouth.gov. Project Safe Childhood OJJDP is proud to be playing a major role in DOJ's Project Safe Childhood (PSC) initiative, which combats 7 ANNUAL REPORT Project Safe Childhood (PSC) initiative, which combats the exploitation of children by Internet predators. The project's goal is to investigate and prosecute crimes against children committed through the Internet or other electronic media and communications devices. The initiative's key partners include U.S. Attorneys; the Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) task force program, which is managed by OJJDP; the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and State and local law enforcement agencies. 2008 8 OJJDP awarded more than $17 million in grants to State and local law enforce\u00ad ment agencies under its ICAC task force program to support joint local, State, and Federal efforts to investigate and prosecute cybercrimes against children and keep children safe from Internet predators. Also in FY 2008, OJJDP took the lead in planning a month-long national media campaign as part of the PSC initiative to combat the online exploitation of chil\u00addren. The $2.5 million campaign uses a combination of public service announce\u00adments (PSAs) in English and Spanish on national cable television channels, print ads, and Internet promotions such as banner ads, pop-up ads, and Webisodes. Following a national media launch in Washington, DC, regional promotions\u2014 radio spots, movie theater PSAs, and media events\u2014were planned in four cities: Miami, FL; St. Louis, MO; Seattle, WA; and San Diego, CA. For more information on how OJJDP is working to protect children by fighting cybercrime and many other activities, see chapter 4. Comprehensive Anti-Gang Initiative OJJDP helped launch and continues to support DOJ's comprehensive initiative to combat gang violence under its Project Safe Neighborhoods. The initiative pri\u00adoritizes prevention programs to provide America's youth and offenders return\u00ading to the community with opportunities that help them resist gang involvement and ensures robust enforcement policies when gang-related violence occurs. The initiative stresses the importance of Federal and State agencies working with local partners to coordinate anti-gang strategies. The program signifi\u00ad cantly enhances resources and coordination of comprehensive communitywide responses to gangs across the country. The initiative is coordinated through the U.S. Attorneys' Offices. In June 2008, OJJDP released a publication, based on 15 years of research and practice, involving OJJDP's Comprehensive Gang Model. The document, Best Practices To Address Community Gang Problems: OJJDP's Comprehensive Gang Model, describes best practices learned from practitioners experienced in planning and implementing the model and notes findings from evaluations of programs dem\u00ad onstrating the model. OJJDP's many anti-gang activities are described in chapter 2. OFFICE OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION CHAPTER 1 Mentoring Research indicates that, when well\u00adimplemented, mentoring can be a useful strategy in working with at\u00adrisk youth and those who experience multiple risk factors for delinquency, school failure, and other negative outcomes. OJJDP's juvenile mentoring grants support national and community organizations that directly serve youth through mentoring, target specific populations of youth, and/or enhance the capacity of other organizations to recruit, train, and super\u00advise mentors. OJJDP invested more than $60 million in FY 2008 to help develop and enhance the capacity of communities to provide mentoring services to at\u00adrisk youth nationwide. The mentoring grants will focus on the needs of underserved popu\u00adlations, including at\u00adrisk youth in American Indian/Alaska Native communities and Latino communities that have gang problems. OJJDP's mentoring initiatives are described in detail in chapter 2. Enhancing Efficiency OJJDP continues to improve the effectiveness of its programs and the efficiency of its delivery of services to the field. In 2008, OJJDP expanded the field's access to performance measurement tools and took a leading role in the establishment of agencywide policies and guidance for the other program offices in establish\u00ading their own systems of performance measurement. OJJDP continued to stream\u00adline the delivery of training and technical assistance to the field. Performance Measures OJJDP made significant progress in FY 2008 in expand\u00ading, implementing, and collecting performance measures to determine the effectiveness of funded programs. The Office also enhanced its Performance Measures Web page to facilitate collecting and reporting data that measure the 9 2008 ANNUAL REPORT results of OJJDP\u00adfunded programs. The page features new to facilitate collecting and reporting data that measure the results of OJJDP\u00adfunded programs. The page features new training resources, performance\u00admeasure guidelines tai\u00ad lored to every solicitation, and centralized easy\u00adto\u00adaccess information. The newly updated page enables users to better understand performance measurement, learn about OJJDP's performance reporting requirements and resources, and access important Federal perfor\u00admance measurement resources. In addition, OJJDP provided leadership within DOJ's Office of Justice Programs (OJP) in its work to establish a stronger performance measures system through\u00adout the agency. In large part due to OJJDP's accomplishments in developing its own system, OJJDP staff provided leadership for the OJP Performance Measures Business Process Improvement Team, which was formed in March 2007. The team has completed a thorough review and analysis of the various processes related to performance measures within the different bureaus and program offices of OJP . The team's recommendations were approved by the Associate Attorney General in September 2007. During FY 2008, the team developed a performance measures catalog for use by OJP offices (to streamline the measures selection and documentation process) and crafted a set of OJP\u00adwide performance measures policies for implementation throughout the bureaus and offices of OJP , most likely in early FY 2009.

A major component of these efforts is the provision of those working to prevent and respond to juvenile delinquency and OJJDP provides national leadership, coordination, and resources to 10 OFFICE OF Training and Technical Assistance victimization. A major component of these efforts is the provision of those working to prevent and respond to juvenile delinquency and OJJDP provides national leadership, coordination, and resources to Training and Technical Assistance training and technical assistance (TTA) resources that address the needs of juvenile justice practitioners and support State and local efforts to build capacity and expand the use of evidence\u00adbased practices. OJJDP recently improved its TTA program by consolidating several training projects under one umbrella. The Office's National Training and Technical Assistance Center (NTTAC) now provides the majority of TTA to the field, covering a comprehensive range of topics\u2014from prevention to graduated sanctions to intervention to reentry. During FY 2008, NTTAC responded to a total of 155 TTA requests and pro\u00ad vided TTA to 2,935 participants. Of those requests, NTTAC supplied technical assistance to 145 requesters and 1,735 participants from 44 States, the District of Columbia, and three territories. NTTAC provided training to 1,200 participants from the 50 States and the 5 territories. JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION CHAPTER 1 Training and technical assistance covered a variety of topics, including tribal law enforcement, disproportionate minority contact (DMC), faith-based initiatives, violence prevention research, mental health in detentions and corrections, com\u00adpliance monitoring, community drug intervention, and navigating the Federal funding process. Participants included prosecutors, child protective service rep\u00adresentatives, researchers, State DMC coordinators, law enforcement personnel, judges, and treatment agency representatives. Information about specific OJJDP training and technical assistance activities is provided throughout this Report. Online Resource For more information, visit the National Training and Technical Assistance Center Web site at www.NTTAC.org. 2008 11 ANNUAL REPOR T CHAPTER 2 14 CHAPTER 2 Forming Partnerships To Prevent and Intervene in Delinquency An effective response to juvenile delinquency and violence must always involve a multi\u00ad dimensional approach that takes into account the family, school, peers, and larger com\u00admunity. Partnerships between practitioners and policymakers in many different areas of the juvenile justice field are essential. At the same time, shrinking resources necessitate coor\u00addination between agencies and organizations to ensure the efficient use of resources. For these reasons, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) has been working closely with Federal, State, local, and nonprofit partners to forge partnerships providing compre\u00adhensive and effective approaches to the problem of juvenile delinquency. These collaborations are starting to pay dividends. OJJDP helps coordinate programs at the Federal level through the Coordinating Council on Juve\u00adnile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. OJJDP has partnered with many Federal agencies to support a range of youth programs, including mentoring and other activities for at-risk youth. The Office also supports a variety of State and local collaborations. These include the Shared OFFICE OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION 15 2008 ANNUAL REPORT Youth Vision, a partnership to strengthen coordination, communication, and collaboration among youth-serving agencies; and the Federal Mentoring Council, an interagency coordinating body designed to increase the number of mentor-mentee pairs. OJJDP's partnerships are also allowing the Office to reach populations of young people who, until now, were not a primary focus of prevention efforts. One example is an effort between OJJDP and the U.S. Air Force to prevent underage drinking among those who are associated with the Air Force, either as dependents or military personnel. These and many of the other activities discussed in this chapter illustrate how OJJDP is helping community leaders, who may think they have no resources, realize they have what they need to get the job done by taking inventory of their communities, reaching out to partners, and work\u00ading alongside other sectors. With OJJDP support and guidance, these partnerships are helping to improve outcomes for youth. The hallmark of OJJDP is its ability to leverage and launch efforts to improve the lives of youth who are at risk of entering the juvenile justice system and those already within it. This could not be done without strong partnerships. . . . Through partnerships with other Federal agencies, State and local governments, and nonprofit organizations, we carry out our commitment to help communities intervene early and effectively in children's lives. \u2014J. Robert Flores, OJJDP Administrator 16 Faith-Based and Community Initiatives As noted in chapter 1, OJJDP encourages faith-based organizations to work with the Office and other juvenile justice and community programs in prevent\u00ading delinquency. During fiscal year (FY) 2008, the Office actively reached out to these organizations and funded programs ranging from mentoring activi\u00adties to research projects. During FY 2008, OJJDP sponsored numerous training conferences to guide faith-based and community groups through the Federal grantmaking process and to build organizational capacity among these groups. Examples of these training efforts include: OJJDP , in its annual training conferences for State formula grant recipients in Nashville, TN, and Denver, CO, featured a workshop presentation by Steven T. McFarland, Director of the Task Force for Faith-Based and Community Initiatives at the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). The presentation provided practical information on what a State needs to know about how to treat reli\u00adgious nonprofits seeking Federal funding. In March and April 2008, OJJDP held two regional conferences on \"Navigat\u00ading the Future: Accessing and Sustaining Resources for Community and Faith-Based Organizations.\" The conferences\u2014held in Philadelphia, PA, and Los Angeles, CA\u2014brought together several hundred representatives from faith-based and community organizations to hear from key leaders of foun\u00addations and the business community about practical and effective ways to access resources and financially sustain their organizations' work to protect and serve America's at-risk youth. Following are just a few examples of OJJDP's other support of faith-based and community initiatives acr oss the Nation in FY 2008: OJJDP has incorporated language in all of its solicitations for grant applica\u00ad tions (both formula/block grant and discretionary) encouraging State and local units of government to consider faith-based and community organiza\u00adtions for subgrant funding and inviting faith-based organizations to apply for funding or to seek membership in local partnerships or coalitions, where appropriate. The OJJDP-funded Pittsburgh Leadership Foundation of America's (PLFA's) Three-City Demonstration Project concluded successfully in May. The project provided training and technical assistance to strengthen and expand 63 small faith-based and community organizations that serve at-risk youth in targeted neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, PA; Dallas, TX; and Minneapolis, MN. PLFA and its partners in each city worked to expand the program and the organi\u00adzational capabilities of participating groups, and build stronger collaborative efforts to prevent and address delinquency and other related problems such as substance abuse, school failure, truancy, and teen pregnancy. OFFICE OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION CHAPTER 2 Three hundred agency staff and 115 volunteers in the 3 cities received 2,973 hours of technical assistance and coaching from 3 leadership foundations and their partners through a 1-year OJJDP grant. Over the course of the year, these 63 faith-based and community groups expanded their services by 22 percent and increased their funding by 12 percent, while 84 percent formed new service partnerships. Amachi Pittsburgh is a faith-based mentoring initiative of the Pittsburgh Leadership Foundation that provides mentors for children of prisoners in Allegheny County, PA. Amachi Pittsburgh and its community partners develop programs that target children and youth ages 4 to 18 residing in neighborhoods with high rates of incarceration, poverty, unemployment, and crime. This OJJDP-funded mentoring initiative promotes collaboration among community agencies and organizations that support mentoring ser\u00advices. Amachi Pittsburgh will establish fully functional satellite mentoring programs in 15 additional locations for a total of 35 satellites, each providing mentors to a minimum of 10 children of prisoners each year. The Amachi team is focusing on the following outcomes: school performance, develop\u00adment of a positive attitude toward learning, school attendance, academic performance, appropriate behavior, self-confidence, and social skills. Other selected outcomes include improved coping and conflict management skills. Thus far, the Amachi program has served 251 youth with 187 matches and 20 home visits. The program has established partnerships with 30 congregations throughout Allegheny County who assist program staff in recruiting, super\u00advising, and supporting mentors and eligible families. Through a cooperative agreement with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice (FDJJ), OJJDP funded the Faith- and Community-Based Juvenile Detention Treatment Initiative to reach out to youth in moderate to high-risk residential juvenile correctional facilities. The initiative brings together local agencies, faith-based and community organizations, and businesses to provide participating youth with positive, caring adult relationships; greater supervision; and moral leadership as they transition back to their communities. Over the past 5 years, FDJJ has instituted a pilot program that incorporates faith-based interventions with secular programming in an effort to serve delinquents and the larger community. The secular programming emphasizes evidence-based components (largely cognitive/behavioral), which include Thinking for a Change, Character Education, and the Strengthening Families 17 2008 ANNUAL REPORT Program. The faith-based features include the introduction of chaplains into juvenile facilities, the facilitation of faith-based volunteer activities, and the recruitment of faith-based mentors who follow youth from their residential placement into community aftercare. 18 Because of both Federal and State constitutional requirements specifying freedom of religion and worship and barring the establishment of religion, youth who participate in the program, as well as their parents, must volun\u00adtarily agree to placement in a faith-based facility (versus a standard residen\u00adtial program) prior to commitment. Researchers from the University of Florida have conducted a process and outcome evaluation of the project, and two documents are expected to be published by the end of December 2008: Before You Open the Doors: Ten Lessons From Florida's Faith and Community- Based Delinquency Treatment Initiative University of Florida Process Evaluation Report: Facility Incidents and Contacts in the Florida Faith and Community-Based Delinquency Treatment Initiative Research and Evaluation In 2007, OJJDP funded a \"Randomized Controlled Study of Amachi Texas,\" to be conducted by ICF, Inc. The study will include both a process and outcome evaluation, and will determine the impact of Amachi Texas on outcomes for chil\u00addren with incarcerated parents and/or family members. Long-term goals include determining whether the Amachi model can be considered to be an evidence-based program and should be replicated on a national level. Final results are anticipated for 2010. In addition, through its Field-Initiated Research and Evaluation Solicitation, OJJDP funded Baylor University in 2006 to conduct the study, \"Role of Religion in Prosocial Behavior of Youth.\" Key activities of this project included a system\u00adatic review and synthesizing of the religion-crime literature, and identification of key components/factors for implementation by both faith-based and secular programs. The study is near completion, and final results will be available in early 2009. Anti-Gang Initiatives OJJDP has long supported the use of data-driven, strategic anti-gang initiatives that combine prevention, intervention, enforcement, and reentry strategies. Such initiatives require the collaboration of multiple community partners including law enforcement, schools, social services, community and faith-based organiza\u00adtions, key community leaders, citizens, and other partners. Coordinating mul\u00adtiple anti-gang strategies provides the highest potential for long-term success OFFICE OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION 19 2008 ANNUAL REPORT CHAPTER 2 in reducing and eliminating gang activity. During FY 2008, OJJDP provided support to local, State, and Federal parties seeking information and guidance on gang prevention. The Office's major anti-gang efforts are described below. DOJ's Comprehensive Anti-Gang Initiative During FY 2008, OJJDP played a major role in DOJ's Comprehensive Anti-Gang Initiative, launched in 2006. The initiative, coordinated through the U.S. Attor\u00adneys' Offices, emphasizes the importance of working with local partners to coor\u00addinate anti-gang strategies. As a result of this emphasis, U.S. Attorneys' Offices have moved beyond focusing on enforcement-only anti-gang strategies and have begun developing comprehensive communitywide strategies. The project initially began with six sites in Los Angeles, CA; Dallas/Fort Worth, TX; Tampa, FL; Cleveland, OH; Milwaukee, WI; and the 222 corridor north of Philadelphia, PA. The initiative was expanded in 2007 to include Rochester, NY; Oklahoma City, OK; Indianapolis, IN; and Raleigh-Durham, NC. It was further expanded in FY 2008 to 12 sites to include Detroit, MI, and Chicago, IL. OJJDP helped develop this initiative and continues to provide training and technical assistance in the areas of prevention and intervention to all of the sites. The Office has also played a significant role in the delivery of several anti-gang trainings to support DOJ's Project Safe Neighborhoods. The Project Safe Neigh\u00ad borhoods Anti-Gang Training pilot was held in Dover, DE, in September 2007. Approximately 160 law enforcement officers and criminal justice practitioners attended this training, which was delivered by DOJ law enforcement agencies and other criminal justice professionals. Intervention, prevention, suppression, and reentry strategies were presented, as well as a briefing on national and regional gang trends, a community gang problem assessment, and tips for work\u00ading with cooperating witnesses and confidential informants. OJJDP provided the prevention and intervention components of this training in the following loca\u00adtions in 2008: Chapel Hill, NC; Nashville, TN; Oklahoma City, OK; Birmingham, AL; Salt Lake City, UT; Chicago, IL; and Spokane, WA. Gang Prevention Coordination Assistance Program OJJDP initiated the Gang Prevention Coordination Assistance Program in FY 2007 to improve the coordination of resources that support community partner\u00adships implementing two or more of the strategies of OJJDP's Comprehensive Gang Model: prevention, intervention, and suppression. The program funds a coordinator position in each community to identify and leverage a variety of resources to help reduce youth gang crime and violence in targeted neighbor\u00adhoods. The approach emphasizes a balance of gang prevention with enforcement 20 to money available. and commits to using community organizations and faith\u00adbased groups to sustain the work. In 2008, OJJDP received approximately 250 applications and made 12 awards of up to $200,000 each for the 24\u00admonth project. Grantees are the Stockton (CA) Unified School District; Young Visionaries Youth Leadership Academy, San Ber\u00ad nardino, CA; Oakland (CA) Unified School District; City of Norwalk (CT); Leon County School Board, Tallahassee, FL; Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office (FL); SGA Youth & Family Services, Chicago, IL; Roca, Inc., Chelsea, MA; City of Minneapolis (MN); Youth Empowerment Mission, Inc., Brooklyn, NY; City of Cleveland (OH); and Educational Service District 101, Spokane, WA. Gang Reduction Program Since 2002, OJJDP has worked to strengthen the reach and breadth of its efforts to reduce youth gang violence. OJJDP launched the Gang Reduction Program (GRP) in 2003 to reduce youth gang activity in disadvantaged neighborhoods by combining local, State, and Fed\u00ad eral resources in a select number of cities across the country. The program continues today in Los Angeles, CA; North Miami Beach, FL; and Richmond, VA. GRP incorporates three new ingredients to OJJDP's Comprehensive Gang Model, the product of a national gang research and development program ini\u00adtiated in the mid\u00ad1980s. First, GRP makes the recruitment of individuals from faith communities and small community organizations a priority. OJJDP rec\u00adognizes that local churches and charitable organizations will continue to live on long after the Federal Government or large organizations have ended their work. In addition, these local entities often are very efficient, raise their own funds, have existing personal relationships with those in need, and understand the culture and language of the local community. All of this translates into lower costs, faster impact, and longer lasting presence. Second, GRP emphasizes multiagency collaboration, not only locally in neigh\u00ad borhoods and communities but across Federal agencies as well. OJJDP's work on GRP was made substantially easier because Federal funding was extremely flex\u00adible. Funds used in this program came from flexible funding streams at OJJDP and the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, and Labor. GRP grantees can fit dollars to need, instead of needs Third, GRP stresses the importance of partnering with the private sector. At the outset of this effort, OJJDP recognized that success would benefit not only those OFFICE OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION 21 ANNUAL REPOR T CHAPTER 2 children who did not become members of gangs, but the community at large, including businesses. When crime and violence are reduced, the business com\u00admunity, especially small businesses that suffer most from theft and vandalism, experience significant benefits. For example, the GRP effort in Richmond, VA, has led to large-scale improvements and investments in the physical condition of public housing. As a result of GRP , there has been increased safety, more stable tenants, and better tenant care of property. The private-sector operator of those units saw an economic reason to contribute to the Richmond GRP effort. Unlike many previous efforts where communities chose to address enforcement, prevention, or intervention, this GRP effort is bringing all major sectors together and using the strengths of each to address the needs of the communities. The Urban Institute is evaluating the GRP initiative. Preliminary findings reveal significant reductions in both crime rates and violence in the target areas. Fur\u00ad thermore, local governance and communication have steadily improved among members within the local partnerships, and GRP implementation has improved communication about gang issues within the target areas and among participat\u00ading organizations. OJJDP expects to receive the final evaluation report in late December 2008. National Youth Gang Center OJJDP established the National Youth Gang Center (NYGC) in 1994 to expand and maintain the body of critical knowledge about youth gangs and effec\u00adtive responses to them. NYGC provides training and technical assistance on community-based responses to youth gangs and is playing a large role in DOJ's Comprehensive Anti-Gang Initiative. NYGC has a network of trainers, training materials, and curriculums that cover a range of topics such as community gang problem assessment, multidisciplinary gang intervention, and comprehensive community responses to gangs. NYGC also conducts the annual National Youth Gang Survey of police and sher\u00ad iffs' departments to determine the extent of the Nation's gang problem. OJJDP released findings from the 2005 and 2006 surveys in FY 2008. NYGC maintains a Web site with full-text publications on gang programs and research, a bibliography of gang publications that are not available electronically, lists of gang-related legislation broken down by State and subject, and GANG- INFO, a forum for professionals to exchange information about youth gangs. The Web site also maintains a database of gang-related news coverage, to which 2,500 new articles were posted during FY 2008. Online Resource For more information, visit the National Youth Gang Center Web site at www.iir.com/nygc. 2008 22 OFFICE OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION Other Major Accomplishments In addition to the programs highlighted above, OJJDP supported and partici\u00ad pated in several other important anti\u00adgang activities during FY 2008. The 2008 OJJDP National Youth Gang Symposium was held in June in Atlanta, GA. The conference offered innovative and successful gang prevention and intervention programs and strategies and provided the latest information on youth gang activities and trends from top national experts. OJJDP Administrator J. Robert Flores presided over the symposium's main events. OJJDP announced the publication of Best Practices To Address Community Gang Problems: OJJDP's Comprehensive Gang Model at the symposium, an important guide for commu\u00ad nities challenged by gang activity (see sidebar, \"OJJDP Releases Best Practices Guide for Community Gang Prevention\"). Topics covered at the symposium included school\u00adbased prevention and intervention programs, female gangs, gangs in Indian country, alternatives to incarceration, \"gangsta rap,\" and tar\u00adgeted reentry. Cosponsors of the event included Boys & Girls Clubs of America and OJJDP's NYGC. More than 1,200 people attended, including school personnel, law enforcement personnel, researchers, prosecutors, youth leaders, elected officials, government agency personnel, staff from community\u00adbased organizations, and others who are involved in addressing the Nation's youth gang issues. OJJDP RELEASES BEST PRACTICES GUIDE FOR COMMUNITY GANG PREVENTION Published in June, Best Practices To Address Community Gang Problems: OJJDP's Comprehensive Gang Model provides guidance for communities that are considering how best to address a youth gang problem that already exists or threatens to become a reality. The guidance is based on the implementation of OJJDP's Comprehensive Gang Model, which was designed to provide a framework to enhance coordination of local, State, and Federal resources in support of community partnerships implementing anti-gang strategies. The publication describes the research that produced the model, notes essential findings from evaluations of several programs demonstrating the model in a variety of environments, and outlines \"best practices\" obtained from practitioners with years of experience in planning, implementing, and overseeing variations of the model in their communities. 23 2008 ANNUAL REPOR T CHAPTER 2 BOYS & GIRLS CLUBS IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES A grant administered by OJJDP is helping the Boys & Girls Clubs of America (BGCA) make a positive difference in the lives of children who live in public housing. These children are especially vulnerable to the negative impact of poverty and social neglect. BGCA operates clubs in more than 450 public housing communities with additional clubs in distressed urban, suburban, rural, military, and American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities. During FY 2008, BGCA and FirstPic, Inc., established approximately 84 new clubs in public housing communities, with 18 of those new clubs in AI/AN communities. Existing clubs were enhanced in 190 AI/AN communities. To address the prevalence of drug use and juvenile crime in public housing and other distressed communities, clubs that received funding are required to have the youth members participate in at least one approved evidence-based program and to report the results to OJJDP. The clubs can select from a menu of eligible programs, including three programs developed by BGCA: SMART Moves (Skills Mastery and Resistance Training) is a nationally acclaimed prevention program that helps young people resist alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use, and premature sexual activities. The program features engaging, interactive, small-group activities that increase peer support, enhance life skills, build resiliency, and strengthen leadership skills. Targeted Outreach focuses on youth ages 6 to 18 who are at high risk of delinquency and gang involvement and offers them positive alternatives. The clubs collaborate with local partners to mobilize community resources, employ special strategies to recruit hard-to-reach youth, place targeted youth into appropriate club programs, and monitor the progress of at-risk youth on a case-by-case basis. Project Learn reinforces and enhances the skills and knowledge young people acquire at school and during the hours they spend at the club. Youth participate in several hours of structured activities each week such as leisure reading, writing activities, discussions with adults, helping others, tutoring, and games that draw on cognitive skills. The program also encourages parent involvement and works closely with parents. During the grant period (April 1, 2007 through June 30, 2008), local clubs under BGCA leadership established approximately 285 new club sites in distressed areas, with awards totaling approximately $14 million to local club organizations. Reporting by the subgrantee clubs indicates that they recruited approximately 45,000 new members and leveraged $8 million in additional funding from other funding sources. At least one approved evidence-based program was incorporated at each of the new clubs established with Office of Justice Programs funding. Approximately 184 clubs implemented SMART Moves; 196 Project Learn; 22 Targeted Outreach and 7 other programs identified through the OJJDP evidence-based Model Programs Guide. Additionally, BGCA issued approximately 162 \"capacity building\" letters of agreement, (totaling approximately $6.3 million) and approximately 277 \"teen outreach\" letters of agreement (totaling approximately $6.3 million) to local club organizations. Clubs receiving these dollars reported recruiting approximately 29,754 new teen members and leveraged approximately $3.9 million in additional funding from other sources. 24 OFFICE OF JUVENILE In addition to ongoing evaluation activity of OJJDP's Gang Reduction Program, in FY 2007 OJJDP also competitively funded a new study by the Urban Institute entitled \"Norms and Networks of Latino Gang Youth.\" This study is using a social network framework to understand the patterns of relations among Latino gang/group members and the nature of the links binding these groups to their social contexts. The study will fill an important gap in the growing body of gang literature regarding how interpersonal relationships and networks shape social interaction, and, in turn, individual\u00adlevel pro\u00ad or antisocial behavior (e.g., group\u00adbased criminal behavior). The study results are anticipated in 2010. Online Resource For more information about OJJDP's anti-gang initiatives, visit the OJJDP Web site at www.ojp. usdoj.gov/ojjdp. Mentoring Activities Mentoring is an effective way to prevent at\u00adrisk youth from becoming involved in delinquency and to help already delinquent youth change their lives for the better. Mentoring relationships have been shown to improve youth's self\u00adesteem, behavior, and academic performance. OJJDP has long supported mentoring programs, receiving appropriations of more than $200 million since 1994 to support juvenile and youth mentoring programs. In FY 2008, OJJDP awarded more than $60 million to support community mentoring programs, including funding that addressed the needs of underserved, at\u00adrisk youth populations in American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities and Latino communities with youth gang problems. Following are brief descriptions of the four FY 2008 mentoring programs. Latino Youth Mentoring Program The goals of the 2008 Latino Youth Mentoring Program are to prevent gang par\u00ad ticipation and violence by offering healthy alternatives and to reduce and pre\u00advent delinquency, violence, dropping out of school, and truancy. OJJDP sought applicants to establish a school\u00adbased peer mentoring program for high school youth. Adolescents already acclimated to high school and the surrounding com\u00admunity would serve as peer mentors to new students and incoming ninth grad\u00aders. Identified by school staff, these incoming students would be recruited to join this afterschool program. OJJDP made awards totaling more than $1.8 million under this program. The projects are funded for up to 3 years. The following initiatives were awarded funding in FY 2008: the Arlington (TX) Independent JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION CHAPTER 2 School District, Big Brothers/Big Sisters of NYC, the Marilyn G. Rabb Founda\u00ad tion, and Colors of Success, Inc.

Bush, OJJDP made awards totaling more than $55 million under this program. in a statement proclaiming January 2008 as National Mentoring Month Strengthening Youth Mentoring Through Community Partnerships Program This program encourages collaboration among nontraditional partners. Non\u00ad traditional partners may not have mentoring as their primary mission but have areas of common or overlapping interest that include providing services and support to at\u00adrisk youth. These partners may include community and/or faith\u00adbased organizations, nonprofits, health and 25 2008 ANNUAL REPORT community and/or faith\u00adbased organizations, nonprofits, health and mental health organizations, substance abuse prevention organiza\u00ad tions, social services and early childhood/elementary educational systems, educational/vocational entities, universities/colleges, and other governmental or tribal units and agencies. The goal of the partnerships is to develop the community's capacity to provide new and existing mentoring services for at\u00adrisk youth and to facil\u00aditate the communication, collaboration, and delivery of mentor\u00ading services among service providers, community stakeholders, and governmental partners. OJJDP made awards totaling more than $5.3 million under this program. Other Mentoring Programs In addition to the FY 2008 grants described above, OJJDP continued to sponsor ongoing mentoring programs targeted to system\u00adinvolved youth. 26 September 2008. In FY 2006, OJJDP developed the Mentoring Initiative for System-Involved Youth (MISIY) for young people involved in the juvenile justice system or in foster care and for juvenile offenders reentering their communities. The pro\u00adgram supports organizations that implement initiatives that will develop new mentoring approaches or strengthen and expand existing mentoring programs. Examples include support to address new mentoring approaches in under-served communities, such as public housing or tribal reservations and efforts to recruit mentors from underused groups such as college students and fraternal organizations. This initiative also promotes collaboration among community agencies and organizations committed to supporting mentoring services. The Office awarded 4-year grants totaling $1.6 million to four communities to pilot mentoring programs for system-involved youth. The pilot programs are described below. The Boys & Girls Aid Society's Mentor Portland (OR) program provides men\u00ad toring to youth ages 10 to 14 who are in the foster care system or have an incarcerated parent. The organization is using the MISIY grant to implement one-on-one and team-based mentoring for 136 youth in foster care. Lutheran Family Services of Virginia's Mentor Match in Roanoke, VA, pro\u00ad vides one-on-one, community-based mentoring to 20 youth ages 8 to 18 who are in foster care and the juvenile justice system. With the MISIY grant, the organization plans to serve 140 additional youth by 2010. The youth will be recruited through established relationships with the local juvenile court system, social services agency, and Lutheran Family Services. The city of Chicago's Department of Children and Youth Services is using MISIY funds to support four community-based organizations that provide economic mentoring to adolescent males who are involved in the juvenile justice system or are at risk for entering the system. One of the goals of this program is to help youth develop an individual plan to ensure that they are connected to work or school. The Mentoring Center in Oakland, CA, serves youth reentering the com\u00ad munity from a juvenile residential rehabilitation facility. The center is using MISIY funding to develop a mentoring program aimed at reducing rearrest and recommitment rates among 240 young people ages 15 to 18. OJJDP also awarded a 2-year grant to the Education Development Center, a Boston-area based global nonprofit, to provide training and technical assistance to the grantees. The first group training for the grantees was held in December 2006 in New Orleans, LA, and a regional training and planning meeting were held in May 2007 in Chicago, IL. Cross-site training was held in New Orleans in OFFICE OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION 27 2008 ANNUAL REPOR T CHAPTER 2 OJJDP ADVOCATES MENTORING PROGRAMS OJJDP Administrator J. Robert Flores urged the members of the Hispanic National Bar Association (HNBA) to participate in mentoring programs that serve Hispanic youth, citing mentoring as a critical element in helping youth avoid joining gangs. Flores spoke at HNBA's 33rd Annual Conference, held in September in Hollywood, CA, a district within the city of Los Angeles. Administrator Flores restated DOJ's and OJJDP's commitment to reducing gang activity through the comprehensive gang-reduction strategy, which emphasizes prevention, intervention, reentry programs, law enforcement, and crime suppression. Los Angeles has the largest gang population in the country, with more than 400 gangs and 39,000 members. DOJ has invested more than $15.5 million to support the city's comprehensive gang-reduction strategy. Juvenile Drug Court Initiative During FY 2008, OJJDP partnered with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) to enhance the capacity and quality of treatment for youthful offenders in juvenile courts and juvenile drug courts by supporting the implementation of the Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (BIRT) model. This treatment strategy includes assess\u00adment, brief intervention, and treatment protocols that are proven, evidence-based practices to address the problem of substance abuse in juveniles. Awards of up to $530,000 for a 2-year period were provided to Ashland County (WI), Miami-Dade County (FL), and the Florida State Attorney's Office (Fourth Judi\u00adcial Circuit) to implement the model. This treatment intervention has been tested in CSAT's Cannabis Youth Treatment Study and has proven to be effective in terms of individual outcomes and cost. The awardees will receive training and technical assistance from the National Association of Drug Court Professionals. To help determine the effectiveness of the MISIY program, OJJDP also awarded a 4-year grant to the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation (PIRE) to conduct process and outcome evaluations of the program. PIRE has developed and provided each site with a customized outcome data collection package with instructions and a master manual. PIRE also began the development of a literature review that is incorporating the most relevant mentoring research in the field. Findings from the process and outcome evaluations are anticipated in 2010. 28 evaluation are in progress. OJJDP also continues to support a 4-year initiative launched in FY 2007 with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) to help communities address the needs of juvenile offenders who are substance abusers. The program is based on Reclaiming Futures, an RWJF program that brings communities together to improve drug and alcohol treatment, expand and coordinate services, and find jobs and volunteer work for young people in trouble with the law. The Juvenile Drug Court Initiative is helping three jurisdictions partner with States, State and local courts, units of local government, and tribal governments to develop and establish juvenile drug courts for substance-abusing juvenile offenders. The program will enable communities to identify substance-abusing youth, match them with appropriate treatment options, and deliver services through a coalition of providers working under the guidance of a local court. OJJDP is collaborating on the initiative with CSAT and RWJF. OJJDP initially awarded nearly $1.3 million over 4 years for the initiative. In FY 2008, CSAT col\u00adlaborated with OJJDP to provide supplemental funding of up to $300,000 to each site to support the treatment components of the program. Greene County, MO, is applying RWJF's Reclaiming Futures model to a pilot juvenile drug court, launched in January 2007 under the Greene County Juvenile Court. The integrated system will enhance and expand treatment services, implement a system of care to coordinate all social services, and increase opportunities for youth and families in Greene County. The Hocking County (OH) Juvenile Court, which has been operating for 9 years, is integrating its juvenile drug court program with the Reclaiming Futures model to reduce the number of substance-abusing youth, help them meet educational goals, and increase the number of youth living drug- and crime-free lives. The New York State Unified Court System is applying the Reclaiming Futures model to the Nassau County Juvenile Treatment Court program to improve coordination among the Nassau County Family Court and public and nonprofit agencies working with justice-involved juveniles. The goal is to improve the identification of juveniles requiring substance abuse treat\u00adment, expand the screening and assessment of respondents in juvenile delinquency petitions, and engage youth more effectively in treatment by increasing the number and range of effective treatment options. CSAT is providing technical assistance during the first year to support the treat\u00ad ment component, and R WJF is helping sites implement the Reclaiming Futures model. Grantees are also eligible to receive training and technical assistance through the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges.

Enforcing the Underage Drinking Laws Program OJJDP has administered the Enforcing the Underage Drinking Laws (EUDL) program since Congress created the initiative in 1998. The program has four components: Block grants awarded to each State and territory and the District of Columbia to improve the enforcement of underage drinking laws. Discretionary grants awarded to competitively selected States to support the demonstration of best or promising practices at the local level. Training and technical assistance, with research translation that aids program development and implementation, provided to grantees by the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation. An evaluation of the Community Trials Initiative conducted by Wake Forest University School of Medicine (WFUSM); and an evaluation of the Rural Commu\u00adnities Initiative and military discretionary program supported by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA). This chapter focuses on EUDL's discretionary grants and evaluation activities. For more information on EUDL's block grants and training and technical assistance, see chapter 3. EUDL discretionary grants support several varied initiatives, all aimed at helping local communities use a comprehensive approach to address underage drinking. In an effort to address underage drinking issues in collegiate environ\u00adments, FY 2008 EUDL discretionary funding aims to reduce the availability of alcoholic beverages to and the consumption of alcoholic beverages by university and college students younger than 21 years old in three States\u2014Illinois, Nevada, and South Carolina. Each State is establishing partnerships with university/college campuses and adjacent communities to implement research-based and promising practices. The initiative aims to decrease the number of first-time alcohol-related incidents; decrease the incidence of unintentional injuries related to alcohol con\u00adsumption among underage persons; and reduce alcohol-related traffic injuries or fatalities among underage persons. 2008 Launched with FY 2004 and FY 2005 EUDL discretionary funding, the Rural Communities Initiative has been implemented in seven States\u2014California, Illinois, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Washington. The initiative is nearing conclusion of its program efforts to establish or enhance research\u00adbased practices to enforce underage drinking laws in rural communi\u00adties. Grantees who received funding in 2004 concluded implementation activities in 2008 and are now engaged in sustainability efforts; grantees funded in 2005 will conclude implementation efforts in 2009, to be followed by sustainability age drinking and alcohol\u00adrelated misconduct by underage airmen.

Juvenile Integrated Information Sharing Agencies responsible for the health and well\u00adbeing of youth in both State and local jurisdictions struggle to improve their information\u00adsharing capabilities to make their programs more effective and efficient. Many agencies do not have\u2014 and urgently need\u2014access to accurate and timely information to assist them in determining appropriate supervision, services, and sanctions for youth. Confidentiality requirements are an essential component in developing these information\u00adsharing systems. To address this need, OJJDP is supporting the Center for Network Develop\u00ad ment's (CND's) Juvenile Information Sharing (JIS) Project. The project is devel\u00adoping curriculums and providing national training and followup assistance to address issues that arise in information sharing in the juvenile justice community. JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION CHAPTER 2 In partnership with CND, OJJDP in 2006 released the publication, Guidelines for Juvenile Information Sharing, which provides standards and methods for juvenile justice agencies to implement successful information\u00adsharing models. The guide\u00ad lines are an essential resource to assist local and State partnering jurisdictions in developing information\u00adsharing procedures that are both effective and in com\u00adpliance with confidentiality requirements. The guidelines have been widely publicized by 53 national and local agencies, universities, and organizations representing juvenile justice and related fields, and cited in at least 10 professional information\u00adsharing publications. In addi\u00adtion, several jurisdictions in Colorado, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Wyoming adopted the guidelines to develop JIS plans or craft juvenile information\u00adsharing legislation. In addition to the guidelines, the JIS Project is developing a data model using Extensible Markup Language (XML) with juvenile justice as the focus. This Juvenile Justice XML Data Model will enable agencies within a juvenile collaborative to effectively exchange juvenile information. In FY 2008, OJJDP launched a series of online training and technical assistance events, or Webinars, providing information on technological advances and issues of privacy. The first of the series focused on XML and introduced participants to its capabilities for improving information sharing. The second training, \"State Juvenile Records Laws and Interagency Collaboration,\" provided a framework for analyzing State laws as recommended in the Guidelines for Juvenile Information Sharing. More than 100 juvenile professionals participated in this highly antici\u00adpated session. Future trainings will focus on strategies to make the sharing of client information more accurate, flexible, and adaptable. OJJDP is sponsoring an expanding JIS Web site, which serves as a clearinghouse for information on training and technical assistance opportunities, JIS Project updates, tools, and pro\u00adfiles of promising juvenile information sharing efforts. Online Resources Additional information about the Juvenile Information Sharing Project is available from www.juvenileis.org and from the OJJDP Web site, www.ojp.usdoj.gov/ojjdp (select the \"Programs\" section). The project's information-sharing tools are accessible at www.juvenileis.org. 2008 31 ANNUAL REPOR T 32 year designated as a planning year. Tribal Youth Program In FY 2008, OJJDP received an appropriation for tribal youth programming for the 10th consecutive year. During this time, Congress has appropriated more than $120 million to promote juvenile justice in Indian country. OJJDP carries out this appropriation through two programs that award grants to federally recognized tribes for activities that prevent and control delinquency and improve the effectiveness of tribal juvenile justice systems. The programs are the Tribal Youth Program (TYP) and the Tribal Juvenile Accountability Dis\u00adcretionary Grants Program (T-JADG). In FY 2008, a newly funded program, Mentoring Programs for At-Risk Tribal Youth, awarded two grants. OJJDP is also funding training and technical assistance activities and research and evaluation programs to measure program effectiveness and identify resources and needs among federally recognized tribes. Funding OJJDP revamped its FY 2008 TYP solicitation to encompass a 5-year grant period, including a planning year. Eighteen TYP grants totaling $8 million were awarded in FY 2008 to tribes in 15 States. OJJDP also provided extensive training to FY 2008 grant recipients, including training that focused on successful com\u00admunity planning. The T-JADG program provides funds for programs that hold American Indian/ Alaska Native youth accountable for their offenses while providing the neces\u00ad sary resources and support for positive outcomes and reduced recidivism. In FY 2008, OJJDP awarded T-JADG grants totaling more than $1 million to the Coquille Indian Tribe in Oregon, the Chippewa Cree in Montana, and the Fallon Paiute Tribe in Nevada. In FY 2008, OJJDP provided $2 million in funding to the Boys & Girls Clubs of America and $2 million to Big Brothers/Big Sisters for mentoring programs for at-risk AI/AN youth. Training and Technical Assistance In FY 2007, OJJDP allowed TYP grantees to designate the first year of their 4-year grant as a planning year. This enabled newly funded applicants to request training and technical assistance to help them develop a comprehensive strategic plan and learn how to collect and use program evaluation and performance data during the remaining years of the award. As a result of comments submitted by grantees, OJJDP extended the grant period in FY 2008 to 5 years, with the first OFFICE OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION CHAPTER 2 In FY 2008, OJJDP entered into a cooperative agreement with Education Devel\u00ad opment Center, Inc., to fund a Tribal Youth Training and Technical Assistance Center to provide culturally sensitive training and technical assistance to TYP grantees and all federally recognized tribes in Indian country. The technical assistance includes access to professional staff with expertise in the development of culturally based approaches to prevention and intervention, capacity building, strategic planning, program implementation, program evaluation, and program sustainability. OJJDP also provides annual regional TYP trainings for grantees. The training focuses on helping tribes apply their strengths and experiences to develop and maintain programs that are valuable to their communities. In addition, TYP joined the One OJP Tribal Justice and Safety Training and Tech\u00adnical Assistance initiative launched by the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) Assis\u00adtant Attorney General. This initiative provides training and information to tribal leaders, administrators, program managers, and grant writers on resources avail\u00adable from OJP and OJJDP . During sessions held in FY 2007 and FY 2008, OJJDP coordinated its regional training schedule to coincide with the One OJP ses\u00adsions. The first One OJP session included workshops that highlighted TYP and T-JADG, addressed juvenile justice priorities related to public safety in Indian country, and provided information on available funding and resources. During an FY 2008 session held in Billings, MT, OJJDP facilitated a consulta\u00ad tion session on juvenile justice issues to encourage dialog among tribal leaders and program representatives and other Federal agency representatives. The OJP Assistant Attorney General participated throughout this session, which pro\u00adduced numerous recommendations for Federal efforts to assist tribes. These recommendations are expected to be made available in late 2008. OJJDP staff participated in the development of a training module, Working Effectively with T ribal Governments, a tool for Federal employees who work directly with tribal governments. The workshop was designed to provide rep\u00adresentatives of the Federal Government who oversee AI/AN programs with the opportunity to examine the complex cultural issues affecting the provision of services to diverse tribal communities, and to teach specific skills for effectively addressing these issues. Online Resource The training module, Working Effectively with Tribal Governments, is available at www.GoLearn.gov. 2008 33 ANNUAL REPOR T 34 completion in 2010. Research Activities OJJDP is also funding several TYP research and evaluation activities. Funded primarily through OJJDP's field-initiated research and evaluation solicitations in 2006 and 2007, these projects demonstrate an ongoing commitment to under\u00adstanding more about tribal youth and communities. CSR, Inc. is conducting a 2-year process evaluation of OJJDP's administration of the Tribal Youth Program. OJJDP will use the information from this study to better understand how federally recognized tribes use the grant funds they are awarded, and how OJJDP can better support program implementa\u00adtion and sustainability. The lessons learned from this evaluation will also be useful for other Federal and State grantmaking agencies that seek to improve their grant programs and training and technical assistance to tribal communi\u00adties. The final report for this study is expected by mid-2009. The National Indian Youth Leadership Development Project is examining Project Venture, a nationally recognized substance abuse and delinquency prevention program that is being replicated in more than 50 AI/AN and other communities around the Nation. Although the program, which originated in New Mexico, has been implemented nationally, little is known about its implementation in areas outside of New Mexico. The study is scheduled for completion in late 2009. The American Youth Policy Forum is documenting three ongoing TYP activities and will produce a report that provides a clear picture of effective tribal youth programs. The report, anticipated to be released in March 2009, will describe connections among infrastructure, funding, and leveraging of resources, including volunteers and community organizations. The University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, in collaboration with Southern Ute Indian tribe, is conducting a collaborative evaluation of the TuuCai Tribal Juvenile Wellness Court. The court was established through OJJDP's juvenile drug court program for substance-involved tribal youth on the Southern Ute Indian Reservation in Ignacio, CO. The project is scheduled for completion in mid-2009. Prevent Child Abuse America, in partnership with the National Indian Child Welfare Association and other partners\u2014Purdue University, Macro Interna\u00adtional, and key AI/AN researchers\u2014is studying tribal youth victimization and delinquency. The research is designed to increase knowledge about the severity and extent of tribal youth victimization, tribal adult caregivers' per\u00adceptions of youth victimization, and intervention and treatment resources available to tribal youth. The 3-year study began in 2007 and is scheduled for OFFICE OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION 35 2008 ANNUAL REPOR T CHAPTER 2 The Pima (AZ) Prevention Partnership Minority Youth Border Research Ini\u00ad tiative is exploring why justice-involved tribal and minority youth in south\u00adwestern border communities are at greater risk for early onset of substance abuse and long-term persistence of delinquency, victimization, and mental illness compared with their nonminority youth peers. Researchers will develop recommendations regarding specific service needs of juvenile justice-involved minority youth in southern Arizona. T-JADG GRANT HELPS TRIBE ADDRESS UNDERAGE DRINkING On the Rocky Boy's Indian Reservation in rural Montana, the Chippewa Cree Tribe is fighting underage drinking through the innovative Healing to Wellness Program, thanks to an OJJDP Tribal Juvenile Accountability Discretionary Grants Program (T-JADG) award. The Healing to Wellness Program uses the same basic strategies used by other juvenile drug courts in nontribal communities. The Healing to Wellness Program helps juveniles recognize and take steps to overcome their drinking problem through evaluations, individual treatment plans, and cultural activities designed to build self-esteem. The 9-month program partners with a network of agencies that sponsor youth programs that address substance abuse and foster healthy lifestyles. The program provides incentives to motivate tribal youth to turn their lives around: court sentences are deferred while the youth participate in the program; if juveniles complete the program, prosecution is deferred. The program consists of four phases with built-in accountability. The first phase includes clinical treatment, weekly court appearances, random drug and alcohol tests, and community service. Youth must be enrolled in school and participate in cultural awareness activities. The second phase emphasizes personal responsibility; juveniles must continue to meet a curfew, visit with a juvenile court counselor, and participate in drug and alcohol education. In the third phase, the young people begin assessing and applying what they have learned by mentoring other youth in the program and participating in other activities. During the final phase, adolescents are taught to recognize the signs of relapse, and the number of treatment sessions and random drug and alcohol tests is reduced. The tribe recently expanded the program to include working with parents, providing education and information that fosters the health and well-being of the entire family. The goal is to ensure that tribal youth grow up in an environment that predisposes them to success and a healthy way of living. 36 OFFICE OF JUVENILE Online Resource TYP staff are also working with the National Center for Juvenile Justice on a report that summarizes national-level data on AI/AN youth. Modeled on OJJDP's Juvenile Offenders and Victims: National Report, the document will focus specifically on AI/AN youth. The report will be available in mid-2009.

Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention The Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention con\u00ad tinued its efforts in FY 2008 to improve the coordination of federally funded youth programs. The Council has nine members representing eight Federal agencies and up to nine practitioner members representing disciplines that focus on youth. The Attorney General is the ex-officio chairperson, and the OJJDP Administrator is the vice chairperson. The Council meets quarterly. Council meetings in FY 2008 focused on the following areas: youth drug abuse and public health challenges, OJJDP's research on girls and practitioner perspec\u00ad tives on girls, the challenges facing boys and opportunities to address those chal\u00adlenges, religiosity and positive youth development, and a retrospective of the work of this Administration. Council staff and partner agencies spent considerable time collaborating on cross-agency work, including mentoring and State and local planning processes. Notably, staff devoted significant time to developing a set of Web-based tools and resources to assist Federal staff in developing, implementing, and support\u00ading comprehensive community initiatives, as well as compiling information on youth-related activities among member and key Federal agencies as an aid to future planning. The Council funded four new interagency agreements in FY 2008. Funds were provided to the U.S. Department of Labor to support enhanced coordination of Federal resources for disadvantaged youth, primarily through the Shared Youth Vision program; to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for activities aimed at preventing child and adolescent injuries and deaths; to the Corporation for National and Community Service to create a Web presence for the Federal Mentoring Council; and to the National Endowment for the Arts to expand model theater programming for at-risk youth.

JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION CHAPTER 3 38 CHAPTER 3 Strengthening the Juvenile Justice System Through the JJDP Act The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (JJDP) Act, most recently reauthorized in 2002 and implemented in fiscal year (FY) 2004, aims to treat juvenile delinquents in a fair and equitable manner, while ensuring their placement in appropriate facilities as needed. The Act authorizes the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) to award formula grants to help States meet the goals of the Act. During FY 2008, OJJDP worked with the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the 5 territories, providing financial and technical assis\u00adtance to assist with the implementation of the mandates of the JJDP Act. As required by the Act, the Office worked closely with States to develop strategies to reduce the disproportionate num\u00adber of minority youth who come into contact with the justice system. The Office also worked with States to help them implement accountability-based reforms and to develop collaborative, community-based delinquency prevention programs. These activities are helping States realize the importance of forming partnerships and leveraging a variety of resources to help make a difference for youth by strengthening the juvenile justice system. Formula Grants Program Congress established OJJDP and created the Formula Grants program in 1974 when it passed the JJDP Act. The Formula Grants program provides funds to States to help them implement OFFICE OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION 39 2008 ANNUAL REPORT OJJDP works proactively with States to ensure they maintain or improve compliance with all of the core requirements of the JJDP Act. A major focus is developing strategies to reduce the disproportionate number of minority youth who come into contact with the justice system. comprehensive juvenile justice plans and programs to prevent delinquency and improve their juvenile justice systems.1 OJJDP awarded approximately $60 million in Formula Grant funds to designated State agencies in FY 2008. To be eligible to receive a formula grant, a State must address and strive to remain in compliance with the four core requirements of the JJDP Act, which require States to: Deinstitutionalize status offenders (DSO). Separate juveniles from adults in secure facilities (separation). Remove juveniles from adult jails and lockups (jail removal). Reduce disproportionate minority contact (DMC) within the juvenile justice system. 2 1 In this chapter, the term \"States\" also encompasses U.S. territories and the District of Columbia. Wyoming does not participate in the Formula Grants program. 2 In 1988, Congress first required States participating in the Formula Grants program to reduce the disproportionate number of minor\u00ad ity youth confined in secure facilities. The issue was elevated to a core requirement in 1992, and then broadened in 2002 to encompass disproportionate representation of minorities at any point in the juvenile justice system. 40 In FY 2008, OJJDP made site visits to a number of States, provided technical assistance, and sponsored numerous training conferences to assist States in implementing comprehensive juvenile justice plans and programs to prevent delinquency and improve their juvenile justice systems. In October 2007, OJJDP held a comprehensive training in Denver, CO, entitled \"Creating a Shared Vision for Juvenile Justice,\" which provided critical training information for State juvenile justice specialists, Title V coordinators, Juvenile Accountability Block Grants (JABG) coordinators, State Advisory Group (SAG) members, SAG youth members, and other juvenile justice program staff. Ses\u00adsions covered such topics as concrete ways to help SAGs operate more efficiently and effectively, key components of an effective request for proposal, and the importance of strategic planning as it relates to a State's 3-year plan. This train\u00ading also featured a separate SAG youth member track to enable SAG youth to network with other youth members throughout the Nation. In addition, to assist JABG and Title V coordinators, workshops pertinent to the various grant pr ograms were held. These included sessions on a practical application of the link between child welfare and juvenile justice; an overview of the U.S. Department of Justice's (DOJ's) Office of Civil Rights; an overview of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 and the creation of the Sex Offender Sentencing, Monitoring, Apprehending, Registering and Tracking (SMART) Office within the Office of Justice Programs; and OJJDP's Girls Study Group: Working with Juvenile Female Offenders. Officials from the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS') Administration for Children and Families participated in workshops on workforce development and runaway and home\u00adless youth. The conference also featured a discussion on the implementation of the Shared Youth Vision Initiative by DOL, HHS, DOJ, and the U.S. Depart\u00adment of Education. These agencies have formed a Federal partnership focused on serving the neediest youth. The initiative, created in response to the 2003 report White House Task Force Report for Disadvantaged Youth, fosters collaboration by youth service systems at all levels in designing and coordinating programs assisting this population. In August 2008, OJJDP held a training conference entitled \"Charting the Course: Developing Effective Plans for the Future\" in Nashville, TN. The 244 partici\u00ad pants from the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the 5 territories included State Advisory Group members (including SAG youth members), compliance monitors, JABG coordinators, Title V coordinators, and DMC coordinators. OFFICE OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION 41 2008 ANNUAL REPOR T CHAPTER 3 Topics at the conference included developing an effective 3-year comprehensive plan, meeting the core requirements of the JJDP Act, addressing the welfare of juveniles in detention, preparing State DMC plans, and circumstances affect\u00ading tribal communities implementing and sustaining their own juvenile justice programs. The OJJDP Enforcing Underage Drinking Laws (EUDL) Conference, which directly followed the Charting the Course conference at the same Nash\u00adville location, provided an opportunity for State juvenile justice specialists to network and collaborate with their State counterparts who administer the EUDL block grants program. (More information on the EUDL Conference is provided later in this chapter.) OJJDP's National Training and Technical Assistance Center (NTTAC) provided training and technical assistance to more than 1,400 participants in 34 States for the Formula Grants program in FY 2008. The program areas that received the most requests for training and technical assistance were DMC reduction and juvenile justice system improvement. Compliance monitoring, delinquency prevention, strategic community action planning, mental health services, gender-specific services, and planning and administration were also frequently requested areas of assistance. Participants included representatives of tribal com\u00admunities, the court system, law enforcement, and service providers. ADVISORY COmmITTEE OJJDP obtains advice and guidance from the States, the territories, and the District of Columbia through the Federal Advisory Committee on Juvenile Justice (FACJJ). The Committee is an advisory body established by the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (JJDP) Act, as amended (Section 223) and supported by OJJDP. The role of FACJJ is to advise the President and Congress on matters related to juvenile justice and delinquency prevention, to advise the OJJDP Administrator on the work of OJJDP, and to evaluate the progress and accomplishments of juvenile justice activities and projects. FACJJ comprises appointed representatives from the State Advisory Groups (SAGs) of each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the 5 territories. (SAGs are appointed by the Governors and assist their States in developing and implementing the juvenile justice plans their States are required to submit to OJJDP every 3 years in order to receive formula grant funds.) The advisory committee's mandated responsibilities include preparing two annual recommendation reports\u2014one to the President and Congress, and one to the Office. Federal Advisory Committee on Juvenile Justice 42 DMC Activities Compliance Progress Congress modified some of the requirements and penalties for noncompliance when it reauthorized the JJDP Act in 2002. OJJDP worked with the States to share this information and assist State agencies with training to meet the new mandates. The Office conducted a series of regional and national training confer\u00adences to explain the changes and answer questions, established new guidelines, developed documents, and updated Web pages to help juvenile justice policy-makers and practitioners prepare for the legislative changes. OJJDP's extensive training and technical assistance is making a difference: all participating States have made significant progress in achieving compliance with the four core requirements of the JJDP Act. For example, a comparison between baseline violations (based on data submitted when a State first begins participat\u00ading in the Formula Grants Program) and current violations (based on data used to determine funding eligibility for FY 2008) illustrates the progress States have made: DSO violations have decreased 97.2 percent, from 171,474 to 4,728. Separation violations have decreased 99.3 percent, from 83,826 to 615. Jail removal violations have decreased 97.6 percent, from 157,067 to 3,724. Compliance rates have remained steady, with the majority of States reporting minimal or no violations of DSO, separation, and jail removal requirements. Although DMC compliance cannot be measured in terms of violations, States must show OJJDP that they are working to reduce the disproportionate number of minority youth who come into contact with the juvenile justice system, and some States are making significant progress in this area. OJJDP's DMC accom\u00adplishments are discussed below. In FY 2008, most States qualified to receive the maximum amount of formula grant funds on the basis of compliance status. (For more compliance informa\u00ad tion, see appendix B.) State progress toward achieving the goals of the JJDP Act has been remarkable. However, the har d work of sustaining that progress remains. OJJDP continues to provide an intensive program of training and technical assistance to help States address compliance issues. Despite recent improvements, minorities remain overrepresented in the juvenile justice system. Long a leader in the Nation's efforts to reduce disproportion\u00ad ate minority contact, OJJDP continues to increase the scope and number of its OFFICE OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION CHAPTER 3 resources\u2014including training, technical assistance, publications, and research activities\u2014to help States address this issue. FY 2008 was a productive year for the DMC program and included many accomplishments. OJJDP held a national conference and conducted two training events in FY 2008 to address DMC. In October 2007, OJJDP held its 12th annual DMC conference, \"Reducing Dis\u00ad proportionate Minority Contact in Juvenile Justice by Making the Right Con\u00adnections,\" in Denver, CO. It attracted a sellout audience of 450 participants from across the country. The conference provided critical information to support State and local DMC\u00adreduction efforts and insights into next steps. The conference featured workshops and panel presentations on best practices that may reduce DMC at different juvenile justice contact points, the development and use of risk assessment instruments, and cultural competency training. OJJDP held two training sessions for DMC coordinators\u2014 one for novices and one for more experienced practitioners. The first session, \"Training for New DMC Coordinators,\" was held in January in New Orleans, LA. Fifteen new State DMC coordinators participated in the intensive 3\u00adday train\u00ading that focused on the role of a DMC coordinator, the abil\u00adity to communicate clearly what DMC is, how to measure it, and how to design evidence\u00adbased strategies to reduce it. The training sessions offered instructions on how to help community groups and their SAGs work collab\u00adoratively, systematically, and continuously toward DMC reduction. Sessions had an additional emphasis on how to perform coordina\u00adtor duties, such as how to develop and write an effective DMC compliance plan. \"Training of Trainers for Experienced DMC Coordinators,\" held in February in Phoenix, AZ, was designed to enhance the skills of experienced DMC coordina\u00adtors so they can effectively train and guide communities within their States on DMC reduction. Instruction also focused on enhancing participants' communica\u00adtion and group facilitation skills. Performance Measures Following is a summary of performance data reported by formula grantees and subgrantees: In 2008, States and territories reported data for a total of 1,775 subgrants across 43 2008 ANNUAL REPORT more than 900 separate organizations. This represents more than $98 million in funded activities. Funds were allocated to activities across many program areas, and the activities with the largest funding allocations included: 44 OFFICE OF JUVENILE of youth. Delinquency prevention (29 percent). Disproportionate minority contact (10 percent). Juvenile justice system improvement (9 percent). Formula grant programs served more than 518,000 youth during the reporting period. Of these youth: 77 percent completed program requirements. 75 percent exhibited a desired change in the targeted behavior. 3 9 percent offended or reoffended during the program period. Of the formula grant-funded programs, about 40 percent reported implementing at least one evidence-based program.

REPORT OFFERS NEW INSIGHTS INTO DmC With funding from OJJDP, the Program of Research on the Causes and Correlates of Delinquency has issued the report Disproportionate Minority Contact in the Justice System: A Study of Differential Minority Arrest/Referral to Court in Three Cities. The report draws on information from delinquency studies in Pittsburgh, PA, Rochester, NY, and Seattle, WA, to examine disproportionate minority contact (DmC) and factors that might affect it at the police contact/court referral level. The report reached three conclusions: There was clear evidence of DmC at all three sites. DmC cannot be explained by the differences in offending behavior of different racial groups. DmC was substantially reduced by considering the combined effect of a number of additional risk factors for arrest; multiple risk factors do a better job of explaining DmC than does delinquent behavior. 3 Targeted behaviors differed, depending on the youth's specific program goals. In the majority of cases, JABG programs targeted a reduction in antisocial behavior, improved school attendance, or increased social competence JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION 45 2008 ANNUAL REPORT CHAPTER 3 Juvenile Accountability Block Grants Program The Juvenile Accountability Block Grants program helps States and communi\u00ad ties improve their juvenile justice systems by implementing accountability-based reforms that focus on both offenders and the juvenile justice system. JABG-funded programs hold young offenders responsible for their actions by applying swift, consistent sanctions that are proportionate to the severity of the offense. JABG improves the juvenile justice system by helping jurisdictions track juve\u00adniles efficiently through the system and provide enhanced options such as res\u00adtitution, community service, victim-offender mediation, and restorative justice sanctions. OJJDP distributed approximately $42 million in FY 2008 under the JABG pro\u00ad gram. Recipients must use their JABG funds to support activities in 1 of 17 pro\u00adgram areas centered on 4 types of activities: hiring staff, building infrastructure, implementing programs, and training staff. OJJDP also provides training and technical assistance through a number of providers: The National Training and Technical Assistance Center (NTTAC) provides telephone or onsite training and technical assistance. The majority of the requests NTTAC received in FY 2008 for JABG training and technical assis\u00adtance involved requests for corrections/detention facilities, restorative justice, juvenile courts and probation, detention/corrections personnel, training for law enforcement and court personnel, information sharing, and risk and needs assessment. Approximately 530 participants received training and technical assistance at 35 events in 16 States. Participants included proba\u00adtion officers, substance abuse treatment providers, family advocates, judges, clerks and court staff, juvenile justice residential and detention staff, commu\u00adnity organizations, and juvenile justice coalition members. CSR, Inc. manages the Data Collection and Technical Assistance Tool that OJJDP encourages States to use when submitting JABG performance mea\u00adsurement data. CSR staff also provide training and support on the use of the JABG performance measures. The JABG Technical Support Center, established by OJJDP with assistance from the Bureau of Justice Statistics and a grant to the Justice Research and Statistics Association, provides States the data they need to calculate JABG allocations for local jurisdictions. 46 Performance Measures To assess the effectiveness of the JABG program, OJJDP developed a set of per\u00ad formance measures that have helped the Office, Congress, and the juvenile jus\u00adtice field see the progress and challenges facing the program. During FY 2008, OJJDP continued to work with the States to collect quantitative performance measure data. For 2008, States and territories reported data for a total of 1,552 subgrants across more than 900 separate organizations. This represents more than $79 million in funded activities. While funds were allocated to activities across all 17 JABG program areas, the activities with the largest funding allocations included: Accountability-based programs (22 percent). Court/probation programming (13 percent). Information sharing (10 percent). JABG programs served more than 215,000 youth during the 2008 reporting period. Of these youth: 16 percent reoffended during the program. 62 percent exhibited a desired change in targeted behavior. 4 Of the JABG-funded programs, about one-fifth (18 percent) were implementing at least one evidence-based program. In FY 2008, OJJDP reached an agreement with the Office of Management and Budget on annual and long-term performance measures for the upcoming JABG Program Assessment Rating Tool review, scheduled for 2010. lll SucceSS StORieS: JABG PROGRAm The following descriptions are just a couple examples of how OJJDP and the Juvenile Accountability Block Grants (JABG) program are helping local and State jurisdictions strengthen their juvenile justice systems. Alternatives to Detention (Maine) The Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program in Portland, ME, was created to help address overcrowding in the detention unit at Long Creek Youth Development Center. ATD provides 4 Targeted behaviors differed, depending on the youth's specific program goals. In the majority of cases, JABG programs targeted a reduction in antisocial behavior, improved school attendance, or increased social competence of youth. OFFICE OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION 47 2008 ANNUAL REPORT CHAPTER 3 96 percent of parents/guardians (of offender) believed their child had learned something from 96 percent of juvenile offenders believed they had learned something that could prevent a simi\u00ad supervision for youth in the community so that they can be released from detention while awaiting their appearance in court. Services include an afternoon\u00adevening reporting center and intensive case management. A system of graduated sanctions and rewards provides incentives, and community supports are fostered that will remain in place after youth are discharged from the program. Combined with other efforts, ATD has contributed to a significant drop in the detention population. From April 2007 through March 2008, the ATD program served 24 youth using graduated sanctions. The program's effectiveness is illustrated by the following statistics: 90 percent of youth leaving the program successfully completed program requirements. Only 12.5 percent of youth reoffended while in the program. 90 percent of youth with a goal of finding employment were placed in jobs. All of the youth appeared in court as scheduled and did not interfere with the court process. Participating youth completed 175 hours of service to the community. Juvenile Accountability Conferences (North Dakota) Juvenile accountability conferences provide the opportunity for an offender, victim, and key supporters of both to come together with a trained facilita\u00adtor to discuss the impact of the crime and how to repair the harm caused. As part of its restorative justice program, North Dakota's Juvenile Court has used juvenile accountability conferences statewide as an intervention for misdemeanor offenders and property offenders at all levels. The conferences have had a tremendous impact on the individuals involved and increased system responsiveness by addressing reparation and accountability for the offenders while fulfilling concerns of the victims and communities. Participation in juvenile accountability conferences is voluntary. Satisfaction surveys, which are completed by the victims, parents/guardians, and juvenile offenders, have shown very positive outcomes: 95 percent of victims stated it was helpful to meet the offender. 94 percent of victims believed the offender had learned from the process. the process. lar incident from occurring. 84 percent of juvenile offenders believed that it was helpful to meet the victim. 48 allocations included: programs in the Nation. Outcomes also can be measured by recidivism rates, which are based on the number of youth who are rearrested or seen at juvenile court for a new delinquent offense occurring 6 months after program completion. The program was highly successful by this measure as well: 90 percent of juveniles completing a juvenile accountability conference did not reoffend. This figure represents the most recent performance measure data and appears to be higher than the success rates of other restorative justice Title V Community Prevention Grants Program The Title V Community Prevention Grants Program (Title V) helps communities develop a comprehensive, research-based approach to delinquency prevention. The goal is to improve outcomes for youth by reducing risk factors and enhanc\u00ading protective factors in schools, communities, and families. Extensive research has shown that risk factors are associated with the likelihood that a youth will engage in delinquent behavior, and protective factors help pre\u00ad vent or reduce that likelihood. The Title V program provides funds that enable communities to address these factors in a locally suitable and sustainable man\u00adner. The program encourages local leaders to initiate multidisciplinary needs assessments of the risks and resources in their communities and develop locally relevant prevention plans that simultaneously draw on community resources, address local gaps in services or risks, and employ evidence-based or theory-driven strategies. In FY 2008, OJJDP awarded $48,360 to most States. The JJDP Act requires Title V grantees to garner a 50-percent funding match from the State and/or localities, thereby maximizing the chance of success for Title V-funded programs. Performance Measures During FY 2008, OJJDP continued to work with States to collect quantitative per\u00adformance measure data. Following is a summary of performance data reported by Title V grantees and subgrantees: In 2008, States and territories reported data for a total of 288 subgrants. This represents mor e than $15 million in funded activities. Funds were allocated to activities across many program areas, and the activities with the largest funding OFFICE OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION 49 2008 ANNUAL REPORT CHAPTER 3 Delinquency prevention (80 percent). School programs (8 percent). Mental health services (3 percent). Title V programs served more than 56,000 youth during the reporting period. Of these youth: 82 percent completed program requirements. 46 percent exhibited a desired change in the targeted behavior. 5 Of the Title V grant-funded programs, more than half (54 percent) reported implementing at least one evidence-based program. Title V Training and Technical Assistance OJJDP offers a three-part training series to help grantees write successful 3-year delinquency prevention plans. The training includes: Community team orientation, which brings together key local leaders and provides an overview of the Title V model. Community data collection and analysis training, which helps participants review, analyze, prioritize, and present the data they have collected. Community plan and program development training, which shows partici\u00adpants how to use data to develop delinquency prevention plans and how to select appropriate strategies using the Model Programs Guide (for more information, see sidebar, \"Model Programs Guide\"). During FY 2008, more than 45 juvenile justice staff and participants received one or more of the six Title V trainings at one of three locations, the District of Columbia, Oklahoma, and Utah. Because membership in a community coalition is a prerequisite for Title V funding, training participants included community leaders, program developers, researchers, and others who are involved in mobi\u00adlizing the community, governing, or serving children. The Office also provides specialized training in performance measurement and evaluation, evidence-based practices, and sustainability. The training is available to Title V subgrantees, juvenile justice specialists, and Title V coordinators. 5 Targeted behaviors differed, depending on the youth's specific program goals. In the majority of cases, JABG programs targeted a reduction in antisocial behavior, improved school attendance, or increased social competence of youth. 50 Online Resource To learn more about the Formula Grants, Juvenile Accountability Block Grants, and Title V Community Prevention Grants programs, go to the OJJDP Web site at www.ojp.usdoj.gov/ojjdp and click on the \"Programs\" section. mODEL PROGRAmS GUIDE The OJJDP model Programs Guide is a user-friendly, online portal to scientifically tested and proven programs that address a range of issues across the juvenile justice spectrum. Developed as a tool to support the Title V Program, the Guide profiles more than 175 prevention and intervention programs and helps communities identify those that best suit their needs. Users can search the Guide's database by program category, target population, risk and protective factors, effectiveness rating, and other parameters. OJJDP recently expanded the Guide to include strategies and programs that show promise in helping jurisdictions reduce disproportionate minority contact. The additional programs include jurisdictional strategies and single programs. In keeping with its commitment to encourage collaboration, OJJDP also expanded the model Programs Guide to identify evidence-based programs that focus on at-risk and delinquent youth. The Office partnered with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Substance Abuse and mental Health Services Administration, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the U.S. Departments of Education and Labor to identify these programs. As a result of this collaboration, the Guide, which served as the foundation for the development of the Community Guide to Helping America's Youth (described in chapter 1), includes proven programs that focus on youth problems such as tobacco use, trauma exposure, academic failure, poor interpersonal skills, family dysfunction, social and community disorganization, and sexual activity/exploitation. Online Resource To access the model Programs Guide, go to the OJJDP Web site at www.ojp.usdoj. gov/ojjdp and click on the Guide under the \"Programs\" section. lll SucceSS StORy: TITLE V PROGRAm An important goal of the Title V Program is to improve outcomes for youth by reducing risk factors in different areas of a child's life, including school, home, and the peer environment. Close collaboration between community partners offers the best hope of providing children with the comprehensive help they need to tackle what are often-complex problems. Following is a description of how one community is using Title V funding to launch a coordinated approach to address truancy . The approach is designed to increase public awareness about the problem, hold juveniles accountable, and facilitate communication between community partners. OFFICE OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION 51 2008 ANNUAL REPORT CHAPTER 3 Working Together To Combat Truancy (Kentucky) With assistance from Title V funding, community agencies, schools, and the family court in Fayette County, KY, are partnering\u2014with notable success\u2014to improve school attendance. One community organization that has made a sig\u00adnificant difference is the Truancy Assessment Center (TAC), established in 2006. The center, which targets youth ages 12-17, has assessed and provided services to a total of 118 youth and 112 families experiencing problems with school attendance. TAC completes a holistic, comprehensive assessment of the family's strengths, needs, and issues affecting school attendance and refers the family to the most appropriate community partner for services. Referrals come directly from the Fayette County Public Schools (FCPS) and family court. Any youth who has accumulated three or more unexcused absences and is not receiving services from any other program is eligible for services. TAC is an important participant in the family court's Truancy Collaboration, a multiagency prevention program established in 2004. The Truancy Collaboration meets monthly and, over the last 4 years, has changed Fayette County's response to habitual truancy. In 2007, the Fayette County family court ordered FCPS to file a petition on every youth with 12 or more unexcused absences so they could come directly to court for supervision by the judge. That year, FCPS filed 855 petitions\u2014an increase of more than 400 from the previous year\u2014and the family court processed 629 cases. Starting in 2007, staff from each of Fayette County's middle, high, and alternative schools were scheduled to be in court on certain days. Youth are set for review on the day their school will be present. Having the school staff present in court increases accountability for both the youth and the school. TAC staff and other community partners share information and resources available for each case. In addition, TAC staff, the judge, and other community partners make a presentation at least once a year in all middle and high schools to provide parents and youth with information about resources available to assist youth and families, truancy laws, and the policies for and consequences of noncompliance. This new approach is proving to be an important tool in deterring truancy. Data indicate that the family court's supervision of truant youth is highly effective. Partners reviewed all the youth who were seen by the family court judge on March 5 and 12, 2007, for a total of 37 cases. The average number of unexcused absences the youth had before seeing the judge was 35; the average after seeing the judge was 9. The University of Kentucky College of Social Work evaluated this information and found these numbers to be statistically significant. In the summer of 2008, Truancy Collaboration partners reviewed the attendance for school years 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 of all the cases processed by the court in 2007 (a cohort of more than 600). 52 Based on the results of the 37 cases mentioned, the new system has generated additional funds for FCPS. Those youth increased their attendance by an average of 26 days, generating $13 a day for each day a youth is in school, resulting in additional funds of $12,506. If there is similar improvement in just half of the 600 member cohort, the new system is easily generating approximately $100,000 each year for the school system. The Truancy Collaboration will use this information to request that FCPS sustain the Truancy Assessment Center. Enforcing the Underage Drinking Laws Program The Enforcing the Underage Drinking Laws (EUDL) program comprises both block grants and discretionary grants. This chapter focuses on EUDL's block grants and training and technical assistance activities. For information about EUDL's discretionary grants activities, see chapter 2. Under the EUDL block grants program, each State, the District of Columbia, and the five territories r eceived $350,000 in FY 2008, totaling more than $19 million for the program. These EUDL funds support a wide range of activities. Many States focus on enforcement, emphasizing compliance checks of retail alcohol outlets. Other enforcement activities include crackdowns on false identification, programs to deter older youth or adults from providing alcohol to minors, party patrols to prevent drinking at large gatherings, cops in shops to keep minors from purchasing alcohol, youth-focused campaigns to enforce impaired driv\u00ading laws, and source investigations to determine the source of alcohol and hold the responsible party accountable for their role in the alcohol-related incidence. The funds also support public education programs and innovative methods for reaching youth. The training and technical assistance component of the EUDL program has been instrumental in helping communities and States enforce underage drinking laws around the country. OJJDP's Underage Drinking Enforcement and Training Center (UDETC) is managed by the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation and provides publications, training workshops, curriculums, regional meetings, national conferences, onsite strategic technical assistance, teleconferences, online resources to include alcohol enforcement databases, and other services. In FY 2008, UDETC conducted a total of 97 trainings, reaching more than 3,000 indi\u00adviduals in 29 States. One of the highlights of the EUDL program in FY 2008 was the 10th anniver\u00ad sary National Leadership Confer ence (NLC), held in Nashville, TN, in August. Attended by more than 2,000 individuals, the conference included among its speakers J. Robert Flores, OJJDP Administrator; Dr. Ralph Hingson, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism; Col. Evan Hoapili, U.S. Air Force OFFICE OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION 53 2008 ANNUAL REPOR T CHAPTER 3 (retired); and other distinguished speakers representing Federal, State, and local efforts. The conference focused on evidence-based strategies to reduce youth access to alcohol and highlighted the successes of community and enforcement leaders. A new, intensive, year-long training and technical assistance program known as the Leadership Institute was launched during the 2008 NLC. The program involves participation of pilot communities in Illinois, Montana, and Wisconsin. The purpose of the program is to develop and refine leadership skills for com\u00admunity action to effectively address underage drinking-related issues by reduc\u00ading youth access to alcohol and consumption of alcoholic beverages. FY 2009 will launch a new youth leadership initiative called the UDETC Youth Council. The goal of this initiative is to provide youth ages 15 to 18 with effec\u00adtive prevention tools and strong leadership skills to support their work toward implementing successful environmental prevention in their local communities and States. Online Resources For more information on the EUDL program, visit the OJJDP Web site at www.ojp.usdoj.gov/ ojjdp and click on the \"Programs\" section and the UDETC Web site at www.udetc.org. l l l SucceSS StORieS: EUDL PROGRAm The Enforcing the Underage Drinking Laws (EUDL) program is the only Federal initiative directed exclusively toward preventing underage drinking. Following are examples of how the EUDL laws are helping families, communities, drug abuse authorities, and law enforcement work together to address this serious problem. Alcohol Enforcement Teams (South Carolina) South Carolina has implemented Alcohol Enforcement Teams (AETs)\u2014multijurisdictional partnerships that use best-practice enforcement strategies to reduce underage drinking. These strategies include enforcement compliance checks, party patrols, merchant education, and publicity of such activities through the news media. In 2006, EUDL funds were used to expand the number of South Carolina counties involved. By 2007, the State had allocated $1.6 million to create AETs in all 16 counties in the State. By October 2007, all of the teams were active. Only 5 months into FY 2008, State totals for various activities had surpassed those for all of FY 2007. Compliance checks\u2014visits to ensure merchants comply with underage drinking laws\u2014had increased 90 percent, to a total of 2,559 checks; 185 public safety checkpoints had been operated; and more than 11,500 tickets had been issued for various alcohol-related offenses. In addition, 1,245 merchants in one county had been trained through a merchant education program. 54 \"Social Host\" Ordinances (Minnesota) During FY 2008, three Minnesota towns passed \"social host\" ordinances, laws that hold hosts of parties criminally liable for underage drinking on their property. Social host laws have increased in acceptance across the Nation as young people have suffered fatal accidents after attending parties where alcohol was supplied by adults. Although the specifics of each law vary by municipality, they typically require jail time and a fine for adults who knowingly supply minors with alcohol, or the space in which to consume it. The town council of Mankato, MN, passed its social host ordinance in November 2007; Fairfax, MN, passed its law in December 2007; and Waseca, MN, passed its ordinance in March 2008. As of August 2008, 11 Minnesota municipalities had passed such laws. OFFICE OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION CHAPTER 4 56 CHAPTER 4 Defending Children Against Victimization The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) strives to protect America's children from abuse, exploitation, and victimization. Although physical and sexual abuse of children is not a new problem, access to the Internet has changed the way predators harm children. Families, child protection agencies, and law enforcement now must guard against online victimization of children. During fiscal year (FY) 2008, OJJDP devel\u00adoped significant partnerships with prosecutors and law enforcement agencies to respond to these heinous crimes. Unfortunately, many of the children the Office seeks to protect live in environments that are not nurturing, respectful, or protective. Whether the negative influences come from live-in partners, abusive adults in the home, delinquent peers, or other factors, many youth simply do not have the support they need to become responsible adults. Without assistance, some of these youth will perpetuate a legacy of delinquency and despair. With help, however, many of these youth can discover a renewed sense of security, worth, and self-fulfillment. That is why the Office funded activities during FY 2008 to prevent and reduce the negative impact of community and family violence on young children. OJJDP activities highlighted in this chapter provide a broad picture of how OJJDP is working with communities and law enforcement and social service agencies across the country to vigor\u00ad ously defend America's children against abuse and exploitation. OFFICE OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION 57 OJJDP is working vigorously with communities and law enforcement and social services agencies across the country to protect children from Internet crimes, commercial sexual exploitation, abduction, and abuse. Through programs such as Project Safe Childhood, OJJDP is building a brighter future for America's youth. Project Safe Childhood In May 2006, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales launched the Project Safe Childhood (PSC) initiative to improve the prosecution of computer-facilitated child exploitation and to enhance community outreach to educate families about risks to children over the Internet. The initia\u00adtive coordinates the efforts of the U.S. Attorneys; Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) task forces; Federal partners, including the FBI, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Immigration and Cus\u00adtoms Enforcement, and the U.S. Marshals Service; national organizations such as the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC); and State and local law enforcement officials in each U.S. Attorney's district. OJJDP continued to support the PSC initiative through its $17 million investment in the ICAC task force pr ogram in FY 2008. The ICAC program is a network of State and local law enforce\u00ad ment cyberunits that investigate and prosecute cases of child sexual exploitation. OJJDP also supported the second national PSC training conference held in St. Louis, MO, in December 2007 and funded and coordinated the third national PSC training conference held in Columbus, OH, in September 2008. The approximately 1,500 conference attendees at the Columbus event included ICAC task force commanders and officers, U.S. Attorneys from all 93 districts, Assistant U.S. Attorneys, and community partners including State and local law 2008 ANNUAL REPORT enforcement officers. OJJDP and the ICAC task forces and other Federal agen\u00ad cies provided training in investigations, prosecutions, and other critical issues. PSC and ICAC previously held separate conferences; the 2008 joint conference allowed the two groups to conduct joint training and sharing of best practices while continuing to build relationships across agencies and jurisdictions. 58 OFFICE OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION behavior. tunity to participate in workshops and lectures to further their ment investigators, forensic experts, and prosecutors an oppor\u00adThe conference provided Federal, State, and local law enforce\u00ad tunity to participate in workshops and lectures to further their ment investigators, forensic experts, and prosecutors an The knowledge while providing them with the tools necessary to combat online exploitation of children. The training sessions focused on how to increase collaboration and cooperation among law enforcement agencies and Federal prosecutors on child pornography cases, forensics methods, and the legal and technical aspects of child exploitation cases, among other top\u00ad ics. At the conference, Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey announced a new memorandum of understanding among Federal law enforcement agencies to share case information to improve coordination of investigations. During FY 2008, OJJDP conducted PSC trainings across the country attended by nearly 800 individuals. The Office anticipates holding an additional three training events through the end of 2008 to provide training to all U.S. Attorneys' districts. Also in FY 2008, OJJDP led the planning of a month\u00adlong national media cam\u00ad paign as part of DOJ's Project Safe Childhood initiative to combat the online exploitation of children. Launched in November 2008, the $2.5 million campaign used a combination of public service announcements (PSAs) in English and Spanish on national cable television channels, print ads, and Internet promotions such as banner ads, pop\u00adup ads, and Webisodes. Regional promotions\u2014radio spots, movie theater PSAs, and media events\u2014also were held in four cities: Miami, St. Louis, Seattle, and San Diego. These cities were chosen for additional media exposure based on the number of Internet sexual crimes against children reported in these locations, population size, and media market size. The PSAs promote two themes: one reminds parents that the Internet can be an unsafe place for children and that children should be supervised when online. A second set of ads is aimed at men ages 18 to 40 to deter would\u00adbe sexual preda\u00adtors from using the Internet to entice minors into engaging in illegal sexual 59 ANNUAL REPOR T CHAPTER 4 Through outreach and education, we are working to make sure that kids know how to use the Internet wisely and safely, and parents know that they need to monitor their children's online activities to protect them from harmful materials or personal relationships they may develop while online. \u2014OJJDP Administrator J. Robert Flores, speaking at the press event launching a month-long media campaign to combat the online sexual exploitation of children While ads have been produced previously to educate parents about online sex\u00ad ual predators, this is the first time public safety announcements have addressed potential predators. The campaign was produced by OJJDP in conjunction with media partner Hispanic Communications Network, child Internet safety organizations iKeepSafe and INOBTR (\"I Know Better\"), and the Self Reliance Foundation. The national launch event in Washington, DC, drew DOJ officials, local school superintendents, members of PSC partnering agencies, law enforcement officials, child advocacy groups, and other organizations committed to the well\u00adbeing of children. National media press outlets also attended. In his opening remarks at the press event, Administrator Flores stressed the need to warn the public that online sexual preda\u00adtion of minors is a crime and to educate parents about the potential threats facing their children online. In addition to the national awareness campaign, OJJDP supported PSC efforts at the local level in FY 2008 through funding to the following organiza\u00adtions: the San Diego Police Foundation, Web Wise Kids, Prevent Child Abuse Vermont, Washtenaw Area Council for Children, and the Northeast Washington Education Council (Educational Service District 101). These projects featured various outreach efforts and innovative programming to schools, youth and community organizations, business entities, and parent groups. Using local, regional, statewide, and multistate strategies, these programs provided compre\u00adhensive training, curriculums, and online educational programming designed to assist in providing online safety for children.

Internet Crimes Against Children Task Forces Recognizing that victimization in cyberspace poses a unique threat to the health and safety of children and a formidable challenge to law enforcement, OJJDP created the Internet Crimes Against Children task force program in 1998. The program has created a network of State and local law enforcement cyberunits that investigate cases of child exploitation. The task forces use aggressive inves\u00adtigations, prosecutions, computer forensics, and community outreach to address cybercrime. 2008 60 OFFICE OF JUVENILE There are 59 ICAC task forces nationwide. OJJDP also has a robust training and technical assistance program that delivers courses on best practices for prosecu\u00adtors, basic investigative techniques, undercover protocols, and other highly tech\u00adnical investigative tools to nearly 500 law enforcement officers and prosecutors annually. The ICAC program has been extremely successful in targeting predators who use cyberspace to entice children. In FY 2008, ICAC task forces received more than 32,000 complaints of technology-facilitated child sexual exploitation. Inves\u00adtigations initiated from complaints have led to more than 3,047 arrests, forensics examinations of more than 13,800 computers, and more than 6,000 case referrals to non-ICAC law enforcement agencies. Also in FY 2008, nearly 29,000 law enforcement officers and prosecutors received ICAC training. A major source of complaints reviewed by ICAC task forces come from NCMEC's CyberTipline, which has received more than 629,000 calls since the system was activated in 1998. NCMEC and the ICAC program also collaborated to develop a Child Victim Identification Lab. The computer lab, which debuted in 2006, assists NCMEC in identifying children who are depicted in child por\u00adnography pictures and movies. The ICAC Training & Technical Assistance Program, funded through a coopera\u00ad tive agreement with Fox Valley Technical College, provides training and tech\u00ad nical assistance to the task force agencies. Training is designed for ICAC task force members as well as affiliated law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, and parole/probation officers. Courses include the ICAC Investigative Techniques Program, ICAC Undercover Chat Investigations Training Program, ICAC Unit Supervisor Training Program, ICAC Trial Advocacy Program for Prosecutors, ICAC Child Sex Offender Accountability Training Program, and ICAC CyberTip Management Program.

Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children The commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) involves crimes of a sexual nature committed against juvenile victims for financial or other economic reasons. These crimes include trafficking for sexual purposes, prostitution, sex tourism, mail-order-bride trade and early marriage, pornography, stripping, and performing in sexual venues such as peep shows or clubs. CSEC is not only JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION 61 2008 ANNUAL REPOR T CHAPTER 4 illegal, it brings about significant and, at times, life-threatening physical, mental, and emotional harm to these children. In its ongoing effort to educate community agencies and the public about this serious issue, OJJDP conducted a two-part workshop in July on its Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children Community Intervention Project at the annual Multidisciplinary Conference on Child Abuse in Orlando, FL, sponsored by the Florida Network of Children's Advocacy Centers in collaboration with the Flor\u00adida Department of Law Enforcement, among other groups. OJJDP's Intervention Project is expanding the capacity of communities to address CSEC. Also in FY 2008, the Office saw two of its research studies completed. The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority's study on the prostitu\u00ad tion of children has helped to develop a deeper understanding of child sex\u00ad ual exploitation and made several recommendations on ways to aid children in one of the most neglected forms of child abuse. The Urban Institute completed a longitudinal analysis of Federal prosecu\u00ad tions to determine how prosecutions influence both CSEC service provid\u00ad ers and victims. This was the first analysis conducted since the Trafficking of Persons Protection Act was passed in 2000. OJJDP will publish a bulletin summarizing the results of this study in FY 2009. OJJDP: 10-YEAR HISTORY OF COmBATING CSEC In January 2008, OJJDP Administrator J. Robert Flores addressed the Anti-Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children Community Intervention Project's Training the Trainer Institute. The institute, sponsored by OJJDP and held in Washington, DC, trained individuals from nongovernmental, law enforcement, and prosecutorial agencies in the DC metropolitan area. Administrator Flores highlighted OJJDP's longstanding commitment to fighting commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC): Starting with its initial efforts to address child sexual exploitation through the Internet Crimes Against Children task force program and the FBI's Innocent Images National Initiative in 1998, the Department has expanded its efforts to include commercial sexual exploitation of children. In 2003, OJJDP sponsored a summit on the prostitution of children. That same year, OJJDP provided funds to Atlanta and New York City to support efforts to address commercial sexual exploitation of children. With the launch of Project Safe Childhood in 2006, the Department has organized the resources of Federal, State, and local law enforcement and prosecutors to aggressively attack child sexual exploitation. The Department is working to develop a deeper understanding of this issue and to facilitate the exchange of information and promising practices and collaborative efforts among Federal, State, and local officials. 62 OFFICE OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION National Center for Missing & Exploited Children OJJDP funds the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC), which provides 24\u00adhour services and support to families, children, law enforce\u00adment agencies, and Federal agencies dealing with missing and exploited chil\u00addren. In FY 2008, the Center received 97,842 calls and assisted in the recovery of 13,590 children\u2014more than a 20 percent increase over the FY 2007 total for recovered children. NCMEC also manages the CyberTipline, which allows computer users and ser\u00ad vice providers to report Internet\u00adbased child pornography and exploitation. Dur\u00ading FY 2008, the CyberTipline handled approximately 109,000 reports regarding potential child exploitation or online harm to children. Since the beginning of operations in 1998, the CyberTipline has processed approximately 629,000 online reports. The Child Victim Identification Program (CVIP), a mechanism to identify vic\u00ad tims of child pornography, was used to identify more than 520 children in por\u00adnographic images and videos during FY 2008. To date, there are a total of 1,742 identified child victims in the CVIP system. NCMEC also is a key participant in the annual Missing Children's Day com\u00ad memoration and the AMBER Alert program, both described below.

Sexually Assaulted Children: National Estimates and Characteristics provides information on the estimated number and characteristics of children who were sexually assaulted in the United States in 1999. 63 2008 ANNUAL REPOR T CHAPTER 4 Missing Children's Day The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) commemorates National Missing Children's Day annually to remember missing children and their families and to recognize law enforce\u00adment personnel and private citizens for outstanding efforts on behalf of missing children. The ceremony for the 25th National Missing Children's Day was held in May at DOJ's Great Hall of Justice. This year's ceremony stressed the Department's efforts to bring missing children home safely and highlighted the progress made through initiatives that the Department, its components, and State and local part\u00adners have developed and implemented to protect children, such as PSC, which marked its second anniversary last spring. Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey presented awards to law enforcement officers and citizens who were instrumental in the recovery of missing children. I would tell people to make sure that they are open with their family, open with their children. . . . To not let it hold you back, to not let it pull you down. . . .

The publication was released at the missing Children's Day 2008 ceremony in may in Washington, DC. Written by five young adults who were abducted as children, the publication is designed to help those who experience abduction begin to put their lives back together. It joins two previous guides OJJDP created for families coping with abduction: When Your Child Is Missing: A Family Survival Guide and What About Me? Coping With the Abduction of a Brother or Sister. You're Not Alone was featured on a September 10, 2008, episode of the nationally syndicated Oprah Winfrey Show, when one of the authors, Elizabeth Smart, discussed her abduction and recovery on the program. The Oprah Web site featured links to the PDF file of the publication and a new child abduction resource page OJJDP created for its Web site to support inquiries generated by the show's promotion. There were more than 7,000 visits to the PDF file of the publication on September 10 and 11. You're Not Alone also was highlighted in the June 25 issue of People magazine. Written by five young adults who were abducted as children, AMBER Alert The AMBER Alert program, which marked its 12th anniversary in 2008, has helped recover more than 430 abducted children nationwide.6 AMBER Alerts are media alerts that are broadcast on radio, television, and highway signs when a law enforcement agency determines that a child has been abducted and is in imminent danger. The broadcasts provide information about the child and the abductor that could lead to the child's recovery, such as a physical description of each and a description of the abductor's vehicle. All 50 States, the District of Columbia, and 2 territories have AMBER Alert plans. The program is managed by the Office of Justice Programs (OJP), with the support of OJJDP . In FY 2008, nearly $4.5 million was appropriated for the program. AMBER Alert activities include annual national training conferences\u2014the 2007 and 2008 conferences were held in Denver, CO, and Garden Grove, CA, respectively\u2014and local and regional training on topics such as Child Abduction Response Teams (CARTs) and investigative techniques. The 2008 national conference also provided the opportunity to share information about the AMBER Alert program with representatives from Mexico, France, England, Belgium, Greece, and Canada. In 2008, under a cooperative agreement with Fox Valley Technical College, OJJDP provided 11 CART training and technical assistance programs to 596 par\u00ad ticipants. Participating agencies were encouraged to review existing policies and practices and ways interagency and regional cooperation could improve miss\u00ading and abducted children casework. Participants received guidance on creating memorandums of understanding, resource inventories, and action plans to use when they returned home to guide them through the development of a CART, thereby building a foundation for improving response capacity, resource coordi\u00adnation, and child recovery capabilities in their jurisdictions.

An AMBER Alert was issued. The child was safely rescued in Florida after an individual who was aware of the AMBER Alert told law enforcement that the suspect and child were en route to Florida. In Palmdale, CA, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department (LASD) activated an AMBER Alert for two siblings, ages 5 and 9, who were taken from their custodial grandparents by their noncustodial mother. Past incidents had led the LASD to believe the children were in danger. A Sacramento County sheriff's deputy, who was aware of the AMBER Alert, located the suspect's vehicle, which was parked at a motel. The suspect was later identified and arrested, and both children were rescued. In Racine, WI, an 11-month-old child was taken by force from an apartment by an ex-boyfriend of the child's mother. The abductor took the child and left a note indicating the mother would get her child back when she repaid $2,000 that the abductor claimed she owed him. An AMBER Alert was issued. The abductor heard the Alert and gave the child to a third party. The child was returned safely to his mother. AMBER Alert in Indian Country Through its AMBER Alert in Indian Country initiative, OJP has developed AMBER Alert plans in 13 selected tribal communities. Assessments of capabili\u00adties have been conducted at all sites, with the focus on building capacity within each community to respond to and investigate reports of endangered, missing, or abducted children. OJJDP provided a range of training and technical assis\u00adtance in FY 2008 to build on these capabilities. Twelve sites have adopted or are in the process of adopting AMBER Alert pro\u00ad grams, either alone or in cooperation with State and local authorities, and 10 of the 13 tribes have passed tribal resolutions or ordinances adopting the AMBER Alert program. At least 10 of the participating tribal communities are developing their own CARTs or are participating with local agencies that have CART programs. Each of the sites received an equipment allocation to help procure the technol\u00ad ogy needed to implement an AMBER Alert. Allocations were based on several characteristics, including community needs assessments, tribal population, adoption of a tribal resolution to create an AMBER Alert plan, and participation 66 at AMBER Alert in Indian Country trainings and meetings. Through a donation from NCMEC, each of the tribes was given a computer, printer, fax machine, and camera dedicated to finding missing children on Indian lands. Interest in the AMBER Alert in Indian Country initiative continues to grow, and there have been approximately 50 requests for technical assistance from tribal communities for FY 2009. Children's Advocacy Centers OJJDP's Children's Advocacy Centers (CACs) are facility-based programs that help coordinate the investigation, treatment, and prosecution of child abuse cases. Recognizing that child abuse is a multifaceted problem, CACs involve multidisciplinary teams of professionals\u2014child protective and victim advocacy services, medical and mental health agencies, and law enforcement and prosecution\u2014to provide a continuum of services to victims and nonoffending family members. Working together, these professionals gain a more complete understanding of each case, allowing them to identify the most effective response. OJJDP's CAC program is funded under the Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990. In FY 2008, $15 million was appropriated for the program. One of the primary goals of the CAC program is to ensure that child abuse vic\u00ad tims are not further traumatized by the systems designed to protect them. By developing a comprehensive and appropriate response to child abuse, CACs can help minimize the trauma to children who, in addition to dealing with the physical, emotional, and psychological effects of their abuse, may need to serve as witnesses in criminal prosecutions or be placed in alternate home settings. OJJDP supports regional CACs in the Midwest, Northeast, South, and West. These centers encourage communities to establish local CACs and provide exist\u00ad ing CACs with training, technical assistance, and other services. Currently, there are more than 700 CACs nationwide, and last year they provided services to more than 240,000 children. The Office also supports the National Children's Alliance, a nonprofit organization that provides services to local CACs. An OJJDP-funded study conducted by the University of New Hampshire's Crimes Against Children Resear ch Center evaluated the impact of CACs on chil\u00ad dren, families, and communities. Researchers gathered data on more than 1,000 cases of child sexual abuse from four CACs and from comparison communities without CACs. In August, OJJDP published Evaluating Children's Advocacy Cen\u00ad ters' Response to Child Sexual Abuse, a Bulletin based on the study's findings (see sidebar, \"OJJDP Releases Bulletin on Effectiveness of CACs\"). OFFICE OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION 67 2008 ANNUAL REPOR T CHAPTER 4 CACs have been growing internationally and are under development in Canada, Iceland, Poland, Norway, and Sweden.

OJJDP RELEASES BULLETIN ON EFFECTIVENESS OF CAC S In August, OJJDP published Evaluating Children's Advocacy Centers' Response to Child Sexual Abuse, a Bulletin summarizing the findings of the study on the effectiveness of CACs conducted by researchers at the University of New Hampshire's Crimes Against Children Research Center. As described above, the study demonstrated the important role these centers can play in advancing child abuse investigations. The study included the following findings: Better coordination of investigations. Police in CAC communities were involved in 81 percent of child protective services investigations of sexual abuse, compared with 52 percent in other communities. Team interviews (two or more observers) were more common in CAC cases (28 percent) than non-CAC cases (6 percent). more medical exams. In the CAC sample, nearly half (48 percent) of child victims received a forensic medical examination, compared with less than a fourth (21 percent) of non-CAC cases. more mental health services. Sixty percent of CAC children received referrals for mental health services, compared with 22 percent in non-CAC communities. Of the CAC children referred, 31 percent were counseled onsite by a therapist specializing in the treatment of child abuse victims. 68 ful effects of children's exposure to violence. Safe Start Initiative The Safe Start initiative is a four-part project funded by OJJDP to prevent and reduce the negative impact of family and community violence on young chil\u00addren. The initiative is expanding partnerships among family- and youth-serving agencies such as early childhood education/development, health, mental health, child welfare, family support, substance abuse prevention/intervention, domes\u00adtic violence/crisis intervention, law enforcement, the courts, and legal services. Each tier of the Safe Start initiative was designed with a specific goal. Phase I expanded the system of care to children exposed to violence. Phase II is identifying what works and what doesn't in lessening and preventing the harmful effects of exposure. Phase III will build a research base of effective strategies to address children's exposure to violence. Phase IV will promote the adoption and use of these strategies across the Nation. The first phase of the initiative, the Safe Start Demonstration Project (SSDP), provided funding to 1 1 diverse sites (urban, rural, and tribal communities) and has been completed. SSDP created a comprehensive system that improved access, delivery, and quality of services for young children exposed to violence and their families. The communities expanded existing partnerships among law enforcement, mental health, domestic violence, and child welfare agencies, and family and dependency courts. An evaluation of the 11 sites conducted by the Association for the Study and Development of Communities found that four factors improve outcomes for children exposed to violence: expanding existing partnerships and implement\u00ading system-change activities, creating coordinated and comprehensive systems of care, institutionalizing system changes, and increasing community support. The second phase, the Safe Start Promising Approaches component, began in FY 2005 when OJJDP awar ded grants to 15 communities to pilot, test, and evaluate innovative intervention practices. This phase is building knowledge about the effectiveness of evidence-based, promising programs intended to reduce the harm- The RAND Corporation is conducting an OJJDP-funded outcome evaluation of this second wave of communities. Researchers are examining program out\u00ad comes, startup and implementation processes, and training needs. The results OFFICE OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION 69 ANNUAL REPOR T CHAPTER 4 will be used to develop an evidence base of promising practices and policies that yield the best outcomes for children exposed to violence and their families, and will be widely disseminated so other communities can replicate promising prac\u00adtices. The evaluation is expected to be completed in 2010. OJJDP is also funding a National Study of Children's Exposure to Violence. The research, which is being conducted by the University of New Hampshire's Crimes Against Children Research Center, is examining a number of issues including: How rates of exposure to violence vary across demographic characteristics such as gender, race, age, and family structure. The characteristics of individual cases of violence exposure, such as the severity of the event and the child's relationship to the perpetrator. The extent to which children disclose incidents of violence to various indi\u00adviduals and, when applicable, the nature and source of assistance or treat\u00adment given to the child. OJJDP anticipates releasing the study's findings in spring 2009. OJJDP also supports the Safe Start Center, which provides training and techni\u00ad cal assistance to the Safe Start communities. Center activities include conducting national teleconferences and recruiting and developing a national database of consultants with specific technical and content expertise. The center also con\u00advenes national and regional Safe Start meetings to disseminate information to grantees, national partners, and the field.

Additional information is available on the Safe Start Center Web site at www.safestartcenter.org. Court Appointed Special Advocates Program The Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) program ensures that abused and neglected children receive culturally sensitive, effective, and timely advo\u00adcacy in dependency court hearings, ultimately resulting in their placement in safe, permanent homes. Authorized by the Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990, as amended, OJJDP administers funding to the National CASA Association, which directs that a \"court-appointed special advocate shall be available to every victim of child abuse or neglect in the United States that needs such an advocate.\" OJJDP partners with National CASA to provide funding for State 2008 CASA organizations and new program development as well as expansion, train\u00ad ing and technical assistance to CASA programs, volunteer advocates, child wel\u00adfare professionals, attorneys, judges, and social workers. National CASA also helps State CASA organizations build their capacity to pro\u00ad vide services to local programs. The program makes subgrant funds available to local programs to support court-appointed special advocates who provide advocacy for abused and neglected children in the court system. These trained volunteers, also known as guardians ad litem, serve as fact finders, monitors, facilitators, and advocates in cases where there are charges of child abuse and neglect in dependency proceedings. The National CASA Association serves as a resource center, providing support and information dissemination services. FY 2008 funding for the national grants program was nearly $8.5 million, and almost $4 million was appropriated for training and technical assistance. Cur\u00ad rently, there is a network of more than 59,000 volunteers that serve 243,000 abused and neglected children through more than 900 local program offices nationwide. Through the CASA program's annual training efforts, a total of 4,100 volunteers, program staff, board members, judges, attorneys, court person\u00adnel, social service workers, child advocates, and community volunteers attend conferences, workshops, seminars, and individual or small group sessions. In 2008, CASA provided a variety of training and technical assistance activities on topics such as program development, management, volunteer recruitment and supervision, resource development, public relations, child advocacy, court practices, legal and liability issues, case management, and data collection. Also in 2008, the CASA program responded to more than 33,355 requests for technical assistance, including 74 onsite consultations. The CASA Web site recorded more than 1.7 million visitors.

The Office also has a responsibility to provide information to help policymakers and practitioners replicate programs and strategies deemed effective on the basis of research-based criteria. During fiscal year (FY) 2008, OJJDP used a number of dissemination vehicles to fulfill this mission. The Office published statistical and research publications, highlighted throughout this Report. OJJDP research projects were discussed at several conferences. The Office also took advantage of electronic publishing and online data tools to reduce costs and release statistical information soon after it becomes available. The activities described in this chapter are helping to inform the Nation about critical juvenile justice issues and possible approaches to solving them. Sharing Research Findings OJJDP's research activities provide valuable information about many critical issues facing prac\u00adtitioners and policymakers. The Office recognizes that these findings need to be widely dissemi\u00adnated if they are to be used to improve outcomes for the Nation's children. During FY 2008, the Office shared research findings with the field through a number of online and print publications as well as conferences. OFFICE OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION 73 2008 ANNUAL REPORT Girls Study Group Bulletin Series As noted in chapter 1, OJJDP convened the Girls Study Group (GSG) in response to the rising arrest rates for female juveniles. The GSG aims through its research to gain a better understand\u00ading of the dynamics of girls' delinquency and guide policy development regarding female juve\u00adnile offenders. During FY 2008, OJJDP worked with the GSG to begin broad dissemination of the major findings from the study group's activities. OJJDP launched a new Girls' Delinquency Web page, which draws on the GSG and related resources to shed light on the nature and scope of girls' delinquency and effective strategies to address it. (More information about the Web page may be found in the \"OJJDP Web site\" section of this chapter.) In addition, OJJDP released the first two Bulletins in a series highlighting the major findings of the GSG research. Each Bulletin focuses on a specific facet of the study group's activities. Charting the Way to Delinquency Prevention for Girls provides an overview of the GSG research and the Bulletins that address each issue. This overview Bulletin, which was featured in an article in USA Today, describes how GSG developed its plan to exam\u00ad ine and respond to girls' delinquency and summarizes the findings presented in each of the other six Bulletins in the series. OJJDP is committed to providing practitioners, policymakers, and the public with timely and reliable juvenile justice information. The Office's resources include comprehensive online data systems; a Web site featuring the latest information about research, programs, and funding; an online newsletter; and a range of print and online publications. 74 Violence by Teenage Girls: Trends and Contexts describes recent trends in girls' violent offending and examines the settings in which girls commit violent crimes. Recent media accounts have described a significant rise in violent behavior among girls as a burgeoning national crisis. This Bulletin assesses the accuracy of these assertions using the best available data. Drawing on information from official arrest sources, national self\u00adreport and victimization surveys, and studies reported in the social science lit\u00ad erature, the authors examine the involvement of girls in violent activity (including whether such activity has increased relative to the increase for boys) and the contexts in which girls engage in violent behavior. The Bul\u00ad letin's findings were discussed in an article in The Atlantic Monthly magazine and other media outlets. Following are brief descriptions of the other Bulletins in the GSG series, which are planned for release in FY 2009. Resilient Girls: Factors That Protect Against Delinquency examines whether four factors\u2014the presence of a caring adult, school connectedness, school success, and religiosity\u2014can protect girls from delinquency. The publication is slated for release in January 2009. Suitability of Assessment Instruments for Delinquent Girls determines whether current risk\u00adassessment and treatment\u00adfocused instruments are appropriate for use with girls; it also provides guidance to practitioners on how to select instruments for use. Causes and Correlates of Girls' Delinquency reviews the personal, family, peer, school, and community factors that can lead to delinquency among girls. Developmental Sequences of Girls' Delinquent Behavior investigates the different patterns of delinquent behaviors in which girls become involved and pro\u00advides insight into the life pathways that lead to girls' delinquent behavior. Girls' Delinquency Programs: An Evidence\u00adBased Review examines anti\u00addelinquency programs for girls and determines whether these programs effectively intervene in delinquency trajectories. Survey of Youth in Residential Placement Bulletin Series The Survey of Youth in Residential Placement (SYRP) is the third component in OJJDP's constellation of surveys providing updated statistics on youth in cus\u00adtody in the juvenile justice system. It joins the Census of Juveniles in Residential Placement and the Juvenile Residential Facility Census, which are biennial mail surveys of residential facility administrators conducted in alternating years. OFFICE OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION CHAPTER 5 SYRP is a unique addition, gathering information directly from youth through anonymous interviews. In FY 2008, OJJDP released Introduction to the Survey of Youth in Residential Place\u00ad ment, the first in a series of Bulletins reporting on the first national SYRP . The Bulletin provides an introduction to the survey, reviewing its background, describing its design and methodology, discussing its strengths and limitations, and summarizing the research questions it answers about the population of youth in custody. The remaining Bulletins in the series, planned for release in FY 2009, will cover the development and design of the survey and provide detailed information on the youth's demographics, current and prior offenses and disposition, family and educational backgrounds, and expectations for the future. In addition, the series will describe the conditions of confinement: how youth in custody are distributed across different types of residential facilities, the structural charac\u00adteristics of the facilities, how youth are grouped in living units and programs, the physical properties of the facilities, the quality of the facility's environment, the clarity of the rules, and the methods of control and discipline. The needs of youth and the services they receive in custody also will be described.

Print publications also may be ordered online at the National Criminal Justice Reference Service (NCJRS) Web site, at www.ncjrs.gov/app/publications/alphalist. NIJ Conference The 2008 National Institute of Justice (NIJ) conference brought together Federal, State, and local criminal justice scholars, policymakers, and practitioners to share the latest information on research findings and technological advances. At the conference, OJJDP organized a panel on youth gang research and best practices, \"Ganging Up on Youth Gangs: Best Practices To Shut Them Down.\" The panel summarized evaluation findings and lessons learned from two youth gang research projects: Evaluation of the Gang\u00adFree Schools and Communities Initiative and Evaluation of OJJDP's Gang Reduction Program. Presenters also discussed Best Practices To Address Community Gang Problems: OJJDP's Comprehensive Gang Model, a new OJJDP publication developed by the National Youth Gang Center. OJJDP Administrator Robert Flores served as moderator. 2008 75 ANNUAL REPOR T 76 OFFICE OF JUVENILE Online Resource www.asc41.com. Over the past few years, OJJDP and NIJ have supported programs and research to address the issue of commercial sexual exploitation of children and to under\u00adstand how law enforcement and victim service agencies are responding to it. OJJDP staff moderated a panel entitled \"Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (CSEC): Pathways and Prosecution.\" Panelists discussed risk factors, prevention, early intervention and prosecutorial efforts, as well as findings from a focus group of practitioners who work with sexually exploited youth. Online Resource For additional information about the conference, visit www.ojp.usdoj.gov/nij/events/nij_ conference/2008/agenda.htm. ASC Annual Meeting At the 60th annual American Society of Criminology (ASC) conference in St. Louis, MO, in November, OJJDP announced the public release of more than a decade of data from the agency's juvenile corrections data collections. The data\u2014available for the first time to the general research community\u2014will pro\u00advide critical information to State and national researchers who are investigating and seeking answers to major policy and practice questions in juvenile justice and disseminating those findings to the field. The data collection released included the Census of Juveniles in Residential Placement (CJRP) (1997-2006) and the Juvenile Residential Facility Census (JRFC) (2000-2004). CJRP provides detailed information on all juveniles in resi\u00addential facilities in the United States, including gender, date of birth, race, most serious offense charged, court adjudication date, admission date, and security status. JRFC collects information on how facilities operate and the services they provide, including detailed information on facility security, crowding, injuries and deaths in custody, facility ownership, operation, and services. To highlight the utility of these data files, OJJDP and the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data led a panel presentation at the conference. The panel included a historical overview of the data collections and the steps taken to prepare the files for public dissemination. Presenters from the National Center for Juvenile Justice and George Mason University provided examples of how researchers can use the data in these files to answer key policy questions in the field of juvenile justice. For more information on the ASC annual conference, go to the ASC Web site at JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION 77 2008 ANNUAL REPORT CHAPTER 5 Statistical Briefing Book OJJDP has primary responsibility for developing and disseminating statistical information on the juvenile justice system and does so through several mecha\u00adnisms. OJJDP funds the National Juvenile Court Data Archive, which provides information about cases handled by courts with juvenile jurisdiction. OJJDP established the Archive at the National Center for Juvenile Justice (NCJJ) to pro\u00advide automated juvenile court data sets. NCJJ produces several annual statistical reports for OJJDP based on Archive data and manages the content for the Statis\u00adtical Briefing Book (SBB) on OJJDP's Web site. SBB provides a wealth of information for practitioners, policymakers, the media, and the public. This online tool has current statistics about juvenile crime and victimization and about youth involved in the juvenile justice system. SBB is especially reliable because data are continually updated, ensuring that users receive timely information. The site includes a Frequently Asked Questions sec\u00adtion, publications, data analysis tools, and national data sets. SBB has become a primary source of information on juvenile crime and juvenile justice for individ\u00aduals in the United States and throughout the world. During FY 2008, there were nearly 700,000 visits to the Statistical Briefing Book and more than 2.1 million page views on the site. SBB uses Easy Access, a family of Web\u00adbased data analysis tools developed for OJJDP by NCJJ to give a larger audience access to recent, detailed information on juvenile crime and the juvenile justice system. The Easy Access applications provide informa\u00adtion on national, State, and county population counts, as well as information on homicide victims and offenders, juvenile court case processing, and juvenile offenders in residential placement facilities. During FY 2008, OJJDP added the application, Easy Access to NIBRS: Victims of Domestic Violence, which allows users to analyze State\u00adlevel data on victims of domestic violence based on information collected by the Federal Bureau of Investigation's National Incident\u00adBased Reporting System (NIBRS). With this application, users can explore the characteristics of domestic violence victims, including demographic information on the victim (age, sex, and race), victim injury, and the victim\u00adoffender relationship. Data are based on incidents reported in 2004 from law enforcement agencies in 24 States. The Juvenile Court Statistics, 2003-2004 report was also added to SBB in FY 2008. Developed and produced by NCJJ, the report is one of the Nation's oldest justice statistical publications, dating back to 1929. This edition profiles more than 1.6 million delinquency cases handled by courts with juvenile jurisdiction in 2003 and 2004 and focuses on cases involving juveniles charged with law violations (delinquency or status offenses). The data used in the analyses were contributed by nearly 1,900 courts that had jurisdiction over more than 77 percent of the U.S. juvenile population in 2004. OJJDP also produced and added three new Fact Sheets to SBB based on data from the Juvenile Court Statistics report: Delinquency Cases in Juvenile Courts, 2004; Drug Offense Cases in Juvenile Courts, 1985-2004; and Petitioned Status Offense Cases in Juvenile Courts, 2004.

JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION 81 ANNUAL REPOR T CHAPTER 5 OJJDP PUBLICATION FEATURED IN New YOrk Times EDITORIAL The information provided in a recent OJJDP Bulletin is helping inform much-needed public discussion and policy decisions on the transfer of juvenile offenders to adult criminal courts. In August, the OJJDP Bulletin, Juvenile Transfer Laws: An effective Deterrent to Delinquency? was highlighted in a New York Times editorial underscoring the value of specialized courts for young people. The author of the Bulletin cited numerous studies demonstrating higher recidivism rates for juveniles convicted in criminal court than for similar offenders adjudicated in juvenile courts. The report indicated that the research is less clear in regard to whether transfer laws deter potential juvenile offenders. inform much-needed public discussion and policy decisions on Charting the Way to Delinquency Prevention for Girls (GSG Bulletin). Describes how OJJDP's Girls Study Group worked to understand and respond to girls' delinquency and summarizes the other Bulletins in the series. NCJ 223434. Delinquency Cases in Juvenile Courts, 2004 (Fact Sheet). Presents statistics on delinquency cases processed between 1995 and 2004 by U.S. courts with juve\u00ad nile jurisdiction. The number of delinquency cases handled by juvenile courts decreased 7 percent during the time frame covered by this Fact Sheet. FS 200801. Drug Offense Cases in Juvenile Courts, 1985-2004 (Fact Sheet). Provides data on delinquency cases involving drug offenses handled between 1985 and 2004 by U.S. courts with juvenile jurisdiction. In 2004, U.S. juvenile courts handled an estimated 193,700 delinquency cases in which a drug offense was the most seri\u00adous charge. FS 200803.

OFFICE OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION 83 2008 ANNUAL REPOR T CHAPTER 5 JUVENILES IN CUSTODY Since OJJDP's inception, an important part of its information dissemination role has been to gather and report data on youth held in public and private juvenile custody facilities. The Census of Juveniles in Residential Placement (CJRP) and the Juvenile Residential Facility Census (JRFC), administered by OJJDP in alternate years, provide comprehensive data on juveniles in custody and the facilities that house them. In addition, the Survey of Youth in Residential Placement asks youth about their background and experiences. This section highlights key findings primarily from the 2006 CJRP and briefly summarizes information on deaths of juveniles in custody. Characteristics of the Juvenile Custody Population The biennial CJRP provides a 1-day \"snapshot\" of youth held in public and private juvenile detention and correctional facilities, including offense, gender, race, age, and other data. The following highlights are primarily from the census conducted on February 22, 2006. Overview Nearly 93,000 youth\u2014295 per 100,000 youth in the general population\u2014were held in juvenile residential placement facilities on the 2006 census date. Of this number, 88,137 were held for delinquency offenses, and 4,717 for status offenses. About a third of the youth in custody had been placed in a facility by a juvenile court judge because they had committed a person offense, and about a quarter had committed a property offense. The most common delinquent offenses were assault and burglary. The most common status offense was ungovernability. For most offenses, fe wer juveniles were held in 2006 than in 2001. Gender and Age Although males dominate the juvenile custody population, the female proportion has grown over the years. Nearly 14,000 female juvenile offenders were in custody on the 2006 census date\u2014comprising 15 percent of all offenders held. Between 1997 and 2006, the number of female juveniles in custody decreased 2 percent, compared with 13 percent for males. The number of female delinquent offenders increased 9 percent while the number of male delinquent offenders decreased 13 percent. The number of status offenders in custody decreased 40 percent for females, and 23 percent for males. Female juvenile offenders in custody tend to be a bit younger than their male counterparts. In 2006, juveniles age 15 or younger accounted for 42 percent of females in custody, compared with 32 percent of males. The most common age was 16 for both females and males.

Print publications also may be ordered online at the National Criminal Justice Reference Service (NCJRS) Web site, at www.ncjrs.gov/app/publications/alphalist. 84 OFFICE OF JUVENILE Race Nonwhite youth account for the majority of juveniles in custody. More than 60,000 minority youth were held in custody on the 2006 census date\u2014representing 65 percent of all offenders held, with black youth accounting for 40 percent of the juvenile custody population. Nationally, the custody rate was highest for black youth and lowest for Asian youth. For every 100,000 black juveniles living in the United States, 767 were in custody in a juvenile facility on the 2006 census date; the rate was 540 for American Indians, 326 for Hispanic youth, 170 for Whites, and 85 for Asians. The overall juvenile custody population decreased 11 percent between 2001 and 2006. The decline for white youth was 21 percent, double the rate of minority youth, which declined by 8 percent. Deaths in Custody OJJDP's latest data indicate that deaths of juveniles in custody remain relatively rare. According to the 2006 JRFC, 16 youth died while in custody at juvenile facilities, compared with 27 in 2004. Accidents were the leading cause of death in 2006, accounting for 10 deaths. Four deaths resulted from suicide, one death from an illness/natural cause, and one death from a homicide. As in 2004, death rates were generally higher at private facilities than at public facilities. Online Resources Most of the data in this section were taken from OJJDP's online Statistical Briefing Book (discussed earlier in this chapter). Detailed information on juvenile corrections is also available in Juvenile Offenders and Victims: 2006 National report. The custody chapter of the National report includes detailed information about detained and committed juvenile offenders, residents' time in placement, security features of facilities, overcrowding, substance abuse screening, and sexual violence in facilities.
