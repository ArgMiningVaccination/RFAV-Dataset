The smell of BBQ and the laughter of friends floating from neighborhood to neighborhood; the excitement of grand finales sparkling in the night sky. Independence Day is a reminder we're all in this together, as we share in holiday traditions from Honolulu to Anchorage to Miami, and the Fourth of July staples of good food and good friends are what our family is all about. We like to say Happy Birthday America with the juiciest U.S.-raised, lifetime-grazed beef your party menu ever dreamed of! It was a long road to finding it, but we finally did, and in time for the biggest BBQ day of the year. When we set out on our search for 100% pasture-raised beef, we knew two things: 1. It needed to be from a U.S. producer, which is no easy task because lifetime-grazed beef in America is usually imported. 2. It needed to pass our naturally-raised meat standard, which at its bare bones minimum is higher than other \"natural\" standards and always means: NO hormones, NO antibiotics, NO animal by-products and NO inhumane treatment of animals. Our search was rewarded when we discovered the Midwest- based Thousand Hills Cattle Company. Unlike \"grass fed,\" which has become a happy-go-lucky, anybody can use it, kind of term, the cattle of Thousand Hills spend their entire lives on pasture, producing meat rich in nutrients and better for the planet. Now we have a variety of cuts and grinds in every Natural Grocers meat case, but that's not the end of the story. We've made it our mission to source ethical, U.S.- produced products to fit any preference, making it easy for you to get ready for your Fourth of July BBQ with the best beef, pork, poultry or plant-based options in town. Cleanest. Tastiest. Most affordable. We haven't forgotten about that other Fourth of July tradition either-the nostalgic comfort of sticking a hot dog, fresh with grill marks, into a bun, smothering it with condiments and letting the juices drip down our chins. But the junk that's been put into hot dogs over the years... well, it's appetite reducing to say the least. That's why we only carry hot dogs without anything artificial, with ingredients you can identify, and with all the organic condiments you need to go along side. Now we must get back to firing up the grill and setting out the party games. We hope your month is filled with deliciously nutritious food and lots of time to hang out with whoever you call family, because they're the best. Happy July, everyone!

Preheat oven to 350\u00baF and lightly grease a 9 \u00bd-inch pie plate. 2. Place the cashew pieces in a small bowl and cover with boiling water; set aside to soak. In another small bowl, cover the dates in boiling water and set aside to soak. Allow to soak for about 30 minutes before starting the next step. 3. Drain the cashews and dates. Roughly chop dates and blend with cashews in a food processor until a chunky paste forms, about 5 minutes. Add salt and vanilla and process until well combined. Add almond flour and process until dough starts to form a ball, about 2 minutes. 4. Use wet fingers to press the dough evenly into the pie plate and poke throughout with a fork. Place in the preheated oven and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the top is lightly browned, watching closely to make sure the crust does not burn. Set aside and let cool to the touch.5. To make the filling, slice all but three of the strawberries (reserve those three for the ladybug garnish). Pur\u00e9e 1 \u00bd cups of sliced strawberries in a blender or food processor, setting aside remaining strawberry slices. Measure out \u00bd cup of pur\u00e9e and mix in the gelatin. 6. Pour remaining strawberry pur\u00e9e into a small saucepan and warm over medium-high heat until steaming but not boiling, about 2 minutes. Turn off burner and add strawberry-gelatin mixture and mix until the gelatin is dissolved and no lumps remain. 7. Mix the strawberry mixture with the ice cream in a medium mixing bowl until the ice cream is melted. Place in the refrigerator to chill for about 10 minutes. 8. Remove the filling from the refrigerator and whisk to mix thoroughly. Fold in remaining strawberry slices, and smooth into the pie crust. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, or until completely set.INSTRUCTIONSPrep: 50 min. | Cook: 20 min. | Total: 130 min.INGREDIENTS For the crust 1 cup cashew pieces \u00bd cup pitted dates \u00bc teaspoon salt 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 cup almond flour For the filling 1 pound ripe strawberries, washed and stems removed, 3 set aside for the ladybug garnish 4 teaspoons gelatin 1 pint vanilla ice cream (or dairy-free alternative) For the ladybug garnish Visit naturalgrocers.com/recipe for more details RETRO STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM PIE Somewhere along the Pacific Coast Highway in California, a weathered farm stand sits in the middle of strawberry fields. Sunlit waves crash against the rocks, and the air is salty fresh as you make your way through the red screen door. After you've taken your pick of berry treats, you pay the honor till where the cash drawer is always open, and you can feel the happiness of this place wrap itself around you like a tangible thing. It's a feeling I get whenever I'm indulging in a berry snack, even if I can't go wandering the PCH, because if berries were an emotion, this is what they would be... happiness. They pile up on your table in red, blue, and purple heaps, staining your fingers as you dig in. It's hard to pick your favorite so you taste them all again. Which is exactly what your body wants you to do, because the variety of colors that make berries so enticing come from powerful phytochemicals called anthocyanins, and they're jammed with benefits. Thanks to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity, anthocyanins and other compounds in berries have been shown to lower LDL cholesterol, improve insulin sensitivity, and boost memory function. The conclusion of a research paper examining a range of clinical studies on berries and human health sums it up this way: \"...the consumption of berries should be extensively encouraged as part of a cardioprotective diet.\" This is happy-making news if we ever heard it, because what's not to love about eating more of the most delicious fruit on the planet? For all the sunshiny feelings that berries deliver, there's a shadow looming large in the shape of conventional farming methods. Strawberries have topped the Environmental Working Group's Dirty Dozen list multiple times. Compared to other produce sampled, there was an average of 7.7 different pesticide residues found per strawberry versus 2.3 on other fruits and veggies, including some known hormone disruptors and possible carcinogens. On the bright side, one study found that just a week of organic eating can reduce pesticide build up in the body by 90 percent. As the sun sticks around for long July evenings, and a lot of us are enjoying vacation time, happiness seems to float on the air. Why not snack on it too? Swap out your sugar cravings for the fiber-rich goodness of berries. Pop in a handful of organic decadence, and listen closely, for you just might hear Ella Fitzgerald crooning in the shadows, because it's \"summertime, and the livin' is easy...\" References available upon request.BERRIESFOR THE LOVE OF ORGANICS: By Charity Isely JULY | 2018 | ISSUE 14 5 good4u HEALTH HOTLINEThe magical mineral magnesium is essential to human life. It plays a central role in almost every bodily process and is a cofactor in more than 300 enzyme systems, making it a key player in numerous biochemical reactions in the body, including muscle and nerve function; reproduction; blood pressure regulation; DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis; and cellular energy production. We cannot survive without it, yet around 50 percent of the population has an inadequate intake, putting a considerable number of people at risk for/uni00A0de ciency. According to research published in the BMJ Journal, hunter and gatherer societies of the Paleolithic era consumed a diet containing about 600 milligrams of magnesium per day, a number that far exceeds the average daily magnesium intake of today, which is approximately 270 milligrams a day for a 150-pound person. Not only is the modern intake of magnesium much lower than those of our ancestors, but it's also lower than the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of magnesium, which is between 300 and 420 milligrams for most people (and many experts believe these amounts simply prevent an outright de ciency and are not adequate for optimal health).MIND/hyphen.caseBLOWING BENEFITS OF MAGNESIUM Dr. Josh Axe, DNM, DC, CNS 6 NATURAL GROCERS NATURALGROCERS.COMMAGNESIUM DEFICIENCY SYMPTOMS Some of the most common symptoms of magnesium de ciency include: Leg cramps and restless leg/uni00A0syndrome Insomnia Fatigue, low energy, and/uni00A0weakness Anxiety, irritability, and nervousness Depression Muscle pain High blood pressure Type-2 diabetes Migraine headaches Constipation Weakened bones/osteoporosis It's important to note that some people are at a greater risk of magnesium de ciency than others. This includes people with gastrointestinal problems who aren't able to absorb magnesium properly; people with type-2 diabetes; the elderly; and people struggling with alcohol dependence. Also, people who aren't eating enough magnesium-rich foods may not be getting enough of this important nutrient in their diet.STRESS AND ANXIETY RELIEF. Are stress and anxiety recurring themes in your life? Magnesium may be the \"chill pill\" you need. Magnesium plays a role in regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis), our stress response system, and de ciencies in the mineral have been shown to induce anxiety and HPA axis dysregulation in an animal model. Indeed, anxiety is one of the physical symptoms of a magnesium de ciency. In humans, magnesium can suppress the release of the stress hormones cortisol and adrenaline and work at the blood-brain barrier to possibly prevent stress hormones from entering the brain. NEUROPLASTICITY. The brain's ability to change is neuroplasticity. This fl exibility allows our brains to forge new neural connections (synapses) and a ects learning, memory, behavior, and general cognitive function. Neuroplasticity plays a fundamental role in how well our brains age, with a loss in plasticity resulting in a loss of cognitive function. Research on neuroplasticity is growing and scientists are discovering that increasing neuronal cell magnesium levels can increase synapse density and plasticity, improving overall cognitive function. It is also showing promise to help \"rewire\" the brain in cases of traumatic brain injury and anxiety disorders. But not just any magnesium supplement will do\u2014magnesium L-threonate is the form used in studies because it has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier to e ectively increase magnesium levels in the brain. ATTENTION AND FOCUS. As you're probably coming to understand, magnesium is essential for healthy brain and nervous system function; this also includes attention and focus. Some of the symptoms of magnesium de ciency can manifest as irritability, restlessness, a lack of concentration, and fatigue, also symptoms associated with attention de cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Studies have consistently found that children diagnosed with ADHD are de cient in magnesium and that supplementation Magnesium also interacts with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, helping to maintain normal transmission of this calming neurotransmitter, while balancing levels of glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter. ANTI/hyphen.caseINFLAMMATORY. Research shows that increasing magnesium intake may also reduce infl ammation, an immune response that can contribute to a laundry list of health problems and chronic diseases, including anxiety and depression. Studies have shown that both children and adults who consume less than the RDA of magnesium are, on average, twice as likely to have elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a strong indicator of infl ammation, compared to those who consume the RDA. A study published in The Journal of Immunology found that magnesium has a modulatory e ect on the immune system and is able to reduce infl ammatory cytokine production. This means that consuming more magnesium can help to reduce the infl ammatory factors that can lead to/uni00A0disease. CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH. Magnesium plays a multitude of important roles in maintaining cardiovascular health, and many of the more severe symptoms of magnesium de ciency are cardiovascular in nature, including sudden cardiac death. Magnesium supports healthy blood pressure, reduces the risk of atherosclerosis, maintains healthy endothelial function and vasodilation, and is required for normal heart contraction and energy production in the heart. The authors of a review published earlier this year in the journal Open Heart, concluded that, \"subclinical magnesium de ciency likely leads to hypertension, arrhythmias, arterial calci cations, atherosclerosis, heart failure, and an increased for thrombosis. This suggests that subclinical magnesium de ciency is a principal, yet under-recognized, driver of cardiovascular disease. A greater public health e ort is needed to inform both the patient and clinician about the prevalence, harms, and diagnosis of subclinical magnesium/uni00A0de ciency.\" 1 2 3 4 5Mg Magnesium12 24.305MAGNESIUM'S HEALTH BENEFITS/uni00A0 JULY | 2018 | ISSUE 14good4u HEALTH HOTLINE 7good4u HEALTH HOTLINEMAGNESIUM DEFICIENCY IS WIDE SPREAD There are so many people in the U.S. and around the world su ering from magnesium de ciency, and even worse, they don't even know it. Magnesium de ciency can be present despite normal serum magnesium levels because only one percent of magnesium in your body is found in your bloodstream\u2014 most is found in your bones, muscles, and inside cells. So even though your magnesium levels may appear \"normal\" on paper, you may, in fact, be dealing with a/uni00A0de ciency. CAUSES There are a number of reasons why magnesium de ciency is a widespread problem today: Soil degradation has drastically lowered the magnesium content in our food; the modern Western diet is loaded with processed foods that contain little to no magnesium and other important micronutrients; the heavy consumption of phosphorous-containing soft drinks depletes magnesium; common digestive issues hinder the absorption of minerals; and medication use also reduces the absorption of magnesium. These reasons make it necessary for most people to supplement their diets with/uni00A0magnesium. BEST SUPPLEMENTAL FORMS Magnesium supplements in citrate, chelate, glycinate, and chloride forms are better absorbed than those in oxide or sulfate forms. It's important to note that taking magnesium supplements in high doses can have a laxative e ect, so aim to have no more than 300 to 400 milligrams in one dose. As previously mentioned, if your goal is to increase brain plasticity, magnesium L-threonate is the best choice. MAGNIFICIENT MAGNESIUM OIL & BATH SALTS Another option for increasing your magnesium levels is to use magnesium oil. Magnesium oil is applied topically so that it can be absorbed into the skin. There are a few ways to use magnesium oil: It can be sprayed directly on the skin after you take a shower, massaged into the skin to reduce muscle cramps and soreness, or added to your bath water. Another form of magnesium that you can easily use at home is Epsom salt, which is a mineral compound of magnesium and sulfate. I recommend adding Epsom salt to warm bath water and soaking in it for at least 20 minutes. This will help to boost magnesium levels, reduce infl ammation, ease stress, and relieve/uni00A0constipation. Magnesium is one of the most important minerals in the body and is needed to maintain optimal health, but an alarming number of people are at risk of a de ciency. If necessary, I suggest increasing your intake of magnesium-rich foods and turning to supplements\u2014oral and/or topical\u2014to ensure that you are getting enough of this vital nutrient and enjoying the health bene ts that come with optimal/uni00A0levels.

How's that for instant grati cation? And what better time to start than summer when there is an abundance of fresh produce to choose/uni00A0from? At Natural Grocers, we've long recommended 3-6 cups of vegetables a day, and many studies support this recommendation to gain optimal health bene ts. If you're new to eating veggies, don't let the goal of 3-6 cups a day intimidate you. Start with what you know you like. If you like cucumbers and green beans, great! Eat them. Every day. Then take a cue from the professionals! Because we know dietary changes can be hard, we asked our nutrition professionals for their favorite ways to eat more/uni00A0veggies.By Heather Pratt, MNT, BCHNDIET STRATEGIES TO INCREASE HEALTH AND HAPPINESS 12 As important as it is to eat your veggies, it is equally important how those vegetables are grown. Many people don't realize that testing has found 230 di erent pesticides and pesticide residues on conventionally grown produce, and a single food can have up to 20 di erent pesticides, many of which can't be washed or peeled away. All of those health bene ts that come from eating vegetables may just be null and void when you ingest a plethora of pesticides with them! Choosing organically grown vegetables minimizes exposure to these harmful pesticides and herbicides that have been linked with lower IQ and ADHD in growing children, kidney and liver damage, oxidative stress, certain cancers, Alzheimer's disease, and increased antibiotic resistance. In one study, adults who switched to organic had 96 percent fewer pesticide breakdown products in their urine after just one week! This bene ts you, your children, and farmers and farm workers who may be exposed to these/uni00A0chemicals.

And yes, you'll even be reaping bene ts for your future self, but don't tell your today self, just let them be happy. BONUS TIPRoast a large batch of vegetables to keep in the refrigerator for easy access through the week\u2014 try sweet potatoes, beets, carrots, caulifl ower, and/or broccoli. Warm or cold, roasted veggies are delicious additions to salads and grain bowls, served with fried or scrambled eggs for a quick breakfast, or eaten as a simple/uni00A0side. Aim to eat at least one large salad with a variety of veggie toppings every day. And while we're talking salads, think outside of the lettuce box\u2014try shredded cabbage topped with mint, cilantro, peppers, and cashews; chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, and fresh herbs; or thinly shaved fennel topped with slices of your favorite citrus fruit. There are many ways to eat salad, and it doesn't always have to include/uni00A0lettuce. Love pizza? Load it up with veggie toppings and after it has baked, add a heaping pile of arugula tossed in lemon juice and olive oil. Better yet, substitute your regular pizza crust for a caulifl ower one! Keep your fridge stocked with sauerkraut and other fermented vegetables\u2014they make easy, no-prep sides and snacks and are great toppings for sandwiches, wraps, and/uni00A0salads. Sometimes a good sauce or dip is the key. Try bu alo sauce drizzled on roasted caulifl ower, marinara sauce dolloped over saut\u00e9ed zucchini and eggplant, your favorite salad dressings repurposed as a veggie dressing (chopped celery mixed with blue cheese is a favorite), or pesto and hummus for raw veggie/uni00A0dipping. \"Hide\" veggies like chopped spinach or kale, shredded carrots, shredded zucchini, or nely minced mushrooms in meatloaf, taco meat, burgers, or spaghetti/uni00A0sauce. Serve any type of entr\u00e9e (chicken, steak, pork, sh) over a big bed of greens lightly dressed with a dressing of your/uni00A0choice. Keep your pantry and freezer stocked with canned and frozen veggies so you'll always have a quick and easy option on hand; just heat, season with sea salt and pepper, and add a healthy fat like grass-fed butter or coconut/uni00A0oil. Get creative with veggie substitutes like zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash, eggplant lasagna, and caulifl ower rice and pizza/uni00A0crust. Don't forget about veggies at breakfast! Try saut\u00e9ed vegetables with eggs, nely shredded carrot and/or zucchini in pancakes or oatmeal, or even your favorite veggie-loaded lunch or dinner as your rst meal of the/uni00A0day. 2 6 JULY | 2018 | ISSUE 1411 good4u HEALTH HOTLINEAll items are available while supplies last; no rain checks.

MORE EVIDENCE ON THE BLOOD PRESSURE BENEFITS OF BEETROOT Two new studies support the use of beetroot to lower blood pressure and improve blood vessel tone\u2014that is, the ability to flex instead of stiffen. Vania Margaret Flosi Paschoalin, PhD, of the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, and her colleagues, tested nitrate-rich beetroot juice on five healthy subjects. The juice was processed into the form of a gel. One hour after consuming the gel, systolic blood pressure decreased by 6.2 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure decreased by 5.2 mm Hg. In addition, heart rate decreased by seven beats per minute. In the other study, Shanti Velmurugan, MBBS, PhD, of Queen Mary University of London, and her colleagues, gave nitrate beetroot juice or nitrate-depleted beetroot juice daily to 69 people who had elevated cholesterol levels, but were otherwise healthy. The daily amount of juice was 250 mL, or about 8.5 fluid ounces. By the end of the six-week study, people taking the nitrate-rich beetroot juice had about a 24 percent improvement in blood vessel tone, as measured by a technique known as ultrasound flow-mediated dilation. In contrast, people taking the nitrate- depleted beetroot juice had about a 6.6 percent decrease in blood vessel tone. At the same time, people taking nitrate-rich beetroot juice had a 7.6 decrease in platelet aggregation, a sign of improved cardiovascular risk. References available upon request.GABA, or gamma-aminobutyric acid, is both an amino acid and neurotransmitter. As a supplement, GABA has been shown to reduce anxiety, ease psychological stress, and promote a sense of relaxation. In a new study, Japanese researchers tested the effects of a natural form of GABA on 32 Japanese adults. Most of the subjects worked in offices and were in generally good health. Ten other subjects with sleep problems were also included in the study. \"It has been reported that over 20 percent of adults in Japan suffer from insomnia,\" the researchers wrote. The study was a crossover design, so all of the subjects received, at one time or another, 200 mg of GABA or placebo 30 minutes before bed. Blood levels of GABA peaked 30 minutes after taking the supplement, and brain wave activity was monitored with electroencephalography. GABA shortened sleep latency, the time from being fully awake to being asleep. In addition, GABA increased the length of non-REM sleep. Non-REM sleep stages are considered to be the deepest and most restful stages. In contrast, these aspects of sleep deteriorated when the subjects took placebos. Two new studies highlight the benefits of taking omega-3 fish oils to reduce the risk of depression and mental decline. Chika Horikawa, RD, and her colleagues at the National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Japan, studied 1,050 men and 1,073 women age 40 years or older. They measured the subjects' blood levels of omega-3 and omega-6 fats and also assessed whether they suffered from depression. People with the highest levels of omega-3s had a 36 to 45 percent lower risk of developing depression, and those with the highest levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) specifically were 42 percent less likely to be depressed. In a separate study, researchers from Wageningen University, Netherlands, and Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, investigated the relationship between consuming fish rich in omega-3s and cognitive decline. The study focused on 915 men and women, with an average age of 81 years. People in the study were tracked for five years, and none showed significant signs of cognitive decline when the study began. People with a high intake of fish rich in omega-3s showed a slower decline in semantic memory, which refers to recall of verbal information. They also had a slower decline in perceptual speed, which involves comparing letters, objects, and patterns. The benefits of fish rich in omega-3s were even stronger among the 178 people who carried the APOE-4 gene, which is associated with a greater risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Cranberry juice is often used to lower the risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Such alternatives to antibiotics may be particularly important, given the increase in antibiotic resistance. A new study clearly demonstrates that cranberry juice is far more effective than placebos in preventing UTIs. Kevin C. Maki, PhD, of Bioforte Clinical Research in Addison, Illinois, studied 373 women with a recent history of UTIs. They averaged 40 years of age. Half were asked to consume about 240 mL (8.1 fluid ounces) of a cranberry juice drink, and half drank a placebo daily for 24 weeks. By the end of the study, women in the group consuming cranberry juice had 39 UTIs and women in the placebo group had 67 UTIs. That translated to a 39 percent lower risk of UTIs with daily cranberry consumption. The benefits of cranberries have been attributed to A-type proanthocyanidins, a type of antioxidant that prevents bacteria from adhering to the urinary tract.

In a bowl whisk together the kombucha, coconut aminos (or tamari), honey, garlic, apple cider vinegar, and chili paste until well combined. 2.
