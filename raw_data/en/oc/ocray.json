Dietary Treatments to Improve Insulin Sensitivity: Focus on High-Amylose Maize Starch Monday, 6:30 AM - 8:30 AM McCormick Place Convention Center, S105BCD Sponsored by Ingredion Inc Clinical trials demonstrate that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between consumption of high-amylose maize (HAM) starch andreduced risk of type 2 diabetes. Replacing digestible starch with type 2 resistant starch from HAM (HAM-RS2) leads to a reduction in glycemia and has led to an approved EU Health Claim. Further, consumption ofHAM-RS2 has been shown to have a positive effect on insulin sensitivity,leading to a recently approved health claim by the FDA for diabetes prevention. This session will review data from clinical trials and inter- individual variations in the metabolic response to HAM-RS2.
