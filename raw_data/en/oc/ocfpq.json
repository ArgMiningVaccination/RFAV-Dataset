Also, HSA and FSA cards can NOT be used for online orders) Thyro-Adrenal Support Complex A comprehensive support formula. Includes top quality thyroid glandular, tyrosine (which is a precursor for thyroid hormones), herbals and nutrients shown to support thyroid function as well as adrenal herbals to balance the adrenal thyroid interaction. The typical dosage that I recommend to patients is 2 capsules every morning, with or without food. This product can be started right away during week 1 and taken on-going. Dr. Aieta's 2-Week Detox Protocol Most detox or cleanse kits contains harsh laxatives and other suspect products. My detox protocol uses a gentle laxative, a tasteless fiber supplement to bind up toxins from the GI tract and provide satiety so one eats a little less and a well rounded liver detox product that also supports the gallbladder, kidneys and lymphatic system. Directions: Tri-Mag (Laxative Formula): Day 1 through 7: Three tablets at bedtime with 8 ounces of water. Day 8 through 14: Two tablets at bedtime with 8 ounces of water. Reduce dosage if you experience abdominal discomfort or diarrhea (you may only require 1-2 tablets opposed to 2 or 3). If discomfort persists, discontinue use. Fiber Detox: For 14 days, Mix 1 scoop into water in the morning and again at night. After drinking mixture - follow up with another glass of 8oz of water. Liver Detox Support: Day 1 through day 7: One capsule at night. Day 8 through day 14: One capsule in the morning and two at night. [Dr. Aieta's Two Week Detox Protocol](https://draieta.com/shop/dr-aietas-two-week-detox-protocol/) will contain enough products for 2-3 more two week detoxes. Dr. Aieta recommends doing his [two week detox](https://draieta.com/shop/dr-aietas-two-week-detox-protocol/) every 3 months or at every change of season for optimal health.
