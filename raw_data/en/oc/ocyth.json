Below is an example of a severe skin allergy suffered by a 10-year-old Yellow Lab mix. This 10-year-old dog had been fed a popular corn-based prescription diet dog food for six weeks old with no ill effects. She suddenly developed a severe skin condition (pictured). We immediately changed her diet to a lamb and rice formula dog food (available at [our clinic](https://cascadeanimal.com/about-cascade-animal-clinic/)) and treated the skin topically with a Malaseb product (available at [our clinic](https://cascadeanimal.com/about-cascade-animal-clinic/)). The dog's skin healed nearly overnight and regained a healthy coat within a few weeks. Acupuncture and Holistic Care [Acupuncture](https://cascadeanimal.com/pet-acupuncture-springfield-or/) and holistic medicines are provided to our clients who prefer an alternative healthcare method and treatments for their pets. Modern research shows that acupoints are located in areas with a high density of free nerve endings, mast cells, small arterioles, and lymphatic vessels. Most acupoints are motor points. Many studies indicate that stimulation of acupoints induces the release of beta-endorphin, serotonin, and other neurotransmitters. These scientific studies support acupuncture for pain relief. [Dr. Rosen has offered acupuncture for over 15 years.](https://cascadeanimal.com/pet-acupuncture-springfield-or/) Lab & Equipment [Our clinic](https://cascadeanimal.com/about-cascade-animal-clinic/) is equipped with an on-site medical lab, complete with blood chemistry analyzers, blood cell counter, diagnostic x-ray equipment, and EKG machines. Surgery Our surgical unit handles procedures ranging from minor injuries and afflictions to significant chest and bone surgery. We practice the safest and most current anesthesia procedures, utilizing blood pressure monitors and blood oxygen monitors. Laser surgery is recommended in most cases. Laser Surgery Laser technology has proven to be a useful tool in human medicine for over 20 years. [Cascade Animal Clinic](https://cascadeanimal.com/about-cascade-animal-clinic/) is excited to be among the few veterinary hospitals in the Springfield/Eugene area that offer laser surgery for pets. The benefits of laser surgery are numerous. The laser simultaneously seals nerve endings as it cuts: without a raw severed end, the patient feels less pain post-operatively. The patient may also require fewer anesthesia units during the operation, thereby reducing the risk of complications. Bleeding is also minimized because the laser seals small blood vessels as it cuts. Additionally, swelling is reduced because the laser will not crush, tear, or bruise the tissue. The risk of infection is reduced with laser surgery because it sterilizes the surgery site as it cuts, killing the bacteria that cause disease while removing unhealthy tissue. Outdoor Area Our [clinic](https://cascadeanimal.com/about-cascade-animal-clinic/) provides services both indoors and outdoors. Our fenced yard provides our clients with a safe and clean environment to offer their pets a potty break or to relax in the garden while waiting for appointments. "}
