Better is a quest. Better is believing that, as great as today is, tomor-row is even more promising. The theme of Northwestern Medicine's Better marketing campaign is the essence of Northwestern Medicine's patients first culture. The care we provide to patients was again ranked among the highest in the nation by U.S. News & World Report. Four of our hospitals and 13 clinical care specialties were recognized by U.S. News, an achievement that further distinguishes Northwestern Medicine as Chicago's premier academic health system and underscores our commit-ment to providing world-class healthcare to our patients. Together as Northwestern Medicine, we have advanced clinical collaboration for patients like Karen Ambler. Diagnosed with leukemia last year, Karen benefited from work completed by a group of physicians, pharmacists, pathologists and members of our strategy and operations teams to develop the optimal approach to leukemia treatment. Karen's physician at North-western Medicine Delnor Hospital worked with colleagues downtown to coordinate every aspect of her care, which ultimately rendered her cancer-free. In addition to oncology, similar collabo- ration is occurring in neurosciences and cardiovascular care. These integrated clini-cal services will change the way we work together for the benefit of our patients. At the same time, we are expanding ac- cess to Northwestern Medicine so patients like Karen can receive world-class care close to home. Last year, we welcomed KishHealth and Marianjoy to our growing integrated ac-ademic health system, and we look forward to Centegra Health joining us this year. Progress also continues on several multi-year investments, including construc-tion of the new Northwestern Medicine Northwestern Medicine Leadership: A Successful Year for the Health System Lake Forest Hospital and Kishwaukee Well-ness Center as well as implementation of a unified electronic health record across the health system. Together, our achievements in fiscal year 2016 have resulted in better care for our patients, an improved working en-vironment for our physicians, nurses and staff, and the fiscal resources to invest in our future. I look forward to another successful year, and am grateful to our physicians, nurses, faculty, staff, students and trainees who make it all possible. Best, Dean M. Harrison President and CEONorthwestern Memorial HealthCareTogether, our achievements in fiscal year 2016 have resulted in better care for our patients, an improved working environment for our physicians, nurses and staff, and the fiscal resources to invest in our future. Read about the medical school's outstanding achievements in 2016 on p.15. 2 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE MAGAZINELast November, nearly 60 members of the Feinberg faculty were recognized for their benevolence to the medical school and their membership in the Nathan Smith Davis Society, which honors individuals who support the medical school through generous phi-lanthropy and volunteerism. \"The Nathan Smith Davis Society has a powerful influence, reminding us what we do here at Northwestern,\" said Eric G. Neilson, MD, vice president for Medical Affairs and Lewis Landsberg Dean. \"We are cultivating a culture of connectivity and giving back. Partici-pation should be a part of who we all are at Northwestern.\" The reception also celebrated progress made so far in the medical school's Faculty Giving Campaign. Faculty members play an essen-tial role within We Will. The Campaign for Northwestern Medicine, providing both professional and philanthropic dedication to the suc-cess of Northwestern. To date, nearly 600 faculty have participated in the campaign, making more than $2 million in total contributions to support the medical school. During the event, 11 faculty members were lauded for joining more than 100 current and emeriti faculty in the Lifetime Giving Society of the Nathan Smith Davis Society. These individuals have given a cumulative total of at least $35,000 to the medical school in their lifetimes. In recognition of this steadfast generosity, these members have nameplates displayed on desks in the Hughes Audi-torium in the Robert H. Lurie Medical Research Building. A CULTURE OF PROFESSIONALISM AND PHILANTHROPY Neil Stone, '68 MD, '74, '75 GME, the Robert Bonow, MD, Professor of Medicine at Feinberg, is an advocate for the Faculty Campaign. Stone attended Northwestern as an undergraduate and medical student as a part of the second group of students in the Honors Program in Medical Education. After training at Brigham and Wom-en's Hospital and the National Institutes of Health, he returned to Northwestern to be chief medical resident and a cardiology fellow. He then joined the faculty and has been an active member for more than 40 years. \"I support the medical school and the faculty campaign because Northwestern matters to me,\" he said. \"Northwestern Medicine is a group I love being a part of. We share enthusiasm and professional-ism, as well as an aspiration to make Northwestern even better than it is now.\"Faculty Support Northwestern's Future WRITTEN BY: Andrea Arntsen-Harris Neilson and Stone asked all faculty at the reception for ideas and advice on how to increase participation in the Faculty Cam-paign and, importantly, to engage faculty in the life of the school more overall. Peter McMenamin, '87 PT, assistant professor of Physical Therapy and Human Movement Sciences, shared his thoughts: \"We need to create a culture of 'giving back' early in one's career, no matter the size of the gift. Once established, that habit will grow together with advancing career success.\" \"Our faculty members are the heart of our medical school and are a tremendous asset to our students, trainees, their colleagues and patients,\" Neilson said. \"I know that we will fulfill the aspirations of this campaign with our faculty's full support and participa-tion. I am so grateful to the faculty members who have joined us thus far in this effort or are considering it.\" NEIL STONE, '68 MD, '74, '75 GME, AND BOYD METZGER, MD, WERE AMONG FACULTY RECOGNIZED FOR THEIR GENEROS-ITY TO THE MEDICAL SCHOOL DURING A RECENT RECEPTION. WINTER 2016-17 3CAMPUS NEWS While acting out a two-person scene during a course in medical improvisational theater, second-year medical student Owaiz Ansari de-liberately waited several seconds before responding to his classmate. \"We had to process what they were saying before responding to them. The scene became very in-depth and emotional when people had time to think about what they were going to say,\" Ansari said. Ansari said he chose to take the seminar to improve his commu- nication skills. As part of Feinberg's curriculum, medical students are required to take a five-week seminar in medical humanities through the Center for Bioethics and Medical Humanities. \"This type of activity will help me not just in patient interac- tions, but also when I start working with attendings. I'll be able to digest what I'm hearing better and take a second to think about it. And, hopefully, be able to create a clear mindset and have a goal in mind when I respond,\" Ansari said. Katie Watson, JD, associate professor of Medical Education, directs the course. \"I'm hoping students will identify, reinforce and retain the communication strengths they bring, and also identify communica-tion challenges they may have, and start improving them,\" she said. Watson first noticed overlaps between the skills required of improvisers and of physicians while completing her fellowship at Medical Improv Course Boosts Communication and Teamwork Skills WRITTEN BY: Sarah Plumridge Northwestern in bioethics and performing improv on the weekends. She tested the idea of an improv theater seminar for medical students and started the course in 2002 after receiving positive feedback. While the seminar is focused on doctor-patient communication skills, there are no specifically medical scenarios or prompts. Watson creates or modifies theatrical improv exercises that correlate with general skill sets medical students will need to use in their profession. \"I think of it as cross-training. Why does the runner do sit-ups? It doesn't look like it makes sense, but you're building a muscle in a different way,\" Watson said. During each two-hour session, students perform a few exercises around a theme, then after completing the exercises, they debrief and discuss how they can apply what they learned in medicine. In an article recently published in Annals of Internal Medicine, Watson discusses the educational benefits of the medical improv course, which including adaptability, spontaneity, deep listening, building trust and teamwork. \"When reflecting on an activity, we would say this is a situa- tion that would make sense if you were with a patient and have to think on the spot, or when you are explaining a diagnosis \u2014 it was nice to see those parallels,\" Ansari said. As the course progresses, Watson said, \"I see the students be- coming more confident, more relaxed and more quickly accessing all the information and skills they possess.\" By focusing the course on recognizing their own strengths and weaknesses, Watson can encourage students to think how they can develop their own professional identities as physicians. \"To take on the intellectual and emotional challenge of provid- ing healthcare, physicians need all of their personal and emotional resources to meet the needs of their patients,\" Watson said. I see the students becoming more confident, more relaxed and more quickly accessing all the informa-tion and skills they possess.

How does directing a \"Martian\" to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich improve healthcare communications? The answers are part of the curriculum for the first PhD in health- care quality and patient safety program in the country \u2014 at Northwest-ern Medicine \u2014 which aims to prevent the annual 440,000 deaths from medical errors in the United States. \"You can't stress enough how crazy it is that the third-leading cause of death is medical errors,\" said Donna Woods, PhD, director of the graduate programs in healthcare quality and patient safety. \"How will this ever get fixed if we don't train a work force to do it? We need an army of experts who need to know how to address this. The medical field does not have the skills to do it.\" Senior and mid-career clinicians (physicians, nurses, pharmacists) and healthcare professionals are trained by engineers, cognitive psy-chologists and risk assessment and change management specialists, who bring a critical fresh eye to the medical world. The \"outsiders\" teach students how to spot the vulnerable kinks in the system and figure out how to fix them. The students learn to do research, so they can design fixes based on scientific evidence.To build a national healthcare safety army, Northwestern has provided a template from its master's level healthcare quality and patient safety program \u2014 also the first in the country \u2014 to other medical schools to launch their own master's programs. As part of their curriculum, the PhD students learn about physi- cal and cognitive ergonomics, which is the study of predictable errors your mind can make and how to consider these in healthcare design to make the delivery of healthcare more reliable. In one class session for PhD and graduate students, a fac- ulty member who is a physician and an engineer brought EpiPen trainers to class. He asked students \u2014 most of whom had medical degrees \u2014 to hold their breath (to create a sense of urgency) while reading the directions and give another person the injection. In the scenario, the person was having a life-threatening anaphylac-tic reaction. Every time this session is held, at least one student accidentally sticks himself or herself in the hand with the injector, wasting the life-saving medicine. Students had to figure out why the device's design led to that problem. The lesson learned: It's hard to make your eyes focus when you are in a crisis situation. The faculty member who taught the EpiPen class subsequently worked with the manufacturer to develop a new design in which the injector gives spoken instructions. In another class, students are instructed to write a protocol for a \"Martian,\" who has no earthly cultural knowledge, to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. When the instructor attempts to literally follow students' directions, sandwich-making chaos en-sues. The exercise illustrates that when a person writes a protocol for a healthcare procedure, they make a lot of cultural assump-tions that not everyone shares or understands across medical departments, services and professions. That can lead to errors. First PhD Program in U.S. Trains Scientists to See, Fix Kinks in Healthcare System WRITTEN BY: Marla Paul Learn more about the new PhD program on nm.magazine.org. WINTER 2016-17 5Research Briefs Promising Biomaterial to Build Better Bones with 3-D Printing A Northwestern research team developed a 3-D printable ink that produces a synthetic bone implant able to rapidly induce bone regeneration and growth. The findings were published in Science Translational Medicine. The hyperelastic \"bone\" material, the shape of which can be easily customized, could be especially useful to treat bone defects in children. Bone implantation surgery is particularly painful and complicated for children. Often, missing bone is replaced by bone harvested from elsewhere in the body, which can lead to com-plications and pain. Metallic implants are not a permanent fix for growing children. \"Adults have more options when it comes to implants,\" said Ramille Shah, PhD, assistant professor of Surgery in the Division of Organ Transplantation, who led the research. \"Pediatric patients do not. If you give them a permanent implant, you have to do more surgeries in the future as they grow. They might face years of difficulty.\" Shah's 3-D printed biomaterial is a mix of hydroxyapatite (a cal- cium mineral found naturally in human bone) and a biocompatible, biodegradable polymer that is used in many medical applications, including sutures. Shah's hyperelastic \"bone\" material shows great promise in in vivo animal models; this success lies in the printed structure's unique properties. The material is majority hydroxyapa-tite, yet it is hyperelastic, robust and porous at the nano, micro and macro levels. \"Porosity is huge when it comes to tissue regeneration, because you want cells and blood vessels to infiltrate the scaffold,\" Shah said. \"Our 3-D structure has different levels of porosity that is advanta-geous for its physical and biological properties.\" Pinpointing the Origins of Prostate Cancer Scientists identified a protein that acts as a marker for a population of cells in the prostate with both regenera-tive and cancer-initiating potential. The study was published in Nature Communications. \"We identified the cell of origin for prostate cancer, which is very important in determining if it is an aggressive cancer or not and maybe even the treatment response,\" said senior author Sarki Abdulkadir, MD, PhD, the John T. Grayhack, MD, Professor of Urological Research. The scientists used lineage-tracing techniques in mouse models with normal prostates to show how this protein, Bmi1, identifies a population of cells resistant to castration that mimics hormonal therapy used in patients with prostate cancer. Since prostate tumors require hormones such as tes- tosterone to survive, when hormone therapy starves the cancer cells of testosterone, the cancer cells shrink. But, castration-resistant cells can cause the disease to relapse. \"There is a lot of interest in trying to understand why or how a cancer becomes castration resistant, or when a cancer doesn't respond to this treatment anymore. That is what kills most of the patients,\" Abdulkadir said. The findings suggest that some cells in the prostate are prewired to be castration resistant, so if they turn into can-cer cells, they will already be resistant to the treatment. The research was supported by National Cancer Institute grants R01CA167966 and R01CA123484, a Zell Family Scholar Professor award and the Grayhack Chair in Urological Research.More details on these studies are online at magazine.nm.org. 6 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE MAGAZINEScientists Develop Soft, Microfluidic 'Lab on the Skin' for Sweat AnalysisMuscles Have Circadian Clocks That Control Exercise Response A Northwestern research team has developed a first-of-its-kind soft, flex- ible microfluidic device that easily adheres to the skin and measures the wearer's sweat to show how his or her body is responding to exercise. A little larger than a quarter and about the same thickness, the simple, low-cost device, described in the journal Science Transla- tional Medicine, analyzes key biomarkers to help a person decide quickly if any adjustments, such as drinking more water or replenish-ing electrolytes, need to be made or if something is medically awry.Scientists have discovered circadian clocks in muscle tissue that control the muscle's metabolic response and energy efficiency depending on the time of day. The finding in mice, published in Cell Metabolism, sheds light on the time-of-day differences in muscle's ability to adapt to exercise and use oxygen for energy. Muscle cells are more efficient during an organism's normal waking hours, the study found. All cells in the body, including those in muscle, contain a clock that regulates how cells adapt to changes in the environment and activity across the 24-hour day. \"Oxygen and the internal clock are doing a dance together inside muscle cells to produce energy, and the time of day determines how well that dance is synchronized,\" said senior author Joseph Bass, MD, PhD, chief and Charles F. Kettering Professor of Endocrinology. \"The capacity for a cell to perform its most important functions, to contract, will vary according to the time of day.\" More research is needed before the finding can be translated into workout advice. The study was supported by National Institutes of Health grants R01DK090625, R01DK100814 and K01DK105137-02 from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and grant P01AG011412 from the National Institute on Aging. Lynn Sage Cancer Research Foundation and others also supported the study. Designed for one-time use of a few hours, the device, placed directly on the skin of the forearm or back, even detects the pres- ence of a biomarker for cystic fibrosis. In the future, it may be more broadly used for disease diagnosis. \"The intimate skin interface created by this wearable, skin-like microfluidic system enables new measurement capabilities not possible with the kinds of absorbent pads and sponges currently used in sweat collection,\" said John A. Rogers, PhD, professor of Neurological Surgery, who led the multi-institution research team that created the 'lab on the skin.' \"Sweat is a rich, chemical broth containing a number of impor- tant chemical compounds with physiological health information. By expanding our previously developed 'epidermal' electronics platform to include a complex network of microfluidic channels and storage reservoirs, we now can perform biochemical analysis of this impor-tant biofluid,\" he said. L'Or\u00e9al, the Frederick Seitz Materials Research Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the National Research Foundation of Korea and the National Institutes of Health (grant R01EB019337) supported the research. WINTER 2016-17 7failure later in life, a recent study suggests. \"The benefits of preventing the onset of the risk factors themselves often far exceed the benefits experienced through treatment of the risk factors after they've developed,\" said John Wilkins, MD, '12 GME, assistant professor of Medicine in the Division of Cardiol- ogy, who led the research. DOCTOR USES MAGIC TO HEAL, TEACH AND ENTERTAIN WTTW CHICAGO TONIGHT By trade, Ricardo Rosenkranz, MD, '93, '96 MD, clinical assis-tant professor of Pediatrics in Community Based Primary Care, is a neonatologist, specializing in the care of premature babies. But his other great passion is magic. \"Almost every magical ef-fect is about transformation. And so much of medicine is about transformation,\" he explained in an interview about the one-man stage show he performed this winter, \"The Rosenkranz Mysteries,\" which looked at the connection between magic and medicine. 5SURGEONS START PROGRAM TO TRAIN BYSTANDERS TO TREAT SHOOTING VICTIMS ABC NEWS A new program called the Chicago South Side Trauma First Re-sponders Course will train anyone to give lifesaving treatment to trauma victims. Mamta Swaroop, MD, '10 GME, assistant professor of Surgery in Trauma and Critical Care, joined forces with advocate group Cure Violence in the hopes that simple steps taken immediately after a shooting or other violent event can save lives before an ambulance even arrives. \"We asked people about what their experiences were with violence and with trauma,\" Swaroop said. Many said they had lived through violent events in which they had no knowledge of how to respond to traumatic injuries. \"[They] feel helpless in that situation.\" HOW DONALD TRUMP AFFECTS THERAPY PATIENTS TIME Clinical psychologist Inger Burnett-Zeigler, '09 PhD, assistant professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, described how many of her patients came to therapy with anxiety, fear and worry after the presidential election. \"It's obvious to me that this highly contested election is already having real mental health consequences. Several people who had not demonstrated overt distress prior to election night began wrestling with the question: What does this mean for me? They wondered aloud about changes in government funding priorities that might affect their job security and ability to get healthcare,\" she wrote. BEN STILLER REVEALS HE HAD PROSTATE CANCER AT AGE 48 TODAY Actor Ben Stiller shared his experience being diagnosed with prostate cancer in June 2014 after taking a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test. Edward Schaeffer, MD, chair of Urology, performed a robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatec-tomy to remove Stiller's cancer. \"The PSA test is a powerful tool that has to be used and interpreted in the right way,\" Schaeffer said. \"Whether or not to get the test should be a shared decision-making process with a man and his doctor.\" OBESITY AND DIABETES BY MIDDLE AGE TIED TO HEART FAILURE LATER ON REUTERS People who reach middle age without developing high blood pressure, diabetes or obesity may have a lower risk of heart 1 2 3 4Media SpotlightCAMPUS NEWS ACTOR BEN STILLER WITH HIS SURGEON EDWARD SCHAEFFER, MD, CHAIR OF UROLOGY, ON SET AT THE TODAY SHOW IN OCTOBER. 8 MAGAZINE.NM.ORG AS HOUSE CALLS MAKE A COMEBACK, DOCTORS NEED TO LEARN NEW SKILLS STAT Katherine O'Brien, MD, geriatric medicine fellow, and June McKoy, MD, '01 GME, associate professor of Medicine and Preventive Medicine, suggest that house calls can be an effective way to provide medical care to geriatric patients. \"If the house call is to truly make a comeback \u2014 and it should for both patient convenience and cost \u2014 training programs and the organizations that oversee them must revolutionize their curricula to help young physicians develop the skills necessary for home care medicine,\" they wrote. THE WAY YOU BREATHE MAY HELP YOUR BRAIN WORK BETTER WGN TV Inhaling activates a critical area in the brain, according to new research. \"We found that the act of breathing in increases activity in parts of the brain that are important for smell, emotion and memory. This could in part be due to the fact that when you breathe through your nose, you activate smell neurons, which activate the parts of the brain that are impor-tant for sense of smell,\" said lead author Christina Zelano, PhD, assistant professor of Neurology during a broadcast interview. A HEARING TEST MAY BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY A CONCUSSION WASHINGTON POST By measuring the brain's electrical reactions to speech sounds, researchers were able to identify children who had suffered a recent concussion with 90 percent accuracy and those who hadn't with 95 percent accuracy. \"[Auditory processing] is the 6 7 8most precise, most complicated computational work the brain has to do. So it's not surprising that auditory processing can be used as a measure of brain health,\" said Nina Kraus, '80 PhD, professor of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, who led the research. CAN PSYCHIATRIC DRUGS BLUNT THE MOTHER- BABY BOND? THE NEW YORK TIMES \"Mothers who have depression and other mental health symptoms tend to have less positive facial expressions, less verbalizations, and even engage in certain types of behaviors that don't always focus on the safety of the child in the same way,\" said Sheehan Fisher, PhD, '12 GME, professor of Psychia-try and Behavioral Sciences, in a Q&A. \"What our focus is on is how do we best treat the mother so that her symptoms don't get in the way of her being able to bond with the child and the impact that can have on the infant long-term.\" WHEN 'SUPERAGERS' GET ALZHEIMER'S, THEY DON'T EXHIBIT ANY SYMPTOMS HUFFINGTON POST The Fall 2016 issue of Northwestern Medicine Magazine featured a group of seniors in their 80s, 90s and beyond who have remarkable memory power. Now research shows that these \"SuperAgers\" can have numerous amyloid plaques in their brains \u2014 a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease \u2014 yet their memory is unaffected. \"It appears that some elderly individu-als are immune to the effects of Alzheimer's pathology,\" said neurologist Changiz Geula, PhD, research professor in the Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer's Disease Center, who conducted the new research. 9 10 WINTER 2016-17 9Eric G.

He turned to Samuel Stupp, PhD, director of Northwestern's Louis A. Simpson and Kimberly K. Querrey Institute for BioNano- technology (SQI). Stupp's laboratory had engineered molecules able to self-assemble into nanofibers thousands of times thinner than a human hair that can mimic cell structures and biological signal- ing. The technology can be used to regenerate tissues and organs spanning from bone and cartilage to muscle and brain tissues. Hsu hoped it could rebuild bone in spine therapy. \"We learned we could help each other out: apply his technol- ogy to my clinical patients,\" says Hsu, the Clifford C. Raisbeck, MD, Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery. \"You can have the best technol- ogy in the world, but if you don't know how to apply it or how to promote it, it can all be for naught.\" Spinal fusion is a surgery that \"welds\" vertebrae together in the spine so they heal into a single bone. The procedure is designed to imitate the normal healing process of broken bones and is used to eliminate pain caused by fractured bones, deformities or arthritis. During a spinal fusion procedure, a surgeon takes small pieces of bone or synthetic bone graft substitute and places them between the vertebrae to help them fuse. While advances in technology and bone grafting substitutes have improved this process, better spine fusion rates with minimal side effects are still needed. With this in mind, Hsu and his wife Erin Hsu, PhD, research assistant professor of Orthopaedic Surgery \u2014 both resident faculty in the SQI \u2014 sought to apply Stupp's novel nanofibers to spinal fusion animal models. Working together, the Stupp-Hsu team developed a new version of the nanofiber material that they believe will be a better bone graft substitute. Made from colla- gen and self-assembling nanofibers, their \"nanoslurry\" is a malleable paste that binds to the native growth factors in a patient's own body, enhancing natural healing ability. In challenging healing environments, this \"slurry\" can also deliver BMP-2, a growth factor protein critical in the regeneration of bone. The BMP-2 protein is then released over time to induce bone growth, so lower amounts of the protein are required for suc- cessful fusion, which could minimize side effects. In either iteration, this paste will allow surgeons to adapt the material to fill any size bone defect. \"We have these synthetic nanogels that we know can promote bone formation, but to work in the operating room, they have to be readily accessible and implant easily,\" Erin Hsu says. \"This slurry will allow the nanofiber gels to be used in a more universal fashion.\" Wellington Hsu adds, \"Different ap- plications for spine surgeries necessitate different characteristics of a product. Our collaborations can optimize the ability to define those characteristics, whether we want our product to be more soupy, or more like a toothpaste or more like a crouton.\" NEXT-GENERATION MATERIALS Stupp's research is based on supramo- lecular chemistry, which explores how molecules interact with each other and how they self-assemble and function. The underlying science behind the field was recognized in 1987 when Donald J. Cram, Jean-Marie Lehn and Charles J. Ped- ersen received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Samuel Stupp, PhD, director, Louis A. Simpson and Kimberly K. Querrey Institute for BioNanotech-nology Stupp spearheaded the study of \"supramolecular biomateri- als,\" self-assembling materials that can be designed to interact specifically with cells. \"What makes this field exciting is getting to use cutting-edge science \u2014 it's new for everybody \u2014 and having an impact on life span and quality of life for people,\" says Stupp, who is also a professor at Feinberg, the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, and the McCormick School of Engineering. Stupp's work focuses on developing materials that mimic the nanoscale architecture of extracellular matrices surrounding mam-malian cells. These materials have the ability to display biological signals that can interact with receptors and cause cells to migrate, proliferate or differentiate. The nanofibers that Stupp has engineered resemble collagen or fibronectin fibers, both structures of the extracellular matrix. They can be built from a combination of amino acids, nucleic acids, lipids and sugars, which allows them to degrade into nutrients for cells. The scientists believe they can incorporate any biological signal in these nanofibers to achieve a specific regenerative medicine target. FEATURE: A UNIVERSAL SOLUTION FOR REGENERATIVE MEDICINE of nanofiber that combines two kinds of polymers, those formed with covalent bonds and others formed with non-covalent bonds. The strongly bonded covalent polymer acts as a skeleton for structure and the weakly bonded non-covalent polymer forms a compartment that is soft like a gel. This soft component can be altered, removed or regen-erated by adding small molecules, allowing the hybrid polymer to have different features. \"These new unprecedented materials could be used as therapeutic agents to deliver drugs to cells over long periods of time or to affect cell behavior,\" he says. Stupp's group has also used super resolu- tion microscopy to illustrate that nanofibers are capable of rearranging their structures dynamically and can adapt to the receptor patterns on cells. This work was recently published in Nature Communications. \"This particular finding implies that highly bioactive nanoscale filaments will be possible in the future to address the most difficult regenerative targets,\" Stupp says. In future work, Stupp's group plans to develop new materials capable of display- ing signals that can be turned on and off by adding certain molecules to cell cultures. \"This means that stem cells could be ma- nipulated with one signal to promote their proliferation, and then that signal could be turned off when the cells are ready to differentiate and a new signal could be introduced for differentiation,\" Stupp says. He also plans to collaborate with Northwestern newcomer John Rogers, PhD, a materials scientist who arrived from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign last September. A pioneer in the field of bio-integrated electronic devices, Rogers will lead the new Center for Bio-Integrated Electronics within the Simpson Querrey Institute for BioNanotechnology. Stupp's lab, with a focus on self-as- sembled structures, complements Rogers' research on electronic materials that inte- grate with the surfaces of the body. \"We sensed an area of opportunity for collaboration,\" Rogers says. \"With our vision to bring our two areas of expertise together, we realized we could do even more significant things in medicine.\" CROSS-DISCIPLINARY TEAM SCIENCE The ability to fine-tune the nanofibers to any target has allowed Stupp to establish collaborations across the medical school, in-cluding with John Kessler, MD, Ken and Ruth Davee Professor of Stem Cell Biology, to regenerate the nervous system in the spi-nal cord, and with Susan Quaggin, MD, chief of Nephrology, and Guillermo Oliver, PhD, Thomas D. Spies Professor of Lymphatic Metabolism, to target vascular regeneration. \"One of the projects is the great possibility of using supramolecular materials to target plaque in arteries to reverse plaque forma- tion,\" Stupp says. He's collaborating with Shad Thaxton, '04 '07 PhD, associate professor of Urology, and Melina Kibbe, MD, '03 GME, adjunct professor of Surgery, on that work. In work published in Nature Materials, his lab showed how the length of nanofibers is critical to the survival and proliferation of mammalian cells. \"The group demonstrated that cells could actually distinguish between differ-ent lengths of nanofibers even though the nanofibers were identical in their other properties,\" Stupp says. Furthermore, in a paper published in Science, Stupp's lab developed a new type Wellington Hsu, MDErin Hsu, PhD A paste made of collagen and nanofibers can enhance the growth factors in bone to promote spine fusion. 14 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE MAGAZINEThe medical school's 2016 achievements A YEAR OFIMPACT \"It's clear the Feinberg community has much to be proud of when we reflect on all we accomplished in 2016,\" says Eric G. Neilson, MD, vice president for medical affairs and Lewis Landsberg Dean. \"From our students to our faculty, our scientists to our staff, we all exemplified our school's mission: to impact the practice of medicine through discovery and education.\" Check out some of the highlights from an outstanding year. WINTER 2016-17 15FEATURE: A YEAR OF IMPACT MEDICAL STUDENTS SET BAR FOR EXCELLENCE In May, Feinberg's Class of 2016 \u2014 the first to complete the medical school's revised curriculum \u2014 graduated with distinction. In August, an exceptional Class of 2020 arrived on campus. Selected from a pool of 7,608 applicants, the 163 students represent many backgrounds: Collectively, they had 77 different undergraduate majors, speak 29 languages and come from 32 states and 6 foreign countries. STUDENT WELLNESS INITIATIVE THRIVES Recognizing that wellness and self care are essential to aca- demic success and a rewarding career, Feinberg continued to support the well-being of its students by providing resources ranging from yoga in the library to mental health services. In December, medical students took this idea to heart by taking a break from the stresses of school for the 38th annual perfor- mance of In Vivo, Feinberg's sketch comedy and variety show. \"One of the things I love about Feinberg is that it fosters an environment where a group like In Vivo exists,\" said first-year medical student Max Kelsten. SECOND-YEAR MEDICAL STUDENTS SHOWCASE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH PROJECTS In December, medical students presented research projects on top- ics spanning from neurogenesis and cancer to big data and global health. Part of the curriculum's Area of Scholarly Concentration, the four-year longitudinal research project gives students a chance to perform a hypothesis-driven investigation under the tutelage of a faculty mentor. \"Doing research is invaluable in medical school. Everything in medicine is based on science and really the best way to understand how to read a paper and in- terpret findings is by doing it,\" said second-year medical student Alison Szabo.FIRST-YEAR MEDICAL STUDENTS SAVE A LIFE During a break between classes at Lake Shore Park, five first-year medical stu- dents saved a man's life \u2014 and performed CPR for the first time. \"There was a split second of fear, because we're first-year medical students, and we'd only practiced on mannequins, but we realized if we didn't do anything then he would die,\" said Jessica Quaggin-Smith. The group attributed their actions in the park to a basic life support course they took during the first week of medical school at North- western Simulation. FEINBERG OFFERS NEW DEGREE PROGRAMS In 2016, Northwestern University estab- lished a master of science in reproductive science and medicine. The 18-month, full-time degree program provides train- ing in reproductive science focusing on mammalian reproductive biology and medicine with an emphasis on applica- tions to human health. Northwestern also officially launched a PhD program in health care quality and patient safety \u2014 the first of its kind in the country \u2014 and graduated its first student in the fall (read more about it on pg 5). PROGRAMING HIGHLIGHTS FEIN-BERG'S COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY In November, former U.S. Surgeon General Antonia Novello, MD, the first Hispanic and the first woman appointed to the position, visited Feinberg to discuss health dispari- ties in the United States. \"We have to be a ACADEMIC NEWSIn 2016, 62 percent of Feinberg's graduating class matched into top 25 programs for residency. 1 16 MAGAZINE.NM.ORG2 RESEARCH BREAKTHROUGHSHuman heart cells (red) treated with the chemotherapy drug doxorubi- cin are stained for a marker of DNA damage (green).voice for the underserved,\" she told students. Throughout the year, the Feinberg community came together for additional diversity-fo- cused events, including a presentation on the public health aspects of the pipeline construction protests in Standing Rock, North Dakota. HIV IS STILL GROWING, EVEN WHEN UNDETECTABLE IN THE BLOOD A study published in Nature challenged previous beliefs about dormant HIV by finding that HIV is still replicating in lym- phoid tissue, even when it is undetectable in the blood of patients on antiretroviral drugs. The findings provide a critical new perspective on how HIV persists in the body despite potent antiretroviral therapy. \"We now have a path to a cure,\" said corre- sponding author Steven Wolinsky, MD, '82 GME. \"The challenge is to deliver drugs at clinically effective concentrations to where the virus continues to replicate within the patient.\" NANOSCIENTISTS DEVELOP THE 'ULTIMATE DISCOVERY TOOL' A Northwestern research team developed a tool to rapidly test millions and perhaps billions of different nanoparticles at a time to zero in on the best particle for a specific application, from pharmaceuticals to electronic devices. \"As scientists, we've only just begun to investigate what mate- rials can be made on the nanoscale,\" said Chad Mirkin, PhD, professor of Medicine in the Division of Hematology/Oncology and founding director of Northwestern's Inter- national Institute for Nanotechnology, who led the study, which was published in Science.TRAILBLAZING CANCER DISCOVERIES Important findings at Northwestern in the field of cancer spanned basic science, translational and clinical research published in 2016. A study in Nature Communications showed how a signaling pathway and genetic material work together to regulate two subtypes of brain tumors called glioblastomas. Another study, published in Nature Medicine, demonstrated that reprogrammed stem cells can be used to identify patients with cancer who are likely to experience a danger- ous side effect of a common chemotherapy drug. And the results of a phase III clinical trial published in Lancet Oncology suggested that a combination of the drugs palbociclib and fulvestrant provides an effective and well-tolerated therapy for patients with recurrent metastatic breast cancer who are resistant to endocrine therapy. NEW TARGETS TO TREAT DEPRESSION REVEALED Two studies published in Molecular Psychiatry demonstrated how new pathways in the brain can be manipulated to alleviate depres- sion. The first showed that decreasing a set of proteins called HCN channels reduced depression-like behavior in mice. The second study indicated that blocking a pathway in the hippocampus in - volving a protein called BMP also has an antidepressant effect. Both findings could inform fresh therapies for millions of patients who do not respond to existing treatments for depression. NEW DIABETES SCREENING RECOMMENDATION MISSES MORE THAN HALF OF HIGH-RISK PATIENTS The latest government guidelines doctors follow to determine if patients should be screened for diabetes missed 55 percent of high-risk individuals with prediabetes or diabetes, according to a Northwestern Medicine study published in PLOS Medicine. The widely accepted 2015 screening guidelines from the United States Preventive Service Task Force recommend patients be screened for diabetes if they are between 40 and 70 years old and are WINTER 2016-17 173FEATURE: A YEAR OF IMPACT overweight or obese. But the study found many patients outside those age and weight ranges develop diabetes, especially racial and ethnic minorities. NEW DRUGS CLEAR CHRONIC SKIN DISEASES IN CLINICAL TRIALS About 80 percent of patients with moder- ate to severe psoriasis saw their disease completely or almost completely cleared with a new drug called ixekizumab, ac- cording to three large, long-term clinical trials led by Kenneth Gordon, MD, professor of Dermatology. Likewise, nearly 40 per-cent of patients with atopic dermatitis saw improvement with dupilumab in two clinical trials led by Jonathan Silverberg, MD, PhD, MPH, assistant professor of Dermatology. The results of these studies were compiled in papers published in the New England Journal of Medicine. THIRD GENE SHOWN TO CAUSE PARKINSON'S DISEASE Northwestern Medicine scientists discov-ered a new cause of Parkinson's disease \u2014 mutations in a gene called TMEM230. This appears to be only the third gene definitively linked to confirmed cases of the disease. In a study published in Nature Genetics, the scientists provided evidence of the mutations in patients with Parkin-son's disease from both North America and Asia. They also demonstrated that the gene is responsible for producing a protein involved in packaging the neu-rotransmitter dopamine in neurons. Loss of dopamine-producing neurons is a defining characteristic of Parkinson's disease. MEDICAL SCHOOL RISES IN RANKINGS Feinberg rose two spots to rank 17th among the best research- oriented medical schools in the country, according to the latest U.S. News & World Report rankings. This is the ninth year in a row Feinberg has placed as a top 20 research-oriented medical school. This year's ranking represents an all-time high. NORTHWESTERN HOSPITALS AMONG THE BEST IN LATEST U.S. NEWS RANKINGS Four Northwestern Medicine hospitals were recognized by U.S. News & World Report in its 2016-17 ranking of America's Best Hospitals, with Northwestern Memorial Hospital ranked 8th in the nation. The Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago was again recognized as the national leader in physical medicine and reha- bilitation, topping the U.S. News list for the 26th consecutive year, while Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago was ranked the 6th best children's hospital in the country. NIH FUNDING RANKINGS INCREASE The medical school ranked 18th among U.S. medical schools in total National Institutes of Health funding, an increase over previ- ous years, according to an analysis from the Blue Ridge Institute The Parkinson's disease gene TMEM230 encodes a protein that extends across the membrane of synaptic vesicles (arrows).RANKINGS AND HONORS 18 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE MAGAZINE4with career planning and collaborate with education leadership to implement effective wellness program.

In addition, Robert Bran- nigan, '92 MD, '93 '94 '98 GME, professor of Urology, was appointed assistant director of Student Affairs. He will address the unique issues medical students face, help LEADERSHIP APPOINTMENTSfor Medical Research. Nine departments at Feinberg ranked among the top ten in their specialty and six more ranked among the top 20. In addition, Northwestern University ranked 10th among world- wide institutions with the most highly cited researchers, according to analysis by Thomson Reuters. Ronald Ackermann, MD, have an extraordinary window of op- portunity to conduct innovative research on the most important health concerns and needs of LGBT populations, to train scientists and clinicians in the best practices to meet those needs and to profoundly lower barriers to healthcare and eliminate inequities in health outcomes,\" said director Brian Mustanski, PhD. NEMMERS PRIZE IN MEDICAL SCIENCE ANNOUNCED Huda Zoghbi, MD, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investiga- tor and professor at Baylor College of Medicine known for her groundbreaking research on Rett syndrome and other neurological disorders, was the inaugural recipient of the Mechthild Esser Nemmers Prize in Medical Science at Northwestern University. The prize is awarded to a physician-scientist whose body of research exhibits outstanding achievement in their discipline as demonstrated by works of lasting significance. Zoghbi delivered her keynote lecture at Northwestern in September. DATA SCIENCE TRANSFORMING BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH AT FEINBERG New data science initiatives propelled Feinberg to the future of medicine, enabling important discoveries in rare and common diseases that are beginning to translate into new treatments and individualized patient care at an accelerated pace. To support the burgeon- ing data science field, Feinberg is recruiting faculty, creating a major new center, training grad- uate students and connecting scientists to each other's data. NORTHWESTERN TO PARTICIPATE IN WHITE HOUSE-LED PRECISION MEDICINE STUDY Northwestern University was awarded more than $50 million for a five-year precision medicine grant as part of a landmark lon- gitudinal research effort that aims to engage 1 million or more U.S. participants to improve disease prevention and treatment measures based on individual differences in lifestyle, environ-ment and genetics. \"The big excitement here is the opportunity to improve the way we predict, prevent and eventually treat disease,\" said Philip Greenland, MD, the Harry W. Dingman Professor of Cardi- ology and a principal investigator of the new award. \"Just the scope of it \u2014 1 million people \u2014 is beyond anything that anybody in the U.S. has ever done. This could be a game changer.\" WOMEN'S HEALTH RESEARCH INSTITUTE CELEBRATES NEW POLICIES ON GENDER IN RESEARCH In January, the National Institutes of Health and Food and Drug Administration made effective a policy to include women in basic science and clinical research studies. \"We wanted to make this point \u2014 that women's health is not just about pregnancy and having a child,\" said Teresa Woodruff, PhD, director of the Women's Health Research Institute. \"In the WHRI, we've embraced this broad perspective of assuring women that when we say women's health we mean all of women's health.\" The new policy in- structs scientists to account for the possible role of sex as a biological variable in animal and clinical studies and to factor sex into research designs, analyses and reporting. NEW NORTHWESTERN INSTITUTE COMMITS TO IMPROVING LGBT HEALTH Northwestern University has launched the Institute for Sexual and Gender Minority Health and Wellbeing, the first research institute in the United States established university-wide that is focused exclusively NOTABLE ANNOUNCEMENTS 20 MAGAZINE.NM.ORGWRITTEN BY: Anna WilliamsWith evidence-based smartphone apps, mental healthcare is always within reach Close to seven percent of Americans suffer from major depression, and 18 percent have an anxiety disorder. Many more experience subclinical symptoms of depression and anxiety throughout their lives. Despite this considerable healthcare burden, mental health issues remain largely undertreated. At Northwestern Medicine's Center for Behavioral Intervention Technologies (CBITs), investigators are striving to close this treat-ment gap by harnessing technology already in our pockets. The center, established at Feinberg in 2011 with a National Institutes MENT AL HEAL THCARE ON HAND 12 Number of apps in the IntelliCare suite 30K+ Number of downloads since launch WINTER 2016-17 21Eventually, IntelliCare will incorporate analytics that can make personalized rec- ommendations for which app might be most appropriate for a user in the moment \u2014 \"a Netflix for mental health apps,\" Mohr explains. ADDING A HUMAN TOUCH While the sense of novelty that comes with receiving new recommendations is intended to keep users engaged, the team at CBITs also perceived that it might not be enough. \"We can't expect that a piece of technology alone is going to solve our behavioral health problems. As someone once told me, we've had scales for 100 years and people are still overweight,\" Mohr says. \"There needs to be some human engagement.\" To test this enhancement, the team conducted a trial, recently published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research, that paired IntelliCare with a dedicated coaching program. Trained coaches helped par-ticipants identify their goals over an initial phone call, and provided ongoing support via text message to check in, encourage use of the mobile tools and answer questions. Coaches also had access to a dashboard pro-viding data on which IntelliCare apps their clients were using and when. Kathryn Noth Tomasino, PhD, a clinical psychologist at CBITs, helped develop this aspect of the IntelliCare intervention. \"We think coaching is a critical part of the expe-rience,\" Tomasino says. \"We're not trying to replace what people already do in therapy. Rather, we're helping people build those skills into the context of their everyday lives, so they can practice them regularly and in the moment.\" The results of the trial were encourag- ing. Study participants improved to a degree similar to that expected from psychotherapy of Health (NIH) grant, is dedicated to developing web and mobile technologies that help people make positive behavior changes for their health. David Mohr, PhD, director of CBITs and a professor of Preventive Medicine in the Division of Behavioral Medicine, is leading one of the center's key efforts: bring-ing mental health treatment straight to people's smartphones. \"Most people aren't treated for depression \u2014 the average time from first onset of the disorder to first treatment is eight years,\" Mohr says. \"The hope is that by using technologies, we can find ways to deliver treatments that are both cost-effective and easily accessible.\" With more than 70 percent of Ameri- cans now carrying a smartphone, the device is a promising tool in the push to increase access to care. But there are challenges: While clinical trials have suggested that web and mobile technology can help people manage mental health issues in principle, it has often failed in practice. Many of the apps currently available are poorly designed \u2014 cumbersome to use or dense with didactic material \u2014 and thus quickly abandoned by users. \"Generally people download a health app, they use it for a few days or a week, and then they get tired of it,\" says Mohr, also a professor of Medical Social Sciences and of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. \"But that doesn't work for behavior change, which requires consistent effort over many weeks and months.\" So in the spring of 2015, CBITs released a mental health program designed with en-gagement in mind: IntelliCare, a hub of 12 interactive smartphone apps that combat depression and anxiety with evidence-based strategies. The design better mirrors the way people use smartphones in their everyday lives. \"We realized that people tend to engage with most apps for a few seconds to get just one thing done,\" Mohr says, like finding a destination on Google Maps or ordering dinner on GrubHub. Incorporating all of the strategies shown to effectively treat depression into one app would likely over-whelm and turn off users. With that in mind, the team at CBITs de- cided to develop a suite of apps, with each individual app focusing on a single strategy that requires just a few minutes of time. One day users might find comfort in \"Daily Feats,\" a checklist that recognizes positive daily accomplishments. The next day, they might benefit from \"Thought Challenger,\" which borrows a strategy from cognitive behavioral therapy to help users identify a biased negative thought pattern and develop a more balanced perspective. FEATURE: MENTAL HEALTHCARE ON HAND \"WE'RE NOT TRYING TO REPLACE WHAT PEOPLE ALREADY DO IN THERAPY . RATHER, WE'RE HELPING PEOPLE BUILD THOSE SKILLS INTO THE CONTEXT OF THEIR EVERYDA Y LIVES. \" Kathryn Noth Tomasino, PhD 22 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE MAGAZINE\"Right now when somebody is de- pressed \u2014 when they're having a mental health problem that saps their motivation and leaves them feeling hopeless \u2014 the care system requires that they have the energy and impetus to go seek help,\" Mohr says. \"Ultimately, it'd be great if we could detect depression reliably enough that we could monitor people at risk and send some indication to providers who could then reach out.\" Down the line, sensors might even be able to address mental health problems automatically. \"If we can detect behaviors related to depression, it allows us to then develop applications that become respon-sive \u2014 like a therapist in your pocket,\" Mohr explains. \"It could say, 'It's a sunny Saturday afternoon, and you've been sitting at home alone all day. Why don't you go for a walk?'\" CBITs is also producing interventions as varied as MedLink, a tech-based approach to improving medication adherence, to a smart-phone mental health program designed for homeless youth, led by Stephen Schueller, PhD, assistant professor of Preventive Medi-cine in the Division of Behavioral Medicine. Tomasino recently conducted a controlled trial that found a web-based program for adults 65 and older \u2014 a high-risk group that's often isolated \u2014 reduced depression over eight weeks. \"Technology can be very valuable in our public health efforts to reduce de-pression,\" Tomasino says. \"It can fit into the fabric of people's lives in a way that therapy aims to, but doesn't really have the reach to do so effectively. Our hope is that now, when someone is having that sudden overwhelming feeling of sadness or not feeling motivated, they have a tool that's right at hand.\" or antidepressants, Mohr says. The data also showed that participants stayed engaged: Use of IntelliCare apps remained strong and consistent for eight weeks \u2014 relatively rare for an app intervention. The team is now conducting a controlled trial to confirm the results of this initial study and to investigate the impact of dif-ferent levels of coaching. Meanwhile, the IntelliCare suite, which is publicly available on Google Play, has been downloaded more than 30,000 times since its launch. While CBITs doesn't collect data on the general population, they sus-pect the apps are reaching both people who use IntelliCare with therapy or medication, as well as those who simply don't have ac-cess to traditional mental healthcare. THE FUTURE OF MOBILE MENTAL HEALTH IntelliCare is just one tool on CBITs' growing roster of innovations. The center has col-laborated on more than 60 projects and 35 NIH grants at Northwestern and beyond. One major focus is investigating the value of smartphone sensors in predicting depression. For example, Purple Robot, a sen-sor app developed at CBITs, can collect GPS data on how much time someone spends at home and the variability of places they visit, factors correlated with depression.

But it was the skill and compas-sion her mentors showed when talking with families in the midst of very challeng-ing and often tragic circumstances that inspired Michelson most. \"I was impressed by the impact physi- cians can have as they guide families through their worst tragedy or an incredibly uplifting outcome,\" she says. This interest in helping families through difficult circumstances led Michelson to study how physicians talk with families of critically ill children about end-of-life care during her fellowship at Children's Memo-rial Hospital, now the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, from 2001 to 2004. Today an attending physician at the same hospital, and an associate professor of Pediatrics in the Division of Critical Care at Feinberg, Michelson continues that line of research with support from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute and American Cancer Society.Michelson explains that there are many bioethical questions that arise at the bedside for physicians, parents and patients. For example, how far should cli-nicians go with technology, now capable of taking over many bodily functions, to keep a patient alive when survival is unlikely? And how much of a say should parents, patients and physicians have in the decisions made along the way? As director of Northwestern's new Center for Bioethics and Medical Humanities, Michelson hopes to bring together clinicians, residents, fellows and the community to tackle these and other ethical challenges in medicine. Her appointment has generated a lot of excitement, says Z. Leah Harris, MD, head of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine at Feinberg and Lurie Children's. \"There is a need to have a Center for Bioethics and Medical Humanities leader who is a triple threat \u2014 ethicist, clinician and investigator,\" Harris says. BUILDING COMMUNITY The new center will build on the work of Northwestern's former Medical Humanities and Bioethics program, which played an important role in the education of medical students at Feinberg for more than 25 years. Notably, Michelson wants to expand the center's reach beyond medical stu-dents to include residents and fellows. Already, Angira Patel, MD, MPH, '10, '11 GME, assistant professor of Pediat-rics and Medical Education, has begun developing the center's ethics certifica-tion program for residents and fellows. \"There has been greater recogni- tion of the role ethics can play in the clinical arena,\" explains Joel Frader, MD, head of the Division of Palliative Care at WINTER 2016-17 25Lurie Children's and a mentor of Michelson's. \"There is wider understanding that this needs to be a greater part of clinical educa-tion and training.\" The center will also be a resource for scientists at Northwestern. For instance, Michelson is working with Northwestern's Tamara Isakova, MD, MMSc, director of the Center for Translational Metabolism and Health, on a grant application to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for a project that would provide resources to safely and ethically translate discoveries to patients with kidney disease. Michel-son says discussing ethical implications helps investigators refine their research questions and address potential ethical concerns related to the conduct of their work as well as the innovations that result from their findings. \"There's a lot of interplay between research and ethics that I'm hoping to sup-port,\" she says. To broaden the center's reach, Michelson would like to regularly connect the clinical bioethics teams at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, the Rehabilitation Institute of Chi-cago and Lurie Children's Hospital to share experiences and support one another. Bringing ethics into day-to-day prac- tice at the hospitals is essential, Harris says. She says clinicians increasingly must grapple with ethics in their clinical decision-making as medicine advances. \"Sometimes it is no longer a question of can we intervene, but should we,\" Harris says. \"The new imperative will be for clini-cians not only to be clinically excellent, but also ethical and humane.\" The public also has a stake in the bioethical questions facing clinicians and investigators, Michelson notes. \"I'm hoping the center will extend beyond Northwestern and engage the community in these conversations and decisions about how we deliver and advance healthcare,\" Michelson says. \"These affect everyone.\" A TENACIOUS LEADER Carrying out this ambitious agenda will require securing sufficient resources for bioethical research and programs across departments that may be siloed, says Frader. But Michelson's research back-ground and tenacity will be assets as she faces these challenges. During his 15-year collaboration with Michelson, which began during her fellow-ship, Frader has seen her repeatedly win over skeptics with her hard work. For ex-ample, she won a very coveted early career development grant from the NIH, beating out many applicants with more traditional biomedical research backgrounds. Michel-son has embraced qualitative research, a departure from the more quantitative epidemiological research she learned while earning her masters in public health at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill in 1996 and her medical degree at Duke University in 1997.FEATURE: BRINGING ETHICS TO THE BENCH AND BEDSIDE When Michelson began her research, hospitals and clinicians weren't focused on patient-centered outcomes like they are today, explains Harris. Michelson really had to chart her own course guided by her values and commitment to understanding families and patients. \"She'll be able to bring that same moral courage and fortitude to teaching a whole community how to apply ethics to what we do day in and day out,\" Harris says. Her skill bringing together clinical staff during end-of-life care discussions will also be an asset in her new role. \"She is the consummate listener,\" Harris says. \"She recognizes we are not all going to agree. She makes people feel comfort-able disagreeing and voicing opinions.\" Frader agreed that Michelson's skill as a communicator and problem-solver will be critical. \"Kelly is persistent and creative, and she wants to be able to bring the voices of patients and families to the table when making choices about the care of sick children,\" Frader says. \"I think she can bring that sense of how to invite and include many different people and solve problems collaboratively to the center.\"\"The new imperative will be for clinicians not only to be clinically excellent, but also ethical and humane.\" 26 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE MAGAZINEWRITTEN BY: Andrea Arntsen-HarrisNorthwestern's Lois Insolia ALS Clinic is a model for multidisciplinary care Celebrating 30 Years of ALS CareWhen it opened in July 1986, the Lois Inso- lia ALS Clinic at Northwestern Medicine was one of the first multidisciplinary ALS clinics in the country \u2014 the very first in the Chicago area \u2014 dedicated to the total care and sup-port of people with ALS, their families and their caregivers. Scott Heller, MD, '84 GME, was recruited to serve as the first director of the Lois Insolia ALS Clinic. At that time, it was a three-person operation \u2014 one clinician, one nurse coordinator and one clinician-scientist. Photos courtesy of the Les Turner ALS Foundation WINTER 2016-17 27FEATURE: CELEBRATING 30 YEARS OF ALS CARE \"In 1986, it was a novel idea to create a multidisciplinary clinic like this,\" says Heller, currently a neurologist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and a clinical associate professor of Neurology at Feinberg. \"Now, what was once novel has become the standard, state-of-the-art way to provide this type of care. We set the para-digm nationally and internationally.\" The clinic, now directed by Robert Sufit, MD, has grown im- mensely in its three decades. During a visit, patients meet with members of a large, experienced multidisciplinary team that includes five neurologists, two pulmonologists and experts that provide genetic counseling, occupational therapy, speech therapy, respiratory therapy, dietetic counseling and coordinate clinical trials. Clinic physicians and staff take the time to carefully explain the disease and current research to patients and their families. The team also works with patients and families to address symptoms such as difficulty with speech and swallowing, weight loss, prob-lems with sleeping, breathing and excess salivation, and difficulties with activities of daily life, mobility or pain. UNITING ALS RESEARCH, CLINICAL CARE AND EDUCATION In 2014, the Lois Insolia ALS Clinic be- came part of the newly formed Les Turner ALS Research and Patient Center at Northwestern Medicine. The center, created through a $10 mil-lion commitment from the Les Turner ALS Foundation, unites ALS research, clinical and education activities under one umbrella. This model supports collaboration between the clinic and scientists at Northwestern, including those working in Feinberg's three ALS labs. All of these efforts are within the Institute for Translational Neuroscience at Northwestern Medicine. Another unique aspect of the clinic is its relationship with the Les Turner ALS Foundation, which offers a continuum of care to ALS patients and their families. Clinicians and members of the founda-tion's Home and Community Team, a group of experienced registered Matt Toole, a patient diagnosed with ALS in 2013, is interviewed with his family at the 2016 ALS Walk for Life. The event supported patient service programs through the Les Turner ALS Research and Patient Center at Northwestern Medicine. 28 MAGAZINE.NM.ORGnurses and social workers, work together to ensure that patient needs are met from both a clinical and home support perspective. \"Going forward, we seek to continue maximizing our efforts in research, clinical trials and patient care, and services through the Les Turner ALS Research and Patient Center at Northwestern Medicine,\" says Heller, who is a longtime Les Turner ALS Founda-tion board member, vice president of medical services and chair of its patient services committee. \"The wide reach of our programs and the continued impact on our patients, their families and the entire ALS community are most important.\" Elmhurst resident Matt Toole was diagnosed with ALS in 2013, and today receives care from the team at the Lois Insolia ALS Clinic. \"The staff at the clinic is compassionate, professional and invaluable to us as we travel this unpredictable journey of living with ALS,\" he says. \"The team approach at the multidisciplinary clinic enables us to meet with dedicated specialists to support our healthcare needs in a comprehensive and efficient way.\"\"The staff at the clinic is compassionate, professional and invaluable to us as we travel this unpredictable journey of living with ALS .\" Matt Toole, patient at the Lois Insolia ALS ClinicMatt's wife, Karen, adds, \"The communi- cation between the team at the clinic and our home and community services team from the Les Turner ALS Foundation has been instrumental in getting things done. This seamless, transparent communica-tion team has given us the peace of mind to know that no matter what is going on everybody is on the same page and up to speed on the situation.\" NORTHWESTERN PARTNERS: THE LES TURNER ALS FOUNDATION AND THE INSOLIA FAMILY Shortly after losing his wife, Lois, to ALS, James Insolia and his family attended a Les Turner ALS Foundation support group. Insolia was moved with a deep sense of empathy for other families living with ALS. As a result, he partnered with the Les Turner ALS Foundation in 1986 to establish the Lois Insolia ALS Clinic. Since Insolia's passing, his son Greg and his sister Gia have continued his tradition of support through the James V. Insolia Fam-ily Foundation. Additionally, Greg and his wife, Rosemary, have been longtime active supporters of the Les Turner ALS Foundation. Since 1986, the Insolia family has contributed more than $1.25 million to continue the legacy of Lois and to provide the highest level of care for people with ALS. \"My father felt strongly that a multidisciplinary patient clinic for those living with ALS was critical in the Chicagoland area,\" says Greg Insolia. \"It is an honor to have helped establish and provide that resource for over 30 years through the Les Turner ALS Founda-tion while carrying on the memory of my mother. Our family looks forward to continuing this partnership for years to come.\" \"After 30 milestone years, we are humbled and honored that the Lois Insolia ALS Clinic not only provides the pinnacle of care to those with ALS, but remains the only fully multidisciplinary ALS clinic in the Chicagoland area,\" says Andrea Pauls Backman, executive director of the Les Turner ALS Foundation.

Javier Guevara Jr., '12 MD, on the other hand, practices family medicine at a busy community health center in Chicago's Logan Square neighborhood, providing care to the area's underserved, often Spanish-speaking, population. Despite the contrast in their specialties, clinical environments and even their generations, Bonucci and Guevara found plenty of common ground when they teamed up to host an Alumni Physicians of Feinberg gathering, organized by the medical student societies. The program, now in its third year, brings in Feinberg alumni from a range of backgrounds and concentrations to discuss their careers, share personal stories and answer questions from cur-rent medical students. The informal dinners provide attendees with real-world perspective on life in various specialties and give students an intimate look at the diverse career paths open to them after graduation. Bonucci and Guevara fielded questions from 15 students, cover- ing topics ranging from finding ways to carve out time for research to working at a healthcare organization with shared values. Guevara said his specialty inherently lends itself to forging relationships. \"I'm caring for entire families \u2014 the true definition of family medicine \u2014 and I love that,\" he said. \"I'm from Mexico, and to be able to speak the language of the patients in my community and connect with people on that level is really important to me. I feel so rewarded, and there's not one day that's boring.\" Both physicians devoted a significant portion of the event to stressing the importance of work-life balance alongside active clinical schedules. \"You are going to have lots of demands, lots of opportunities to use your knowledge and training. So you do need to decide what's important to you and draw some boundaries,\" Bonucci said. \"We as physicians have great opportunities to be lifetime learners. But we have to make sure that as we grow professionally, we also have those other parts of our lives, like family and hobbies, that keep us balanced.\" Second-year medical student Emily Li said she found such advice invaluable. \"It's really helpful to hear about the world outside of academic medicine,\" she said. \"To have the physicians discuss their lifestyles \u2014 that isn't something we often talk about in school.\"Sean Posada, another second-year med- ical student agreed. \"For a lot of students, this is really critical information as we plan our futures, clerkships and look forward to applying for residency,\" he said.

WINTER 2016-17 37WARD ROUNDS\u00ae PROFILE Break Barriers in Vascular SurgeryMelina Kibbe, MD, '03 GME, is no stranger to breaking glass ceilings. As a leader and a surgeon-scientist, she continues to prove that gender barriers are no match for her tenacity and passion. Written By Amber Bemis 38 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE MAGAZINEAfter a nearly 13-year career at Northwest- ern, that passion and tenacity led her to the University of North Carolina School of Medicine (UNC) and Health Care System for a new role as the Zack D. Owens Distinguished professor and chair of the Department of Surgery. Kibbe is one of only sixteen women in the nation to hold that position. \"My life changed overnight when I as- sumed the role of chair of surgery. I went from being a practicing vascular surgeon, running my funded research lab and helping to promote research in my department, to running an entire department of surgery,\" Kibbe says. In her new position, Kibbe is leading a department of surgery that includes 9 divisions with 282 members, including 69 faculty members, 42 advanced practice providers, 83 residents and fellows, and 88 staff. Her focus for the department is supporting the school's three missions: providing high quality clinical care, educat-ing the next generation of surgeons and surgeon-scientists, and being at the fore-front of innovation and discovery research for surgical disease. Until she accepted the position at UNC, Kibbe had spent her entire faculty career at Northwestern. After completing a one-year fellowship in the Department of Surgery in 2003, she decided to stay on as a faculty member specifically so she could be men-tored by Bill Pearce, MD, '82 GME, the Violet R. and Charles A. Baldwin Professor of Vascular Surgery. Kibbe went on to hold numerous positions in the department, as well as several appointments at Northwest-ern Memorial Hospital, the Jesse Brown VA Medical Center and Northwestern Univer-sity. She remains an adjunct professor in the Department of Surgery at Northwestern. \"It was incredibly hard to leave a place that I really do love, especially with the great leadership team at Northwestern, my colleagues and my mentors,\" Kibbe says. \"At Northwestern, I was helping fellow scien-tists at the department level and forming collaborations across the university, and I knew this was something I wanted to do more of. It gives me tremendous at Northwestern. One of those is remain-ing in contact with every single one of the trainees who worked in her lab, from un-dergraduate students to medical students, PhDs to postdocs. Her advice to young scientists inter- ested in pursuing medicine or research as a career: \"Follow your passion. If you are passionate about what you are working on, then you are going to have tremendous career satisfaction, and when that happens you do amazing things.\" In the lab, Kibbe's research focuses on developing novel therapies for patients with vascular disease while simultane-ously studying the mechanism of how these therapies impact the vascular wall. She is currently the principal investiga-tor on three National Institutes of Health (NIH) R01 awards, a VA Merit award and a Department of Defense award. She continues to serve as a consultant on several NIH awards with Northwestern faculty, including Mary McDermott, MD, to evaluate novel therapies for patients with peripheral arterial disease. Together with Teresa Woodruff, PhD, Kibbe is also a nationally recognized advocate for sex inclusion in biomedical research. In 2016, their efforts led to new policies to include women in basic science and clinical re-search studies from the NIH and Food and Drug Administration. Kibbe's bibliography includes more than 230 peer-reviewed manuscripts, review articles and book chapters. She has received numerous awards, including, in 2010, the Presidential Early Career Award for Scien-tists and Engineers, the highest honor given by the U.S. government to outstanding scientists in the early stages of their inde-pendent research careers. Most recently, she was elected into the National Academy of Medicine. \"I am so proud of the research we are conducting, and I am very proud of the trainees who have come through the lab and are now in their own faculty positions,\" Kibbe says. \"Every single one of my trainees has gone on to an academic setting, which makes me extremely proud.\" satisfaction to help others figure out how to pursue their ideas and see them come to fruition.\" Kibbe attributes much of her success to her dedicated mentors. \"I have been blessed throughout my career with men-tors who have been heavily invested in my own career development and success. They have really shaped how I mentor oth-ers,\" Kibbe says. \"My time at Northwestern prepared me incredibly well for my next leadership challenge.\" Kibbe has mentored more than 89 medi- cal students, PhD students and residents, and has received 18 teaching awards, including the Gender Equity Award from the American Medical Women's Association student chap-ter at Northwestern and the George H. Joost Outstanding Teaching Award.

The blood colored red is full of oxygen, flowing out to the rest of the body, while the blood colored blue is returning to be re-oxygenated by the lungs. With this tech-nique, scientists can measure the speed and patterns of this flow: yellow and orange streaks move faster than dark red; pale blue moves faster than dark blue. They are ex-amined this particular heart to monitor the heart health of a patient after surgery. Kelly Jarvis, a graduate student in the lab of Michael Markl, PhD, professor of Radiology, won first place in Northwestern's Science in Society annual scientific images contest for this illustration of the heart.
