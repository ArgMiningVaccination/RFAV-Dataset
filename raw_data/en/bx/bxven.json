The writings of Hippocrates (460-370 BC) and Galen (130-200 BC) and even ancient manuscripts of the Egyptians, Hindus and Chinese reveal many principles common to chiropractic. Its place in modern health care is largely attributed to Dr. Daniel David Palmer, who founded the first chiropractic college, in Davenport, Iowa, in 1897. The tenets of chiropractic hold that a human being's nervous system is essential to health, and that interference with this system impairs normal body functions and lowers the body's resistance to disease. The study of chiropractic includes the various ways in which the nervous system can be irritated or impeded, resulting in pain or illness, as well as techniques to correct these problems. Chiropractic is also based on the premise that the body can achieve and maintain health through its own natural recuperative powers, as long as it receives the right food, water, adequate rest, exercise, clean air, adequate nutrition and has a properly functioning nervous system. The specific focus of chiropractic practice is known as the chiropractic subluxation or joint dysfunction. A subluxation is a health concern that manifests in the skeletal joints, and, through complex anatomical and physiological relationships, affects the nervous system and may lead to reduced function, disability or illness. Typically, symptoms of subluxation include one or more of the following: A doctor of chiropractic may detect subluxations through standard physical examination procedures, specific chiropractic assessments or special tests.
