We are constantly reviewing new articles and studies, and we readily use new knowledge in the clinic. While some may feel the evidence is lacking for natural therapies, this is decidedly not the case; evidence has long been mounting for the therapies we use in our clinic. Our practice is also informed by patient preference. When patients have a preference for a certain type of therapy, we work with them so that they get the greatest benefit from that treatment. We believe firmly that our patients are not biochemical equations to be solved - they are living, breathing people who need to be cared for, not fixed. We were therefore excited to learn of a recent study in the online journal PLoS One, which found that individualized homeopathic treatment was superior to fluoxetine (Prozac) in the treatment of depression and menopausal symptoms in menopausal age women. The article is [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4359147/) for your reference. Dr. Runde and Dr. Paddock are both trained extensively in homeopathy, and have used this type of treatment for conditions ranging from digestive disturbances to chronic pain. If you are looking for homeopathic treatment, you can be confident that we will offer you the best. Call today with "}
