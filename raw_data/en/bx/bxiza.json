I feel her healing and loving vibrations gently lighting the night sky and touching my heart. The Full Moon is a time to manifest. It's a time to make things happen. Here are MY personal full moon ritual ideas for healing and love, as well as a look at the full moon ritual herbs I use on a monthly basis. Full Moon Ritual Ideas Using the 4 Elements 1. The Water Element Every provoking full moon ritual idea typically involves the water element in some form. Why? Because the moon is directly related to water - it pulls on the ocean's tides AND effects our lives because we're made up of 60%+ water. Some types of full moon rituals with water include ritual baths, making moon water, and full moon baptisms. We will go into each of these in detail below. Take a Ritual Bath on the Full Moon IMO one of the best ways to get the most of the full moon's magick is to take a [ritual bath](https://otherworldlyoracle.com/ritual-baths/). It sounds super fancy but it doesn't take much. All you need is a bathtub in a quiet space, and maybe some body-friendly herbs, salts, and oils to add to the bath. Some of our favorite ritual bathing herbs include rose, chamomile, lavender, calendula, and jasmine. If you don't have these herbs just lying around, add a few drops of essential oils to the bath. Or maybe some epsom salts. At the very least, put on some relaxing, witchy music and burn a candle. Sit back and meditate. Make Moon Water [Making Full Moon water](https://otherworldlyoracle.com/moon-water/) is as easy as leaving a vessel of water out under the moonlight to soak up its rays and energy. We recommend using a glass jar or bottle with an airtight lid. Fill it nearly to the top then cap it. Set it out when the moon rises and bring it inside before the sunlight hits it. Some witches also enjoy adding herbs, crystals (non-soluble and non-toxic), etc. to their full moon water. Then use that water to cleanse your tools, altar, crystals, add it to your ritual bath, add a cup to your laundry, the choices are endless! Be careful drinking moon water, as water has the potential to collect microbes (bacteria, fungi, etc.) when left out too long. 2. The Fire Element If you're more of a fire person, that's okay too! The fire element can be harnessed with candle rituals on the Full Moon that are SUPER effective! Bonfires are also fun as part of full moon ritual. What's better than being outside, sitting by a fire, with the Full Moon's light shining down on you? Fire scrying is part of having a full moon bonfire, or petition papers thrown into the fire under the moon's gaze. 3. Full Moon Air Magick Something that's really fun and whimsical to do is to blow bubbles in the moonlight. Think I'm crazy? Give it a try. You're combining multiple elements, air and water, in this easy ritual. If you have kids that can't seem to give you any free time, get them involved. I don't know a single kid or person who doesn't enjoy blowing bubbles. Plus, allowing them to soak up the moon's rays, then reading their flight patterns is magical and relaxing. If the bubbles aren't your thing, scrying with smoke is an air element ritual OR simply go outside and let the breeze talk to you. 4. Full Moon Earth Rituals Whenever I'm in the kitchen, I feel grounded. I feel close to my ancestors. And I feel closer to the earth. If you can't get outside on the next esbat, consider making some magick in your kitchen. Brew a full moon tea, [make moon cookies](https://otherworldlyoracle.com/full-moon-food-guide/), or simply make an offering to your ancestors by way of the hearth. All full moon activities that invoke the earth element and your ancestors. If you don't want to be in the kitchen, green witches should consider growing a moon garden with flowers that bloom in the full moon. Moonflower, night blooming jasmine, evening primrose, and night phlox are just a few amazing plants to add to your moon garden. Charging Your Tools and Crystals in the Moonlight A popular ritual nowadays, and for good reason, is to charge your crystals and tools in the full moon's light. Place your crystals, stones, amulets, charm bags, and magical tools in a safe, dry place under the moonlight. Allow the moon to charge your beloved items with its loving, powerful vibrations. Then remove your items before the sun comes up. If you'd like to learn more about [charging via the moonlight click here](https://otherworldlyoracle.com/charging-crystals-moon-water/).
