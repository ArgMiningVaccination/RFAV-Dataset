REVIEW According to modern medicine, types of immunity are as follows10- Immunity Innate Immunity Acquired Immunity (Inborn Immunity) (Adaptive Immunity) Naturally Acquired Artificially Acquired Active Passive Active Passive Immunizing agents are vaccines, immunoglobulins, anti- sera. In 1789, Edward Jenner, for the first time produced vaccine for small pox therefore, he is known as founder of vaccine. Nowadays approximately 35 vaccines are available and maximum vaccines are administered under national health programmes. Now the question is why is Swarnaprashan relevant in the era of vaccines? The an- swer is disadvantages of vaccination which are as fol- lows- 1. Different vaccines for different diseases. 2. Vaccines are available only for 35 diseases and not for many diseases. 3. Fever, nausea, diarrhea, seizures and anaphylactic reactions may occur after vaccination. 4. Painful procedure 5. Preservatives which are used in vaccines are fatal for infants. 6. Various adverse effects of vaccines have been rec- orded in many countries. Our great Acharyas knew immunity as Bala, Oja and Vyadhikshamatva . Acharya Charak has mentioned that body of all persons is not capable of Vyadhikshamatva11. Acharya Chakrapani has commented on the word Vyadhikshamatva that Vyadhikshamatva opposes the strength of diseases and prevents the origin of diseases12. It is clear that immunity has been mentioned by Acharya Charak as Vyadhikshamatva . Again, Acharya Charak has explained that there are three types of Bala (immuni- ty) - 1. Sahaj (natural/congenital) 2. Kalaj (by time/season/age) 3. Yuktij (acquired) 13. This categorization of immunity is very much similar to modern categorization. Acharya Sushrut has mentioned that optimum part of all Dhatu, from rasa to Shukra is called oja and this is also known as Bala. This Bala or Vyadhikshamatva (immunity) is increased by Swarnaprashan . Swarnaparashan is administration of gold alone or along with other herbs in a leha or prash form. Acharya Kashyap has described Swarnaprashan as Leha form. Swarnaprashan is indicated in healthy children having compromised breast feeding and minor metabolic prob- lems. It is contraindicated in seriously ill patients. Alt- hough lehana is contraindicated on a daily basis but Swarnaprashan is continued for a period of one or six months to get its specific benefits in children. In a study on neonates, Madhu-Ghrit-Swarna-Vacha combination Antigens enter into the body natu- rally then body pro- duces antibodies Antibodies pass from mother to fetus via placen- ta or milk Antigens are intro- duced by vaccines then body produces antibodies Preformed anti- bodies in immune serum are intro- Swarnaprashan: An Ayurvedic Immunization 7, Issue 1, January - 2019 ( www.iamj.in ) Page 106 showed a significant effect of humoral antibody for- mation which was proved by triggering the response of immunological systems by a rise in the total protein and serum IgG level14. Swarnabhasma has a stimulatory ef- fect on macrophages which may be helpful to fight against infections15. In a study of chronic toxicity of swarnabindu prashan no cytotoxicity was observed16. According to Charak, Balyavastha comes under 16 to 30 years of age in which growth and development occurs. Actually Swarnaprashan can be done in any age group providing different benefits. As an immunomodulator it can be given in early ages because it is stage of develop- ing immune system. It can be used in immunodeficiency diseases provided that there is no serious illness associ- ated with. As an intelligence enhancer it can be given from birth to six months daily. As a fertility enhancer it can be given in adolescence because this is the stage of developing reproductive system. In Jatakarma Sansakar, Acharya Sushrut has mentioned to take Swarnabhasma along with honey and ghee as a single dose after birth. Acharya Vagbhat has indicated to take Swarnabhasma along with other herbs in Jatakarma Sanskar. Acharya Kashyap has not mentioned the specif- ic of Swarnabhasma . He has mentioned the gen- eral doses of Swarnabhasma for children. According to different Acharyas doses of Swarnabhasma are as fol- (125 mg)- SushrutaSharirstha19 DISCUSSION Swarnaprashan is the best method for immunity en- hancement which has been mentioned in Ayurvedic texts thousands years ago. Three forms of gold have been mentioned in text books for medicinal use- foil, powder and Bhasma (ash). Bhasma is said to have nanoparticles of gold having more bioavailability without any cytotox- ic effects. Therefore, Swarnabhasma is used in Swarnaprashan and as a composition of many ayurvedic drugs. It is used in the dose from 15mg to 250 mg ac- cording to various conditions. Acharya Kashyap has not mentioned any specific day or time for administration of Swarnabhasma. Acharya Kashyap has mentioned that Swarnaprashan should be prepared facing east direction. Acharya Charak has explained that Swarna should for Punsavankarma . Acharaya Sushruta Pushya Nakshatra for Rasayan karma. Nowadays, Swarnaprashan is given in Pushya Nakshatra due to the belief that this is an auspicious star to use any medicine for its nourishment effect. CONCLUSION Swarnaprashan is a very effective ancient method for immunity enhancement. Immunity power caused by Swarnaprashan provides physical, mental and intellec- tual growth and prevention of all diseases. Thus Swarnaprashan creates competent and healthy children which make a healthy society then healthy nation and a healthy world can be made ultimately. There is need of research in Swarnaprashan on modern parameters to globalize it. After an analytical research, it can be proved better than vaccination and can replace vaccination. Swarnaprashan is being propagated by many organiza- tions like Arogya Bharti in many Lucknow and Arogya Bharti , swarnaprashan created better the patients of encephalitis in Gorakhpur of Uttarpradesh, India.
