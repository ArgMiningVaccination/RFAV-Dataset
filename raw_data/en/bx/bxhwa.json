This problem is ongoing and cannot be tolerated or ignored. Because the risk of weather fluctuations exists and the possibility of a suitable environment for those viruses exists. The effect of these conditions has been evident in the foot-and-mouth disease, which has always taken place in the Egyptian environment. The various infectious diseases, which do not exist in Egypt, enter through the port of Sudan to represent a direct outlet for other African countries that do not have a border. The continued importation of camels and cattle from Sudan is considered a permanent threat. The continued vaccination of animals with Rift Valley Fever vaccine for decades is also inappropriate behavior to address this problem. As the possibility of cheating in the vaccine, especially in a country like Egypt, puts the country at risk of a pandemic through the vaccine, which has already happened before. The application of vaccine safety tests is not enough, because it does not include the experiment on the target animals so fully that we observe the pathological effect of the tested vaccine, which include strict and rigorous pathological examination. Ignoring the source of natural infection and continuing to import these animals is the real problem that must be faced. The control of disease-carrying insects must be effective and severe. Both in countries exporting disease and receiving countries. Biography: Dr. Samia Ahmed Kamal is (Associate professor) first researcher in virology department in AHRI of Egypt.
