The purpose of manipulation is to restore proper mobility to joints of the spine and extremities that have become restricted in movement. These restrictions can be caused by a single traumatic event, such as a sports injury, or through repetitive stresses, such as sitting in a position with poor posture for an extended period of time. In either case, this can cause tissue injury as the structures undergo physical and chemical changes that can cause inflammation, pain, and decreased function. Manipulation, or adjustment of the affected joint helps restore mobility, reduce pain and decrease muscle tightness. Most athletes seek regular chiropractic care to maintain their mobility and keep them at peak performance. Our general patient population also touts success with maintenance care, reporting less days of pain and mobility issues between treatments. Our patient's needs vary, and because of that, we are able to deliver a wide array of chiropractic treatments. While most of our patients enjoy hands on treatment, some prefer the adjusting instrument or table assisted manipulations for more subtle changes. Each patient's needs and wishes are important to us: we want you feel comfortable with your treatments, and confident we will exceed your expectations! At Focus On Health, we match patient needs with preference to ensure we deliver results quickly, comfortably, and efficiently. "}
