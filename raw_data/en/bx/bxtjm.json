Political events - Brexit, Trump, a snap general election, a hung parliament, confidence and supply arrangementsand the Queen's speech - have laid bare deep divisionsbetween old and young, right and left, urban and rural.These tensions have been exacerbated by terrorist incidents in London and Manchester, plus the Grenfell Tower fire, in turn politicised and rechanneled into blame and recrimination. There is no clear consensus emerging about how to resolve debates about 'austerity', security, cuts in public services, the burgeoning national and personal debt andthe mode of our exit from the European Union. Ourleaders also seem to lack the confidence and skillsnecessary to show us the way forward. Furthermore, this cultural and political deadlock has divided friends andfamilies and toxified social media. Britain is imploding. Alongside all this is a rising hostility to Christian faith and values. The British General Election may have turnedthe world of Westminster upside down, but in its aftermath evangelicalism has emerged as a key theme: the resignation of Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farronover his views on homosexuality 1and the extraordinary level of public criticism of the Democratic Unionists (DUP)for their Christian beliefs and opposition to same-sexmarriage and abortion. With this resentment toward the DUP and its partnership with the Tory government hascome a political resolve to extend the Abortion Act andsame-sex marriage to Northern Ireland. This intensifying backlash against conservative moral values on life and sexuality betrays a conviction amongst many mainstream politicians that Bible-believingChristians ought not to hold public office. With social policy following such a liberalised trajectory in the media and corridors of power, onewonders if there would any longer be a place forevangelical luminaries like William Wilberforce or theEarl of Shaftesbury in contemporary British politics. It is not all one way - the recent decision of the General Pharmaceutical Council to allow scope for freedom ofconscience in its latest guidelines (p5) was a welcomesurprise as was the Belfast Court of Appeal decision to declare Northern Ireland's restrictive abortion lawcompatible with the Human Rights Act. 2But the recent decision of the British Medical Association to back thecomplete decriminalisation of abortion (p4) and thegovernment's reflex decision to fund abortions forNorthern Irish women traveling elsewhere in the UK 3 were truly astonishing. There are serious challenges ahead. The Queen's Speech foreshadowed plans to combat 'non-violent extremism' and establish a Commission for Countering Extremism, which will 'support the government in stamping out extremist ideology in all its forms'.4,5 Already voices such as the Evangelical Alliance havepointed out that 'extremism' is a slippery concept andthere is no consensus about what it means. MightChristians holding biblical views on life issues andsexuality lie in its cross hairs? 'Hate speech' accusationsand reports of 'thought-policing' in the public service do not bode well. The government already 'has tried and failed in recent years to define extremism in a waythat tackles terrorism and its causes without restrictingfreedom of ideas'. 6 We are living in a post-Christian society where an atheistic mindset and the ethics of secular humanism havegrowing influence. The myth of secular neutrality holds that this is some kind of neutral default position, unlikethe 'faiths' of Christianity and Islam. And yet secular humanists have their own strong philosophical and ethical convictions that are based as much on ideology asevidence, and which exponents are forcing on othersusing political and legal mechanisms. 'Tolerance' once meant 'respectful disagreement'. Now it seems to mean 'affirm my beliefs and celebrate my behaviour or else'. The apostle Paul, speaking of a society that had similarly turned its back on God highlighted the linkbetween unbelief and moral decay in talking of men who 'suppress the truth by their wickedness', neither glorifyingGod nor thanking him and futile and foolish in their thinking. That generation was guilty of three ungodly'exchanges'. They exchanged 'the glory of the immortalGod for images', 'the truth of God for a lie' and 'natural relations for unnatural ones'. Homosexual acts were a key marker of such cultural decline - along with greed,depravity, envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice, slander, arrogance and hatred of God. 7 As a result, God 'gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done'. Is God similarly giving Britain over? If so, we can expect these challenges to increase in coming years - and as Christian doctors theneed to preach Christ and walk in his footsteps will be as great as ever. 'God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble. Therefore we will not fear...' 8 Peter Saunders is CMF Chief Executive.references 1. McCann K.

His condition is charac-terised by congenital deafness, severeepilepsy disorder and severe muscleweakness. His heart, liver and kidneys have also been affected and he is ventilatordependent. At the time of writing, Charlie isventilated in intensive care at Great OrmondStreet Hospital (GOSH). 1 In February GOSH applied to the High Court, asking for an order stating that it wouldbe 'lawful and in Charlie Gard's best interest'for artificial ventilation to be withdrawn. Theyadditionally said that nucleoside therapy wasnot in Charlie's best interest but suggested theprovision of palliative care. 2 Clinicians had initially planned to admin- ister nucleoside therapy in the UK but Charliestarted suffering from brain seizures and wasdiagnosed with epileptic encephalopathy. Subsequently, nucleoside therapy was deemed to be 'futile' if undertaken. Chris Gard and Connie Yates, Charlie's parents, opposed this application as they wished to travel to the US for experimentalnucleoside treatment, which has never been tested on anyone with Charlie's form ofMDDS or animal models. Through crowd-funding, they have raised \u00a31.3million fortreatment and found a clinician willing to doit. 3Dr I, the neurologist in the US, would like to 'offer what we can', and argues thatalthough 'it is unlikely to be of any benefit toCharlie's brain' he said the probability is 'lowbut not zero'. 2Mr Justice Francis ruled in favour of GOSH. Since the ruling, Charlie's parents have launched several legal challenges in the courtof appeal and the Supreme Court, in additionto the latest challenge in the European Courtof Human Rights (ECHR). On 27 June theECHR refused to intervene in the case ofCharlie Gard. 4 Balancing treatment and withdrawaldecisions, and acting in the best interests of children with complex medical histories, is extremely difficult and emotive for allinvolved. 5As Christian healthcare profes- sionals, regardless of legal decisions surrounding our patients' treatment, we must 'cloth ourselves with compassion'6for all those involved, our conversations should'always be full of grace and seasoned with salt'. 7Regardless of whether treatment is continued or withheld, caring must never stop - not only for a child, but also for their parents. We must also not forget that all human life is valuable regardless of severity of disability or prognosis. 1. NHS Foundation Trust. Frequently asked questions about the Charlie Gard court case .

Colossians 4:6BMA votes to decriminalise abortion The profession betrays its ethics Review by Peter Saunders CMF Chief Executive Charlie Gard Care and compassion in every situationReview by Rachel Owusu-Ankomah CMF Head of Student MinistriesOn Tuesday 27 June theBritish Medical Association(BMA) voted to support the decriminalisation of abortion throughout the UK. Delegates at the Annual Representative Meeting (ARM) in Bournemouth passed a six part motion by a two thirds majority. 1 1,500 doctors and medical students signed an open letter2urging the BMA not to go ahead and five female doctors, including CMF members, spoke courageously againstthe measure at the ARM, but to no avail. Currently, abortion is illegal in Britain under the Offences Against the Person Act1861 (OAPA). 3But under the Abortion Act 19674doctors can authorise abortions on several grounds relating to the health ofmother or baby. Although the Abortion Act was intended to be restrictive, its provisions are liberally inter- preted. One in every five pregnancies ends inabortion (190,406 in 2016) 5and 98% of these are carried out on 'mental health' grounds. Repealing sections 58 and 59 of the OAPAwould render the Abortion Act null and void, dismantling its entire regulatory framework - including the need for two doctors' signa- tures, the 24 week upper limit, the need for approved premises, licensed drugs,conscientious objection, reporting and accountability. Abortions could then be doneby anyone, for any reason, in any way and anywhere at any gestation up to 28 weeks. 6 If the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929,7 which makes it illegal to destroy a child'capable of being born alive', also fell (the act defines this as 28 weeks although many babies born as early as 23-24 weeks nowsurvive) abortion would be legal up to term. At the time of writing a new private member's bill is expected to be tabled in parliament to this effect. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), thecountry's leading abortion provider, and the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) have campaigned heavily for a change in the law in recent months and have been specific that they are campaigning for the removal of all gestational time limits. 8The Hippocratic Oath forbids abortion and ironically the BMA in 1947 called abortion 'the greatest crime'.9Sadly doctors have now become its most ardent promoters and facilitators. A recent ComRes poll showed that only 1% of women want the upper limit raised and 70% want it lowered to 20 weeks or below.10 Let's pray that parliament shows more respect for women and unborn babies than the BMA. 1.

In December 2016 the pharmacy regulator, the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC), issued new draft standards and guidance 2that changed the emphasis from a 'right to refer' to a 'duty to dispense', admitting that this represented 'a significant change'. During a consultation on this draft guidance, CMF and others had meetings with the GPhC and expressed concern about thelimiting effect of this new wording onconscience rights. We argued that the draftproposal to remove pharmacists' consciencerights was 'disproportionate, unethical,unnecessary and quite possibly illegal'. Wewere concerned that this move could alsohave repercussions for freedom of consciencefor doctors and nurses in the longer term. So, as Philippa Taylor notes in a detailedreview on the CMF Blog, 3we were relieved to see the final guidance issued on 22 June 2017: In practice: Guidance on religion, personal values and beliefs.4 The standards for pharmacy professionals require that they must ensure that 'person- centred care' is not 'compromised because of personal values and beliefs'. But the guidancenow makes it clear that: 'Pharmacy profes-sionals have the right to practise in line withtheir religion, personal values or beliefs' (p7)and clarifies that under Article 9 of theEuropean Convention on Human Rights(ECHR) a pharmacist's right to freedom ofthought, conscience and religion is protected. Crucially, there is now clear recognition that referral to another service provider isstill 'an appropriate option' with anemphasis on the importance of opennessand sensitive communication withcolleagues and employers. Encouragingly, in a statement accompa- nying the publication of the new guidance,the Chief Executive of the GPhC, DuncanRudkin, highlighted the positive contri-bution pharmacists' faith can make in their position of care: 'We recognise and respect that a pharmacy professional's religion, personal values and beliefs are often central to their lives and can make a positive contri- bution to their providing safe and effective care to a diverse population.' 5 Why did they revise it? It appears that they took note of CMF's submission and those of others. But a strong letter from theChristian Institute warning that the draft guidance was in breach of the law and thata judicial review was imminent no doubt also helped. It's a reminder that the price of freedom is eternal vigilance. 1. Saunders P. Pharmacists' regulator's proposal to remove conscience rights. Triple Helix 2017; Spring:3 bit.ly/2slmjHk 2. GPhC.

The former Ethiopian healthminister became the first African Head ofthe WHO on 30 June. 1 Why is this significant? Many question whether the WHO is still relevant or useful.2 After failing to respond swiftly to the West African Ebola outbreak in 2014-2015, 11,000lives were lost. Some have subsequentlyargued for it to be stripped of its role in responding to future global health crises. 3 Dr Tedros has a track record, as a health minister in Ethiopia, for cutting throughbureaucracy, increasing the healthworkforce, improving universal access andseeing significant progress in many globalhealth indicators. 4 However, his appointment is not withoutcontroversy. Many have pointed out hisinvolvement in a less than transparent Ethiopian regime with a bad human rights record, and which has been accused ofcovering up several cholera outbreaks. 5 He is also accused of being an advocate for abortion, and many pro-life organisa- tions in the global health community areconcerned that he may further liberalise the WHO stance on this issue. 6 It remains to be seen if the WHO's current openness to working with faith-based organisations and faith communities will continue under Dr Tedros' leadership.The Ethiopian government has had a mixedrecord in its dealings with faith commu-nities. 7While the WHO has a more positive recent relationship, we wait to see how Dr Tedros takes this forward. If the WHO is to have a role in the challenges of the coming decades, it will needinspired and credible leadership. It is too early to tell if Dr Tedros can supply this but, asRichard Horton has pointed out, it is not down to just one man. It is the wholeleadership team that he develops at the WHO who will drive and implement these changes. 8 The next few years will therefore show if the WHO can reform, regain its relevance, and be a friend to faith-based health work. We should pray for Dr Tedros as he takes up his post later this month, for the teamforming around him, and for the directionhe takes the WHO in the coming years. 1.

Thank God day by day as theauthor and giver of all that isgood.key points'Congratulations on owning a new iPhone 6!' Right then, a gushing 'congratulations' from the Applecall centre was the last thing I wanted to hear. With my beautiful new phonereduced to a sorry spider's web of cracked andsplintered glass, forget congratulations - I wantedcommiserations. And then I wanted answers. Could they mend it? Would rumours that it warranted a brand new replacement costing over \u00a3250 turn out to be true?How long would it take? And I wanted a response,please, in rather less than the 20 minutes alreadyspent being shifted around Apple support's robotalgorithms. And yet... as the conversation progressed I realised that the word 'congratulations' had workeda strange magic. At a stroke, it seemed, Apple'sscripted exercise in brand awareness had deflatedmy frustration, reframed my perspective, andsubverted my ego-absorption. I felt different. Overwhelmed by the small disappointment of a cracked screen (it turned out that it could easily be replaced) I'd forgotten that I was blessed to be among the top few percent of the world'spopulation for wealth and prosperity. Be thankful.OK, it was going to hurt my wallet to fix my newphone, as only Apple knows how, but I could affordit. It was my pride and need for control that was being hurt, not my wallet. Thanks for nothing? This trivial incident is a powerful reminder of the ways of the fallen heart and the medicine it needs.Shower us with the brightest and the best and we remain self-absorbed, discontented, ungratefulsouls. As Bart Simpson (from the irreverent US TVanimation The Simpsons) would say before supper: 'Dear God, we paid for all this stuff ourselves so thanks for nothing'. By contrast, the Bible presents the cultivation of gratitude as one of the core disciplines of the Christian life. 'Overflowing' with gratitude, we are called to give thanks 'always' and for 'everything' 1 in 'whatever [we] do'.2We are called to be grateful because it is the right thing to do: a spirit of thank-fulness acknowledges the sovereignty of God and asserts the dependency of his creatures. It positions grace at the very centre of our spiritual journey. Healthy gratitude But it turns out that cultivating a grateful spirit is a good thing to do as well. Psychologists are beginning to uncover how cultivating gratitudebenefits mental health and wellbeing. 3This must never be our primary motivation, of course, but FOR YOU Remember the grace- drenched context of your achievements - you did it in his strength, drawing on his encouragement and inspiration, motivated by his pleasure and delight.summer 2017 triple helix 7 summer 2017 triple helix 7these developments should encourage us on our journey. Here's how it works. Nuts and bolts First, gratitude changes our psychological posture.Like physical posture, our psychological posture (or mindset) is the way we incline toward the world. It determines what we see and how we seeit. Gratitude forces us to shift posture because it is a powerful subverter of the control, autonomy andentitlement that sits so naturally with the fallenmind. Being thankful creates a state of psychological dissonance. You cannot cede control in gratitudewhilst at the same moment grasping onto it. Youcannot recognise the gracious act of the giver whilstasserting your entitlement to their gift. It's one or the other - you cannot have both. The act of saying'thank you' dispels pride and entitlement, insteadnudging us toward the virtues of humility, depen-dence and submission. Second, gratitude appears to exert a positive effect on mood and general wellbeing. For example, in one of his studies in this area, the psychologistRobert Emmons randomised subjects to one ofthree journaling tasks. 4Those in the first group were instructed to keep a record of the events andcircumstances of the day for which they weregrateful and then to meditate thankfullyby 'counting their blessings'; the second kept arecord of 'hassles of the day'; and the third a list of neutral events. When Emmons compared theoutcomes across a range of mental health indicatorsseveral weeks later, the gratitude group scoredsignificantly higher in several sectors, reporting a more positive and optimistic mood overall. Let's be clear, learning to cultivate gratitude in this way isn't a cure-all and it is unlikely to makemuch impression on entrenched depression. Wedon't know how well benefits are sustained over the longer term. And it is probably better to start to practise the discipline of gratitude in this waywhen life is going well, rather than in the depths ofdespair or when confronting trauma and loss. Thisis a liturgy that needs to be cultivated gradually, day by day, month my month, year after year: patientlyreconstructing a psychological posture of thank-fulness. But what might a regular liturgy of contemplative gratitude look like? It starts rst with the decision,let's say for ten minutes every day, to inhabit thepresent moment. Gratitude wrenches us out of thefuture, with its endless planning, and forces us backinto the present. Put down the iPhone, close thecalendar, put aside the 'to-do' list and pause inGod's presence. Second, think intentionally about what is good: about God, the gospel and about your life circum-stances right now. Literally counting our blessingsin this way imposes a positive cognitive filter on ourrelationship with the world, forcing us to golooking, intentionally, for what is good. It summonsus to locate, and then to contemplate, the 'tenthousand places' where we happen upon the grace of Christ every day of our lives. GK Chesterton, for example, revelled in the goodness that he discovered dancing everywhere around him: 'I like the cyclostyle ink, it is so inky. I do not think there is anyone who takes such fierce pleasure in things being themselves as I do. The startling wetness of water excites me; the fieriness of fire, the steeliness of steel, the unutterable muddiness of mud...' The language of gratitude forces us to slow into the present moment, to discern what is true, what is noble, what is right, pure, lovely, admirable - andthen to notice them. 5 Third, and finally, offer words of thanks to God as the author and giver of all that is good. Takemoments to imagine his gracious face, his open,bountiful nature, and his self-giving posture ofgenerosity. Affirm the gifts around you as tangibleevidence of his goodness - see them, touch them,savour them. Say thank you over and over, moving back and forth between the gift and the giver. Achievement? A posture of thankfulness should not undermine a sense of personal achievement built upon our efforts and determination. When the fruits of ourlabour have blessed others, and brought life to the world, we should stand ready to receive theirgratitude as well as praise from God himself. But then pause to remember the grace-drenched context of your achievements - you did it in hisstrength, drawing on his encouragement and inspi- ration, motivated by his pleasure and delight. Youprobably used the fruits of other people's labour too - the Chinese technician who assembled thekeyboard on which you write, the Brazilian sailorwho manned the container ship that carried itacross oceans, the Polish van driver who knockedon your door. Give thanks for them and for theirlabour. Position your efforts in the context of thesovereignty of God - for what do you have (your skills, aptitudes, even your dogged determination)that you did not in some sense also receive? 6 Training the heart That's it. Ten minutes a day is a long time for an ungrateful heart. But if we want to train the heart toaim well, to default in the midst of life's challengeswith a godly spirit of thankfulness, here is a liturgythat is right and good. Good for you, good forothers and good for the life of the world. And as anadded bonus, after a few years, the ink may beginto appear a little, well, inkier.

I am more likely to imagine that good sleep is a result of my metabolism, genes or occasional discipline in getting to bed early. But the Bible encourages us to celebrate God's provision and grace, even in such small things.7 It's certainly a more affir- mative start to the day! The doctors clubbed together to buy our operations teamsmall gifts at Christmas. Wewere embarrassed by expres- sions of how much it meant tothem. Medical staff gets lots of appreciation and praise. In contrast the back room staff are often overlooked and invisible. Without their tireless efforts in chasing and expediting the thankless tasks, the NHS would grind to a halt. There are examplesin the Bible of our heavenly father taking care toremember the names of faithful workers such as the Hebrew midwives in Exodus,Shiphrah and Puah. 8We all like to be remembered with an occasional thank you. Alex Bunn8 triple helix summer 20178 triple helix summer 2017 8triple helix summer 2017 image Rhona Knight assesses the modern-day obsession with the quest for physical perfection MIRROR, Our society rushes to make judgments of people based on appearance. People's quest for physicalperfection, howeverculturally defined, seems to have soared in the last two decades. Jesus' Great Commandmenthighlights the need toremember that we areholistic beings, who are to love God not only withbodies, but with heart, soul and mind too.key points 'Mirror, mirror on the wall, who in the land is fairest of all?' Mirrors are not a new invention. From the polished metal mirrorsof 600 BC to the mirrors wehave in our homes today, surfaces that reflect, that mirror, enable us to gazeat our own appearance. 'Mirrors' now include:phone screens or 'selfies', shop windows and reflective sunglasses. It has been estimated that a man spends 45 days of his life shaving. Women, on average, are said to look at their reflection eight times a day 1and spend 55 minutes a day (or two weeks a year) on their appearance.2 What are we looking for? When we look in the mirror, what are we looking at? What are we looking for? For many it is aboutensuring that we are presentable. That we don'thave toothpaste round our mouth or somethingstuck between our teeth. For some it will beplucking stray eyebrow hair or trimming facial hair.But we also look in the full length mirror. Does thesuit fit properly? Do the shirt and tie match? Doesmy bum look big in this? How big is the baldpatch? We are aware that in the world we live in, appearance makes a difference. People makejudgments based on our appearance, 3to the extent that it seems good appearance results in higherincome and better jobs. 4There is the recurrent question of what doctors should wear to work: does appearance have an impact on patient care? 5Yet, for healthcare professionals and patients alike, appearance can become an idol, a fixation. It can become a key factor in determining a person's perception of their worthiness to be loved. While mirrors reflect images clearly, they can also encourage something more insidious: dissatisfaction. People bemoan body shape, facialblemishes and age-appropriate wrinkles. Milddental asymmetry and slightly yellowed teeth takeon disproportionate importance. A British Social Attitudes Survey noted the public's concern about body confidence and its contribution to compro-mised well being. 6It also explored the issue of self- objectification, where people find their self-worth in how other people judge their appearance.Dissatisfaction with appearance has a huge impacton men, women and, increasingly, children. Headlines include stories of school photographersoffering to photoshop primary school children'sschool photographs. 7The Girl Guides annual survey regularly identifies the perceived importance of looks and pressures to conform.8In the 2016 survey, 47% of girls indicated that the way they looked held them back most of the time.9 Nothing new under the sun The aspiration towards physical perfection is not new. Aristotle was quoted in a British MuseumExhibition, Defining beauty: the body in ancient Greek art, 10as seeing the chief forms of beauty as 'order, symmetry and clear delineation'. In ancient Greece, citizens would have been exposed to society's viewof the perfect body in marble statues. Lucian of Samosata wrote in the second century: 'The young men have a tanned complexion from the sun, MIRROR We are aware that in the world we live in, appearance makes a difference.summer 2017 triple helix 9 summer 2017 triple helix 9 summer 2017 triple helix 9manly faces; they reveal spirit, fire, manliness... They maintain their bodies vigorously'.11 Yet while the quest for perfection, however culturally defined, may not be new, it does seem to have soared in the last two decades. The UK cosmetics market was worth \u00a39,379 million in 2016.12 That said, cosmetic surgery procedures fell 40% in 2016 with more people opting for non-surgical'enhancing' such as Botox and teeth whitening. 13 Cosmetic dentistry has shown an exponentialgrowth in the last 10-15 years. 14 The quest for the perfect face and body appears to be fuelled by several factors.15Print and film media, including pornography, portray the culturallydefined 'perfect' human body. This can create asense of inadequacy for healthcare professionals and patients alike as unrealistic expectations areplaced upon people that can't match the tweakedand airbrushed images that our society idealises. In the current culture of perfectionism it is easy for people to live under the tyranny of believing thatperfection is possible. 16In perceiving the 'perfect' to be available, the image of 'perfection' becomesmore desirable, serving to magnify the feelings of discontentment. Cosmetic surgery advertising and television programmes have been shown to have a negativeimpact on women and girls' body image. 17Social media is also playing an increasingly prominent part. A recent report, #StatusOfMind, examined the positive and negative effects of social media onyoung people's health, with one of the issues beingbody image. Instagram and Snapchat were found tobe the most negative, as the Chief Executive of theRoyal Society for Public Health commented: 'It'sinteresting to see Instagram and Snapchat rankingas the worst for mental health and wellbeing - bothplatforms are very image-focused and it appearsthey may be driving feelings of inadequacy andanxiety in young people'. 18The prevailing belief that 'improvement' of appearance can boost self-esteemmay also perversely encourage discontentment andunhelpful comparison to others. Because I am not worth it? Glynn Harrison explores the slippery concept of self-esteem in his book The Big Ego Trip. Along with the growth of the self-esteem movement, we havealso seen a growth in individualism and narcissism,as scored by personality assessment tools. 19Self- esteem is well defined by Alister and JoannaMcGrath as 'a global evaluation or judgment aboutpersonal acceptability and worthiness to be loved...strongly related to the perceived views of the personby important others in his or her life'. 20In a society which values appearance it partly determines howpeople view their self-worth. Technology is added into this mix. There is scope not just to restore what has been damaged or totreat something which compromises health andwellbeing but the option to shape, mould or'enhance' appearance. Anabolic steroids, Botox,dermal fillers and cosmetic surgery promise this. A milieu has emerged which encourages people's dissatisfaction with their normal, reflected appearance. At a time when the 'because you're worth it' 21attitude is growing, the cosmetic and enhancing markets seems to be booming preciselybecause people do not really believe the strapline - they do not think they're worth it. Be perfect as your Heavenly Father is perfect The Old Testament describes the societal importance of physical beauty, as the book of Esther bearswitness, describing the intense period of preparationof each aspiring bride before her night with the king.Whilst acknowledging the value put by society on external beauty, the Bible also indicates the truenature of beauty: 'for the Lord does not see as mortals see... the Lord looks on the heart'. 22Clearly internal beauty matters more to God than external. Yet, as Richard Winter points out, 'it is not wrong to enjoy high standards... It is not wrong to strive for excellence in life and not all perfectionism is wrong'.23Jesus exhorts his listeners to be perfect as their Heavenly Father is perfect,24he is seen as the author and perfecter of faith.25Paul exhorts his readers to run the race in order to win the prize.26 However the perfection talked about here is ratherdifferent from the perfection sought in the mirror.The Greek word used for perfect in Matthew andHebrews, teleios, is more about completeness and fulfilled purpose. It echoes the Old Testamentconcept of shalom and emphasises holistic flour- ishing. The greatest commandment highlights the need to remember that humans are holistic beings,who are to love God not only with bodies, but withheart, soul and mind as well. In focusing exclusivelyon the physical, the dignity of humanity is under- mined. We are a temple of the Holy Spirit Above the mirror on the wall of a house I visitedrecently was written the word 'saint'. A helpful reminder that human beings, made in the image of God and possessing intrinsic dignity, need to avoid idolising the human body and treating it as a consumer product to be fashioned and moulded inour own desired image. Yet as saints, Christians arestill works in progress, needing to resist being sweptaway by the flow of the zeitgeist striving for perfectappearance. More positively, there is the necessityto recollect the true nature of the body, a temple of the Holy Spirit. 27Instead of being imprisoned by society's view of beauty we need to remember thatwhere the Spirit of the Lord is there is freedom, andthat all of us 'with unveiled faces, seeing the gloryof the Lord as though reflected in a mirror, arebeing transformed into the same image from onedegree of glory to another'. 28 Having been a GP educator and academic for 25 years,Rhona Knight is now serving as an assistant curate in the parish of Sleaford.

Christians need to understand the world we live in and learnto listen. To some extent what youpost on social media reflectswhat you love.key pointsWe live in changing times. It is a biblical requirement that we seek to understand the times and be salt and light in the world we live in, rather than the world we wished we lived in, or the world we used to livein. One of the phenomenal changes in 21st century Britain is the fact that we are now a 'wired'community. Most newspapers are in decline, the days of families all sitting round together to watch the newson one of four TV stations have disappeared. Nowwe are in the era of the Internet, Wikipedia, Googleand social media. We have access to knowledge that our forefathers could only have dreamed of. Yet instead of ending up in a progressive enlightened nirvana we are in the era of fake news,'post-truth' politics and people living increasinglyisolated lives. People live within self-defined socialmedia bubbles which prevent them ever thinkingabout ideas and values outside their own prejudices.In this article I want to take a particular look at thequestion of social media and how doctors, nursesand students can use social media for the benefit of the gospel. First of all we need to understand the kind of world that we live in today. We must be those who are constantly observing, reading and learning. Before we talk we need to learn to listen (always agood practice for medical staff anyway). There are five trends we should be aware of: Secular utopianism: There are those who believe we are on the verge of entering a liberal, progressive utopia. It is a form of secularism that is largely atheistic and based upon the incrediblefaith that human beings are essentially good and are progressing towards a better world. This secular utopianism is fundamentallyilliberal and not open to question. Religious fundamentalism: Religion is not the whole or even the main problem. But neither is it the solution. The truth is that religions can doa great deal of harm. We should be concerned with what is true, not with what is religious. State fascism: Whilst British society has in the past flirted with the notion of a theocratic state, or an absolutist government, in general we have FAITH Before we talk we need to learn to listen (always a good practice for medical staff anyway).summer 2017 triple helix 11 summer 2017 triple helix 11 summer 2017 triple helix 11been a secular society that was founded upon Christian principles. Church and State weregood neighbours and good friends. Neither hadabsolute power. The trouble is that with theremoval of Christianity as the conscience of thenation, it is allowing the creeping absolutism ofthe State. If you remove God and replace himwith the State you will end up with some kindof fascist corporate all-powerful state. Consumerist dumbed-down materialism: Totalitarian states can only survive if the controlmechanisms are strong and the populacesatisfied. People in Britain today are told theycan be whatever they want to be, but for manythat is just Disney-esque waffle. Drugs, 15minutes of fame on reality TV, sex, smartphones, and widescreen TVs are the only thingsoffered. Our elites don't tell us to eat cake, theydon't offer us bread and circuses, but they dopresume that we will be happy living dumbed- down mediocre lives with the cultural crumbsfrom their table. The danger is that we end upwith this collectivist mindset where people arescared to think for themselves and just go alongwith the prevailing zeitgeist. Sexual confusion and dysfunctional families: The sexual 'liberation' of the 1960s has turnedout to be anything but liberating for the vastmajority of people. Instead of progressing weare regressing to a Greco/Roman/Pagan view. In that world there was sexual exploitation,slavery, diseases, dysfunctional families, children born out of wedlock, child abuse and dominance of the poor by the rich. It is important that we understand the big picture, as it is the backdrop to the engagements we havewith individuals. So let's turn to social media. Social media is a blessing and a curse On the negative side it can be pathetically trivial,time wasting and divisive. One basic principle Isuggest from bitter experience is don't conduct a serious argument over the Internet. Social media,despite all the emojis, cannot convey tone orhumanity. Given that so much of human communi-cation is tone, expression and body language (some studies suggest up to 70% - again, a note for medical staff - how you convey the message is almost as important as the message itself),Facebook and Twitter are wide open to misunder-standing, anger and abuse. On the positive side, Facebook is great to connect with people. It's good for advertising events and auseful tool for communicating the gospel. Thisdoesn't mean that you have to post scripture versesevery day but, to some degree, what you postreflects what you love. If all I read on your FB pageis your latest meal then I will tend to see you as asomewhat shallow, if not gluttonous, person. Youalso need to be very patient - and avoid postingitems just to get 'likes'. Over the years I have had many conversations with people because of articles, music and YouTube clips posted through socialmedia. I still love to give people books but recognise that not everyone has the time to read. At Solas Online we developed some video 'shorts', 3-4 minutes clips (sometimes just one minute)looking at some of the big questions. 1 Why not use them or find other good resources that can act as discussion starters? The point is notthat this is dumbing down, but rather that this is a kind of pre-evangelism, or indeed even advertising. And that is how you should consider social media.It is a public means, not of putting every detail of your personal life (why would you want to and whydo you think people would be interested?!), but of sharing in the public square issues of general andpersonal interest. Let's return to where we began. If we live in an increasingly dumbed-down, shallow and self-absorbed society, where people only listen to thosewho already agree with them (something that canhappen in the church too), how do we connect withit, and break through the barriers of prejudice, indif-ference, ignorance and even hostility? One tool -and I stress it is only one - is social media. Instead of the constant tide of worldly and anti- Christian values which our society is drowning in, why not just have the gentle drip, drip, drip of the grace of Christ and his gospel? Post things that cause people to question. Not just the aggressive'you're all doomed and going to hell in a handcart'type rhetoric; but rather post stories, images andwords which hint at a different world, a betterreality. We need to be honest. Not everything isrosy in the Christian garden but we need to behumble, joyous, intelligent and provocative. We need to show that we wrestle with the same issuesbut come at it from a very different perspective. Our aim is surely to point people towards Christ. Beware the pitfalls of social media, but again as any good doctor would say, 'everything in moder-ation'. If you get caught up in an alternative onlineworld, take an occasional fast and be disciplined inyour use of words and time, then you will find that it can be a great means to share the gospel. One final piece of advice. Before you can give out, you need to receive in... or the well will soon rundry. Be often in prayer and in the Word. Be acommitted and serving part of a faithful livelyfellowship. Read good books. Live in and enjoyGod's world. And when your heart is overflowingyou will have something to share. Or rather you will have someone to share.

BMA Social media practical guidance and best practice, 2017 bit.ly/2r5fN76 The General Medical Council (GMC) and Nursing & Midwifery Council(NMC) have produced detailed guidance on the use of social mediaby health professionals. Doctorsand nurses use social media in both personal and professional contexts,and both bodies are positive about the constructive use of social media. However, they also highlight the particular dangers and bound- aries that should exist for all healthprofessionals. As a general rule, keep private and professional use separate - use different accounts or media for each. Do not accept friend or follower requests from patients (present or past). Do not post publicly any material relating to patients or colleagues. Do not use social media for whistle- blowing or raising concerns, butfollow professional guidelines. Always be aware that your social media activity online (personal and professional) can reflect on you as aprofessional for current and future employers. All that you post or share will be there for perpetuity. So always think before you post!

Christians need to affirmwhat it means to be human,made in the image of God,and what it means to bemachine. AI and robotics will bringabout many ethical questions,which Christian healthcareprofessionals should start aconversation about. key pointsAs a child growing up in the 1960s I was an avid reader of science- based predictions of the future. By the year 2000 hover-cars, colonies on the moon, free power through nuclear fusion and robot workers were all forecast. The problem for humankind would be how to fill the endlesshours of leisure time once limitless resources andenergy were on tap. Sadly reality turned out to be somewhat different. Yet nobody in the 1960s predicted mobile phones,personal computers, or the all-pervasive nature,power and global spread of the Internet, let alone virtual reality and cloud computing. What we do know is that computer technology has been doubling in power every 18-24 monthssince the 1960s and this rate of improvement ispredicted to continue. Massive investmentsamounting to trillions of dollars are currently goinginto AI and robotics, not just in the US but in Japan, China, India, Europe and across the world. AI is already having a significant impact on our lives, butmuch of this is invisible. Behind the scenes they aresupervising our computer searches, selecting theadverts we see online, trading in financial markets,flying commercial aircraft and translating books. The fundamental driving force behind these remarkable changes is laissez faire capitalism - maximising shareholder value. Intelligentautomation optimises speed and productivity whilstminimising expense. AIs can work 24/7 withoutgetting tired, they don't demand pay raises, are lesslikely to make mistakes and their function doesn'tdeteriorate with repetition. Rather, they areconstantly learning and improving on the job -increasing accuracy and efficiency. Above all, unlikehuman workers, they are infinitely scalable. Onceyou have one intelligent machine performing a taskeffectively you can very rapidly expand. So althoughthe speed with which automation will enter healthcare is debatable, the ultimate direction seems clear - the inexorable logic of the market economy will ultimately triumph. It is said that computer giant IBM has invested over a billion dollars in healthcare applications for their powerful AI system Watson. The system is capable of extracting and analysing informationfrom free text: thousands of unmodified patient records, genomics databases and the entire scientificand medical literature. The system is currently being used to assist experienced oncologists in the USA, providing diagnosis and treatment options. Watsonis constantly learning and improving its accuracy from collaboration with experienced clinicians. One physician was quoted as saying: 'One of the amazing revelations was how much like a learned colleague the system can be'. The Watson system 'understands' natural language and speech and uses the context to determine meaning. IBM claim that a system that has been trained with experienced US oncologists can be used by ajunior doctor working in a developing country toobtain the same degree of accuracy in diagnosis and treatment decisions. This kind of technology has enormous potential in increasing access to expert knowledge and advice across the world. The technology will provide a 'democratisation' ofexpert medical knowledge that was previously thedomain of a few highly-paid specialists. But vast sums have been invested in the development ofthese AI systems. They have high commercial value in privatised health systems and will concentrateeconomic power in a small number of extremely wealthy high-tech companies. DeepMind, a British AI company owned by Google, is collaborating with a number of UKhospitals developing algorithms to interpret head and neck scans at UCL Hospital and retinal images MACHINE Does it matter if 'compassion' or 'friendship' is simulated, a product of clever programming? Who is harmed?summer 2017 triple helix 13 summer 2017 triple helix 13 summer 2017 triple helix 13at Moorfields Eye Hospital. The system learns how to identify potential abnormalities within the scans,and how to recommend the right course of action to a clinician. As AIs become pervasive withinhealthcare systems, issues of legal control, privacy,copyright and responsibility for malpractice arelikely to become more problematic. The ubiquity of smartphones together with tiny smart sensors and cloud computing will enablesophisticated personal health data tracking. It'sclaimed that this technology, combined with BigData and cloud-based expert systems, will allow early diagnosis and continuous monitoring of manymedical conditions. For instance, tissue glucosereadings can be obtained and analysed in real-timein the cloud, giving real-time warning of hypogly-caemic risk and individualised advice on appropriatemanagement. Some believe that in future manymedical consultations will take place using smart-phones, home sensors and AI systems with accessto NHS-wide data and continuous machinelearning from user inputs. The AI could decide whatquestions to ask, and then use a Bayesian statistical approach to give a probabilistic diagnosis andrecommend therapies. Human clinicians may onlybe involved if the systems cannot solve the problem. In the field of caring for patients it is very likely that different forms of robotics and AIs will increas- ingly be seen as providing human-like compan- ionship. Systems are being developed to recognisehuman emotions using powerful face and speechrecognition software and to respond in real-time to these emotions. These systems can be virtual -existing purely as an avatar (a human-like form on a screen), or a disembodied voice like Amazon'sAlexa. But they may also be in a physical andembodied form, for instance as a 'cute' child-likerobot. It seems likely that companionship systems will be promoted as technological solutions for 'caring', providing 24 hour supervision and 'friendship' forthe elderly, the disabled, babies and infants, those with mental health problems and maybe ordinarypeople who feel lonely or isolated. Some haveemphasised that social robots are meant to partner with humans and should be designed to 'supporthuman empowerment'. When used correctly, it isargued that social robots can even be a catalyst forhuman-human interaction. Christian responses Much of this may seem like science fiction and it iscertainly true that it is difficult to distinguishbetween hype and reality. But there's a clear drivefor increasing automation and behind these devel-opments there are deep philosophical and culturalprocesses. In particular, there seems to be aprogressive blurring and merging of concepts inwhat it means to be human and what it means tobe a machine. Blurring human and machine Modern academic disciplines, such as cognitivepsychology and computational neuroscience, use advances in AI as a means of understanding howthe human brain works. The fundamental concept,put at its crudest, is that the brain is a 'computermade out of meat'. The more we understand how computers work, the more we can understand howthe human brain works. This approach has beenstrikingly successful, leading to major advances in brain science and cognitive psychology. Yet, we are increasingly trying to comprehend what it means to be an intelligent machine in the light of our human experience. Our strong and in- built tendency is to anthropomorphise intelligent machines - attributing human-like characteristics to them. We instinctively think of them as looking out at the world as we do, having a 'self' with intentionsand goals. One troubling aspect of anthropomor-phism is that it is not under conscious control; ourresponse is instantaneous and deeply emotionallyengaging. Some months ago I was with a group of senior church leaders who were debating thetheological implications of AI and robotics. Wevisited a computer lab in which a group of small child-like robots were active - speaking, waving and moving around on the floor. Instantly theatmosphere changed - people waved back, laughing and responding, and a senior bishop got down onhis hands and knees and started engaging delightedly with the robots, as though they were precious and vulnerable children. The irony is that our very humanity makes us open and vulnerable to manipulation by human-like machines. The aim of many AI and roboticsdesigners is to encourage anthropomorphism - notso much in making the physical appearance indis-tinguishable from human, but in simulating charac- teristics such as emotional intelligence and respon-siveness, memory, humour, and a sense of personalidentity. 1. Understanding and critiquing of modern technology A common understanding of technology sees itmerely as a neutral tool, like a hammer which canbe used equally for good or evil. But in reality the power, widespread reach and hiddenness ofadvanced technology in our lives means that itchanges and manipulates the world we see.Technology generates a 'reality distortion field'. On the one hand modern technology can be seen as a fulfilment of the creation mandates given to thefirst humans by the Creator: 'Be fruitful... fill theearth and subdue it'. 1As such we need to celebrate the extraordinary achievements and promise ofdigital technology in modern healthcare. But wecan't be na\u00efve about the hidden power plays, andthe invasion of privacy. So before we accept newand powerful technological innovations in medicalpractice, perhaps we need to ask detailed questionsabout transparency, vested interests, privacy issues,and potential dehumanising consequences. As CSLewis put it: 'Man's power over nature turns out tobe power exerted by some men over men'. 2robots/AI We need to celebrate the extraordinary achievements and promise of digital technology in modern healthcare. But we can't be na\u00efve about the hidden power plays.14 triple helix summer 2017The early chapters of Genesis see both the positive life-enhancing impact of technology in the flowering of metal-working and instrument- making, and its malign counterpart in the profound and mysterious story of the tower of Babel. Perhaps this ancient story has a fresh relevance in a worldwhere computing technology is providing a newand powerful global language: 'The Lord said, behold they are one people and they all have one language and this is only the beginning of what they will do'. 3 2. Resisting the conceptual blurring between our created, embodied humanity and intelligent machines It seems inevitable that AI technology will become increasingly effective at simulating aspects ofhuman intellectual, emotional and relational behaviour. Technology will be capable of providing physical and virtual companions, colleagues,teachers, therapists, carers and playmates. But this will raise complex and troubling issues. Think of an elderly person with dementia feeling lonely,confused and abandoned. She finds a wonderful new companion who makes her feel loved andcared for: a strange friend who seems compas-sionate, thoughtful, wise and fun to be with. Hermood improves and she becomes more interactiveand engaged with her environment.Simultaneously, the robot companion is covertly recording and analysing all of the patient's behaviour and sending it to a central control facility. Does it matter if 'compassion' or 'friendship' is simulated, a product of clever programming? Whois harmed? If simulated companions can allowelderly people to remain in their own homes ratherthan being admitted to a care facility, wouldn't thisbe acceptable? What ethical values should beimplanted in autonomous caring systems? It also seems inevitable that AI, virtual reality and robotic technology will enable people to act out sexual and violent fantasies. Should an adult with paedophilia be allowed to abuse a child robot? After all, who is harmed? Is it possible to torture a robot? To what extent am I damaging my own humanity when I mistreat a human-like machine? Behind these developments lies a conceptual and emotional blurring between the human person andthe intelligent machine. It clearly is true that thereare aspects of our humanity, including our thinkingprocesses, which are machine-like. But to understand ourselves as though we are machines is a new andsubtle form of idolatry. It is to worship the productsof human ingenuity in place of the Creator. InChristian thinking human beings are unique in thecosmos because they are created in God's image, as embodied reflections of another reality. And thegoodness of our embodied humanity is vindicatedand reinforced in the miracles of the incarnationand resurrection, when God himself takes on ourhumanity and is raised as a physical, recognisableand touchable human being.In the ancient words of the Nicene Creed, the Church Fathers developed the profound under- standing that Christ was begotten not made. Christ was not part of the creation; he was the only begotten Son of the Father. That which we makeis a product of our will and is ours to control. Children we give birth to are a gift, a product of our nature, and equal to us in dignity and significance. However sophisticated the machines we develop,they are still products of our will to be controlled and used for good. 3. We need to develop resilience to the dehumanising and manipulative possibilities of technology We are so immersed in technology that it is almostimpossible to comprehend its all-pervasive natureand influence on our lives and on our practice as health professionals. Whilst we look forward to increasingly powerful diagnostic, therapeutic and caring opportunities, I think it will be important for Christians to develop techniques of resilience andresistance to the dehumanising and manipulative possibilities of technology in the world of healthcare. Perhaps we will need to develop arguments in favour of real human carers rather than simulated ones, real human relationships infavour of simulated compassion and real experi- ences in place of virtual reality. At the very least Christian people need to start having the conver- sation as to how we might respond to thesestartling developments. And in the face of apocalyptic fears about a future world in which malign technology has taken over, we need to remind ourselves that God remains thesupreme Lord of history. The biblical narrative from original creation to the new creation is stillunderway. Human artefacts and technology have a part to play in his purposes, but ultimately it is God himself who will bring in the reality of the New Jerusalem, seen in the final chapters of Revelation, and in the final destruction of Babylon, the home of all deceptions, idolatries and counterfeits.

Is this an important liberty tobe safeguarded, or an unwarranted privilege which interferes with patient care? Must we leave our conscience at the door of our professional life? These are some of the prescient questions currently being discussed in the medicalethics literature. It should concern all those who care about liberty and integrity that the debate is skewed heavily in favour of those who wish to seethe end of conscientious objection. One representative of this side isFrancesca Minerva, a scholar based in Belgium. She has previouslyadvocated the inducement of Italian doctors with financial rewardsto practice abortion, 1and co-authored the infamous paper on 'after-birth abortion'.2Her most recent paper in the Journal of Medical Ethics caught my attention.3 In it she argues that cosmetic surgeons are not at liberty to decline to perform any procedure, even if it goes against their better judgment - and even if it is 'ugly-fying'. Essentially, patient prefer- ences have priority over clinical judgment: the patient's right to request treatment is near absolute, while the doctor's right to refuse is practically non-existent. The Journal of Medical Ethics published my response to Minerva's arguments, which I briefly recapitulate below.4 Firstly, even passing familiarity with medicine indicates that Minerva's proposal is unrealistic. Patients do not have an absoluteright of request, even if they are willing to pay (and I don't believe thatany doctor would endorse such a right). Doctors, as the gatekeepers of healthcare, shoulder the responsibility of deciding who needs ordoes not need a scan, test or procedure. These things are not ordinary consumables. They are often risky, and require expertise to co-ordinate and decide upon. Doctors are not mere mediators ofmedicine, but active agents. It is impossible to get around this. Secondly, Minerva's conception of autonomy is mistaken. Patients have a right to say no to treatment, but not an absoluteright to request whatever they wish. For example, a capaciouspatient with a brain tumour can decline a biopsy offered to him.This sort of negative autonomy is fundamental. But absolute positive autonomy is in the realm of fantasy. If a man with a gouty toe requests the amputation of his foot, his surgeon is under noobligation to comply because amputation is unnecessarily harmful.Moreover, to fulfil his request with this knowledge would be toinvite severe criticism of one's integrity. Thirdly, absolute positive autonomy makes the idea of benevolence redundant. If a doctor's basic duty is to maximise patient preferences, he no longer need think about what it means to do good to his neighbour. Minerva's underlying assumption, it seems, is that human happiness is found in preference satisfaction; it is nothing more thana feeling. Is it beneficent to perform invasive surgery unnecessarily just because it is requested? To give a positive answer, one requires a severely limited account of human flourishing. Fourthly, it has been the strategy of those who oppose conscien- tious objection to frame it as a purely moral or religious matter. But doctors make 'moral' judgments every day when they decide on a patient's care plan, on what is a good course of action. And if a doctor objects to a certain treatment based on his clinical judgment, is he to be harangued for interfering patient access to care? It's doubtful. A patient might be entitled in law to a particular treatment, but a doctor's considered professional opinion can lead to it being withheld. Expertise informs opinion regarding what isright. This is not far from 'usual' conscientious objection, but is normally called clinical judgment. Could it be that the two are somehow related? Fifthly, the goals of medicine deserve consideration. If medicine is anything which improves our subjective sense of wellbeing, as the WHO would put it, 5then there really is no scope for refusing anything at all, since all refusal would be a desertion of duty. But a reasonable definition of the goals of medicine, which distinguishes between restoring health and enhancing lifestyle, permits the possi- bility of saying no to what is beyond the scope of medicine (andtherefore not one's professional duty). Interventions which do notrestore health include elective abortion, euthanasia, prescribingcontraception, sterilisation, cosmetic surgery and ritual circumcision. Pregnancy, frailty, fertility, genitalia and plainness are not diseases in need of 'treatment'. Hence, a doctor should have the liberty tosay no to participating in them. Much more could and has been said about conscientious objection. There is ample cause for concern; the momentum is not on the side of conscience. Christians should seriously consider the matter, as must all people who care about liberty and personal integrity, and make a reasoned defence of it in the public square.There may come a time we are forced to participate in evil, or forcedto face the consequences of not doing so. Thankfully, such is not yetthe case, but we must prepare for the increasingly likely eventuality. Toni Saad is a medical student at Cardiff University. 1. Minerva F. Conscientious objection in Italy.

The battle against arrogance and insecurity may be particularly potent. Christian registrars, knowingtheir identity in Christ, canthink of themselves less andenjoy the freedom of servingGod and others. key pointsYou're with a sick patient in the Emergency Department and aren't sure how best to manage her.You've still got three specialty referrals to see, plus letters to dictate fromyesterday's clinic. One of the junior doctors on yourteam seems to be struggling, and keeps asking foryour help. Your consultant doesn't seem to like youand criticised the management of one of your patients earlier in the day. Plus the audit you'resupposed to be completing hasn't moved forwardsin the last month and your annual appraisal is nextweek. The bleep never seems to stop. As a registrar, it's easy to feel like you are stuck in the middle of a complex web of responsibilitythat makes it inevitable that you will disappointsomeone at some point, if not most people most ofthe time. Forget their standards - you even struggleto meet your own. You look at some of your peerswith envy; they seem so calm and sorted as theyjuggle clinical responsibilities with aplomb. And yet it's not always so dire - just a few weeks ago you made two brilliant diagnoses on one wardround, felt totally on top of all your patients. Youwere commended by your boss for the calm withwhich you handled an emergency that developedon the ward. 'Phew', you overheard one of thehouse officers say as you arrived on the ward, mentioning your name reverentially. 'He's alegend!' It's not easy to fulfil a role that remains, despite all the recent changes in the structure of healthcare, critical to the running of most hospitals. You are given significant responsibility - and yet remain accountable to a consultant who may have strong views on how they expect you to perform. You havesome role in managing a team of juniors, and yetmight be acutely aware that you were at their stageof training until very recently. Opportunities toshine for Christ are everywhere. Yet never far away lies spiritual danger: the arrogance that can come from over-estimating your own importance, or theinsecurity of feeling as if no matter how hard youtry, you will never be good enough. In his first letter to the church in Corinth, Paul writes to believers divided into factions and rivalallegiances to different leaders - 'I follow Paul', 'I follow Apollos', 'I follow Cephas'. 1In the first three chapters, he traces out the root cause of theproblem: pride. The status they accorded to these Christian leaders was a form of boasting 2- they were puffed up (the Greek word physio used literally means 'inflated'),3because they had associated themselves with one or other of these 'Christian STOPsummer 2017 triple helix 17 summer 2017 triple helix 17 summer 2017 triple helix 17celebrities'. In the same way, in hospitals the big characters - perhaps especially at registrar level -can be boasted of in the same way by their juniors. In the context of this speculation about the relative merits of these different Christian leaders, with all the potential inherent in such comparisonsto fuel arrogance or insecurity, Paul explains how he evaluates himself - and specifically, his gospel ministry. He ignores the judgments of others, andeven of his own conscience. 4He is interested in what God thinks of him. And he outlines the greatantidote to both the grandiose delusion that we arethe greatest, and the corrosive doubt that leads usto feel perpetually inadequate: in Christ we arejustified and accepted, and he accepts the work wedo according to the motives of our heart - notaccording to any human standards of achievement. Paul writes that God's judgment of our work is based on what we build on (the foundation that isChrist), and how we build (with care and goodquality). 5This should serve to reassure us greatly. We are accountable first of all to God and not thosearound us, and are judged not on the brilliance ofour clinical work but on the motives of our heart.God's resounding judgment is that we are acceptedin Christ, and he then graciously accepts our weakand faltering efforts to serve him based on ourdesire to be obedient - not on any outwardmeasures of success. He then goes on to show theabsurdity of boasting in our achievements anyway: after all, he asks, 'What do you have that you didnot receive?' 6For any of us who benefitted from a supportive family, a good education, good nutritionin childhood, political stability, good physical andmental health, positive role models, a good workethic and a keen mind, Paul continues, 'If you[received] it, why do you boast as if you did not?' Christians have an extraordinary gift that can be of particular relevance to those of us who work asregistrars: we are totally accepted by our lovingHeavenly Father, and don't need to seek humanrecognition or approval in order to validate ourworth. We shouldn't be puffed up with our ownimportance, but neither should we be downcast at our own limitations: we are God's children, and he has given us work to do! Carrying with us this stamp of divine approval, we are set free to serve God in many ways in ourwork. We can serve our patients, putting theirinterests first, rather than viewing them as a meansof enhancing our own reputation. We can serve ourjuniors, as we are less wrapped up in our owninsecurities, and more able to recognise their needsand support and encourage them. We can honourour seniors, as elsewhere in Scripture we are told to'obey [our] earthly masters... not only when theireye is on you and to curry favour, but with sincerityof heart and reverence for the Lord'. 7We can accept criticism, because we realise that our own personalreputation for being right all the time is notimportant. And we can challenge bad practice,because we have no pretentions that we are anybetter than anyone else. Indeed, as we gain areputation for being humble and genuine, people are much more likely to listen to what we say, as they realise we are not engaged in the kind ofpower games that others might play - we are inter-ested in them, and concerned for their wellbeing,and the good of patients and the wider hospital. Tim Keller, in his book The Freedom of Self- Forgetfulness, discusses what it means to be trulyhumble, particularly in the context of this same passage in 1 Corinthians. Humility isn't the false modesty of always telling others how bad we are. Rather, it is about paying much less attention toourselves, our reputation and our wants, andfocusing instead on God and others. 'It isn't so much about thinking less of yourself', he writes, 'as of thinking of yourself less.' 8 In a world obsessed by personal achievement, we can be different. We can stop worrying about ourselves all the time, and how we are perceived, and instead serve God and do the things he wantsus to do. What practical differences might this bring to the life of a registrar? We can admit when we don't know something, and so ensure that the patient gets the benefit of a second opinion, thus learning from otherswith more experience. We have opportunities to share the gospel withcolleagues, because we invest time asking colleagues about their lives. We form good relationships with everyone onthe team, holding the door open for awheelchair-pushing porter, wiping up spillages with the healthcare assistant, making a cup of tea for an over-worked staff nurse. As far as it depends on us, we don't get intofights with other specialties, because our ego issmall and we are willing to back down whereneeded. We can cope with the mistakes we inevitablymake, without becoming aggressive at criticismor broken by failure. Instead accepting personal responsibility, and also suggesting institutional changes that can minimise future errors. We are trusted by seniors, because we tell the truth rather than embellishing or covering-up to enhance our own reputation. We can set a positive culture within a team,challenging poor practice, bad attitude andcynicism by the quiet witness of generosity, and humble words of challenge where needed. Being a registrar will always be a challenge, but the less we think of ourselves, the more it can be a wonderful opportunity to serve others andshowcase God's goodness. Let's work day by day to shake off our egos and our insecurities, and enjoythe freedom of serving the Father in such an inter-esting and strategic role within the hospital.

Patients need to trust our clinical judgment and they won'tif we bracket it with our uncertainties. Asdoctors we are expected to lead by example. This means exuding an air of confidence and calm despite any panicrunning beneath the surface. From the earliest days of clinicalpractice we are taught to fake it. Take learning how to do lumbar punctures: somebody has to be your first. So you watch a few being done. You learn how to feel for the space, but ultimately, at some point, you need to insert theneedle. You talk the patient through the procedure, set up, bleep your senior to supervise ('just in case, an extra set of hands isalways helpful') and proceed. As the needle struggles to find thespace, you mutter reassurances to the patient, though it's really to yourself. All the time hiding the tremor in our voice and in our hands. The skill of projecting a better, calmer, more confident self does not stop with our patients. It permeates our home and church livestoo. Through social media it is easier than ever before to project the'best' part of one's character. We post pictures of holidays and tweetour successes. Rarely do we express the mundane, the everyday, or the hesitancies. Our online self is confident, fresh-faced, running marathons; not lounging on the sofa, tired, fed up. There are dangers and benefits to this behaviour. If we contin- ually project a 'sorted' self it inhibits honesty: honesty with ourselves and with other people. Without this we are unable toidentify areas of sin. So we may not seek forgiveness and help indefeating them. Openness with others encourages them to behonest with us. By acknowledging our own weaknesses it gives others the space to acknowledge theirs. We see this professionally: it is harder to askquestions and advice from a senior who seems completely sortedwhile juniors fear that they will think less of them if they ask aquestion. So they hide their uncertainties. This prevents juniorslearning and gaining confidence and it places patients at risk. Inchurch 'sorted leaders' inhibit growth in those around them andthey may feel inadequate or fear condemnation if they revealstruggles. The veneer of superficial control has benefits. In the same way that supported juniors learn to become seniors by stepping into therole before they feel fully ready, so as Christians we need to stepinto our identity as children of God before we have defeated all sinin our lives. The Bible is full of stories of ordinary men and womendoing extraordinary things despite lack of self-belief: consider Moses, Jonah, Esther and Peter. If we don't step out until we feel 100 percent confident we limit God and restrict his glory. Too much doubt and hesitation can undermine the assurance and confidence of those around us. We need to balance confidence and integrity, not falling into behaviours that falsely accentuate our conviction, or lack of it. Posturing to encourage others to confide in you is equally deceitful as portraying false self-assurance. As we think of these two projections of self - the one we emit to the world and the one within - we have to be careful not to 'split' ourselves. Initially it seems as if the scared, tired, grumpy, sinful self is the true version and as such we fear being exposed by thosearound us. As Christians, however, we know this to be false. We are more truly who God created us to be when we behave in ways that honour God. We are continually being sanctified by God and so themore worldly aspects of our character are in conflict with the more Christ-like. This conflict will continue until we join Christ in the new creation. John Stott puts it succinctly: 'My true self is what I am by creation, which Christ came to redeem, and by calling. My false self is what I am by the fall, which Christ came to destroy'. 1 The even greater truth is Christ died for the self I am by the fall. God sent his Son for the self I dislike; he loves that self for he sees the self he created. The challenge, therefore, is to not hide our fallen selves whilst striving to be our created selves. If we can walk this line of 'honestly faking it' we will find it easier to identify and battle sin in our own lives. It will empower the wider church family to grow, acknowledging that we are a church of sinners striving to be Christ's perfect ambassadors. Alice Gerth is an ACCS trainee in Anaesthetics. 1. .

These words, spoken by Cicely Saunders, led to the founding of StChristopher's Hospice 50 years ago. It is generally accepted that this was the beginning of the modern hospice and palliative care movement. Cicely had gone up to Oxford to read politics, philosophy and economics. The war started and she felt it was wrong to be studyingbooks when there was practical work to do. So, much to the displeasure of her parents and college principal, she left Oxford. Sheenrolled at St Thomas's Hospital and started her nursing trainingthere in 1940. She loved the work and felt that she had found hervocation. However, her long-standing back trouble worsened and she was told that she couldn't continue nursing. But she wanted toremain close to patients so she retrained as a medical social worker. In the summer of 1945, Cicely chose to go on holiday with a group of Christian friends. She had previously called herself anatheist but circumstances in the family and in her own life led her to seek a living faith. She had started reading, especially CS Lewis,and in the company of her friends, she came to accept she shouldcome to God 'just as I am'. She said later that 'God turned meround and it was all right. It was for all the world like suddenlyfinding the wind at your back instead of battling against it all thetime'. This was the experience which led Cicely to ask God to showher his purpose for her life. She waited two years for the answer when she met the young man who was to change her life. David Tasma was a Polish Jew who had escaped from the Warsaw ghetto and was working in London as a waiter. All hisfamily had perished in the Holocaust. Cicely became his only friendand they talked a great deal about his needs which were not beingmet. His physical pain was poorly controlled with intermittentinjections of analgesics. He was desperately lonely and dying afterwhat he felt was a useless and unfulfilled life. He had been broughtup a Jew but no longer knew if he believed in God. Cicely later described the total pain experienced by the dying consisting of 'physical, emotional, social and spiritual pain'. Shelearnt this at David's bedside. It was as they talked that there cameto them both a vision of a better way to care for the Davids of thefuture. And when he died, he left Cicely all the money he had,\u00a3500, with the words 'I will be a window in your home'. During the next two years, Cicely sought to test her vocation by spending time with dying patients, but this did not satisfy her. Shediscussed her calling with the surgeon she worked for. 'Go and readmedicine', he said. 'It is the doctors who desert the dying'. Cicely was by now 33 and had not studied science at school but she was accepted at St Thomas's for 1st MB. I joined her for the clinical course in 1954 and we came to know each other well as we were members of the hospital ChristianUnion. Remarkably, no fewer than five of us became hospice doctors at a time when there were almost no hospice doctors in the world. After qualifying and house jobs, Cicely knew that she needed to understand more about pain control in the terminally ill. So sheobtained a scholarship to do research in this field and worked with the patients at St Joseph's Hospice. Her work showed that, withregular giving of analgesics, the widespread fear of addiction wasunfounded. On 24 June 1959, Cicely was reading Daily Light, a collection of Bible texts. That day she read: 'Commit thy way unto the Lord andhe shall bring it to pass'. She knew with complete certainty that thiswas the time to do something practical about the vision that hadmotivated her for eleven years. She gathered around her a group of people who advised her, raised funds and prayed. In 1961 she launched the charity and started looking for a site. This was found in Sydenham, the money came in and the hospice with 54 beds was opened by Princess Alexandra on 24 July 1967. David's window was in a prominent place. During these 50 years there has been an enormous increase in interest around end of life care. When I joined Cicely in 1968, she gave me a double-sided sheet of A4 saying that this was the symptom control I needed to know! This has grown into the Oxford Textbook of Palliative Medicine and much more. A great deal of research has been undertaken including comparing analgesics, studying clinical and psychosocial problems and service delivery. The movement has spread worldwide. There are now 200 hospices in this country and 16,000 units worldwide, including many in poorer countries. Most people in this country will, by now, have some acquaintance with hospice and palliative care. Unfortunately, few seem to know the story behind them and that they came about because of thecalling of God to an individual, Cicely Saunders.

Talking about dying Help in facing death & dying Philip Giddings, Martin Down, Elaine Sugden, Gareth Tuckwell Sex and politics havebecome mainstream,but death remains as the last subject which we do nottalk about. That, according to theauthors, 'simply will not do'. In reality, many people faced withlife-limiting illnesses do want to talk, but are either afraid to or just do not know how to broachthe subject. This pithy little volume is an attempt to helpbreak down some of thosebarriers. Written from an unashamedly pastoral Christian perspective, Talking about dying is a helpful starter. It addresses a wide rangeof issues, from planning funeralsand other arrangements, to starting conversation about your own death or someone else's. It also looks at miscarriage and still birth, sudden death, suicide andtalking to children. It evenmanages to explain the gospel succinctly in a chapter on whatcomes after death. Each chapter is short, with practical follow up reading and resources. Very much aimed at the concerned layperson, this book could be a useful tool fortraining church or chaplaincypastoral visitors.

It's the fruit of acareer-long commitment of adoctor who lived and worked inseveral Muslim countries, thenpractised in a mostly-MuslimEnglish inner-city context. The author's thesis is that faith sharing needs to start at gut and heart level - 'anthropology, nottheological disputation'. Much of the book is an endeavour to find 'a common language'. Even so he does not duck hard questions, such as questions over Islam's inherently violent nature. It is full of treasure: insights about the cultural and linguisticgaps standing and accept hospi- tality and make friends. summer 2017 triple helix 21This week I sat by the bedside of a morbidlyobese woman from my congregation. She confessedthat her weight was the result ofoverindulgence. And now herheart was failing. With ourmeeting still swimming round inmy head, I returned home tohear one of my daughters strug- gling with being called 'fat' byclassmates. She is not remotelyoverweight. In different ways,both cases reveal something ofthe cultural pressure andpersonal sin that creates issuesaround our bodies. What does a Christian response look like? Paula Gooder writes that the relative Christian silence on thissubject, coupled with aprevailing platonic dualism inour culture, has led to a distortedview of the body. But do not befooled, this analysis managed, byturns, to make my heart sing, myhead ache and my thinking shift.It drew me to revisit Bible texts I thought I knew, to ask hardquestions about what I mean by words like 'soul' and managed toanchor it all in the practicalities of cremation, disability, contentment, praise, life after death and more. Sweetly pastoral, concretely practical, challengingly philo-sophical, helpfully personal. Gooder navigates the subject deftly - encouragingly clear where the Bible is, and rightlyambiguous where the Bible isless definitive. It left me more thankful for the body that God has given me, more eager for the return of Christ and asking questions like: 'from Paul'sperspective, how beautiful am I?'Perhaps Gooder could have, in one or two places, tempered her celebration of our bodies with a theology of the cross. Is a pampering at the local spa or enjoying well cooked meals withfriends always spiritual? But Gooder merely wants to start a conversation - and this book does that magnificently.Elizabeth McNaughtexplores the challengesof living with anorexia from a deeply personal perspective. As both a doctor and a sufferer she brings a balanced and insightful perspective to this difficult subject. She explores the complex underlying causes and the conse-quences of eating disorders on both patients and their families. She identifies current issues with our mental health care system in a non-judgmental manner. By walking us through her ownexperience the reader is helped to empathise with Elizabeth's suffering. She does not hide the hurt her actions caused othersbut helps you to understand why she behaved in the manner shedid. The book ends with two short essays by her parents.These will be particularly helpful for families supporting children with mental illness. It has enough detail to interest those of a medical background without alienating a non-medical reader.

Few would disagree that our prisons are a festering problem. A Guardian 'Long Read' has drawn attention to an issue that largely goes unnoticed, though CMF members serving as prison doctors are well aware of them. The demographics of the prison population are alarming. In 15 years, the number of prisoners aged over 60 has tripled; numbers of octogenarians almost doubled in the last two years. Our prisons, many of them built more than a century ago are not fitted to their needs. Guardian 19 June 2017 bit.ly/2to0hRh Game mocks psychiatric illness?

BBC 14 June 2017 bbc.in/2sOzCQG Two kinds of liberalism Tim Farron's resignation as leader of the Liberal Democrat Partyrightly invites heart-searching. He styled himself as a 'liberal to my fingertips' but found himself ensnared between rival versionsof liberalism. For Farron it was 'about defending the rights andliberties of people who believe different things to me'. He lost outto a nastier, politically correct version with no space for differ-ences in thought. Over the last decades this rancid form of liber-alism has gained control of what Bill Bright many years ago called'the mountains of culture'. Nick Spencer, Tim Farron and the two kinds of liberalism.

Digital Health 27 May 2017 bit.ly/2s2fYfjA veggie tale A five-a-day habit is recognised as a gateway to good health. But how do parents coax children and young people to buy into the proposition that it's very good for you and - even more importantly - do something about it? Terms such as 'wholesome' lack appeal and sound boring. Now a team at Stanford University may have hit on a solution. They tried a new approach in the university cafeteria.Veggie sales went up by 25% when indulgent labels were used, like 'sizzling beans' or 'dynamite beets'.

There are also doubts about its effectiveness as an'insurance' against inability to conceive by natural means. 'Not what it's cracked up to be', said the Daily Telegraph. Certainly egg freezing is surrounded by much PR spin.

It lists several health complaints which it traces to over-indulgence: dry eyes,especially if you are a contact lens user; short-sightedness;reduction of sleep quality, particularly among those who watchimmediately prior to going to bed.

Too muchtime in front of the TV is correlated with diabetes and heart disease, and according to AsapSCIENCE, shortened lives.

Galatians 4:6 (New King James Version) Who do you think you are? The question can be a challenge, a put down, or an invitationinto life transforming truth. It is a crucialquestion for us to answer, for what we believe about ourselves will influence how we behave. 1As a doctor, medical leader, husband, father, colleague, preacher, I have manyroles and expectations upon me. But which of these define me?What is the order of priority? What does 'success' or 'failure' inthese realms look like? If I ascribe my primary identity to any particular role, I risk confusion over my true priorities. I also become vulnerable toassaults on my spiritual integrity by failure or success in these areas.My sense of worth can become hostage to how I perform. Fordoctors this is a particular danger: we work in a highly-respectedprofession; we carry life and death responsibility; the rewards forhigh performers can be lucrative; we are often under enormouspressure; and our work can easily become all-consuming. As Christians we may 'justify' the latter by the call to lay down our lives for others, which our profession gives ample opportunity to do. Yet the life-transforming truth is that we are sons and daughters of the Father. 2We are dearly loved, fully accepted, outrageously forgiven, extravagantly blessed and eternally secure. Therein lies our identity. Because we are in Christ, God speaks over each of us, 'This is my beloved son/daughter, in whom I am well pleased'.3 I am a child of God. That is what defines me, sets my perspective, and orders my priorities. It is a truth that our enemy will challengeat every opportunity, as he did to Jesus immediately after those words were spoken over him. 4I must hold fast to what God says about me, rather than be led down a path of identity crisis that can be destructive to me and to others.
