Still ENJOY them. The holidays b ring many joys and challenges. Arming yourself with knowledge and some great recipes can help keep you well. Updating cla ssic recipes can seem daunting but there are a few rules that can result in enjoyable versions that won't greatly alter the outcome. 1. Reduce sugar content by 25% straight from a recipe , or at least by a few tablespoons! 2. Replace refined white sugar (sucrose ) with natural, unrefined sugar cane (Sucanat) 3. Replace all -purpose flour with whole wheat pastry flour for a little more fiber, protein, and minerals (one to one ratios, no need to change anything else) 4. Replace refined corn syrups with brown rice syrup or honey or maple syrup 5. Replace honey or sugar in smoothies or drinks with a few drops of no -calorie, no sugar stevia liquid (it's from an herb, not an artificial sweetener) , avoid artificial sweeteners. 6. Don't use shortening in a recipe. Instead, replace the full amount with coconut oil or butter for similar outcome but without the harmful , inflammatory fats from shortening . 7. Relax. Indulging in a treat here or there isn't bad for you, make sure you enjoy every bite!

Monk Fruit sweetener comes from a gourd and is low calorie and diabetic friendly. However, most brands on the market are mixed with erythritol so that it can be easily substituted for sugar in recipes. Erythritol, like xylitol, is a sugar alcohol that is low -calorie and digested differently that sucrose sugars. However, some people do get bloated if they don't digest well due to intestinal inflammation or recent surgeries so eat a little bit first to determine if you respond well to it or not. 2 cups almond flour (can use almond meal for a more crumbly result) 1/2 cup monk fruit sweetener (or sub xylitol or unrefined natural sugar) 1 1/2 teaspoons baking power 1/2 teaspoon sea salt 2 teaspoons allspice 1 teaspoon cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice 1/2 teaspoon cloves or nutmeg 2 large eggs (or use 2 tablespoons chia seeds blended wit h \u00bc cup water until gelled) 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce or pumpkin puree 1/3 cup coconut milk (natural full -fat from a can) 1 teaspoon vanilla extract \u00bd teaspoon almond extract (optional to leave out if you don't have any on hand) Optional: \u00bd cup chopped walnuts, 1/3 cup raisins, \u00bd cup dark chocolate chips Preheat oven to 365F.
