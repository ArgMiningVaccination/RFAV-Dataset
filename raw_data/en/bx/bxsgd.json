This can be defined in a variety of ways, in a broad sense though it refers to the subtle energies that circulate throughout our bodies. Based on the behaviors we engage in, we either enhance life force or diminish life force potential. It is fascinating to consider the less dense matter our body retains, the more room allowed for these energies to flow. Our bodies are comprised of a series of tubes, veins, arteries, and elimination channels. If our internal piping system becomes clogged, oxygen transportation becomes stagnant and life force energy is lost. I subscribe to the dietary philosophies that are deeply rooted in nature's inherent intelligence. This includes organic living foods, superfoods, spring water, naturally derived supplements, and tonic herbs. In order to enhance life force via diet, it makes good sense to consume substances that contain life force already. In order to further dial in this concept for our unique individuality, it benefits us to understand the life force principles that run the human body. Consider this excerpt from my book [The Life Food Peak Performance System](http://www.ronnie-landis.com/book/) as an introduction into the ancient Chinese approach to life force physiology: \"The concept of life force energy has been discussed all throughout history. As a student of the Chinese herbal approach, I have grown to understand the different views on healing based on the philosophy of the great masters. In the Chinese understanding of the life force principles, they drew heavily on a concept known as the Three Treasures. According to the Taoist teachings these treasures consisted of compassion, frugality, and humility. The traditional Chinese medical teachings consist of Qi, Jing, and Shen, all of which philosophically parallel each other. These treasures govern our overall vital life force, determining how we experience life in direct proportion to the thoughts we think, the food we eat, and the activities we participate in. The western methods of identifying illness is packaged as scientifically advanced, yet in comparison, it is very much in the embryonic stage of maturity. The ways in which an allopathic doctor might approximate a diagnoses is through standard blood testing. According to many masters of Chinese herbology, this method is extremely limited since blood testing has no way of determining the root of their condition being an energetic imbalance. The physical ailment is a symptom of a deeper problem. For example, the western approach to healing and nutrition may focus entirely on one organ such as the liver, and the immediate response is to focus solely on the liver. In Chinese medicine, the focus is directing the energy through not only that specific area of the body, but allowing the related organ systems to work in unison for the whole. This is not to imply one is better than the other, it is to show the difference in approaches so that we can create a broader view in our understanding of what we consider to be the fundamental life "}
