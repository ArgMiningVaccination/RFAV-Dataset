The unpasteurized kimchi or sauerkraut gives it added benefits, as these fermented foods are full of enzymes and the fermented cabbage aids in [intestinal health](/video/becky-natrajan-gastro-intestinal-health). (Especially essential if you have taken antibiotics!) This recipe is what my friend calls a soup-salad. It is raw veggies in a bowl with a warming broth poured over top, this creates a super quick to make, crunchy, vibrant, nearly [raw](/video/cooked-vs-raw-food) soup. Time: 20 minutes Serves 2 Ingredients - 1 Liter stock or water (you can use homemade chicken, beef, mushroom or vegetable stock, but even water is fine.) - 1 teaspoon minced or grated ginger - 1 clove garlic, minced, pressed or grated - 1/2 Thai chili, chopped finely (or more, or none) - 3-4 leaves of [kale](/article/kale-avocado-salad-kick-recipe) - 2 carrots, made into ribbons or 'noodles' with a vegetable peeler. Daikon is a good substitute or addition to this, also peeled like the carrots. - 1/4 cup Miso (I use genmai or brown miso) - 1/4 cup, or your preference of unpasteurized sauerkraut or kimchi (or Sea 'Chi) Optional (more filling) Noodles: I like the thicker pad Thai rice noodles, or super-fine rice vermicelli. Get the brown rice variety if you can. Directions: - In a medium pot, bring stock or water to a boil. - Add the garlic, ginger and chili to the liquid. Add noodles and cook until almost done. For rice noodles, this can be 1 minute or so. Once noodles are nearly done, take the pot off of the heat. - Meanwhile, make a paste with miso in a bowl and some water to thin it out. It should be the consistency of peanut butter. (This makes it easier to incorporate into the soup than adding the miso directly.) - Whisk in miso. - Prepare bowls with shredded raw vegetables in the bottom. Pour soup over veggies. - Now add a generous amount of unpasteurized sauerkraut or kimchi. Garnish with green onions or cilantro if you like. Variations: Use this basic broth as a base for other broth soups- like add frozen wontons, homemade raviolis, seaweed or quickly cook broccoli for a hearty broccoli broth soup.
