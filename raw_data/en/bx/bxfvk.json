Purpose & Background Following implementation of our mandatory vaccination policy as well as verification of the vaccination status of our campus community, the College is transitioning COVID -19 protocols to reflect a fully vaccinated population as of July 2 9, 2021.1 Per the Centers for Disease Control (\"CDC\"), people who are fully vaccinated are at low risk of symptomatic or severe infection and it appears that people who are fully vaccinated are also less likely to have asymptomatic infection and to transmit the COVID- 19 virus. This policy and associated protocols are based largely on the San Francisco Department of Public Health, the Center for Disease Control's (\"CDC\") Interim Public Health Recommendations for Fully Vaccinated People , the CAL/OSHA COVID -19 Prevention Emergency Temporary Standards , and limited recommendations from the State of California Department of Public Health . Fully Vaccinated Individual: Pursuant to Section 3205(b)(9) of CAL- OSHA COVID -19 Prevention Emergency Temporary Standards, an individual is considered \"fully vaccinated\" if the individual can provide documentation that the individual has received, at least 14 days prior, either the second dose in a two -dose COVID -19 vaccine series or a single -dose COVID -19 vaccine. Vaccines must be FDA approved; have an emergency use authorization from the FDA; or, for persons fully vaccinated outside of the United States, be listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization. Individuals who have only received one dose of a two -dose COVID -19 vaccine series or who have not received any COVID -19 vaccine, are considered \"unv accinated.\" II. Campus Access With verification of compliance with the mandatory vaccination policy , the College is reopening the UC Hastings Law campus to full capacity on July 2 9, 2021, with limited exceptions. Faculty, staff, students, contract personnel, vendors, and others in our campus community who are vaccinated have no further constraints on access to campus buildings. Unvaccinated individuals who have received authorization to be on campus must comply with precautions outlined in Section IV below. Visitors are also welcome on campus for 1 The mandatory vaccination policy does allow for exemptions in limited instances. However, individuals with an approved exemption or accommodation will be required to take precautions while on campus as generally described elsewhere in this policy and as specified in the accommodation process . 2 meetings, events, and use of the Law Caf\u00e9 though certain spaces, as outlined below, r emain off-limits to visitors at this time. This access is subject to any changes necessitated by California or San Francisco Departments of Public Health. Details on specific activities and locations follow. Academic Classes and Programs : Will resume in -person with the start of the fall semester. Campus Events : Will resume in -person without specific authorization or advance approval outside of the normal events reservation processes outlined in the College's Space Reservation policy on August 2, 2021. Library : The library will reopen for communal studying , while continuing to provide study room spaces, for the internal population in the fall semester . General public and visitors remain prohibited at this time to ensure available space for our internal campus community as we have increased the number of virtual classes, which necessitates availability of quiet space for students to take virtually while on campus . It is anticipated that the library will provide visitor access to pre -approved unaffiliated l ibrary patrons in spring of 2022. The general public and visitors should consult the library's website for more information on services. Fitness Cente r: The fitness center is permitted to resume operations at normal capacity; however, it is available only to our internal campus community including faculty, staff, students, and recent graduates studying for the Bar. It is not available to public visitors. Basketball Gym: The basketball gym is permitted to operate at normal cap acity. It is available to our internal campus community including faculty, staff, students, recent graduates studying for the Bar , and other individuals with UC Hastings ID badges that grant access to campus buildings . It is not yet available to public vis itors. Law Caf\u00e9 & Dining Commons : The Law Caf\u00e9 will resume operations for the fall semester and is open to all in our internal community as well as visitors from the external community. III. Determination of COVID -19 Vaccin ation Status UC Hastings Law is veri fying COVID -19 vaccin ation status of all faculty, staff, students, and contract employees per the College's mandatory vaccination policy . There are different modalities that we are utilizing to assess vaccine status contingent upon your role at the institution. Students: Students are required to upload their COVID- 19 vaccination information to Health Pass, which is HIPAA and FERPA compliant, through Carbon Health's online app or receive formal notice from the College that their request for an exemption or an accommodation has been approved. Information about that process is available here . Employees & Contract Personnel : Employees and contract personnel are required to upload their COVID- 19 vaccination information to Sentry MD, our HIPAA compliant vaccine verification provider, via a specific Sentry MD link that was sent to all 3 employees and contract personnel via email. If you have questions about this process , have a unique situation, or cannot locate your Sentry MD link, please contact humanresources@uchastings.edu . Visitors: Visitors to the campus are required to attest to their vaccination status and provide COVID -19 documentation if requested prior to entry utilizing a COVID- 19 screening questionnaire. All visitors who are not vaccinated are required to comply with Section IV below . IV. Required Precautions for Unvaccinated Individuals There is a small number of unvaccinated i ndividuals who have received authorization to be on campus in accordance with the College's mandator y vaccination policy . These individuals must undertake additional precautions in order to protect themselves and the broader community from increased COVID -19 transmission risk ; the College will identify these precautions through an interactive process with each individual and communicate directly with each individual. This part sets forth the minimum standard, which requires that unvaccinated individuals wear a face covering while on campus in order to mitigate any potential exposure or transmission either to themselves or others. Unvaccinated individuals will also be required to get tested for COVID- 19 on a regular basis at the College's expense. Unvaccinated individuals are not generally required to physically distance , though may be required to do so based upon individual circumstances. Additional precautions may be required based upon individual circumstances as well as developing public health guidance and practices . Unvaccinated individuals who are authorized to be on campus are not required to wear a face covering in the following instances: o When they are alone in a room that is not used by anyone else with a buffer of at least one hour between other potential uses of that room . o When an unvaccinated individual is eating or drinking , provided they are physically distanced, at least six feet from all other individuals and, if indoors, outside air supply has been maximized to the extent feasible. Face coverings are available to all unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals alike upon request. UC Hastings reserves the right to revise or withdraw accommodations from the COVID- 19 vaccine requirement, following an interactive process with each individual affected, based on developing public health guidance and emerg ing risks at the College. V. Physical Distancing at UC Hastings Law Campus Per the CDC, fully vaccinated individuals may resume activities without physical distancing except where required by federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial laws, rules, and regulations, including local business and workplace guidance. At UC Hastings Law, given our mandatory vaccine policy, we are eliminating the requirement for physical distancing within 4 our campus buildings with limited exceptions as detailed below and in Section IV . This means that facilities and spaces may return to normal occupancy , and classes, events, programs, and other campus activities may utilize standard capacit ies based upon existing room capacities. Continued physical distancing is recommended, where possible, for individuals with weakened immune systems. Unvaccinated individuals who are permitted on campus will not be required to physically distance, as they will wear face coverings as a mitigating requirement, except as detailed below. However, the College will assess each approved vaccination accommodation individually to determine what specific precautions are necessary based upon individual circumstances. Physical distancing requirements of six-feet of distance still apply : o During outbreaks as described further below. o When an unvaccinated individual is eating or drinking. See Section IV above for more details. The College retains the right to re -implement physical distancing requirements either when required by public health agencies or when deemed necessary given specific circumstances. VI. Face Coverings at UC Hastings Law Given the evolving situation with increasing case rates and hospitalizations and the impact of the Delta Variant , as well as breakthrough infections , UC Hastings Law will, for the time being, retain the face covering requirement for all individuals while moving about the campus indoors and when interacting with students, visitors, and me mbers of the public, irrespective of vaccination status. Individuals are not required to wear masks when alone in individual offices . We will continue to closely monitor metrics related to COVID -19 transmission and revise this policy to permit vaccinated individuals to forego face coverings entirely as soon as it is deem ed safe to do so . UC Hastings Law has face coverings available to all in our community upon request. UC Hastings law will communicate all face covering requirements to any individuals visiting the campus via signage at building entries. VII. COVID -19 Symptoms & Confirmed Cases Students, faculty, staff, and all members of the campus community are encouraged to assess themselves for symptoms of infectious illnesses, including COVID -19, prior to coming to campus each day. If you are experiencing symptoms of illness, you must stay home and should seek medical care if indicated by your symptoms . If you are on campus and begin to experience symptoms of illness, you must go home if you are able, or seek medical care, dependent upon your symptoms and circumstances with information provided below to assist in this determination. 5 Symptoms of COVID -19: Individuals with the following symptoms, may have CO VID- 19: o Fever or chills o Cough o Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing o Fatigue o Muscle or body aches o Headache o New loss of taste or smell o Sore throat o Congestion or runny nose o Nausea or vomiting o Diarrhea Life Threatening Symptoms of COVID -19: If you have any of the following symptoms, you may need urgent medical care. Please call 911 or go to the nearest emergency department. If you see someone else suffering from these symptoms, please assist the person in obtaining appropriate medical care. o Pale, gray, or blue -colored skin, lips, or nail beds depending on skin tone o Severe and constant pain or pressure in the chest o Difficulty breathing (such as gasping for air, being unable to walk or talk without catching your breath, severe wheezing, nostrils flaring, grunting, or ribs or stomach moving in and out deeply and rapidly o New disorientation (acting confused) o Unconscious or very difficult to wake up o Slurred speech or difficulty speaking (new or worsening) o New or worsening seizures o Signs of low blood pressure (too weak to stand, dizziness, lightheaded, feeling cold, pale, clammy skin) Determining when to Seek Medical Care or take a COVID- 19 Test : The CDC provides a very helpful COVID -19 self -checker for use in determining when to seek COVID- 19 testing or medical care based upon your individual circumstances and symptoms if any. If you are confirmed with COVID- 19, you are required to alert UC Hastings Law as soon as you are physically able to do so. You should follow instructions of your medical care provider. Timeline for Returning to Campus following COVID- 19 Illness : Per the CDC, the timeline for returning to campus is contingent upon whether you were symptomatic, asymptomatic, or have a weakened immunocompromised immune system. o Symptomatic Case : A symptomatic confirmed case can return to campus when the following three conditions are met: (1) 10 days since symptoms 6 first appeared and (2) 24 hours with no fever without the use of fever - reducing medications and (3) other symptoms of COVID -19 are improving.2 o Asymptomatic Case : If you continue to have no symptoms, you can return to campus 10 days after your positive test for COVID- 19. o Severe COVID -19 Illness or Weakened/ Immunocompromised Individual: People who are severely ill with COVID -19 may need to stay home up to 20 days after symptoms first appeared. Immunocompromised individuals may require testing to return to campus or otherwise be around other peopl e. Your healthcare provider is the best source for this information and will let you know when you can return to campus. Most people do not require additional testing to determine when to return to campus ; however, if recommended by your healthcare provide r, they will let you know when you can return to campus and resume other activities, which would supersede timelines listed above unless the timeline provided by the healthcare provider is shorter than those listed above. If you are an employee who is confirmed with COVID -19, your return to work timeline follows the timelines set forth above. However, please refer to IX (10) below for more information o n special circumstances for returning to the workplace . VIII. Close Contacts A close contact is defined by the CDC as someone who was within 6 feet of someone confirmed as infected by a laboratory test for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a 24- hour period (e.g., three individual five -minute exposures within a day would equate to a qualifying exposure). 3 If you are unvaccinated and you have been in close contact with someone who has COVID -19, you are not permitted to come to campus and should take the following steps: o Stay home for 14 days after your last contact with the person who has COVID -19 or until 7 days after the close contact if you receive a negative test result from a test taken at l east 5 days after exposure. o Watch for symptoms of COVID- 19 (see above) and immediately self -isolat e and contact your local public health authority or healthcare provider. o Stay away from others, especially people who are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID -19. If you are fully vaccinated and have been in close contact with someone who has COVID -19, but you are not experiencing symptoms, you are not required to stay 2 Note, loss of taste and smell may persist for weeks or months after recovery and need not solely delay a return to campus. 3 A close contact also includes providing care to someone who has COVID- 19; having direct p hysical contact with someone with COVID -19 (i.e., hugging or kissing them); sharing drinking or eating utensils with someone with COVID -19; or having someone with COVID- 19 sneezing, coughing, or otherwise getting respiratory droplets on you. 7 home, however, you should continue to monitor for symptoms for 14 days after your last contact with the person who had COVID- 19. IX. COVID -19 Prevention Plan In addition to the College's mandatory vaccination requirement, and in compliance with the CAL-OSHA COVID -19 Prevention Emergency Temporary Standards, UC Hastings Law continues to implement a COVID- 19 Prevention Program as outlined below. 1. System for Communicating : UC Hastings Law has methods in place to exchange information with the community regarding COVID- 19. This includes via regular email communications, emergency mass notifications if applicable, the UC Hastings website, COVID- 19 My Hastings page, campus signage, and via direct communication with COVID -19 pandemic response team members including the Chief Operating Officer, Chief Human Resources Officer, and Dean of Students. a. All community me mbers are required to report COVID -19 symptoms , as well as possible close contacts and potential hazards at the campus, and may do so without fear of reprisal. b. UC Hastings Law communicates COVID- 19 policies and procedures and other relevant information to the community, and in some circumstances, to other persons (e.g., contract personnel, vendors, etc.) within the campus. 2. Identification and Evaluation of COVID- 19 Hazards : UC Hastings Law is assessing the campus for COVID -19 hazards regularly. UC Hastings Law employees or their representatives are allowed to participate in hazard identification and evaluation. This includes processes for symptom screening, exposure -response, contact tracing, improving indoor air quality, periodic inspections, evaluating CO VID-19 prevention protocols, and reviewing state and local orders/guidance related to COVID -19. Notably, employers are required to treat all persons as potentially infectious, regardless of symptoms or negative test results. a. For improving indoor air quality , CAL -OSHA requires employers to evaluate how to maximize ventilation with outdoor air to the highest level of filtration efficiency compatible with the existing ventilation system and to assess whether or not the use of portable or mounted HEPA filtrati on units or other air cleaning systems would reduce the risk of COVID -19 transmission. i. Pursuant to San Francisco Department of Public Health ventilation guidance for improving ventilation in indoor spaces, the College has taken the following actions in 200 McAllister and 333 Golden Gate , as these buildings have HVAC systems. 1. Disabled demand controls on HVAC ventilation systems so fans operate continuously, regardless of heating/cooling needs. 2. Opened outdoor air dampers and closed recirculation dampers to reduce or eliminate air recirculation. 8 3. Generated clean -to-less- clean air movement by adjusting the settings of supply and exhaust air diffusers and/or dampers in higher risk areas, so that potentially contaminated air is moved away from occupants. 4. Improved central air filtration by upgrading to MERV 10 rated filters. 5. Created a plan for inspecting, and when necessary, cleaning or replacing filters, which includes changing filters at least quarterly, inspecting filter housings and racks to ensure appropriat e filter fit, checked for ways to minimize filter bypass, and running fans continuously. 6. Programmed HVAC cycles to bring in maximum outside air flow for 1 -2 hours before the buildings open each day. ii. Pursuant to San Francisco Department of Public Health ventilation guidance for improving ventilation in indoor spaces, the College has taken the following actions in 100 McAllister , as this building does not have an HVAC system and instead relies upon pass ive ventilation. 1. Encourage d all occupants, as weather conditions allow, to increase fresh outdoor air by opening windows and doors. 2. Encourage d all occupants to use fans to increase the effectiveness of open windows, by positioning fans securely and caref ully in or near windows and to minimize air blowing from person to person. 3. Provided Portable Air Filters to office occupants and in spaces potentially utilized by groups of people including the fitness center, Clara Foltz Lounge, and Skyroom. 3. Investigate and Respond to COVID- 19 Cases : UC Hastings Law will conduct an investigation every time there is a COVID -19 case on the campus, which includes verifying case status and determining close contacts, receiving symptom and test result information, and identifying and recording cases. Steps of the investigations are documented, and changes are made to improve the health and safety of the campus. a. Within one business day that UC Hastings Law knows of a COVID -19 case present at the campus, UC Hastings Law will giv e written notice to all employees known to have been present at the worksite , as defined by CAL- OSHA, during the high- risk exposure period.4 If an employee is represented, written notice will also be provided to the employee's authorized representative. And, written notice will be provided to any independent 4 High -risk exposure period for symptomatic individuals is from two days before symptoms first developed until ten days after symptoms first appeared, and 24 hours have passed with no fever, without the use of fever -reducing medications, and symptoms have i mproved. High -risk exposure period for asymptomatic individuals is from two day before until ten days after the collection of their first positive test. 9 contractors, employers, or contract employees known to have been present. In such a situation, a ll personal identifying information of COVID -19 cases or persons with symptoms, will be kept confidential except when reported to public agencies or as otherwise required by law. b. In a non- outbreak situation, UC Hastings Law will offer free testing during paid time to employees who had a close contact in the workplace and to any employees that develop COVID -19 symptoms after the close contact occurs 5 except for the following categories of employees: i. Individuals who were fully vaccinated before the close contact and do not develop symptoms; ii. Symptomatic COVID -19 cases who returned to work and have remained free of symptoms for 90 days after the initial onset of symptoms; and iii. Asymptomatic COVID -19 cases who returned to work and who remained free of symptoms for 90 days after the first positive test. 4. Correction of COVID -19 Hazards : UC Hastings Law will implement p olicies and procedures to correct unsafe and unhealthy conditions, work practices, and procedures related to COVID -19 in a timely manner based upon the severity of the hazard. 5. Training and Instructions : UC Hastings Law will provide training and instructio n to the community on various topics, including , for example, COVID -19 transmission, symptoms, prevention, access to testing and vaccination, employment related benefits, and use/availability of face coverings. 6. Use of Face Coverings : See Section V I above. 7. Other Administrative Controls, Administrative Controls, and PPE : UC Hastings Law has implemented control measures to minimize exposure to COVID- 19 hazards. These measures include: a. Improving indoor air quality (see IX (2)(a) above). b. Increased cleaning, following a COVID -19 case, of frequently touched surfaces c. Encouraging handwashing and providing hand sanitizer d. Evaluating employee's needs for personal protective equipment such as gloves, goggles, and face shields, and providing that PPE as need ed 8. Reporting, Record -Keeping, & Access : UC Hastings Law reports information about COVID -19 cases and outbreaks at the workplace to local health departments when 5 If an employee gets tested outside of their working hours, then they will be paid for their reasonabl e time to get tested, as well as reasonable travel costs to and from the testing site. Testing sites do not need to be on campus so long as employees do not incur costs for testing. 10 required by law. UC Hastings Law also maintains records of steps taken to implement the COVID- 19 Prevention Plan and keeps a record of all COVID -19 cases at the campus, including specified information about employees and their presence at the worksite. 9. Exclusion of COVID -19 Cases & Individuals with a Close Contact: See Section VI II above. Additio nally, and specifically for employees who are excluded from work due to COVID -19 or due to a close contact with an individual with COVID- 19, UC Hastings Law will maintain the employee's earnings, wages, seniority, and all other employee rights and benefits as if the employee has not been removed from their job. Employees will be required to exhaust accrued leave during absences . 10. Return to Work Criteria: For employees confirmed with COVID -19, the same criteria for determining a return to campus as those ou tlined in Section IV above . Though the following scenarios are unlikely, they are included here for potential use in the event of exigent circumstances. a. In the event of critical staffing shortages based on actual COVID -19 cases or exposures, health care, emergency response, and certain social service workers who do not develop symptoms may return after Day 7 from the date of the last exposure if they received a negative PCR test result from a specimen collected after Day 5. A critical staffing shortage cannot be based upon anticipation of a future outbreak. b. UC Hastings Law may also request a waiver of the requirement to exclude from the workplace exposed or COVID- 19 positive employees or personnel, when the exclusion would create an undue risk to public health and safety. Such waiver request must be submitted to rs@dir.ca.gov . If granted, the campus must implement measures to prevent workplace transmission. X. Surveillance Testing Surveillance testing is the practice of regularly or intermittently screening individuals for COVID -19 in order to detect an outbreak early. Per San Francisco Department of Public Health guidance, surveillance testing is not currently recommended because o f the low rates of transmission in San Francisco and the greater Bay Area. Due to potential for false positives, conducting surveillance testing during rates of low transmission is likely to mandate quarantines, isolation, and other measures that are not w arranted given current community spread. However, per CAL -OSHA requirements for unvaccinated employees, and by inference the likely relevant applicability to students, UC Hastings Law is requiring weekly testing of unvaccinated employees and students, with an approved vaccine accommodation . UC Hastings Law looks to San Francisco Department of Public Health for guidance on if and when surveillance testing is required or recommended as an appropriate measure given community spread. 11 XI. Requirements for a Minor COVID -19 Outbreak A minor COVID outbreak is defined by CAL -OSHA as three or more employee COVID -19 cases within an exposed group6 within a 14 -day period as measured by the testing date of each case. These requirements apply until there are no new COVID- 19 cases in the exposed group for 14 days. UC Hastings Law will work with San Francisco Department of Public Health to ensure appropriate requirements are followed. 1. COVID -19 Testing : Provided to unvaccinated individuals, free of charge, for the first two weeks of the outbreak. Additional testing may be recommended or required by Public Health. 2. Respirators : Employees have a right to request a respirator if they are unvaccinated. 3. Physical Distancing or Partitions : UC Hastings Law will determine whether to implement physical distancing of at least six feet, or if not feasible, the use of physical partitions. 4. Outbreak Investigation and Hazard Corrections : UC Hastings Law will immediately investigate and determine potential factors that contributed to the outbr eak, make any necessary changes to reduce potential for transmission, and document all of these efforts. 5. Ventilation : UC Hastings Law will use the highest compatible filtering efficiency for mechanically ventilated buildings and determine whether portable or mounted HEPA filtration units or other air cleaning systems would further reduce transmission and implement to the degree feasible. XII. Requirements for Major COVID -19 Outbreaks A major COVID -19 outbreak is defined by CAL- OSHA as 20 or more employee COVID- 19 cases in an exposed group within a 30 -day period. The 30 -day period is measured based on the testing date of each case. These requirements continue to apply until there are no new COVID -19 cases in the exposed group for 14 days. UC Hastings Law will work with San Francisco Department of Public Health to ensure appropriate requirements are followed including consideration of returning to a campus virtualization based upon the circumstances. The requirements of Minor COVID- 19 Outbreaks in Section X I above, appl y with the following additions: 1. COVID -19 Testing : Provided to everyone in the exposed group, free of charge, regardless of vaccine status, or more frequently if recommended by Public Health. 6 Exposed group means all employees at a work location, working area, or a common area at work where a COVID - 19 case was present, at any time during the high- risk period, including in bathrooms, walkways, hallways, and waiting areas. An exposed group does not include (1) places where individuals momentarily pass through while everyone is wearing face coverings and not congregating, (2) the COVID- 19 case was not present at the site at the same time as other individuals, or (3) the COVID -19 case was wearing a face covering during the entire visit, which was less than 15 minutes du ring the high risk exposure period. 12 2. Respirators : Provided to everyone for voluntary use for everyone in the exposed group. If an individual in the exposed group opts not to wear the voluntary respirator, they are required to wear a face covering during the time period these requirements are applicable. 3. Physical Distancing or Solid Partitions : Any exposed group individual not wearing a respirator must be separated by at least six feet unless that separation is not feasible, except for momentary instances while individuals are in movement. If physical dis tancing cannot be maintained, UC locations must install cleanable solid partitions to reduce transmission. XIII. Ventilation and Indoor Air Quality Refer to Section IX above for measures undertaken by the College to improve indoor air quality. If you have concerns about ventilation in your area tha t are not addressed by the College's compliance with recommended measures from the San Francisco Department of Public Health and CAL- OSHA, we recommend that, as a mitigating factor, you continue to wear a face cov ering while on campus. XIV. Catering & Food Service All individuals serving or preparing food must follow the requirements listed below. For catering and food service on campus we recommend that meals be served, where feasible, in single use rather than buffet style dining. Individuals preparing or serving food must abide by the following requirements: o Ensure proper hand hygiene including regularly washing hands and using hand sanitizer when hand washing is not immediately available o Use face coverings and gloves, irrespective of vaccination status, while preparing or serving food If buffets or shared food is required based upon the circumstances of the event or activity, the following requirements apply: o Eliminate use of shared serving utensils where feasible, which can be accomplished by having staff who are properly masked and wearing gloves to serve food at the buffet o Provide sneeze guards where feasible XV. Travel Restrictions The CDC recommends that you delay travel until you are fully vaccinated. Once fully vaccinated, the CDC recommends that you wear a mask whole on forms of transportation domestically and internationally and that you self -monitor for COVID -19 symptoms after travel. Testing and self -quarantine are not recommended for individuals that are fully vaccinated. The College does not have any health -related constraints on travel at this time, 13 though this is subject to federal, state, and local requirements including a ny future travel notices from the CDC or Public Health.
