Price at time of publication: roomy | Wash Recommendations: Machine wash, tumble dry What the Experts Say \"I typically spend $15 to $18 per top and $20 to $22 per pant, which [is] pretty middle-of-the-road. I personally don't like the super inexpensive scrubs as they have a tendency to rip at the seams and seem to more readily absorb fluids, while the high-end scrubs tend to be fluid resistant and have antimicrobial properties, but don't withstand washing in hot water and drying on high heat.\" \u2014 Sarah Patterson, LVN, nurse from Southern California Best With Pockets Dickies Women's GenFlex Cargo Scrubs Pant Amazon View On Amazon View On Dickies.com View On Scrubsandbeyond.com Pros Front, back, and cargo pockets Stretchy material Drawstring waist Cons Low-rise waist is not ideal for active jobs Material attracts dust and lint For some medical professionals, the pockets on scrubs are the most important feature to look for when selecting a pair. The Dickies GenFlex Cargo Scrubs mirror cargo pants by incorporating a variety of pockets throughout the design. \"Pockets, pockets, pockets,\" Registered Nurse Danielle Pobre at VCUHealth System says. \"That's the one thing we need. As nurses, we end up putting things in our pockets such as alcohol pads, saline flushes, and more. We need to have easy access to these supplies right away as opposed to going back and forth to the supply room.\" Dickies GenFlex Cargo Scrubs have nine pockets for healthcare workers to utilize as they go about their shifts.

Some employers have become more lenient and allowed nurses and doctors to incorporate this style into their work looks. FIGS is one brand that has made its mark in the scrub industry for creating comfortable and durable clothes for medical professionals. \"I've been wearing FIGS for three years and they are as vibrant as the first day I got them,\" says Nacole Riccaboni, a board-certified registered nurse in Florida. \"They retain their color after multiple washes, the fabric doesn't stiffen or degrade after multiple washes, and unlike most scrubs, the inner thighs sections don't fall apart.\" FIGS are more of an investment given the price point, however, the durability of these scrubs can make them worth it depending on one's own work needs.

How We Selected the Best Scrubs When selecting scrubs for medical professionals, we spoke with doctors and nurses for their recommendations. Our list of medical professionals includes: Kristen Schiefer, MSPA, PA-C, Pediatric Neurosurgery, Savannah, Georgia Samantha Roecker, RN, Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Health System Nacole Riccaboni, APRN, Critical Care, Orlando Hospital Michael Cellini, DO, & Interventional Radiologist, New Jersey Portia Wofford, LPN, Georgia-based health content writer and former nurse manager Rebecca Abraham, RN, founder of Acute on Chronic LLC We then spent hours combing the web for the best and most effective products. After taking all of our options into consideration, we determined which to feature based on key criteria recommended by the experts: durability, functionality, fit, and style. Once we narrowed down our options, we compared the scrubs' benefits to their price tag. While some choices on our list may be more expensive, we wanted to give a wide range of options that would fit all needs and budgets. Based on all of these factors, we compiled this list of the best scrubs for medical professionals. What to Look for in Scrubs Durability Dealing with bodily fluids is a normal part of a healthcare provider's job, so you need scrubs that will stand up to the rigors of caring for patients as well as the rigors of your washing machine. \"If I'm going to spend $75 for a scrub set, it needs to last,\" Riccaboni says. \"I don't have the income to keep buying scrubs over and over.\" A pair of scrubs' ability to withstand wash cycles is the biggest indicator of if the pair will last. \"My scrubs experience many washes and I think the fabric itself is the most important in terms of longevity of the scrubs,\" says Dr. Cellini. \"Performance scrubs may cost a little more on average, but they tend to last longer than conventional scrubs.\" In other words, know what the care instructions are for the type of fabric used to make your scrubs; if it's notorious for fading or wearing down quickly, your items may not be able to keep up with what you need. \"I'm a professional, so my scrubs can't be full of old stains or just present as dingy,\" Riccaboni says. \"When my patients see me, I must establish trust quickly, and I respect that process. I show them I care about my appearance and come to work professionally and prepared.\" Functionality Ask pretty much any healthcare provider what one feature they want to see most on their scrubs and we guarantee the answer will resoundingly be \"pockets!\" No one likes to spend their entire day on their feet without any place to store their most-used items, whether it's a cell phone, pager, ID badge, stethoscope, or even a good old fashioned pen and pad. And not just any pockets will do, says Shiefer; there should be several of them, appropriately placed and sized so items fit well inside without falling out. Dr. Cellini agrees: \"A number of pockets is a plus\u2014I feel like I'm always carrying a lot of items on the job and the more pockets, the better!\" For Roecker, the placement of the pockets is the most important part of their function. \"My thing about pockets is I want them to be in a functional place,\" she says. \"I am looking for pockets that I can easily grab into and find what I need.\" Pockets that are \"in the front\" of the pants as well as \"a side pocket on the leg\" are two priorities for Roecker when shopping for scrubs. Fit and Style When you picture scrubs, you probably envision a boxy, loose-fitting, top and bottom set with a v-neck and drawstring waist. And while that is the classic scrubs look, many companies have been branching out to offer scrubs in different styles. \"I love that the joggers are acceptable now,\" Roecker says. \"As a runner, that is really cool to me.\" Styles like slim fit, mandarin collar, button-up, cargo, jogger, crew neck, and raglan sleeve are now available, because scrubs manufacturers know that healthcare professionals not only come in a variety of shapes, heights, and sizes, they also have widely different personal styles. \"I personally have a curvier shape and don't want my scrubs being too tight,\" Riccaboni says, who prefers straight-legged pants. \"My goal when buying scrubs is form and function. It doesn't matter how cute a scrub set is if it itches, rides up, or shrinks on the wash.\" For some professionals, finding a pair of scrubs that fits their personal aesthetic is one of their top concerns; Schiefer says that while she always prioritizes fabric over fit, she does ultimately want to look good in her scrubs and prefers pairs that fit well and are stylish. Frequently Asked Questions How often should scrubs be cleaned? Ideally, after every shift\u2014though that may not be necessary if you're not coming into contact with patients. Sarah Patterson, LVN, a nurse from Southern California, keeps her scrubs in a designated plastic hamper between wears, unless she knows she's been in contact with a patient's body fluids or in an isolation room. In those cases, she says, they go straight into the washing machine. How many pairs of scrubs do you need? It depends on how many shifts you work per week, as well as your ability to launder your scrubs appropriately (and any other factors, like how often your scrubs may become contaminated between patients). \"I like to have enough for the work week plus two extra sets,\" says Portia Wofford. \"When I worked three shifts per week, that meant five [sets in total]. However, Wofford notes that each nurse has to decide what works best for them and whether they need backup sets of scrubs (and if so, how many). Do colleges and hospitals provide scrubs for nurses? This can vary widely between individual colleges and hospitals.\"Some programs include scrubs as part of your tuition and fees,\" says Wofford. \"Others simply require nursing students to wear a specific color and you purchase your scrubs, independently.\"The college that Rebecca Abraham attended didn't provide scrubs, but her last ICU job at a hospital did; it was a huge convenience, she says, as it improved her work/life balance to be given a pair of clean surgical scrubs at work to change into every shift. Hospitals that don't provide scrubs completely free to employees may also make it easier for nurses to purchase them or \"earn\" free pairs, says Wofford: \"You may have to work for 90 days before you get a free set of scrubs, or you get a free set on your work anniversary.\" Some hospitals also sell scrubs in the gift shop, invite scrub companies to come on site to sell their items, and offer to deduct the cost of scrubs from their employees' paychecks. Do different color scrubs have different meanings? Usually, yes, there is some kind of distinction between the scrubs that nurses wear and the ones other healthcare providers wear when you're on-site at a hospital or larger medical facility.\"This helps the patient identify who is who on their care team,\" explains Abraham, \"[and] usually nurses are assigned some variation of blue.\"Wofford breaks down the various ways scrub colors can be used to distinguish between healthcare providers:Nurses may wear different color scrubs than other on-site employees Nurses on certain units wear specific colorsNurse managers or supervisors wear different colors than bedside nursesHowever, she also says it doesn't work this way all the time\u2014in some facilities, the color of your scrubs doesn't matter at all. What's the best way to clean scrubs? Generally, scrubs should be washed in hot water and then dried on high heat, though you'll want to read the care instructions beforehand to avoid damaging your pair.\"They have to be removed from the dryer right away and folded or they wrinkle like crazy, and no one has time to iron scrubs,\" says Kathryn Hively, a dental practice manager from South Jersey who orders scrubs for the staff in the office.As far as washing protocols, it depends on how dirty your scrubs are. Patterson says if she knows her scrubs are contaminated with a patient's germs, she washes them on a sanitize setting using Tide with bleach and Lysol laundry sanitizer.
