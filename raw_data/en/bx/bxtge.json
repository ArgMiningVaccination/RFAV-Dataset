The four most common cancers occurring worldwide are lung, female breast, bowel and prostate. A person's risk of developing cancer depends on different factors, including age, genetics, and exposure to some potentially known carcinogens and those which are believed to be carcinogenic. Some avoidable lifestyle factors including smoking can increase cancer risk. However, cancer risk factors are similar worldwide. Insufficient exercise, alcohol, imbalanced diet, and obesity, and various infections account for a considerable proportion of cancers worldwide.
