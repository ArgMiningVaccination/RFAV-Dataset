I remember early in my childhood noticing I had a sense of seeing the world differently and \"just knowing\" sense that was so familiar to me was a unique perspective. I remember being deeply curious and wanting to assist others in understanding themselves early on. Growing up in a family with dynamics of fight, survival, instability, passion, determination, and incredible duality created many layers to unpack in my healing journey. I learned how to be a warrior figuratively and literally; my father a beatnik hippie political artist, who gave his life to the art and teaching of Thai Boxing was a big influence of growth. On the other side of the spectrum, My mother, a powerful influence to impress the mindset of \"no matter what be happy\" even if every day she had a fear that we could loose everything; my mother a powers house and determined dreamer and manifester. My parents together were the energies of an inferno and a tornado that over filled my young earth sign taurus existence. As I grew up I fueled myself with the passion, fight, determination and headstrong stubbornness that I learned in my childhood. I knew in my first anatomy class in 7th grade that this was my path. I could feel that something was calling me. Through high school when my mother and I moved to the Palo Alto California I began my interests in physical therapy interning at a local clinic. I thought that my path was in sports, sports medicine and sports therapies. I was very athletic and accredited much of my body capabilities to learning to kick before I could walk (thanks dad.) In undergrad I received degrees in Athletic Injury Prevention & Rehabilitation and became a Certified Personal Trainer as well as studied Kinesiology emphasizing Sports Nutrition with a double major in Exercise Physiology. During which I found these studies lacking \"something\" and decided to co-study acupressure in my spare time. At the age of 20 I heard a loud intuitive voice sharing a glimpse of my future and what I would be capable of in the energetic rhelm. I remember years following this intuition that I was still so confused how I would ever attain such abilities. In 2006 as I was finishing up undergrad and aiming for Physical Therapy School I was introduced to Dr. Eric Rubin, a chiropractor in San Francisco, a BGI chiropractor. Now, I had experienced chiropractic regularly most of my life, but this was different. This one adjustment changed everything about me and I cried for 3 days straight with a life changing euphoric release. I began to come alive for the first time in my life and 5 days later I applied to chiropractic school. I can look back and say that I've never been one to hesitate and learned from a childhood of energetic bombardment that the only voice I was willing to listen to was my intuition, my inner knowing, my inner voice. In 2007 I entered Life West chiropractic school and took up studying Bio-geometric Integration (BGI) and diving deep into my commitment of mastery. I wish I could say that this was an easy road and that it came naturally but I was blocked. Majorly blocked. I fought myself to learn the subtlies of energy, of the field, of \"feeling\" and connecting. I had no clue how to \"DO\" any of this. So to maintain sanity, I split my studies and dove also into sports chiropractic and mastering the art of adjusting the spine and extremities while I struggled fueled by determination to \"get\" the energy world. In 2009 I had my first real sensory feeling in my heart. It was literally like that Jim Carrey movie The Grinche were his heart started to awaken. I met my first love, Sebastian, a 4 month old rescue. He amplified my \"FEEL\" in my heart and a physical sensation I could actually FEEL happened. In 2011 I graduated with clinical honors from chiropractic school and in the early months of 2012 began a sports focused practice in Lake Merrit Oakland inside a movement & wellness studio. In 2013 I had another life changing download to sell everything and moved back home to Oregon. Within 4 days I course changed and was Oregon bound. Living my life in synchronicities and intuition I eventually landed in Portland Oregon in 2014 and met my husband (another divine guided intervention a story for another day). In 2015 I opened Inner Essence Chiropractic and began building, literally by hand with plastering my own walls and renovations, a practice that would be the first to burst my energy sense open. I manifested my dream practice, my dream home, my dream partner and rooted in. I was shifting and expanding deep into my meditation practice I downloaded what I know call INBODIMENT. As leaving the bay area meant that I now was my own healer and didn't have access to the care I had come to fall in love with. I dove into meditation and began \"playing and asking\". Swirling energies, moving them, expanding and connecting through my own field. My meditation went from a 30 min to hours of downloading and playing in the field. I often found that most of the shifts happened at night where I would be \"woken up\" to process. Transformation was happened and it was tangible. Many \"weird\" experiences started to happy, one of which I remember at one point in the middle of the night, in trance, feeling like my body was elevated above the bed and in shock came out of trance to a feeling of my body making \"thud\". My awareness had opened and I was playing with energy. My chiropractic practice began to be my place of confirmation to what I was sensing. However, my path would take another turn in 2020 While visiting my in-laws, I received a download that we were to sell everything and move to Coeur d'Alene, ID and within the hour I had told my husband and we began the conversation and a week later the transition to liberate and uproot our life. Within that month my \"must move now\" became clear and the transition of our life began. My husband went north early and I went south to decompress with my mom. My husband and I agreed that after his father passed we would take a 6 month journey across the country. To me, this was a spiritual journey to deepen my understanding of myself and to find who Heidi really was. However, this trip wouldn't happen until a year later. After 3 weeks of visiting my mom, she convinced me to take a road trip, long story short, I was guided to spend the next 10 months in Big Bear where divine guidance connected me to a teacher that introduced me to Incan Shamanism where I now began hands-on experiencing of reading energy with a sense of structure which helped to make clear of details and expanded my energy capacity, the learning journey I didn't know I was destined for. When I heard in my intuition that I was going on a journey I figured it was traveling, I had no clue that it was a journey into the world of energy and dimensions. Though in Dec 2021 we eventually made the journey across the country which was more of an integration than an activation, stories that will eventually make themselves into a book. It was through deep surrender, excessive hours of meditation, deep self compassion, healing the wounded refugee, healing the fighter, healing the rebel, the immense anger, and going all or nothing into showing up big we landed in Coeur d'Alene on my birthday April 22, 2022 (or 4/4/4). Our first night here I received am image in meditation of coming to a mountain size skidding to a halt. I had been in motion for almost 2 years and finally had \"arrived.\" I could go on and on with all the schronicities, feel free to ask me, but for now, it was now time to step in and the Universe lit the path covered in hearts and feathers. I am here to play in the energy world, to play big, to move big, to dive into the fields, to hear, to see, to sense the frequencies that I had been playing with over the years but now I have been catipulted to mastery and I landed here raw and humbled in deep gratitude. As the journey continues into today, It has without a doubt, taken me to levels beyond my wildest imaginations of what is capable with sense and connection, between two people near and far, where distance matters none. I can say that each day I learn, I see and I heal. I am this path and it is me. I am here to be the change. I am here to shift this planet. I know my role and have been summoned, placed into position and guided to assist in the ascension of our species. My gifts I offer are tangible, powerful and deep. My teaching are here to make sense of the unexplainable, the tools are to be put into action to create change. They were discovered through my own struggle to make it \"work\" and \"make sense\". I do not offer fluffy concepts that sound pretty. I offer you a foundation to do it yourself. TO TRANSFORM.
