This ancient form of medicine is derived from the philosophy that illness is caused by an imbalance of vital energies in the body. In modern terms, acupuncture works by improving blood flow and allowing more oxygen to reach the body tissue. At Lake Norman at Mooresville Animal Hospital, we use acupuncture as a supplement to other rehabilitative therapies to help relieve pain and promote healing in your pet. The Acupuncture Technique Acupuncture involves inserting tiny needles into an animal's body at precise points called meridians, where the blood vessels converge with the nerves. The needles help guide vital energy along these meridians, supporting the nervous system and promoting circulation while enhancing the body's healing abilities. Common Acupuncture Uses Our vets often recommend the use of acupuncture or other types of Chinese medicine for several issues, including: [Pain Management](#) Medical treatments such as chemotherapy can feel very uncomfortable for your pet. They will often be combined with acupuncture to relieve some discomfort, helping your cat or dog to fight their illness. [Musculoskeletal Issues](#) Acupuncture can often be used for injury rehabilitation. Conditions such as arthritis, nerve injuries and hip dysplasia also tend to respond well to acupuncture. [Dermatology & Skin Issues](#) Acupuncture treatment can help encourage increased circulation, which can help hot spots, granulomas and allergic dermatitis. It can also improve healing and reduce pain, leading to less itching and subsequent over-grooming. [Gastrointestinal Issues](#) Acupuncture may stimulate digestive secretions, which helps to promote healthy digestive activity. Conditions such as diarrhea or nausea may benefit from increased blood flow. [Respiratory Issues](#) The immune-calming and anti-inflammatory capabilities of acupuncture treatment can improve asthma, allergies and other conditions. The Benefits of Acupuncture There are several benefits of acupuncture for pets, including: - Pets in poor health will benefit from the lack of systemic side effects - Lowers the number of waste products produced - Helps relax muscles and relieve pain - Improves metabolic waste removal from the body - Promotes an increased blood flow which boosts oxygen in tissues "}
