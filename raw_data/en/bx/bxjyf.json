Balancing through Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Axis The mechanism of [acupuncture](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-acupuncture) that is specific to hormonal balancing is that acupuncture acts on the hypothalamus-pituitary-axis (HPA) which is the brain's master controller of hormone function.

The body can then respond adaptively to the stimulation of the internal and external environment to maintain a steady state. It is suggested that acupuncture can regulate the body's function through adjusting the neuro-endocrine-immune network through a common set of chemical information molecules and receptors among the neural, endocrine and immune systems. One of the mechanisms that acupuncture can achieve balance of the body is by regulating the release of neurotransmitters, neuropeptides and hormones by stimulating the neuroendocrine system. In addition, acupuncture can also indirectly affect the immune system by regulating the neuroendocrine system, specifically embodying the substances released by the neuroendocrine system acting on the corresponding receptors of immune organs and immune cells. Another mechanism of how acupuncture balances through the neuro-endocrine-immune network is acting as an effective physical stimulus to activate local cell functions and neuroreceptors, regulate release of related chemicals in microenvironment and then further activate the neuro-endocrine-immune system.
