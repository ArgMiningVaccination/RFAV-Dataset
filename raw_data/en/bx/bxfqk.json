TECS is a complex intervention involving people, process and technology, therefore results are dependent on all these elements. The evidence is based o n a range of methodologies and can - in some contexts - provide mixed messages on the clinical and cost -effectiveness of TECS. It would therefore be impractical and unhelpful to try and provide a definitive list of all studies on all TECS in all clinical a reas. This database provides a list of individual studies as well as a link to a single key paper for selected as selected clinical areas. The lists are limited to the most recent studies and may not be exhaustive. They are intended to help those conside ring TECS how these solutions might best address their needs. Some resources may need to be purchased and in many cases the link is to a summary of the paper rather than the full content. 1.
