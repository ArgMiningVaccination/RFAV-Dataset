In-depth information is provided on the standard of repair or palliation and on the role of different imaging techniques, especially CT and MRI, in the evaluation of these patients. Each chapter includes a detailed imaging protocol and describes the management appropriate to particular conditions and circumstances. Congenital heart disease (CHD) is one of the most common inborn defects. The success in treating CHD in children, even when they have complex cardiovascular defects, is resulting in a steady increase in the number of adults with CHD who need to be followed up clinically and by imaging owing to the potential for late sequelae. In providing expert, up-to-date guidance on selection of imaging modality, image interpretation, and management, this book will be a valuable resource for all radiologists, cardiologists, and pediatricians who are responsible for the care of adult and adolescent patients with CHD. -- Provided by publisher. - DigitalGeorge Hartofilakidis, George C.

Total hip replacement (THR) performed using optimal techniques can achieve a radical improvement in the quality of life of adult patients. This book offers in-depth coverage of all aspects of CHD in adults and its treatment. Relevant information is first provided on the basic anatomy of the hip and OA of the hip and on the classification, epidemiology, and natural history of CHD. The now limited role of femoral and pelvic osteotomies is carefully evaluated, and the use of THR is then considered in detail. Indications and preoperative planning are discussed, and the available operative techniques, analyzed. Clear guidance is provided on overcoming major technical difficulties, and the benefits of particular approaches and techniques are highlighted. More than 180 images and numerous case studies complement this reader-friendly text. The book will be an invaluable tool for orthopedic surgeons, rheumatologists and radiologists. - DigitalDiva D.

With no medical options offered beyond amputation of the leg, she turned to her own training for help. She began to massage the skin and subcutaneous fascia of the sacral bone and pelvic crest with pulling strokes. After several applications, she experienced less back pain, increased circulation to the leg, and within three months, disappearance of all symptoms. This was the beginning of Dickes systematic, scientifically based treatment method of connective tissue massage (or Bindegewebsmassage), now in wide use throughout the world. In this book, practitioners will get the first detailed, how-to description of connective tissue massage (CTM) {in the English language} including the principles, knowledge, and skills to implement it. Special Features: Begins with the origin and practical benefits of CTM, including its neuroanatomical and neurophysiological basis, Explores the relationship between the sensory, motor, and autonomic nervous systems and the complex reflex mechanisms that are activated by CTM therapy, Describes and illustrates specific stroking techniques that trigger the appropriate neural reflexes in every body segment, Shows how to make a diagnostic assessment based on skin, connective tissue, and muscle zones, Covers the full range of orthopedic, neurological, internal medicine, and gynecologic disorders that can be effectively treated with CTM. Complete with treatment plans, indications and contraindications, and modern medical guidelines, this book is essential for all physical and massage therapists and osteopaths who want to successfully integrate CTM into their practices. It is also a fascinating reference for physicians and other medical professionals who are interested in learning more about this important manual technique.\" --Provided by publisher.Digital Access [Thieme MedOne Education Duncan T.

Horticultural crops, as high-value crops, have an important role to play in revitalizing rural economies and can add significantly to national economies. Moreover, horticulture provides more than twice the number of jobs compared to traditional cereal crop production, and the shifting of conventional agriculture towards high-value horticulture has increased employment opportunities in developing countries. To exploit this potential, researchers need a vast array of horticultural genetic resources and information on new traits. Horticultural crops, which are only a part of PGRFA (Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture), are characterized by a wide and varied range of species. In fact, there are five major horticultural crop groups: fruit and nut crops, vegetables, food legumes, roots and tubers, and lastly the ornamental and medicinal group. In this context, the present book provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of conservation and utilization of horticultural genetic resources, addressing contemporary approaches to conservation in connection with different technologies, including biotechnological approaches as practised in India and in some cases, globally. It includes a brief chapter on the unique nature of horticultural genetic resources, providing a rationale for viewing them as being distinct from field crop genetic resources. Subsequent chapters share insights on protocols for the conservation of selected horticultural crops ex situ, and focus on the increased need to complement these efforts with in situ conservation approaches. Geospatial tools are also briefly described, emphasizing their utility with regard to mapping and managing resources. The book also explores the wild gene pool in horticulture crops; discusses legal aspects related to horticultural genetic resources and biotechnological aspects; and describes the key aspects of sustainable management and replenishment. Given its scope, the book offers a valuable resource for all horticulturists, graduate students, researchers, policymakers, conservationists, and NGOs engaged in horticulture in particular and biodiversity in general. - Digitaleditors: P.E.

In this, the Third Edition of the highly successful Conservation Biology: Foundations, Concepts, Applications, the authors address their interdisciplinary topic as it must now be practiced and perceived in the modern world. Beginning with a concise review of the history of conservation, the authors go on to explore the interplay of conservation with genetics, demography, habitat and landscape, aquatic environments, and ecosystem management, and the relationship of all these disciplines to ethics, economics, law, and policy. An entirely new chapter, The Anthropocene: Conservation in a Human-Dominated Nature, breaks new ground in its exploration of how conservation can be practiced in anthropogenic biomes, novel ecosystems, and urban habitats. The Third Edition includes the popular Points of Engagement discussion questions used in earlier editions, and adds a new feature: Information Boxes, which briefly recap specific case histories described in the text. A concluding chapter offers insight into how to become a conservation professional, in both traditional and non-traditional roles. The authors, Fred Van Dyke and Rachel Lamb, draw on their expertise as field biologists, wildlife managers, consultants to government and industry, and scholars of environmental law, policy, and advocacy, as well as their many years of effective teaching experience. Informed by practical knowledge and acquired skills, the authors have created a work of exceptional clarity and readability which encompasses both systemic foundations as well as contemporary developments in the field. Conservation Biology: Foundations, Concepts, Applications will be of invaluable benefit to undergraduate and graduate students, as well as to working conservation scientists and managers.

Novel and more precise molecular technologies now allow experts in the field of mammology to interpret data in a more contextual and empirical fashion and to better describe the evolutionary and ecological processes that are responsible for the patterns they observe. The book also demonstrates how recent advances in genetic/genomic technologies have been applied to assess the impact of environmental/anthropogenic changes on the health of small populations of mammals. It examines a range of issues in the field of mammalian conservation genomics, such as the role that the genetic diversity of the immune system plays in disease protection and local adaptation; the use of noninvasive techniques and genomic banks as a resource for monitoring and restoring populations; the structuring of population by physical barriers; and genetic diversity. Further, by integrating research from a variety of areas - including population genetics, molecular ecology, systematics, and evolutionary and conservation biology - it enables readers to gain a deeper understanding of the conservation biology of mammals that are at increasing risk of extinction at local, regional and global scales. As such, it offers a unique resource for a broad readership interested in the conservation biology of mammals and conservation management strategies to better preserve biodiversity. - DigitalRodrigo book aims to be a comprehensive review of the literature on the conservation genetics of the New World crocodilians, from the biological and demographical aspects of the living species to the application of molecular techniques for conservation purposes. It covers the current status of the molecular genetics applied to phylogenetics, phylogeography, diversity, kinship and mating system, and hybridization, as well its implications for decision making with regards to the conservation of these species at academic and governmental levels. This book can be used as a guide for graduate and undergraduate students to understand how conservation genetics techniques are carried out and how they can help preserve not only crocodilians but also other living species\"--Publisher's website. - DigitalDavid Johns.Whilst the science of conservation biology is thriving as a discipline, ultimately global conservation is failing. Why, when the majority of people say they value nature and its protection? David Johns argues that the loss of species and healthy ecosystems is best understood as human imposition of a colonial relationship on the non-human world - one of exploitation and domination. Global institutions benefit from transforming nature into commodities, and conservation is a low priority. This book places political issues at the forefront, and tackles critical questions of conservation efficacy. It considers the role of effective influence on decision making, key policy changes to reduce human footprint, and the centrality of culture in mobilising support. It draws on political lessons from successful social movements, including human anti-colonial struggles, to provide conservation biologists and practitioners in scientific and social science disciplines and NGOs with the tools and wider context to accelerate their work's impact. - Digitaledited by William J. Sutherland, Peter N.M. Brotherton, Zoe G. Davies, Nancy Ockendon, Nathalie Pettorelli, Juliet A. Vickery.Conservation research is essential for advancing knowledge but to make an impact scientific evidence must influence conservation policies, decision making and practice. This raises a multitude of challenges. How should evidence be collated and presented to policymakers to maximise its impact? How can effective collaboration between conservation scientists and decision-makers be established? How can the resulting messages be communicated to bring about change? Emerging from a successful international symposium organised by the British Ecological Society and the Cambridge Conservation Initiative, this is the first book to practically address these questions across a wide range of conservation topics. Well-renowned experts guide readers through global case studies and their own experiences. A must-read for practitioners, researchers, graduate students and policymakers wishing to enhance the prospect of their work 'making a difference'.

Dabezies, Jr. ; associate editors, James V. Aquavella Access Howard I. Maibach, editors.Contact urticaria is an immediate but transient localized swelling and redness that occurs on the skin after direct contact with an offending substance. It is caused by a variety of compounds, such as foods, preservatives, fragrances, plant and animal products, metals, and rubber latex and the mechanism by which these provoke an immediate urticarial rash at the area of contact can be divided into two categories: non-immunological contact urticaria and immunological (allergic) contact urticaria. Non-immunological contact urticaria typically causes mild localized reactions that clear within hours, e.g. stinging nettle rash. This type of urticaria occurs without prior exposure of a patient's immune system to an allergen. Immunological contact urticaria occurs most commonly in atopic individuals (people who are prone to allergy). Hence prior exposure to an allergen is required for this type of contact urticaria to occur. While there have been other texts written on the subject over the last decade, this book is intended as an easily accessible guide for dermatologists and residents, as well as general practitioners, summarizing the most important concepts that will help physicians identify the signs and symptoms of Contact Urticaria Syndrome in their daily clinical practice. Each chapter is laid out in the following format: Concepts, Tools and Algorithms of Diagnosis and Management, a Clinical Case for each entry, and Recommendations. Additionally, the Volume Editors have worked to provide a global approach to this syndrome using internationally standardized requirements for diagnosis. - DigitalM.

However, while much has been written about this theory's influence on the psychotherapy techniques used with adults, little attention has been paid to its practical clinical applications in psychotherapeutic work with children and adolescents. This book explains how the new concepts derived from contemporary psychodynamic theory have made it necessary to revise our understanding of and approach to young patients in psychotherapy. It reviews the recent contributions from contemporary two-person relational psychodynamic theory and employs detailed case examples to bring to life this theory's practical applications in child and adolescent psychotherapy. Psychotherapists and students of psychotherapy will find this book a valuable source of information on contemporary psychodynamic theory and a useful resource for introducing a contemporary style into their practice, co-constructing with the patient a narrative to achieve the desired goals. - DigitalA. Samy Youssef, editor.This text is designed to function as a comprehensive guide/companion that will not only facilitate the decision-making process for the surgeon, but also help young surgeons build a successful career in skull base surgery. It is divided into six main sections: The first section details the general principles that every skull base surgeon needs to be acquainted with - skull base anatomy, developing a multidisciplinary skull base team, operating room equipment, surgical instruments, and modern imaging technologies. These are the key elements that play a major role in optimizing functional outcomes and patients quality of life. Following this, the compartmental anatomy chapters set the stage for understanding the technical and surgical nuances of each location. The subsequent five sections are organized as anatomical compartments or regions of the skull base. Every region is organized in the same format for uniformity and ease of use. Each section includes the available treatment choices to each compartment, and describes the relevant pathologies. The contribution of worldwide leaders including neurosurgeons and otolaryngologists provides top-level expertise in how to tackle each pathology. The surgical approaches chapters that lead each anatomical section describe operative techniques in a clear. stepwise fashion with accompanying intra-operative photos and surgical videos. In the individual pathology chapters, different pathological subtypes are described with representative radiographic images of clinical case examples. Accompanying each pathology is a treatment algorithm based on tumor morphology, pre-operative clinical status, and the goal of maximum functional preservation with a brief description of surgical approaches. This will serve as a roadmap that will help the reader to easily reach a decision of how to treat each skull base pathology. The general theme is functional and anatomical preservation of key neurovascular structures. Setting such structures as a target and planning an approach that minimizes iatrogenic damage to these structures will lead the surgeon down the road of either open, endoscopic, or a combination of both approaches. A comprehensive book that is versatile to serve as a handbook as well as a detailed reference for skull base surgery does not currently exist. In addition, combining the two main surgical schools represented by endoscopy and open surgery into one reference enhanced by treatment algorithms is another unique feature. . - DigitalTobias S.

One current debate is whether activity in sensorimotor areas during language comprehension is automatic. Numerous neuroimaging studies reveal activity in perception and action areas during semantic processing that is automatic and independent of context, but increasing findings show that involvement of sensorimotor areas and the connectivity between word-form areas and sensorimotor areas can be modulated by contextual information. Context Effects on Embodied Representation of Language Concepts focuses on these findings and discusses the influences from word, phrase, and sentential contexts that emphasize either dominant conceptual features or non-dominant conceptual features.

A wide range of key clinical aspects are addressed, with explanation of status epilepticus classification, criteria for institution of monitoring, seizure patterns and their recognition, quantitative EEG analysis, and neuroimaging in patients undergoing cEEG monitoring. The value of cEEG and the nature of cEEG findings in various special situations are then reviewed, covering particular pathologies, critical care considerations, and prognostication. Treatments of nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) and nonconvulsive seizures (NCS) are discussed. The concluding section is devoted to important administrative issues including billing, staffing issues, comparison of EEG machines, and information technology (IT) issues. Continuous EEG monitoring offers the only reliable means of detecting seizures that are not clinically obvious in critically ill patients. Such seizures are common: approximately 20% of patients undergoing cEEG monitoring in hospital have NCSE or NCS. Against this background, many hospitals have started to offer cEEG monitoring as a basis for delivery of appropriate treatment. By presenting the state of the art in cEEG monitoring, this book will be invaluable to practitioners including neurophysiologists, neurologists, neurointensivists, intensivists, neurophysiology and epilepsy fellows, and neurology residents. - Weiping Jia, editor. - Digitaledited by Peter Kleinebudde, Johannes Khinast, Jukka Rantanen.\"This book covers key aspects of the continuous manufacturing of pharmaceuticals.

Allen, Carrie A. Cwiak, editors.Women with chronic medical problems are at higher risk for complications during pregnancy and, therefore, they are especially in need of appropriate preconception and contraception care. Furthermore, many women with chronic medical problems do not obtain adequate preconception and contraception care. Despite published guidelines by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there is a substantial gap in medical practice regarding the use of contraception in women with co-existing medical problems. Contraception for the Medically Challenging Patient fills the gap that currently exists in the knowledge of correct contraceptive prescribing practice and shows that inappropriate contraindications can easily become a barrier to effective contraception use among women. Chapters highlight obsolete views about appropriate candidates for contraception and address the complex contraceptive needs of today's medically challenging patients with HIV/AIDS, uterine fibroids, or cardiac, neurologic or thyroid disease. The book gives attention to recommendations on the use of contraception in women with medical problems such as diabetes, obesity, epilepsy, and lupus, among others, and provides comprehensive information regarding the effects that certain drugs may have on contraceptive hormone levels. While national guidelines do exist for contraceptive eligibility, this book discusses in more detail the evidence behind the guideline recommendations and the nuances that clinicians confront in daily practice. - Digitalauthors: Shayne C.

CEDM is a relatively new breast imaging technique based on dual energy acquisition, combining mammography with iodine-based contrast agents to display contrast uptake in breast lesions. It improves the sensitivity and specificity of breast cancer detection by providing higher foci to breast-gland contrast and better lesion delineation than digital mammography. Preliminary results suggest that CEDM is comparable to breast MRI for evaluating the extent and size of lesions and detecting multifocal lesions, and thus has the potential to become a readily available, fast and cost-effective examination. With a focus on the basic imaging principles of CEDM, this book takes a practical approach to breast imaging. Drawing on the editors' and authors' practical experience, it guides the reader through the basics of CEDM, making it especially accessible for beginners. By presenting the key aspects of CEDM in a straightforward manner and supported by clear images, the book represents a valuable guide for all practicing radiologists, in particular those who perform breast imaging and have recently incorporated or plan to incorporate CEDM into their diagnostic arsenal. - DigitalMarc Lobbes, Maxine S.

As the management of severe traumatic brain injury remains one of the most complicated and controversial areas of neurosurgery, trauma care and critical care medicine, it will serve as a helpful reference and guide to the impact of potential therapeutic interventions. Each chapter is organized by the proposal of a commonly encountered clinical question, addressing the current evidence for a variety of treatments, outlining the relevant questions on the topic that have not been adequately addressed in the literature, summarizing the options for treatment and the level of evidence upon which each is based, and finally proposing questions yet to be addressed in the literature. The text identifies ongoing questions for future research relevant to the topic at hand as well as providing a comprehensive educational reference for resident and fellowship training. Controversies in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury Management will become an invaluable resource and data point for neurosurgeons, neurointensivists, trauma surgeons and other healthcare professionals involved in the care and treatment of TBI patients. - Digital[edited by] Andrew S.

Recently published** evidence however, suggests that the anaesthetist's contribution to cardiac surgical mortality is very small, suggesting that - at least in the UK - there is no such thing as a bad cardiac anaesthetist either!!! As with many textbooks, it was inevitable that the second edition was fatter and heavier than the first as we sought to cover more topics in greater detail. In considering a third edition, the consistent feedback (sometimes blunt) was to delete less frequently read chapters and return to the original remit - a small, concise, portable reference focusing on key points for trainees in the first six months of subspecialty training. We warmly welcome Andy Roscoe, a recognized international authority on transoesophageal echocardiography, as an editor. Under Andy's stewardship, we are confident that future editions of this book will be in safe hands. In the third edition, we cover many of changes that have occurred since publication of the second edition - a huge expansion in ECMO (a four-letter word in many centres), increased numbers of cardiology procedures undertaken in cardiac catheter laboratory and hybrid operating theatre, and the tentative return of aprotinin into clinical practice. In larger cardiac surgical centres there has been a gradual separation of cardiothoracic anaesthesia from critical care, with the latter becoming a specialty 26 in its own right. Many intensive topics are well covered in a sister publication, Core Topics in Cardiothoracic Critical Care, 2nd Edition and these are referenced in the text. We are extremely grateful to our contributors for their forbearance and to Cambridge University Press for their seemingly endless patience\"-- Provided by publisher. - Digitaledited by Kamen Valchanov, Nicola Jones, Charles W Hogue.Most patients with critical cardiac or thoracic conditions will at some stage pass through the cardiothoracic critical care unit.

Development of the cerebral cortex, the center for higher brain functions such as cognition, memory, and decision making, is one of the major targets of current research. The cerebral cortex is divided into many areas, including motor, sensory, and visual cortices, each of which consists of six layers containing a variety of neurons with different activities and connections. As this book explains, such diversity in neuronal types and connections is generated at various levels. First, neural stem cells change their competency over time, giving sequential rise to distinct types of neurons and glial cells: initially deep layer neurons, then superficial layer neurons, and lastly astrocytes. The activities and connections of neurons are further modulated via interactions with other brain regions, such as the thalamocortical circuit, and via input from the environment. This book on cortical development is essential reading for students, postdocs, and neurobiologists. - Digitalvolume editors, Emanuela Arvat, F. Pecori Giraldi, A.G.

Fang, editor.Cotton fiber is the most important natural fiber used in the textile industry. The physical structure and chemical compositions of cotton fibers have been extensively studied. Newer high speed spinning instruments are being deployed around the world that demand longer, stronger and finer fibers. Consequently, genetic improvement in fiber quality has been stressed. With improvement in fiber quality has come the realization that further fiber improvement will require a better understanding of fiber development and biology. As a consequence, cotton fiber developmental biology, genetics and genomics have become focal points in the cotton research community. As the longest single-celled plant hair, cotton fiber has been used as an experiment model to study trichome initiation and elongation in plants. This book provides a comprehensive update on cotton fiber physics, chemistry and biology that form the three sections of the book.^In the physics section, the physical structure of cotton fiber is first illustrated in great detail. Then a suite of fiber properties and their measuring methods are described. The pros and cons of each method are outlined. New methods to measure physical properties of single fiber and young developing fibers are included. In the chemistry section, the chemical compositions of cotton fibers are described in detail. This knowledge is necessary for efficient modification of cotton fibers for better and broader utilization. The advancement in cotton fiber modification using chemical and enzymatic methods opened new ways to utilize cotton fibers. In the biology section, the book first introduces the utilization of naturally occurring color cottons. Color cottons possess unique attributes such as better fire retardant ability. Advancement in understanding fiber color genetics and biochemical pathways and new utilization of color cottons are discussed.^Recent technological advancements in molecular biology and genomics have enabled us to study fiber development in great depth. Many genes and quantitative trait loci related to fiber quality attributes have been identified and genetically mapped. Some of these genes and QTLs are being used in breeding. Progresses in cotton fiber improvement using breeding and biotechnology are discussed in the last chapter. This book serves as a reference for researchers, students, processors, and regulators who either conduct research in cotton fiber improvement or utilize cotton fibers. - DigitalShakeel Ahmad, Mirza Hasanuzzaman, editors.This book provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of the recent developments in cotton production and processing, including a number of genetic approaches, such as GM cotton for pest resistance, which have been hotly debated in recent decades.

Spanning the years 1900 to 1977, The Covenant of Water is set in Kerala, on South India's Malabar Coast, and follows three generations of a family that suffers a peculiar affliction: in every generation, at least one person dies by drowning-and in Kerala, water is everywhere. At the turn of the century, a twelve-year-old girl from Kerala's long-existing Christian community, grieving the death of her father, is sent by boat to her wedding, where she will meet her forty-year-old husband for the first time. From this unforgettable new beginning, the young girl--and future matriarch, known as Big Ammachi--will witness unthinkable changes over the span of her extraordinary life, full of joy and triumph as well as hardship and loss, her faith and love the only constants. A shimmering evocation of a bygone India and of the passage of time itself, The Covenant of Water is a hymn to progress in medicine and to human understanding, and a humbling testament to the difficulties undergone by past generations for the sake of those alive today.

Each chapter provides a distinct contribution to the new and rapidly growing literature on the developing COVID-19 pandemic from the vantage points of fields ranging from civil and environmental engineering to public policy, from urban planning to economics, and from public health to systems theory. Contributing chapters to the book are both scholars and active practitioners, who are bridging their applied work with critical scholarly interpretation and reflection. The book's primary purpose is to empower stakeholders and decision-makers with the most recent research in order that they can better understand the systemic and sweeping nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as which strategies could be implemented to maximize socioeconomic and public health recovery and adaptation over the long-term. - DigitalNicola Vargas, Antonio M. Esquinas, editors.This book describes the issues and challenges that clinicians encountered in the management of older critically ill patients during the Covid-19 pandemic, and offers practical information on how to manage them. Older adults are more susceptible to complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as a result of viral pneumonia. In addition, they often have multiple comorbidities and are commonly frail, which means their various organs and systems, such as the respiratory system, have reduced functional reserves. As such, older adults are less able to react to acute stressors. During the current Covid-19 pandemic, older adult patients' mortality is increased. Further, the infection and death rates of elderly people in nursing homes and health care institutions are high. Management of older adults with Covid is complicated. The reduced availability of beds may limit their access to ICU. Moreover, the prognosis may be poor, and airway management and ventilation strategies have to take into account various clinical and physiological characteristics specific to older patients. This book is addressed to all allied professionals involved in the management of older critically ill patients and presents information collected and practical lessons learned from the clinical daily management of this population during the pandemic. - DigitalPrem Misir.This book highlights and suggests remedies for the racial and ethnic health disparities confronting people of color amid COVID-19 in the United States. Racial and ethnic health disparities stem from social conditions, not from racial features, that are deeply grounded in systemic racism, operating through the White racial frame. Race and ethnicity are significant factors in any review of health inequity and health inequality. Hence, any realistic end to racial health disparities lies beyond the scope of the health system and health care. The book explores structuration theory, which examines the duality between agency and structure as a possibly potent pathway toward dismantling systemic racism, the White racial frame, and racialized social systems. In particular, the author examines COVID-19 with a focus on the segregated health system of the US. The US health system operates on the doctrine of \"separate but equal\" whereby the dominant group has access to quality health care and people of color have access to a lesser quality or zero health care. \"Separation\" implies and enforces inferiority in health care. Through the evidence presented, the author demonstrates that racial and ethnic health disparities are even worse than COVID-19. As in the past, this contagion, like other viruses, will dissipate at some point, but the disparities will persist if the US legislative and economic engines do nothing. The author also raises consciousness to demand a national commission of inquiry on the disproportionate devastation wreaked on people of color in the US amid COVID-19. COVID-19 may be the signature event and an opportunity to trigger action to end racial and ethnic health disparities. Topics covered within the chapters include: Introduction: Segregation of Health Care Systemic Racism and the White Racial Frame Dismantling Systemic Racism and Structuration Theory COVID-19 and Health System Segregation in the US is a timely resource that should engage the academic community, economic and legislative policy makers, health system leaders, clinicians, and public policy administrators in departments of health.

With no practical guidelines in place, Italian doctors were called to fight against an unknown disease. For the first time in modern history, healthcare workers and decision-makers had to find rapid solutions to a life-changing health crisis with no evidence-based recommendations or procedures in place to guide their actions. Sharing the lessons learned from this experience, and offering practical tips on implementing future programs for pandemic preparedness, the book is a valuable tool for medical practitioners and health-policy-makers wanting to better understand the complexity of the current and future global health crises. - DigitalDeborah Wallace, Rodrick Wallace.This book is the first social epidemiological study of COVID-19 spread in New York City (NYC), the primary epicenter of the United States. New York City spread COVID-19 throughout the United States. The context of epicenter formation determined the rapid, extreme rise of NYC case and mortality rates. Decades of public policies destructive of poor neighborhoods of color heavily determined the spread within the City. Premature mortality rates revealed the \"weathering\" of policy-targeted communities: accelerated aging due to chronic stress. COVID attacks the elderly more severely than those under the age of 60. Communities with high proportions of prematurely aged residents proved fertile ground for COVID illness and mortality. The very public policies that created swaths of white wealth across much of Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn destroyed the human diversity needed to ride out crises. Topics covered within the chapters include: Premature Death Rate Geography in New York City: Implications for COVID-19 NYC COVID Markers at the ZIP Code Level Prospero's New Castles: COVID Infection and Premature Mortality in the NY Metro Region Pandemic Firefighting vs. Pandemic Fire Prevention Conclusion: Scales of Time in Disasters An exemplary study in health disparities, COVID-19 in New York City: An Ecology of Race and Class Oppression is essential reading for social epidemiologists, public health researchers of health disparities, those in public service tasked with addressing these problems, and infectious disease scientists who focus on spread in human populations of new zoonotic diseases.

Yates, Michael R. Markiewicz, editors.The book provides a framework for diagnosis and treatment of the complex facial deformities found in craniofacial microsomia and Treacher Collins syndrome. These conditions are difficult to treat due to their complexity and variable presentation. The deformities may be mild or severe and merely cosmetic to life-threatening in nature. These conditions often manifest as complex facial deformities that require multiple surgical interventions. Timing is critical when treating these patients and knowing and choosing the correct operation is key to successful outcomes. This work provides a comprehensive approach in treating these complex patient populations, seeking to answer the following questions: When to operate versus when to wait? If operating is required what operation should be performed? What is the best orthodontic approach to the associated dental deformities that develop with these conditions? How should sleep apnea be evaluated and treated in this population? What is the best management for feeding patients with these conditions? Written by experts in the field, Craniofacial Microsomia and Treacher Collins Syndrome: Comprehensive Treatment of Associated Facial Deformities aims to provide the reader with literature based best practices in treating these children from the NICU through childhood and into adulthood. - Digital [Craniofacial muscles : a new framework for understanding the effector side of craniofacial muscle control](https://login.laneproxy.stanford.edu/login?url=https://link.springer.com/openurl?genre=book&isbn=978-1-4614-4465-7)Linda K. McLoon, Francisco Andrade, editors.Of the approximately 640 muscles in the human body, over 10% of them are found in the craniofacial region. The craniofacial muscles are involved in a number of crucial non-locomotor activities, and are critical to the most basic functions of life, including vision, taste, chewing and food manipulation, swallowing, respiration, speech, as well as regulating facial expression and controlling facial aperture patency. Despite their importance, the biology of these small skeletal muscles is relatively unexplored. Only recently have we begun to understand their unique embryonic development and the genes that control it and characteristic features that separate them from the skeletal muscle stereotype.This book is the most comprehensive reference to date on craniofacial muscle development, structure, function, and disease. It details the state-of-the-art basic science of the craniofacial muscles, and describes their unique response to major neuromuscular conditions. Most importantly, the text highlights how the craniofacial muscles are different from most skeletal muscles, and why they have been viewed as a distinct allotype. In addition, the text points to major gaps in our knowledge about these very important skeletal muscles and identified key gaps in our knowledge and areas primed for further study and discovery. - DigitalAlex M.

Part one sets the stage by establishing the rationale for creating a Lifestyle Medicine Center as well as the medical and economic burden it seeks to alleviate. The construction of the physical facility and all of the myriad details of the program and its key players are covered in part two, from the structural to the aesthetic, including informatics, developing patient resources and education tools, current technologies and applications, the role of the dietitian and exercise physiologist, inpatient consultation, the importance of community engagement, and more. Part three is comprised of case studies of existing, successful Lifestyle Medicine Centers across the country, with detailed descriptions of their history, development, programs and challenges. Chapters are supported with plentiful figures, tables and useful links. The burden of chronic disease in the U.S. and globally is growing, with pervasive direct and indirect multi-scale adverse effects on health and well-being, economics, and quality of life. Notwithstanding the remarkable progress in biomedical technology, the role of lifestyle medicine in managing chronic disease in a preventive care model is paramount; however, the relevant and effective education in lifestyle medicine is lacking. Translating the theory into action steps, instantiated by case studies with critical interpretations and problem-solving tools, Creating a Lifestyle Medicine Center is the go-to resource for family and primary care physicians, internal medicine physicians, and all clinical specialties interested in planning and developing a lifestyle medicine program. - DigitalJames S.

It provides a comprehensive overview of relevant sources of literature and user complaints that clearly demonstrate the consequences of lack of attention to health in current building design and planning. Current designing of energy-efficient buildings is mainly focused on looking at energy problems and not on addressing health. Therefore, even green buildings that place environmental aspects above health issues can be uncomfortable and unhealthy, and can lead to public health problems. The authors identify many health risk factors and their parameters, and the interactions among risk factors and building design elements. They point to the need for public health specialists, engineers and planners to come together and review built environments for human wellbeing and environmental sustainability. The authors therefore present a tool for holistic decision-making processes, leading to short- and long-term benefits for people and their environment. - Digital [Creating significant learning experiences : an integrated approach to designing college courses.

Indeed, CRF has been associated with a range of states of the brain, including fear and anxiety, social contact, and incentive salence and addiction. Examining the evolutionary origins of CRF, its diverse endocrine and neural functions, this book provides insights into CRF that will be of interest to students and researchers in the biological, medical and behavioral sciences.\"--Page 4 of cover. - Digital [Crib death-- Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) : sudden infant and perinatal unexplained death : the pathologist's viewpoint. Second edition. [2nd ed.]](https://login.laneproxy.stanford.edu/login?url=https://link.springer.com/openurl?genre=book&isbn=978-3-319-08346-9)Giulia Ottaviani.Crib death or sudden infant death syndrome is surely among the worst emotional tragedies that any parent can experience. It is the most frequent death-causing syndrome during the first year of life, striking one infant in every 700-1,000. Crib death is a great enigma, and one of the main open issues in the social-medical and scientific setting of contemporary medicine. Despite a wide spectrum of theories and years of research, its etiology remains unclear. The scarcity of knowledge in the field of crib death and its pathology has led to continued and growing concern, prompting an expanding search for explanation that will permit either prediction or rapid diagnosis. This book describes systematic studies of the cardiovascular system and autonomic nervous system carried out in a large number of infants, newborns, and fetuses who have died suddenly and unexpectedly, as well as in age-matched control cases. The cardiovascular and neuropathological findings are presented in detail, and the relationship between crib death and unexplained perinatal death is discussed. This monograph will aid pathologists, forensic pathologists, pediatricians, obstetricians, and neonatologists in recognizing all morphological substrata. It puts forward a well-researched standardized postmortem protocol to be applied in all cases of sudden unexpected infant and perinatal death. - Digital [Crisis management in acute care settings : human factors and team psychology in a high stakes environment.

Robinson, Dasha and bulimia nervosa are serious disorders affecting pre-adolescents, adolescents and adults with high levels of co-morbidity, disability and mortality. The medical manifestations of these disorders are intrinsic to the illness and its treatment; some are secondary to malnutrition whereas others are the result of purging or other weight-controlling behaviours and a further group is due to poor management of nutritional problems. This book focuses on the role of the psychiatric, medical, nutritional and psychiatric assessment and management of severely ill patients with anorexia nervosa. Leading clinicians and researchers address the essentials of risk assessment, the identification of complications and the monitoring of treatment progress. Location of care and the role of the team are fully addressed, with due consideration of legal and ethical issues. Practical guidelines are included on risk assessment, management of acute and chronic physical problems, feeding during treatment and consent, as outlined in the MARSIPAN (2010) and Junior MARSIPAN (2012) documents.

The book begins with an overview of the concept of critical psychiatry before focusing its analytic lens on the DSM diagnostic system, the influence of the pharmaceutical industry, the crucial distinction between drug-centered and disease-centered approaches to pharmacotherapy, the concept of \"de-prescribing,\" coercion in psychiatric practice, and a range of other issues that constitute the targets of contemporary critiques of psychiatric theory and practice. Written by experts in each topic, this is the first book to explicate what has come to be called critical psychiatry from an unbiased and clinically relevant perspective. Critical Psychiatry is an excellent, practical resource for clinicians seeking a solid foundation in the contemporary controversies within the field. General and forensic psychiatrists; family physicians, internists, and pediatricians who treat psychiatric patients; and mental health clinicians outside of medicine will all benefit from its conceptual insights and concrete advice. - Digital [Critical rehabilitation for partial and total knee arthroplasty : guidelines and objective testing to allow return to physical function, recreational and sports activities](https://login.laneproxy.stanford.edu/login?url=https://link.springer.com/openurl?genre=book&isbn=978-3-030-87003-4)Frank R. Noyes, Sue Barber-Westin, editors.Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a frequently performed operation - in the U.S. alone, 5.2 million TKAs were performed from 2000-2010 - and partial (unicompartmental) knee arthroplasty (UKA) is another common operation that is done in younger, active individuals. Many patients require knee arthroplasty from osteoarthritis that develops after sports injuries or decades of participation in athletics. While much has been written regarding technical surgical details of arthroplasty, there is comparably little available on critical rehabilitation principles and guidelines that allow return to normal physical function, as well as recreational and sports activities. Filling this gap in the literature, this group of internationally recognized surgeons and therapists discusses all aspects of critical rehabilitation following both partial and total knee replacement, including: Advances in surgical techniques for robotic computer-navigated knee arthroplasty Effects of preoperative rehabilitation and nutrition on postoperative function Specific rehabilitation principles to avoid complications and return to daily activities Advanced physical therapy concepts to return to recreational and sports activities Objective testing to determine strength and physical function in the arthroplasty athlete Recommended guidelines for recreational and sports activities Key factors for achieving high patient satisfaction and quality of life after surgery Presenting the most up-to-date evidence and guidelines, Critical Rehabilitation for Partial and Total Knee Arthroplasty will be an invaluable resource for orthopedic surgeons, physical therapists, athletic trainers, personal trainers and all professionals caring for patients seeking to return to full activity after knee replacement. - Digitaledited by R.K.

The uses and impact of the different imaging techniques in daily practice and research are thoroughly examined, with coverage of ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance. In addition, emerging trends are scrutinized. The background to the book is an increasing perception that intestinal inflammation and complications are underdiagnosed using standard endoscopic or surgical techniques. Patients with Crohn's disease usually require multiple reassessments during their lifetimes and often favor noninvasive techniques with a low risk of complications. These factors have reinforced the need for effective cross-sectional imaging techniques. Additionally, the expanding use of biologic agents, combined with their increased efficacy, expense, and risk, justifies the use of these techniques (particularly ultrasound and magnetic resonance) to monitor disease treatment and objectively measure inflammation and healing. Cross-Sectional Imaging in Crohn's Disease will be of high value for both gastroenterologists and diagnostic radiologists. - DigitalKhaled M. Elsayes, editor.This book offers concise descriptions of cross-sectional imaging studies of the abdomen and pelvis, supplemented with over 1100 high-quality images and discussion of state-of-the-art techniques. It is based on the most common clinical cases encountered in daily practice and uses an algorithmic approach to help radiologists arrive first at a working differential diagnosis and then reach an accurate diagnosis based on imaging features, which incorporate clinical, laboratory, and other underlying contexts. The book is organized by anatomical organ of origin and each chapter provides a brief anatomical background of the organ under review; explores various cross-sectional imaging techniques and common pathologies; and presents practical algorithms based on frequently encountered imaging features. Special emphasis is placed on the role of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In addition to algorithmic coverage of many pathological entities in various abdominopelvic organs, unique topics are also examined, such as imaging of organ transplant (including kidney, liver and pancreas), evaluation of perianal fistula, and assessment of rectal carcinoma and prostate carcinoma by MRI.

Joseph Schoepf, editor.This book is a comprehensive and richly-illustrated guide to cardiac CT, its current state, applications, and future directions. While the first edition of this text focused on what was then a novel instrument looking for application, this edition comes at a time where a wealth of guideline-driven, robust, and beneficial clinical applications have evolved that are enabled by an enormous and ever growing field of technology. Accordingly, the focus of the text has shifted from a technology-centric to a more patient-centric appraisal. While the specifications and capabilities of the CT system itself remain front and center as the basis for diagnostic success, much of the benefit derived from cardiac CT today comes from avant-garde technologies enabling enhanced visualization, quantitative imaging, and functional assessment, along with exciting deep learning, and artificial intelligence applications. Cardiac CT is no longer a mere tool for non-invasive coronary artery stenosis detection in the chest pain diagnostic algorithms; cardiac CT has proven its value for uses as diverse as personalized cardiovascular risk stratification, prediction, and management, diagnosing lesion-specific ischemia, guiding minimally invasive structural heart disease therapy, and planning cardiovascular surgery, among many others. This second edition is an authoritative guide and reference for both novices and experts in the medical imaging sciences who have an interest in cardiac CT. - DigitalGiorgio Ascenti, Angelo Vanzulli, Carlo Catalano, Rendon C.

An introductory section presents information on the physical and technical background of DECT and considers nonspecific and specific software advantages. Clinical applications of DECT in the evaluation of retroperitoneal viscera are then addressed in detail with the help of high-quality illustrations. Particular attention is devoted to the most recent DECT study protocols, software, and applications in aortic, renal, pancreatic, and adrenal disease. A number of case studies are reported that elucidate the advantages of DECT, and the relevant literature is extensively discussed. The book closes by considering radiation dose and dose-saving measures. The simple and practical approach offered by this book will assist radiologists in the optimal routine use and interpretation of DECT in different retroperitoneal sites and radiology technologists in the choice of settings parameters.

While the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome is relatively straightforward, there is much debate regarding the most efficient diagnostic methods, appropriate non-surgical management, and surgical management of cubital tunnel syndrome. This unique book is sensibly divided into three thematic sections. Part one reviews the relevant anatomy and presents the physical exam and diagnostic test modalities, along with non-surgical treatment strategies such as splinting and injections as well as the role of physical therapy. Surgical treatment strategies are discussed in detail in part two, including decompression, anterior transposition, minimal medial epicondyectomy and ulnar motor nerve transfer. Management of the failed release is highlighted here as well. Part three describes outcomes, acute and chronic complications and rehabilitation. Case material will be included where appropriate to provide real-world illustration of the presentations and procedures discussed. Practical yet comprehensive, Cubital Tunnel Syndrome will be an excellent resource for orthopedic, hand and plastic surgeons, trainees and residents, with content that will also be useful for physical therapists and rehabilitation specialists. [Cue-centered therapy for youth experiencing posttraumatic symptoms : a structured multi-modal intervention, therapist guide](https://login.laneproxy.stanford.edu/login?url=https://academic.oup.com/book/1236)Victor G. Carri\u00f3n.\"Trauma can be defined as exposure to a shocking, distressing, or emotionally painful event that can result in negative mental and physical health effects. Due to its interference with development, childhood trauma is particularly detrimental and can result in symptoms including posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders, depression, dissociation, externalizing behavioral problems, and suicidal ideation. It can increase the risk of substance use, school disengagement, and academic difficulties, and it has been associated with attentional impairment, cognitive performance, and the development of self-regulation. Cue-Centered Therapy for Youth Experiencing Posttraumatic Symptoms presents a psychosocial treatment approach for children and adolescents who have been exposed to chronic traumatic experiences. Cue-Centered Therapy (CCT) derives its name from its focus on the conditioning process that results in sensitivity towards trauma-related cues. CCT addresses four core domains: cognition, behavior, emotions, and physiology, through a combination of empirically supported and CCT-specific interventions. This structured and flexible Therapist Guide focuses on helping the youth develop insight into his/her own patterns of behaviors and emotions. Rather than having youth attempt to \"unlearn\" maladaptive responses conditioned to cues, CCT focuses on creating new connections and behavioral responses. The treatment manual offers guidelines on conducting each of the sessions while respecting the individual therapist's own strengths. Through the use of visual icons, forms, and figures, the manual facilitates teaching relevant lessons. The therapy reduces negative cognitions, allows for emotional expression, identifies and changes trauma-related responses, empowers with knowledge and skills, and strengthens the relationship between the caregiver and his/her child\"-- Provided by publisher \"Cue-Centered Therapy for Youth Experiencing Posttraumatic Symptoms presents a psychosocial treatment approach for children and adolescents who have been exposed to chronic traumatic experiences\"-- Provided by publisherDigital Access [Oxford U Press [2016]](https://login.laneproxy.stanford.edu/login?url=https://academic.oup.com/book/1236)LocationVersionCall - Cohen, ; Richard Turbo, escritor.The most up-to-date, expert advice for mothers, fathers, and care providers from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the most respected organization on child health; this is the essential resource for all parents who want to provide the very best care for their children.Digital Access [AAP ebooks 2017](https://login.laneproxy.stanford.edu/login?url=https://publications.aap.org/aapbooks/book/642/Caring-for-Your-Baby-and-Young-Child-6th-Ed) - by MSc, RD, CDE, CIEC, and Deborah Kennedy PhD\"A Focus on Creating Delicious, Healthy Food to Support Mental Health.

Rowland, Emmanuele A. Jannini, editors.The aim of this book is twofold: to promote an awareness of cultural differences in connection with sexual medicine among health care providers, and to demonstrate how such differences are relevant to the care and treatment of patients with sexual issues. Individual sexuality represents the cumulative effects of biological, psychological, and cultural influences. Yet much of the study of sexuality--including issues ranging from sexual identity to sexual response--has been conducted through a Western lens. Although a substantial body of work in anthropology has taken up the study of human sexuality from a cross-cultural perspective, two points are notable. First, this work seldom crosses the desks of medical and psychological health practitioners, and second, the relevance of specific cultural differences is rarely apparent to the typical sexual health practitioner. To address this situation, this book adopts a global perspective, focusing on how cultural practices and values can impact health care, treatment, and outcomes. In this regard, it covers three broad domains: Sexual Identity and Orientation; Sexual Response and Dysfunction; and Sexual Diversity. Each chapter consists of two parts: a general description of the relevant issues, and a discussion of how these issues can be relevant to clinical practice. The book offers a valuable, practical tool for specialists in sexual medicine and sexual psychology, for sexual healthcare givers, and for sexological researchers who want to better serve their patients by developing an awareness of and sensitivity to cultural differences, and by providing a framework for dealing with issues of sexuality and sexual health that takes cultural values into consideration, while adhering to best practices in patient care. - DigitalNeelam A. Vashi, editor.This book addresses the importance of the physicians' understanding on how varying ethnic and cultural identities can affect dermatological disease presentation in patients. It bridges the gap in knowledge for practicing dermatologists, especially those not studying or practicing in a highly multi-ethnic center who may not be exposed to patients from a variety of cultures. Concise and cohesive, the book examines how dermatoses can manifest due to cosmetic practices, therapeutics, religious practices, cultural hair-related practices, and environmental variables. These elements underscore that without exposure to patients of varying backgrounds, it can be nearly impossible to learn about practices that may influence a patient's health. There are many examples of cultural practices causing dermatologic lesions, and it is becoming increasingly more likely that practicing dermatologists will encounter patients with these findings as migration, tourism, and public interest continue to rise. Socially conscientious and relevant, Cultural Practices and Dermatoses covers everything from more common cultural practices, such as acupuncture and threading, to lesser known ones, like pew blisters and turban ear, as there is limited medical literature describing their cutaneous effects and complications. - Digitalvolume editor, Renato D.

Ellis Fletcher.The healthcare workforce and landscape continues to evolve with the ongoing education systems forming in foreign countries and immigration and foreign employment continuing to grow in the United States. Every heath care provider and patient is challenged with cultural competency and acceptance on a daily basis. Often times our own prejudices and beliefs have great potential to interfere with effective health care interactions when what is truly important is providing the best patient care possible. There is much discussion around cultural sensitivity and cultural expertise, but now the discussion has shifted to cultural sensibility, which is a deliberate behavior that proactively provides an enriched provider consumer/patient interaction, where the health care provider acknowledges cultural issues and situations through thoughtful reasoning, responsiveness, and discreet (attentive, considerate, and observant) interactions. In this highly practical and informative handbook, author Sally Ellis Fletcher offers healthcare providers a process that encourages them to first consider their own attitudes, biases, beliefs, and prejudices through self-reflection.

It would provide a unique opportunity to separate the impacts of how reproductive technologies have affected different species and their contributions to food production. Lastly, no publication has been compiled that demonstrates the relationship between developments in reproductive management tools and food production that may be used a reference for scientists in addressing future research areas. During the past 50 years assisted reproductive technologies have been developed and refined to increase the number and quality of offspring from genetically superior farm animal livestock species. Artificial insemination (AI), estrous synchronization and fixed-time AI, semen and embryo cryopreservation, multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (MOET), in vitro fertilization, sex determination of sperm or embryos, and nuclear transfer are technologies that are used to enhance the production efficiency of livestock species. - Digitaleditors, Myron R.

Additionally, they also presented as a method to overcome chemoresistance by supplementing conventional therapeutic regimens with targeted therapies. However, the development of resistance to these combinatorial approaches has led to the reassessment of currently available therapeutic options to overcome resistance to targeted therapy. This book aims to provide an update on the advancements in the therapeutic arms race between cancer, clinicians and scientists alike to overcome resistance to targeted therapies. Subject experts provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges and solutions to resistance to several conventional targeted therapies in addition to providing a discussion on broad topics including targeting components of the tumor microenvironment, emerging therapeutic options, and novel areas to be explored concerning nanotechnology and the epigenome. - DigitalMaria Dorobanu, Frank Ruschitzka, Marco Metra, editors.Evolving concepts on the basic mechanisms of heart failure -- Assessment of left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction -- Right ventricular dysfunction in heart failure -- The role of atrial functional assessment in heart failure -- Assessment of secondary mitral regurgitation -- Assessment of left ventricular contractile reserve in heart failure -- Role of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in heart failure -- The evolving role of multimodality imaging in heart failure -- Contemporary pharmacological treatment of heart failure -- Myocardial revascularization in heart failure -- Approach to arrhythmia in heart failure -- Implantable defibrillator therapy -- Cardiac resynchronization therapy -- Mechanical circulatory support -- Cell and gene therapy in heart failure -- Valvular Surgery in Heart Failure -- Percutaneous Valvular Therapies in Heart Failure -- Pretransplant evaluation -- Strategies for improving outcomes in heart transplantation -- Heart failure and hypertension -- Right heart failure -- Acute heart failure -- Heart failure in oncologic patients -- Iron Deficiency in Heart Failure -- The kidney and electrolyte imbalances in heart failure -- Prognostic factors and risk scores in heart failure -- Rehabilitation therapy in patients with heart failure. . - Digitaleditor, Johannes H\u00e4berle.Foreword : current approach to hyperammonemia / Johannes H\u00e4berle -- Ammonia metabolism in humans : production and removal / Daniel Rabier -- Neurobiology of ammonia / Vicente Felipo -- Ammonia toxicity to the brain / Olivier Braissant -- Oxidative and nitrosative stress in Marta Skowro\u00f1ska & Jan Albrecht -- Preanalytical and analytical aspects of ammonia determination / Camilla Scott & Simon Olpin -- Inherited disorders leading to hyperammonemia in children / Arunabha Ghosh & Andrew Morris -- Inherited disorders leading to hyperammonemia in adults / Valerie Walker -- Role of cerebral ammonia toxicity in hepatic encephalopathy / Natalia Qvartskhava, Markus S.

The therapeutic efficacy of the widely prescribed \"gold standard,\" continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), is compromised by low patient acceptance and compliance. In light of the limitations of CPAP and other forms of conservative therapy (e.g., mandibular advancement devices), there is a growing tendency to explore and expand the role of surgery in the treatment of mild, moderate, and severe sleep apnea. New insights and developments in pathophysiology, surgical techniques, and implants have opened the way to increased success in treating sleep apnea surgically. This new work by leading international specialists provides a detailed, evidence-based approach to selected advanced surgical techniques, beginning with patient selection criteria, discussion of indications for and against surgery, choice of procedure (also in combinations), and more. Key Features: - Systematic, practice-oriented approach to examination, diagnosis, and treatment - Step-by-step description of surgical concepts and techniques - Superbly illustrated with full-colored photographs and drawings - Focus on those procedures that have been shown to be successful in specific situations - Discussion of outcomes, success rates, risks, and potential complications; where evidence-based data are not available, expert opinion is provided Current Concepts of Sleep Apnea Surgery will be welcomed by residents, fellows, and board-certified surgeons in otorhinolaryngology and head and neck surgery\"-- Provided by publisher.

It discusses in detail the successes achieved using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), including developments with regard to conjugated mAbs and also bispecific mAbs as novel treatment options for leukemia and solid tumors. It also examines the advances toward personalized immunotherapy, focusing on the effectiveness of adoptive cell therapy using genetically engineered T cells with tumor-associated antigen-specific T-cell receptors and chimeric antigen receptors, as well as the role of tailored vaccines based on the patient's cancer mutanome. Further, it describes the impressive therapeutic results recently achieved with checkpoint inhibitors, and analyzes novel strategies to modulate the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Written by leading international experts and providing up-to-date information on emerging strategies, such as oncolytic virus-based therapy, epigenetic therapy, and combination therapy, the book appeals to all those with an interest in immunotherapy as it comes of age.LocationVersionCall NumberItemsClick on Series link(s) access options degeneration -- Classification of age-related macular degeneration / George Trichonas & Peter K.

This book offers a wide and up-to-date overview of the multidisciplinary treatment of melanoma. Among the topics discussed, there are the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy and the radical dissection, following the results of international randomized clinical trials, in particular MSLT-II. The last chapters are focused on new medical treatments in adjuvant, neoadjuvant, and metastatic settings. The volume has been written for all the professionals involved in melanoma treatment, such as general surgeons, surgical oncologists, medical oncologists, dermatologists, radiotherapists, and nuclear medicine physicians. - .C882 - Digital [Current microbiological research in Africa : selected applications for sustainable environmental management](https://login.laneproxy.stanford.edu/login?url=https://link.springer.com/openurl?genre=book&isbn=978-3-030-35296-7)Akebe Luther King Abia, Guy R. Lanza, editors.Scientific output in low- and middle-income countries is greatly challenged by numerous factors. This is particularly pronounced in sub-Saharan African countries, despite the continent being the world's second largest and second most-populous continent, currently undergoing rapid economic growth. Financial constraints and unclear areas of focus when funding is available, are among the limiting factors, with the consequence being the development of inadequate policies, especially those relating to environmental protection and conservation. This 13-chapter book is a unique piece in the field of microbiology, designed to stimulate some research areas in Africa by illustrating interesting and informative examples of the current applied research agenda in environmental microbiology in selected countries within the continent. With authors from the North, South, East and West of Africa, the book touches diverse applied methods and approaches to meet the pragmatic needs faced by environmental microbiologists in Africa. Also included are topics on viruses, bacteria (including cyanobacteria), and protozoa, and their importance in disease. Sustainable agriculture and aquaculture, and eco-friendly oil and hydrocarbon bioremediation and degradation approaches are highlighted. Microbial involvement in different common indoor (e.g., household kitchens, latrines, and hospitals) and outdoor settings including air, soil, and water habitats, and their resistance to commonly used antibiotics, are described. Hopefully, the work presented here will stimulate the need for increasing modern training and funding initiatives to prepare African microbiologists to meet the challenges they face in African universities and research laboratories. - Digitaleditors, Joseph LaDou, Robert J.

The FRCS exam is an end-of-training examination for Orthopaedic trainees in the UK. There is a paucity of textbooks published in the UK which cover the spectrum of knowledge required. The updated edition builds on the success of the first edition. This book is divided into 18 chapters, which cover the entire remit of clinical orthopaedics. The chapter on sports injuries has been split into two chapters - disorders of the hip and disorders of the knee. A unique feature which has been retained is the incorporation of annotated bibliography within the text. The list of references has been provided as 'further reading suggestions' at the end of the chapter. The annotated text within the chapter helps the reader to understand the study design and key message from the article. The articles selected for inclusion in the text are seminal articles, or recent articles which have led to change in practice. The line drawings are simple and easy to reproduce. Classifications are presented pictorially as much as possible, instead of tables, and this helps memorisation.

The articles tackle both humoral and cellular immunity, and their interconnectivity. The former involves B cells that recognize invading pathogens and create the antibody-mediated response, which when memorized provides future immunity. The latter involves mostly T cells, exemplified by cytotoxic or killer cell destroying the pathogens, or helper cells stimulating B cells to produce antibodies to bind and neutralize the pathogens. T cells act through release of cytokines, interleukins, and other bioactive mediators. Neutrophils play a key role in innate immunity against bacterial infections. The process of NETosis is a recently unraveled sophisticated defense mechanism, consisting of the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps that catch, immobilize, and remove pathogens from the body. Dysfunction of immunity is indisputably conducive to the propensity for infections, particularly respiratory tract infections, as the airways are the first line of defense against invading pathogens. Pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt to avoid detection by the immune system. The case in point is the influenza virus. The articles report on the epidemiology, diagnostics, serology, complications, and the process of acquired immunity due to vaccination against influenza and influenza-like infections in recent epidemic seasons. The book is a blend of medical research and practice. It is intended for academic scientists, research scholars, clinicians, family doctors, and healthcare professionals. - DigitalLothar Mueller, Frank Eulenstein, editors.This book presents definitions, key concepts and projects in landscape research and related areas, such as landscape science and landscape ecology, addressing and characterising the international role, status, challenges, future and tools of landscape research in the globalised world of the 21st century.

Guidance on how to use techniques for tissue preparation, staining, handling and image acquisition are also provided enabling the reader to develop confidence in integrating this technique into their day-to-day practices. Furthermore, this atlas also provides an update on the ongoing latest advances in the field. Cutaneous Atlas of Ex Vivo Confocal Microscopy covers how to apply these techniques into dermatological practice, especially in Mohs surgery for the evaluation of keratinocytic neoplasm and in dermatopathology for rapid evaluation of varied skin lesions. It is therefore a valuable resource for trainee, residents, practicing dermatologists and dermatopathologists who are seeking a resource to assist in developing their knowledge and skills of utilizing these methodologies. - DigitalMurat Durdu.Sampling and staining of specimens for cutaneous cytology is broadly known to be one of the simplest, fastest, most reliable and inexpensive methods for the diagnosis of skin diseases, based as it is on the investigation of peculiar features in individual cells. This book illustrates the best practices in cutaneous or diagnostic cytology, and how cellular material is obtained by means of scraping, slit-skin smear, touch smear or fine needle aspiration, depending on the type of skin lesion. Starting from clinical lesions, the reader is provided with fundamental information on the correct preparation and staining of slides. Today, dermatological cytology is commonly used in the diagnosis of various erosive vesiculobullous, pustular, granulomatous, and tumoral skin lesions, but extending its use could be highly beneficial. Accordingly, this practical and richly illustrated book, explicitly dedicated to professionals and practitioners in the field of pathology and dermatology, outlines and encourages the intensified use of this method in daily practice. . - DigitalKelly H. Tyler, editor.From the unique perspective of a board certified obstetrician/gynecologist turned board certified dermatologist comes a much needed text focusing solely on the cutaneous disorders that occur during pregnancy. Written with the insider knowledge that education on pregnancy dermatoses is often underrepresented in OB/GYN and family medicine programs, this text will aid these practitioners in correctly assessing these issues and discussing next steps with their patients so that the topic of skin disease is no longer a struggle. Although dermatologic disease in pregnancy is part of the curriculum in dermatology residencies, dermatologists and other physicians also may not feel as comfortable prescribing topical or systemic treatments in their pregnant patients. This book will not only provide in-depth information about physiologic skin changes in pregnancy, pregnancy dermatoses, and pre-existing skin disease in pregnant patients, but treatment options and medication safety for various conditions will be covered in detail. Cutaneous Skin Disorders of Pregnancy is developed by dermatologists and OB/GYNs and will serve as an invaluable resource for General Dermatologists, Obstetricians/Gynecologists, Family Medicine doctors and midwives who deliver and/or care for pregnant women. - DigitalJohn C.

In recent years, many reports have been published on pediatric dermatological disorders and accidental injuries that were unjustly regarded as physical signs of child abuse. Knowledge of the differential diagnosis of unexplained skin findings is essential for accurate diagnosis and of vital importance given that errors in either direction (false positive or false negative) can have disastrous consequences. - DigitalCharles M.

Almost all mushroom fatalities are due to the genus Amanita, whose poetic common names (death cap, destroying angel) attest to their lethality. In his classic 1986 book, Theodor Wieland covered the state of our knowledge about the chemistry and biochemistry of the toxins of Amanita mushrooms up until that time, with a particular focus on the decades of chemical research by him and the Wieland dynasty (including his father, brother, brother-in-law, and cousin). Wieland's book is now mainly of historical interest, with its exhaustive overview of the early chemical studies done without benefit of methods taken for granted by modern chemists. This book is a complete top-to-bottom revision of Wieland's 1986 book. The material covers history, chemistry, and biology with equal thoroughness. It should be of interest to natural products chemists and biologists, professional and amateur mycologists, and toxicologists. The three scientific fields that are most relevant to the book are natural products chemistry, mycology, and fungal molecular genetics. Dr. Walton is an expert in all three. To maximize the broad utility and appeal of the book, care has been taken to define all technical terms specific to a particular discipline, so that, for example, mycologists will be able to understand the relevant chemistry, and chemists will be able to understand the relevant fungal biology. - Digitaledited by Mar Orz\u00e1ez, M\u00f3nica Sancho Medina, Enrique P\u00e9rez-Pay\u00e1.Immunoprecipitation of complexes kinase activity / Edurne Gallastegui and Oriol Bachs -- Expression and purification of recombinant cyclins and CDKs for activity evaluation / Edurne Gallastegui and Oriol Bachs -- Expression and purification and CDK9 of inhibitor complexes for structural determination / Asterios I.

Written by experts in the field, the text outlines the progressive nature of CF as well as the impact of this autosomal recessive disease on the respiratory, gastrointestinal, endocrine, rheumatologic, and renal systems, as well as the patients mental health. The book begins with a chapter describing the history of cystic fibrosis and how the face of this life-shortening disease has changed over the past several decades. The following chapters elucidate the pathophysiology of how cystic fibrosis impacts each organ system. Current management and therapeutics are detailed with step-by-step guidelines for clinicians. This book is unique in that it highlights the entire person, not just the respiratory system, with detailed inclusion of the patient perspectives throughout, informing practice standards and considerations. This is an ideal guide for pediatric and adult physicians who care for patients with cystic fibrosis, as well as respiratory therapists, physical therapists, nurses, nutritionists, and pharmacists who care for these patients. - DigitalDouglas Lewis, editor.Cystic fibrosis is a disease that affects the entire body. It tends to be thought of as primarily a pulmonary disease since pulmonary decline is the main factor in early mortality. Because of the multi-system nature of the disease, a better understanding of cystic fibrosis expands the family physician's understanding of subjects ranging from genetics to pulmonary function to nutrition to colon transport to hydration to electrolyte management. The primary care philosophy is unique in that it always considers how a narrow problem can affect an individual globally. Cystic Fibrosis care can often feel fractured to patients as they are sent to multiple specialists to deal with problems outside of the comfort level of a prior or current specialist. With a broad medical philosophy, care is more inclusive as clinicians can manage topics such as diabetes and preventive care without multiple referrals and additional appointments. Family physicians are well-positioned and well-qualified to competently meet many of the care needs of those with cystic fibrosis. This book is edited by a family medicine physician who has specialist level experience with the disease. It opens with a background on cystic fibrosis foundations and centers to familiarize the reader. The next chapter gives a basic overview of the disease. Each of the subsequent chapters provide a comprehensive look at how cystic fibrosis affects other areas of the body that the primary care physician should be familiar with. Major components of cystic fibrosis such as physiology, spirometry, inflammation, airway clearance, chronic infection, cystic fibrosis related diabetes and pancreatic insufficiency, among others, are thoroughly explained. Written by experts in the field, Cystic Fibrosis in Primary Care appeals to all family physicians as well as specialists, residents, medical students physician assistants and nurse practitioners alike. - DigitalOscar H.

Nowadays, the disease is the most common helminthic infection of the nervous system in humans, and a major cause of acquired epilepsy. It has long been endemic in developing countries of Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, the Indian subcontinent, and Southeast Asia. Recently, however, mass migration from endemic to non-endemic areas and growth in overseas travel have resulted in an increase in the prevalence of cysticercosis in countries where it was formerly considered exotic. The introduction of modern neuroimaging and serologic techniques has improved the diagnosis of neurocysticercosis, and the development of potent cysticidal drugs has changed the prognosis of most affected patients. Nevertheless, much remains to be learned about this parasitic disease. This book provides a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the various aspects of cysticercosis of the nervous system that will be of interest to all who are involved in the care of patients with the disease. Epidemiology, neuropathology, immunopathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management are all thoroughly discussed based on current evidence and practice. - Digital/PrintJong Hoon Park, Curie Ahn, editors.Part 1.

The management approach is clearly detailed for each potential presentation, including CME occurring in association with uveitis, diabetes mellitus, vitreoretinal interface changes, retinal vascular occlusions, and lens-induced pathology. The guidance takes full account of the continued expansion in medical treatment options due to the development of new drugs and the increased availability of minimally invasive surgical procedures. Additionally, since therapeutic approaches to CME depend on a clear understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms and the structural changes in the vitreous and neurosensory retina revealed by imaging studies, these aspects are carefully considered as well. - Digital [Cyto- and myeloarchitectural brain atlas of the ferret (Mustela putorius) in MRI aided stereotaxic coordinates](https://login.laneproxy.stanford.edu/login?url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-76626-3)Susanne Radtke-Schuller.Description This stereotaxic atlas of the ferret brain provides detailed architectonic subdivisions of the cortical and subcortical areas in the ferret brain using high-quality histological material stained for cells and myelin together with in vivo magnetic resonance (MR) images of the same animal.

The genetics of Cytokine Storm Syndromes are being defined with many of the risk alleles giving rise to mutations in the perforin-mediated cytolytic pathway used by CD8 cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells. These are being studied using murine models. Up to 10% of the general population may carry risk alleles for developing Cytokine Storm Syndromes, and Cytokine Storm Syndromes are being increasingly recognized around the world in pediatric and adult hospitals. A variety of infectious, rheumatic, and oncologic triggers are commonly associated with Cytokine Storm Syndromes, but understanding this disorder is critical for all researchers and physicians to ensure timely and appropriate therapy. This textbook, the first of its kind, addresses all aspects of the disorder - from genetics, pathophysiology, and ongoing research, to clinical presentations, risk factors, and treatment. - Digitaledited by Arnaud Echard. - Digital[edited by] Edmund S.

With cytopathology at the forefront of diagnosis and prognostication of neoplastic lesions, it is essential that physicians involved in the diagnosis and treatment of precancerous lesions and cancer have a clear understanding of specimen collection techniques, terminology for reporting, and outcomes in various diagnostic categories. This book provides a comprehensive overview of the role of cytology at various body sites. The diagnostic details covered are abbreviated in comparison with those in pathology texts. Instead, a more clinical approach is taken, with the focus on the advantages and limitations of techniques and the key features of entities that are important to clinicians. Pathological clinical correlation is highlighted throughout the book, ensuring that it will be highly relevant for clinicians.

It not only allows the geometric and signaling dimensions of cells, but is also very important in physiological processes. The book discusses the recent studies showing the role of actin and microtubule cytoskeleton interactions in cell-wall assembly and dynamics. The authors examine the role of both microtubules in the mechanics of plant cells, and actin filaments in the motility of chloroplasts. Based on recent advances in the study of the acto-myosin complex using high-resolution microscopy, they propose a new model for intracellular transport in plants. Exploring an almost-forgotten field of bioelectricity in the context of the cytoskeleton, the book highlights connections between the dynamic actin filaments and the bioelectricity of membranes and demonstrates that the plant cytoskeleton is involved in the distribution of plant hormones. Lastly, it addresses the role of endomembrane -cytoskeleton interactions to show the importance of the cytoskeleton in organelle morphogenesis and cellular functions. Studies in various plant models have shown how the actin filament and microtubules control and coordinate plant cell growth and development. This book summarizes the mechanisms underlying these functions. - Digitaledited by Rolf Dermeitzel.Fluorescence proteins and time-lapse imaging of the cytoskeleton / Carsten Theiss and Karl Meller -- Visualizing in vitro trafficking / John W.
