In the 1970s, the academic was in a remote part of India on a research mission when he was struck down with dysentery. 'I was horribly, hideously sick,' he recalls. 'I'd lost 14 kilograms - and I can't afford to lose that much,' adds Kilham, trying in vain to pinch an inch of flesh on his toned torso. In the draining climate of India, Kilham tried Western medicine and other natural remedies but nothing worked. By the time he arrived in the Nepalese capital of Kathmandu, he was barely able to stand. Locals took him to a herbal medicine doctor. 'He gave me an odd-looking powder and pellets which looked like rabbit droppings,' says Kilham. 'I'd been going to the toilet 100 times a day, but that afternoon the symptoms stopped. I was shockingly surprised. It really woke me up.' Since then, Kilham has become the world's most celebrated herbal medicine pioneer. Known as 'the medicine hunter', this Indiana Jones-style adventurer has trekked to the deepest reaches of the Amazon, sailed to remote South Pacific islands, climbed mountains and hacked his way across treacherous terrain into virgin forests. All in search of a healing bark, root, seed, flower or leaf which can be ground down, put in capsules or teas and stacked on shelves in shops of the increasingly health-conscious West. Recently, Kilham was offering a taste of his lifestyle - thrills, pills and bellyaches - to delegates at Asia's first Natural Products Expo held at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. The suits in the audience had all come hoping to find the next cash cow to milk after ginseng, ginkgo and green tea. And Kilham had good news to deliver. 'There are hundreds of next big things waiting to be explored,' he told them. Kilham is as busy as anyone exploring them. He leaves no shrub unturned as he travels the world learning the secrets of good health from sage tribal elders, shamans, mystics, yogis and other healers. The ethnobotany professor from the University of Massachusetts has sourced material for 12 books and even more potions. 'Wherever I go I respect their cultures,' Kilham says. 'I eat the food they eat, sleep where they sleep. If they swim with alligators and piranhas, so do I.' On one trip, natives of a South Pacific island wanted Kilham to walk barefoot along a 15-metre pit of burning stone as part of a sacred ceremony. 'I wasn't too happy about it, but I did it,' he says. In the Amazon rainforest, several tribal leaders asked him to participate in a blowgun contest. 'It came down to me and one chief. In the end he won, which is probably just as well.' Kilham says the few weeks he usually spends in the field is only one aspect of his work. 'It's not sufficient just to run around with a bunch of natives. It's fun but I have to work out the potential [of the remedy] in the market place.' Kilham is more than a hunter. He is hired by companies who want to find, test and develop new or little-known remedies into mass-market products. He works out how the product can be converted to a mass-marketable item and how it can be marketed. In that sense, Kilham sounds more of a medicinal mercenary. But the academic says he sees it as equally important that the native suppliers get a fair deal from his sponsor company. While staying with tribes or impoverished villagers he will offer help, paying to fix a faulty generator or administering herbal remedies to the sick, to demonstrate the relationship is one of give and take. 'In some places I'm an honorary chief and they feed me lobster to show how much they appreciate my efforts,' he says. Nevertheless, exploitation by herbal medicine companies occurs. Even Kilham admits: 'Some projects I have worked on are better than others.' He has turned down jobs he feels fail to match his ethics. Natural health products are big business. Kilham points out that 5.1 billion people - 80 per cent of the world's population - use plant-based medicine and the estimated US$15 billion (HK$117 billion) global market will spiral to US$300 billion within two decades. The scramble for the profits means many trample over indigenous rights, centuries of culture and millions of years of ecological growth. In the mid-1990s, the Kani tribe of India claimed a government institute harvesting arogyappacha fruit to create an energy-giving tonic drink was not compensating local tribespeople. 'The days of exploiting native people are coming to an end,' Kilham says. If companies taking raw materials do not offer a share of royalties and know-how to native growers, lawsuits are likely, he says. 'The days when you could rip people off are gone.' He cites a company that once tried to patent basmati rice, only to be successfully sued by the Indians who have grown it for centuries. Kilham is also aware that even plant cultivation means turning some of the world's most precious greenery into arable land. But the reality of 21st-century economics means the land would otherwise be exploited, probably by logging for timber, if there is no sustainable alternative income available. 'If a plot is worth US$400 for timber, we want them to know it's worth US$1,200 to cultivate nuts and plants,' says Kilham. 'Only trade is going to save the rainforest. It's not leaving it untouched, but it's a better choice.' The employment is more harmonious for native people, he says, 'rather than working in a sweatshop making trainers or footballs'. Kilham grew up in Massachusetts during the 1960's flower-power revolution. Unlike many who dropped out then dropped back in again, he subscribed to the natural lifestyle for good and makes a living out of it. For 30 years, he has practised yoga daily and has used herbs for almost every health need (although he carries a potent antibiotic on trips into the unknown). Approaching 50, his lithe physique and healthy, young complexion are a good advertisement for the remedies he advocates. His daily diet includes green tea and ginseng (although he makes his own ginseng beverages because commercially available ones 'do not contain enough' to give a buzz). He also eats lots of fresh ginger and garlic. 'I upset some companies because I say, 'Why take a capsule when you can make a good marinade with ginger and garlic?''' His life-changing discovery was kava, 'nature's Valium' in the form of a powdered root beverage. He tried it in 1980 at a friend's party. 'My first response was, 'Is this legal?''' Years later he went to the South Pacific to investigate and resolved to bring it to greater public consciousness. 'I don't know why I became the champion of kava,' he says. 'I think the plant enlisted me. Plants can call us.' Kilham also recently published a book, Psyche Delicacies: Coffee, Chocolate, Chillies, Kava And Cannabis - And Why They're Good For You. Perhaps controversially, Kilham says coffee is a good stimulant, while chillies produce endorphin rushes. But he's convinced psychoactive plants are as important as healing ones. His holy grail is getting to Bhutan. 'They have 600 medicinal species and the king is keen on promoting trade. I also want to explore Indonesia, the Philippines and Borneo.' He believes amazing cures remain hidden in nature's foliage. In the 1960s, folic acid was found to have benefits in tackling childhood leukaemia, he says. It has been widely used in medicine since. 'I think there are plants which hold cures for everybody. That's part of the tremendous excitement,' enthuses Kilham. But unlike the many companies he works for, Kilham doesn't want to patent what he discovers. 'I just want to see it developed so it can help many people.' THE NEXT BIG THINGS The medicine hunter's guide to hot herbal solutions Chill pill: Kava is 'legal Valium', according to Chris Kilham. 'It is nature's most beneficial and relaxing plant.' The root is found on islands in the South Pacific and a dried powder form has been mixed into a calming beverage by natives for 3,000 years. Magic mushroom: The reishi mushroom has been hailed as China's king of health foods. Wild claims are made about its benefits, but evidence suggests it fights viruses as virulent as flu and hepatitis A and B, shrinks tumours and is beneficial to those who have undergone chemotherapy. 'The reishi mushroom is going to be a monster,' says Sex aid: Maca, a turnip-like root found in Peru's Andean mountains, is dubbed natural Viagra. 'It's sexually stimulating for both men and women. Athletes also use it to boost performance,' says Kilham. Tests show it increases male libido and sperm count. And unlike most herbal medicines, it tastes good - locals blend it into a liquid aphrodisiac. Skin soother: Tamanu nut oil, or 'green gold' is made from kernels found in Polynesia. Oil is squeezed from tamana nuts to treat skin rashes and disorders. 'Within five years, it'll be in shampoos, creams and ointments,' says Kilham. A derivative compound, calophyllum, may disrupt the HIV virus and at least one company is developing a treatment. Brain booster: Turmeric, or curcumin, is an Indian spice everyone is familiar with. But apart from its culinary usage, its root powder is believed to reduce the incidence of Alzheimer's disease and other degenerative brain diseases, shrink tumours, boost the immune system and is an antioxidant. Libido lifter: The small green shrub zallouh is also known as King Solomon's sex herb. It's been used as a sex potion in Syria and Lebanon for more than 2,000 years, increasing libido and erectile function. To keep your pecker up, a tea made from freeze-dried zallouh should be drunk daily. Energiser: Small berries containing arogyappacha were discovered serendipitously by Indian biologists. While on a trek they became curious as to why their Kani tribe guides in India had so much energy, only to be told it came from small berries the men were munching along the way. The berries were studied in laboratories and a compound called arogyappacha is now used as a pick-me-up. It is effective in combatting fatigue and gives an energy boost, yet contains no caffeine. Chocaholic surprise: Cocoa has long been used to make chocolate, but the bean has hidden powers. It contains polyphenols, which are good for the heart, act as a diet aid and boost the immune system. 'Chocolate-based medicine is on its way,' says Kilham. Aphrodisiac: Yin yang huo, or horny goat weed, fires amorous tendencies in both sexes. Extracts of the leafy plant have been used by the Chinese as a sex potion for two millennia but is now a US$50 million (HK$390 million) industry in the United States. "}
