Of the 60,000 Chinese people who contracted the virus, over 85% were administered herbs, treating symptoms from minor cold and flu to clearing phlegm to treating the pneumonia associated with COVID-19. The tradition of Chinese herbalism is based on two quintessential texts, the Shang Han Lun (Treatise on Cold Damage) and Wen Bing Xue (Warm Disease Theory). Both detail the spread and treatment of pathogens and epidemics, dating back as far as 1065 AD. Each book contains a multitude of formulas, and details the progression of many pathogens. Here we see the blueprint for how diseases like COVID-19 progress, and how we as herbalists can stop this progression. We have formulas to strengthen the immune response, preventing a pathogen from even entering. We have formulas to promote a healthy fever, and help sweat a pathogen out. We have formulas to transform phlegm, treat sore throats, dry coughs, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Undoubtedly, today's Chinese government has an agenda, touting the abilities of traditional Chinese medicine, and proclaiming this body of knowledge as a national treasure, which it is. The government's brazen confidence carries risk. Like all scientific research backed by a vested interest, the research articles coming out of China should be heavily scrutinized. Yet, there are countless physicians employing herbs as a first-line defense because Western medicine has not found an equivalent solution. In fact, pharmaceutical developers are looking toward herbs for inspiration when search for a cure for this disease. I have personally witnessed the healing power of these herbs for a variety of respiratory issues, and firmly stand behind their role in treating the symptoms and quelling the outbreak of COVID-19 in China and here in the United States. The results emerging are not merely coincidental, or purely the product of a political agenda. These ancient remedies serve as an essential piece of a highly integrative medical system in modern China, and we can benefit from their use in our communities, as prophylactic immune support, treating minor respiratory and digestive symptoms, and as adjunct care for pneumonia in serious cases. Please note that all herbal remedies we sell are thoroughly tested for herbicides, pesticides, and heavy metals. We avoid carrying animal products. The information in this post does not substitute for healthcare advice. Below, you will find links to research and other articles detailing the use of herbs in treating COVID-19. Take good care! If we can be of any assistance, please reach out. Remember, the best treatment is prevention.
