If you've never tried it, are just starting out, or even if you practice regularly, you don't want to miss out on this opportunity for a reiki-infused guided meditation with Andrea Groves of Reiki with Andrea. Come and release your dense energies with a shamanic cleanse before delving into a blissful guided meditation that will set your course for balance & harmony on Tuesday, May 10th. Our follow-up class will be held on Thursday, May 19th when we'll use crystals to balance & cleanse your chakras. This second class will require a separate registration, so make sure to reserve your seat for both classes. Both of these balancing & harmonizing classes are so necessary in today's hectic, chaotic, stressful, fast-paced world. Please make time for yourself, and join us! Cups of calming, centering, restorative herbal blends will be served for each participant to sip and enjoy. Please email Andrea for more details and registration requests; andrea.reiki11@gmail.com Class size will be limited to keep this event intimate. Pre-registration is required. "}
