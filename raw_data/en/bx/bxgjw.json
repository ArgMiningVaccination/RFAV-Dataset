The term RMM enco mpasses both therapies unless otherwise specified as outlined in the definitions below . This submission applies the process outlin ed in Attachment B of The Intergovernme ntal Agreement for a National Registration and Accreditation Scheme for the Heal th Professions (IGA) , which outlin es six criteria to be met before registration of any health profession is considered.2 The IGA states 'it was envisaged that other health pro fessions would be added over time.'3 This submission will focus on all of these cri teria with a special focus on Criterion 2 which requires that the occupations' practice presents a serious risk to public health and safety which co uld be minimised by regul ation. This submission seeks to demo nstrate that registration of this health profession is justified and will provide evidence of the risk to public health and safe ty that may arise for RMM and the reasons why current regulator y mechanisms are insufficient in minimi sing this risk. Risks associated with clinical judgments are inherent in any health profession. This submission will outline some of the documented examples of any type of injury that has been reported to have occurred in relation to RMM in Aust ralia and Canada. In achieving that goal , this submission will be cogni sant of the COAG Best Practice Regulation Guidelines (COAG guidelines)4 which requires any regula tory response to first find a case for a ction , any decisions made should consider self-regulation, co -regulation and non -regulatory options and it should provide the greatest ne t benefit for the community which is proportional to the issue being addresse d.5 Although this submission is primarily focussed on the Australian context , information has been accessed from other jurisdictions such as the USA and Canada . The use of international evidence is justified on the basis that the types of therapies used in RMM in Australia are also applied in these other jurisdictions and evidence of harm repo rted in those jurisdictions provides lessons about the potential risk s in the provision of RMM in Australia and insights into the optimal regulatory structure that could apply in Australia .

Criterion 2: Do the activities of the occupation pose a significant risk of harm to the health and safety of the public? Criterion 3: Do existing regulatory or other mechanisms fail to address health and safety issues? Criterion 4: Is regulation possible to implement for the occupation in question? Criterion 5: Is regulation practical to implement for the occupation in question? Criterion 6: Do the benefits to the public of regulation clearly outweigh the potential negative impact of such regulation? 3 The Intergovernmental Agreement for a National Registration and Accreditation Scheme for the Health Professions (26 March 2008), p 22, 1.1 4 Council of Australian Governments, Best Practice Regulation Guidelines: A Guide for Ministeri al Councils and National Standard Setting Bodies , October 2007. 5 Ibid 4-6. 4 Remedial Massage has been defined as: 'i) the application of a range of diagnostic techniques to identify clients and their conditions as suitable for remedial massage therapy and to enable adaption of remedial massage therapy techniques to suit the n eeds of individual clients; and ii) the use of a range of basic and advanced massage techniques (e.g. Trigger points, myofascial release and lymphatic drainage) to treat a variety of musculoskeletal and other system conditions .'6 Myotherapy 'A Myotherapist is a health practitioner specialising in the assessment, treatment and prevention of specific musculoskeletal conditions and somatic dysfunction. Treatment may involve various modalities that enhance the restoration and recovery from these conditions via treatment of soft tissues. For example; muscle, fascia and associated structure. Myotherapy is a manual therapy with a scope of practice aimed at treating and managing the soft tissues of the body. Soft tissues include muscular and connective tissues and t heir within and between system interactions. A Myotherapist uses underpinning knowledge of anatomy, physiology, kinesiology, biomechanics and pathology to understand the relationships between the myofascia (muscles and related connective tissues), but also how the muscles and connective tissues relate to other systems of the body. Myotherapists use clinical examination skills, to locate the sources of symptoms and identify dysfunctions. They also use high level communication, clinical reasoning, problem sol ving and planning skills to design and implement treatment and management programs. Where symptoms or dysfunctions exist, treatment aims to normalise sensation and function. Additionally, where no symptoms exist, management aims to optimise function, postu re and movement. Normalising includes assisting the relief of pain and the return of normal sensation, posture and movement. The Myotherapist can function as the first point of treatment with an expert knowledge of the function and dysfunction of the soft tissue of the body in relation to movement. The Myotherapist can also function as a specialised member within an interdependent multi - disciplinary team of health professionals.'7 Sports injury management, nutrition, exercise therapy and rehabilitation add a broader scope to learning and career outcomes at AQF Level 7 (bachelor degree).8 Criterion 1: Is it appropriate for Health Ministers to exercise responsibility for regulating the occupation in question, or does the occupation more appropriately fall with in the domain of another Ministry? Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM)9, a sizeable part of which would involve expenditure on RMM , now constitutes a significant part of the Australian health care sector. A 2007 study suggested that the estimate d number of patient visits to CAM practitioners is similar to the number of visits to conventional medical providers (69.2 million v. 69.3 million) with national out - 6 Grace S & Deal M, Textbook of remedial massage , (2012) Elsevier Australia 1-2. 7 22316 VIC Advanced Diploma of Myotherapy 1 January Myotherapy , (2nd edit 1996) RMIT Publishing 44-46. 9 The World Hea lth Organization (WHO) defines CAM as a \"broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition and are not integrated into the dominant health system\" http://who.int/medicines/areas/traditional/definitions/en/ 5 of-pocket expenditure s on CAM products of over $4.1 billion .10 In some areas of Australia, CAM practitioners providing primary care services out number conventional primary care physicians .11 Accordingly , it is important that , along with orthodox medicine , the regulation of CAM is given careful consideration. As the use of CAM is a multi -billion -dollar industry in Australia and is providing a substantial level of health services to Australians alongside orthodox medicine , it is appropriate for Health Ministers to exercise responsibility for the se occupation s rather than the occupations being regul ated by another Ministry. If the IGA is appropriately within the portfolio of the Health Ministers , then there is no reason why the re gulation of t hese occupation s should fall within any other Ministry domain . While t he number of RMM practitioners in Austr alia is not clear , there are in excess of 11,8 00 therapeutic massage therapists in Australia and perhaps approximately 15,100 practitioners by 2020 based upon government statistics .12 Although the type of therapies, substances and health philosophy applied in the provision of RMM may be different from orthodox medicine , the focus is upon client health and it is appropriate that Health Ministers consider regulation of the se occupation s. Criterion 2: Do the activities of the occupation pose a significant ris k of harm to the health and safety of the public? The following should be considered when assessing whether there is significant risk of harm to the health and safety of the public: the nature and severity of the risk to the client group; the nature a nd severity of the risk to the wider public; and the nature and severity of the risk to the practitioner. Areas which could be explored to identify a risk to public health and safety are: to what extent does the practice of the occupation involve the u se of equipment, materials or processes which could cause a serious threat to public health and safety; to what extent may the failure of a practitioner to practice in particular ways (that is, follow certain procedures, observe certain standards, or atte nd to certain matters), result in a serious threat to public health and safety; are intrusive techniques used in the practice of the occupation, which can cause a serious, or life-threatening danger; to what extent are certain substances used in the prac tice of the occupation, with particular emphasis on pharmacological compounds, dangerous chemicals or radioactive substances; and is there significant potential for practitioners to cause damage to the environment or to cause substantial public health and safety risk. 10 Charlie C Xue et al, 'Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use in Australia: A National Population -Based Survey' (2007) 13 (6) Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine 643, 643. 11 Jon Wardle et al, 'Distribution of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM ) Providers in Rural New South Wales, Australia: A Step towards Explaining High CAM Use in Rural Health?'

Rese arch literature suggests that RMM is generally safe but mild to very s erious adverse events have been docu mented.13 This submission will document both the reports of adverse events and the discussion of the frequency and nature of those adverse events which suggests the need to consider statutory regulation for RMM practitioners to ensure that the e ducation, tr aining and probity of RMM practitioners is such as to reduce those negative outcomes. In addition , this submission will discuss some of the risks for clients based upon the association that historically and currently exists between the sex industry and RMM . This association and the reliance upon self -regulation for the professional has resulted in the provision of RMM by unqualified practitioners with potential risks for clients . Statutory regulation will greatly assist in excluding those who do no t have a professional focus through not permitting their use of restricted titles and provide a market signal of safe practice.14 The association between RMM and the sex industry and the regrettable record of sexual assault and rape of clients of some RMM practition ers should be seen as adverse events in terms of the impact o n clients of RMM practitioners. Inagraham suggest s that massage therapy is generally safe but RMM can:15 'Directly cause new injuries - most are minor but not all Aggravate existing injuries and chronic pain problems Distract patients from more appropriate care Mildly stress the nervous system ' A leading CAM researcher Professor Ernst has documented examples of adverse events ( AEs) associated with RMM .16 In significant detailed research Ernst noted the low number of AEs and the safety of RMM but noted this could be based upon under -reporting and noted that in a related area (spinal manipulation) the under -reporting wa s very high .17 Ernst's article documented 20 examples of significant adverse events associated with RMM involving outcomes such as a ruptured uterus, pulmonary embolism, ulceration of the leg and infection leading to amputation of the leg, hematoma, pseudoaneurysm of the popliteal artery requiring arterial reconstruction, colon rupture a nd deterioration of hearing.18 Other example s where remedial massage was seen to imp act on patients included .19 Neck massage causing a number of cases of acute deterioration of hearing20 Vigorous massage of left calf for 10 minutes leading to pulmonary emb olus Vigorous massage for acute swelling over left back leading to haematoma related also to warfarin 13 E Ernst, 'The Safety of Massage Therapy ', (2003) 42 Rhematology , 110 1-1106; Paul Ingraham, 'Poisoned by Massage in, What could possible go wrong with Massage ', Pain Science dotcom , http://www.painscience.com/articles/whats - the-harm.php,1 ; K Kraft , S .

Ernst not ed 'that massage by non -professional and forceful techniques like shiatsu, urut, and Rolfing are relatively often associated with adverse events.'22 Ernst concluded that 'massage therapies are not totally devoid of risks. The incidence of adverse events is unknown but probably low.23' Ernst and Posadzki provided an update to Ernst's 2003 article in 2013.24 This review identified a further 17 examples of AE s associated with RMM including acute paraplegia, abdominal distension, bladder rupture and bilateral cer ebellar infarction. The majority of the AEs were not associated with qualified therapeutic massage suggesting that attention to training and qualified practitioners may be a means to avoid many AEs.25 It was noted that electric massage devices were respons ible for many AE's. Some details about the AEs includes: After a vigorous neck massage by a professional masseur a 19 -year-old man presented with a left supracla vicular mass causing an injury of the thoracic duct leading to a leakage of lymph. Treatment led to a complete recovery.26 A 53 -year-old woman presented with a worsening shortness of breath having received a vigorous calf massage at a beauty salon. At the end of that session, she experienced pain for 2 weeks and shortness of breath. A deep venous t hrombosis in the left leg and extensive acute pulmonary emboli was diagnosed. Treatment led to almost complete recovery. A 47 -year-old man had a history of numbness in all fingers and bilateral paraesthesias and carpal tunnel syndrome received 2 months of in-patient rehabilitation therapy followed by massage at a private massage clinic. The massage therapist applied passive range -of-motion exercises to his arms, followed by compression of the anterior thorax and neck. The man then experienced acute weaknes s of all limbs. Clinical examination showed bilateral motor weaknesses, sensory impairment, generalised hyperreflexia and disc herniation due to compressive myelopathy. After treatment a significant deficit in hand function and gait coordination persisted.27 Fifty - year- old woman received face massage including left rotation of the head, placed shin on woman's shoulder and posterior to anterior pressure against forehead with that repeated on the right side. Sharp pain in left side revealed to be caused by d issection of carotid and vertebral arteries. 21 Kalinga MJ, LO Tan 'Popliteal pseudoaneurysm caused by an osteochondroma traditional medic ine sequelae ', (1996) 37 Singapore Med J , 443-445. 22 Ernst above n 13 , 1105, Paul Ingraham, 'Poisoned by Massage in What could possible go wrong with Massage ', Pain Science dotcom, http://www.painscience.com/articles/whats -the-harm.php. 23 Ernst , above n 13 , 1105 . 24 P Posadzki and E Ernst, 'The Safety of Massage Therapy: An Update of a systematic Review ', (2013) (1) 18, Focus on Alternative and Complementary Therapies , 27-32. 25 Ibid 32 26 Ibid 28 27 Ibid 29 8 Patient with history of polycystic kidney disease, coronary heart disease, and other conditions received vigorous massage in a massage chair leading to subcapsular haematoma.28 Ernst and Posadzki describe e xampl es of use of mechanical electric massage device leading to left sided hemiparesis leading to right extracranial internal carotid artery an d large ischaemic stroke in middle cerebral artery.29 There is evidence that the practice of RMM requires training in regard to the impact of medications on clients to avoid potential adverse events caused its impact on the metabolism of the client . This can occur in situations where :30 a client is taking analgesics or depressants which may result in the client not providi ng accurate feedback about the im pact of massage therapy as the medications may alter their pain response. This could result in a client consenting to deeper massage potentially causing more tissue damage or bruising.31 Massage around injection sites, sk in patches and implanted devices may potentially alter the pharmacokinetics of the drug being administered. Massage may increase blood glucose and could trigger a hypoglycemic epidsode.32 Potential AE s have been identified with massage for clients undergoi ng chemotherapy, HIV or AIDS treatment and antipsychotics.33 Massage therapy is also contraindicated for some pregnant women, persons with bleeding disorders or low blood platelets and forceful and deep tissue massage should be avoided or where there is evidence of a tumour or cancer.34 Inagraham has discussed a number of examples of AE's with RMM .35 After a strong two-hour session of massage therapy an 88-year old man collapsed caused by too much myoglobin in his blood causing kidney problems . Likely caused by massage .36 Report of a spinal acces sory nerve injury being a case of spinal acces sory neuropathy associated with deep tissue massage leading to scapular winging [the shoulder blade sticking out] and droopy shoulder as a result of we akness of the tr apezius muscle.37 Apparent b rain artery damage (extracranial internal car otid artery dissection ) involving a 38- year-old woman who gave herself a stroke after use of a vibrating massage tool on her neck.38 Evidence a m assage can dislodge blood clots, impacti ng on the lungs, brain or other tissues .

A 20 -year-old hockey player was subjected to an acute blow to the lateral thigh. The player was inappropriately treated with deep -tissue massage and heat at the time of injury. It is believed that this led to the fulmination and advanced degree of MOT development. Immobilization allowed for resorption of the calcific density of the ossified structure. Conclusion: Proper care of acute trauma is essential in di sorders of this nature.

This particularly applies when RMM is provided by untrained persons who do not understand the risks of RMM , the means t o balance risks with benefits and the boundaries of competent practice to avoid negative outcomes. Many of these AEs may be avoided by standard professional practices relying on proper training and education. Currently there is limited control over entry i n the RMM profession and few indications of quality for this profession. Connection with sex industry One of the difficult issues which have arisen for the RMM profession is the unfortunate connection that exists between it and the sex industry .60 Most m assage therapy students enter professional 53 Trotter JF, 'Hepatic hematoma after deep tissue massage ', (1999) 341 The New England Journal of Medicine , 2019 - 2020. 54 Yeo TC, Choo MH, Tay MB, 'Massive haematoma from digital massage in an antico agulated patient: a ca se report,' (1994) 35 Singapore Journal , 319 -320 55 Kalinga MJ, Lo NN, Tan Sk, 'Popliteal Artery pseudoaneurysm caused by an osteochondroma - a traditional medicine massage, ' (1996) 37(4) Singapore Med J, 443-445. 56 Ping Yin Xu , 'Adverse Events of Massage Therapy in Pain - Related Conditions: A Systematic Review ', (2014) Evidence -Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine . https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2014/480956/ 57 J.

In that sense 'therapeutic massage occupies a unique position as against other hands -on bodywork therapies.'62 This has created a difficult and frustrating environment for the process of profe ssionalization of RMM . In an environment where any person is entitled to hold thems elves out as a massage therapist there has been little control over entry to the profession. This has been exacerbated by the nature of the practice of RMM . RMM will normally involve a practitioner in a secluded, relatively unsupervised and private place o ften with the client alone with the practitioner. The client will normally be supine in a state of undress other than underwear .63 The massage will normally involve the massage of most of the body other than breast tissue and genital areas. There is nothin g illegal in massaging the breast and genital area , but this is an act which would require the clear consent of the client. In a professional context this issue should normally not arise as codes of conduct for some RMM professional associations provide ma ssage of these areas is not permitted64 or there are specific consent protocol s for that practice.65 This submission suggests that based upon the nature of the profession and the lack of control over entry into the profession members of the public who seek the services of a person who holds him or herself out as a massage therapist may not be aware that this person many have little understanding or commitm ent to ethical professional practice . Absent some form of statutory regulation it is very difficult for a consumer to differentiate between those with or without training or a professional perspective practicing within an effective disciplinary regime . This may result in some consumers experiencing negative outcomes which any 'after the fact ' regulation such as a Code of Conduct , whether statutory or not, cannot make good. In addition , one aspect of good professional practice is a very careful description of what is intended to be done as part of the massage treatment including whether buttocks are included. For some massage therapists (most of which are either not trained at all or are trained at a low level) the combination of these circumstances has led to concerning cases of inappropriate and criminal behaviour . Refer to Schedule A . These incidents have led to charges, convictions, complaints and prohibition orders discussed below dealing with sexual assault and rape during the provision of RMM . The RMM professional associations have been awake to this issue and some professional associations apply profes sional level educational standards for membership such as a diploma or degree standard , CPE training dealing with matters relevant to this issue, specif y the parts of the body a RMM therapist must not touch and have promulgated codes of practice and conduc t. The control of such behaviour is currently regulated through: Criminal law proceedings for sexual assault or rape which may have deterrence impacts. Professional Association discipline which may lead to expulsion though the practitioners may seek membe rship with another professional association. Loss of access to Health fund rebates for those who had such access though untrained practitioners would not have such access in any event. Health Complaints actions after a complaint by a consumer potentially l eading to an interim or permanent prohibition order in NSW, Qld, Victoria and SA (soon to be nationwide). 61 Paul Finch, 'The motivation of massage therapy students to enter profes sional education ', 26 (8) Medical Teacher 729-731. 62 Sarah Oerton, 'Bodywork Boundaries: Power, Politics and Professionalism in Therapeutic Massage ', (2004) 11 Gender Work and Organization 543-565. 63 Ibid 550. -of-practice -final.pdf 12 All of the above measures have value but they apply only 'after the event' in retrospect after an act has already caused physical and mental anguish t o the client. The purpose of this submission to argue for a greater level of security for clients of RMM clients through statutory regulation to provide a more robust regulatory environment for the public benefit . Statutory regulation will have the benefi t of high level educational requirements for registration; probity and background assessment; clear statutory codes of conduct and a statutorily backed disciplinary process and importantly a limitation on the use of a restricted titles . If a restric ted ti tle such as 'Remedial Massage therapist,' 'Myotherapist' or other s imilar title was restricted this will not permit 'holding out' by non -registrants and will deal with the consequences of negligent practice and unprofessional practices by untrained RMM practitioners. Below are a number of prohibition orders issued by both the Queensland Office of Health Ombudsman and the New South Wales Health Care Complaints Commission in recent years relevant to the practice of RMM .

Complaints to Health Complaints Bodies The level of complaints abou t health issues may provide a profile of the risk of particular therapies and the activities of specific practitioners. There are health complaint bodies in all States and Territories in Australia which compile and publish health complaint statistics.69 The La Trobe report looked at examples of complaints against alternative medicine practitioners to Health Complaints Commissioner s in a number of jurisdictions over the perio d for the period 1997 -2004.70 The ACT, Tasmania and the Northern Territory health complaints body made no mention of alternative or other providers in its statistics . The difficulty with the evidence provided by health complaints bodies for the purpose of an alysing the complaint profile for RMM was that in most cases little detail was provided about the modalities complained against with most categorised under the term 'alternative health providers, alternative therapists, alternative health, alternative prov iders or other providers '. More recently , the New South Wales Health Care Complaints Commission Annual Report 2013 - 2014 contained records of 17 complaints against massage therapists associated with issues relevant primarily to professional conduct (8) and treatment (5).71 Of those complaints three were investigated by the Commission and two were referred to another body. Recent data provided by the New South Wales Health Care Complain ts Commission Annual Report 2015 -2016 contained records of complaints ag ainst RMM from 2011 -2012 to 2015 -2016 sho wing 27 complaints.72 Criterion 2, Conclusion Based upon the level of demonstrated serious risk that applies for the practice of RMM ; the co ncerns about the current freedom for uneducated RMM practitioners to pra ctice relatively freely ; the inability for consumers to readily ascertain which practitioner has the requisite education and training ; and the fact that RMM practitioners may practice as primary health practitioners is suggestive of the need to provide gre ater regulatory control over this profession . Criterion 3: Do existing regulatory or other mechanisms fail to address health and safety issues? Once the particular health and safety issues have been identified, they are addressed through: other regula tions, for example, risk due to skin penetration addressed via regulations governing skin penetration and/or the regulation of the use of certain equipment, or industrial awards; supervision by registered practitioners of a related occupation; and self-regulation by the occupation . 69 Healthcare Complaints Act 1993 (NSW); Health Complaints Act 2016 (Vic.); Health Ombudsman Act 2013 (Qld); Health and Disabil ity Services (Complaints) Act 1995 (WA); Health Complaints Act 1995 (Tas); Health and Community Services Complaints Act 2004 (SA); Human Rights Commission Act 2005 (ACT); Health and Community Services Complaints Act 1998 (NT). 70 La Trobe University Report , The Practice and Regulatory Requirements of Naturopathy and Western Herbal Medicine November 2005 (School of Public Health - La Trobe University), V Lin, A Bensoussan, S P Myers, P McCabe, M Cohen, Sophie Hill and G Howse . http://health.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/320188/naturopathy -final1106.pdf , 35. 71 New South Wales, Health Care Complaints Commission Annual Report 2013 -2014, 123. 72 Ibid 15 The health and safety risks of the provision of RMM are documented above and include the reported adverse outcomes reflected in court decisions documented in Schedule A . These health and safety risks have resulted in some case s in very serious health outcomes . Current professional regu lation of RMM is primarily based upon self-regulation which is inadequate to deal with the risks of RMM .73 The regulation of RMM involves both the application of general legislative provisions deal ing with the activities of any health professional (such as the Australian Consumer Law) and some legislation which deals with more specific issues for RMM such as negative licensing provisions discussed below . The primary regulation of RMM involves self -regulation through membership of a professional associatio n. Self-Regulation The current regulatory framework is fragmented and lacks a level of coherence available through statutory regulation. There is little control on entry into the profession or pr acticing RMM in Australia .74 Even if a RMM practitioner is not a member of a specific professional association because (a) the practitioner does not comply with required educ ational standards or (b) for financial reasons or (c) their membership is withdrawn after disciplinary action leading to expulsion , that person can either seek membership with another profes sional association or continue their practice with some limitations . A person stating that they are a RMM practitioner or a former professional assoc iation member, deregistered health therapists such as chiropractors, osteopaths or TCM practitioners cann ot be prevented from holding out they are RMM practitioners .75 This applies unless the practitioner acts in a mann er that breaches consumer legislation such as indicating they have qualif ications or membership they do not have resulting in a court order requiring cessation of that activity or the practitioner is subject to a prohibition order under a negative licensing regime . Many breaches may not be de tected by regulators who are averse to commencing regulatory action except in cases of clear breaches .76 This suggests that these practitioners cannot be effectively policed in the current self -regulatory setting. Under self -regulation , professional ass ociations normally establish standards of practice. Numerous professional associations represent RMM practitioners each with its own standards of practice, minimum educational qualifications for entry and disciplinary procedures. This results in industry standards that are piecemeal and inconsistent and disciplinary procedures that lack transparency and consistency .77 Smaller professional association s have resisted amalgamation into larger professional associations to allow an orderly movement to professiona l status . This has resulted in a plethora of inconsistent standards of practice and education and a lack of expertise in developing a tr anspa rent, consistent, rigorous and fair mechanism for complaints and investigation with appropriate avenues of appeal. The size of some professional associations means the complaint processes may not be properly funded .78 Market pressures to attract membership by professional associations may result in lower standards and differences in standards and may have been a reason for the fragmentation of 73 Above n 70, 295-296. 74 Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council, Final Report, Options for Regulation of Unregistered Health Practitioners , April 2013, 28. 75 J Wardle, A Steel and J Adams, 'A Review of Tensions and Risks in Naturopathic Education and Tr aining in Australia: A Need for Regulation,' (2012) 18 (4) The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine 363, 364. 76 https://www.tga.gov.au/regulatory -compliance -framework 77 Wardle, above n 75 , 364; Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council, Fin al Report, Options for Regulation of Unregistered Health Practitioners , April 2013, 17. 78 Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council, Final Report, Options for Regulation of Unregistered Health Practitioners , April 2013, 54. 16 professional associations exacerbatin g differentiation in standards.79 Further, internal divisions within the professions tend to exacerbate these issues.80 Consumer Legislation It is worthwhile to consider some of the legislati ve provisions which specifically or generally regulate RMM in Australia. The current legislative framework that exists in Australia as it applies to the practice of RMM is deficient . This regulatory structure as outlined below provides regulation under consumer legislation, health complaints legislation and negative licensing. The integrity of this regulatory structure relies to a great extent on the professional standards of the RMM practitioners who are required to satisfy these legislative standards. Fo r many RMM practitioners the responsibility provided by self -regulation and the legislative framework is accepted but the capacity to control level of education, training and probity of practitioners would be enhanced by a more a formal process of regulati on. Like any business, RMM practitioners in Australia are subject to consumer legislation that imposes obligations on the practitioner as to how goods and services are advertised and supplied. T he most important statutes are the Sale of Goods Act (SGA) (almost identical provisions in all States)81 and the Commonwealth Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (CCA) (similar provisions applicable in all States).82The CCA includes the Australian Consumer Law (ACL), which applies across all jurisdictions in Australia . Many RMM practitioners sell goods such as oils and massage equipment . These sales are also subject to t he SGA . The SGA deals with transactions relating to 'goods' on matters such as how a contract of sale is formed , impli ed warranties as to quality, undertaking as to title, when title to the goods pass and how the performance of the contract should occur. Goods are defined to include most items and substances sold by RMM practitioners. Misleading or deceptive behaviour The ACL provides that :83 'A person s hall not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive.' This is a very broad provision that covers many specific circumstances dealt with under other sections. A breach of this provision might include exaggerated claims of the effect of services, such as miracle slimming techniques where the claims are not verifiable. Another example is unjustified claims made about the curative effects of certain massage procedures sold by practitioners. Uncon scionable conduct A person is obliged not to take advantage of a vulnerable client .84 This is fundamental to appropriate professional practice and is reflected in the ACL provision that 'a supplier shall not, in trade or commerce, in connection with the sup ply or possible supply of goods or services to a person (\"the customer\"), engage in conduct that is, in all the circumstances, unconscionable'. The provision describes examples of unconscionable conduct such as the use of unequal bargaining power or where undue influence or unfair tactics were used in connection with the supply of goods or services. Liability might arise if a client under a disability, such as inexperience or limited English or understanding, was convinced to undertake a course of treatment or to purchase goods in circumstances where the practitioner used his or her position as a health professional to unfairly 79 Wardle, above n 75 , 364, 36 5. 80 Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council, Final Report, Options for Regulation of Unregistered Health Practitioners , April 2013, 54. 81 Weir, Law and Ethics in Complementary Medicine (5th edit, 2016) Allen and Unwin 191 -193. 82 Ibid 194 -196 83 Ibid Australian Consumer Law s 18. 84 Ibid 195 Australian Consumer Law s 20. 17 influence this transaction. False representations Goods and services should be marketed fairly without misrepresentation .85 The ACL p rovides that a person shall not, in trade or commerce in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services or in connection with the promotion by any means of the supply or use of goods or services, make representations such as: falsely r epresenting that goods are of a particular standard, quality, value, grade, composition, style or model or have had a particular history or particular previous use ; falsely representing that services are of a particular standard, quality, value or grade ; falsely representing that goods or services have sponsorship, approval, performance characteristics, accessories, uses or benefits they do not have ; and making a false or misleading representation concerning the need for any goods or services. In New South Wales, s 99 of the Public Health Act 2010 penalises the promotion or advertisement of health services (this includes complementary medicine) which is false, misleading or deceptive, or likely to be misleading or deceptive. In addition, this provision pena lises promotion or advertisement of health services that creates an unjustified expectation of beneficial treatment . The limitation of this form of regulation is that financial injury might arise for a consumer from dealing with a practitioner who unbekn ownst to the consumer is acting in a misleading or deceptive manner or any physical injury occurs before the breach of consumer legislation is established. Although a remedy for a breach of these provisions may be available through the relevant regulator the Australian Competition and Consumer (ACCC ) or other state consumer bodies , obtaining that remedy will be time consuming and perhaps expensive for consumers. It has been suggested that 'while consumer protection regulators have successfully prosecuted in some cases, results are mixed and relying on consumer protection legislation to deal with repeated and wilful unethical conduct of unregistered health practitioners may be insufficient to protect public health and safety.'86 Health Complaints Health Complaints Commissioners in Australia's States and Territories can receive complaints about the professiona l conduct of RMM practitioners.87 This legislation focuses on investigation, conciliation and the resolution of disputes .88 The avenues for disciplinary ac tion against unregistered practitioners are few, particularly if practitioners are not receptive to conciliation. Subject to the discussion of negative licencing applied in some jurisdiction s including prohibition orders in some cases the ability to enforc e standards of treatment under this legislation is limited because there are no sanctions available for unregistered professions unless there are grounds for referral to the police for criminal matters or by civil litigation . The embarrassment and inconven ience of a complaint made against a practitioner may not always be sufficient to improve their performance . 85 Ibid 195 -196, Australian Consumer Law s 29. 86 Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council, Final Report, Options for Regulation of Unregistered Health Practitioners , April 2013, 52. 87 Health Care Complaints Act 1993 (NSW); Health Complaints Act 2016 (Vic.); Health Ombudsman Act 2013 (Qld); Health and Disability Services (Complaints) Act 1995 (WA); Health Complaints Act 1995 (Tas); Health and Community Services Complaints Act 2004 (SA); Human Rights Commission Act 2005 (ACT); Health and Community Services Complaints Act 1998 (NT). 88 Health Complaints Act 2016 (Vic) s154, Healthcare Ombudsman Act 2013 (Qld) s 288 and Regulation 5. 18 Negative Licensing Concern has been expressed in Australia with regard to the activities of some unregistered health professionals, including fo rmerly registered health professionals who now practise in related fields after being suspended or deregistered. The discipline and enforcement provisions available under registration statutes are not available to stop some unfair, unethical, criminal and dangerous practices by a small proportion of unregistered health practitioners.89 This gap in the legislation and a number of concerning cases of unethical and dangerous acts by unregistered health practitioners led to New South Wales and later South Austra lia enacting a Code of Conduct for unregistered health practitioners to regulate the activities of those health workers giving powers to grant prohibition orders against their activities.90 These Codes of Conduct are a form of 'negative licensing' which m eans there are limited controls on entry into the profession, but they provide a power to prohibit a person to practice in some practice areas or prohibit practice entirely based upon a breach of the relevant code. A review of this issue by the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council culminated in a decision by the COAG Health Council in April 2015 for a code of conduct for health workers (similar but not the same) as the New South Wales example to be enacted in all jurisdictions in Australia.91 The im plementation of this proce ss may take some time to unfold. When fully reali sed this process will mean that regulation similar to the New South Wales model will apply across Australia . This regulation will include the significant remedies to apply interim o r permanent prohibition orders against the practices of unregistered practitioners who are in breach of the Code of Conduct. Queensland has already enacted the National Code of Conduct for Health Care Workers (Queensland) reflecting the national model unde r Regulation 5 of the Health Ombudsman Regulation 2014 as has Victoria under the Health Complaints Act 2016 (Vic) Schedule 2. The use of this form of regul ation is welcome but it provides retrospective regulation that applies only after negative outcomes h ave arisen and does not provide proactive prior statutory regulation of the quality of training, education and probity of RMM practitioners. Fragmented Regulatory Framework The practice of RMM is framed by a myriad of incoherent complex and confusing legislation and regulations at both State and Federal levels. These legi slative and regulatory measures are based upon different policy imperatives which are significant in their own right such as health care complaints but it is not easy to point to a clear regulatory structure for the practice of RMM . Consideration of overseas regulatory models such as that applying in the USA and Canada is relevant to Australian policy development.92 The protection of the consumers is best attained through the development o f a register of practitioners, based upon specified standards of practitioner probity and professional practice, education and training. This will assist in prospectively avoid ing adverse outcomes , but if they occur , to provide a statutory mechanism for in vestigating allegations of unprofessional conduct to provide a resp onse to ensure the practitioner does not repeat that behaviour 89 J Wardle, 'The National Registration and Accreditation S cheme: what would inclusion mean for naturopathy and Western herbal medicine', (2010) 22(4) Australian Journal of Medical Herbalism 114. 90http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/phact/Documents/Code_of_Conduct_unregistered_health_practitioners_ -_poster_ - _2012_Regulat ion.pdf 91 Refer to the COAG, Final Report: A National Code of Conduct for Health Care workers (17 April 2015) in relation to the details of this proposed National Code of Conduct. http://www.coaghealthcouncil.gov.au/Announcements/ArtMID/527/ArticleID/54/Final -Report -A-National Code -of- Conduct -for-health -care -workers) 92 Refer to discussion below at page 35 -38. 19 and to provide lessons that can be applied generally in the regulatory structure. This is what currently applies under the Nat ional Law in Australia for health professions subject to statutory regulation. Criterion 4: Is regulation practical to implement for the occupation in question? When considering whether regulation of the occupation is possible, the following needs to b e considered: is the occupation well defined; does the occupation have a body of knowledge that can form the basis of its standards of practice; is this body of knowledge, with the skills and abilities necessary to apply the knowledge, teachable and te stable; where applicable, have functional competencies been defined; and do the members of the occupation require core and government accredited qualifications? RMM Workforce There is a reasonable level of information about the nature of the RMM workf orce in Australia dealing with the size of the profession, the relationship with orthodox medicine and the role that RMM takes in the provision of health services in Australia. A 2015 study suggests that massage therapy is amongst the most commonly used fo rms of CAM in Australia and there is a high rate of referrals to RMM practitioners by medical doctors.93 The significance of the role of RMM is indicated by the ABS Census from 2006 which suggested that there were 8,199 persons who report RMM as their prima ry source of income in Australia.94 This would not identify those CAM practitioners who use RMM as an adjunct of another modality. The workforce size was expected to reach a sum of 15,100 by 2020 according to government sources.95 These statistics may undere stimate the number of practitioners as professional associations representing RMM represent over 15,000 practitioners though this may relate to dual memberships or membership by persons who are not actually practicing.96 Statistics suggest that there are mo re MT practitioners in Australia then chiropractors and naturopaths.97 The utilization of RMM is not entirely clear as data is not available98 but there is evidence from one study that 20% of Australians had a consultation with a RMM practitioner in the fol lowing year.99 In addition there is a high degree of utilization of RMM for specified health purposes such as pregnancy issues and back pain.100 93 J Wardle, R Barnett and Jon Adam s, 'Practice and Research in Australian Massage Therapy: A national workforce survey ' (2015) 8 International Journal of Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork 2-10 at 2. 94 Department of Health.

Nearly one half of the GPs surveyed considered it appropriate for G Ps to practice RMM and that it would be appropriate for this be funded by Medicare.102 Massage therapists may not necessarily practice as a primary health provider103 however it is likely that on many occasions the RMM practitioner will be a primary health p rovider for the types of maladies considered to be relevant to RMM such as musculoskeletal conditions. The role of RMM is said to be a conjunctive rather than a competitive role for RMM in terms of other health practitioners.104 RMM is normally focused on s pecific health issues rather than maintenance of general health problems In regard to the focus on the research Wardle suggests that CAM including RMM needs to focus on research to provide an accepted evidence base and evidenced based practice.105 A focus o n research about RMM has been shown to positively affect the clinical skills of a RMM practitioner and assist in the progress of the profession though there is limited research about the connection between the RMM profession and research.106 ANTA provides to its RMM members free access to scientific resources including ESBCO Host, eMIMS, IMgateway and iTherapeutics and two major RMM professional associations focussed on RMM have prepared portfolios outlining published research about efficacy of MT. Refer to d iscussion below. In regard the profile of the RMM profession research reveals a number of significant statistics about the profile of the MT profession: Gender - Approximately 2/3 of the workforce is female107 which matches generally the ABS Job Outlook sta tistics which suggest 65% were female.108 Time in practice - 58% had been in practice for more than 5 years and nearly 30% in practice for more than 10 years Employment load - 14.6% working full time ie 30 hours a week or more with the balance on part time work. Employment status - 81.7% were self -employed. Place of training - 98% were trained in Australia with 45% having a qualification pre -dating the 2002 national competency standards Income - 5.7% suggested their income was over $50,000. More than one hal f (55%) of the massage therapists indicated RMM was their sole source of income. 101 Wardle, above n 93, 3.

Private Health insurer use - 30.9% reported that over 70% of clients accessed a claim for private health insurance. Continuing Professional Education (CPE) - 43.3% Reported regularly exceeding their CPE quota. Access to research - 56.1% relied upon relied on professional association to keep up to date for research while 39.2% also accessed articles online and in journals. Level of Education - The ABS Job Outlook statistics suggest that 17.8 % of massage therapists hold a bachelor degree;109 58.9% hold an advanced diploma or diploma 110 and 23.3% hold a certificat e.111 As myotherapy and musculoskeletal degrees become more common it is likely the percentage of practitioners with degree level qualifications will increase. The statistics compiled by Leach provide further statistical information. 112 According to Leach 's statistics RMM in Australia had the most numbers of practitioners per head of population at 1:2424 as against other CAM practitioners.113 Level and Nature of Education of RMM The current educational standard for RMM reflect s a health profe ssion in transit ion to a higher level of professionalization and educational standards beyond certificate level and diploma qualifications towards degree level education . For most professional associations ful l membership requires either a certificate, diploma or degree level qualification . ANTA currently does not ac cept full membership in myotherapy unless an applicant has completed an accredited advanced diploma or bachelor degree outlined below . In regard to remedial massage ANTA requires the completion of a diploma for full membership. The level of education and professional practice required for health practitioner statutory registration normally requires a degree l evel qualification and training or qualification through a grandparent ing process . The degree level o f education for remedial massage and myotherapy is currently available under a bachelor degree in myotherapy undertaken at three higher education institutions specified below. This submission is made on the basis that the minimum level of education for reg istration of RMM should be a degree level educational qualification with provision for a period of grand - parenti ng for practitioners with out accepted qualifications and/ or evidence of p rofessional practice in RMM over a sufficient period of time to provide equivalence . This will align with the professionalization process applied in the statutory registration process for Chinese Medicine and as currently underway for Paramedicine .114 Outside of that grand -parenting process a practitioner may be able to obtain the required qualification for registration by complet ion of a degree level standard of qualification in myotherapy or remedial massage required for registration during the grand - parenting period through upgrading a qualification or by completing a degree level qualification . 109 http://joboutlook.gov.au/occupation.aspx?code=4116&search=&Tab=stats&g raph=EL ; Leach 372 suggested this figure was 13.1% M J Leach, 'Profile of the Complementary and Alternative medicine workforce across Australia, New Zealand, Canada, US and UK, (2013) 21 Complementary Therapies in Medicine , 364-378 at 372 . 110 Leach suggest ed 49.2% ibid. 111 Leach suggested 27.6 % had a certificate or high school qualification) and none had education below certificate III.

A process for RMM will require an amendment of the National Law and the approval of a stand ard to enforce this requirement in line with the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law and O ther Legislation Amendment Act 2017 (Qld) which was enacted in Queensland on 13 September 2017 . This legislation establish es the Paramedicine Board of Australia which will specify accepted qualifi cations and training for general registration .115 Qualificati on for registration will al so be allowed for (a) a qualification or prior or board required study, training or supervised practice or (b) based upon practice in paramedicine during the 10 years before the participation day116 or a consecutive period of 5 years or for any periods which together amount to 5 years and satisfies the Paramedicine Board that a person is competent to practise paramedicine .117 This legislation provides for a period of 3 years within which an individual can apply for registration based upon qualifications or trai ning.118 When this grand -parenting period is completed only the completion of an accredited degree three - year degree qualification should be accepted for registration under any statutory regulation process. It should be noted that any unregistered RMM pr actitioner who does not comply with any eligibility requirements under the National Law or who does not seek or obtain registration would still be able to practice RMM but they would not be entitled to use the restric ted titles specified which may apply for RMM such as 'remedial massage therapist' or 'myotherapist.'

The Advanced Diploma of Myotherapy 22316 VIC from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2021 provides for the provision of 855 nominal hours duration of the course. The Advanced Diploma course is offered in the following colleges in Victoria: Australian College of Fitness & Bodywork Endeavour College of Natural Health (Melbourne) Max Therapy Institute Melbourne Institute of Massage Therapy Max Therapy I nstitute Melbourne Institute of Massage Therapy Melbourne Polytechnic RMIT University RMIT Southern School of Natural Therapies VFA Learning Degree level qualification The provision of remedial massage has in recent years include d three -year higher education degrees in myotherapy . Educa tional providers in this space are: Q Academy Brisbane - Degree of Myotherapy 27 Endea vour College of Natural Health - Degree of Myotherapy in Adelaide, Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne Southern School of Natural Therapy Bachelor of Health Science (Clinical Myotherapy) Melbourne The bachelor degree programs may see a rati onalisation of course providers because of t he higher standards expected of tha t form of education and because of stricter Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA)121 audit and q uality control over colleges that deliver these degrees . Australian Skills Quality Authority (ASQA), which is the VET sector regulator previously governed audits and quality control over advanced diplomas at a less stringent level. The move to bachelor degree programs has been supported by most associations. The fact that there are currently three educational institutions in most parts of Australia suggest s that there will be adequate access for students to comply with the required educational standard including upgrading of certificate, diploma and advanced diploma degrees. Significance of adoption of bachelor level educational standard A useful discussi on is provided by ANTA122 in regard to the different educational standards that will apply under the bachelor degree standard as against the standard specified under the Diploma based upon the AQF specifications.123 Under the Bachelor Degree (AQF Level 7) the expectations of graduate outcomes are:124 'Knowledge: Graduates at this level will have broad and coherent theoretical and technical knowledge with depth in one or more disciplines or areas of practice. Skills: Graduates at this level will have well -devel oped cognitive, technical and communication skills to select and app ly methods and technologies to: Analyse and evaluate information to complete a range of activities Analyse, generate and transmit solutions to unpredictable and sometimes complex problems Transmit knowledge, skills and ideas to others Application of Knowledge and Skills: Graduates at this level will apply knowledge and skills to demonstrate autonomy, well developed judgement and responsibility: in contexts that require self -directed work and learning within broad parameters to provide specialist advice and functions' 'Public and industry expectations now require natural therapy practitioners to :125 have skills to exercise critical thinking and problem solving have skills to critically rev iew and analyse information and knowledge have the knowledge and ability to act independently 121 TEQSA is the H ighe r Education statutory regulator under the discussed in more detail below. http://www.teqsa.gov.au/ . 122 ANTA, Submission to Community Services & Health Industry Skills Council on Complementary & Alternative Health Alignment of Qualifications to the Australian Qualifications Framework 26th November 2013, 4 -6 123 Australian Qualifications Framework (second edition January 2013) 41, 42. 124 Ibid 47 -48. 125 Ibid 28 be able to adapt knowledge and skills in diverse contexts The above attributes are typically found in bachelor degree programs.' Higher Education Regulation Myotherapy degrees are regulated by TEQSA which is Australia's independent statutory regulator of the higher education sector.126 TEQSA indicates that its role and impact on the higher education is based upon the need to:127 'safeguard the interests of all curre nt and future students studying within Australia's higher education system. It does this by regulating and assuring the quality of Australia's higher education providers. TEQSA is responsible for the registration and re -registration of providers and the ac creditation and re-accreditation of courses .' TEQSA's regulatory approach is standards and risk -based. It is guided by three regulatory principles - regulatory necessity, reflecting risk and proportionate regulati on, when exercising its powers. Standards b ased regulation:128 'provider entry to and continued operations within Australia's higher education sector are determined by demonstrated compliance with the Higher Education Standards Framework (Threshold Standards) the standards are developed and promulgated independently of TEQSA by the Higher Education Standards Panel the standards apply to all providers, offering courses leading to a regulated higher education award, irrespective of where and how a course is delivered while all providers must demonstrate adherence to the Th reshold Standards, TEQSA assesses these in the context of each provider's circumstances the standards are applied flexibly and with regard to the diversity of teaching methods and delivery modes that exist and are emerging within the sector. The standards are not intended, or applied, to limit higher achievement .' Education providers offering a bachelor degree will need to satisfy the Higher Education Standards Framework (Threshold Standards) including the profession specific obligations in relation to Learning Outcomes and Assessment clause 1.4 (set out in Schedule B to this submission) including knowledge a nd skills that characterise the field of education or disciplines involved, knowledge and skills required for employment and skills in independent and critical thinking suitable for life -long learning. Risk -based Regulation 'TEQSA's risk-based approach ensures that resources are directed to areas of higher risk based on validated, qualit y intelligence about a provider. Key aspects of this approach include the Higher Education Standards Framework , the Case Manager model, the Agency's Regulatory Risk Framework , the use of ex perts and engagement with professional bodies .'129This means that any higher education providers of RMM are subject to TEQSA oversight and the standards required by 126 http://www.teqsa.gov.au / 127 http://www.teqsa.gov.au/regulatory -approach 128 http://www.teqsa.gov.au/regulatory -approach 129 http://www.teqsa.gov.au/regulatory -approach 29 all higher education providers. In the case of universities which are sel f-accrediting institutions their regulation is more light touch while in the case of non -university institutions such as privat e colleges , these are generally non self -accrediting institutions which are su bject to greater scrutiny by TEQS A including reviewing and approving courses and programs, applying performance conditions to approvals during a specifie d accreditation period wh ich relate the specific degrees or courses .130 The heightened supervision by TE QSA against the training for industry approach of ASQA will mean that that their activities will be monitored for quality and educational outcomes at a higher standard of professi onal practice . Research The provision of RMM has a well -developed and rapidly burgeoning body of knowledge that can form the basis of its standards of practice . Funding for research into CAM including RMM comes from both the government and private fundi ng sources .131 The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) prompted by reports about th e use of treatment s, including CAM , without an adequate evidence basis to treat chronic, or serious medical conditions has placed a greater focus on this issu e.132 The increasing interest by regulators in CAM is reflected in the inclusion in the NHMRC Strategic Plan 2010 -2012, of 'examining alternative therapy claims' as a major health issue for consideration by the organisation, including the provision of resear ch funding. In the current Strategic Plan 2013 -2015, NHMRC has broadened its focus to investigate the general issue of 'Claiming benefits for human health not based on evidence'.' 'With regard to CAM, NHMRC is undertaking a number of activities that align with its commitment outlined in its Strategic Plan 2013 -2015 with the aim of assisting Australians in making informed decisions about their health care. This includes consideration of the potential benefits and risks of each option using the available evi dence. Current activities include:133 Developing a resource for clinicians to facilitate discussion with patients regarding their use of CAM. Continuing to increase knowledge through the funding of investigator -driven research on CAM through NHMRC's competit ive, peer -reviewed grant application processes. Reviewing the effectiveness of a range of CAM using established methods for identifying and assessing evidence. ' NHMRC, under the guidance of the Health Care Committee, has developed a resource for clinicians to facilitate discussion with patients regarding their use of C AM. A notable research institute in Australia on issu es relevant to RMM is The National Institute of Complementary Medicine at Western Sydney Universit y.134 The Institute's website indica tes it is active in clinical trials, publications , provision of scholarships, international collaborations and continuing professional development. The Institute has benefited from millions of dollars of research 130 http://www.nicm.edu.au/ 30 funding f rom industry and benefactors.135 In 2013 the Research Centre released the Research Priorities for Complementary Medicine in Australia report :136 'To help identify priorities for research in Australia, a review was commissioned of the available evidence for the therapeutic use of CM in Australia's National Health Priority areas. This report documents the key findings of the review, and the processes undertaken to arrive at the findings. ' The report seeks to 'narrow the field' and identify those treatment s that o ffer the greatest potential to meet Australia's healthcare needs. The approach involved harnessing the expertise of some of Australia's leading experts, in a cooper ative and collaborative process, to shortlist the best candidates for future research inves tment . The end result is a considered perspective of where future research inves tment should be directed.' Chapter 6 of this report is focused on Arthritis and Muscu loskeletal Condition s which includes references to and the value in treatment from RMM . Ther e are eleven references to massage in this document indicating its role in the research agenda of this research centre. Another significant research centre involved in research in regard to CAM which includes RMM is the Australian Research Centre in Compl ementary and Integrative Medicine (ARCCIM) at the Faculty of Health , University of Technology, Sydney .137 ARCCIM states: 'it is the world -leading critical public health research centre focusing on complementary and integrative health care. The scientific investigation of complementary and integrative medicine is paramount when addressing contemporary health systems and global health challenges. At ARCCIM, we believe this requires a synergy of critical perspective s, genuine collaboration and a commitment to produce meaningful insights. ' ARCCIM state s it has been involved in the following research achiev ements:138 '$11 million in external competitive grant funding, including 18 grants funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council and Australian Research Council 5 prestigious government -funded (NHMRC and ARC) Research Fellowships $3.5 million in industry/community partnership funding authoring 700+ peer -reviewed publications, including 11 research books wit h prestigious international publishing houses the largest concentration of PhD students focused upon complementary and integrative health care in Australia. ' ARCCIM is the first centre worldwide dedicated to conducting and promoting critical CAM research via a wide range of established methods and perspectives from public health and health services research. Significantly in 2017 ARCCIM announced the International Complementary Medicine Research Leadership and Capacity Building Program (Massage Therapy Fel lowship in partnership with the Massage and Myotherapy Australia) . ARCCIM has recruit ed a Fellow with a track record and commitment to mas sage and/or myotherapy research. The candidate must have an emerging 135www.westernsydney.edu.au/newscentre/news_centre/research_success_stories/leading_national_complementary_ medicine_agency_to _receive_significant_funding 136 -centre/vision -and-mission Ibid 31 track record in massage therapy -focused scholarsh ip and research output and the potential and commitment to develop and this research output in the area of massage and myotherapy research.139 There has been criticism of the lack of research outputs from private colleges.140 One study suggested there was domi nance by public universities in CAM related research outputs and a lack of commitment to building research capacity with a drop of f in research by researchers after commencing teaching at a private college.141 The Endea vour College of Natural Health has in the last two years established an Office of Research including a research committee, a research ethics committee and has funded internally and externally research projects on RMM and has commenced a collaborative partnership with the ARCCIM . 142 Some major professional associations provide funding or access to participants for research projects by researchers as part of their day-to-day function.143 The focus on research by the profession is exemplified by reports and the provision of access to research information for practitioners and researchers about MT. ANTA provides to its members free access to scientific resources including ESBCO Host , eMIMS , IMgateway Massage & Myotherapy Australia , both major professional associations have commissioned reports on research about the scientific evidence of the risks and benefits of RMM .145 Massage & Myotherapy Australia has a partnership with ARCCIM (Austr alian Research Centre in Complementary and Integrative Medicine). Massage & Myotherapy Australia offer ed one week's postgraduate learning at the Australian Institute of Sport in Soft Tissue in 2017 .146A recent massage research output from ARCCIM is on the t opic: Is there an association between women's consultations with a massage therapist and health -related quality of life? Analyses of 1800 women aged 56 - 61 year s: Journal of Bodywork & Movement Therapies (2016) 20, 734 -739. Articles focusing on research are regularly part of the profession association journals. Institutional Recognition Private Health Funds The increasing popularity of RMM has resulted in resp onses from many government and private sector organi sations including health insurance , professional indemnity insurers , ATO, higher education and NHMRC . Many heal th insurance provide rs offer rebates on health practitioner fees for RMM .147 Based upon the ANT A website148which regularly provides an update of health insurance rebates the following health insurers provide rebates for the provision of J Wardle, A Steel and J Adams, 'A Review of Tensions and Risks in Naturopathic Education and Training in Australia: A Need for Regulation,' (2012) 18 (4) The Journal of Alterna tive and Complementary Medicine 363, 364. 366, Schedule C 61 . And exampled by Kat Boehringer, AMT, In Good Hands March 2014 Research Study Update, 14 -15 144 http://www.australiannaturaltherapistsassociation.com.au/resources/ebscoho Refer to Schedule C pp 65. Federal Minister of Health Greg Hunt in a Media Release 16 October outlined future limits on health insurance rebates for some complementary medicines including Naturopathy, Herbalism, Homeopathy as well as Alexander 32 Traditional Chinese Medicine Massage - 13 Health Funds (require diploma in modality) Myothera py - 12 Health Funds Remedial Therapies - 17 Health Funds Shiatsu 3 - Health Funds (require diploma in modality) This indicates a broad acceptance of the role of RMM in the provision of health care in Australia. In the absence of registration status for RMM it is necessary for the health funds to provide a process to establish the credentials of RMM practitioners to ensure they are appropriately qualified. Under the Private Health Insurance (Accreditation) Rules 2011 there are specific requirements before a health practitioner can offer a rebate to clients for their services under the private health insurance policy based upon the terms of each policy. Treatment provided by complementary medicine practitioners is only eligible for coverage by private health insurance if the practitioner is duly registered such as applies to chiropractic, osteopathy and Chinese Medicine for the treatment conte mplated by that registration. For other unregistered complementary medicine practitioners to be eligible for private health rebates they must be a member of a national professional association which assesses the training and education qualifications of members; the professional association must conduct a compulsory professional development scheme for members; it must have an enforced code of conduct and a formal disciplinary procedure to suspend or expel members and an appropriate complaints procedure.149 In addition , any State or Territory premises legislative requirements must be satisfied.150 Most private health insurer s have additional requirements before recognising a complementary medicine practitioner as eligible for the health fund rebate for clients. These requirements normally relate to having suitable professional indemnity insurance, requirements about keeping good records, demonstrated participation in continuing professional education, the ability to lodge information electronically and the practitioner having a current first aid certificate. Not all health insurance companies cover complementary medicine and thos e that do cover these services do not cover all modalities. This suggests that as the access to health insurance rebates is a significant financial issue for practitioners that the control over access to health rebates applied by health funds is an aspect of the regulatory control over the practice of RMM .151 No doubt the move to bachelor degree status for some RMM providers will result in a review of the required educational standards for eligibility for health rebates after a period of grand parenting. It should be noted that it is still possible to practice and hold out as a RMM practitioner without access to health fund rebates. Worker Compensation Insurance There is access to the benefits provided by Work Cover for the provision of RMM in some jurisdicti ons normally focussed on the potential for the provision of remedial physical therapies. RMM is not specifically mentioned in workers compensation legislation though in South Australia there is provision for treatment by remedial physical therapies for dip loma qualified proposed changes which are to commence in 2019 appear to have li mited impact on RMM.

It is possible for individual practitioners to approach a professional indemnity insurance company individually , but most major professional associations have a negotiated indemnity arrangement with an insurance company which accepts the standard of education and training required for membership of the professional association as sufficient for acceptance of the pra ctitioner. All major professional associations require professional indemnity insurance as a condition of membership. Some of the professional indemnity insurance companies are: Therapy S ure154 Arthur J Gallagher155 BizCover156 Fenton Green157 If there was a national standard for education this would likely reduce the time necessary for underwriters to be satisfied about the quality of education of practitioners .158 Conclusion , Criterion 4 RMM is at its best a well -defined profession , with well-developed pro fessional standards where some modalities now require a higher education level for normal acceptance into the profession. Many other institutions and bodies such as health funds and professional indemnity insurers are prepared to regu late or endorse the pr actice of RMM . This suggests that there is a secure basis to implement regulation. Although practitioners are currently permitted to access health fund rebates for the benefit of clients, professional indemnity insurance for their c lients ' protection the regulatory structure RMM may be subject to change or exclusion as time proceeds. A much more solid basis for the continuation of high quality RMM and the protection of cons umers is through statutory regulation. Criterion 5: Is regulation practical to i mplement for the occupation in question? When considering whether regulation of the occupation is practical the following should be considered: 153 http://www.icontact -archive.com/TfWiFvrku1_2VLqaoi9l2iM0ws4_Pbqf?w=3 ; In s 59 Workers Compensation Act 1987 (NSW) s 59.

Size of RMM profession There are many RMM practitione rs in Australia (in excess of 15 ,000) according to one source.159 As indicated above , CAM practitioners provide a significant part of the provision of health care in Australia. Generally (though not all) RMM practitio ners and their professional associations favour statutory regulation. ANTA, founded in 1955 is the largest national democratic association of 'recognised professional' traditional medicine and natural therapy practitioners (including a large percentage of RMM practitioners) who work in the areas of health care and preventive medicine. The full profile of ANTA is found at Schedule C of this submission. Professional Associations Most professional associations favour statutory registration for RMM . The ANPA ,160 Complementary Medicines Australia ,161 Massage and Myopathy Australia162 Association of Massage Therapists Ltd163 and ANTA strongly support statutory registration.164 By contrast Australian Traditional Medicine Society (A RMM S) does not support statutory regulat ion.165 It is stated on its website that: 'ARMM S adopted the self -regulation model, later to become the Co -Regulation model. This was opposed to the Statutory Registration model that was sought by TCM. It was felt this model was not appropriate for the occup ations that fall under the umbrella of natural medicine. Regulation of the occupations has always been a major point of difference between ANTA, NHAA and A RMM S, the former supporting statutory registration, A RMM S never wavering from the opposite view.'166 International Examples of Statutory Regulation of RMM 159 Above 12 to A NTA profile Schedule C below, 49 . 165 http://www.atms.com.au/ 166 http://www.atms.com.au/page.php?id=26 35 There are a number of international jurisdictions that provide for a form of statutory regulation indicating there is in those jurisdictions a policy imperative to provide for public safet y in the provision of RMM and that statutory regulation is possible for RMM . These examples indicate that the provision of statutory regulation of RMM is possible and deemed necessary in these jurisdictions. This analysis will focus on two jurisdictions namely the US A and Canada which provide fo r statutory regulation of RMM . USA The USA regulatory structure for RMM has feature s not present in Canada or Aust ralia. In the USA there is strict regulation of 'the practice of medicine ' involving a broad definition of that term with legislation intent to proscribe health practices performed by non -registrants such as CAM practitioners which might trespass into the practice of medicine unless they enjoy statutory registration or acknowledg ement. This promotes the provision o f registration of various CAM therapies such as TCM, naturopathy and RMM . There are 47 states of the USA which have massage practice laws covering RMM .167 The American Massage Therapy Association (AMTA) suggests :168 \"Massage therapy has a significant impact on a person's health and well -being. The public has a right to expect that a massage therapist has the qualifications needed to practice effectively and safely. So, legal recognition of the practice of massage therapy and clearly -stated requirements to practice are essential to promote the profession and protect the health, safety and welfare of the general public.\" The AMTA suggests legal recognition of RMM through state licensure: creates standards of minimum competency measured and enforced through formal education, training, and examination requirements. it ensures that individuals have met the eligibility requirements needed to practice massage therapy and are qualified to represent themselves to the public as state licensed massage therapists. a legal definition of the scope of massage therapy practice, assists consumers identify the responsibilities and services unique to a massage therapist and to select the most appropriate massage therapy professional with a transparent the selection process. provides the ability to discipline a massage therapist for non -compliant practitioners. protects the public by establishing a consistent standard of practice which is enforceable by a professional code of ethics and establishes a formal grievance proces s for consumers .169 A typical example of regulation is the New York State Board of Massage Therapy which provides for York licensed massage therapists who have completed a massage training program, including the following: courses in anatomy, physiology, neu rology, myology (study of muscles and their function), pathology, hygiene, first aid, CPR, and infection control procedures 167 https://www.amtamassage.org/about/lawstate.html 168 https://www.amtamassage.org/regulation/Why -We-Need -Massage -Ther apy-Regulations.html 169 Ibid 36 course work, training and practice in the theory and techniques of both oriental and western massage State licensing examination inc luding 1000 hours of training.170 Most states regulate the massage therapy profession. Depending on the state, this could be in the form of a license, registration or certification. Cities, coun ties or other local governm ents also may regulate massage. Licensing is the strictest form of professional regulation, making it illegal for anyone to work as a massage therapist unless he or she has a license. An example of a licensure provision is in Sou th Carolina which limits the practice massage/bodywork without a licence.171 Under Chapter 30 of the Massage/Bodywork Practice Act s 40-30-100 provision for licencing of this modality is established. SECTION 40 -30-100. Practice without license. No person may practice massage/bodywork without a license issued in accordance with this chapter by the director; however, a person licensed by the State under this title or any other provision of law whose scope of practice overlaps with the practice of massage/bodywo rk is not also required to be licensed under this chapter unless the person holds himself out to be a practitioner of massage/bodywork. Nothing in this chapter may be construed to authorize a massage/bodywork therapist licensed under this chapter to practi ce physical therapy or chiropractic or to utilize chiropractic therapeutic modalities except where the scope of practice for massage/bodywork, as provided for in this chapter, overlaps with the practice of physical therapy or chiropractic. Interpretations of section 40 -30-30 A. A person who advertises as a massage/bodywork therapist when a person uses or adopts any title or description, including but not limited to \"massage 'body therapist, ' 'masseur, ' 'masseuse, ' 'massagist ' or any other derivation of these terms implying the practice of massage/bodywork therapy. B. A person who is licensed to practice massage/bodywork therapy shall not diagnose illness or disease, perform medical procedures, chiropractic adjus tments , utilize electro -therapeutic devices as defined in Section 40 -30-30, prescribe medicines, or engage in practices for which a license to practice medicine, chiroprac tic, nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, acupuncture or podiatry is required by law, unless the person is duly licensed in that profession.172 Canada Canada has a number of jurisdictions that provides for statutory regulation of RMM . Massage therapy is governed by provincially -legislated regulatory and registration authorities. Massage therapy is a regulated health profession in the provinces of Ontario, British Columbia, New Bruns wick, Newfoundland and Labrador. T here are established regulator y authorities (Colleges) which regulate the standards of practice and conduct of massage therapists to protect the public interest. 170 http://www.op.nysed.gov/prof/mt/mtlic.htm 171 http://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t40c030.php 172 http://www.llr.state.sc.us/POL/MassageTherapy/index.asp?file=interpretations_of_the_massage_p.htm 37 In all three provinces that regulate Massage Therapy the regulation entails protection of title. In the British Columbia Health Professions Act (HPA) reference is made to the creation of Colleges that regulate health professions in BC such as Chiropractors, dentist s etc. Under BC regulation BC 280/2008 the College of Massage Therapists of British Columbia is established under the HPA including a specified definition of MT with the titles 'Massage therapist ', 'registered massage therapist ', 'massage practitioner ' and 'registered massage practitioner ' being reserved only for registrants. Administration of drugs, anaesthetics , a recent bone fracture, medical electricity or high velocity low amplitude thrust is prohibited for massage therapy registrants. Similarly, the Ontario Massage Therapy Act 1991 establishes the College of Massage Therapies of Ontario under S0 1991 Chapter 27 . This legislation sets out a scope of practice and restricted titles of 'massage therapist ' or 'registered massage therapist ' which only registrants can use. Massage therapy is deemed to be a Self -Governing Health Profession under Schedule 1 of the Regula ted Health Professions Act, 1991, S.O. 1991, c. 18. Section 4 of this legislation incorporates into the Massage Therapy Act a procedural code in relation such as disciplinary matters. Under t he Massage Therapy Act 2005 St John's, Newfoundland and Labrado r establishes a Newfoundland and Labrador Massage Therapists Board, limits the use of titles ' Massage therapist ', 'registered massage therapist ', 'licensed massage therapist ' and the term 'RMT ' to registrants . Chinese Medicine Model in Australia For Chin ese Medicine , protected titles under the National Law are Chinese medicine practitioner, Chinese herbal dispenser, Chinese herbal medicine practitioner, Oriental medicine practitioner, and acupuncturist. For the Chinese Medicine Registration Board of V ictoria and now under the national board , there have been practical challenges in the normal issues involved in professionali sation . These include the limits of 'grand parenting' practitioners who may seek to obtain registration based on clinical experience; setting the appropriate standards for education including learning outcomes ; educating the profession, private health funds, and the public about th e role of the board . In addition , it is necessary to align standards for practice with other registratio n boa rds to ensure this regulation deals with national standards of practice and the costs of regulation in terms of the impact on practitioner and governmental costs of regulation .173 It is likely that similar practical issues will emerge for RMM should statut ory regulation be undertaken, but the problems are not insurmou ntable. I t is likely the number of RMM potential registrants will be higher than for Chinese Medicine . This may reduce the cost to government of regulation and for practitioners based upon the greater numbers of practitioner s providing registration fees. In addition , some of the cost of dealing with the evidence of training and education from overseas institutions in a foreign language as well as the difficulties of cu ltural fit may be less problematic . The major practical issue is the question of how to defi ne the professions. It is clear that RMM involves definable practice s and a definable prof ession. For a RMM practitioners in the context of where there are no protected titles any person even one with limited training and education can use generic prof essional titles (such as massage therapist) or in terms of the individual modalities that they offer. If titles do become protected for RMM , a designated generic and/or specific title (s) will need to be determined . The se protected titles might conflict with some of the titles currently being used by practitioners who may be unable to become registered for reasons of lack of education or clinical experience . This will also impact on education pro viders, professional associations, private 173 La Trobe report above n 70 , 299 -302. 38 health funds, and taxation authorities (under the GST exemption legislation). Although this is an issue , it was dealt under the regulation of Chinese M edicine and will no doubt result in a rationali sation of the m arketplace for some non -registered practition ers. Any registration b oard for RMM will need to make informed , responsible and evidenced based decision s about what titles should be restricted focussing on the public interest which is the primary focus of thi s regulation.174 Criterion 6: Do the benefits to the public of regulation clearly outweigh the potential negative impact of such regulation ?175 Benefits: It will greatly enhance the ability of consumers to identify qualified RMM practitioners bound by sta tutorily enforceable disciplinary procedures regulated by AHPRA. The move to statutory regulation would permit by statute under the National Law access to an objective transparent and accountable system for managing complaints and professional misconduct (including access to an appeals process) which will involve community and practitioner representatives with statutory backing for determinations made including fines, conditions of practice, further education , suspension and exclusion primarily focussed on public interest considerations.176 The use of statutory regulation is likely to result in i mproved qualit y and safety in healthcare as a result of bett er communication and referral among qualified practitioners including orthodox medicine practitioners wh o will both share the status of being registered health practitioners.177 The greater level of scrutiny by a well -resourced regulatory body and the role of AHPRA is likely to result in b etter information and protection for consumers . The qualification fo r registration will require the imposition of i mproved and co nsistent standards of education which will include policies, guidelines and requirements provided by the relevant registration board which will result in better quality assurance processes and foster greater research in the moda lity for the benefit of consumer safety.178 Better assuranc e for insurers and employers of appropriate standards of training of practitioners leading to better public safety outcomes . The use of registration of RMM will s upport community confidence in the professions and bring enhanced status for practitioners .179 Statutory regulation will support the process of integrating complementary and alternative healt hcare practices into the health system . 174 Ibid 175 La Trobe report, above 70 , 303. 176 For example , under Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Act 2009 (Qld) ss 155, 191 and 196 . 177 La Trobe report, above 70, 13 178 Ibid 179 Ibid 303 39 Statutory regulation will result in increased collaborations between public hospitals, universities and government institutions and private sector heath providers , educators and professional associations in the health and education sectors . Statutory regulation will result in dec reased administrative burden for funds and insurers as the standards of training and education will be clarified and standardised w ith efficiencies that may lead to lower costs for funds and insurers.180 Statutorily enforced c ompulsory prof essional indemn ity insurance will protect patients from the financial consequences of negligent practice when injuries occur.181 Negative Impacts Many of these potential negative impacts are natural consequences of limiting registration to only those practitioners who co mply with registration standards. The p otential increase in fees for practitioners ( including registration costs and in addition membership of professional association s) may mean higher fees charged to consumers .182 Increased restrictions to entry to prac tice of the profession which may result in a lessening of competition in the marketplace which may result in higher professional fees.183 Statutory regulation may increase costs for some educational institutions to upgrade courses which may result in highe r fees for students .184 Statutory regulation may result in a loss (or diminution) of income for practitioners precluded from registration who are not able to use grand parenting provisions.185 Statutory regulation may require practitioners to fund what may be required to upgrade qualifications to achieve registration .186 Statutory regulation may result in l oss of market share or closure for educational institutions unable to upgrade to meet higher standards .187 The benefits of promoting public safety clearly o utweigh the potential negative impacts of occupational regulation which primarily relate to personal financial impacts to registrants, non - registrants and colleges .188 Overall assessment against IGA Criteria 180 Ibid 181 Ibid 182 Ibid 183 Ibid 184 186 Ibid 187 Ibid 188 La Trobe report, above n 70 , 302. 40 The data above dealing with the extent of invo lvement of CAM in the health sector shows that the use of CAM is wides pread .189 This submission concludes that :190 the regulation of RMM is within the appropriate responsibility of health ministers; evidence suggests some RMM practices and practitioners pose a significant risk of harm which will be alleviated by statutory regulation ; existing regulatory mechanisms are inadequate for safeguarding and protecting consumers of RMM ; there are definable modali ties within RMM such that it is possible to implement a form of statutory regulation as discussed in this submission ; there will be some practical challenges for statutory regulation, but lessons can be drawn from overseas experience and the Victorian and national statutory regulation of Chinese Medicine and Paramedicine in Australia ; and the benefits of protecting public safety through statutory regulation does outweigh the potential negative impacts . Options for Regulatory Models There may be six general models for the regulation of the health workforce :191 Self-regulation -membership of a professional association could provide evidence that the practitioner has suitable qualifications , is safe to practise and is subject to a disciplinary scheme to deal with unethical or unprofessional practice . Negative l icensing - a practitioner may enter and practise a self -regulated profession unless the practitioner is shown to have breache d the provisions of a code of conduct making the practitioner ineligible or limited in their ability to practise by order of the re gulator. Co-regulation - members of a professional as sociation are regulated by an association with government involvement . Reservation of title only - a statutory registration board registers members of a profession and reserves the use of restricted titles for registrants only . Reservation of title and core practices - certain procedures considered to be high risk normally applied in the practice of a profession are by statute restricted to registrants and other specified registered health profession s. 189 Charlie C Xue et al, 'Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use in Australia: A National Population -Based Survey' [2007] (July -August) 13 (6) Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine 643, 6 43; Jon Wardle et al , above n 11 , 199. 190 La Trobe report, above n 70 , 304. 191 Ibid 304 41 Reservation of title and whole practice restriction - this model restricts the use of restricted titles, within the defined scope of practice of a profession, and prohibits non-registrants from practising the profession. Self-Regulation192 The model of self-regulation assumes that the industry normally through professional association membership has appropriate mechanism s and financial capacity to monitor and discipline members of the profession. RMM is primarily self-regulated at present though the lev el of regulation is limited . Although myotherapy has moved to a bachelor degree level of educ ation and there is a process of upgrading of educational standard s for RMM this will be to some extent stymied by the continuation of professional associations which have lower level educational qualifications . The primary regulatory limitation of self -regulation is that any standards required by professional associations may be difficult to enforce owing to a lack of resources of some professional associations and any breach resulting in professional discipline may not stop the practitioner from continuing in the profession as they may seek to become a member of another professional association or remain in practice without membership in a professional association. Co-Regulation Co-regulation, a form of government monitored self -regula tion, has been proposed by some professional associations within the sector in particular A RMM S. Under such a model, there would be government al oversight of mechanisms and procedures .193 This would most likely require the government ei ther to monitor numerous bodies or facilitat e the establishment of a single regulatory authority separate from profess ional associations . This may become an intrusive process and could involve high transac tion costs which may be borne by taxpayers .194 Negative Licensing A system of negative licensin g could offer protection to the community against negligent or inappropriate behav iour. There have been substantial initiatives in the form of regulation as discussed above and culminating in the proposal for a National Code of Conduct for Health Care Workers. Queensland has already enacted the National Code of Conduct for Health Care Workers (Queensland) reflecting the national model under Regulation 5 of the He alth Ombudsman Regulation 2014 as has Victoria under the Health Complaints Act 2016 (Vic) Schedule 2. The Code is a form of negative licensing which: 'sits on a contin uum of regulations between self -regulation and statutory regulations. It is more targete d, less restrictive and is a less costly form of regulation than statutory regulation, since it provides the regulatory tools to deal directly with those who behave illegally or in an incompetent, exploitative or predatory manner and, if necessary prohibit them from practicing. It leaves the vast majority of ethical and competent members of an unregistered health profession to self -regulate, 192 Ibid 193 Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council, Final Report, Options for Regulation of Unregistered Health Practitioners , April 2013, 19. 194 La Trobe report, above n 70 , 305 42 but provides an additional level of public protection with respect to unregistered practitioners, at minimal cost to the community.'195 This form of regulation does not impose substantial regulatory costs upon practitioners if they comply with the Code while allowing a disqualification for specified attributes, events or offences.196 This allows the enforcement of a minimu m standard of practice without the cost of a statutory registration board.197 Those who are shown to not be fit to provide health services can be prevented from doing so. In this way rogue practitioners can be controlled without a substantial cost to the community.198 From a regulatory perspective , a significant limitation of this type of regulation is that the regulation is reactive , not proactive , as the remedies will only be available when a breach of the code of conduct has occurred , which may mean that a n egative outcome has already arisen .199 Statutory Regulation The following models are all forms of statutory regulation Reservation of title only ; Reservation of title and core practices; Reservation of title and whole practice restriction. The focus unde r the National Law has been away from any regulation involving a whole of practice restriction and a reservation of title that was up until the 1990s the normal model for the regulation of health professions in Australia. Since the Competition Policy Revie w, the role of the state in regulating professions was questioned owing to its potential to cre ate anti -competitive outcomes . Statutory regulation is a well -established model for healt h professions across Australia. The legislative frameworks and operation al arrangements used in other health professions can be readily adapted and applied to RMM \u2014as has already been done in the case of Chinese Medicine. The current National Registration and Accreditation Scheme for the Health Professions (NRASHP) framework a lso repres ents a form of co -regulation in that it is a co -operative arrangement bet ween government and profession. A RMM board could be integrated wit h existing boards (for example, the Chinese Medicine Registration Board) to improve efficien cy of operatio n and reduce the cost to government and registrants . The use of a reservatio n of title only would appear to be the most cost effective and appropriate f orm of statutory regulation for RMM and this could easily be aligned with the NRASHP . Conclusion and Recommendations In considering the application of the IGA criteria for hea lth workforce regulation to the current state of RMM practice within Australia, it is concluded that a negative licensing model currently becoming a national Code of Conduct is a useful regulatory mechanism . It prevent s those practitioners who engage in seriously unethical or illegal conduct from continuing to practice or practising without scrutiny but it does not protect from clearly unethical and untrained practitioners from enter ing the workforce . Statutory regulat ion is desirable and warranted for the following reasons : 195 Austral ian Health Ministers Advisory Council, Final Report, Options for Regulation of Unregistered Health Practitioners , April 2013, 24 -25. 196 Ibid 197 Ibid 31; Arie Freiburg, The Tools of Regulation (The Federation Press, 2010), 151. 198 Australian Health Ministe rs Advisory Council, above n 195 , 24-25. 199 Freiburg, above n 197 , 150. 43 there is a lev el of risk in RMM comparable to other regulated professions; existing regulatory frameworks are insufficient to protect against professional miscon duct and to protect consumers . 'The public are entitled to accessible health services and they have the right to be assured that these practitioners are bound by minimum standards of practice and training, and to be able to make informed choices based on these factors. Regulation should not be primarily focussed on the practitioner but upon the patient.'200 200 Jon Wardle, 'The National Registration and Accreditation Scheme: what would inclusion mean for naturopathy and Western Herbal Medicine', (2010) 22 (4) Australian Journal of Medical Herbal ism 113,114. 44 Schedule A Date Modality Qualifications Charge Citation and Jurisdiction 2016 Therapeutic Massage Unclear Assault and act of indecency Baines v R [2016] NSWCCA 132 (NSW) 2015 Therapeutic Massage Some training Indecent assault DPP v Van Dorp [2015] VCC 1748 (Vic) 2013 Massage therapy Qualified Masseur unlawful and indecent dealing with a child under 16 years R v McCallum [2013] QCA 254 (Qld) 2014 Massage therapy Unclear Sexual assault Queen v Gary Joseph Bourdon 2014 ABCA 34 (Canada - British Columbia ) 2012 Remedial Massage Unclear rape non -custodial supervision order for mental impairment DPP v Soliman [2012] VCC 658 (Vic) 2013 Therapeutic Massage Unclear indecent assault R v E ngland [2013] SASCFC 79 (20 August 2013) (SA) 2012 Therap eutic Massage Certificate Rape and Indecent assault Brennan v The Queen [2012] VSCA 151 (Vic) 2012 Therapeutic massage Unclear Sexual as sault Queen v Dacpano 2012 ONSC 1232 (Canada - Ontario) 2011 Swedish massage and bowen therapy yes Indecent, assault, rape, sexual penetration of a child, indecent acts in presence of a child Wilson v The Queen [2011] VSCA 328 (Vic) 2010 Therapeutic Ma ssage Diploma sexual intercourse w/o consent and indecency Jiang v R [2010] NSWCCA 277 45 Date Modality Qualifications Charge Citation and Jurisdiction 2010 Therapeutic Massage Unclear sexual intercourse w/o consent and indecency Salmond v R [2010] NSWCAA 141 (NSW) 2010 Therapeutic massage Unclear sexual ass ault R v Piper 2010 BCPC 108 (Canada - British Columbia ) 2008 Massage therapy Unclear sexual assault R v Owen [2008] QCA 171 (Qld) 2008 Massage therapy Unclear indecent assault R v Sutton [2008] QCA 249 (Qld) 2008 Therapeutic massage Unclear indecent assault Fernando v R [2008] NSWCC 97 (NSW) 2008 Therapeutic Massage Unclear sexual intercourse w/o consent and indecency Campbell v Richardson [2008] NSWC 122 (NSW) 2006 Therapeutic Massage Unclear sexual intercourse w/o consent and ind ecency R v Qin [2008] NSWDC 41 2006 Massage therapy Unclear indecent assault R v Coram [2006] Q CA 313 (NSW) 2005 Ther apeutic massage Unclear sexual intercourse w ithout consent Jackson v R [2005] NSWCCA 411 (NSW) 2005 Therapeutic massage Unclear indecent dealing, rape and sexual assault R v Bas [2005] QCA 97 (Qld) 46 Date Modality Qualifications Charge Citation and Jurisdiction 2003 Remedial Massage Unclear sexual intercourse without consent R v Porteus [2003] NSWCCA 18 (NSW) 2002 Therapeutic massage Professional Masseur?
