Currently the content is integrated into the general residency curriculum, with additional training available as an elective for PGY 4 residents and virtual observers from other institutions. ACGME Milestones for Psychiatry training emphasize competency in the area of patient care, medical knowledge, practice-based learning and improvement, and professionalism. One goal for training is to become a psychiatrist who serves as a role model and teacher of compassion, integrity, respect for others, and sensitivity to diverse patient populations. A goal under medical knowledge includes knowing drug-supplement/herb interactions. One milestone that is evaluated for residents is \"accountability to self, patients, colleagues and the profession\" with subsection for fatigue management and work balance. Integrative Medicine broadly defines a clinical paradigm that is patient-centered, healing-oriented, health promoting, and embracing of appropriate therapeutic approaches whether they originate in conventional or complementary medicine (Dodds et al, 2013). It reaffirms the importance of the therapeutic relationship, focuses comprehensively on the whole person, and renews attention to healing (Institute of Medicine, 2009b). Practitioners are called to exemplify and commit themselves to self-exploration and self-development. Mind body medicine, which is an important component of integrative medicine, particularly emphasizes and provides skills for provider wellness, self-awareness, reflection, and compassion toward the self and others.
