The classification of practices and definitions of Traditional Medicine varies in different countries depending on the availability, accessibility, cultural and historical significance, and regulations. In Nepal T&CM is implied as Ayurveda and Alternative medicine. National Health Policy 2074 defines other Alternative system as Yoga, Naturopathy, Sowa Rigpa, Homeopathy, Unani, Traditional Chinese Medicine, and traditional medicine and practices. There isvery limited knowledge about institutions providing T&CM service, Information on what conditions do patients usually consult for at T&CMs, type of services they provide, exact location of the particular kind of services and number of T&CM providing institutions inside Kathmandu Valley will be beneficial to service seekers This study aims to collect information on the availability of Traditional and Complementary service facilities through GIS mapping to provide a complete picture of spatial distribution of facilities in Nepal. The study was conducted in two phases; initially data was collected from Kathmandu valley including Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur. In the second phase we collected the data from all over Nepal. For the purpose of data collection, we included the following system of T&CM practices: Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Naturopathy, Acupuncture and Amchi(Sowa Rigpa). Herbal medicine centers were excluded from the study. For assessing information about availability of the services on those centers, a semi structured questionnaire was designed. Similarly, for location information Garmin GPS device was used. The majority of complementary medicine centers were practicing Ayurveda followed by Homeopathy. The third most practiced system was Acupuncture. Acupuncture was mostly practiced in conjunction with Ayurveda or Naturopathy. Amchi was least practiced system in Nepal. A rigorous research on challenges and opportunity and identify gaps associated with Ayurveda and Complementary Medicine practices will assist in future development of this system.ACRONYMS AYUS H Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy DAHC District Ayurvedic Health Center ERB Ethical Review Board GIS Geographical Information System GPS General Positioning System NCCIH National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health NHIS National Health Interview Survey NHRC Nepal Health Research Council SPSS Statistical Package for Social Science T&CM Traditional & Complementary Medicine TCM Traditional Chinese Medicine ZAD Zonal Ayurvedic Dispensary V Mapping the availability of Ayurveda and other Complementary Medicine Services Centers in Nepal1 Mapping the availability of Ayurveda and other Complementary Medicine Services Centers in NepalBackground World Health Organization (WHO) defines Traditional Medicine as \"the sum total of the knowledge, skills and practices based on the theories, beliefs and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health, as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illnesses \"[1, 2]. Traditional and Complementary Medicine(T&CM) comprises of wide spectrum of practices to prevent and cure diseases [3]. The terms like complementary, alternative, non-conventional medicine are homogenously used in different countries in reference to traditional medicine[2, 4, 5].The classification of practices and definitions of Traditional Medicine varies in different countries depending on the availability, accessibility, cultural and historical significance, and regulations [1,5]. National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)groups T&CM practices into seven broad categories that include natural products,traditional healers ,Ayurvedic medicine , Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), mainstreamed theAYUSH(Ayurveda, Yoga &Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy) system of medicine as scientifically accepted indigenous medicine with a view to put forward increased attention for its educational and research development[7]. In Nepal T&CM is implied as Ayurveda and Alternative medicine. National Health Policy 2074 defines other Alternative system as Yoga, Naturopathy, Sowa Rigpa, Homeopathy, Unani, Traditional Chinese Medicine, and other traditional medicine and practices. National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), 2002states that at least one third of adults use Complementary and Alternative Therapy worldwide[8]. A survey on popularity index by WHO showed that Ayurveda, Herbal medicine, Unani, Siddha, Yoga, Spiritual therapy are mostly practiced and popular in South East Asia Region [9]. More than two third of the population in Nepal relies on traditional practices for the primary health care, primarily due to the its accessibility, affordability and its alignment with cultural practices [10, 11]. There are estimated at least 400,000 traditional medicinal practitioners in Nepal practicing different modalities like ritual or ceremonial practices, spiritual practices, diet and self-healing [4] Like in most of the developing countries, despite the dependency of huge population on T&CM, there is lack of reliable information of availability of these facilities [12]. Information on the availability and accessibility of such services will help the service users to locate the chose appropriate T&CM facilities for their health care needs. Creation of health care centers database and mapping also helps to show the spatial distribution and information about location. Mapping can be used to illustrate the information on service provisions, understanding localities, and analysis and display of information. The History of mapping as a healthcare tool dates back to more than 150 years initially used by Dr. Robert Cowan, by showing the positive association of fever to the overcrowded areas[13, 14]. Since then, use of mapping in healthcare has been in upward trend; either to study the causative factor, mortality rate [13] or accessibility of health facilities among the population group. GIS provides tool for instant visualization of the information to the public on the accessibility as well as the expertise of identified and categorized health facilities.[15]. INTRODUCTION2Mapping the availability of Ayurveda and other Complementary Medicine Services Centers in NepalIn many parts of the developing countries, Traditional system of medicine remains the primary source of health care. As stated earlier, two third of the population in Nepal use Traditional and Complementary System of Medicine. However, there is very limited knowledge about the availability of institutions providing T&CM services. Information on what health conditions do patients usually consult for at T&CMs,type of services T&C Moffer, number of T&CM providing institutions in Nepal would be beneficial to policy makers, service seekers. In addition, there is limited knowledge on the documentation and recognition of suitable and effective practicesbecause of limited researches in T&CM in Nepalas a result, intended benefits of T&CM are still not validated. . Furthermore, providing reliable information on access to services providers could be the foundation to establishing of T&CM and future researches.RATIONALE3 Mapping the availability of Ayurveda and other Complementary Medicine Services Centers in NepalGeneral objective This study aims to generate the evidence on the availability of Traditional and Complementary service facilities through GIS mapping to provide a complete picture of spatial distribution of facilitiesin Nepal. Specific Objectives The specific objectives of the study are: 1. To assess the availability of Ayurveda and other complementary services providing institutions. 2. To assess the services provided by Ayurveda and other complementary medicine services providing institutions. 3. To map the location of Ayurveda and other complementary services providing institutions.OBJECTIVES4Mapping the availability of Ayurveda and other Complementary Medicine Services Centers in NepalStudy Design: This was a cross-sectional descriptive study carried out in Nepal. Semi structured interviews were carried out with the supervisors of the District Ayurvedic Health Center (DAHC)/ Zonal Ayurvedic Dispensary (ZAD) to obtain the information on the Ayurveda and other Complementary Medicine centers operating in that particular district. Sampling All the supervisors of DAHC / ZAD were approached to obtain details of all the registered and non- registered Ayurveda and other Complementary Medicine Centers. There are 75 District Ayurvedic Hospital / Zonal Ayurvedic Hospital throughout Nepal. Study site and its justification The study was initially conducted inside Kathmandu valley including Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur. Kathmandu Valley was initially selected for the study because there is wide spectrum of T&CM practices within Kathmandu Valley as compared to the rural areas. Later, with the plan to conduct the study in Nepal, we approached 75 District Ayurvedic Health Center(DAHC)/ Zonal Ayurvedic Dispensary(ZAD) in Nepal. DAHC/ZAD was approached as.It was considered necessary to have at least baseline information on the availability of Ayurveda and other Complementary System that is being practiced in Nepal. For the purpose of data collection, we included the following system of T&CM practices: Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Naturopathy, Acupuncture and Amchi(Sowa Rigpa). Herbal medicine centers were excluded from the study. Data collection tools/techniques We used two different techniques for data collection for Kathmandu Valley and all over Nepal. In the Kathmandu Valley: The initial list of service providers inside Kathmandu Valley was obtained from company registrar's website.Department of Ayurveda was approached for another set of list for the completeness and updated information on the service providers. After both the lists was compiled, field investigators, visited the listed facility and they also inquired if they knew any other Traditional Medicine Center in that area. This method ensured that the possibility of missing any centers was relatively low. The co-investigators and other field staff collected the data through interviews and questionnaires with the representative of the institution. On approaching the center, enumerators located latitude and longitude of the center through GPS device. Data was collected regarding type of service based on the information provided by institution. For assessing information about availability of the types of services in the centers, a semi structured questionnaire was designed. Similarly, for location information Garmin GPS device was used. The duration of the study was of 3 months. Field staffs with academic background in public health or nursing were selected for data collection. METHODOLOGY5 Mapping the availability of Ayurveda and other Complementary Medicine Services Centers in NepalThey were trained on data collection tool & technique and provided with data collection manuals and forms. Also, field supervisor checked theaccuracy and quality of data collection in each district. Arc Gis 10.2 was used to locate the latitude and longitude of the institutions. The administrative map of Kathmandu Bhaktapur and Lalitpur from the local government was used as the base map. For the ease of data collection, the places were divided into clusters. Kathmandu was divided into 13 clusters. Lalitpurand Bhaktapur were considered as one cluster each.GIS software was used for institutional mapping. Within Nepal For the data collection outside of Kathmandu Valley, we first approached Department of Ayurveda for the list and contact information of District/Zonal Ayurvedic Centers of Nepal. After we obtained the contact information from them we approached the supervisors/ Doctors of District Ayurvedic Health Center for the details information on the Ayurvedic and other Complementary Medicine Centers operating in that district. After the details of the study had been explained to the representative of the DAHC/ZAD over the telephone, we then sent the semi structured interview form through the email. The details of the all the centers operating in that particular district was obtained from the representatives of DAHC/ZAD. The reason to approach DAHC/ZAD was that all the centers are required to register their structural and service information in their corresponding DAHC/ZAD. Data Analysis The data were entered inepi-data initially and were transferred into SPSS version 16 for data analysis. Descriptive presentation was done using SPSS. Frequency and percentage were calculated for the categorical values. Ethical Consideration Ethical approval to conduct the study was obtained from Nepal Health Research Council (NHRC)- Ethical Review Board (ERB). The co-investigators and other field staff collected the data through interviews and questionnaires with the representative of the institution. Separate ethical approval was obtained to conduct the study within the valley and all over Nepal The objectives, methods, risks and benefit, need of this study, expected outcome of this research were well explained to all the participants. Participants were given choice to fill the questionnaires themselves or, if they wished, data collectors interviewed the participants to obtain the relevant information. Rights of the participants not to answer any of the questions or to withdraw from the study at any point of time were respected.6Mapping the availability of Ayurveda and other Complementary Medicine Services Centers in NepalFindings from the study: We approached representatives of District Ayurvedic Health Center/Zonal Ayurvedic Dispensaries DAHC/ZAD of all 75 districts and explained all the risk and benefits of the studied and mailed the questionnaire on the provided mail. We at least had a three follow -up calls to reach them. Out of 75 DAHC/ZAD we were able to collect the information from 68centers. There was no response from 7 DAHCs; hence we excluded the centers from those corresponding districts from the study. The findings from the information provided by the representatives of DAHC/ZAD are presented further .

There are three institutionsmore than 100 years old owned by the Government. Five of the centers were more than 50 years old in which four are Ayurvedic centers and one is Homeopathy clinic. Most of the centers establishedin last five years. Condition for which patients mostly visited for: The most common diseases for which the patients visited areGastritis, Piles and Fistula. Other common conditions for which the patient visited frequently were Rheumatoid Arthritis , Neurological Problems, Migraine, Skin disease, Depression and Anxiety, Diabetes, Hypertension, Gynecological disorder Of all the commonly treated diseases in Ayurveda and other system, most were reported chronic and non communicable diseases. Registration Status: Of the entire private, semi- government, NGO and community institutions; 113 institutions were reported to have registered with either DAHC/ZAD. 40 institutions reported that their institutions have been registered at least with one of the following authority; Department of Drug and & Administration, Company Registrar, Gharelutatha Sana Udhyog. A large number of institutions (163) did not provide the information on the status of registration.

Other common issue reported was that they did not have good infrastructure to provide all 15 Mapping the availability of Ayurveda and other Complementary Medicine Services Centers in Nepalthe necessary treatments. Some mentioned that patient come for the treatment after the disease has advanced so it is difficult to cure such patients and especially when the patients seek the guaranteed treatment. Other issues faced were Patients seeking guaranteed treatment, delayed in the healing to cure the disease, lack of public knowledge and belief in traditional medicine, Need of Government focus of Ayurveda and other traditional medicine. Some of the Naturopathy Hospitals reflected on the need of Naturopathy College and Government Hospital to build skilled manpower for the system. 16 Mapping the availability of Ayurveda and other Complementary Medicine Services Centers in NepalThere is a wide variety of T&CM practices in Nepal. Study revealed that Ayurveda is the most practiced T&CM system practices in Nepal followed by Homeopathy. Ayurveda has a long history of practices in Nepal. The oldest of the T&CM institutions are century old 3 Ayurvedic Centers owned by the Government of Nepal. Most of the Government institutions practicing T&CM in Nepal were the Ayurvedic Centers. However there were no Government entities that practiced Naturopathy and Amchi System. Acupuncture was commonly practiced in combination with Ayurveda or Naturopathy as an adjuvant therapy in most centers. T&CM practices in Nepal were commonly by qualified and registered doctors in their respective system there werealso practices were done by the registered assistants with diploma or certificate degrees.CONCLUSION17 Mapping the availability of Ayurveda and other Complementary Medicine Services Centers in NepalCreate nationaland province level information of different types of T&CM practices that can be available to the public would be useful in bringing all traditional system under single umbrella where they could be recognized, regulated and connected with each other to deliver better impact on population health in Nepal. Influence of Complementary medicine is considerably high; however there are very less scientific studies to show the value of individual therapies convincingly. There is a need todevelop conceptual models or frameworks for each system, create definite regulations policies, planning, and building network infrastructure required for the overall developments of all the existing T&CM in Nepal. A rigorous research byexploring barriers and challenges faced by the complementary medicine practitioner and opportunitiesahead will identify the gaps and helps to assist the fill those gaps. Further, there is a growing demand for complementary medicine with the burgeoning morbidity and mortality of Non-communicable Diseases. Many patients seek complementary medicine along with the conventional medicine for the treatment of Non-communicable Diseases. In this scenario research on identifying the main scientific, policy, and practice issues related to CAM research and explores and translates of validated therapies into conventional medical practice to reduce burden of Disease due to Chronic Non-Communicable disease is very crucial.
