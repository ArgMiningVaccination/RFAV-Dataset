Introduction The Federal Trade Com mission (\"Com mission\") has accepted, subject to final approval, an Ag reement Containing Consent Orde rs (\"Consent Ag reement\") w ith Pfiz er Inc. (\" Pfizer\"), which is desig ned to re medy the anticompetitive ef fects of its proposed ac quisiti on of Wy eth. Under the terms of the Con sent Agreement, Pfizer must divest to Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica , Inc. (\" BI\") Wy eth's U.S. animal hea lth business (\"For t Dodg e\") in all are as of overla p, except for e quine tapew orm para siticides and equine he rpesvirus equine tapewor m para siticides, the consent orde r requires Pfizer to return to Vir bac S.A. (\"Virbac \") Pfizer's e xclusive distribution rights for BI Pfizer's equine he rpesvirus pr oducts. The assets for each of the divestitures include all of the relevant intellectual property, customer lists, research and deve lopment information, and re gulatory materia ls, as well as two of F ort Dodg e's three U.S. manufac turing facilities. These divestitures fully prese rve the competition that the proposed a cquisition would otherwise eliminate. The propose d Consent Ag reement has bee n place d on the public re cord f or thirty days for receipt of comm ents by interested persons. Com ments received during this period will become part of the public rec ord. Afte r thirty days, the Commis sion will aga in review the proposed Consent Ag reement and the c omments rece ived to decide whether it should wit hdraw from the proposed Consent Ag reement, modify it, or make fina l the acc ompany ing D ecision and O rder (\"Order\"). Pursuant to an Ag reement and Plan of Mer ger da ted as of January 25, 2009, Pfiz er proposes to ac quire a ll of the issued and outstanding share s of Wy eth, wher eby each outstanding share of Wy eth common stock will be conve rted into the rig ht to rece ive $33 in cash a nd 0.985 share of Pfizer common stock. B oth parties manuf actur e human a nd animal hea lth biological and phar mace utical produc ts. The combined f irm would have pr ojected w orldwide re venues of almost $72 billion. The Com mission's complaint alleges that the proposed acquisition, if consummated, would violate Sec tion 7 of the Clay ton Act, as a mended, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 18, and Section 5 of the F ederal Tra de Commissi on Act, as a mended, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45, in U.S. markets for the manufacture and sale of: (1) killed cattle respiratory vaccines; (2) mod ified-live cattle respiratory vaccines; (3) cattle reproductive vaccines; (4) cattle pasteurella vaccines; (6) mastitis t reatments; (7) dairy cattle br oad- spectrum a ntibioti cs with low milk-withholding times; (8) benzim combination vaccines; (15) fe line combination vaccines; (16) feline leukemia vaccines; (17) companion animal rabies vaccines; c ed violations by repla eac h of the re levant marke ts the lost competition t hat would re sult from the ac quisiti on. II. The Pr oducts and Structure of the Markets The propose d acquisition of Wy eth by Pfizer would combine two of the la rgest animal health suppliers in the United States. The companies overlap in several animal health markets, and, if c onsummated, the transa ction likely would lead to anticompe titive cts in eac h of spec the transa ction would ease the suppliers in the overla p marke ts, which number ha s a direc t and substantial eff ect on the pr ices of animal he alth products. The evidenc e shows that customer s are able to obtain lower price s by threa tening to switch to another supplier or prese nting the inc umbent supplier with a riva l's lower offer. Cus tomers have stated that they generally can negotiate lower prices in markets with more par ticipants and that, historically , they have se en pric es rise in mar kets in which the number of ma rket pa rticipants has de clined. Pfizer and For t Dodg e are the mar ket leade rs in the ar ea of cattle he alth products. Af ter the transa ction, Pfiz er would have ove r 60 per cent of sever al of the r eleva nt cattle produc t markets. In the cattle vaccines area, Pfizer and Fort Dodge have broad and significantly overlapping portfolios of respiratory, reproductive, and pasteurella vaccines. Cus tomers choose the specific vaccine products that most closely match their needs based on several factors, including, among others, disease risk assessments and relative prices. Killed cattle r espirator y vacc ines preve nt respira tory diseases in pre gnant ca ttle without the risk of c ausing abortion. Pfizer and F ort Dodg e account for ove r 50 per cent of all killed respira tory vacc ine sales in the United States. The most commonly used killed respira tory vaccine is the 5-wa y vacc ine, which pr events infe ctious bovine rhinotrac heitis, ty pes 1 and 2 of bovine virus diarr hea, pa rainflue nza 3, and bovine re spiratory syncytial virus. As a re sult of the acquisition, Pfizer would have 61 percent of the market for killed 5-way respiratory vaccines, leaving Novar tis Animal Health (\"N ovartis\") as Pfizer's ines nt the same disea ses as killed re spiratory vaccines, but contain modified-live r ather than killed antig ens to stimulate gr eater protec tion. Because mod ified-live respiratory vaccines induce stronger immu nities, mos t customers gnant ca ttle. Pfiz er and For t Dodg e account for ove r 53 percent of a ll modified-live respira tory vacc ine sales in the United States. A s with kill ed respira tory vacc ines, the 5-wa y modified-live re spiratory vacc ine is the most commonly used modified-live cattle respiratory vaccine. As a result of the proposed acquisition, Pfizer would control over 68 percent of the 5-way mod ified-live respiratory vaccine market. Cattle reproductive vaccines are used to prevent early- and late-stage abortions in pregnant ca ines, killed vacc ines, which c ontain killed viral respira tory and Leptospira antigens; and (3) the market for lepto/vibrio vaccines, which contain To ensure that antibiotic-contaminate d milk is not distributed, the United States Food1 and Dr ug Administration (\"F DA\") has set \"w ithholding times\" for each antibiotic product and mandates tha t any milk that is produce d during the withholding pe riod be disca rded. A farmers in purc hasing antibiotics, theref ore, is how quickly they can resume milk production after treatment. 3Leptospira and Campylobacter fetus antig ens. Afte r the a cquisition, P fizer would have 83 percent of the $13 million mod ified-live 10-way market in the United States, with Intervet/Schering-Plough Ani mal Heal th (\"ISP\"), A griLaboratories, Ltd. (\"A griLabs\"), and BI accounting f or 11 per cent, 4 pe rcent, and 2 per cent, r espec tively . Pfiz er also would control 76 percent of sale s in kill ed 10-w ay vacc ines, leaving Novar tis with 18 percent a nd Ag riLabs with 6 percent of this $9 milli on marke t. Finally , in the lepto/vibrio ine marke Pfiz er and For t Dodg e collec tively account for almost 39 perc ent of this $2.6 milli on marke t, and Novar tis leads with 41 percent. Cattle pasteure lla vacc ines are used to preve nt pneumonia as we ll as lesser r espirator y infections in cows caused by Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia hae molytica bacte ria. Pfizer, Fort Dodge, BI, ISP, a nd Merial are the only significant suppliers of products in these marke ts in the United States. The propose d acquisition would reduc e the number of compe titors in these markets, leaving Pfizer significantly larger than any of its remaining competitors. Lactating- cow a nd dry -cow mastitis t reatments are use d to treat infe ctions of the udder that occur during either la ctation or the dr y period be tween pr egnancie s. The mar kets for lactating -cow ntrated, er and For t Dodg e tog ether accounting f or more tha n 90 perc ent of sale s in eac h of these ma rkets. Broad-spe ctrum antibiotic products with low milk-withholding times ca n be used to tre at a large variety of infections that affect dairy cows. Pfizer's products are considered the mos t1 effective a ntibioti cs for dairy cows a nd have a zero-day withholding per iod, while For t Dodg e's product ha s a low withholding pe riod of two to four da ys. A g eneric ver sion of one of Pfizer's products wa s recently introduced. A s a re sult of the proposed a cquisition, P fizer would have a near monopoly in this $162 million ma rket. Cattle macrocyclic lactone parasiticides are the newest and mos t effective class of cattle parasiticides in the United States. They are effective a gainst both internal and e xterna l para sites. There are only three brande d play ers in the $118 million U.S. market: Pfiz er, Fort Dodg e, and Merial. Although generic versions of Merial's product are available, there are no generic versions of Pfizer's or Fort Dodg e's pr oducts curr ently on the marke t. The propose d acquisition would significantly increase the concentration in this market, leaving Pfizer with approxima tely 42 percent of the market. Cattle benzim idazole parasiticides are an older generation of parasiticides used primarily by cattle br eeders to trea t internal par asites, such a s lungw orms, tapewor ms, and liver fluke s. Pfizer, Fort Dodge, and ISP are the only suppliers to offer cattle benzim idazole parasiticides in4the United States. After the proposed acquisition, ISP would be the only remaining constraint on Pfizer's ability to raise prices, accounting for 67 percent of this $16 million market. Pfizer would control the remaining 33 percent of the market. Beyond cattle health products, Pfizer and Fort Dodge are also two of only four major suppliers in the relevant companion animal vaccines and pharmaceuticals markets. In the majority of these markets, the transaction would reduce the number of competitors from four to three and give Pfizer between 50 and 100 percent of the market. As in the cattle vaccines area, Pfizer and Fort Dodge have broad and significantly overlapping portfolios of companion animal vaccines. Customers can choose the specific vaccine products that most closely match their needs based on several factors, including, among others, vaccination protocols recommended by veterinarians and disease risk assessments. Canine combination vaccines prevent common canine diseases, such as those caused by canine distemper, adenovirus (types 1 and 2), parainfluenza, parvovirus, coronavirus, and Leptospira . Pfizer, Fort Dodge, Merial, and ISP are the four significant companies that supply canine combination vaccines in the United States. Total U.S. sales of canine combination vaccines are $126 million. The proposed acquisition would reduce the number of significant suppliers of canine combination vaccines from four to three. While parvovirus, coronavirus, and leptospira vaccines are all available as part of canine combination vaccines, the monovalent forms are administered as booster shots for puppies that have a particularly high risk of exposure to the disease. Pfizer, Fort Dodge, Merial, and ISP are the only four companies that supply canine monovalent parvovirus vaccines in the United States, a $2.1 million market. The proposed acquisition would give Pfizer control of 66 percent of the canine monovalent parvovirus vaccine market. The same four players Pfizer, Fort Dodge, Merial, and ISP are also the only four companies that supply canine monovalent coronavirus vaccines in the United States. The proposed acquisition would further entrench Pfizer as the dominant supplier with an 81 percent share of the $2.3 million market for canine monovalent coronavirus vaccines. In the market for canine monovalent leptospira vaccines, the proposed acquisition would combine the only two companies that currently supply such vaccines in the United States. Pfizer currently has a 53 percent share, and Fort Dodge controls the remaining 47 percent of this $9.2 million market. The proposed acquisition would grant Pfizer complete control over the market for canine monovalent leptospira vaccines. Canine bordetella vaccines are used primarily to prevent infectious tracheobronchitis, which is the most prevalent upper respiratory infection contracted by dogs in the United States. There are five suppliers of canine bordetella vaccines in the United States: Pfizer, Fort Dodge, ISP, Merial, and BI. Total U.S. sales of canine bordetella vaccines amount to $53.3 million. The proposed acquisition would reduce the number of suppliers of canine bordetella vaccines from five to four, leaving Pfizer significantly larger than its three remaining competitors. 5Feline combination vacc ines are used to preve nt common feline disea ses, such a s feline panleukope nia, rhinotrac heitis, chlamy dia, and c alicivirus. Pfizer, For t Dodg e, ISP, and Merial are the only significant suppliers of feline combination vaccines in the United States. Total U.S. sales of f eline combination vac cines a re $28 million. The proposed a cquisition would reduce the number of sig nificant suppliers of feline c ombination vaccine s from four to three, w ith Pfiz er's sales considerably greater than those of its two remaining competitors. Feline leukemia va ccine s can pr ovide ef fective protec tion ag ainst feline leuke mia, a fa tal disease tha t brea ks down a c at's immune sy stem to such an extent that it can no long er de fend against otherwise ha rmless invasions by bacte ria, viruse s, or other sour ces of disease. Pfizer, Fort Dodg e, Mer ial, and I SP are the only companies tha t supply feline le ukemia vac cines in the United States, sales of w hich ar e $38 million. The proposed a cquisition would reduce the number of supplier s from four to three, w ith Pfiz er sig nificantly larger tha n its two remaining competitors. Com panion animal rabies vaccines are used to prevent rabies, a fatal and incurable neurolog ical disea se. Pfizer, For t Dodg e, Mer ial, and I SP are the only companies tha t offer companion animal r abies va ccine s in the United States. U.S. sales of such va ccine s total approximately $60 milli on, and the pr oposed ac quisiti on would reduc e the number of suppliers of compa nion animal rabie s vacc ines from four to three. Companion animal cepha losporins are a recent g eneration of broa d-spec trum antibiotics that are effective against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms and can be used to treat a wide r ange of infe ctions. Pfiz er and For t Dodg e are the only two suppliers of bra nded companion animal c ephalosporins in the United States. The only other c ompanion animal cepha losporins are g eneric human and a nimal cepha losporin products. These products, howe ver, have limited sig nificanc e bec ause of dosing diff erences f ound in the g eneric human products and a relative lack of technica l and re search support off ered with the g eneric animal products. As a result of the pr oposed ac quisiti on, Pfiz er would have 70 pe rcent of this $52 milli on marke t. In addition to cattle and c ompanion animal produc ts, the proposed a cquisition also poses praziquantel consists of produc ts used to treat tape worms and other internal pa rasites, whic h are the leading cause of equine colic in the United States. Curre ntly, Pfiz er ha s a 33 per cent sha re of this approxi mately $22 milli on marke ent share; nd Merial has a pe rcent market shar e. The proposed a cquisition would give Pfizer 64 pe rcent of the for equine tapewor Equine her pesvirus vac cines a re use d primarily for the pr evention of e quine rhinopneumonitis, an upper r espirator y disease, w hich ca n cause abortion in preg nant mare s. Pfizer, Fort Dodg e, ISP, and BI are the only suppliers of equine herpe svirus vacc ines in the United States, sales of w hich total $30 milli on. The propose d acquisition would reduc e the6number of suppliers from four to three, with Pfizer significantly larger than its two remaining competitors. Equine joint-injected steroids can be used to reduce joint inflammation, treat osteoporosis, and prevent lameness in horses. Pfizer has a 60 percent share of this $7.3 million market, while Fort Dodge has a 40 percent share. The proposed acquisition would create a monopoly in the market for equine joint-injected steroids in the United States. III. Entry Entry into the manufacture and sale of the relevant animal health vaccine and pharmaceutical markets would not be timely, likely, or sufficient in its magnitude, character, or scope to deter or counteract the anticompetitive effects of the proposed acquisition. Developing and obtaining United States Department of Agriculture approval (in the case of vaccines) for the manufacture and sale of each of the relevant products can take as many as five years due to substantial regulatory, technological, and intellectual property barriers. Similarly, obtaining FDA approval (in the case of pharmaceutical products) can take five to seven years for a currently developed product and as many as ten or more years for an entirely new product. In addition to the regulatory, developmental, and manufacturing hurdles facing a potential entrant, many of the markets at issue are characterized by particular conditions that make new entry unlikely. For example, some products, such as vaccines for cattle, equine, and companion animals, are particularly difficult to manufacture, have relatively small profit opportunities, and have a high potential for adverse reactions and product failure. In other markets, such as those for companion animal vaccines, a substantial initial investment is necessary because veterinarians tend to purchase all their vaccines from a single supplier; as a result, a new entrant must develop a large portfolio of vaccines in order to be a significant competitor. IV. Effects of the Acquisition The proposed acquisition would cause significant competitive harm to consumers in the relevant U.S. markets for cattle, companion animal, and equine health products by eliminating actual, direct, and substantial competition between Pfizer and Wyeth. The transaction would increase the likelihood that Pfizer will be able to unilaterally exercise market power, increase the likelihood of coordinated interaction between or among suppliers, reduce Pfizer's incentives to pursue further research and development, and increase the likelihood that consumers will pay higher prices. In each of the relevant markets, the evidence shows that consumers have experienced lower prices, increased research and development, and better service due to the competitive rivalry that exists between market participants particularly that which currently exists between Pfizer and Wyeth. The evidence also shows that, when any of the competitors experienced supply problems, the remaining competitors increased their prices, and, conversely, that consumers were able to negotiate lower prices when new rivals entered the relevant markets.7V. The Consent Agreement The proposed Co nsent Agreement preserves competition in each of the relevant markets alleg ed in the complaint by requiring that Pfiz er dive st the following a ssets to BI no later tha n ten day s after the ac quisiti on: all of the F ort Dodg e asse ts relating to killed cattle re spiratory vaccines, mod ified-live cattle respiratory vaccines, cattle reproductive vaccines, cattle pasteure lla ines, cattle br oad-spe with low par vovirus vaccines, canine mon ovalent coronavirus vaccines, ovalent vaccines, canine bordete vacc ines, vaccine s, joint-injected ster oids, as well as the Pfizer assets relating to equine herpesvirus vaccines. The propose d Consent Ag reement contains seve ral provisions desig ned to ensure that these d ivestitures are s ucces sful. Pfizer must provide var ious transitional services to enable BI to compete a gainst Pfiz er immediate ly following the ac quisiti on, including a ny technica l assistance that BI may need. Pfizer a lso must provide BI with the reg ulatory approva ls, brand names, mar keting materia ls, customer contra cts, and other assets assoc iated with marke ting a nd selling the divested products in the United States. BI is a reputa ble supplier of a nimal health produc ts and is well positioned to manufactur e and mar ket the divested a ssets and to compete effectively in the rele vant marke ts. In the United States, BI 's animal hea lth revenue s totaled approximately $215 milli on in 2008. Moreover , the acquisition by BI does not present competitive problems in any of the relevant markets because it currently has either a very limited presence or no presence at all in each of those areas. With its resources, capabilities, and experience marketing animal and human health products, BI is well place d to replica te the compe tition t hat would be lost with the proposed a cquisition. The propose d Consent Ag reement also prese rves the equine tapeworm parasiticides market by requiring Pfizer to return to Virbac Pfizer's distribution rights for the r eleva nt para siticide products no later than ten day s after the ac quisiti on. I n 2000, Virbac enter ed into a 15-y ear licensing agreement with Pfiz er, unde r which V irbac grants Pfizer exclusive distribut ion rig hts to market and se ll the equine tape worm par asiticide produc ts in the United States. Virbac is particularly well suited to acquire these assets because it currently manufa cture s the products a nd has the re source s, technica l capa biliti es, and e xperie nce to be successful in restoring the competition that would be lost if the proposed Pfizer/Wyeth transac tion were to proce ed unre medied. If the Commission determines that either B I or Virba c is not an ac cepta ble ac quirer of the assets to be divested, or that the manner of the divestitures is not ac cepta ble, Pfizer must unwind the sale( s) and divest the a ssets within six months of the date the O rder become s final to another Commi ssion-approve d acquir er. If Pfizer fails to divest within the six months, the Comm ission may appoint a trustee to divest the releva nt assets. 8The propose d reme dy also allows for the appointment of an I nterim Trustee , experience d in obtaining r egulatory approva l and the manuf actur e of biolog ics, to overse e the r equire d technolog y transfe rs. As par t of the propose d reme dy, Pfiz er is re quired to execute a n agreement confe rring all rig hts and power s nece ssary for the I nterim Trustee to satisfy his responsibiliti es under the Orde r to assure succe ssful divestitures. The Commission has appointed Dr. Stephen J.D. Bell of Tunnell Co nsulting to be the Interim Mo nitor and it is anticipated that he will obtain support and assistanc e from his colleag ue, Mr. Ar lo Mill en. The monitors will ensure that the Com mission remains informed about the status of the proposed divestitures and asset transfers. The purpose of this analy sis is t o fac ilitate public comment on the proposed Consent Agreement, and it is not int ended to c onstitut e an of ficial interpr etation of the pr oposed Consent Agreement or to modify its terms in any way.
