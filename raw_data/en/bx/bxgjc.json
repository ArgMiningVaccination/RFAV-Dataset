This is a review for alternative medicine in Los Angeles, CA: \"Dr G is the best doc I have seen. He really genuinely cares about you and your health. From the first I met him and his staff I have always felt assured that he wanted the best for me. His knowledge of both western and alternative medicine is incredible. I feel better that I have in years and has helped me turn a potentially life threatening disease from dominating my life to it be greatly reduced. I am still working with Dr G and will continue to do so even after there are no more symptoms. Thank you Dr G and all the staff "}
