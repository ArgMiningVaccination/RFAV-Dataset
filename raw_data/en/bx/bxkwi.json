Pellets Feed your rabbits a small amount of good quality pellets or nuggets daily. - Give them the right amount - measure 25g (an eggcup-full) of pellets per kg of your rabbit's body weight. For example, for a medium-sized rabbit (2kg), feed a maximum of two full egg cups. - Muesli-style foods aren't recommended for rabbits - see [why muesli is unhealthy for rabbits](/adviceandwelfare/pets/rabbits/diet/muesli)and learn how to slowly transfer your rabbits onto a healthier diet. Healthy treats You can use part of their daily ration of greens, pellets or nuggets as treats and rewards during training. Carrots and apples are fine as occasional treats in small amounts, but don't feed any other treats, as these may harm your rabbit.
