Some individuals experience seasonal allergies and typically suffer from hay fever symptoms; while others suffer from chronic, persistent allergies, which lead to a much more severe reaction to not only non-pathogenic allergens, but also pathogens. These individuals are also more susceptible to adverse reactions to vaccines, as their immune system has been weakened and reacts to the pathogen in an allergic manner. In TCM, we look at clearing blood heat, nurturing blood yin, and enhancing lung qi to combat this chronic illness. Chronic, Persistent Allergies: TCM Perspective Severe seasonal allergies are extremely consuming to the body's lung qi and blood yin, and can cause deficiencies of both. This can become more severe when the reaction occurs frequently, since the body's immune system function against the pathogen can become weakened. This allows the patient to become more susceptible to other germs, and these pathogens can't be removed promptly by the weakened immune system. Instead, they work as allergens and enable further uncontrolled allergies. Such chronic and persistent allergies easily evolve into a sinus, ear or upper respiratory infection since these allergens are pathogenic. Patients can also experience symptoms of a cough, post-nasal drip, sinus congestion, and excessive phlegm or mucus production in addition to the traditional hay fever symptoms. Allergies to Vaccines Vaccination generally involves injecting the body with killed or weakened disease-causing microorganisms that cause diseases. Some vaccines contain only a part of the disease germ. A vaccine is supposed to stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies, exactly like it would if a person was exposed to the disease. After the vaccination, the immune system will have a memory of the pathogen. When the pathogen is exposed next time, the immune system will be able to produce antibodies at high levels promptly to eradicate the pathogen and prevent the disease. Unfortunately, a patient who is suffering from chronic, persistent allergies has a weakened immune system, and a vaccine can also cause allergic reactions because it is new to the immune system. The allergic reaction varies from mild to very severe depending on the complexity of the pathogen. According to research in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, the COVID-19 vaccine can cause adverse allergic reactions in individuals who suffer from food and drug allergies. This is because these patients have a weakened immune system that overreacts to both pathogenic and non-pathogenic allergens. TCM Solutions TCM herbs that clear blood heat, nurture blood yin and enhance lung qi can help these patients tremendously. Herbs such as Bamusae caulis in Taeniam have been shown to inhibit airway inflammation, decrease levels of eosinophils and immune cell infiltration, as well as modulate inflammatory responses in the lungs.1 Moutan cortex has been shown to inhibit systemic anaphylactic shock and decrease levels of histamine.2 These two herbs combined can help to clear blood heat by removing the levels of inflammation and histamine, which are two major factors in an allergic response. Herbs such as Lonicerae japonicae flos have been shown to effectively improve immunity, increase macrophage count and enhance the secretion of Th1 cells.3 This herb also helps to decrease mast cell aggregation and degranulation.3 Rhizome atractylodis macrocephalae, a major qi-boosting herb, also has a positive effect on immune function through increasing CD4(+) T cell population and macrophage levels.4 Supporting the body's immune response by enhancing qi, and reducing unnecessary allergic reactions by cooling the blood and nurturing blood yin, herbal TCM formulas provide a strong option for the 50 million Americans suffering from allergies; especially for those who are severely suffering due to chronic, persistent allergies that can lead to vaccine reactions. A Case Study: Severe, Chronic Allergies Resolved A 50-year-old male was suffering from chronic allergies since he moved to California more than seven years ago. He was constantly sneezing, tearing up, and later on developed headaches and dizziness. During the seventh year, his nasal membrane had become so damaged from the eroding mucus produced by the immune system that he was using an entire roll of toilet paper to wipe his nose throughout the day. The regular bath tissue was too harsh for his nose because his nasal membrane was so fragile and the tissue could break his nasal membrane, causing bleeding. His tearing up was always present. The patient tried everything available on the market, even including a formula which removes blood heat for seasonal allergies at double the dosage, but without any results. The patient thought about moving out of California because he was suffering so terribly. The patient was recommended to take a formula that contains 21 herbal ingredients including Rhizome atractylodis macrocephalae and Bamusae caulis in Taeniam. The formula works to remove blood heat while also nurturing the blood yin and lung qi. After nine days of using the formula, he felt that his head had become a little numb and then all the symptoms had gone. In the next year's allergy season, he still had some allergic reactions with symptoms of rashes appearing on his chest. He then took three days' worth of the 21-herb formula and the rash cleared completely. During the following year's allergy season, he experienced some rashes on his lower legs, but several days of the 21-herb formula helped clear them again. The patient is very happy to have such a fast turnaround from his symptoms and to have been able to resolve his issues with the use of an all-natural herbal formula. References - Ra J, et al.
