Properly processing and disposing of regulated medical waste (RMW), biohazardous waste, and general waste is critical to ensure public safety. Laboratories, hospitals, military facilities, care centres, aircraft, ships and prisons are all sources of bio-hazardous waste. Each one of these facilities or sources requires a safe and sustainable solution to process the waste close to its source of origin. Eliminating pathogens, bacteria, viruses, fungi, spores and any other potentially harmful substances from entering the environment is critical. Our proprietary system is the industry-leading solution. Introducing The All-New Viking Ozone Technology VKIN-6000 The VKIN-6000 is a revolutionary advancement in the world of waste treatment. By combining our technology with the use of ozone, we offer an environmentally sustainable and cost-effective alternative to incineration, chemical treatment, autoclave and heat treatments for regulated medical waste, bio-hazardous waste and general waste. VKIN-6000 reduces the amount of energy required to process waste, which conserves resources, and operating costs and reduces greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in a cleaner, safer environment. Our modular design and low profile allow multiple configurations and savings for civil work at the site. Model Configuration VKIN-6000 features multiple configurations to best suit each customer's location and requirements. Contact our team to find the right fit for your project.
