Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a facultative intracellular pathogen that uses its type 3 secretion system 2 (T3SS2) to invade and replicate inside host cells. Analysis of the T3SS2 pathogenicity island encoding the T3SS2 appeared to lack a mechanism for egress of this bacterium from the invaded host cell. Using a combination of molecular tools, we found that VPA0226, a constitutively secreted lipase, is required for escape of V. parahaemolyticus from the host cells. This lipase must be delivered into the host cytoplasm where it preferentially uses fatty acids associated with innate immune response to esterify cholesterol, weakening the plasma membrane and allowing egress of the bacteria. This study reveals the resourcefulness of microbes and the interplay between virulence systems and host cell resources to evolve an ingenious scheme for survival and escape. Introduction As intracellular pathogens acquire mechanisms to invade a host cell, correlating mechanisms must also evolve for survival within the host and escape from the host. For example, the facultative intracellular pathogen Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a Gram-negative bacterium that resides in warm estuarine environments with some strains acquiring virulence factors that can cause illness, even death in animals including shrimp and humans ( [Wang et al., 2015](#bib67)). This pathogen can cause acute gastroenteritis due to the consumption of contaminated, undercooked seafood and possibly septicemia when infecting open wounds ( [Wang et al., 2015](#bib67)). V. parahaemolyticus contains a number of virulence factors, including hemolysins secreted via T2SS (Type 2 Secretion System) and 3 Secretion (T3SS1 and T3SS2) ( [Makino et al., 2003](#bib42)). T2SS is primarily involved in exporting folded proteins from the periplasm of most Gram-negative bacteria into extracellular environment and is a part of the widely conserved general secretory (Sec) pathway ( [Korotkov et al., et al., 2012](#bib20)). T2SS is a specialized multicomponent assembly that consists of four major components: an outer membrane secretin, an inner membrane channel, the pseudopilus and an ATPase al., 2020](#bib56)). T2SS secreted protein repertoire includes lipid and protein hydrolyzing enzymes, pore-forming toxins, phosphatases, nucleases, etc. that are implicated in plant, animal and human pathogenesis and widely present in both the T2SS ( [Matsuda et al., 2019](#bib44); [Sikora, 2013](#bib55)). Previous studies have shown that the more ancient T3SS1 is associated with all strains of V. parahaemolyticus, whereas T3SS2, a more recent acquisition, correlates with clinical isolates and disease in humans ( [Makino et al., 2003](#bib42)). To study the various virulence factors independently, deletions in particular genes are created to unmask the activity of a specific virulence mechanism ( [De Souza Santos and Orth, 2019](#bib19)). Herein, to study T3SS2, we utilize CAB2, a strain derived from the clinical isolate RIMD2210633 that is deleted for hemolysins and mutated for expression of the T3SS1 ( [Zhang et al., 2012](#bib68)). The T3SS2, found pathogenicity island encodes a needle-like apparatus and effectors that mediate an invasive infection resulting in host cell death ( [Zhang and VopC, a deamidase, to membrane ruffling and uptake of V. parahaemolyticus by nonphagocytic cells ( [Zhang et al., 2012](#bib68); Santos and Orth, 2014](#bib18)). Once inside, V. parahaemolyticus escapes from an acidified endocytic compartment and proceeds to replicate in the cytoplasm of the host cell, reaching counts of 200-300 bacteria per host cell ( [de Souza Santos and Orth, 2014](#bib18)). Other translocated effectors have been shown to manipulate host cell signaling, including the acetyltransferase VopA that blocks MAPK signaling and the actin assembly factor VopL that blocks production of reactive oxygen species ( [Trosky et al., 2004](#bib62); [Liverman 2007](#bib41); et al., 2017](#bib17); [Trosky et al., 2007](#bib63)). V. parahaemolyticus ultimately escapes from this protective replicative niche to infect other cells ( [de Souza Santos and Orth, 2014](#bib18)). In total, about a dozen T3SS2 effectors are thought to be delivered to the host cell, some with known molecular functions but with exception of the aforementioned effectors, understudied for their role in bacterial intracellular survival Souza Santos and Orth, 2019](#bib19)). After bioinformatic perusal of this pathogenicity island, there appeared to be no obvious candidate effector that would mediate the escape of V. parahaemolyticus from the endocytic compartment or the host cell. To be a successful pathogen, an intracellular bacterium must egress after its replication in the host cell cytosol to re-infect neighboring cells and disseminate into tissues. Pathogens use various mechanisms for egress, including programmed cell death, non-lytic exit of host cells and manipulation of host-cell-derived membranes ( [Hybiske and Stephens, 2015](#bib32); [Flieger et al., 2018](#bib22)). Three forms of programmed cell death that include both non-lytic (apoptosis) and lytic pathways (pyroptosis and necroptosis) pathogen egress. For pathogen egress via apoptosis as seen with M. tuberculosis and Leishmania species, the invaded host cells are programmed to die without inducing inflammation. Thus, the pathogens cause less damage to the host leading to their dissemination within apoptotic bodies only to be engulfed by scavenging macrophages induced by gasdermin in a caspase-dependent pathway, involves formation of pores in the plasma membrane and is used as an exit mechanism by Francisella, Legionella, Shigella, Salmonella Naderer, 2014](#bib61)). a programmed necrosis that is induced by the receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIP3/RIPK3) and the mixed lineage kinase domain like pseudokinase (MLKL) signaling pathway, is observed for dissemination of Salmonella and Mycobacterium species ( [Lindgren et al., exocytosis and expulsion ( [Hybiske and et 2018](#bib22); [Friedrich 2012](#bib26)) Parasites such as Trypanosoma, Plasmodium and Toxoplasma gondi use active host cell lysis mediated by proteases and lipases as exit strategy and Stephens, 2015](#bib32); [Pszenny et al., 2016](#bib51)). Herein, we describe a novel mechanism deployed by V. parahaemolyticus for its egress from the host cells. We show that the lipase, VPA0226 is necessary for egress of V. parahaemolyticus from its host cell initially invaded in a T3SS2-mediated mechanism. However, VPA0226 is not secreted by the T3SS2, but rather it is constitutively secreted by the type two secretion system. Using lipidomic studies we found that, unlike other bacterial lipases, cytoplasmic VPA0226, but not its catalytically cholesterol using host polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), specifically those implicated in immune signaling. Esterification of cholesterol leads to a weakened plasma membrane that allows V. parahaemolyticus to escape. Not only is this a novel mechanism that is using host-derived PUFA to esterify cholesterol for egress of an intracellular bacterial pathogen, this study exemplifies the resourcefulness and adaptability of bacteria to leverage an existing mechanism to survive and escape from a host cell. Results The catalytic activity of VPA0226 is required for V. parahaemolyticus egress from host cell Intracellular pathogens are known to use lipases to escape from membrane compartments. SseJ, a T3SS lipase/esterase effector of Salmonella spp. is known to modulate the Salmonella containing vacuole lipid composition ( [Ruiz-Albert et al., 2002](#bib53); [Fredlund and 2014](#bib24)). Using SseJ as a probe in a bioinformatic search of the V. parahaemolyticus genome, we identified a lipase (VPA0226) with approximately 16% sequence identity and conservation of catalytic residues ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A](/articles/58057/figures#fig1s1)). Previously, in vitro studies demonstrated that VPA0226 has lipase activity and structural studies on a related vulnificus lipase revealed [Shinoda et al., 1991](#bib54)). However, analysis of VPA0226 reveals a more classic catalytic triad of Ser-His-Asp ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B](/articles/58057/figures#fig1s1)). To test whether a critical role in V. parahaemolyticus' intracellular lifecycle, we performed a gentamicin protection assay, whereby HeLa cells were infected with the V. parahaemolyticus CAB2 strain for 2 hr to allow invasion of the host, followed by treatment with gentamicin for the remainder of the infection to kill all extracellular, but not intracellular bacteria ( [de Souza Santos and Orth, 2014](#bib18)). We observed that the V. parahaemolyticus CAB2 containing a functional T3SS2 can efficiently invade, replicate (indicated by the increase in colony-forming units (CFU)), and escape from the host cell (indicated by the after-peak decrease in CFU due to exposure of egressed bacteria to gentamicin) ( [Figure 1A](#fig1), black bars). By contrast, a CAB2 strain deleted for vpa0226 (CAB2vpa0226) results in cells that have increasing amounts of bacteria with no significant decrease for up to 7 hr post-gentamicin treatment (PGT), indicating the inability of these bacteria to escape from an invaded cell ( [Figure 1A](#fig1), green bars). [see all](/articles/58057/figures#fig1) To test whether cell egress was attributed to VPA0226's catalytic activity, we complemented the CAB2vpa0226 with a wildtype copy of VPA0226 in-trans complementation with a wildtype copy of VPA0226 allowed for bacterial escape, the catalytically inactive form of VPA0226 did not allow for egress of V. parahaemolyticus from the host cell. ( [Figure 1B](#fig1)). Furthermore, the decrease in number of lysed host cells, as well as the decreased number of egressed mutant bacteria at 7 hr PGT in comparison to its parental strain is consistent with these findings ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C and D](/articles/58057/figures#fig1s1), respectively). Similarly, when Caco-2 cells were infected with V. parahaemolyticus strains, CAB2vpa0226 or CAB2vpa0226+S/A were unable to escape from invaded cells at 7 hr PGT, in contrast to the egress-competent CAB2 and CAB2vpa0226+WT turned to confocal microscopy and observed over the course of an infection that only CAB2 and CAB2vpa0226+WT, but not CAB2vpa0226 and CAB2vpa0226+S/A, escape from the host cell 7 hr PGT ( [Figure 1C and D](#fig1)). These results support the previous observation that, in the absence of VPA0226, bacteria are unable to egress from their host cell. To further confirm that decrease in bacterial counts observed at 7 hr PGT in CAB2 or CAB2vpa0226+WT invaded HeLa cells is not caused by gentamicin from the medium ultimately reaching intracellular bacteria, we performed an extended time course gentamicin protection assay in which HeLa cells were infected with V. parahaemolyticus strains for 2 hr, treated with gentamicin at 100 \u00b5g/ml for 1 hr and then changed to 10 \u00b5g/ml for the remainder of the assay. As observed previously, HeLa cells invaded with CAB2vpa0226 or CAB2vpa0226+S/A strains still contained viable bacteria even at 12 hr PGT in contrast to CAB2 or CAB2vpa0226+WT invaded HeLa cells that had no viable bacteria from 8 hr PGT onwards ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A and B](/articles/58057/figures#fig1s2)). Interestingly, at 24 hr PGT, no viable bacteria were present in HeLa cells under any conditions and majority of the HeLa cells appeared rounded and dying ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B](/articles/58057/figures#fig1s2)). VPA0226 is secreted by the type two secretion system We initially speculated that VPA0226 is translocated as a T3SS effector, as it appears that VPA0226 is essential for V. parahaemolyticus's egress from the host cell when the bacterium leads a T3SS2-dependent intracellular life cycle ( [Zhang et al., 2012](#bib68)). To test this hypothesis, we followed the secretion of VPA0226 from various V. parahaemolyticus strains, including CAB2, CAB2vpa0226, CAB3 (a strain that only contains the T3SS1), and CAB4 (a strain that contains neither T3SS1 nor T3SS2). To our surprise, with the exception of the CAB2vpa0226 strain, we observed VPA0226 to be constitutively secreted from all of these V. strains ( 2A](#fig2)). Further bioinformatic analysis using SignalP5.0 that VPA0226 contained a signal peptide at its N-terminus similar to those found for enzymes that are secreted out of the type two secretion system ( [Banerji et al., 2005](#bib4); To whether VPA0226 is secreted through this system, we assayed the following strains for VPA0226 secretion: CAB2; CAB2vpa0226; a CAB2 strain deleted for EpsD (an essential type two secretion system outer membrane component), CAB2epsD; and the EpsD complemented strain CAB2epsD+EpsD. We observed that VPA0226 is secreted or ( [Figure 2B](#fig2)). As we did not observe VPA0226 in the pellet fraction of CAB2epsD, we performed qPCR analysis to confirm the expression of VPA0226 in CAB2epsD strain and observed a significant reduction in the expression level of VPA0226 in CAB2epsD compared to CAB2 ( [Figure overexpressed VPA0226 through a plasmid in CAB2epsD, we observed a slightly higher migrating band corresponding to the uncleaved version of VPA0226 in the pellet fraction along with a few other lower migrating bands indicating possible degradation of VPA0226 ( [Figure 2D](#fig2)). Taken together, these above results demonstrate that VPA0226 is secreted by the of invaded cells Since VPA0226 is predicted to be a lipase that hydrolyses fatty acids of phospholipids and can transfer fatty acids to cholesterol, we speculated that VPA0226 would be associated with a host membrane as it appears to be involved in bacterial egress from the host cell through this membrane. To test this hypothesis, we transiently transfected VPA0226 tagged with GFP (VPA0226-GFP) into HeLa cells and observed that cells expressing VPA0226-GFP died within 24 hr (data not shown); however, at an earlier time point (14 hr), the transfected cells were viable. Somewhat perplexing, VPA0226-GFP was not localized to the plasma membrane but to an intracellular membrane compartment ( [Figure 3A](#fig3)). To assess which compartment this might be, we co-stained transfected cells with markers for a number of intracellular compartments, including early endosomes were ACAT1 and transfected the morphology of the mitochondria also occurred during infection, as host cells invaded with the CAB2 strain revealed similar fragmented mitochondria at approximately [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E](/articles/58057/figures#fig3s1)). Cells that do not contain bacteria appear to have normal mitochondria ( [Figure 3B and C](#fig3), infected with CAB2vpa0226 strain exhibit normal mitochondrial morphology the transfection studies, mitochondrial fragmentation was dependent on the intact catalytic of ( [Figure 3B and C](#fig3), [Figure only saw changes in mitochondria when VPA0226 is provided by an intracellular source (invaded or transfected cells), we conclude that VPA0226 must be supplied intracellularly to cause changes in the mitochondria. V. parahaemolyticus-initiated apoptosis is not required for bacterial cell egress Based on these studies, we made the supposition that disrupting lipids in the mitochondrial membrane causes fragmentation of this membrane and compromises the integrity of this compartment resulting in release of cytochrome C in the cytosol and the initiation of apoptosis. However, the initiation of these events would not support a mechanism for egress of V. parahaemolyticus from the host cell as apoptosis does not result in lysis or release of intracellular contents. Instead, we surmised if VPA0226 would compromise the cellular membranes by esterifying cholesterol, the integrity of all membranes would be compromised, including the plasma membrane, thereby allowing the escape of V. parahaemolyticus from host cells. To address these hypotheses, we analyzed apoptotic signaling in host cells during infection. Since mitochondria are fragmented at 2 hr PGT, we tested whether Cytochrome C, an initiator of apoptosis, is released from the mitochondria at some point after this. Consistent with this idea, we observed the release of Cytochrome C into the cytosol in CAB2 and CAB2vpa0226+WT-infected [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A,B](/articles/58057/figures#fig3s2)) by 5 hr PGT. Based on the observations that Cytochrome C is released, we expected to observe downstream indicators of apoptosis, such as fragmented DNA. Indeed, we observed positive TUNEL staining in CAB2 and CAB2vpa0226+WT infected cells but not in CAB2vpa0226 and CAB2vpa0226+S/A infected cells after 5 hr PGT ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C,D](/articles/58057/figures#fig3s2)). Interestingly, while treatment of with an inhibitor of apoptosis Z-VAD-FMK did inhibit apoptosis in staurosporine-treated cells, Z-VAD-FMK did not alter the progression of V. parahaemolyticus-mediated invasion or the survival and escape of the CAB2 strains from the host cells ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2E,F](/articles/58057/figures#fig3s2)). Based on this observation, we propose that VPA0226-mediated fragmented mitochondria lead to the initiation of apoptosis. However, death by apoptosis is not a mechanism used for cell lysis because V. parahaemolyticus escapes from the host cell 5 hr PGT whether or not apoptotic processes are active or inhibited ( [Figure VPA0226 esterifies acids To address how VPA0226-mediated fragmentation of the mitochondria was occurring, we analyzed the lipase activity of VPA0226 and its impact on host cellular lipids during the course of infection. Previously, it was shown that lipases similar to VPA0226 can esterify cholesterol by the transfer of an acyl group from an acyl-containing lipid to cholesterol thereby converting free cholesterol to a cholesteryl ester ( [Buckley, 1982](#bib10); [Nawabi et al., 2008](#bib45)). It should be noted that only the lipase activity, but not the transferase activity, has been observed previously for Vibrio lipases ( et al., 1991](#bib54); 2018](#bib64)). To confirm the lipase activity of VPA0226, we mutant a next assessed whether VPA0226 can directly modify cholesterol by incubating purified secreted wildtype or catalytically dead VPA0226- S/A with liposomes containing lipid mixtures of cardiolipin and cholesterol, followed by lipid extraction and thin layer chromatography. We observed that the wildtype but not the catalytically inactive VPA0226-S/A mutant of cholesterol ( [Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B](/articles/58057/figures#fig4s1)). We next asked whether the expression of VPA0226 would change the global profile of esterified cholesterol in cells. To test whether VPA0226 alters lipids in cells, we transfected HeLa cells vector, wildtype VPA0226 and the catalytically inactive VPA0226-H/A mutant. Our attempts to use the catalytically inactive VPA0226-S/A construct for mammalian cell expression was not successful. Therefore, we created a second construct where the catalytic histidine (residue 393) in the catalytic triad was mutated to alanine. This mutant VPA0226-H/A functions similar to the VPA0226-S/A mutant the gentamicin protection assay ( [Figure 2](/articles/58057/figures#fig4s2)). At post-transfection, we performed lipidomic analysis of cells transfected with empty vector, VPA0226 and the catalytically inactive VPA0226-H/A. Since cardiolipin is a lipid found exclusively in mitochondria and bacterial outer membranes and VPA0226, a constitutively secreted glycerophospholipid: cholesterol acyltransferase is localized to mitochondria, we speculated that VPA0226 might favor using fatty acids from cardiolipin (18:1,18:2,18:3) as a resource to esterify cholesterol. However, the levels of cholesteryl esters (CE) with cardiolipin fatty acids did not change significantly over the three samples ( [Figure 4](#fig4)). Rather, the cholesteryl esters that did dramatically the presence these fatty acids are ones implicated with innate immune signaling, with the most notable being arachidonic acid (20:4) ( [Tallima and El Ridi, 2018](#bib59)). As shown previously, depletion of cholesterol levels in cells lead to decrease in monolayer transepithelial electrical resistance and a significant increase in the Increase in esterified cholesterol compromises the integrity of the plasma membrane We speculated that the dramatic increase in esterified cholesterol that correlated with the fragmented mitochondrial membranes would compromise the integrity of all cellular membranes, including the plasma membrane. To assess whether there was a decrease in free cholesterol, we tested whether the cellular sensor for free cholesterol, SREBP, was activated in cells transfected with VPA0226 ( [Brown and Goldstein, 1997](#bib9)). HeLa cells were transfected for 14 hr (the same time point used with lipidomic assays described above) with empty vector, VPA0226 or the catalytically inactive VPA0226H/A and qPCR analysis was performed assessing genes that are targets of SREBP transcriptional activity. Using qPCR, we observed all three genes, HMGCR, HMGCS and DHCR24, were upregulated in cells expressing VPA0226, but not in cells with the empty vector or the catalytically inactive VPA0226H/A ( [Figure 5A](#fig5)). Further, the plasma membrane fractions isolated from HeLa cells expressing VPA0226 had a statistically significant reduction in free cholesterol content compared to cells expressing either empty vector or data support the proposal that free cholesterol levels are being compromised in cells expressing VPA0226. [see all](/articles/58057/figures#fig5) Next, we asked whether cells subjected to VPA0226 activity might be more fragile when subjected to mechanical stress, in this case we used osmotic stress. HeLa cells were transfected for 14 hr with empty vector, VPA0226 or the catalytically inactive VPA0226-H/A and then treated with water containing propidium iodide to assess their susceptibility to hypotonic stress. We observed that cells expressing VPA0226, but not in cells with the empty vector or the catalytically inactive VPA0226-H/A, lysed more readily as indicated by an increase in fluorescence ( [Figure 5C](#fig5)). To further assess the integrity of the plasma membrane during infection, HeLa cells were infected with CAB2 strains and tested for permeability using Sytox, a stain that is only permeable to damaged membranes. We observed that cells infected with either CAB2 or CAB2vpa0226+WT, but not with CAB2vpa0226 and CAB2vpa0226+S/A, take up the Sytox stain at 5 hr PGT, indicating that their membranes have been compromised ( [Figure 5D and E](#fig5)). Furthermore, only cells that are invaded with CAB2 take up the Sytox stain, consistent with the observation that only the invaded cells with an internal source of VPA0226 have compromised membranes ( [Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C](/articles/58057/figures#fig5s1)). Finally, to confirm VPA0226 facilitates egress of V. parahaemolyticus by changing levels of cholesterol in infected cells, we treated CAB2 and CAB2vpa0226-infected host cells with 100 \u00b5M cholesterol resulting in the addition of free cholesterol to plasma membrane ( [Chakrabarti et al., 2017](#bib12)). We discovered that CAB2 was no longer able to efficiently egress from cholesterol-treated cells at 7 hr PGT and there was no change in the inability of CAB2vpa0226 to egress from host cells ( [Figure 5F and G](#fig5)). We then infected cells with hydroxypropyl -cyclodextrin (HPCD), a compound that depletes cholesterol from membranes ( [Chakrabarti et al., 2017](#bib12)). We observed that CAB2vpa0226 could now escape from host cells at 7 hr PGT and that CAB2 followed an expected course for egress, albeit, somewhat accelerated ( [Figure 5F and H](#fig5)). These studies support our model that changes in free cholesterol are essential for egress of V. parahaemolyticus from host cells. Discussion Intracellular bacteria must find mechanisms to invade, survive, and escape the host cell. Previously, the mechanism of entry for V. parahaemolyticus was discovered to be mediated by the deamidase activity of VopC ( [Zhang et al., 2012](#bib68)). Further studies uncovered mechanisms used by V. parahaemolyticus to attenuate signaling pathways inside the infected cell, by effectors such as VopA VopL ( [De Souza Orth, 2019](#bib19); [de Souza Santos et al., 2017](#bib17)). Many other mechanisms remain to be elucidated for V. parahaemolyticus's defense against the host. Herein, we find that the escape route for V. parahaemolyticus mediated host cell invasion is dependent on the Type two secreted lipase VPA0226, which compromises the integrity of the plasma membrane by using polyunsaturated fatty acids to esterify cholesterol in the infected cell. For this pathogen, VPA0226 provides an essential activity for the virulence of the T3SS2 pathogenicity island by providing a convenient mechanism for escape. When dissecting the activity mediated by VPA0226, we were struck by its many unconventional and somewhat perplexing properties, including its secretion, enzymology and biology. VPA0226 is secreted, not by the T3SS2, but by the type two secretion system. These findings make it very clear that, although we attribute V. parahaemolyticus virulence to T3SS2 (11,43), this bacterial pathogen uses many tools outside of this pathogenicity island for a successful infection. Other tools would include external host signaling factors, such as bile salts for activation of the system and adhesion proteins used to attach to host cells ( [Li et al., 2016](#bib39); [Krachler et al., 2011](#bib35)). Another example supporting notion is the fact that the V. parahaemolyticus T3SS1 uses an effector, VPA0450, located outside its pathogenicity island to mediate an orchestrated host cell death ( [Broberg et al., 2011](#bib8); [Broberg et al., to be constitutively secreted from V. parahaemolyticus by the type two secretion system, as we saw no accumulation of VPA0226 inside V. parahaemolyticus cells, indicating that, as it is synthesized it is secreted ( [Figure 2](#fig2)). Additionally, when media is collected from log-phase V. parahaemolyticus cultures, we were able to purify VPA0226 from the culture medium. We propose that VPA0226 is constitutively secreted by intracellular bacteria during infection because we only observe changes in the mitochondria, release of cytochrome C, TUNEL-positive cells and Sytox membrane permeability in host cells that are invaded with V. parahaemolyticus expressing wild-type VPA0226. Therefore, VPA0226 targets host cell machinery from within the host cell and not from the outside. With regard to its localization, we observe transfected VPA0226 localized to the mitochondria and during invasion of V. parahaemolyticus and transfection o f VPA0226, the mitochondria are fragmented. Neighboring cells that are not invaded or transfected appear to have mitochondria with a normal phenotype. Although we have been unable to detect VPA0226 during an infection, we propose using molecular Koch's postulate that the wildtype but not the VPA0226 does not appear to encode a mitochondrial localization domain, how and why it localizes specifically to the mitochondria is unclear. Secreted phospholipases have been associated with many virulence activities, including mucus degradation, hemolysis and phagosomal escape ( [Flores-D\u00edaz et al., 2016](#bib23)). These enzymes have broad substrate specificity and can work both as lipases and acyl transferases. Homologues of VPA0226 V. harveyi, VvPlpA in V. vulnificus, and phlA in V. mimicus, are implicated in virulence but have only been shown to possess the lipase activity ( [Zhong et al., 2006](#bib70); 2002](#bib37)). Vibrio vulnificus was shown to induce NF-B-dependent mitochondrial cell death mediated by the production of lipid raft-dependent ROS ( [Lee et al., 2015](#bib38)). Another structural homologue lec/VC_A0218 in V. cholerae with lipase activity is implicated in escape from the infected amoeba ( [Van der Henst et al., 2018](#bib64)). In genetically non-homologous but functionally similar TgLCAT, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase encoded by a protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is also implicated in host cell egress ( [Pszenny et al., 2016](#bib51)). Using bioinformatics and clustering analysis, we find that VPA0226 is in a clan of enzymes containing invariant catalytic Ser, Gly, Asn and His residues which are referred to as GDSL-like together with the Salmonella phospholipase effector SseJ, are located in a mostly bacterial subfamily, closely related to plant and fungal GDSL lipases and only remotely related to animal example human Phospholipase B1 ( [Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C](/articles/58057/figures#fig4s1)). Based on this conservation, we predict that the presence of VPA0226 in the V. parahaemolyticus genome predated the acquisition T3SS2 pathogenicity island ( [Makino et al., 2003](#bib42)). From an evolutionary standpoint, it is interesting (and resourceful on the part of a bacterial pathogen) that this enzyme subsequently became an essential factor for escape of the invading V. parahaemolyticus from cells. Interestingly, the bacterial-plant-fungal GDSL lipase subfamily includes a large plant group of extracellular lipases (e.g. more than 100 different proteins in Arabidopsis), many of which are involved in regulation of defense against bacterial and fungal pathogens. Fungal members of the subfamily are found in most fungal lineages, including several pathogenic, but excluding yeast-like ones. Majority of this subfamily members are predicted to be secreted by possessing a classical signal peptide while a number of bacterial members additionally possess the autotransporter 'translocator' domains ( [Benz and Schmidt, 2011](#bib5)). This may suggest an alternative, speculative evolutionary scenario for this subfamily, involving horizontal gene transfers between pathogens and hosts. Our work confirms previous observations demonstrating that VPA0226 has lipase activity ( [Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A](/articles/58057/figures#fig4s1); [Shinoda et al., 1991](#bib54)). We went on to show both in vitro and upon ectopic expression of VPA0226 in mammalian cells VPA0226 can function as an acyl transferase. Interestingly, VPA0226 appears to act like a phospholipase A2 (PLA2) because, using lipidomics, we observe that VPA0226 specifically transfers an acyl group from position two from the glycerol backbone of a phospholipid to cholesterol ( [Haas and Stanley, 2007](#bib29)). The products from this reaction are esterified cholesterol and lysophospholipids, both of which destabilize membranes ( [Aikawa et al., 2015](#bib2)). The esterified cholesterol are quite selective including 20:3, 20:4 (arachidonic acid) and 20:5 and 22:6 (fish oil lipids). This result was quite surprising for two reasons: first, the GDSL-like lipase from bacteria have been shown to use fatty acids (such as cardiolipin) as substrates as these are associated with bacteria; second, although eukaryotes produce cardiolipin, the substrate of choice for VPA0226 was clearly to use the aforementioned PUFAs to esterify cholesterol. Interestingly, these PUFAs (arachidonic acid and fish oil lipids) are implicated with immune signaling ( [Tallima and El Ridi, 2018](#bib59); [Nicolaou et al., 2014](#bib46)). Recently, it has been reported that L. monocytogenes and Shigella flexneri, manipulate the accessible pool of cholesterol for infection and that acute mobilization of this plasma membrane cholesterol pool by oxysterols confers immunity ( [Abrams et al., 2020](#bib1)). From a biological perspective, we observe a well-timed, orchestrated escape of V. parahaemolyticus from the host cell. After V. parahaemolyticus escapes from the endosome, we postulate VPA0226 is secreted into the host cytosol, localizes to the mitochondria and esterifies cholesterol over the course of about 5-6 hr. During that time, V. parahaemolyticus reaches a density of about 300 bacteria/invaded cell and, due to mechanical stress (or possibly another unknown factor) egresses from the host cell. We observe that V. parahaemolyticus uniquely utilizes two independent secretion systems to support its intracellular lifestyle. From the perspective of virulence, V. parahaemolyticus appears to have utilized existing resources to evolve an efficient mechanism for invasion, propagation and escape. We speculate, considering the time pathogens have to evolve, that there is actually more interplay between secretion systems, providing unique, synergistic mechanisms to support a successful lifestyle of possibly pathogenicity, symbiosis and/or parasitosis. Materials and methods Bacterial strains, cell lines and culture conditions [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap58057?item=s4-1) The V. parahaemolyticus CAB2 strain was derived from POR1 (clinical isolate RIMD2210633 lacking TDH toxins), the latter being a generous gift from Drs. Tetsuya Iida and Takeshi Honda ( [Zhang et al., 2012](#bib68); [Park et al., 2004](#bib48)). The CAB2 strain was made by deleting the gene encoding the transcriptional factor ExsA, which regulates the activation of the T3SS1 [Zhang et al., 2012](#bib68); in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium, supplemented with to a final concentration of 3% (w/v), at 30\u00b0C. When necessary, the medium was supplemented with 50 g/mL spectinomycin (to select for growth of CAB2-GFP strains [ [Ritchie et al., 2012](#bib52)]) or 250 g/mL kanamycin. HeLA and Caco-2 cell lines have been obtained from ATCC, which have been authenticated and tested to confirm the absence of mycoplasma contamination. Antibodies Antibodies were purchased from following companies. Rabbit polyclonal anti LAMP-1 -Abcam, mouse polyclonal anti-EEA1 and rabbit monoclonal anti COXIV and rabbit monoclonal anti-calnexin - Cell goat polyclonal anti-E-Cadherin - R and D Systems, and mouse monoclonal anti GAPDH - Invitrogen. Secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 647/568 goat anti-mouse/rabbit were obtained from Life Technologies, and Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-mouse from Invitrogen. The antibody against VPA0226 was custom-made by Thermo Scientific. Deletion of vpa0226 and epsD from CAB2 strain [Request a detailed the nucleotide sequences 1kb upstream and downstream of the gene were cloned into pDM4, a Cmr Ori6RK suicide were then inserted between SalI and SpeI sites (upstream region) or SpeI and BglII (downstream region) sites of the plasmid multiple cloning site. For the deletion of epsD, were then inserted between SalI and SpeI sites (upstream region) or SpeI and BglII (downstream region) sites of the plasmid multiple cloning site. The resulting construct was inserted into CAB2 via conjugation by S17-1 (pir) Escherichia coli. Transconjugants were selected for on minimal marine medium (MMM) agar containing 25 g/mL chloramphenicol. Subsequent bacterial growth on MMM agar containing 15% sucrose (w/v) allowed for counter selection and curing of sacB-containing pDM4. Deletion was confirmed by PCR and sequencing CAB2vpa0226 detailed For reconstitution of CAB2vpa0226, the for pBAD/Myc-His (Invitrogen, resistance changed from ampicillin to kanamycin) between PstI and EcoRI sites. For reconstitution of CAB2epsD full length EpsD along with 1.2kb upstream and KpNI sites of pBAD/Myc-His vector. The resulting construct was inserted into CAB2vpa0226 or CAB2epsD via triparental conjugation using E. coli DH5 (pRK2073). Transconjugants on MMM agar containing kanamycin. Reconstitution was gene insertion) was introduced to CAB2 and or CAB2epsD strains for consistency in bacterial strain manipulation. Expression of vpa0226 was induced by bacterial culturing in the presence of 0.02% arabinose to activate pBAD's araC promoter and EpsD was expressed through its native promoter. For the expression of catalytically inactive VPA0226, a serine residue at position number 153 was modified to alanine through site directed mutagenesis using VPA0226pBAD/Myc-His vector as 5' and 5' GGTTGCACTCGGTGACGCCTTGTCTGATACAGGC 3'. The inserted into CAB2vpa0226 as detailed above. T3SS2 and T2SS expression and secretion assay [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap58057?item=s4-5) For the expression and secretion of T3SS2, overnight grown V. parahaemolyticus strains in MLB at 30\u00b0C were diluted to OD600 of 0.3 in LB supplemented with 0.05% bile salts and grown at 37\u00b0C for 3 hr, as previously described ( [Gotoh et al., 2010](#bib27)). For the expression fraction, bacterial cultures of OD600 of 0.5 were pelleted and resuspended in 2x Laemmli buffer. For the secretion fraction, bacterial culture supernatants were filtered with a 0.22micron filter and precipitated with deoxycholate (150 \u00b5g/ml) and trichloroacetic acid (7% v/v). Precipitated proteins were pelleted, washed twice with acetone and then resuspended in 2x Laemmli buffer. Expression and secretion levels were detected by western blot analysis. Total protein load was assessed by staining the nitrocellulose membrane with Coomassie blue. For T2SS expression and secretion, the same protocol was used except that the cultures were grown at 30\u00b0C in MLB without the plated in triplicate in a 24-well tissue culture plate at 7 \u00d7 104 cells per well and grown for 16-18 hr. Overnight grown bacterial cultures in MLB at 30\u00b0C were diluted to OD600 of 0.3 in MLB supplemented with 0.05% bile salts and grown at 37\u00b0C for 90 min to induce T3SS2. Induced V. parahaemolyticus cultures were then used to infect HeLa cells at MOI 10. Immediately after the addition of bacteria to HeLa cells, plates were centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 rpm to synchronize infection. Gentamicin was added to HeLa cells at 100 \u00b5g /ml after 2 hr of infection. Seven hours post PGT, 200 \u00b5L of media from each well was transferred to a 96-well plate and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min, then 100 \u00b5L of this supernatant was used to evaluate LDH release into the culture medium as a measure of host cells lysis using a colorimetric cytotoxicity detection kit (Takara Bio) according to manufacturer's instructions. HeLa cells treated with 1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at the end of gentamicin treatment were used as positive control and cell lysis was expressed as a % of Triton-treated cell lysis. Gentamicin protection assay [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap58057?item=s4-7) were added to triplicate wells of HeLa cell monolayers for infection as described in LDH assay. Caco2 cells were plated at 2 \u00d7 105 cells/ml in 24 wells. All infections were carried out at a MOI of 10. Gentamicin was added at 100 \u00b5g/mL to each well after 2 hr of infection to kill extracellular bacteria. At each indicated time point, monolayers of HeLa cells were washed with PBS and cells were lysed by incubation with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature with agitation. Serial dilutions of lysates were plated on MMM plates and incubated at 30\u00b0C overnight for subsequent CFU enumeration. Z-VAD-FMK (EMD Millipore) was added to HeLa cells at the beginning of infection at 50 \u00b5M where indicated. Z-VAD-FMK at this concentration prevented apoptotic cell-death induced by 1.2 M staurosporine (Abcam). When needed HeLa cells were treated with either 100 \u00b5M Cholesterol (Sigma) along with a carrier, randomly methylated -cyclodextrin (MCD) (Cyclodextrin Technologies Inc) to 1% (w/v) hydroxypropyl -cyclodextrin (HPCD) (Cyclodextrin Technologies Inc) Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap58057?item=s4-8) cells were seeded onto six-well plates containing sterile coverslips at a density of 7 \u00d7 104 cell/mL. Following infections with V. parahaemolyticus strains and indicated gentamicin treatment times, cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 3.2% (v/v) para-formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were washed in PBS and permeabilized with either 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS (EEA1) or 0.5% saponin in PBS (LAMP1) for 4 min at room temperature ( [de Souza and Orth, 2014](#bib18)). For and Cyto C, fixed cells were permeabilized with ice cold methanol for 10 min at 20\u00b0C. After washing with PBS, blocking was performed with either BSA (EEA1), ACAT1, COXIV and Cyto C) for 30 min at room temperature. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in PBS containing either 0.5% BSA and dilutions and incubated serially for 1 hr at room temperature. Between each antibody incubation, coverslips were washed three times with PBS or PBS containing 0.1% saponin (LAMP1) for 5 min each wash. Nuclei and actin cytoskeleton were stained with Hoechst (Sigma) and rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes), respectively. For Sytox orange (Thermo Fisher Scientific) staining, cells were incubated with 0.5 \u00b5M Sytox orange for 15 min following infections with V. parahaemolyticus strains and gentamicin treatment. TUNEL staining was (Promega) according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, HeLa cells following infections and gentamicin treatment were fixed with 3.2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and permeabilized using 0.2% triton x 100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with equilibration buffer for 10 min at room temperature followed by incubation with rTdT nucleotide mix at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr and nuclear staining with Hoechst. All imagings were performed on a Zeiss LSM 800 confocal microscope and images were converted using ImageJ (NIH).

Lipid spots were visualized by exposure to iodine vapor. Cholesterol, Sigma) were spotted as standards on the TLC plate. Analysis of lipids by LC-MS [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap58057?item=s4-11) All solvents were either HPLC or LC/MS grade and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). All lipid extractions were performed in 16 \u00d7 100 mm glass tubes with PTFE-lined caps (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA). Glass Pasteur pipettes and solvent-resistant plasticware pipette tips (Mettler-Toledo, Columbus, OH) were used to minimize leaching of polymers and plasticizers. Samples were transferred to glass tubes for liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) by modified Bligh/Dyer ( [Bligh and Dyer, 1959](#bib6)); 1 mL each of dichloromethane, methanol, and water were added to the glass tube containing the sample. The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged at 2671 \u00d7 g for 5 min, resulting in two distinct liquid phases. The organic phase was collected to a fresh glass tube with a Pasteur pipette and dried under N2. Samples were resuspended in were analyzed by equipped with a Shimadzu LC-30AD (Kyoto, Japan) HPLC system and a 150 mm, 5 \u00b5m Supelco Ascentis silica column (Bellefonte, PA). Samples were injected at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min at 2.5% solvent B (methyl tert-butyl ether) and 97.5% Solvent A (hexane). Solvent B was increased to 5% during 3 min and then to 60% over 6 min. Solvent B was decreased to 0% during 30 s while Solvent C (90:10 (v/v) Isopropanol-water) was set at 20% and increased to 40% during the following 11 min. Solvent C was increased to 44% during 6 min and then to 60% during 50 s. The system was held at 60% of solvent C during 1 min prior to re-equilibration at 2.5% of solvent B for 5 min at a 1.2 mL/min flow rate. Solvent D (95:5 (v/v) Acetonitrile-water with 10 mM Ammonium acetate) was infused post-column at 0.03 ml/min. Column oven temperature was set to 25\u00b0C. Data was acquired in positive and negative modes by employing polarity switching during the analysis.

Acceptance summary: This work proposes a novel mechanism for egress of Vibrio parahaemolyticus from host cells involving cholesterol esterification by type II secreted VPA0226, proposed to cause a weakening of host cell membranes, including the plasma membrane, thereby promoting Vibrio egress. This is a potentially exciting and novel mechanism for Vibrio egress, since Vibrio parahaemolyticus relies on a T3SS to invade host cells, but this T3SS does not support escape from the host cell. The pathogen would then fully benefit from the two types of secretion systems to invade and then to escape the cells. Decision letter after peer review: [Editors' note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.] Thank you for submitting your work entitled \"Vibrio deploys Type 2 secreted lipase to esterify cholesterol with host fatty acids and mediate cell egress\" for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in eLife. Reviewers all agreed that the work presented here is conceptually very interesting, particularly as it provides a potentially exciting and novel mechanism for pathogen egress, an important aspect of bacterial pathogenesis. However, consensus of all reviewers was that significant additional work (estimated to take many months) is required to strengthen the proposed overall conclusion of this study. Therefore, we decided to reject the manuscript for now. For guidance, the reviewers' comments are available below. We hope that you find them constructive and that they help you amend the work. Reviewer #1: This work proposes a novel mechanism for egress of Vibrio parahaemolyticus from host cells involving cholesterol esterification by type II secreted VPA0226. This is proposed to cause a weakening of host cell membranes, including of the plasma membrane, thereby promoting Vibrio egress. This is a potentially exciting and novel mechanism for pathogen egress, a mostly underexplored aspect of bacterial pathogenesis. However, the proposed model is essentially based in experiments performed in mammalian cells ectopically expressing VPA0226 or in biochemical experiments with purified VPA0226. The evidence to establish that the proposed egress mechanism occurs in infected cells must be strengthened. Essential revisions: 1) It is essential to show that free cholesterol levels are indeed decreased in infected cells by biochemical analysis of host lipids and/or (at the very least) by using analysis of the expression of HMGCR, HMGCS and DHCR24 as readout. 2) Another aspect that should be better addressed is the subcellular localization of VPA0226 during host cell infection, which could aid at a better understanding of its biological role. For example, it is unclear how the localization of ectopically expressed VPA0226 at the mitochondria relates to its proposed activity and function. With the available anti-VPA0226 antibody, or by using V. parahaemolyticus transformed with epitope tagged VPA0226, it should be possible to monitor the presence and/or localization of the protein within infected cells by controlled protein fractionation and/or by immunofluorescence microscopy. Reviewer #2: Summary: This manuscript by de Souza Santos et al. describes the characterization of VPA0226, a Vibrio protein required for egress of intracellular bacteria. The authors provide experiments in support of a model in which VPA0226 is secreted by the type 2 secretion system and is required for esterification of cholesterol, weakening the plasma membrane and allowing for bacterial egress. Although the absence of VPA0226 clearly leads to accumulation of bacteria inside cells at the time of observation, the presented experiments are not sufficient to unambiguously support the model proposed by the authors. Essential revisions: 1) The exact role of the T2SS The notion that VPA0226 is a T2SS substrate relies on Western blot experiment in which the authors analyze the presence of VPA0226 in the bacterial pellet (expression) and in the supernatant (secretion). In agreement with the notion that VPA0226 is a T2SS substrate, it is not present in the supernatant of the T2SS mutant. However, it is not present in the pellet either. It seems cautious to conclude that VPA0226 is not expressed at all in the T2SS mutant. How could the authors then conclude that VPA0226 is a T2SS substrate? Finally, if VPA0226 requires the T2SS for function, then one would expect the T2SS mutant to display an egress defect. Is it the case? 2) Cholesterol esterification and weakening of the plasma membrane Although the authors show modification of total cholesterol, they do not demonstrate that the modified version is in the plasma membrane, as implied by their model. Also, the papers cited in reference of cholesterol esterification leading to weakening of the plasma membrane are misused. In these studies, it was not esterification but depletion of total cholesterol that was tested, and the treatment did not lead to membrane weakening, but remodeling of tight junctions. As a consequence, there is no evidence that cholesterol esterification weakens the plasma membrane and the authors need to demonstrate what remains an assumption. 3) The exact role of VPA0266 in the observed egress defect It is suggested that VPA02266-mediated cholesterol esterification leads to plasma membrane leakiness, thus facilitating egress. If this is true, then increasing cholesterol esterification (by an independent method, using manipulation of cholesterol metabolism for instance) should rescue the bacterial egress defect of the VPA0266 mutant. 4) Biological significance of the observed defects The authors should consider studying the role of VPA0266 in egress using various epithelial cell types. Importantly, using Caco-2 cells instead of HeLa cells would address the potential role of cell polarity in VPA0226 function (and Vibrio infection). Perhaps more importantly, the authors should demonstrate the role of VPA0266 in existing models of Vibrio pathogenesis. Reviewer #3: The manuscript by de Souza Santos et al., describes the characterization of the secreted lipase VPA0226 and its requirement for cellular egress by Vibrio parahaemolyticus. The major findings include: - the enzymatic activity of VPA0226 is required for bacterial escape from host cells; - the somewhat surprising discovery that the lipase is not secreted by the type 3 secretion system 2. Instead, it enters the extracellular space through the type 2 secretion system; - VPA0226 associates with mitochondria and causes mitochondrial fragmentation; - while apoptosis is induced, it is not required for cell egress by V. para; - VPA0226 esterifies cholesterol The results are intriguing, the cell biology is convincing and the study represents a significant advance to the field, although the mechanism by which VPA0226 induces cell egress is not fully established. While the plasma membrane is destabilized as measured by Sytox permeability and sensitivity to osmotic stress following infection by V. para expressing active lipase and transfection of active lipase, respectively, it is not clear if this is due to esterification of cholesterol in the plasma membrane. Are we to assume that the effect is on plasma membrane cholesterol since the majority of cellular cholesterol is found in the plasma membrane? Why then is there such a dramatic effect on mitochondria that only contains a fraction of cellular cholesterol? The authors could isolate plasma membrane before performing lipidomic analysis rather than analyzing total cellular lipids to verify that plasma membrane cholesterol is modified. A strain of V. para that is deleted for hemolysins and the T3SS1 was used in this study. What is the role of VPA0226 in wild type V. para? Is it required for cellular escape or is this phenotype masked in the presence of other virulence factors? VPA0226 is capable of esterifying cholesterol using cardiolipin in vitro; however, another lipid source (s) of fatty acids is used in the host cell. Please address this difference. This lipase seems to have broad specificity. Regarding the results in Figure 3A: \"a clear difference\" was not observed \"in the migration pattern of total lipids from VPA0226 WT transfected compared to those transfected inactive VPA0226 modify text. The inactive VPA0226 that the catalytic residue serine-153 substituted with alanine (VPA0226 S/A) was used in the infection experiments, while the transfection experiments used VPA0226 with a His393Ala substitution (VPA0226 H/A). S/A was activity; however, that VPA0226 H/A is inactive was not verified. The activity of this variant should be determined. That VPA0226 S/A could not be expressed in the mammalian cells and an alternative mutant VPA0226 was made for the transfection experiments should be mentioned in the Results section. The statistically significant reduction in entry into HeLa cells by V. para lacking VPA0226 was not addressed (Figure 1A). Is this restored with complementation? Does VPA0226 affect the plasma membrane from the outside? [Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.] Thank you for submitting your article \"Vibrio deploys Type 2 secreted lipase to esterify cholesterol with host fatty acids and mediate cell egress\" for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another extensively and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. The editors have judged that your manuscript is of significant interest, but as described below additional experiments are required before it is published. Because many researchers have temporarily lost access to their labs given the COVID19-pandemic, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is \"in revision at eLife\". Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.) This work proposes a novel mechanism for egress of Vibrio parahaemolyticus from host cells involving cholesterol esterification by type II secreted VPA0226, proposed to cause a weakening of host cell membranes, including the plasma membrane, thereby promoting Vibrio egress. This is a potentially exciting and novel mechanism for Vibrio egress, since Vibrio parahaemolyticus relies on a T3SS to invade host cells, but this T3SS does not support escape from the host cell. The pathogen would then fully benefit from the two types of secretion systems to invade and then to escape the cells. The reviewers have all reviewed a previous version of this article, and all agreed that the work had been significantly improved. There remains a contentious point however about the fact that VPA0226 is a T2SS substrate and reviewers propose a list of experiments to unambiguously demonstrate the claim: 1) Because the VPA0226 protein cannot be detected in the pellet of the T2SS mutant, it is hard to definitely conclude that the T2SS is required for secretion, as opposed to any indirect effect including expression or protein stability. It is quite possible that there is a global effect on gene expression in the T2SS mutant since this mutant is unable to invade host cells. Please test by qPCR if the loss of intracellular VPA0226 detection is due to loss of expression. Then please express VPA0226 from a plasmid in the WT and T2SS mutant that allows for inducible expression and try to detect periplasmic accumulation of VPA0226. In the end, pulse-chase experiments to determine whether VPA0226 gets degraded in the periplasm of the T2SS mutant may be necessary. 2) Please address the question of timing of egress that you commented on were halted in the mutant as opposed to delayed with the bacteria ultimately dying in intact cells. To ensure that bacterial death is not due to gentamicin in the medium ultimately reaching intracellular bacteria, please repeat the experiment, killing the extracellular bacteria with gentamicin for an hour after invasion then replacing with fresh medium and very low levels of gentamicin. It would add to the paper if cytosolic bacteria could egress in the end, through host cell exhaustion, but Vibrio has evolved a very specific way of doing it.

What follows is the authors' response to the first round of review.] Reviewer #1: [...] Essential revisions: 1) It is essential to show that free cholesterol levels are indeed decreased in infected cells by biochemical analysis of host lipids and/or (at the very least) by using analysis of the expression of HMGCR, HMGCS and DHCR24 as readout. We agree that infected cells should be tested for changes in levels of free cholesterol. To test for VPA0226-mediated changes in levels of cholesterol in infected cells, we treated CAB2 infected host cells with 100\u00b5M cholesterol resulting in the addition of free cholesterol to plasma membrane and discovered that CAB2 was no longer able to efficiently egress from cholesterol treated cells. Similarly, we treated CAB2vpa0226 infected cells with hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin (HPCD), a compound that depletes cholesterol from membranes, and observed that CAB2vpa0226 could now escape from host cells. These studies support our model that changes in free cholesterol are important for egress of V. para from host cells. 2) Another aspect that should be better addressed is the subcellular localization of VPA0226 during host cell infection, which could aid at a better understanding of its biological role. For example, it is unclear how the localization of ectopically expressed VPA0226 at the mitochondria relates to its proposed activity and function.

We tried to visualize VPA0226 in infected cells both with the antibody for VPA0226 and a VPA0226-3XFLAG tagged protein, but were unable to visualize VPA0226 by immunostaining. Reviewer #2: [...] Essential revisions: 1) The exact role of the T2SS The notion that VPA0226 is a T2SS substrate relies on Western blot experiment in which the authors analyze the presence of VPA0226 in the bacterial pellet (expression) and in the supernatant (secretion).

Finally, if VPA0226 requires the T2SS for function, then one would expect the T2SS mutant to display an egress defect. Is it the case? The westerns for these experiments have been repeated with proper controls. The absence of a secreted protein in the pellet fraction may indicate that the enzyme may be toxic to the bacteria. In support of this hypothesis, we tried to express VPA0226 without its secretion signal and observed no protein in the bacterial pellet or the supernatant. V. para containing a T2SS mutant is unable to invade host cells, which could be explained by the lack of other unexplored T2SS factors that may be involved in the holistic process of invasion into a host cell (data not shown). 2) Cholesterol esterification and weakening of the plasma membrane Although the authors show modification of total cholesterol, they do not demonstrate that the modified version is in the plasma membrane, as implied by their model. Also, the papers cited in reference of cholesterol esterification leading to weakening of the plasma membrane are misused. In these studies, it was not esterification but depletion of total cholesterol that was tested, and the treatment did not lead to membrane weakening, but remodeling of tight junctions. As a consequence, there is no evidence that cholesterol esterification weakens the plasma membrane and the authors need to demonstrate what remains an assumption. We agree that infected cells should be tested for changes in levels of free cholesterol on the plasma membrane. To test for VPA0226-mediated changes in levels of cholesterol in infected cells, we treated CAB2 infected host cells with 100\u00b5M cholesterol resulting in the addition of free cholesterol to plasma membrane and discovered that CAB2 was no longer able to efficiently egress from Cholesterol treated cells. Similarly, we treated CAB2vpa0226 infected cells with hydroxypropyl -cyclodextrin (HPCD), a compound that depletes cholesterol from membranes, and observed that CAB2vpa0226 could now escape from host cells. These studies support our model that changes in free cholesterol are important for egress of V. para from host cells. We have also added new data wherein we have isolated plasma membrane fractions from HeLa cells transfected with VPA0226 or catalytically inactive VPA0226 H/A and observed that there was reduced free cholesterol content in cells expressing wild-type VPA0226 compared to those of the cells expressing either empty vector or catalytically inactive VPA0226 (Figure 5B). We have modified text to reflect the references cited. 3) The exact role of VPA0266 in the observed egress defect It is suggested that VPA02266-mediated cholesterol esterification leads to plasma membrane leakiness, thus facilitating egress. If this is true, then increasing cholesterol esterification (by an independent method, using manipulation of cholesterol metabolism for instance) should rescue the bacterial egress defect of the VPA0266 mutant. As suggested and described above, we treated CAB2vpa02226 infected cells with hydroxypropyl -cyclodextrin (HPCD), a compound that depletes cholesterol, and observed that CAB2vpa0226 could now escape from host cells. 4) Biological significance of the observed defects The authors should consider studying the role of VPA0266 in egress using various epithelial cell types. Importantly, using Caco-2 cells instead of HeLa cells would address the potential role of cell polarity in VPA0226 function (and Vibrio infection). Perhaps more importantly, the authors should demonstrate the role of VPA0266 in existing models of Vibrio pathogenesis. As suggested by this reviewer, we infected Caco-2 cells, and observed egress of CAB2 but not CAB2vpa0226 at 7 hours post gentamicin treatment (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E). Reviewer #3: The manuscript by de Souza Santos et al., describes the characterization of the secreted lipase VPA0226 and its requirement for cellular egress by Vibrio parahaemolyticus. The major findings include: the enzymatic activity of VPA0226 is required for bacterial escape from host cells; the somewhat surprising discovery that the lipase is not secreted by the type 3 secretion system 2. Instead, it enters the extracellular space through the type 2 secretion system; VPA0226 associates with mitochondria and causes mitochondrial fragmentation; while apoptosis is induced, it is not required for cell egress by V. para; VPA0226 esterifies cholesterol The results are intriguing, the cell biology is convincing and the study represents a significant advance to the field, although the mechanism by which VPA0226 induces cell egress is not fully established. While the plasma membrane is destabilized as measured by Sytox permeability and sensitivity to osmotic stress following infection by V. para expressing active lipase and transfection of active lipase, respectively, it is not clear if this is due to esterification of cholesterol in the plasma membrane. Are we to assume that the effect is on plasma membrane cholesterol since the majority of cellular cholesterol is found in the plasma membrane? Why then is there such a dramatic effect on mitochondria that only contains a fraction of cellular cholesterol? The authors could isolate plasma membrane before performing lipidomic analysis rather than analyzing total cellular lipids to verify that plasma membrane cholesterol is modified. We observe fragmentation of the mitochondria that is consistent with esterification of cholesterol and the activation of SREBP signaling, indicative of decreased cholesterol in the cell. We have isolated plasma membrane fractions from HeLa cells transfected with VPA0226 or catalytically inactive VPA0226 H/A and observed that there was reduced free cholesterol content in cells expressing wild-type VPA0226 compared to those of the cells expressing either empty vector or catalytically inactive VPA0226 (Figure 5B). A strain of V. para that is deleted for hemolysins and the T3SS1 was used in this study. What is the role of VPA0226 in wild type V. para? Is it required for cellular escape or is this phenotype masked in the presence of other virulence factors? The invasion phenotype in tissue culture cells is masked by the T3SS1 and the hemolysins. Trying to visualize this phenotype in animals is out of the scope of this study. VPA0226 is capable of esterifying cholesterol using cardiolipin in vitro; however, another lipid source(s) of fatty acids is used in the host cell. Please address this difference. This lipase seems to have broad specificity. This lipase does have broad specificity. In vitro, as this is a bacterial lipase, cardiolipin was the logical substrate to use for transferase experiments. However, we observe that when given a choice of all phospholipids in a host cell, the lipids transferred were 20:3, 20:4, 20:5 and 22:6 production of CE(20:3), CE(20:4), CE(20:5) and CE(22:6). Regarding the results in Figure 3A: \"a clear difference\" was not observed \"in the migration pattern of total lipids from VPA0226 WT transfected compared to those transfected inactive VPA0226 fatty acids\"). Please modify text. The text has been modified and we do observe esterified cholesterol based on our lipidomic experiments (Figure 3A). As the TLC lipidomic analysis is not quantitative and we cannot identify the particular cellular lipid used in the by VPA0226 and, as suggested by other reviewers, we have decided to delete the cellular TLC experiments previously shown in Figure 3A and Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C. The inactive VPA0226 that has the catalytic residue serine-153 substituted with alanine (VPA0226 S/A) was used in the infection experiments, while the transfection experiments used VPA0226 with a His393Ala substitution (VPA0226 H/A). S/A was activity; however, that VPA0226 H/A is inactive was not verified. The activity of this variant should be determined. That VPA0226 S/A could not be expressed in the mammalian cells and an alternative mutant VPA0226 was made for the transfection experiments should be mentioned in the Results section. We have mentioned that we used two different mutants and why in the Results section. Since our S153A mutant was unable to be stably express in mammalian cells we have used a Histine 393 Alanine mutant that mutates another residue in the conserved catalytic triad that previously was documented (Akoh and Shaw et al., 2004). The H393A mutant when tested in gentamicin protection assay behaved similar to the S153A mutant. (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2). The statistically significant reduction in entry into HeLa cells by V. para lacking VPA0226 was not addressed (Figure 1A). Is this restored with complementation? We have since repeated these assays and found that the entry of the V. para lacking VPA0226 was not reduced in a statically significant way. We apologize for this mis-judgment and have updated the figure to reflect this point. Does VPA0226 affect the plasma membrane from the outside? VPA0226 seems to affect only invaded cells, as we observe mitochondrial fragmentation only in invaded cells. Data for this observation was added. [Editors' note: what follows is the authors' response to the second round of review.] [...] There remains a contentious point however about the fact that VPA0226 is a T2SS substrate and reviewers propose a list of experiments to unambiguously demonstrate the claim: 1) Because the VPA0226 protein cannot be detected in the pellet of the T2SS mutant, it is hard to definitely conclude that the T2SS is required for secretion, as opposed to any indirect effect including expression or protein stability. It is quite possible that there is a global effect on gene expression in the T2SS mutant since this mutant is unable to invade host cells. Please test by qPCR if the loss of intracellular VPA0226 detection is due to loss of expression. Then please express VPA0226 from a plasmid in the WT and T2SS mutant that allows for inducible expression and try to detect periplasmic accumulation of VPA0226. In the end, pulse-chase experiments to determine whether VPA0226 gets degraded in the periplasm of the T2SS mutant may be necessary. As suggested by the reviewer, we performed the following experiments (subsection \"VPA0226 is secreted by the type 2 secretion system\"): \"As we did not observe VPA0226 in the pellet fraction of CAB2epsD, we performed qPCR analysis to confirm the expression of VPA0226 in CAB2epsD strain and observed a significant reduction in the expression level of VPA0226 in CAB2epsD compared to CAB2 (Figure 2C). However, when we overexpressed VPA0226 through a plasmid in CAB2epsD, we observed a slightly higher migrating band corresponding to the uncleaved version of VPA0226 in the pellet fraction along with a few other lower migrating bands indicating a possible degradation of VPA0226(Figure 2D). Taken together, these results demonstrate that VPA0226 is secreted by the type 2 secretion system (Figure 2E).\" 2) Please address the question of timing of egress that you commented on were halted in the mutant as opposed to delayed with the bacteria ultimately dying in intact cells. To ensure that bacterial death is not due to gentamicin in the medium ultimately reaching intracellular bacteria, please repeat the experiment, killing the extracellular bacteria with gentamicin for an hour after invasion then replacing with fresh medium and very low levels of gentamicin. It would add to the paper if cytosolic bacteria could egress in the end, through host cell exhaustion, but Vibrio has evolved a very specific way of doing it. As suggested, we performed a gentamycin protection assay with lower levels of gentamycin and confirmed that bacterial death is not due to experimental design. Subsection \"The catalytic activity of VPA0226 is required for V. parahaemolyticus egress from host cell\": \"...we performed an extended time course gentamicin protection assay in which Hela cells were infected with V. parahaemolyticus strains for 2 hours, treated with gentamicin at 100\u00b5g/ml for 1 hour and then changed to 10\u00b5g/ml for the remainder of the assay (3, 6, 8,12 and 24 hours). As observed previously, Hela cells invaded with CAB2vpa0226 or CAB2vpa0226+S/A strains still contained viable bacteria even at 12h PGT in contrast to CAB2 or CAB2vpa0226+WT invaded Hela cells that had no viable bacteria from 8h PGT onwards (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A and B). However, at 24 hours PGT, no viable bacteria were present in HeLA cells under any conditions and majority of the Hela cells appeared rounded possibly due to exhaustion (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B).\" [https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.58057.sa2](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.58057.sa2) Article and author information Author details Funding National Institutes of Health (R01 GM115188) - Kim Orth National Institutes of Health (RO1 GM113079) - Jen Liou Once Upon A Time Foundation - Kim Orth Welch Foundation (I-1561) - Kim Orth National Institutes of Health (PO1 HL20948) - Jeffrey G McDonald The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

The model BMC is the carboxysome that encapsulates enzymes for CO2 fixation to increase efficiency and is found in many autotrophic bacteria, such as cyanobacteria. Despite their importance in the global carbon cycle, little is known about how carboxysomes are spatially regulated. We recently identified the two-factor system required for the maintenance of carboxysome distribution (McdAB). McdA drives the equal spacing of carboxysomes via interactions with McdB, which associates with carboxysomes. McdA is a ParA/MinD ATPase, a protein family well-studied in positioning diverse cellular structures in bacteria. However, the adaptor proteins like McdB that connect these ATPases to their cargos are extremely diverse. In fact, McdB represents a completely unstudied class of proteins. Despite the diversity, many adaptor proteins undergo phase separation, but functional roles remain unclear. Here, we define the domain architecture of McdB from the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, and dissect its mode formation. We domain and a C-terminal domain that trimerizes McdB dimers and provides increased valency for condensate formation. We then identify critical basic residues in the IDR, which we mutate to glutamines to solubilize condensates. Finally, we find that a condensate-defective mutant of McdB has altered association with carboxysomes and influences carboxysome enzyme content. The results have broad implications for understanding spatial organization of BMCs and the molecular grammar "}
