Amanda has been in conscious contact with the energy realm since she was a little girl. Today, she serves as a conduit for pure Source Energy, which allows her to support you in releasing blockages and disharmony of all kinds (spiritual, emotional, and physical) through her unique style of Remote Energy Healing. If you like Reiki, you'll likely love Amanda's sessions, which are quick, gentle-yet-powerful bursts of healing and spiritual activation. Each session lasts approximately 20 minutes, and you'll receive 48 hours of followup support/intuitive coaching over email as part of your Energy Healing experience. What to expect When you book your session, you will fill in an intake form that will allow me to get a sense of what you would like to release, heal, or get clarity on as a result of your Energy Healing. The information that you provide will also help serve as the intention for your session. If you would like to listen to music during the session, you may either listen to music of your choosing, or follow the links to specific songs that I recommend for you in the intake form. If you are unable to access this link, please let us know and we will send it manually. The first part of your session will be video chat, then we will close the chat and your [distance healing](https://www.myinfinitychiro.com/post/distance-reiki-healing) session will begin. When choosing a date and time for your session, be sure to allow for at least an hour of integration time after we complete the energy work before returning to your usual activities. You may also want to journal about your experience, so I recommend having a notebook handy. Note, Energy Healing practitioners do not diagnose or cure medical conditions. The purpose of this page is to provide some general knowledge about Angelic Energy Healing. * All sessions are tailored to the client's needs, where your Practitioner may incorporate a number of techniques and/or styles * Sessions * Each session is approximately 20-30 minutes in duration * Receipts are issued at the completion of your session * This is your time to relax and escape - please turn off your cell phone to prevent disturbances or to airplane mode if you are listening to music * Sessions begin promptly so please be ready to receive * As a courtesy to your practitioner and others wishing to book appointments, we ask 24 hours notice for cancellation of booked appointments Please complete your intake form prior to connecting via video for your initial visit. A secure link is sent to your email with your appointment confirmation email. Some questions that will be asked include: * Reason for the visit * History/experience with energy healing Preparing for your session We will initially connect by video chat at the time of your session. We will have a moment to discuss your intentions for your session, then I will ask you to turn off the video chat, lie down on your back in a comfortable location such as a bed or couch and press play on the song you have chosen to listen to (if you decide you want to listen to music). I will [connect with your energy remotely](https://www.myinfinitychiro.com/post/distance-reiki-healing), and the healing session will begin. The session itself will last approximately 20 minutes, depending on how long I am guided to work with you. You can set a timer on your phone for 20 minutes if you would prefer to know when the session is over, or you can simply allow yourself to lie there for as long as you need (and are able too). During your session You'll close your eyes, and keep them closed for the duration of the session. All you have to do is be open to receive, and notice what happens. You may feel a mixture of physical sensations and more mental/emotional impressions. Clients describe the experience as being magical, blissful, and deeply healing. Your comfort during the treatment session is important, and for that reason, you may wear what you feel comfortable in. After your session When the session is over, I will send you an email sharing anything that came through for me when I was working on you. I sometimes receive messages and/or images that I am instructed to share with you, although I can't guarantee that this will always be the case. Self-care recommendations may be provided and can range from relaxation techniques to lifestyle changes. ** Please keep in mind self-care is very important in facilitating your health goals Payment, receipts and re-booking Your practitioner will provide you with a receipt for your visit at the end of your appointment.
