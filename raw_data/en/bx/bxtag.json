Subclause (I) shall not apply in a year where the adjustment to the fee schedules determined under clause (i) is 0.0 or a percentage decrease for a year. The application of the productivity adjustment under subclause (I) shall not result in an adjustment to the fee schedules under clause (i) being less than 0.0 for a year. The application of subclause (II) may result in an adjustment to the fee schedules under clause (i) being less than 0.0 for a year, and may result in payment rates for a year being less than such payment rates for the preceding year. (v) The Secretary shall reduce by 2 percent the fee schedules otherwise determined under clause (i) for 2013, and such reduced fee schedules shall serve as the base for 2014 and subsequent years. (B) The Secretary may make further adjustments or exceptions to the fee schedules to assure adequate reimbursement of (i) emergency laboratory tests needed for the provision of bona fide emergency services, and (ii) certain low volume high-cost tests where highly sophisticated equipment or extremely skilled personnel are necessary to assure quality.

If a person knowingly and willfully and on a repeated basis bills for a clinical diagnostic laboratory test in violation of the previous sentence, the Secretary may apply sanctions against the person in the same manner as the Secretary may apply sanctions against a physician in accordance with paragraph (2) of [9](#1395l_9_target) with respect to a physician. Paragraph (4) of such section shall apply in this subparagraph in the same manner as such paragraph applies to such section. (6) For tests furnished before January 1, 2017, in the case of any diagnostic laboratory test payment for which is not made on the basis of a fee schedule under paragraph (1), the Secretary may establish a payment rate which is acceptable to the person or entity performing the test and which would be considered the full charge for such tests. Such negotiated rate shall be limited to an amount not in excess of the total payment that would have been made for the services in the absence of such rate. (7) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (4) and (8)(A) The Secretary shall establish by regulation procedures for determining the basis for, and amount of, payment under this subsection for any clinical diagnostic laboratory test with respect to which a new or substantially revised HCPCS code is assigned on or after January 1, 2005 (in this paragraph referred to as \"new tests\").

(C) Under the procedures established pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall\u2014 (i) set forth the criteria for making determinations under subparagraph (A); and (ii) make available to the public the data (other than proprietary data) considered in making such determinations. (D) The Secretary may convene such further public meetings to receive public comments on payment amounts for new tests under this subsection as the Secretary deems appropriate. (E) For purposes of this paragraph: (i) The term \"HCPCS\" refers to the Health Care Procedure Coding System. (ii) A code shall be considered to be \"substantially revised\" if there is a substantive change to the definition of the test or procedure to which the code applies (such as a new analyte or a new methodology for measuring an existing analyte-specific test). (9) Notwithstanding any other provision in this part, in the case of any diagnostic laboratory test for HbA1c that is labeled by the Food and Drug Administration for home use and is furnished on or after April 1, 2008, the payment rate for such test shall be the payment rate established under this part for a glycated hemoglobin test (identified as of October 1, 2007, by HCPCS code 83036 (and any succeeding codes)). (i) Outpatient surgery (1) The Secretary shall, in consultation with appropriate medical organizations\u2014 (A) specify those surgical procedures which are appropriately (when considered in terms of the proper utilization of hospital inpatient facilities) performed on an inpatient basis in a hospital but which also can be performed safely on an ambulatory basis in an ambulatory surgical center (meeting the standards specified under (B) specify those surgical procedures which are appropriately (when considered in terms of the proper utilization of hospital inpatient facilities) performed on an inpatient basis in a hospital but which also can be performed safely on an ambulatory basis in a physician's office.

Each amount so established shall be reviewed and updated not later than July 1, 1987, and annually thereafter to take account of varying conditions in different areas. (B) The amount of payment to be made under this part for facility services furnished, in connection with a surgical procedure specified pursuant to paragraph (1)(B), in a physician's office shall be equal to 80 percent of a standard overhead amount established by the Secretary (with respect to each such procedure) on the basis of the Secretary's estimate of a fair fee which\u2014 (i) takes into account additional costs, not usually included in the professional fee, incurred by physicians in securing, maintaining, and staffing the facilities and ancillary services appropriate for the performance of such procedure in the physician's office, and (ii) takes such items into account in such a manner which will assure that the performance of such procedure in the physician's office will result in substantially less amounts paid under this subchapter than would have been paid if the services had been furnished on an inpatient basis in a hospital. Each amount so established shall be reviewed and updated not later than July 1, 1987, and annually thereafter to take account of varying conditions in different areas. (C)(i) Notwithstanding the second sentence of each of subparagraphs (A) and (B), except as otherwise specified in clauses (ii), (iii), and (iv), if the Secretary has not updated amounts established under such subparagraphs or under subparagraph (D), with respect to facility services furnished during a fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1986 or a calendar year (beginning with 2006)), such amounts shall be increased by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (U.S. city average) as estimated by the Secretary for the 12-month period ending with the midpoint of the year involved. (ii) In each of the fiscal years 1998 through 2002, the increase under this subparagraph shall be reduced (but not below zero) by 2.0 percentage points.

(iv) In fiscal year 2005, the last quarter of calendar year 2005, and each of calendar years 2006 through 2009, the increase under this subparagraph shall be 0 percent. (D)(i) Taking into account the recommendations in the report under section 626(d) of Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, the Secretary shall implement a revised payment system for payment of surgical services furnished in ambulatory surgical centers. (ii) In the year the system described in clause (i) is implemented, such system shall be designed to result in the same aggregate amount of expenditures for such services as would be made if this subparagraph did not apply, as estimated by the Secretary and taking into account reduced expenditures that would apply if subparagraph (E) were to continue to apply, as estimated by the Secretary. (iii) The Secretary shall implement the system described in clause (i) for periods in a manner so that it is first effective beginning on or after January 1, 2006, and not later than January 1, 2008. (iv) The Secretary may implement such system in a manner so as to provide for a reduction in any annual update for failure to report on quality measures in accordance with paragraph (7).

(B) Unadjusted copayment amount (i) In general For purposes of this subsection, subject to clause (ii), the \"unadjusted copayment amount\" applicable to a covered OPD service (or group of such services) is 20 percent of the national median of the charges for the service (or services within the group) furnished during 1996, updated to 1999 using the Secretary's estimate of charge growth during the period. (ii) Adjusted to be 20 percent when fully phased in If the pre-deductible payment percentage for a covered OPD service (or group of such services) furnished in a year would be equal to or exceed 80 percent, then the unadjusted copayment amount shall be 20 percent of amount determined under subparagraph (D). (iii) Rules for new services The Secretary shall establish rules for establishment of an unadjusted copayment amount for a covered OPD service not furnished during 1996, based upon its classification within a group of such services. (C) Calculation of conversion factors (i) For 1999 (I) In general The Secretary shall establish a 1999 conversion factor for determining the medicare OPD fee schedule amounts for each covered OPD service (or group of such services) furnished in 1999. Such conversion factor shall be established on the basis of the weights and frequencies described in paragraph (2)(C) and in such a manner that the sum for all services and groups of the products (described in subclause (II) for each such service or group) equals the total projected amount described in subparagraph (A). (II) Product described The Secretary shall determine for each service or group the product of the medicare OPD fee schedule amounts (taking into account appropriate adjustments described in paragraphs (2)(D) and (2)(E)) and the estimated frequencies for such service or group. (ii) Subsequent years Subject to paragraph (8)(B), the Secretary shall establish a conversion factor for covered OPD services furnished in subsequent years in an amount equal to the conversion factor established under this subparagraph and applicable to such services furnished in the previous year increased by the OPD fee schedule increase factor specified under clause (iv) for the year involved. (iii) Adjustment for service mix changes Insofar as the Secretary determines that the adjustments for service mix under paragraph (2) for a previous year (or estimates that such adjustments for a future year) did (or are likely to) result in a change in aggregate payments under this subsection during the year that are a result of changes in the coding or classification of covered OPD services that do not reflect real changes in service mix, the Secretary may adjust the conversion factor computed under this subparagraph for subsequent years so as to eliminate the effect of such coding or classification changes. (iv) OPD fee schedule increase factor For purposes of this subparagraph, subject to paragraph (17) and subparagraph (F) of this paragraph, the \"OPD fee schedule increase factor\" for services furnished in a year is equal to the market basket percentage increase applicable under (D) Calculation of medicare OPD fee schedule amounts The Secretary shall compute a medicare OPD fee schedule amount for each covered OPD service (or group of such services) furnished in a year, in an amount equal to the product of\u2014 (i) the conversion factor computed under subparagraph (C) for the year, and (ii) the relative payment weight (determined under paragraph (2)(C)) for the service or group. (E) Pre-deductible payment percentage The pre-deductible payment percentage for a covered OPD service (or group of such services) furnished in a year is equal to the ratio of\u2014 (i) the medicare OPD fee schedule amount established under subparagraph (D) for the year, minus the unadjusted copayment amount determined under subparagraph (B) for the service or group, to (ii) the medicare OPD fee schedule amount determined under subparagraph (D) for the year for such service or group. (F) Productivity and other adjustment After determining the OPD fee schedule increase factor under subparagraph (C)(iv), the Secretary shall reduce such increase factor\u2014 (i) for 2012 and subsequent years, by the productivity adjustment described in (ii) for each of 2010 through 2019, by the adjustment described in subparagraph (G). The application of this subparagraph may result in the increase factor under subparagraph (C)(iv) being less than 0.0 for a year, and may result in payment rates under the payment system under this subsection for a year being less than such payment rates for the preceding year. (G) Other adjustment For purposes of subparagraph (F)(ii), the adjustment described in this subparagraph is\u2014 (i) for each of 2010 and 2011, 0.25 percentage point; (ii) for each of 2012 and 2013, 0.1 percentage point; (iii) for 2014, 0.3 percentage point; (iv) for each of 2015 and 2016, 0.2 percentage point; and (v) for each of 2017, 2018, and 2019, 0.75 percentage point. (4) Medicare payment amount The amount of payment made from the Trust Fund under this part for a covered OPD service (and such services classified within a group) furnished in a year is determined, subject to paragraph (7), as follows: (A) Fee schedule adjustments The medicare OPD fee schedule amount (computed under paragraph (3)(D)) for the service or group and year is adjusted for relative differences in the cost of labor and other factors determined by the Secretary, as computed under paragraphs (2)(D) and (2)(E). (B) Subtract applicable deductible Reduce the adjusted amount determined under subparagraph (A) by the amount of the deductible under subsection (b), to the extent applicable. (C) Apply payment proportion to remainder The amount of payment is the amount so determined under subparagraph (B) multiplied by the pre-deductible payment percentage (as determined under paragraph (3)(E)) for the service or group and year involved, plus the amount of any reduction in the copayment amount attributable to paragraph (8)(C). (5) Outlier adjustment (A) In general Subject to subparagraph (D), the Secretary shall provide for an additional payment for each covered OPD service (or group of services) for which a hospital's charges, adjusted to cost, exceed\u2014 (i) a fixed multiple of the sum of\u2014 (I) the applicable medicare OPD fee schedule amount determined under paragraph (3)(D), as adjusted under paragraph (4)(A) (other than for adjustments under this paragraph or paragraph (6)); and (II) any transitional pass-through payment under paragraph (6); and (ii) at the option of the Secretary, such fixed dollar amount as the Secretary may establish. (B) Amount of adjustment The amount of the additional payment under subparagraph (A) shall be determined by the Secretary and shall approximate the marginal cost of care beyond the applicable cutoff point under such subparagraph. (C) Limit on aggregate outlier adjustments (i) In general The total of the additional payments made under this paragraph for covered OPD services furnished in a year (as estimated by the Secretary before the beginning of the year) may not exceed the applicable percentage (specified in clause (ii)) of the total program payments estimated to be made under this subsection for all covered OPD services furnished in that year. If this paragraph is first applied to less than a full year, the previous sentence shall apply only to the portion of such year. (ii) Applicable percentage For purposes of clause (i), the term \"applicable percentage\" means a percentage specified by the Secretary up to (but not to exceed)\u2014 (I) for a year (or portion of a year) before 2004, 2.5 percent; and (II) for 2004 and thereafter, 3.0 percent. (D) Transitional authority In applying subparagraph (A) for covered OPD services furnished before January 1, 2002, the Secretary may\u2014 (i) apply such subparagraph to a bill for such services related to an outpatient encounter (rather than for a specific service or group of services) using OPD fee schedule amounts and transitional pass-through payments covered under the bill; and (ii) use an appropriate cost-to-charge ratio for the hospital involved (as determined by the Secretary), rather than for specific departments within the hospital. (E) Exclusion of separate drug and biological APCS from outlier payments No additional payment shall be made under subparagraph (A) in the case of ambulatory payment classification groups established separately for drugs or biologicals. (6) Transitional pass-through for additional costs of innovative medical devices, drugs, and biologicals (A) In general The Secretary shall provide for an additional payment under this paragraph for any of the following that are provided as part of a covered OPD service (or group of services): (i) Current orphan drugs A drug or biological that is used for a rare disease or condition with respect to which the drug or biological has been designated as an orphan drug under (ii) Current cancer therapy drugs and biologicals and brachytherapy A drug or biological that is used in cancer therapy, including (but not limited to) a chemotherapeutic agent, an antiemetic, a hematopoietic growth factor, a colony stimulating factor, a biological response modifier, a bisphosphonate, and a device of brachytherapy or temperature monitored cryoablation, if payment for such drug, biological, or device as an outpatient hospital service under this part was being made on such first date.

(vi) For purposes of this subparagraph, a \"physician's actual charge\" for a physicians' service furnished in a year or other period is the weighted average (or, at the option of the Secretary for a service furnished in the calendar quarter beginning April 1, 1984, the median) of the physician's charges for such service furnished in the year or other period. (vii) In the case of a nonparticipating physician who was a participating physician during a previous period, for the purpose of computing the physician's maximum allowable actual charge during the physician's period of nonparticipation, the physician shall be deemed to have had a maximum allowable actual charge during the period of participation, and such deemed maximum allowable actual charge shall be determined according to clauses (i) through (vi).

No. 13948, Sept. 13, 2020, 85 F.R. 59649, provided: By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: In addition to being unfair, high drug prices in the United States also have serious economic and health consequences for patients in need of treatment. High prices cause Americans to divert too much of their scarce resources to pharmaceutical treatments and away from other productive uses. High prices are also a reason many patients skip doses of their medications, take less than the recommended doses, or abandon treatment altogether. The consequences of these behaviors can be severe. For example, patients may develop acute conditions that result in poor clinical outcomes or that require drastic and expensive medical interventions. In most markets, the largest buyers pay the lowest prices, but this has not been true for prescription drugs. The Federal Government is the largest payer for prescription drugs in the world, but it pays more than many smaller buyers, including other developed nations. When the Federal Government purchases a drug covered by Medicare\u2014the cost of which is shared by American seniors who take the drug and American taxpayers\u2014it should insist on, at a minimum, the lowest price at which the manufacturer sells that drug to any other developed nation. (b) The \"most-favored-nation price\" shall mean the lowest price, after adjusting for volume and differences in national gross domestic product, for a pharmaceutical product that the drug manufacturer sells in a member country of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) that has a comparable per-capita gross domestic product.

(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(ii) Practice expense relative value units The Secretary shall determine a number of practice expense relative value units for the service for years before 1999 equal to the product of\u2014 (I) the base allowed charges (as defined in subparagraph (D)) for the service, and (II) the practice expense percentage for the service (as determined under paragraph (3)(C)(ii)), and for years beginning with 1999 based on the relative practice expense resources involved in furnishing the service or group of services. For 1999, such number of units shall be determined based 75 percent on such product and based 25 percent on the relative practice expense resources involved in furnishing the service. For 2000, such number of units shall be determined based 50 percent on such product and based 50 percent on such relative practice expense resources. For 2001, such number of units shall be determined based 25 percent on such product and based 75 percent on such relative practice expense resources. For a subsequent year, such number of units shall be determined based entirely on such relative practice expense resources. (iii) Malpractice relative value units The Secretary shall determine a number of malpractice relative value units for the service or group of services for years before 2000 equal to the product of\u2014 (I) the base allowed charges (as defined in subparagraph (D)) for the service or group of services, and (II) the malpractice percentage for the service or group of services (as determined under paragraph (3)(C)(iii)), and for years beginning with 2000 based on the malpractice expense resources involved in furnishing the service or group of services. (D) \"Base allowed charges\" defined In this paragraph, the term \"base allowed charges\" means, with respect to a physician's service, the national average allowed charges for the service under this part for services furnished during 1991, as estimated by the Secretary using the most recent data available. (E) Reduction in practice expense relative value units for certain services (i) In general Subject to clause (ii), the Secretary shall reduce the practice expense relative value units applied to services described in clause (iii) furnished in\u2014 (I) 1994, by 25 percent of the number by which the number of practice expense relative value units (determined for 1994 without regard to this subparagraph) exceeds the number of work relative value units determined for 1994, (II) 1995, by an additional 25 percent of such excess, and (III) 1996, by an additional 25 percent of such excess. (ii) Floor on reductions The practice expense relative value units for a physician's service shall not be reduced under this subparagraph to a number less than 128 percent of the number of work relative value units. (iii) Services covered For purposes of clause (i), the services described in this clause are physicians' services that are not described in clause (iv) and for which\u2014 (I) there are work relative value units, and (II) the number of practice expense relative value units (determined for 1994) exceeds 128 percent of the number of work relative value units (determined for such year). (iv) Excluded services For purposes of clause (iii), the services described in this clause are services which the Secretary determines at least 75 percent of which are provided under this subchapter in an office setting. (F) Budget neutrality adjustments The Secretary\u2014 (i) shall reduce the relative values for all services (other than anesthesia services) established under this paragraph (and, in the case of anesthesia services, the conversion factor established by the Secretary for such services) by such percentage as the Secretary determines to be necessary so that, beginning in 1996, the amendment made by section 13514(a) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 would not result in expenditures under this section that exceed the amount of such expenditures that would have been made if such amendment had not been made, and (ii) shall reduce the amounts determined under subsection (a)(2)(B)(ii)(I) by such percentage as the Secretary determines to be required to assure that, taking into account the reductions made under clause (i), the amendment made by section 13514(a) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 would not result in expenditures under this section in 1994 that exceed the amount of such expenditures that would have been made if such amendment had not been made. (G) Adjustments in relative value units for 1998 (i) In general The Secretary shall\u2014 (I) subject to clauses (iv) and (v), reduce the practice expense relative value units applied to any services described in clause (ii) furnished in 1998 to a number equal to 110 percent of the number of work relative value units, and (II) increase the practice expense relative value units for office visit procedure codes during 1998 by a uniform percentage which the Secretary estimates will result in an aggregate increase in payments for such services equal to the aggregate decrease in payments by reason of subclause (I). (ii) Services covered For purposes of clause (i), the services described in this clause are physicians' services that are not described in clause (iii) and for which\u2014 (I) there are work relative value units, and (II) the number of practice expense relative value units (determined for 1998) exceeds 110 percent of the number of work relative value units (determined for such year). (iii) Excluded services For purposes of clause (ii), the services described in this clause are services which the Secretary determines at least 75 percent of which are provided under this subchapter in an office setting. (iv) Limitation on aggregate reallocation If the application of clause (i)(I) would result in an aggregate amount of reductions under such clause in excess of $390,000,000, such clause shall be applied by substituting for 110 percent such greater percentage as the Secretary estimates will result in the aggregate amount of such reductions equaling $390,000,000. (v) No reduction for certain services Practice expense relative value units for a procedure performed in an office or in a setting out of an office shall not be reduced under clause (i) if the in-office or out-of-office practice expense relative value, respectively, for the procedure would increase under the proposed rule on resource-based practice expenses issued by the Secretary on June 18, 1997 (62 Federal Register 33158 et seq.).

(III) Application This clause shall not apply with respect to a survey to which subparagraph (H)(i) applies. (J) Provisions for appropriate reporting and billing for physicians' services associated with the administration of covered outpatient drugs and biologicals (i) Evaluation of codes The Secretary shall promptly evaluate existing drug administration codes for physicians' services to ensure accurate reporting and billing for such services, taking into account levels of complexity of the administration and resource consumption. (ii) Use of existing processes In carrying out clause (i), the Secretary shall use existing processes for the consideration of coding changes and, to the extent coding changes are made, shall use such processes in establishing relative values for such services. (iii) Implementation In carrying out clause (i), the Secretary shall consult with representatives of physician specialties affected by the implementation of (iv) Subsequent, budget neutral adjustments permitted Nothing in subparagraph (H) or (I) or this subparagraph shall be construed as preventing the Secretary from providing for adjustments in practice expense relative value units under (and consistent with) subparagraph (B) for years after 2004, 2005, or 2006, respectively. (K) Potentially misvalued codes (i) In general The Secretary shall\u2014 (I) periodically identify services as being potentially misvalued using criteria specified in clause (ii); and (II) review and make appropriate adjustments to the relative values established under this paragraph for services identified as being potentially misvalued under subclause (I).

(O) Target for relative value adjustments for misvalued services With respect to fee schedules established for each of 2016 through 2018, the following shall apply: (i) Determination of net reduction in expenditures For each year, the Secretary shall determine the estimated net reduction in expenditures under the fee schedule under this section with respect to the year as a result of adjustments to the relative values established under this paragraph for misvalued codes. (ii) Budget neutral redistribution of funds if target met and counting overages towards the target for the succeeding year If the estimated net reduction in expenditures determined under clause (i) for the year is equal to or greater than the target for the year\u2014 (I) reduced expenditures attributable to such adjustments shall be redistributed for the year in a budget neutral manner in accordance with subparagraph (B)(ii)(II); and (II) the amount by which such reduced expenditures exceeds the target for the year shall be treated as a reduction in expenditures described in clause (i) for the succeeding year, for purposes of determining whether the target has or has not been met under this subparagraph with respect to that year. (iii) Exemption from budget neutrality if target not met If the estimated net reduction in expenditures determined under clause (i) for the year is less than the target for the year, reduced expenditures in an amount equal to the target recapture amount shall not be taken into account in applying subparagraph (B)(ii)(II) with respect to fee schedules beginning with 2016. (iv) Target recapture amount For purposes of clause (iii), the target recapture amount is, with respect to a year, an amount equal to the difference between\u2014 (I) the target for the year; and (II) the estimated net reduction in expenditures determined under clause (i) for the year. (v) Target For purposes of this subparagraph, with respect to a year, the target is calculated as 0.5 percent (or, for 2016, 1.0 percent) of the estimated amount of expenditures under the fee schedule under this section for the year. (3) Component percentages For purposes of paragraph (2), the Secretary shall determine a work percentage, a practice expense percentage, and a malpractice percentage for each physician's service as follows: (A) Division of services by specialty For each physician's service or class of physicians' services, the Secretary shall determine the average percentage of each such service or class of services that is performed, nationwide, under this part by physicians in each of the different physician specialties (as identified by the Secretary). (B) Division of specialty by component The Secretary shall determine the average percentage division of resources, among the work component, the practice expense component, and the malpractice component, used by physicians in each of such specialties in furnishing physicians' services. Such percentages shall be based on national data that describe the elements of physician practice costs and revenues, by physician specialty. The Secretary may use extrapolation and other techniques to determine practice costs and revenues for specialties for which adequate data are not available. (C) Determination of component percentages (i) Work percentage The work percentage for a service (or class of services) is equal to the sum (for all physician specialties) of\u2014 (I) the average percentage division for the work component for each physician specialty (determined under subparagraph (B)), multiplied by (II) the proportion (determined under subparagraph (A)) of such service (or services) performed by physicians in that specialty. (ii) Practice expense percentage For years before 2002, the practice expense percentage for a service (or class of services) is equal to the sum (for all physician specialties) of\u2014 (I) the average percentage division for the practice expense component for each physician specialty (determined under subparagraph (B)), multiplied by (II) the proportion (determined under subparagraph (A)) of such service (or services) performed by physicians in that specialty. (iii) Malpractice percentage For years before 1999, the malpractice percentage for a service (or class of services) is equal to the sum (for all physician specialties) of\u2014 (I) the average percentage division for the malpractice component for each physician specialty (determined under subparagraph (B)), multiplied by (II) the proportion (determined under subparagraph (A)) of such service (or services) performed by physicians in that specialty. (D) Periodic recomputation The Secretary may, from time to time, provide for the recomputation of work percentages, practice expense percentages, and malpractice percentages determined under this paragraph. (4) Ancillary policies The Secretary may establish ancillary policies (with respect to the use of modifiers, local codes, and other matters) as may be necessary to implement this section. (5) Coding The Secretary shall establish a uniform procedure coding system for the coding of all physicians' services. The Secretary shall provide for an appropriate coding structure for visits and consultations. The Secretary may incorporate the use of time in the coding for visits and consultations. The Secretary, in establishing such coding system, shall consult with the Physician Payment Review Commission and other organizations representing physicians. (6) No variation for specialists The Secretary may not vary the conversion factor or the number of relative value units for a physicians' service based on whether the physician furnishing the service is a specialist or based on the type of specialty of the physician. (7) Phase-in of significant relative value unit (RVU) reductions Effective for fee schedules established beginning with 2016, for services that are not new or revised codes, if the total relative value units for a service for a year would otherwise be decreased by an estimated amount equal to or greater than 20 percent as compared to the total relative value units for the previous year, the applicable adjustments in work, practice expense, and malpractice relative value units shall be phased-in over a 2-year period. (8) Global surgical packages (A) Prohibition of implementation of rule regarding global surgical packages (i) In general The Secretary shall not implement the policy established in the final rule published on November 13, 2014 (79 Fed. Reg. 67548 et seq.), that requires the transition of all 10-day and 90-day global surgery packages to 0-day global periods. (ii) Construction Nothing in clause (i) shall be construed to prevent the Secretary from revaluing misvalued codes for specific surgical services or assigning values to new or revised codes for surgical services. (B) Collection of data on services included in global surgical packages (i) In general Subject to clause (ii), the Secretary shall through rulemaking develop and implement a process to gather, from a representative sample of physicians, beginning not later than January 1, 2017, information needed to value surgical services. Such information shall include the number and level of medical visits furnished during the global period and other items and services related to the surgery and furnished during the global period, as appropriate. Such information shall be reported on claims at the end of the global period or in another manner specified by the Secretary. For purposes of carrying out this paragraph (other than clause (iii)), the Secretary shall transfer from the Federal Supplemental Medical Insurance Trust Fund under (ii) Reassessment and potential sunset Every 4 years, the Secretary shall reassess the value of the information collected pursuant to clause (i). Based on such a reassessment and by regulation, the Secretary may discontinue the requirement for collection of information under such clause if the Secretary determines that the Secretary has adequate information from other sources, such as qualified clinical data registries, surgical logs, billing systems or other practice or facility records, and electronic health records, in order to accurately value global surgical services under this section. (iii) Inspector general audit The Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services shall audit a sample of the information reported under clause (i) to verify the accuracy of the information so reported. (C) Improving accuracy of pricing for surgical services For years beginning with 2019, the Secretary shall use the information reported under subparagraph (B)(i) as appropriate and other available data for the purpose of improving the accuracy of valuation of surgical services under the physician fee schedule under this section. (d) Conversion factors (1) Establishment (A) In general The conversion factor for each year shall be the conversion factor established under this subsection for the previous year (or, in the case of 1992, specified in subparagraph (B)) adjusted by the update (established under paragraph (3)) for the year involved (for years before 2001) and, for years beginning with 2001 and ending with 2025, multiplied by the update (established under paragraph (4) or a subsequent paragraph) for the year involved. There shall be two separate conversion factors for each year beginning with 2026, one for items and services furnished by a qualifying APM participant (as defined in (B) Special provision for 1992 For purposes of subparagraph (A), the conversion factor specified in this subparagraph is a conversion factor (determined by the Secretary) which, if this section were to apply during 1991 using such conversion factor, would result in the same aggregate amount of payments under this part for physicians' services as the estimated aggregate amount of the payments under this part for such services in 1991. (C) Special rules for 1998 Except as provided in subparagraph (D), the single conversion factor for 1998 under this subsection shall be the conversion factor for primary care services for 1997, increased by the Secretary's estimate of the weighted average of the three separate updates that would otherwise occur were it not for the enactment of (D) Special rules for anesthesia services The separate conversion factor for anesthesia services for a year shall be equal to 46 percent of the single conversion factor (or, beginning with 2026, applicable conversion factor) established for other physicians' services, except as adjusted for changes in work, practice expense, or malpractice relative value units. (E) Publication and dissemination of information The Secretary shall\u2014 (i) cause to have published in the Federal Register not later than November 1 of each year (beginning with 2000) the conversion factor which will apply to physicians' services for the succeeding year, the update determined under paragraph (4) for such succeeding year, and the allowed expenditures under such paragraph for such succeeding year; and (ii) make available to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and the public by March 1 of each year (beginning with 2000) an estimate of the sustainable growth rate and of the conversion factor which will apply to physicians' services for the succeeding year and data used in making such estimate. (2) Repealed. Pub. L. 105-33, title IV, \u00a74502(b), Aug. 5, 1997, 111 Stat. 433 (3) Update for 1999 and 2000 (A) In general Unless otherwise provided by law, subject to subparagraph (D) and the budget-neutrality factor determined by the Secretary under subsection (c)(2)(B)(ii), the update to the single conversion factor established in paragraph (1)(C) for 1999 and 2000 is equal to the product of\u2014 (i) 1 plus the Secretary's estimate of the percentage increase in the MEI (as defined in (ii) 1 plus the Secretary's estimate of the update adjustment factor for the year (divided by 100), minus 1 and multiplied by 100. (B) Update adjustment factor For purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii), the \"update adjustment factor\" for a year is equal (as estimated by the Secretary) to\u2014 (i) the difference between (I) the sum of the allowed expenditures for physicians' services (as determined under subparagraph (C)) for the period beginning April 1, 1997, and ending on March 31 of the year involved, and (II) the amount of actual expenditures for physicians' services furnished during the period beginning April 1, 1997, and ending on March 31 of the preceding year; divided by (ii) the actual expenditures for physicians' services for the 12-month period ending on March 31 of the preceding year, increased by the sustainable growth rate under subsection (f) for the fiscal year which begins during such 12-month period. (C) Determination of allowed expenditures For purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (4), the allowed expenditures for physicians' services for the 12-month period ending with March 31 of\u2014 (i) 1997 is equal to the actual expenditures for physicians' services furnished during such 12-month period, as estimated by the Secretary; or (ii) a subsequent year is equal to the allowed expenditures for physicians' services for the previous year, increased by the sustainable growth rate under subsection (f) for the fiscal year which begins during such 12-month period. (D) Restriction on variation from medicare economic index Notwithstanding the amount of the update adjustment factor determined under subparagraph (B) for a year, the update in the conversion factor under this paragraph for the year may not be\u2014 (i) greater than 100 times the following amount: (1.03 + (MEI percentage/100)) 1; or (ii) less than 100 times the following amount: (0.93 + (MEI percentage/100)) 1, where \"MEI percentage\" means the Secretary's estimate of the percentage increase in the MEI (as defined in (4) Update for years beginning with 2001 and ending with 2014 (A) In general Unless otherwise provided by law, subject to the budget-neutrality factor determined by the Secretary under subsection (c)(2)(B)(ii) and subject to adjustment under subparagraph (F), the update to the single conversion factor established in paragraph (1)(C) for a year beginning with 2001 and ending with 2014 is equal to the product of\u2014 (i) 1 plus the Secretary's estimate of the percentage increase in the MEI (as defined in (ii) 1 plus the Secretary's estimate of the update adjustment factor under subparagraph (B) for the year. (B) Update adjustment factor For purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii), subject to subparagraph (D) and the succeeding paragraphs of this subsection, the \"update adjustment factor\" for a year is equal (as estimated by the Secretary) to the sum of the following: (i) Prior year adjustment component An amount determined by\u2014 (I) computing the difference (which may be positive or negative) between the amount of the allowed expenditures for physicians' services for the prior year (as determined under subparagraph (C)) and the amount of the actual expenditures for such services for that year; (II) dividing that difference by the amount of the actual expenditures for such services for that year; and (III) multiplying that quotient by 0.75. (ii) Cumulative adjustment component An amount determined by\u2014 (I) computing the difference (which may be positive or negative) between the amount of the allowed expenditures for physicians' services (as determined under subparagraph (C)) from April 1, 1996, through the end of the prior year and the amount of the actual expenditures for such services during that period; (II) dividing that difference by actual expenditures for such services for the prior year as increased by the sustainable growth rate under subsection (f) for the year for which the update adjustment factor is to be determined; and (III) multiplying that quotient by 0.33. (C) Determination of allowed expenditures For purposes of this paragraph: (i) Period up to April 1, 1999 The allowed expenditures for physicians' services for a period before April 1, 1999, shall be the amount of the allowed expenditures for such period as determined under paragraph (3)(C). (ii) Transition to calendar year allowed expenditures Subject to subparagraph (E), the allowed expenditures for\u2014 (I) the 9-month period beginning April 1, 1999, shall be the Secretary's estimate of the amount of the allowed expenditures that would be permitted under paragraph (3)(C) for such period; and (II) the year of 1999, shall be the Secretary's estimate of the amount of the allowed expenditures that would be permitted under paragraph (3)(C) for such year.

In this subsection, such performance period (or periods) for a year shall be referred to as the performance period for the year. (5) Composite performance score (A) In general Subject to the succeeding provisions of this paragraph and taking into account, as available and applicable, paragraph (1)(G), the Secretary shall develop a methodology for assessing the total performance of each MIPS eligible professional according to performance standards under paragraph (3) with respect to applicable measures and activities specified in paragraph (2)(B) with respect to each performance category applicable to such professional for a performance period (as established under paragraph (4)) for a year. Using such methodology, the Secretary shall provide for a composite assessment (using a scoring scale of 0 to 100) for each such professional for the performance period for such year. In this subsection such a composite assessment for such a professional with respect to a performance period shall be referred to as the \"composite performance score\" for such professional for such performance period. (B) Incentive to report; encouraging use of certified EHR technology for reporting quality measures (i) Incentive to report Under the methodology established under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall provide that in the case of a MIPS eligible professional who fails to report on an applicable measure or activity that is required to be reported by the professional, the professional shall be treated as achieving the lowest potential score applicable to such measure or activity. (ii) Encouraging use of certified EHR technology and qualified clinical data registries for reporting quality measures Under the methodology established under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall\u2014 (I) encourage MIPS eligible professionals to report on applicable measures with respect to the performance category described in paragraph (2)(A)(i) through the use of certified EHR technology and qualified clinical data registries; and (II) with respect to a performance period, with respect to a year, for which a MIPS eligible professional reports such measures through the use of such EHR technology, treat such professional as satisfying the clinical quality measures reporting requirement described in subsection (o)(2)(A)(iii) for such year. (C) Clinical practice improvement activities performance score (i) Rule for certification A MIPS eligible professional who is in a practice that is certified as a patient-centered medical home or comparable specialty practice, as determined by the Secretary, with respect to a performance period shall be given the highest potential score for the performance category described in paragraph (2)(A)(iii) for such period. (ii) APM participation Participation by a MIPS eligible professional in an alternative payment model (as defined in (iii) Subcategories A MIPS eligible professional shall not be required to perform activities in each subcategory under paragraph (2)(B)(iii) or participate in an alternative payment model in order to achieve the highest potential score for the performance category described in paragraph (2)(A)(iii). (D) Achievement and improvement (i) Taking into account improvement Beginning with the second year to which the MIPS applies, in addition to the achievement of a MIPS eligible professional, if data sufficient to measure improvement is available, the methodology developed under subparagraph (A)\u2014 (I) in the case of the performance score for the performance category described in clauses (i) and (ii) of paragraph (2)(A), subject to clause (iii), shall take into account the improvement of the professional; and (II) in the case of performance scores for other performance categories, may take into account the improvement of the professional. (ii) Assigning higher weight for achievement Subject to clause (i), under the methodology developed under subparagraph (A), the Secretary may assign a higher scoring weight under subparagraph (F) with respect to the achievement of a MIPS eligible professional than with respect to any improvement of such professional applied under clause (i) with respect to a measure, activity, or category described in paragraph (2). (iii) Transition years For each of the second, third, fourth, and fifth years for which the MIPS applies to payments, the performance score for the performance category described in paragraph (2)(A)(ii) shall not take into account the improvement of the professional involved. (E) Weights for the performance categories (i) In general Under the methodology developed under subparagraph (A), subject to subparagraph (F)(i) and clause (ii), the composite performance score shall be determined as follows: (I) Quality (aa) In general Subject to item (bb), thirty percent of such score shall be based on performance with respect to the category described in clause (i) of paragraph (2)(A). In applying the previous sentence, the Secretary shall, as feasible, encourage the application of outcome measures within such category. (bb) First 5 years For each of the first through fifth years for which the MIPS applies to payments, the percentage applicable under item (aa) shall be increased in a manner such that the total percentage points of the increase under this item for the respective year equals the total number of percentage points by which the percentage applied under subclause (II)(bb) for the respective year is less than 30 percent. (II) Resource use (aa) In general Subject to item (bb), thirty percent of such score shall be based on performance with respect to the category described in clause (ii) of paragraph (2)(A). (bb) First 5 years For the first year for which the MIPS applies to payments, not more than 10 percent of such score shall be based on performance with respect to the category described in clause (ii) of paragraph (2)(A). For each of the second, third, fourth, and fifth years for which the MIPS applies to payments, not less than 10 percent and not more than 30 percent of such score shall be based on performance with respect to the category described in clause (ii) of paragraph (2)(A). Nothing in the previous sentence shall be construed, with respect to a performance period for a year described in the previous sentence, as preventing the Secretary from basing 30 percent of such score for such year with respect to the category described in such clause (ii), if the Secretary determines, based on information posted under subsection (r)(2)(I) that sufficient resource use measures are ready for adoption for use under the performance category under paragraph (2)(A)(ii) for such performance period. (III) Clinical practice improvement activities Fifteen percent of such score shall be based on performance with respect to the category described in clause (iii) of paragraph (2)(A). (IV) Meaningful use of certified EHR technology Twenty-five percent of such score shall be based on performance with respect to the category described in clause (iv) of paragraph (2)(A). (ii) Authority to adjust percentages in case of high EHR meaningful use adoption In any year in which the Secretary estimates that the proportion of eligible professionals (as defined in subsection (o)(5)) who are meaningful EHR users (as determined under subsection (o)(2)) is 75 percent or greater, the Secretary may reduce the percent applicable under clause (i)(IV), but not below 15 percent. If the Secretary makes such reduction for a year, subject to subclauses (I)(bb) and (II)(bb) of clause (i), the percentages applicable under one or more of subclauses (I), (II), and (III) of clause (i) for such year shall be increased in a manner such that the total percentage points of the increase under this clause for such year equals the total number of percentage points reduced under the preceding sentence for such year. (F) Certain flexibility for weighting performance categories, measures, and activities Under the methodology under subparagraph (A), if there are not sufficient measures and activities (described in paragraph (2)(B)) applicable and available to each type of eligible professional involved, the Secretary shall assign different scoring weights (including a weight of 0)\u2014 (i) which may vary from the scoring weights specified in subparagraph (E), for each performance category based on the extent to which the category is applicable to the type of eligible professional involved; and (ii) for each measure and activity specified under paragraph (2)(B) with respect to each such category based on the extent to which the measure or activity is applicable and available to the type of eligible professional involved. (G) Resource use Analysis of the performance category described in paragraph (2)(A)(ii) shall include results from the methodology described in subsection (r)(5), as appropriate. (H) Inclusion of quality measure data from other payers In applying subsections (k), (m), and (p) with respect to measures described in paragraph (2)(B)(i), analysis of the performance category described in paragraph (2)(A)(i) may include data submitted by MIPS eligible professionals with respect to items and services furnished to individuals who are not individuals entitled to benefits under part A or enrolled under part B. (I) Use of voluntary virtual groups for certain assessment purposes (i) In general In the case of MIPS eligible professionals electing to be a virtual group under clause (ii) with respect to a performance period for a year, for purposes of applying the methodology under subparagraph (A) with respect to the performance categories described in clauses (i) and (ii) of paragraph (2)(A)\u2014 (I) the assessment of performance provided under such methodology with respect to such performance categories that is to be applied to each such professional in such group for such performance period shall be with respect to the combined performance of all such professionals in such group for such period; and (II) with respect to the composite performance score provided under this paragraph for such performance period for each such MIPS eligible professional in such virtual group, the components of the composite performance score that assess performance with respect to such performance categories shall be based on the assessment of the combined performance under subclause (I) for such performance categories and performance period. (ii) Election of practices to be a virtual group The Secretary shall, in accordance with the requirements under clause (iii), establish and have in place a process to allow an individual MIPS eligible professional or a group practice consisting of not more than 10 MIPS eligible professionals to elect, with respect to a performance period for a year to be a virtual group under this subparagraph with at least one other such individual MIPS eligible professional or group practice. Such a virtual group may be based on appropriate classifications of providers, such as by geographic areas or by provider specialties defined by nationally recognized specialty boards of certification or equivalent certification boards. (iii) Requirements The requirements for the process under clause (ii) shall\u2014 (I) provide that an election under such clause, with respect to a performance period, shall be made before the beginning of such performance period and may not be changed during such performance period; (II) provide that an individual MIPS eligible professional and a group practice described in clause (ii) may elect to be in no more than one virtual group for a performance period and that, in the case of such a group practice that elects to be in such virtual group for such performance period, such election applies to all MIPS eligible professionals in such group practice; (III) provide that a virtual group be a combination of tax identification numbers; (IV) provide for formal written agreements among MIPS eligible professionals electing to be a virtual group under this subparagraph; and (V) include such other requirements as the Secretary determines appropriate. (6) MIPS payments (A) MIPS adjustment factor Taking into account paragraph (1)(G), the Secretary shall specify a MIPS adjustment factor for each MIPS eligible professional for a year. Such MIPS adjustment factor for a MIPS eligible professional for a year shall be in the form of a percent and shall be determined\u2014 (i) by comparing the composite performance score of the eligible professional for such year to the performance threshold established under subparagraph (D)(i) for such year; (ii) in a manner such that the adjustment factors specified under this subparagraph for a year result in differential payments under this paragraph reflecting that\u2014 (I) MIPS eligible professionals with composite performance scores for such year at or above such performance threshold for such year receive zero or positive payment adjustment factors for such year in accordance with clause (iii), with such professionals having higher composite performance scores receiving higher adjustment factors; and (II) MIPS eligible professionals with composite performance scores for such year below such performance threshold for such year receive negative payment adjustment factors for such year in accordance with clause (iv), with such professionals having lower composite performance scores receiving lower adjustment factors; (iii) in a manner such that MIPS eligible professionals with composite scores described in clause (ii)(I) for such year, subject to clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (F), receive a zero or positive adjustment factor on a linear sliding scale such that an adjustment factor of 0 percent is assigned for a score at the performance threshold and an adjustment factor of the applicable percent specified in subparagraph (B) is assigned for a score of 100; and (iv) in a manner such that\u2014 (I) subject to subclause (II), MIPS eligible professionals with composite performance scores described in clause (ii)(II) for such year receive a negative payment adjustment factor on a linear sliding scale such that an adjustment factor of 0 percent is assigned for a score at the performance threshold and an adjustment factor of the negative of the applicable percent specified in subparagraph (B) is assigned for a score of 0; and (II) MIPS eligible professionals with composite performance scores that are equal to or greater than 0, but not greater than \u00bc of the performance threshold specified under subparagraph (D)(i) for such year, receive a negative payment adjustment factor that is equal to the negative of the applicable percent specified in subparagraph (B) for such year. (B) Applicable percent defined For purposes of this paragraph, the term \"applicable percent\" means\u2014 (i) for 2019, 4 percent; (ii) for 2020, 5 percent; (iii) for 2021, 7 percent; and (iv) for 2022 and subsequent years, 9 percent. (C) Additional MIPS adjustment factors for exceptional performance For 2019 and each subsequent year through 2024, in the case of a MIPS eligible professional with a composite performance score for a year at or above the additional performance threshold under subparagraph (D)(ii) for such year, in addition to the MIPS adjustment factor under subparagraph (A) for the eligible professional for such year, subject to subparagraph (F)(iv), the Secretary shall specify an additional positive MIPS adjustment factor for such professional and year. Such additional MIPS adjustment factors shall be in the form of a percent and determined by the Secretary in a manner such that professionals having higher composite performance scores above the additional performance threshold receive higher additional MIPS adjustment factors. (D) Establishment of performance thresholds (i) Performance threshold For each year of the MIPS, the Secretary shall compute a performance threshold with respect to which the composite performance score of MIPS eligible professionals shall be compared for purposes of determining adjustment factors under subparagraph (A) that are positive, negative, and zero. Subject to clauses (iii) and (iv), such performance threshold for a year shall be the mean or median (as selected by the Secretary) of the composite performance scores for all MIPS eligible professionals with respect to a prior period specified by the Secretary. The Secretary may reassess the selection of the mean or median under the previous sentence every 3 years. (ii) Additional performance threshold for exceptional performance In addition to the performance threshold under clause (i), for each year of the MIPS (beginning with 2019 and ending with 2024), the Secretary shall compute an additional performance threshold for purposes of determining the additional MIPS adjustment factors under subparagraph (C). For each such year, subject to clause (iii), the Secretary shall apply either of the following methods for computing such additional performance threshold for such a year: (I) The threshold shall be the score that is equal to the 25th percentile of the range of possible composite performance scores above the performance threshold determined under clause (i). (II) The threshold shall be the score that is equal to the 25th percentile of the actual composite performance scores for MIPS eligible professionals with composite performance scores at or above the performance threshold with respect to the prior period described in clause (i). (iii) Special rule for initial 5 years With respect to each of the first five years to which the MIPS applies, the Secretary shall, prior to the performance period for such years, establish a performance threshold for purposes of determining MIPS adjustment factors under subparagraph (A) and a threshold for purposes of determining additional MIPS adjustment factors under subparagraph (C). Each such performance threshold shall\u2014 (I) be based on a period prior to such performance periods; and (II) take into account\u2014 (aa) data available with respect to performance on measures and activities that may be used under the performance categories under subparagraph (2)(B); and (bb) other factors determined appropriate by the Secretary. (iv) Additional special rule for third, fourth and fifth years of MIPS For purposes of determining MIPS adjustment factors under subparagraph (A), in addition to the requirements specified in clause (iii), the Secretary shall increase the performance threshold with respect to each of the third, fourth, and fifth years to which the MIPS applies to ensure a gradual and incremental transition to the performance threshold described in clause (i) (as estimated by the Secretary) with respect to the sixth year to which the MIPS applies. (E) Application of MIPS adjustment factors In the case of covered professional services (as defined in subsection (k)(3)(A)) furnished by a MIPS eligible professional during a year (beginning with 2019), the amount otherwise paid under this part with respect to such covered professional services and MIPS eligible professional for such year, shall be multiplied by\u2014 (i) 1, plus (ii) the sum of\u2014 (I) the MIPS adjustment factor determined under subparagraph (A) divided by 100, and (II) as applicable, the additional MIPS adjustment factor determined under subparagraph (C) divided by 100. (F) Aggregate application of MIPS adjustment factors (i) Application of scaling factor (I) In general With respect to positive MIPS adjustment factors under subparagraph (A)(ii)(I) for eligible professionals whose composite performance score is above the performance threshold under subparagraph (D)(i) for such year, subject to subclause (II), the Secretary shall increase or decrease such adjustment factors by a scaling factor in order to ensure that the budget neutrality requirement of clause (ii) is met. (II) Scaling factor limit In no case may the scaling factor applied under this clause exceed 3.0. (ii) Budget neutrality requirement (I) In general Subject to clause (iii), the Secretary shall ensure that the estimated amount described in subclause (II) for a year is equal to the estimated amount described in subclause (III) for such year. (II) Aggregate increases The amount described in this subclause is the estimated increase in the aggregate allowed charges resulting from the application of positive MIPS adjustment factors under subparagraph (A) (after application of the scaling factor described in clause (i)) to MIPS eligible professionals whose composite performance score for a year is above the performance threshold under subparagraph (D)(i) for such year. (III) Aggregate decreases The amount described in this subclause is the estimated decrease in the aggregate allowed charges resulting from the application of negative MIPS adjustment factors under subparagraph (A) to MIPS eligible professionals whose composite performance score for a year is below the performance threshold under subparagraph (D)(i) for such year. (iii) Exceptions (I) In the case that all MIPS eligible professionals receive composite performance scores for a year that are below the performance threshold under subparagraph (D)(i) for such year, the negative MIPS adjustment factors under subparagraph (A) shall apply with respect to such MIPS eligible professionals and the budget neutrality requirement of clause (ii) and the additional adjustment factors under clause (iv) shall not apply for such year. (II) In the case that, with respect to a year, the application of clause (i) results in a scaling factor equal to the maximum scaling factor specified in clause (i)(II), such scaling factor shall apply and the budget neutrality requirement of clause (ii) shall not apply for such year. (iv) Additional incentive payment adjustments (I) In general Subject to subclause (II), in specifying the MIPS additional adjustment factors under subparagraph (C) for each applicable MIPS eligible professional for a year, the Secretary shall ensure that the estimated aggregate increase in payments under this part resulting from the application of such additional adjustment factors for MIPS eligible professionals in a year shall be equal (as estimated by the Secretary) to $500,000,000 for each year beginning with 2019 and ending with 2024. (II) Limitation on additional incentive payment adjustments The MIPS additional adjustment factor under subparagraph (C) for a year for an applicable MIPS eligible professional whose composite performance score is above the additional performance threshold under subparagraph (D)(ii) for such year shall not exceed 10 percent. The application of the previous sentence may result in an aggregate amount of additional incentive payments that are less than the amount specified in subclause (I). (7) Announcement of result of adjustments Under the MIPS, the Secretary shall, not later than 30 days prior to January 1 of the year involved, make available to MIPS eligible professionals the MIPS adjustment factor (and, as applicable, the additional MIPS adjustment factor) under paragraph (6) applicable to the eligible professional for covered professional services (as defined in subsection (k)(3)(A)) furnished by the professional for such year. The Secretary may include such information in the confidential feedback under paragraph (12). (8) No effect in subsequent years The MIPS adjustment factors and additional MIPS adjustment factors under paragraph (6) shall apply only with respect to the year involved, and the Secretary shall not take into account such adjustment factors in making payments to a MIPS eligible professional under this part in a subsequent year.
