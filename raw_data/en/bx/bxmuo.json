An interdisciplinary team of IU Southeast faculty and staff, in conjunction with local experts, offer presentations related to Mental Health and Wellness designed for all, whether currently impacted or wanting to know more about good mental health practices. Description of the video:Welcome to the 2020 mental health and wellness seminar series on race and wellbeing. I'm Kelly Ryan, executive vice chancellor of academic affairs, into faculty colleague. The mental health and wellness seminar series was started like sappy to raise awareness about mental health issues and to reduce the stigma about mental illness on our campus and in the surrounding community. This series brings together local experts to discuss problems with colorblindness as an ideology, racial healing, ways to be an anti-racist and personal experiences of racism or discrimination. This work has never been more important as we address inequality in our community in the wake of national protests. But also as the pandemic ravages communities of color with greater Fanon. The work here connects to our core values that I saw Sophie's creating nurturing environments, supporting Holistic Learning, acting with integrity, and creating connections. This work cannot be done when certain members of our community who are undervalued or unheard. Thank you to each of the speakers for sharing their experiences on these important topics. Antony, organizers who took the time and maintain the dedication to make this work. I hope you will join the presentations and grabbed from. Good afternoon everybody. My name is Morgan windy and Oliver here to discuss with you today the ideology of color blindness. Have an ideology impacts goodbye community. And what we need to do to really rise above that, that the term of ID at the time of colorblindness and that ideology. So I'm going to tell you a little bit about myself. I'm also, as you can see, joined by my two dogs because currently my my offices, my home. So I don't mind. Maybe they could contribute something in a bit, but a little bit about myself professionally full-time. I work for the Indiana Coalition and sexual assault human trafficking. I am there statewide SART coordinator. And so my job is to ensure that every county in the state of Indiana has a sexual assault response team that's made up of prosecutors, advocates, law enforcement, and sexual assault nurse examiners, as well as other community members or community agencies that work with survivors of sexual violence and bring them to the table so that they can address sexual violence and have a coordinated response that is trauma-informed, culturally fluent, and survivor-centered in their community. So that's what I do full-time and the state of Indiana. I also am co-founder or program called state safety student advocates for exploited and trafficked youth. And the goal of that program is to implement leadership tools and abilities within youth and communities so that they can be advocates for other folks who may be experiencing sexual violence, as well as educate their communities on sexual violence. And lastly. You know, social workers were a bunch of hot. So I also am Co-chair of the southern any anti-human trafficking Coalition. And I had been for the past four years and work on bringing in education and to sudden Indiana around human trafficking, how to respond, how to report, what to look for, as well as trying to agencies to to respond to human trafficking survivors. So that's what I do in my professional life and I've been working within the skill for eight plus years. However, I think it's also important for you to know a little bit about me personally because I bring a lived I into this conversation we're having today. And I know that this this conversation we're having an eye really create a training that I do with sexual violence programs and other programs on why it's important to build culturally fluent programming and why it's important to break down the ideology of colorblindness to better serve the black community. So just know that, know that that's kind of where the basis of this presentation came from. But regardless, what's important to know about me personally is number one, I am a trans racial adopt Dee, I was adopted to two lesbian white women in Harrison County, Indiana and folks who are familiar, that is a small rural community. And so growing up as one, if not the only person of color than my community and tagging diverse family. It definitely came with its level of experiences and challenges as I was growing up and really shaped me to be who I am today. So just know that, you know, I've really kind of witnessed and felt racism on many different levels. And what really was the turning point for me when it came to addressing race and addressing barriers and systemic oppression that we experience was when I became a survivor of sexual violence, interpersonal violence. And so that's really why I feel this conversation is important for us to have and why I want to bring it to you today. And just to challenge the thought process that we have, not make you feel any shame for you or what you believe, but really plan to see for change. So I'm excited to be here and have this conversation with you. So color blindness as an ideology. When I do this presentation for programs and for, for fault staff always asked, asked individuals to think about color blindness when they first heard that term. If they ever experienced the rubber phrases that they can relate to and a thought about colorblindness. And it's been, I would invite you to do that right now. Just think to yourself, maybe personally, what, what you associate with the term colorblindness. And what's really been interesting is that when I bring that up and I have people give me feedback, you know, we have folks who are young, who maybe just joined the movements and, and change recently. And so they have their own maybe thought process or experience with the term color blindness. All the way to people who say, I remember my parents talking about colorblindness in the fifties. This is what we meant by it. So it's always interesting. You just, just think about how have you ever had an experience with that term and ideology. I know for me personally, you know, like I said, I grew up in an all-white community within all my family. And race is not something we normally talk about. And so I was often fall into thoughts. Well, races I something we need to bring up a topic or it's not important that we haven't conversation. But like I said later, I especially when I became a survivor, I learned that and the, the terminology to be discussed and really kind of brought down. So the target that the definition I want to give you all today just to work with as we're having and building this conversation, is that colorblindness is an ideology that suggest the best way to end discrimination is treating individuals as equally as possible without regard to race, culture, or ethnicity. And say, you know, like ice, right? You may think of terms or you may think phrases, right? You've heard in regards to colorblindness, I know a lot that I used here were things like, I do not see color. We're all equal classes. Obviously, racism. Race doesn't matter, either. Race and the human race. And one that I hear even more commonly is, Why can't we just stop complaining to get along? And especially with social media and people putting, you know, social media are utilizing social media as a way to speak out. And that's been a very common phrase I've heard come up more and more. But the reality is, and, but what I hope to plant a seed in, in your, your all's mind today is that the realities like Howard blindness does not work. There's a couple of reasons why you may even be able to take a more reasons why you don't think it works. But I want to leave you with a few. So number one, it really does create this absence of privilege. So it just eliminates the idea that there are people who are born into our country who have a different set of rights, who may have a different set of freedom, and who also have a different side of safety that they experience in their daily life, all due to the color of their skin. And if we really say race doesn't matter, the reality is, is that you can say that but, you know, when we go out as as a person of color and someone pulls us over and I'm sitting there thinking, I hope no matter what I do, I hope that I can walk out of this situation alive. Whereas my white counterparts may say I'm just worried about what or how expensive the tickets going to be. And so whatever you have this ideology, color blindness, you completely negate that, that reality that we have in our world, which brings me to another quaint, colorblindness really does eliminate any negative and positive experiences that the black community has like to share with you being pulled over or the fact that we can walk down the street and someone they cross the other side because they don't feel safe walking next to us. Those are real and those are real things that we experience and we see more and more of a conversation. More. Now, especially with everything going on in our country about what is it that, why people are saying, what is it that we've, we feel when we know that we are not getting you from our society and from our communities that we need to be heard and feel safe. And so again, colorblindness brings up this idea that that's, that's not real. That all of our safety is the same in all of our experiences that we go out into the world and experience the same. Another thing that it does is it rejects our cultural and historical context. And I'm going to talk about that briefly in just a minute in terms of historical trauma and why black community has experienced. But what do you say color doesn't matter? You're talking about a whole ancestral past, bad. That is, you need to brown people as he needs a black community. And we celebrate that and should be able to celebrate that. It's not something that anyone else can experience. When you say that race doesn't matter it's, it's bringing up this idea that we all have the same historical experiences, we haven't. And more importantly, we have historical experience that we want to celebrate that is different. And we should be able to do that. So, again those are just some insights into why that, why determine the ideology it can be damaging. And we're going to talk about that a little bit more. In a way I just want to give a little bit of insight into that, is briefly discussing the historical trauma that the black community has faced. So for folks who may not be aware, the term historical trauma was coined by Dr. Maria Yellow Horse Braveheart and who was a PhD. And what she was wanting to do was to figure out why indigenous populations were not engaging services, or engaging systems. And so she went out, did research, talked to people. What she found is that, indigenous individuals were not engaging systems and services because of the experiences that their ancestors had when they engaged services, when they were engaged by the state, or engaged by government. And they said historically our, our, our people have not been treated well. We've been discriminated against, we've been harmed, so we're not going to continue that, that interaction. So I think it really speaks and it really does provide insight into the black community. Why is it that we feel and we know that we are targeted by police? Why is it that we don't feel safe calling the police when we're in danger. Why is it that we may not go to a non-profit to get services. Is there a trust there that's been broken from previous experiences? And so I think it's good to understand that again, when we think of colorblindness, it negates that reality of historical trauma, it negates, why you may not see people of color walking into your school and walking into your church, or walking into your restaurants or walking into your police office or police station. So just briefly, I really, what I want to hit home here is that the black community has experienced generations and generations and generations of trauma. And trauma really has not been fully addressed as it should be. So, you know, raging back from 1619 will be high. Black slaves brought to this country. We were rates tortured, killed, and stripped away from our families. And another really heavy thing that happened was we are stripped away from our culture. We came from a society, a matriarchs, and we were forced into a patriarchal society. We are forced to take on different names, different cultural experiences. And so there was a lot of lost those experienced by the black community at that time. It's important to know that. It's important to remember that that happens. Later on. We hide things like the 13th amendment come in. I'm giving it rights and ending slavery wishes what we were told, However, what we saw come in place and that was something known as complexly share, sharecropping. Where literally farmers could pay prisons to write out. Inmates who, particularly at that time between 18651965, were black. And so the reality is yes, the 13th Amendment was passed, but we were still being slaves. And that is something that we're still experiencing today. Confidently sharecropping has not ended. I was still a form of slavery. We see happening, we also see situations happening within the Jim Crow era. We saw were, where's the rise of the Ku Klux Klan were literally being targeted and killed just because of the color of our skin. Nothing else has to happen. And even after we were set free, we had over 4 thousand black Americans killed in the South due to lynching in the colliculus plan, and a little over 200 that were killed him. Nor so again, rights were given, were say, we're told that were more equal. Whoa, whoa, but we're still dine and we're still beating slides later on. And as we've seen moving into now generations, we saw blacks were moving into cities and saying, oh, medium jobs, but were still segregated in parts of the city. They were still segregated within their jobs. They were told, you know, you can work here, but there's really no advancement possible for a black individual. So again, this, this false idea that you get a job, you get to come here, you get to live in the city, but are you really being treated equally and fairly to everybody else? Are you so given the same opportunities and access to justice and prosperity to everybody else's. And the reality is now. And then, even within those generations, we saw things like drug use that was used as a reason that we needed to increase police within black communities. But the reality is that white communities and black movies we're using is selling drugs at the same rate. But black communities were being forced into prisons at 20 times more than white people doing the same thing. So again, the reality and what I want to hit home for generations and generations of traumas that it's still there. It's still something that weeks have experience to somebody. We still experience a fully effects on today. And that's really why ACOs fighting in the streets right now. We have to claim that freedom. We have to get that freedom because it's something that we'd never truly have ever had. So where I want to cut. Touch on briefly right now because I know that your time is limited. Again, those generations of trauma where we are now, we're still seen that and we're still seeing the effects of that within our communities. Here's a couple things I want to hit home. An estimated 20.1, 29% of African-American females are victimized by intimate partner violence in their lifetime. That can be rate physical assault or of stopping black boys are almost three times as likely to be suspended than white boys. And black girls are almost four times more likely to be suspended than white girls from school. Approximately 8% of people in federal prison and almost 60% of people in state prisons for drug offenses and black or Latino. And 2018, the voice of blacks Cincinnati found that despite protections, despite protections, 52% of all juvenile prostitution arrests are African-American. And what's even more important to know and I, in those, in that situation is that penalties associated with trafficking young black girls is lesser if you're caught than if you're caught tracking a young white girl. So lot of times people will want to traffic black girls because if they're caught, they're going to serve less time. In 2019, a study published in the Journal of Community Health found the rate of suicide deaths among black males increased 60% from 2001 through 2017. Researchers also documented on 182% increase in the rate of suicide deaths among young black females during the same time period. That time period being 2001 to 2017. That's where we are today. That's the reality of the built up trauma that our community is felt today. And we have to have a response and we have to change. We have to acknowledge that black people and our culture should be celebrated. And that we can't just say, your race does not matter because matter, we're experiencing discrimination because of the color of our skin. We are being exploited because the color of our skin and people are getting away with it because of the color of our skin. So we have to change. What can you do to really address what's been happening and how we move forward. I think one, we have to have an understanding of what this looks like. We have to have an understanding again in the past. The information I just share with us stuff that we don't get taught in school. Black history isn't taught in school. So you have to have an understanding of why black people are where they are today and why we do what we do and why we're doing well. As far as justices concerns. With that word, that knowledge is important when you hold people accountable. So you've seen a lot in the kind of media lately that a lot of companies like businesses and visuals phase like that next that Black Lives Matter. They, they put up little signs is that black lives matter. And they're saying that they're going to stand with the black community moving forward and find that we get justice. And so what can we really important moving forward is making sure that we're holding people accountable. Making sure that it goes beyond just saying black lives matter, but what are you gonna do to actually take action? To ensure that we are safe, to ensure that we're protected, to ensure that we get the rights that we need. So and accountability is an incredible thing that we, that we really have to take to heart, especially as we move for the next couple months and onward through the future. Why does it matter that we have accountability? Why does it matter that we have these conversations? Number one, because it's education, we have to have these conversations were better educated. I and all of it really pass impressment and feature. Also. I, and I know that a lot of other individuals want to ensure that people of color and the white community have access to justice, have access to resources. So it starts with these conversations. It starts with identifying what barriers there are four people within the black community to rise to where they need to be. And we have to be having those conversations and we have to ensure that those pathways are available. Because like I showed beginning of this, I am a survivor of sexual violence and I found out very quickly that the services I needed and truly needed to get on the pathway healing were not available to me. And so we really have to take a stand and make sure that that's accessible for everybody. Also, for me, it truly means this is what this is what it truly means to be trauma-informed survivor Center, to be an ally. You can't just step up and say black lives matter without having any context as to why we are saying those for that phrase right now. So make sure that we hold each other accountable. What I always say is that I would encourage people to start with a self-assessment. Find out where you are, find out where your biases lie, and then obey and, and true conversation with your community, with your organizations, with, with companies and businesses, brain that conversation to them. Usual privilege to have those conversations and enter doorways that we may not feel comfortable or be invited to enter. That's the privilege that you do have. That colorblindness says you jump. So use and the best way you can. As far as moving forward, there are a couple of resources I say would be great for you to have. Number one, I think having Kimberly Crenshaw as a part of conversation and a part of your education toolkit. It's critical, she's really the queen of intersectionality. And, you know, again, I think it's important to understand where do these, where do you things like race and poverty and of sites where do things like race and gender and their sides. And what do we have to do as a community to better build an inbuilt safety within our community. Additionally, I think it's always important to reach out to your local black lead organizations. Find out what's going on and find out what they're doing on the ground and what they're finding important to support communities that can be critical. And if anyone ever has questions or wants to discuss, looked me more about building culturally competent programming or having hard conversations. In your community, I'm happy to be there and be a resource. Again, my name is Morgan waiting. I'm happy to share with with us that they would buy my contact information. I'm say you walk in habit and if you feel comfortable and want to reach out smoothly, so free, any questions that you might have, any further conversation you might want to have because this is a short I'm happy to do that, so thank you all again. Greetings. My name as Rashad up direct mad. And I'm the founder and CEO of the Racial Healing Project. I started the Racial Healing Project in response to the reality that no matter what sector you work in, there are vast racial injustices and vast racial inequities that produce harmful racial outcomes. And that's true in education. That's true in government, nonprofit, philanthropy, business. That there are deep-seated racial inequities that are being perpetuated over time, often at the organizational level, but certainly within a broader societal context. Now, that's the bad news. But the good news is that there are things that we can do to address those inequities, to create more racial equity in our organizations in by virtue in our society. And so the Racial Healing Project does work that is focused on helping organizations to identify and to eliminate racial inequities in their daily work. This includes certainly training around anti racism and around how to create an organization that produces a racially equitable outcomes. This is about strategic planning, this is about organizational change management and change processes. We provide technical assistance and consulting as well in doing this work. And part of the work that we do as we think about integrating an, implementing anti-racism frameworks is defining and having some shared definitions is shared understanding about what anti racism is. And it's probably helpful to talk about what anti racism is not. Anti-racism is not neutrality, is not being passive when issues of racial injustice arise. It's not being unclear or using language that does not help to define the problem. Anti-racism is about being active and being very intentional in and doing the harmful outcomes that are associated with structures that are perpetuating inequities. And so it's about making plans, it's about taking actions. It's about setting goals and increasingly accountability to ensure that racial equity is the outcome. And not simply a thing that we are talking about, are simply a thing that we might be aspiring to without any metrics or without any path forward. And so this is a bit of a paradigm shift. Oftentimes folks may position themselves or their organizations as being not racist. That's really has been the goal to make sure that we are not viewed as being racist, or at least being racist in some of these very obvious ways. And so this shift requires us to ask much deeper, much harder questions. How are we assessing the way in which we're producing racially equitable outcomes? What kind of data are we assessing and analyzing? What kind of goals do we have set? Not only for our customers or our consumers, but for ourselves? Anti-racism requires that level of intentionality, that level of action. So that's very clear how the organization is moving forward. There should not be confusion on any of those pieces. This varies a little bit from traditional diversity, equity and inclusion models. And certainly those models are good and there is a significant amount of value in the ideas, diversity, equity and inclusion. However, and anti racism approach requires us to have a deeper analysis of the contexts that are organizations exist within, as well as the ways that race and racism has influenced and shaped the ways we think has shaped our policies and has created interrelated structures that are also contributing to these deep and in often cases, intractable outcomes and realities. So without question, there are more organizations and more groups having conversations about racial equity or about anti-racism. We see that this is taking shape at a national and international level. Many people are reading more books and articles about what it means to be an anti-racist or how do we create spaces that are anti races? And it's important that we're aware and responsive to the current climate that we are in now as we respond to the murders of Briana Taylor and George Floyd and Ahmad Arbery among so many others. The reality that this is creating a very powerful, a very visible, and a very unique way in which we feel accountable to creating equity or racial equity in spaces that we haven't before. And so it's good that that folks are coming to the table and having conversations that perhaps we weren't having even six months ago. And you can align that with the reality of Copan 19 and that this virus is attack and communities in ways that are disproportionate am and creating disparate outcomes for black communities, Latino communities, and us. Use of color. And so there are these contemporary, current challenges that are really highlighting and elevating the importance of a racial equity lens. And positioning yourself so that you can work in a way that is producing racial equity. But it's important to remember that these current issues are also couch in a much broader context. And whether that's an analysis of 16-19 when the first Africans were brought to this continent as slaves. Or even the ways in which the indigenous peoples of this land were hunted and exterminated. And even as we think through history, moving from 1619 to the late 16 nineties, as laws became more formalized in this country that focused on the separation of those of African descent from those of European descent and so on and so forth. There are many other ways in which this historic context has really shaped our contemporary challenges. But it's important that we don't lose sight of the fact that this has been a very long Challenge. This has been a very long reality for black people and for people of color in this country. And so we want justice for Briana. We want justice for our motto when Justice for George want justice for all of those individuals. And we also need to be thinking about how we deconstruct these very long standing structures and systems that create daily and an acute and continuous indignities and continuous injustices in so many other spaces and in so many other ways that we can measure when we look at racial inequities in the system. And so that really pushes me to advocate for us to continue to have these conversations. Make sure that we're creating spaces in our personal and professional lives or we can learn and grow and continue to increase our own ability to understand some of what's happening currently in some of what has been happening historically. But it also means that we have to move ambitiously and move courageously towards actions. It's good that we're learning is good that we're growing. But we can't stay here. We have to take actions. Remember, being anti-racist means that we're taking actions. And so we have to take actions to move us forward. And what do we understand about the way we are currently functioning? What kind of questions are we asking? What kind of data are we collecting and are we looking at that data disaggregated by race? If we're thinking about action steps, what kind of goals do our organizations need to set? So that we are ensuring that we have a lens for racial equity and that we have metrics for racial equity. If we're setting goals for racial equity in and to make sure that our organizations are becoming anti-racist. Then what kind of accountability or we also putting in place to make sure that it's not just talk. But that if we're setting goals that were also assessing whether we're making progress towards those goals. And if there are obstacles to those goals, that we are identifying those obstacles and that we are working to remove barriers and to remove challenges so that we can continue to move forward. There has been a lot of conversation and a lot of different places around what we can do and what we should do to achieve racial equity not only as an organization or as individuals, but also as a society. And part of that means that we have to be shifting ambitiously from dialogue, from conversation and learning toward actions towards clear action steps that we can all be taking. And holder held each other accountable to. So oftentimes, this is the beginning. The fact that we're having a dialogue and the fact that we're increasing our shared understanding and that's important to do. And so I encourage you all to continue to move forward and be bold, be brave, make the right investments, think outside the box. And make sure that as this work is happening, that we recognize that anti-racism is everybody's work. It is not simply the work of black people and brown people and people of color. This is everybody's work because white folks work. And we all need to be stepping up and making decisions that we know will set us up for a future where our race, where our skin color won't be the determination of our life outcomes. Thank you. Hi. My name is Dr. Shane and Cambrian and I serve as the chair of the School of Social Work at Spaulding University in mobile, Kentucky. It's my privilege to spend the next few minutes with you unpacking in discussing the differences between the terms anti-racist and non racist. But before we get to that distinction, I'd like to add one more element to our continuum, and that would be racist. But before we can even explore that dimension, I think it's important for us to have at least a snapshot shared definition of what racism is. So racism, in a very brief definition, is simply the bias and oppression of one group by another based on perception of race and ethnicity. I think it's important that we are intentional about the use of perception. Because we know that race is a social construct, not a biological construct. There is no white gene. There is no black gene. In fact, there are more differences between like groups. Then between different groups. The construct of race was developed. To ensure that we had markers that offered those spaces of privilege for individuals classified as white. Now, we go back and again, I know I'm giving you a precursor or with history lesson, but forgive me, it's the academic and me. But that was the first classification of the use of the term white actually doesn't show up in history until we look at Virginia in our colonial days, somewhere around 16801690, for the first time it shows up in Virginia Law. And it shows up with purpose and intent to differentiate between those individuals who were either serving as indentured servants at that point, the beginning of the slave trade. And, or those individuals who owned land and then in turned owned these individuals. So when we start to unpack the idea of a racism and racist behavior, it's important to understand that these constructs were not biological in origin and that they were crafted in design with a purpose. So if we understand that racism is the exercise of oppressive behavior toward one group by another based solely on the perception of race. Then we know that racist practices, our practices that are grounded in that notion of superiority of one race over another. But we also know that, that grounded perception of superiority is based in no element of science or effect. It is a constructed narrative designed to endorse and ensure the sublimation of one group by another. We know that this follows a historic continuum that these notions that were talking with so boldly today in, in far more circles than, than I've ever seen as both an academic, a social worker in an anti-racist. These conversations are bubbling in places that I've never seen before. And but we know even though there is a current in the contemporary edge to them, we cannot let go of the historic contract context and the thread that pulls through to each of these contemporary and modern day conversations. So if we define on one end that a racist is an individual who purposely and willfully embrace his practices and policies of oppression by one group over another. That's this into the continuum. Then we have felt for years that the opposite end of the continuum would simply be that I'm, I'm, I'm not racist. I'm a non racist. You may have heard individuals self-defined for years, in fact, become defensive and conversations and dialogue and say, but that's not me, I'm not racist. Many of you have made, maybe heard of folks share the term. That doesn't fit me. I'm colorblind. Colorblind is not a reality. When it comes to the embracing of humanity, the embracing of the people that we get to share this journey with, to claim to be colorblind is to actually refuse to see the uniqueness and the brilliance of difference. For folks to claim I am not races. Now there may be truth that goes with that. A definition that is currently used and embraced by many leading scholars and authors, including candy and coats. A, a non racist is an individual who at their cord genuinely believes that there is not a difference of better or less. Based on perception of race or identification with race. A non racist is someone who genuinely believes in the equity in the equality of individual, the equity and equality of worth, of capability, of capacity. And you're probably saying to yourself right now. So why is that a problem? How is that a bad thing to be a non racist? It's not bad. It's limiting. And it only gets us a part of the way there. Because if we recognize and acknowledge that for generations, we had built the economy, built the capital of this nation literally on the backs of enslaved peoples. And that by the establishment of the passage of the Voting Rights Acts build the civil rights amendment. That if our theory is that by simply that passage, that we have done our due diligence and we have ended the impact and we had ended systemic and institutional racism. It inherently dismisses those multiple generations of inequity, of abuse and horror. And we've said instead, well now we expect you to be able to run the full race with everyone else you instead because of the oppression applied to these groups of individuals. Again, simply because of perception of race. That those of us who have benefited from structures that favored white skin. Those of us who have had I've marked opportunities that weren't earned, but we're inherently made available simply because of our whiteness. If we simply leave it at that unknown racist, I believe in the full capacity and inherent worth of all, regardless of skin color, regardless of gender, regardless of orientation, regardless of any defining element. If we only stop there, then where in essence, setting back and conceding that the structures of institutional and systemic racism will prevail. Because if these systems are to be brought down in, these systems are to be dismantled. That has to be dismantled by those who actually built them. The work of doing systems of white supremacy does not fall on those that white supremacy has oppressed. The work of undoing white supremacy falls to those who have benefited from this white narrative. Which takes me to the space of identifying and defining a little bit more about what it is to actually be anti racist. To be anti racist, I believe you have to be, at your core, a non racist. You have to believe in the full capacity and inherent worth of all, regardless of any markers that we might attribute to effects, especially markers that we attribute along the lines of race. But to be anti-racist, acknowledges that the simple awareness and it kind of imbuing of inherent worth is not enough. An anti-racist picks up and takes on the challenge of dismantling the systems that have created the very privilege that we walk in. To be an anti-racist requires us to acknowledge that there are systems that we have benefited from, that we did nothing to earn, but are simply granted to us by the very color of our skin. And anti-racist then takes up those systems and takes issue with those systems in finds ways to begin the process of the dismantlement of those systems. Now, that does not mean that to be an effective anti-racist, You have to have multiple degrees and you have to have access an inroads to all of these spaces where you can enter and make the most impact for destroying these systems. In fact, you can show up is a very bold anti-racist in social media. You can show up as a bold and assertive anti-racist in the checkout line at the grocery store. Now it's a little bit harder right now because we're all supposed to have on masks and it's harder to necessarily interject yourself into conversation. But it can still be done. Because the work of an anti-racist is someone who chooses to interrupt the evidence of racism whenever it presents itself. That means maybe you're at a family gathering. Someone makes an offhand joke. People around, you were laughing and chuckling. And even you can tell that there are some folks who are a little uncomfortable about it. But the normative would be in your family to simply let it go. The anti-racist says we can never let it go. Just as those individuals who live in the skin of Being Black, Live in the skin of being Brown, can never let go of the, of the beauty that is being black, the beauty that is being black, and the burden that it is to be black and brown in this nation. The, the fear, the anxiety that comes with being black and brown in this nation, simply because you are black or brown, are our brothers and sisters can't ever let that go. That calls us to action to say we can't ever let a statement go. A misinformed assertion of fact in conversation. Maybe, again, going back to the, the illustration of maybe an off-handed joke that makes you uncomfortable and you could tell it makes maybe a few folks in the room uncomfortable, but the norm would be in your circle or in that family experience to just let it go change the subject and move on. The anti-racist would call it out, would say, hey, here's why that's a problem. Here's my unmade uncomfortable about that and here's why whether you mean to or not, that by sharing that kind of story, offering, that kind of joke, you're contributing to the perpetuation of racism and anti-racist. When sitting at a staff meeting, sending in a faculty meeting, and they encounter a statement that is even just subliminal way. Racist, maybe provides part of a fact, but not the whole fact. So the story becomes skewed. And anti-racist speaks up. And anti-racist says, wait a minute, I'm not sure that that's exactly the narrative. When looking at policies, procedures, protocols in an organization than an anti-racist has been able to move into, in, and maybe even have voice or shared responsibility in an anti-racist looks for ways to unpack policies, protocols, procedures that had been purposely crafted with this racist notion of privileged for some the meaning of others. And calls those practices, policies, protocols, procedures into question, and challenges the organization to dismantle them and rebuild them through a lens of equity. An anti-racist May March in the streets with folks who for over 70 days demand justice for the murder of Briana Taylor in global Kentucky. And anti-racist may send supplies to those who march and other cities, as they call out for justice in the deaths of George Floyd, Amman Arbery. An anti-racist, can show up in, provide support in voice and strength to a movement for equity in so many areas. But I know that oftentimes the call to move from being non races to anti-racist can be intimidating. Let's be honest, the effects who struggle with conversations about racism or wife apps. And in case you haven't been able to tell by your screen yet. I'm a white folk. I'm a white, middle aged woman, even though my children regularly tell me that by claiming to be middle aged, I'm planning on living well over a 100 now. I believe it's my choice to live over a 100. So I'm going to claim the middle age. Whether that is real or not, the reality definitely is that I'm a white woman. And as such, I work, I operate, I walk, I breathe in a certain level of privilege. I can choose to be non racist because I do believe at my core IN non racist, my belief structure, my personal faith walk calls me to that space of inherent worth of all. Calls me to that space of seeing the equity and capacity all individuals. It also calls me to see the inequity an opportunity that is paired with that equity in capacity. So I had my core, I'm definitely non racist. I choose to be anti racist. I choose to show up in spaces and use my voice to use the privilege that I have to call out the microaggressions that I see. Then I here to call into questions, practices, procedures, policies to march alongside those individuals who were calling for justice. But in order for me to effectively do that, I think a critical caveat in a critical component to being an effective anti-racist, to being an effective accomplice in the work of justice is we have to be prepared and we have to do our homework. For me. A competent, equipped, capable Anti-racist is an individual who commits themselves to learning all of the pieces of American history that have been sanitized and omitted from our educational opportunities leading to today. That means I have to commit my time and my energy into a deeper level of understanding of this context of racism in this nation. The reality of it is we have huge portions of our American history that are literally and purposely left out of public education. Now, if I had the time, I would explore with you that, that process that the Daughters of the Confederacy, confederacy so effectively engaged in and making sure that when we talked about slavery, when we talked about that, that 400 year staying on our resistance, that we relegated to. Just a paragraph when we talked about the civil war. That was purposed. Because what we do not know of, we cannot speak to me. Say that again. What we do not know of, we cannot authentically, accurately and powerfully speak to. So if our call is to be anti-racist, to be active in dismantling the systems of racism. We've got some homework to do. We've got some things to learn. But good news is there are so many people out there ready to help on that journey. There are so many fabulous texts, fabulous books that had been written, so that we get that additional story. We bring that voice in. It is different than ours and we can learn our history, because once we know our history, we can dismantle it for our future. So in order to effectively be an anti-racist, We have some homework to do. Number two, we have to commit ourselves to a constant space of self-reflection. There is not a badge that we will earn that says Today you have reached the status of anti-racist. And you can put that badge on and you walk in the world in that space of being an anti-racist. To be an anti-racist, you have to pick up the mantle every single day because we have to commit to at the end of the day, reflecting what did I do well today, where did I get uncomfortable? Why did my tongue get tied in that situation? Because it will no matter how long you do it, and no matter how long you commit yourself to the work, you will hit spaces where suddenly you feel uncomfortable, ill informed. Do I know what to say? But a commitment to anti-racist practice says we will still show up, will own our mistakes when we make them, we will seek out wise counsel. We will reflect on ways that we can approach situations differently. How can we show up more effectively? And then we get up the next day and we start again. Finally, a commitment to anti-racist practice calls us to building bridges and coalitions. If individuals whose stories are different than ours, that means sometimes one of the most effective thing that an anti-racist practitioner, an anti-racist can do is simply listen. We have to be cognizant of the fact that the white voice is privileged in the US. We're used to hearing our stories, were used to then taking charge and creating solutions and providing options. What we're not geared to is listening to different narratives, which then puts us at risk for buying into the myth of a single story. So an anti-racist must commit themselves to listening to the lived experiences of racism by individuals who look different, Who's lion lived experience has been different. If we commit ourselves to those three practices, then we can fully embrace this idea of being an anti-racist. And it won't become a checkbox. And it won't become a batch that we wear. And something that we can say that we've done. But it becomes a way of being for us. The good news is I genuinely believe that the more we create and cultivate a vast group of anti racists. The more we will be able to dismantle the systems that have kept us divided, that have perpetuated inequity. I like to say, it's kinda good to try to blow things up. We want to blow up the systems that perpetuate inequity, that perpetuate division, that perpetuate oppression. And John Lewis is terms we want to be about the business of being in good trouble. And I genuinely believe that if we commit ourselves be onto the tier of non racist to embracing the call of action, to being an anti-racist. Then not only will we get into some good trouble, it will sustain some good tuned. Hello, I'm Leslie Benzer, a singer in social science major here at Indiana University Southeast. I will be sharing my experiences with the events that have occurred during this past year with Coburn 19, it was ironic to think that at the Multicultural Student Union holiday party, I showed a video from the Netflix series explained about the next pandemic. The information presented in the video is eerily similar to what was going to unfold over the next few months with Coburn 19 is shine the light image and highly romanticized people quarantining and the safety of their own homes. I didn't realize how much of a privilege I had to have access to a stable and reliable internet connection or my house. I saw comics of how people in lower socioeconomic statuses didn't have the luxury to stay at home. With family in partaken new hobbies and activities such as the middle and upper classes did I think is essential to understand and not to hide how many people struggled is great for those who learned how to create and bake bread from scratch. Still, we should appreciate those essential workers who often aren't recognized, such as fast food employees, like public transportation drivers, sanitation workers, and much more. Unfortunately, some of these people make minimum wage or struggle more than others to meet ends meet. We should always be thankful for their services that they provide. We should also try our best to keep not only ourselves safe but others as well. You might not get sake that you may be a carrier and pass it to someone else who was more at risk. I will now talk about the Black Lives Matter, movement. To all the black lives lost, Emilia, rest, empower someone who doesn't have social media. My experience of the BA, ETL and move, right? It looks a little bit different. I got most of my information from the news and my friends. I assign all the petitions and watch YouTube videos where the ad revenue would get donated to different organizations. A hit close to home with Briana Taylor's death. As everything was unfolding right across the river. It's terrible to think that a high number of black people experience the injustice that Briana Taylor suffered. One of the most important messages from the movement is that being not races is not enough. We must all be anti-racist and help them them as allies. We need to check our privileges and actively listen, engage. We could self teach ourselves about different topics on how to be an ally and other important topics. Inthe LatinX community, there's a lot of issues surrounding anti blackness and colorism. Having these discussions with family and friends who don't understand is a one way towards the right direction to a more understanding community. And at times it can be hard and frustrating. But as an ally to the black community, it's important to show solidarity in commitment to the movement. We should remember it's not about joining the moment, but inside of joining the movement. As a young Latino woman, The Death of Vanessa again, also made us a significant impact. It's crazy to think that in a country that claims to love those who serve and protect their often victims that suffer at the hands of their own institution. It hurts to know that Hispanic woman was killed and her base wasn't trying to properly investigate it. It also pains me to to know that it took until gains investigation to find the missing body of private Gregory would tell morale is it shows how some of the most respected institutions can be flawed and corrupted. It also represents how important it is to buy even when it seems that the odds are stacked against you. With the cases of Briana Taylor. And then as again, we see you out there, cases weren't getting the attention that they deserved. Yet. The voices of their families and the support of others, their communities, and social media platforms demonstrated how recognition and movements can be made. In conclusion, I encourage everyone to strive to be a good human being, to realize the privileges we may have, and to use our privileges to help others is on everyone during this pandemic to keep each other safe and healthy by doing your part.

Description of the video:Welcome to the 2020 Mental Health and Wellness seminar series on the COVID-19 pandemic. I'm Amanda Stonecipher, Vice Chancellor for Enrollment Management and Student Affairs. The goal of the Mental Health and Wellness seminar series is to provide information on current topics related to mental health. With the goal of decreasing the stigma of mental health and increasing understanding and self-care. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all of us. This series brings together experts from the field of nursing, education, and psychology to address a variety of topics, from how to get comfortable wearing a mask and public to the reality of the illness caused by the virus and ways to manage working from home with young children. This topic is timely as we all navigate the challenges brought forth by the pandemic. Thank you to the speakers for sharing their expertise on this important topic and for the organizers, for their time and energy they dedicated to this series. I hope you enjoy all of the presentations, learned something new, and find new ways to stay healthy and well. And remember mask up. Hello, I am Dr. Rice. I teach at Slippery Rock University. I received my PhD from University Kentucky and my bachelors of science from Indiana University. However, I'm not here to talk to you about that. I'm here to talk to you about preexisting conditions and COVID-19. My daughter is a healthy and happy 11-year-old. However, that was not always the case. This is a picture of her at Kosair Children's Hospital when we were receiving one of many, many treatments for her immune compromised condition, she had what's called idiopathic benign nature Kenya, which met for a long time about the first five to six years life, she was unable to fight off any type of bacterial infections that included things like the cold, pneumonia, the flu, which is viral. Pretty much any type of illness that you think about that goes around. We spent a lot of time in clean rooms and hospitals. She was a St. Jude baby. She had a special doctor who said she saw weekly. But bacterial infections, especially respiratory infections, could be fatal for her at that time. At 1, her score was so low that we did resort to mass squaring. So this is her trying on her birthday. You can tell she's not happy and mountains where a whole family ended up having to wear a mask in order for her to wear it. Massa became a modelling experience where she saw us doing it, so she would do it too, but it was it was hard to get her to wear a mask into where it appropriately and not touch it. But it was necessary at the time, we used to make jokes that she was the last Michael Jackson fan, which ironically she is a Michael Jackson band, but for a while she'd wear mask them. We weren't gloves. When when holding her. During all this time, I was actually a student at us. I worked full-time. I was taking classes at night or on my days off. I had to go in and be around people, sit in a classroom with 50-60 other students. When I got home, I changed my clothes and I hoped and prayed it and bring anything. Whoa, I'm sure sometimes I am the reason why we ended up in in a clean room. Sometimes that ended up with surgeries. She would get a scratch and we'd get infected. She couldn't fight it. They would have to cut out the infection. Every to every cold needed medication that had to go through these IDEs that she hated cause it was so thick and syrupy had to be given slowly. It was a long and painful five years. And so my daughter, like I said, is doing absolutely fabulous now, however, obvious for obvious reasons, when I think about Kevin 19, I think about what it would have been like to navigate with her condition. And I have a colleague who has a daughter now who does have an active case of immune compromise and choose immune compromised. So when I see people with these comments and they say things like, the immune-compromised should be the ones to quarantine and wear a mask. I think about our children, and especially Abbey, and the fact that I could not do that in order to maintain her health insurance, in order to maintain a whole house ever roof over had I had to continue to go to work. I had to continue to go to school to get a better job, to get great insurance so she could see the best doctors. So I had to go out in the world and navigate with people who might be working sec but worked. What was working well for me at that time though, was that the things that could really make her sec like pneumonia. When people get that, they go home, they feel bad, they get a fever, very little incubation period where they don't know they're sick. So they don't come to work with things like pneumonia in and it's not as catchy. If I'm working with someone who, who does so it's less likely that I'm going to take that home. However, with COVID-19. And what we're learning is that's not true, is that you and I may never know we even have habits. Thankfully, the majority of us may get cope at 19 and I'm not even have symptoms or being in the Midwest, we I might think that their allergies and overlook that. However, that in itself is really scary because that means you are going to come to work. You are going to come and sit in a classroom with a teacher like me. And then it is very catchy, that's what we're learning. I may take it home to someone like my daughter. And that's that's where we're at right now, is trying to keep that away from the immune compromised. Which means we're going to have to wear a mask, right? That's the only defense we have right now, is we're learning that the virus is transmitted through or spit. And when we talk or we laugh, Are we get excited? Or we sit in a closed classroom with poor ventilation. And we get that spit in the air. It can be transmitted easily. And we may transmit something that could potentially be deadly to someone. High risk profile. And so for that reason, I'll be wearing my mask for you. And I ask that you wear your mask for me. Hello everyone. I hope this video finds everyone well and safe and happy. Wanted to kinda talk about my experiences during the coded pandemic. This parent, Kobe pandemic. I again, my name is and I'm a professor here at the School of Nursing. And I've been here since 2018. A little bit about myself. I finished my PhD actually this month, August 20-20. And I'm happy to be here. Basically, I wanted to go over what my background is as a nurse and also my background, my educational preparation. So I have ten years of experience at the University of Google Hospital and the surgical intensive care unit. It's a trauma unit. And I have a PhD that have started in 2014 and finished this year. So the research is on moral distress. And I interviewed nurses and asked about how they feel about the care that they provide when perhaps it is unethical or immoral. How do they deal with it? How do they address it? Doesn't stress them out and how they cope with it. And I think it's important to know that context about me a little bit. And why I decided to go back to school, which was to improve clinical care include improved clinical practice. And when the pandemic happened in March and then transition into April with the shut down. A lot of people were upset. A lot of people are scared, a lot of people were worried. And I think it's important to prepare ourselves with knowledge about all of this and with a routine. At least that's helped me get through this point. So a little bit about my routine at work. So I still worked part-time at the hospital. And what I've found is the same demeanor or the way I conduct myself at the hospital applies here at school. So what I mean by that is situational awareness. You know, when as a nurse and you don a pair of gloves and you're in a patient room. And there's almost a certain self-awareness about, well, if I've touched something and it's dirty that I don't want to touch other things that are potentially dirty. Well, this this applies to write the air like breathing air and and preventing exposures to other people. Perhaps if you work at a facility myself, I know that transmission could be possible. Maybe I can be asymptomatic, but a little bit about the routine. So when I park at work and get out of the car, I automatically put my mask on. I have a mask and put it on my car before I get out of the vehicle. Just to maintain that situational awareness about being a good steward of my space. Very conscientious about exposing and not exposing myself for other people to potential risk. And that's why I just important just dawned the mass before you get out of your car. And then when I walk into the facility, automatically don't want a unit where I work after I've clocked in and I screen my temperature. And by taking your temperature and kind of self-assessing, do I feel Malays? Do I feel bad? I do feel off in some way. And if I'm also running a temperature that I'm not going to go to work, right. I'm an important report that immediately that hasn't fortunately happened. But I can say it's good to follow this step, to follow this routine, to develop a routine about self-awareness about, about one's impact in the environment and in the space around them. So at work, it's definitely wearing a mask at all times. And if I'm not wearing a mask, then I'm probably taking a drink of water or I'm eating and that I mean, that that has to occur in the hospital, you know, we have to eat. So what I do is I try to make it a point to do so in the break room or away from patients. Mainly because it's a reciprocal relationship, right? I don't want to expose them, and I don't want to be exposed to them unnecessarily. So that's why the mask is important. And in the hospital setting, it is difficult to maintain social distancing, right? When you're carrying for someone who said particularly in the ICU. And what I mean by that is what the trauma ICU, we actually screen our patients fur Cove it. And so there's a sign on the door. And you have to put this sign on the door so it's a green for their they're not positive for Cove. It, it's red if they're positive. Right. And it's yellow if the test has been sent. So it is a swamp that goes into the nose and it usually takes about four hours to get back. So if you would think if a patient sustained a car wreck and then they came they presented to the emergency room and maybe that's when they got swapped. And then they were sent to the ICU for care. That may happen before the test comes back. So that's why it's important in those types of patients who the test has not known, the results aren't known yet to still maintain proper PPE or personal protective equipment. And that can't be understated enough is is to be very cognizant of handwashing in-between patient rooms and between patient contacts. Anytime I go in a room alcohol, my hands hand sanitizer. And anytime I come out of Earth alcohol my hands with hand sanitizer. And this is while also dawning gloves, don't having my mask on at all times. So I think one of the biggest takeaways here is fight the fear, fight the anxiety and stress that come along with all of these experiences. And just be good stewards, arm ourselves with knowledge to be the best practitioners as possible at home. So when I come home from work, I do try to be cognizant of the clothes that I'm wearing, scrubs that I'm wearing, even the shoes that I'm wondering. So what I'll do is I'll take my shoes and scrubs off for a walk in the house. So they're automatically threw them in the Washington in the laundry. And then I will clean my shoes with alcohol. Hawaii. It's not to be so concerned with germs that border, borders on paranoia, right? But in working in a hospital and working in a facility where patients who could potentially have Cove it r is a good idea and has a proven idea to maintain that self-awareness. So I think when you come home, it's not a good idea at aware. Go to sleep and disrupts the aorta work or where your shoes in track around your house and the shoes the world work. It would be good to maybe put them in a separate bag at or just be mindful that not like these are my workflows and these are my work shoes. So I try to be cognizant of that as well. Coming to school also presents its own set of unique challenges in working at us. And as we start this fall semester, I know anxiety may be high with a lot of people because they may fear exposure. They may fear contracting Cove it. But all we can do is our best. And one of those things is here again, the theme is practiced self-awareness. Always having a mask on whether it be going to the bathroom, whether it be in an off even if you're in your office and the door is open or if you're in a classroom setting. I know that I'm going to be having a class in stem concert hall at the center, a communications course and also critical care. And the goal. But that will be no food or drink being very cognisant of our self-awareness. They are no food or drink in that space. And also the introns and exit are different. So we don't have increased traffic in that regard. And at the end of class, I will gather my students to clean high traffic areas, will have spray bottles and hand sanitizer to clean up the arm rests and also to alcohol hands before for coming in once they leave. So it's just being mindful and reminding ourselves that take the time to be safe. And the only way we can do that is by slowing down and thinking about our actions being intentional and deliberate. And I think that's the greatest advice that I that I may offer. Because this is a trying time right now as we're dealing with the pandemic. And one of the best things we can do is where we go to the grocery store or whether we go or rather where rather when we're on our way home, wherever we're worried, amass, right? It's just it's proven practice. And I think whether we're feeling if we feel any type of change in our state of health. If we're more tired than usual, if we're running a low-grade fever. If this is this is the point where we need to seek treatment, right? We need to seek help. And even if it turns out to be benign or, you know, it's not code that you go to get tested. I think it is important to twist nearby. And now more than ever, because the unique set of challenges that we face right now is that we all have to do our part. And if we're all doing our part collectively, than safety can be insured, or at least we can try to ensure the safety of everyone. So this fall. I asked people to say, stay self-aware. Be mindful, space, be mindful of social distancing six feet or more from peers, colleagues, staff. When by maintaining this social distance and also wearing a mask, we protect ourselves and those around us. But also, I think it is important in this time to take time for yourself. And two is very easy to look at the news, to look at statistics and data. And he worried and to be scared. But you can control the amount of information that comes in about negative things. And I encourage everyone to do take time to have those moments that relaxation or stress relief, whether at the exercise, going for a walk. That's going to be important because that will help maintain mental health and that will help maintain perspective throughout this ongoing pandemic, you know? And I think that's the best thing we can do for ourselves is take care of ourselves in addition to being self-aware about our actions. So again, my name is Ana booth here at the School of Nursing. And I'm excited to be coming back this. All. I know that it's going to be challenging, but I'm looking forward to seeing everyone's face via Zoom. And for the two classes that I do have instant Concert Hall, I look forward to those as well, but I caution everyone to just maintain perspective, maintain that sense of space, and always wear a mask. And we will, we will be able to get through this. I don't this is not going to be forever if we do our part and if we maintain safe practice. Thank you. For them. I'm Dr. Logan Khan from the psychology and neuroscience programs at IU Southeast. And I'm also a mother of a four-year-old daughter and an AMA seven-year-old son. I'm going to talk here about some strategies to manage your and your family's mental well-being during the pandemic while parenting? So here was a situation that my family ran into from mid-March until early August. Myself, my spouse or to kids and our elderly dog. We're all working, learning, and living in our home 24 hours a day. Up until that point, both of our children had attended school or child care full-time sense. About four months of age. My spouse and I worked full-time outside of our home. My approach to this complete change and all of our life plans was to try and take the best of what school and daycare offered our kids and create some of that at home. So first of all, school gives predictability. One of the most stressful things about the pandemic and all these changes has been that many aspects of life have become unpredictable. We can create some predictability for ourselves and our children by making a realistic schedule. As the situation with the pandemic and openings has changed, we make a new schedule. In March when we were all home together. We had one schedule, a modified one, once my son finished virtual kindergarten and had some more unscheduled free time. And now we have another schedule since my daughter and spouse are regularly leaving the house for work in daycare. I don't try to schedule everything, but we do have scheduled wake up in bed times, mealtimes, works less school time, and exercise. Sam. And I just do it on a little piece of scrap paper that my son looks over with me so he can give me some feedback about what he does and doesn't like about the schedule. Another important thing that kids get from school is social interaction. School provides this interaction with peers as well as adults. At some points in this time, when we felt it was safe, our kids have visited outdoors with Playmates and neighbors. At times when we were more concerned about are possible covert 19 exposure, lake 1A, first kids were first tome from school or after I had some emergency dental work. We've kept her social interaction virtual or within just our home. Oliver family live out-of-state. So sometimes grandma has read books over Google Hangouts. And we even had a virtual birthday party for our daughter when she opened presence and blow candles in front of a webcam. I also make sure to schedule in some time with my kids each day. Definitely when they first wake up in the morning. Usually reading time then at most meals, and then at the end of the workday to play or to go outside for a walk. Especially with my son. He's alright. Playing by himself. When I have a meeting, if he knows that his time with me is guaranteed to come in a couple of hours. Obviously, learning is another big thing that happens at school in daycare. And we found some ways to weave learning into our at home lives for their kids. My kids seem to eat all the time. So they've become more involved in some of our food preparation and we take opportunities there for learning. My son can practice reading by listing ingredients from recipes. And my daughter can count how many cups of ingredients were adding. We've done other things like we watched the SpaceX launch together and then read about and created cutouts of the planets in our solar system. But don't get me wrong. We don't do Pinterest crafts everyday. Usually one or two times a month, we can do something more involved than just coloring. Physical activity is another area that kids get a lot of benefit from outside activities. And I know one major concern the experts have mentioned is kids not getting enough exercise. Wilhelm, my spouse and I are both from northern areas. I'm from upstate New York. So I was bundling my kids up and taking them outside to play when it was winter. Even though playgrounds around our home have remained closed during the pandemic. After bit of complaining are kids have discovered the Zhou Wei of wading into streams and rain boots and making mud pies. On days when the weather has been too bad for even me. We've been doing YouTube based workouts through go noodle, kids bop, or get kids moving. So R afterwards. But I found that some movement even makes me feel a lot better emotionally. We've also got to do some things that we felt that school was not doing very well. Mainly too much time sitting indoors. On days when the weather's nice. We've had lunch on a blanket in the backyard or at a park, socially distance from other people. We brought a no book outside to draw and write about birds and bugs and plants. It's not a huge change of scenery, but it does help break up the monotony of quarantine to have a different spot for some activities. Maintaining mental wellness has been hard and we have all had different times of struggle over the months. There are some things that can be done now to move through some moments of anxiety and stress. When I'm feeling really overwhelmed with the kids, my work, or just the world in general. I'd take a five-minute walk or just leaves the room and do some deep breathing by myself. That's definitely helped me avoid escalating emotions when my kids are having a hard time or creating drama in our house. It's also really important to remember realistic expectations for everyone. The rapid changes in life that came from the pandemic are hard for adults to cope and accept. So I didn't expect my kids take all that in without some difficulty. Little kids, like my daughter, can only control a few things. And our lives. So I've learned over the years to expect problems in eating, sleeping, and or potty behavior when she is experiencing some stress. Sensor was mentally prepared for this when she went through stage the summer and she only wanted to E to foods and refused to eat anything else. I had some strategies ready to go. And now she is back to eating other fade. Since I've taken on so much more Daytime care for my children, their meals, and their learning. I have less hours in the day. I've decided that since no one's coming to my house anyway, cleaning is less important. As my spouse and daughter have been leaving the house more. We do disinfect door handles, counters, and sinks multiple times a day. But I let the dog here roam freely much more than I did before because I just don't have the time right now. When I get overwhelmed, I try to remind myself, this is a pandemic like the world has not seen in over 100 years. And I'm doing what I can in the time that most of us were not mentally prepared for. Another good strategy to keep in mind is disconnecting from the electronics. I think every parent to seeing the memes about letting Disney plus manager kids while trying to work remotely. And I think most of us have leaned on electronics or media more than maybe we intended. However, media usage can contribute to negative emotions and poor health. My kids do have screen time each day. We're limited to less than an hour for our daughter and less than three hours of mostly educational computer games or videos for our sun. As the sun moves to virtual school, his recreational screen time will go down so that he's not spending on will they in front of a computer? It's definitely really easy for me to just pick up my smartphone and scroll through renews after the kids go to bed. But I try to avoid that becoming a regular habit. Instead, I go for a walk or do a short yoga series as a transition activity before returning to worker email. Science supports the role of exercise and time in nature as ways to improve mood and detention. As a neuroscience colleague, Dr. Jeffery burgdorferi is to say, people think watching TV makes them happy. But what really makes people happy is going for a walk. Planning ahead. Is another strategy that's become really important to us. When people feel short on time. Upfront time investments often are avoided, but these can be huge time savers in the long run. Some upfront time investments that can be really helpful include weekly or a longer meal planning. Our pandemic grocery strategy has been limited to limit our store trips to once every 14 to 16 days. So we make meal plans into week increments that include leftover nights. And we also frontload our schedule with meals that require the fresh ingredients. While the last seven to ten days rely mostly on pantry and freezer items. And everything on our list has to be something that can be made in 30 or 40 minutes or it's not happening. Taking some time upfront to plan activities for the kids has also helped them feel engaged, which means less boredom and less whining. We've done some things like starting to save. I used plastic lids and paper towel tubes so that we can make trash vehicles. Used egg cartons, and some cardboard or paper ended up being saved. And our kids used to make boats further getting pool or to float in the bathtub. My sons didn't even become involved in this by giving me lists of supplies to keep or to buy when he finds a recipe or craft into Magazine that he wants to try. And this was one of our trash vehicle creations. But we came up with keeping a pope can be hard right now. And we all need something to look forward to. A new social media right now has been full of postings about Halloween or Christmas being canceled this year because of the pandemic. But there are things that can be done safely to celebrate even now. And a little something special can go a long way to making everyone feel more positive. Since we limit daily screen time, we have had a couple of special movie nights when we let our kids stay up late to watch a complete movie, sometimes with popcorn or chocolate. To celebrate the first day of summer. We let the kid stay up late and catch fireflies in the backyard. On one of our first warm days in the spring, we had a picnic lunch outside on a blanket and they got to bring their favorite sleep toys outside with them. So there are some things that make little moments of specialists. I hope you found some of the suggestions here helpful. Even with some really great plans. Some days we just let the kids trashed the house. So my spouse and I can sit, watch a clip on YouTube. Or I spent ten minutes crying over mom memes because this is a pandemic. We're all trying to cope the best weekend. Thank you. Description of the video: I don't know. Maybe I should go ahead and get started without James, do you think? Yes I sent, we sent him the link. And advised him to close out every other Zoom. That's what I had to do, close everything. We have 15 people and I want to be respectful of people's time. And here my screen. If people join us later, that is great. So share my screen and get this down. Get that down. Get this up. Well, thank you everyone for joining us today with our zoom troubles. And I apologize again for those of you who are just joining us, trouble logging in. Both zoom fatigue is real and also all of the frustrations with learning the ever-changing world of technology. And if you're like me, you're probably three or four different platforms throughout a given day to today, we're talking about turning surviving into thriving kind of understanding and managing stress, especially during a pandemic. And hopefully James Volcker center will be joining us from the Department of Equity and Diversity. This was really his idea. And luckily, I'm going to do the first part and he's going to the second part. So hopefully he'll be here by the time that gets started. But he independently thought of this at the same time that I think a lot of other people were worried about the front-line caretakers, our faculty and staff, because you're out there trying to do your best to help our students manage their stress along with being successful students. And we wanted to make sure we did something to kind of look out for you and give you some supports as well. So with that in mind, once you kind of know what to expect for the next hour or so, we're going to do is kind of a little bit of psycho education on the theory of stress management and how to succeed with that. Take notes if you want, because the test is going to be your life. I'm not going to ask you any questions, but we're all trying to manage our stress as best we can. And there may be some helpful tips that you make it along the way. After I do a bit of that for about 25 or 30 minutes, we're going to take a little breathe and stretch and kind of practice some of the things we talked about. And then I want to do some open discussion and sharing. And James is going to take, kind of take the lead on that. So you kind of think about the sources of stress that you're dealing with as well as some of the things that are working for you or that you would like some advice on, or you might want to share with some other people. I also encourage you to use the chat function and to share through that function if you have some ideas or insights that people can use, also want to let you know that we are video recording this so that other people that couldn't join us today, we'll have some time for that. After a little bit of discussion will also have just a short little exercise on maybe some goal setting force, self-care for ourselves. You get through the next three months because they're probably going to continue to be a challenge. I'm going to share some IU and nationwide resources with you. So it's kind of our idea. I do have a screen where I can see some of you, but if you do have questions and want to interrupt me, please just talk out loud, real loud so I can hear you. And so it'll kind of interrupt me because I won't see you if you raise your hand necessarily. But I am certainly open to having any put input as we go along. If you'd been through some of my presentations before, I seem to use these pictures every time. So, but there's a real purpose behind that. Not only are they cute faces of children, but they remind us of an important fact that I want you all to kind of think about in relation to your own mood, your own feelings, your own thoughts, and yourself. And that fact is that as humans, we have emotions before we have language, we experience emotions, we express emotions. We communicate through emotions, and we begin to learn about emotions even before we have language. And that's a huge point because we're such a language based creature that we oftentimes. I think in some ways overemphasize our language and our rational thought or thought that goes through the process of language. We diminish or downplay our emotions. But they are a core part of who we are. And what are they exactly? They're kind of our reactions to our environment, both internal and external communication system that our body has for us to tell us when something's not right. When something's out of balance, when something's pleasurable. And they're very important as far as a guide to us. We're not always right and are not facts. And we don't need to always act out of our emotions. But they are a core part of who we are and they're important to attend to. And I think in many ways, there's a psychological researcher, Marshall and Han, who talks about them being co-equal with our rational thoughts. And that there's the emotions on one side and rational thought on the other side. And if you think of two circles that inner lock a bet where they overlap is where she says we find wisdom. And so attending to our feelings, recognizing and going what they're telling us, that our experience really important. We're also not going to get rid of emotions. And I think sometimes as mall, we learn messages that we should try to get rid of emotions and simply kind of bought them out. But that's not rational. Some of my clients actually, I think, come to me and they want me to get rid of all their negative emotions. I can't do that. I can get rid of your emotions nor would I want to end stresses like that as well. We can't get rid of stress. But what we can do is learn to manage it better and to kind of work cooperatively with our own emotions and with our own stress levels. So we kind of started with that in mind. That gives us some insight about how to proceed. I think with stress, we're talk a little bit about stress and I won't go over all of these, but stress does have an impact upon us whether we're aware of it or not. A variety of ways. And we'll talk about what stress is in a moment. But a couple of ones that stick out to me. Amanda and I were talking about this the other day. And we can become more accident prone down here in this behavioral area. I don't know if anybody's had a few more accidents over the past six or seven months, but that certainly can be a piece there. You can have a appetite increase or decrease. There can be kind of the lack of sex drive we maybe feeling like we wanted to drink more, may have problems with sleep. Any of those type of behavioral things has an effect upon our mind. We may get kind of muddled thinking, not as clear and rational and our decision-making, we may have some nightmares or impair judgment. We may make some hasty decisions or be a little more negative or irritable, certainly has an effect upon our body. Not only stress, but setting at the computer all the time can give us more headaches, more back aches, more tension in our muscles, may get some twitches. Friend of mine, I can tell when he's under stress because well, it gets a little twitch in his left eye. Another friend of mine, she was used to get irritations around her lips on her on her mouth and she kept thinking there was something seriously wrong and her doctor kept selling or it was stress, change jobs and hasn't had that sense. So you kinda think about how you can manage your stress and not worry as well. And we certainly know that it affects our emotions that can lead to depression, to love, lack of confidence, to some irritability, apprehension, those type of things. So why don't you talk about stress coping and the anxiety response. The state of stress really has two components when we look at it from a psychological perspective. There are the stressor wars and those are the things that create demands upon us, demands for a response. They can be any kind of event, internal or external. So teaching our classes, doing research, Kelly, that's going to be a stressor for all of us. Having some deadlines. We also have internal our own thoughts about ourselves or thoughts about situations. Medical issues can cause us extra stressors, relationship stressors. And right now we all have kind of the ongoing extra stressor of the pandemic, which I think in retrospect we'll all see, has really been traumatic for our entire world and it's something that we'll be dealing with for some time. It's kind of that low level kind of fear that we can't kind of get rid of, that we carry around with us and that impacts our life on a daily basis. Any stressors can be cumulative and so we already have our normal stressors and then we add that covert stress or on top of that. Right now also particularly in our country and in the local areas specifically immovable. Certainly our racial tension in our country has always been a stressor for many people. You know, significantly for African American population. And right now it's at a higher rate for, for them and also for many of those of us who are concerned and care about that. And that's an added stressor that we get through the news and through the reality of kind of the exposure, what people of color than dealing with for years. And two, that our political environment and all the exposure we get to the conflicts that are arising in our country. And I think our stress is really at an all time high. So those are the kind of external things and internal things. And then we have the stress response and that is how we react to it. And this is where something gets really important and as a key insight for us, we can't always control the stressors and we can't necessarily control our response either, but we can improve the way that we respond to the stressors. And that's the one thing that is a little more under our control. And that with some education, some insight and some practice, we can get better at managing within that stress response to things that are really important is how we respond is influenced by both how we judge the event itself, how dangerous is that event, and how do we judge our evaluate our capacity to react or respond to that event? And if we can work on either of those two things. So that old idea, Mills, Well, there certainly are some mountains that we're dealing with right now, but there are also some mole hills that seem like mountains. And so kind of being more objective about those things that are out there and how big are they can infect, how you respond and you're more logical about that. And maybe some of those things down to size where possible, that will improve your response. And if you judge yourself and evaluate yourself to be more effective at managing that stress. And if you learn some ways and increase your ability to respond, then you're going to be able to respond better by having those, that knowledge. I always think of first responders, they go into very stressful situations and they practice for that and they get education around that. They learn how to do that. And over time it becomes less comfortable for that. Most of you, a lot of faculty are here today. In the first couple of times we get in front of the classroom. As early teachers, the stress level is particularly high and we don't evaluate our ability quite as well. Or maybe we haven't prepared for the lecture quite as well. The better prepared we are for those things, then the lower our stress level will be. And people who seem to have a good sense of themselves don't seem to have this negative impact upon stress. So what can we do with that? Well, another thing I'd like to show this picture here, because oftentimes our response to stressful situations involves an activation of the sympathetic nervous system. And what that means is our heart rate increases, our breathing becomes more shallow and rapid. We get muscle tension. And it has to do with how we think about it. It's our perception, our perspective. It's kind of like being on a roller coaster and you're at the top of the roller coaster and we have a couple of people here. She seems like she's maybe show an offer the camera, and she's really excited about the picture. This young lady looks like she's pretty happy. This little girl looks terrified. This boy looks terrified. On a biological level, their body is doing the same things. They're getting the same physiological reactions. But their interpretation of it is different. And that plays a vital role in our reaction to stress. In fact, there's some recent research from Harvard University that shows when put under stress on our body reacts similarly in that way. The differently on the The vascular level. Those individuals that see stress as a threat, as dangerous, as terrible as the worst thing in the world. Their veins and capillaries constrict. When under the same stressful situation that an individual evaluates as a challenge, as an excitement, as this is thrilling, I can't wait to get in there and deal with this challenge. Their capillaries and their blood vessels stay relaxed. That's vital for heart health, for cardiovascular health, for blood pressure, for all of those types of things. Also vital on an emotional level. When you think of trauma, we know that some people experience similar situations and say one group will end up with post-traumatic stress disorder or post-traumatic stress reactions based upon that and other people won't. It's not just a choice. I'm not saying that at all. But how are they prepared and how do they view that? There's a lot of factors that play in to that that are beyond their control. But some are under our control. And the better we are able to kind of manage and kind of evaluate and control the way we see these things. If we see something as I'm dragging this, I don't wanna do this. It's awful. Or more likely to have more negative effects of stress. Whereas if we can find some way to see it as a challenge, as an opportunity and something I can enjoy, or at least something that I know how to manage and I can do this thing, then we're less likely to have the negative effects of stress. So rethinking our thinking is a big piece there. If you've been to many of my presentations, you also have kind of seen this area and kind of talk about the central nervous system. And it talked about the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system. Well, in managing our stress that were hit with a stressful situation, our body is prepared on two levels. The brain level, it does certain things. Nervous system that does this sort of thing. So I like to think of our brain not as a singular organ like most people commonly think about it. The more like a organ system, there are different parts of our brain that control different aspects of our human experience. From language to rational thought, to heart rate, to tension level to fear, to happiness, all these different sub parts within our brain. And they're kind of divided into three major areas called the hindbrain, the midbrain and the forebrain. And you can correlate those with lizards have a very active hindbrain. They don't have a very active or much of a midbrain and they don't have much of a forebrain. This area up here. Mammals and we're one of those. They have a well-developed hindbrain, are lizard brain, they have a well-developed mid-brain, but only the humans have the well-developed forebrain and the other five great apes to some degree as well, but not as well-developed as we do. And whether this is evolved or design is another discipline to kind of talk about. But we know that this is the fact. And that when we're under stress, the first thing that happens for us humans, is our forebrain kinda goes offline. The energy is pushed down to the hindbrain and we go into fight, flight, or freeze. It's all about survival. And really survival isn't the right word. It's about avoiding. We avoid one danger and we might go towards another danger that doesn't seem as immediate. So will run away from the current challenge. And that's a biological thing that happens. The brain also triggers the autonomic nervous system, which is automatic. And specifically the sympathetic nervous system to get us ready for fight, flight or freeze. So we start breathing real quickly. You get a lot of oxygen so we can run are so we can punch someone. Or heart rate increases. Are salivation decreases? Our digestion stops. We divert the energy out our resources to be able to mobilize our body to, to react, rather than taking care of itself and doing the normal types of things. That's really good for short-term stress. But we are not prepared as humans as well for long-term stress. And if we stay in that sympathetic nervous system and that lizard brain too long, then it begins to cause wear and tear on our body, upon our emotions and our mental abilities as well, goes back to some of those consequences I talked about at the very beginning. So what can we do with that information? When we find that our sympathetic nervous system is activated or that we're down here and lizard brain. We need to do things to reactivate the Courts acts and to activate the parasympathetic nervous system on a very biological level. Taking deep breaths is one of those things that we have under our control. Breathing is automatic under the sympathetic nervous system, but it's also under the somatic nervous system. We can consciously choose to regulate that. We can't automatically change our heart rate. But if we breathe slowly and deeply, or heart rate will go down. And that's one way to reactivate that. Making sure that we stay hydrated, stretching, moving our body, getting the muscles loosened up when they're tense is another way to do that. Changing the thing that we're thinking about. If we're worried about that upcoming deadline and all we're focusing is on that deadline. The lizard has scared and wants to run away. If we do some grounding activities and change our mind and distract ourselves, will re-engage the cortical area. And that's the area that's going to be able to finish the work anyway. So we need to get that back online. The lizard is not going to know how to write that paper. But this part of the brain is, and so we've gotta get that brain reactivated. And we do that not by completely avoiding the re-engaging in stimulating some other thoughts, some other activities that we can do. So that's kind of some of the theory, a couple more theory things and we're going to get to some practical applications of this. Said, we would never get away from stress and never be something that will go away. We don't want it to go away. Actually the groundbreaking work because it hurts. Your CS and Dobson. Tell us about stress. We have an x-y axis with performance here. And the level of our stress is down here on the bottom. And you can see that if our stress is too low, we're kind of on underload than were inactive or relate back. And we're not actually challenge to do our best work. Kind of couch potato not doing a whole lot. If we have enough stress, we get into this optimum zone. And we can actually perform at a higher level. If we stay there too long, then we can move into overload and kind of get into the exhaustion. If the stress gets too high, we can either get into a panic attack or anger or some kind of that fight flight or freeze response or into break down if it if it's sustained long-term stress. So I'd like to think of it as a thermostat of how can I modulate this better? I don't know if any of you had this problem, but when I was an undergraduate, I did not know this at all. And I would be over here on the two low stress until the day before the paper was due or the day before the test. And then I'd be over here. And I just kept jumping back and forth between being too low and my stress and too high because I would avoid the deadline. I wouldn't think about the deadline at all. I'd be happy, go lucky over here. And then it snuck up on me and then I was over here. So I had to learn to use a calendar and to plan and to set new deadlines for myself. So if I have three things due on one day, I can't do all the night before. It's just not possible. And many of our students haven't learned that yet. And sometimes as adults we forget that or we don't manage that too well either. So we kind of have to plan are the things that are going to make demands upon us and work those things out so that we can kind of build in times to lower our stress and to take breaks from that stressed whenever possible. So what are some of the things we can do? And I know I'm going pretty quickly, but we're going to get to some discussion time that I want to make sure we get to. These are some strategies and some of them will work for you. Some of them wants to see if there's one or two that kind of stick out to you. But one thing I like to encourage some of my clients to do is to keep a stress log for a week or so and kind of write down the things you can either do it throughout the day or at the end of the day that you find in your environment that are causing you stress. Because oftentimes we're not really aware of all those things and we can evaluate them in the moment that the end of the week we kind of look back at that list and say, wow, okay, that deserve stress as I've done this and sometimes I find that I'm doing some things I don't need to be doing. Or I have some people in my life than are really all that beneficial to me, that they're causing me a lot of stress. And so I've kind of cut some people out my life in the past because really wasn't beneficial for them to be there and they were too much stress and and not kind of the line with my values and my goals. Or I've been able to kind of re distribute some of those things and I have to manage that I find on that log can be really insightful at times. Learn to say no. When I was at Spaulding University, there was a professor in the School of Education and was notorious for saying yes or no when someone asked him to do something, He did not say, oh, I wish I could but I can't because of X, Y, and Z. His purpose and that was to teach people that it was okay to say no, particularly the women he worked with because he realized in our culture, oftentimes women are not kind of power to say no, and they're kind of acculturated that they have to do what's asked of them. A lot of people in our lives who will ask amazing things of us that they really have no business asking and will feel guilty because we won't do that. But it wasn't our responsibility to do it in the first place. Native say no. It feels bad at first, that if you get used to it, it's kind of empowering. Rethink you're thinking. What do I mean by that is kind of cognitive behavioral therapy. We get into pattern ways of thinking. And another was a pessimist and a little paranoid. So I grew up with that pessimism and that paranoia around me. Kind of my default automatic way of thinking. You'll kind of recognize that and say, wait a minute, I don't wanna do that. How do I begin to change that? And one of the things you can begin to do is called rational emotive behavior. That they pay attention converge then this loop up to others. And when you target cell and you find yourself using a lot of negative language, a lot of pessimistic language. If you can kinda check yourself and say, wait a minute, I want to change that and begin to speak more optimistically. Because our feelings follow our thoughts and our thoughts often follow our language and our language kind of rayon doctrine eight US and reinforces the way we think. And so if we can change our language, we can change our thinking, which will then change. Control, influence, and concern. Steven Covey talks about three inner affecting circles with the center circle being the area of your world over which you have some control. The next larger circle is the area of your role. You have influence. And then the largest circle is the area in which you have concern. And he encourages us to try to make sure we focus the majority of our energy and time on the inner two circles. Most energy on the things we can control. The next level on what we can influence and then lesser on which we can we have concern. I think that's particularly important these days with social media, the 24-hour news cycle. I always feel guilty because sister Mary Alice always taught me. You've got to be politically aware, you've got to be politically connected. But that was when there was an hour of news a day and one or two newspapers. And you could trust them. Nowadays, you can't. And you gotta sort through some of that in a few, spend so much of your time kind of in that area of your world that you really have even very little influence over. It will eat you alive and it will cause you to much stress. I get that way all the time around politics and I kind of have to limit myself. I want to be politically aware and I want to vote and I want to influence are things I can. But I don't want to spend 20 hours a day fighting against the things I can even influence. I want to make a difference where I can, because that's going to make me feel more in control of my life. And I'm actually going to make a bigger difference than if I'm out there tilting against windmills. So I encourage you to kind of think through that. With that, turn off the phone, the email, social media. Can you put some limits on that? I took Facebook off my phone because my phone is always with me. And so, you know, every second I will get in between things. I'd be checking Facebook and I get a climbed usually some doses of negativity, R0 check CNN. I'd get doses of negativity and decrease the dosage by that. And I try to attend to things in a more scheduled fashion. So I can still look at Facebook, but maybe for 20 minutes at the end of the day, as opposed to a cumulative of an hour and a 2.5 hours throughout the day. And I can do it without calming down as opposed to during the day. Zoom fatigue is real. So take some breaks. You know, there's a lot of talk out there about blue light classes or blue light filters. I've also heard about some supplements for your eyes. I don't know if any of it that's true, but I'm kinda willing to try anything these days. Scared. Six, staring at the screen is getting really, really tiring. With that also were not moving around as much, but we're setting in front of our computers all day. You know, normally we would walk down the hallway, would say hi to some folks. We would kind of maybe walk across campus. If we're stuck in our house, we're doing a lot less of that and there's a lot more tendency to stay in front of the computer. So we need to kind of try to take breaks from that. Certainly be careful with mood-altering substances. They have the illusion of helping us because they take away a little bit of the initial stress. But over long-term use, they actually lower our baseline and make us more susceptible to stress and can cause some other problems. I'm trying to make a schedule and stick to it. And that's another thing that going into work helped, you know, I find many of us emailing each other at 1011121 o'clock in the morning. We're working all day and at various ours and we're kind of not getting those breaks as much because our schedule can be more flexible, which is a benefit in some ways, but it has some drawbacks to it as well. Certainly spirituality for some folks, I'm going to run through these pretty quickly because I want to get to the next part, what James going to lead a discussion. Make sure you nurture yourself, find some things that you can do as far as in recreation, some fun, some hobbies. You have to invest in yourself. I know for me I've unfortunately taken on more work because of covert. There's been some other opportunities to get some other jobs and that's probably not what I ought to have done and maybe need to make sure I do still make sure I go on a vacation or something like that. Even though I don't know who I'll go with or where I can go to want to fly. So we have to be a little more creative. And what those things were going to do, make sure you get enough sleep, but not too much sleep. Eat well. That might be easier eating at home unless you're not a good cook and maybe he's eating a lot more junk food, exercise. That's something I know I need to get back into. Did it really well consistently for about ten years and felt much better. Seem like I have more time now. And unless likely to do it, maybe rethink your class assignments. Maybe, you know, being at home may give you more time to think about things that you are excited about teaching and about doing. But then does that make it more work on the students? And it really needs to be. And does it make it more work on you on the grading? And I know that's probably all you've been doing the last couple of months is rethinking how your classes are going to be, the kind of reevaluating and where can I kinda make some areas and there that may cause me more stress. As a test easier to gray perhaps in a long paper. Be realistic and try not to overextend yourself. Make sure you bolster your support system. And if need, be, make sure you seek some professional help. You know, mental health is something we have a lot of stigma about. We go to the dentist, we go to the eye doctor. If we have, you know, some health concerns, you go to a health Dr. mini. Mental health issues can be preventable if we intervene, early. Stress can lead to depression, it can contribute to anxiety. Many of these conditions are developed based upon our interaction with our environment and the stress that we're having. Learning new techniques or getting some help early on is much easier than waiting until the disorder has gotten further along. That's true with medical conditions. It's also true with mental health conditions. Maybe just a brief checkup, a session or two might be able to get some people back online as opposed to having to go into long-term, kind of longer term kind of treatment. Also want to point out that there's some acts, some great apps out there for managing stress. Buddha phi, calm. What's up or not? What's app, but what's up? Mood kit, PTSD, Coach. Of these, the heart rate coherence is another really cool one that, you know, ten years ago you'd have to go to a doctor. He or she would have to use devices that cost a couple $100 to be able to take your your pulse and your blood oxygen level. But now our phones do that and our iWatch is due that Apple watches do that. Some of the other more fancy watches do that. And some of the apps train us how to breathe. Diaphragmatic league, deep breathing, slow breathing, which we'll bring down our heart rate and being able to see that on a digital readout and to see that your oxygen levels actually going up and your heart rate is going down, really tells you that you're getting into the parasympathetic nervous system activation and are lowering your stress level. And I would say that that's kinda like why do pro basketball players keep practicing their free throw shots? They do that so it becomes automatic, so it becomes muscle memory. So that in the big game when everything's on the line, they can shut out everything and they can just follow through with that free throw shot. If you learn to deep breathe and if you learn to throw slow down your heart rate. And you practice that even for 510 minutes, you know, two or 34 times a week, you're going to get to where you can do that automatically and you can do it in that next meeting, in that next zoom class. In that next argument you have with your loved one, you're going to be much more effective if you do some practicing of that. So that kinda brings us back to our baby faces and to kinda reminder that those children still live within us. And I encourage you to kinda rediscover some of the joy and the excitement that children have to kind of recognize that you're going to have these emotions. And to kind of not let our ego get in the way so much that we don't pay attention to what our emotions are telling us about ourselves and our environment. So with all that said, oops, a little too far, I want to kind of give you just a little experience of deep breathing. And if you do this with me for just about 30 seconds, and then James is going to take over, kind of lead us through discussion. And there I was. I figured it would take place in a minute. Oftentimes when we're breathing, we're not breathing correctly. For optimum health. Well we want to do is our diaphragm will move up. So actually are lee will move in and our chests will expand. And we usually do not breathe deeply, are slowly enough. As you breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Kind of in time with the Blowfish. In kind of imagine your chest filling up just like the puffer fish does as he breeds, are cheaper. I'll stop it there. You might get a little light-headed if you're not used to doing that, but if you do that kind of regularly, it really will have amazing benefits. This is kind of a cute little version of this. Lot of grade schools are using what's called Conscious Discipline now in their teaching children these techniques to calm themselves down when they get angry or when they get overly emotional. You can use the puffer fish. You Imagine blowing up a balloon and then letting all the air out of a balloon as are some of the things that they're teaching. Some of the kids. With Conscious Discipline can also call it square breathing, where you kinda breathe in a square, breathe, then hold, breathe out. Hold, breathe, then hole in a 44 time. The next one I think I'm not gonna do that because of time and I want to make sure we get to. But if you want to watch this later, it's important to take some stretches and there's a lot of short little videos that this one actually shows people how to stretch right at their desk. And even if you just roll your shoulders. Our arch your back, those type of things, or do some neck rolls. It really is that idea of re-engaging the parasympathetic nervous system. Because the sympathetic nervous system, titans muscles, when we're nervous or worried or stressed and we need to get the blood flowing through those as well. The body also has kind of an automatic evaluation system where it notices on a subconscious level the brain does when we're feeling tense and IT a feedback loop. And then kind of gives our mind the idea that there must be something that I'm worried about. And so it kind of becomes cyclical and kind of be self fulfilling prophecy or kind of escalate the situation. So with that, I'd like to turn it over to James Wilkerson and let him introduce himself to you. If you haven't met him before, he may have a different way of approaching this, but I did kind of get four questions together and we'd like you all to have a little bit of a discussion if you're open to it. So James, turn it over to you. Alright, hey, how's everyone doing? Thank you guys all for tuning in today. You know, the whole purpose. This whole thing is I was sitting in my office and I was thinking I was like, you know, staff and faculty, we have a lot that kind of falls on our shoulders, especially during times like the ones that were in. When it comes to our students. A lot of times our students are looking at our direction for help, for guidance. And, you know, it's on us to kind of help them and guide them. However, as someone who has worked in criminal law in just in a high stress level before area before. I I can say personally that I know that a lot of times when we deal with traumatic things, you know, a lot of times it has a way of kind of stacking up, kind of stacking up inside of our heads. And sometimes we don't realize that stacking until it can be too late. So that was the whole purpose of trying to just get us together during lunch today. It's just a way for us to care for the caretakers, which we are so to speak. So we got a couple open discussion and sharing questions. This is really just a time for us to just kinda chit chat so I can lead us through these, through these questions. I guess maybe the best way is just to, if you want to answer, just hop in there. Hopefully didn't cause too big of a traffic jam, but I'll go ahead and I'll get it started. So the first question is, what have you been doing for self-care? And I answer, yeah, I'll go ahead and start to answer that. One of the things that was on the list and the PowerPoint was learning kind of wind disconnect, especially from social media. I don't know what social media looks like for everyone else here, but my social media has a tendency to be very negative. You know, there's a lot, a whole lot of negativity. Everyone has an opinion. And sometimes that negativity can build up. I can recall a few years ago whenever Collin happening first started kneeling during the National Anthem. Everyone had an opinion on that and I found myself responding and responding, responding until one day I'm sitting on my couch and I physically have a headache and I'm sitting there thinking my while I am buying, I've worked myself up so much that I am physically in pain over something stupid like social media. So I've disconnected, I deleted Facebook off my phone for probably about 4, 4 months and I'd say it was the most relaxing and amazing four months ever. So That's something that I will regularly do for self-care whenever I can. Whenever I feel that stress level kind of building and building disconnect for about a week or two or and I'll come back whenever I feel like it and I'll be refreshed because there's no reason to let social media put me in physical pain. So that's one of the things I've been doing for self-care, but I'd like to hear from you from everyone else. Please chime in on things that you've been doing for self care as well. Kelly Ryan in the comments section said she's been taking walks. Yeah. I feel that on a spiritual level, Kelly, whenever, uh, whenever this pandemic started, it seemed like walking in the park was really all that you were allowed to do. So definitely you can see the value in that. More cat time. Yes, I can see that. Carving out time for yoga. Yeah. Absolutely. Yoga's definitely relaxing. Any any anything else than anyone's doing? Journaling? To do quick vacation? Talking to co-workers? Yeah. I really think that I really think that talking talking to coworkers, talking to friends definitely is something that's strong. You know, I I kind of live in-between the legal world and I guess what I would call the real world. So sometimes there are legal things that are appropriate to talk about that may not be well received whenever I'm talking to non-legal person. So being able to talk with friends and coworkers is that, that's an amazing thing as well. Someone put in there, a mini-trampoline. Yes, we should all have mini-trampolines. That should be part of our package here, at IUS. Alright, so the next question that we have on here is, what do you wish you had been doing for self-care? So maybe some things that you maybe some things that you haven't done. I see trialing, meaning emails for the weekends. Absolutely. Shutting off email notifications. Remembering to do something nice for and let me go. You guys keep on, keep on talk and I'm going to go and I'm gonna put my shadow. Again, Lulu, Amanda said less candy. Yeah. I feel that I feel that for me maybe you replace candy with bourbon. But yeah. Maybe some maybe some are healthier, healthier eating and drinking habits for sure. I'm gripe Hama above. Remember C. Finished your morning routine before turning on the computer. Sure. Ha, more yoga. Someone is tempting me with a great recipe for Barbie crane stick around. So whenever we get off, I'll talk to you about that. Let's see what else do we have here? Maintaining maintaining the same schedule as much as possible? Sure. I think we are I think as humans, we tend to be creatures of habit. So maintaining the same schedule. Shutting down social media at eight o'clock each night. That's a wonderful idea. Too much social media humming. Yeah. I'm with you on that. What suggestions or insights do you have? What are some suggestions for self care that you have? I tell you one suggestion that I have is we have times where we are what we're we're working from home, we're not in the office, were out of our routine. I tell you what. Nothing makes me feel better than waken up and actually just taken the sweat pants and this does the sweat the 30 off and like dressing like I would be at work. I mean, there's just something about it. You look good, you feel good. So that's something that I've been doing. I think that's a really good suggestion is, you know, maybe, you know, dry even if you're going to be sitting in your kitchen. I mean, it just makes you feel good. Let's see. Janet, for or T says reject the idea that you must be working 24-7. Absolutely. I mean, I think that that's been working from home. It can be a gift and occurs. And that whole 24-7 bang, I think definitely falls on the correct side of it. The C blocking out work time on the calendar so you don't get overbooked. Absolute. Once again, that goes along with the working 24-7. Remembering to not eat breakfast and lunch at your desk? That's That goes back to the schedule. I'm you would you would you do that if you were actually in the office? I mean, so yeah, it's kind of trying to fit a separation between your home space in your workspace, as difficult as that may be. Kelley Ryan says socializing. Absolutely. And I know that looks different for everyone right now depending on what code, what your COVID practices are. Socializing. But yeah, certainly, certainly socializing. Don't stay cooped up. You don't have to be perfect. Well, good because I'm not. But yes, remembering that you don't have to be perfect. And then also the golden rule, treating others as, or treating yourself as you would treat others, sure. Hugs. Yeah, hugs. You have to remember to give family members hugs and to make them feel better, but it also makes, makes other people feel good as well. Absolutely. That's one of the things that I kind of, I kind of miss with COVID restrictions, I miss I miss inter-physical interaction. I miss hugs, I miss handshakes. Yeah, we did a little elbow bang, but nothing beats. Get in there with a good hearty hand Shanker given some of the HUD. So yes, Susan, you're correct on that. And then, see, J. L. Doorman, I read an article about balancing risk. If you are more indirect contact with people for one aspect of your life, limiting risk elsewhere in your life. This advice really helps me re-evaluate my sorry, anxiety triggers. Sure. Yeah. If you wouldn't mind. If you could put post the link maybe to that article if you if you still know where it's at, I think that'd be a good thing to read. So we add that link. Put it up there. Coming into the office of new days a week, tell me feel like everyday is not the same name into that. As you can probably tell by looking at where I'm at right now, I'm in the office. I'll tell you. I I love my fiance. I love her so much, but I did not realize how much that eight hour buffer called work. How important that has been to relationships. So working and being next to someone 24 hours a day that can be rough. So yeah, I will come into the office every few days just to kind of, you know, my guess that put that buffer between us so that we can that we can stay, stay saying that c The last question is, what questions do you have for the group? Are there any questions that anyone has betting on us that they're out there and we can maybe answer as a group. Any questions that they want to put it in the chat there. Alright, Kelly says, I'm curious to hear from folks who journal. How do you get motivated to do that? So if anyone wants to put some thoughts in there, I'll tell you. I I go back and forth on journaling some some days, I will hit like maybe a two or three days span where I am I'm hitting it every single day. Other times, live kinda gets busy. And, you know, it's a little bit more difficult to, you know, take some time for journaling. For me, I find that I journaled the best Whenever I make journaling apart of my morning routine. So when I wake up in the morning before, I check Facebook, before I check the news, before I check my email, I'll take about 15 minutes to kind of fill out my journal pages. I have one of those guide journals. So it kinda asked you questions and you just kinda fill the questions out. But doing it doing it first thing in the morning is usually kinda what works for me whenever I me and those those span Trump hitting it. That see, I do a crazed journal in the morning for things that I'm thankful. Thankful of yes. Going and put that in there. So any other thoughts on any other people that do journaling is kind of what motivates you to. I feel like having the right type of journal kinda works as well. Like I said, I have a, I have a guided journal, so it's I think that's really neat. I don't know how would sit down just with a blank page. Let's see. Karla. Karla says, I do the first thing in the morning. I read a devotion and then journal. My motivation comes from the fact that the days I don't journal do not go as smoothly. It helps me work out my anxieties, gives me insight, et cetera. Very, very, very awesome. They're Carla. Okay, there's the article. So if anyone wants to check on that article, Inc. It it's in the chat now, Karla also said that she says I also do a hang on screens moving. I also do a quick gratitude journal at night. It's a part of my data or my bedtime routine. Susan says as to journaling, I DO much, but occasionally I find myself writing my thoughts down. It helps me see things more logically. Sometimes you just have to write it down, right? Sometimes you have to write it down right through it. Sometimes we have to talk through it. But yeah, yeah, did it really helped? I think it's a real organizational tool for our thoughts for sure. So anyone else have any questions that you want to put out to the group? Let's see, JR says I do meditation every day and read my personal affirmation. Absolutely. And that could be that could also tie into journaling as well. I mean, you know, sometimes, you know, sometimes you may want to go back and write about what? You may want to write down that personal affirmation. I personally, I feel their strength and writing things down. You can say it, but when you write it down, then you actually have to take the time to think about what you're writing. So I think there's definitely some strength in that as well. Any last questions getting by us want to put a question out? Well, if there are no other questions, I'm going to send it back to Michael so he can rapids wrap it up. I just wanted to say though, once again, thank you. Sandra says, Can we do this again? Yeah, we can totally do this again if he has felt that this was valuable. Absolutely. We have a lot of stuff coming up. Of course, we Abimelech an election right around the corner. So I feel like there's a little extra stress that is here. Then maybe in years past. So we add that coming around. But thank you guys so much for everything that you do for our students here. I know our students would be lost without you guys. So thank you for everything you do for them. And just please remember to take care of yourself as you are taking care of the students because we need you guys healthy and awesome too. So Michael, do you want to take us home? Kind of building off of that, if you please do send myself James. Anybody else you think of that could help coordinate if you have some other creative ideas, whether you want something like this or if you want more of a small group kind of just to chat with. And so that B were actually doing more talking than we are today. You know, that's some of what we're really missing. I think as those opportunities to have those hallway conversations are those lunch room conversations and there might be some benefits and having some zoom socialization instead of Zoom Meetings. And whether that is done on a large level as are that's done at a departmental level with other people that you would normally socialize with. Maybe some out-of-the-box thinking of how can you get some of those opportunities rebuilt into our, our schedule. So we got two more slides I want to go through real quickly and I just want you to maybe take a minute or two. And if you want to either think about or write down one or two things you can do are three things you can do for yourself over the next three months. And we'll make a personal commitment to something that you can do. And then we may take a moment to share. And you can kind of think about these areas of your life. What could you do, baby? An emotional? Well, for one thing you can do for yourself, intellectual, environmental, spiritual wise, getting back to the community, helping others is a great way to decrease stress. Or financial. You know, a couple of things I've done already. I cut the cable bill. That was a great day and a grow anymore. So think about it for a minute and then we'll kind of open it back up and see if anybody has anything they want to share that they think they can do. And surely ask if I will share the PowerPoint presentation. Yes, I will. I have recorded this, so I should have in the chat access to all of your names so I can look up your emails and I can send you the PowerPoint presentation. Does anyone have any kind of goals that they want to share, that they want to kind of verbally commit to. I'll tell you one thing I'm going to verbally commit to again, maybe this time I'll make it work is to exercise at least three days a week. I have the ability I have right in my house. All I need to do is you need to walk downstairs. So that's one of the things I'm going to do. I also have never taken time off in October, but if I don't use some of my time this year, I'm going to lose it. So I'm committing to take a week off. And during that week, I'm going to do my best not to do any work. If MSF anybody else have things they'd like to somewhat, Manoch is going to eat healthier. Land is going to have more laughter and arrive. Now one of the things I started doing, gene MCR gave me a, a recipe for bread and I started making bread and then I started expanding like a loaf of bread or on my way. So I had to stop that by myself and no one should eat a loaf of bread by themselves before it goes bad. But I was finding myself finding ways to cook with bread, Very powders, and just took a vacation was she normally does not. Good. Matters really push us to do that. It's easy not to take a vacation right now because like I said earlier, it's where do you go, what can you do that we need that. Jeanne has another recipe for me for rebel Lottie. And they have not said that correctly. Rebel ITA, given Lita, it's a heavy weight, is day old or stale bread, so you don't have to eat itself as Bull. Well, if no one else wants to share, that's okay. Down is going to she's doing knitting. Awesome. Okay, I'm going to share a couple more slides with you if I can figure out what I'm suppose to do here. There we go. I want to tell you about some IU resources. We do have the IU EAP employee assistance program. It's a new program this year. Looks like. This is the phone number for 1888881. Link are 5462 and they have a broader range of services than our previous EAP. So they have, I think tell of therapy where you can meet with a counselor online. They may have some face-to-face options as well. They also have some coaching activities and some things, some self-help activities through that organization. And it is free to all faculty and staff who are full-time and unfortunately not available to her. Adjunct faculty, but it's available to full-time faculty and staff. Healthy IU and healthy IU.edu is open to everyone, students, faculty, staff, regardless of your status, they have some trainings like this right now going on and a variety of other activities throughout the year. So meditation activities, I LTE, particularly if you're trying to think about ways to reduce your stress level in the classroom and maybe make different usage of technology or of technology as part of your stress. As it was for me at the beginning today. They can help you to manage that more effectively. Human Resources, Of course, one of the things that they are particularly interested in letting you know is linked in learning. And I'll send you this link along with the entire PowerPoint. We all have access as IU employees to some free training through LinkedIn. You do not have to pay their premium membership to LinkedIn to take part in this part of being a part of I. Sometimes it also can be helpful to give back. And so I want to tell you other things. Many of you may have known that we used to do the out of the darkness walk, but because of Cove it, we're not doing that. But we are doing the out of the darkness experience. That is a pledge walk to support the work of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Suicide is the second leading college circulating cause of death for college students and oftentimes is exacerbated during times like this. And so this Saturday, actually the 17th of October, is our virtual walk. You can walk wherever you are on live stream, on Facebook and Twitter and all those type of things. And there's also a way to give support directly through the website. And that's www dot, AFSP dot org backslash ius. Kinda give a shout out to Sam tack, they gave us $5 thousand. It's not reflected on the website yet, but it will be after the pledge walk is over. But they gave us a great donation to help support that work. I US food pantry, As I said, giving back sometimes can be helpful. We do have a food pantry that is for our students and it's also for faculty and staff. It's really for a member of our community who may find themselves Short-term need of food, you know? So if you want to make a donation to that, either in the form of durable, like dry goods are canned goods. No fresh food please. Or hygiene items are a small like $10 gift certificate or gift card to admire or Kroger. You can do that by taking it to your local school office, whether that's the School of Education, the School of Nursing, should be boxes in each one of those, or to the police department or to our office or drop off boxes for that. So I want you to know that the, I think it would be considered the school of social sciences is putting together a post-election zoom experience on November fourth from six to eight PM. To kind of explain because we're anticipating that this year will be different and that there'll be a lot of uncertainty after the vote and that it may take a while. And so Dr. wort and Dr. Brzezinski, we'll be explaining some of the kind of legal political laws and what the process is going to be like. There'll be also kind of opportunity for people just to gather over Zoom and kind of sharing some support around that. So finally, if I can get my slides to advance there, I'd like to really thank you. James did as well, and I know Kelly and Amanda, the chancellor, and Betty and Dana all feel this as well. You all make the dream come true. For so many of our students, we are life-changing institution that changes their future. That helps them to kinda break maybe the cycle of poverty or the cycle of, of some other negative things in their life, or to advance their life from where it otherwise might be. And that can't be done without you. And your work in whatever role you have at the university contributes to that dream. And that dream means so much to our students, even if they can't always say thank you to you, don't say it every day. I know that they're thankful and so are we so kinda close with that unless anybody else has anything to say. Thank you for given our time today and have a wonderful rest of your week.
