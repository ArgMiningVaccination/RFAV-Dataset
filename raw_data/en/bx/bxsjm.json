But can it also help children cope with [type 1 diabetes](https://www.northwell.edu/endocrinology-diabetes-metabolism/conditions/diabetes)? That's the exciting possibility suggested by a new study led by [Benjamin Nwosu, MD](https://www.northwell.edu/find-care/find-a-doctor/pediatrics/dr-benjamin-udoka-nwosu-md-11515021), a pediatric endocrinologist at [Cohen Children's Medical Center](https://childrenshospital.northwell.edu/about-us). We asked Dr. Nwosu to walk us through the basics of type 1 diabetes, the results of his study and what the findings mean for young people with the disease. People with type 1 diabetes don't produce enough insulin, a hormone that helps control blood sugar. The disease happens when the body's natural insulin factories \u2014 special cells in the pancreas called beta cells \u2014 are damaged or simply stop working altogether. Most kids with type 1 diabetes continue to make some insulin on their own for a while. That's sometimes called the \"honeymoon phase,\" and it can last for years or even decades. Insulin shots are the standard [treatment](https://www.northwell.edu/endocrinology-diabetes-metabolism/treatments) for type 1 diabetes. If untreated, the condition can lead to kidney damage, nerve damage and other long-term complications. Our new research suggests that adding simple vitamin D supplements to the normal treatment plan may help kids with type 1 diabetes by protecting their beta cells, thereby prolonging the honeymoon period. The longer kids can produce insulin on their own, the better off they'll be. Our study included 36 young people, 10 to 21 years old, who were newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Half of them, chosen at random, took vitamin D supplements for a year while the other half took a placebo pill that didn't contain any vitamin D. At the end of the year, the subjects who took vitamin D had significantly lower levels of A1c, a standard measurement that shows how well blood sugar has been controlled in the last three months. After one year, the average A1c of the vitamin D group was 7.6%, while those taking a placebo had an average A1c of 8%. In other words, the young people receiving vitamin D seemed to have an advantage. Vitamin D is known to reduce inflammation. We believe that could be the key: It may be that by protecting beta cells from harmful inflammation, vitamin D gives them a chance to produce more insulin on their own. In the study, the group receiving vitamin D had lower levels of a compound that's a sign of inflammation, so that gives us an important clue. Yes, which is also promising. People with type 2 diabetes have trouble controlling blood sugar even though their body still makes insulin. A 2019 study that combined the results of 19 previous studies concluded that vitamin D supplements can help people with type 2 diabetes control blood sugar and improve the effectiveness of insulin, at least in them short term. The researchers concluded that vitamin D can be thought of as a \"therapeutic agent\" that can be a part of a treatment plan. I agree with that conclusion: For people with type 2 diabetes, vitamin D should be part of their plan to manage their disease. Vitamin D is so important that the body has developed a way to make it without the need for supplements or even food. All it takes is the power of sunlight. Kids will make at least some vitamin D on their own when sunlight touches their skin. It's just one more reason why kids should spend time playing outdoors. Vitamin D can also be found in fortified milk and orange juice, some fortified cereals, egg yolks and fatty fish such as tuna and salmon. Even so, many kids in the US fall short. A nationwide survey conducted in 2014 found that 28% of kids aged 12 to 19 and 13.7% of kids aged 6 to 11 had less-than-optimal levels of vitamin D. Some kids are more likely to be low in vitamin D than others. Children who are overweight are especially likely to be low in D. Kids with dark skin are also likely to be low on D, because the melanin in dark skin blocks much of the sunlight that the body needs to make the vitamin on its own. Kids who live in northerly places where the sun is relatively scarce for months at a time \u2014 places like New York City, Boston or Seattle \u2014 are also at risk. Kids with type 1 diabetes are especially likely to be low in D, possibly because the disease makes it harder for their bodies to process the nutrient. A 2020 study of nearly 400 kids with the disease found that 64% were short on D, including 4% who were extremely low. It's still too early to say for sure that vitamin D supplements can make a big difference for all or most children with type 1 diabetes, but the supplements are inexpensive and safe so there's no real downside. I believe that all children should have their vitamin D levels checked with a simple blood test. The test is especially important for children with type 1 diabetes. If they have less than 50 nmol/L (50 nanomoles of vitamin D per liter of blood), they should start taking a supplement. This is good advice for all kids, not just those with diabetes. Kids under 10 can take up to 1,000 international units (IU) a day, and older kids can take 2,000 IU. They should have their levels checked again in six to eight weeks to make sure they're reaching healthy levels. There are two types of vitamin D supplements, D3 and D2, but they both seem to work equally well. The body easily breaks down excess vitamin D, so there's not much risk of an overdose. Still, it's best to stick to the guidelines. Don't give your child more than 1,000 IU to 2,000 IU per day unless directed by their doctor. Parents of children with type 1 diabetes shouldn't expect miracles from vitamin D, and they definitely shouldn't skimp on or stop other treatments such as insulin shots. Certainly you should consult your child's doctor, but the new study suggests that vitamin D offers extra protection without much effort or expense. Whether children get their vitamin D from sunshine or supplements, it can be a helpful boost to their health now and for many years to come. "}
