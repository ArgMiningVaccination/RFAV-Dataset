And doctors say toddler formula should not be given to infants.

Summaries Of The News: [ In A First, Federal Panel Recommends Anxiety Screening For Adults Under 65 ](https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/in-a-first-federal-panel-recommends-anxiety-screening-for-adults-under-65/) The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force began its review before covid-19 hit, but the pandemic greatly exacerbated the issue. Some primary care physicians expressed concern that adding an additional responsibility to their checklist for patient appointments is implausible, The New York Times reported. [ The New York Times: Health Panel Recommends Anxiety Screening For All Adults Under 65 ](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/20/health/anxiety-screening-recommendation.html) A panel of medical experts on Tuesday recommended for the first time that doctors screen all adult patients under 65 for anxiety, guidance that highlights the extraordinary stress levels that have plagued the United States since the start of the pandemic. The advisory group, called the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, said the guidance was intended to help prevent mental health disorders from going undetected and untreated for years or even decades. It made a similar recommendation for children and teenagers earlier this year. (Baumgaertner, 9/20) [ AP: US Adults Should Get Routine Anxiety Screening, Panel Says ](https://apnews.com/article/science-health-covid-mental-b6bdfec54c16ff04ca18bba18000bbf9) The recommendations are based on a review that began before the COVID-19 pandemic, evaluating studies showing potential benefits and risks from screening. Given reports of a surge in mental health problems linked with pandemic isolation and stress, the guidance is \"very timely,\" said Lori Pbert, a task force member and co-author. Pbert is a psychologist-researcher at the University of Massachusetts' Chan Medical School. The task force said evidence for benefits, including effective treatments, outweighs any risks, which include inaccurate screening results that could lead to unnecessary follow-up care.

[ ABC News: Internal FDA Report On Infant Formula Crisis Details Shortfalls In Response ](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/internal-fda-report-infant-formula-crisis-details-shortfalls/story?id=90233886) An internal review of the Food and Drug Administration's actions leading up to the infant formula crisis finds a combination of human error, antiquated technology, and poor communication and accountability amongst an already threadbare food workforce all contributed to a perfect storm of problems which exacerbated the supply shortage. The issue was only worsened by the FDA's lack of a robust mandate to strong-arm industry players' compliance, the review found.

FDA Chief Robert Califf noted that the agency had provided a detailed timeline of its response and that an independent review of the larger FDA foods division is ongoing. \"We're not going to spend a lot of time going back,\" Califf said. \"We're going to spend our time taking into account what happened then and moving forward.\" (Lee, 9/20) Also \u2014 [ KHN: Formula May Be Right For Infants, But Experts Warn That Toddlers Don't Need It ](https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/formula-infants-toddlers-federal-standards-nutrition/) Formulas for toddlers are a burgeoning business in the United States: Sales of the drinks more than doubled in recent years as companies convinced parents that their little ones needed the liquid boost. But many experts warn that these products, designed for children ages 1 to 3, fill no nutritional needs beyond what is available in a typical toddler diet, are subject to less regulation than infant formula, and are expensive. In addition, some parents feed the toddler versions to infants even though they do not meet federal standards for infant formula and may not provide babies with adequate nutrients to sustain their growth.

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said the president's earlier words didn't align with the administration's actions. And a report shows that covid is still killing people, but in different demographics.

Biden attended a Democratic National Committee fundraiser in New York City ahead of his speech Wednesday to the United Nations General Assembly. At one point, speaking about efforts on the pandemic, Biden referenced his comments to Scott Pelley of CBS last week in which he said the pandemic was \"over.\" (Samuels, 9/20) [ Over' Remark Doesn't Align With Policy ](https://www.bangordailynews.com/2022/09/20/politics/susan-collins-joe-biden-pandemic-comments/) Sen. Susan Collins on Tuesday hit President Joe Biden for calling the COVID-19 pandemic \"over,\" saying his comments did not align with his administration's actions.

But the number of people dying \u2014 and the demographics of those falling victim \u2014 has shifted notably from the first two years. Given the collective immunity people have garnered through a combination of mass vaccination and protections built from earlier infections, Californians overall were far less likely to die from covid in 2022, when the omicron variant dominated, than during the first two years of the pandemic, when other variants were largely at play, amplifying a national trend.

But the collection it did manage to build hasn't done much more than gather dust. The state acquired 8,555 ventilators at a cost of $166 million and 1,179 X-ray machines for $86.4 million, state officials told POLITICO this month. And now they're stacked in warehouses across New York with no plans to distribute them or put them to any immediate use; Covid treatments have largely moved away from ventilators, and hospitals say they have plenty available to deal with their immediate needs.
