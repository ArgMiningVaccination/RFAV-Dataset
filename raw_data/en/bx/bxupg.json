Talented stars, killer physiques. At age 62, \"Big Bill\" shares his wisdom to dominate one of the ultimate strength marks. Follow these fit women we're crushing on for inspiration, workout ideas, and motivation. Have you ever felt like your zest for life has been sucked out of you? Loss of vitality can happen at any age and for many reasons. For me, it occurred just before my 40th birthday. The love of my life found a younger woman and filed for divorce, I had to move out of my dream home, and just weeks later, I was laid off from my job. My world turned upside down, and I found myself at absolute rock bottom. If that wasn't bad enough, I was experiencing a lot of body image issues. Mainly from hormonal changes causing me to have- zero sex drive, low energy, moodiness, muscle loss, horrible PMS symptoms, and on a really good night, maybe five hours of restless sleep. To add salt to my wounds, there were also the natural things that creep up with aging. A few more gray hairs, new wrinkles and my skin was suddenly dull and sagging. After feeling sorry for myself for a little while, I decided to stop being a victim. These circumstances weren't necessarily my fault, but I knew I could do a better job of how I was dealing with and reacting to them. I started a year-long self-healing journey - mentally, spiritually and physically. This involved a lot of self-help books, therapy, spiritual realignment, and a healthy balance of alone time and girls' nights that probably involved a little too much wine. During a long chat with my best friend, I was venting about how I finally felt healed and even ready to date again but was still suffering from mental and physical issues that no amount of exercise, self-help or therapy was fixing. She asked me if I'd ever tried supplementing with natural herbs and vitamins that help with these things and suggested that I try [The Female Vitality Stack](https://www.innosupps.com/products/female-vitality-stack) by [Inno Supps](https://www.innosupps.com/). She raved about how it helped her with some of the exact things I was complaining about- no desire for sex, PMS, hormone imbalance, restless nights, and signs of aging. Desperate to get my life back, I decided to order it and give it a shot. They offer a 30-day money-back guarantee \u2014 so I figured I had nothing to lose. I know there is no such thing as a \"miracle pill or powder,\" but I couldn't believe what was happening. After only one month of using the Female Vitality Stack, I noticed a difference. Then after 3 months of consistent use, I felt like I was back to my \"pre mid-life crisis\" self. Honestly, I felt and looked better than I did in my 20s!! Maybe you can relate to my story; perhaps you can't. But no matter your age or circumstances, we all lose our \"vitality\" at some point, and aging is inevitable. If you want to bounce back naturally (or even prevent these things from happening), keep reading to learn more about...

I Gave My Body A Collagen Boost with Inno Supps Hair + Skin + Nails Of all the products in the Female Vitality Stack, this one might be my favorite. Maybe that's speaking from a place of slight vanity, but cut me some slack; after all, my husband did ditch me for a younger woman.

This was wrecking my self-esteem. But thanks to the unique way that Inno Supps [Hair + Skin + Nails](https://www.innosupps.com/products/hair-skin-nails) boosts the body's ability to produce collagen naturally, my hair, skin and nails have never looked better!

Conclusion During my healing journey, I listened to a bunch of podcasts and Ted Talks. During one of them, somebody said- \"The opposite of depression is not happiness; it's vitality.\" I realized that's what I was lacking\u2014vitality I took big steps and little steps throughout my journey of returning to my happy and healthy self. Finding the Female Vitality Stack was no doubt the missing puzzle piece.
