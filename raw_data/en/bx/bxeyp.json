Our unique Colon Cleanse formula with Lactobacillus Acidophilus helps remove the heavy build-up that's clogging your digestive system. Our gentle and effective ingredients promote a healthy colon by reducing toxins naturally. No harsh chemicals to throw your digestive system off balance. Once the built-up toxins have been removed from your colon, you can experience relief from bloating, gas, constipation and diarrhea. Colon Cleanse can help provide the additional benefit of helping you achieve healthier weight loss goals. Turmeric's active ingredient curcumin has been shown to be a potent antioxidant, and helps provide important support for healthy liver function, bile production, and detoxification. Since curcumin is difficult to absorb, our formula includes BioPerine\u00ae, a patented source of piperine, the active compound found in pepper. BioPerine\u00ae has been clinically shown to increase the bioavailability of nutrients. Digestive Enzyme with Makzyme-Pro\u00ae Blend supports healthy digestion and maximum nutrient absorption. The enzymes assist the body in breaking down difficult proteins, promoting a healthy metabolism, supporting healthy weight management, and providing a healthy inflammatory response to toxins and free radicals. Omega 3 Fish Oil supports brain and nerve health, memory, mood, and cognition, and promotes a balanced inflammatory response, among other benefits. In this unique formula, Vitamins D3 and K2 work closely together to maximize health benefits. K2 directs calcium to where it benefits the body - towards bones and teeth - and away from arteries, which become damaged when they're calcified. K2 also supports healthy insulin production and discourages premature wrinkles that develop as a result of vitamin K deficiency. Working in tandem with K2, D3 increases calcium absorption, which strengthens bone density and reduces the risk of osteoporosis. During pregnancy and lactation, D3 benefits the health of both mother and child. Additional benefits of D3 include supporting healthy immune system function, helping muscles and nerves, and increasing the absorption of phosphorus. Super Fulvic Minerals, also called \"The Ultimate Nutrient Booster\", contain more than 100 micronutrients, 18 amino acids, 13 organic acids, trace minerals, electrolytes, prebiotics, and probiotics. In particular, probiotics and prebiotics in Super Fulvic Minerals nourish the gut, help maintain a healthy balance of beneficial bacteria, and promote optimal immune function. Probiotic 40 Billion CFU supports healthy gut bacteria by providing high potency, balanced, and beneficial bacteria. By taking this product on a regular basis, Probiotic 40 Billion CFU can assist in maintaining healthy intestinal flora. "}
