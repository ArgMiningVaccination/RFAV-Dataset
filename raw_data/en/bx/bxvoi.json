To increase the positive results, drink plenty of water and follow a whole foods diet. Long, unsupervised cleanses can deplete the body of critical nutrients which is why we recommend you do so under the guidance of a qualified and knowledgeable healthcare practitioner. Especially if you are taking medication or other herbs and need to be concerned about drug-drug or drug-herb interactions. What drugs interact with St. John's Wort? St. John's wort is known for its mood-elevating properties, but it can interfere with many prescription medications such as antidepressants, antibiotics, birth control pills, blood pressure medication, organ transplant medication, HIV medication, anticonvulsants, blood thinners, and asthma medication.
