A little about Steve and Crystal Pump: \"I am Strongman Steve and Crystal Pump is my product. I started taking pre-workout back in 2008, with products like NOXplode, White Flood, and Redline. In 2009 I was introduced to jack3d by a local vitamin store employee, and it changed my life. I had never experienced such extreme focus. The hype was extreme, the taste was horrific, and the workouts were legendary. The popularity led to a rise in other extreme high performance products that I call \"the Golden Age of Pre-Workout.\" What has followed has been a decade of disappointment. Weak, underdosed formulas made for the masses. Companies could take advantage of the hype of the legendary (now banned) products to shill cheap garbage. It was back to the formulas of 2008 all over again. Some companies choose to still add DMAA and DMHA to their blends (illegally), but to be honest I got tired of crashing and being useless for the rest of my day after my workout and being unable to sleep. Even worse \u2014 I had extreme energy at the start of my workout, only to have nothing by the time I got to accessory. I tried many competitor products, then disgusting home made formulas from bulk products (and no flavoring) and did rigorous research on what ingredients are the most effective in a pre-workout supplement. The result is a product LOADED with high quality ingredients at actual effective doses. I am transparent with the ingredients in this product and don't have to hide behind a \"proprietary blend\" like other industry standard products. Crystal Pump feels like no other product because no other product goes so far above and beyond with the formula. I don't just want an effective product: I want the most effective product you've ever used. State sales tax of 7% will be added to FLORIDA purchases only. There is no sales tax for any other state. "}
