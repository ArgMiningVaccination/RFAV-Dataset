What does acupuncture treat? The list of conditions and clinical indication for acupuncture is extensive, and includes pain, stress, addiction, mental and emotional health, gynecological disorders, digestive problems and more. Chinese Medicine approaches the whole person, and treats not just the branch symptoms, but also tries get to the root of the problem and treat it. See a list of conditions for which the World Health Organization has endorsed the use of acupuncture for treatment here: http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/pdf/s4926e/s4926e.pdf 2. Is it safe? Acupuncture is non toxic and there are minimal adverse reactions. Acupuncture and herbal medicine is safe, and has been used for 2,500 years in China, and has spread around the world. The acupuncture needles are sterile, and only used once. Herbs used are tailored to each individual, and when available, I use herbs that have been tested for purity and quality. Most patients experience no negative side effects. 3. Will acupuncture hurt? The needles used are very fine, and a lot thinner than needles used for shots or blood draws you may have had. There may be a little discomfort or sensations of warmth, electricity, or qi/energy with the insertion of needles. Sensations are normal and part of the therapeutic effect. Many patients report that acupuncture makes them feel very relaxed and they experience a feeling of well being with the treatment. 4. How many treatments will I need? Because every person and health concern is different, the number of treatments needed varies. Some conditions like colds or acute headache may resolve quickly in one or two treatments. Chronic conditions like autoimmune disorders or long-term pain may resolve more slowly, and will require more treatment or ongoing follow up. I will communicate with you about how many treatments I recommend. 5. What is your specialty? In my training to become an acupuncturist I was taught how to prevent, diagnose, and treat a wide variety of health conditions using the fundamental tools of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Much of my clinical experience has been working with people living with HIV and other immune disorders, addiction, and all sorts of pain. During my internship in the hospitals of Zhe Jiang University in Hangzhou China, I did rotations in internal medicine, gynecology, dermatology, and acupuncture. I have had specialty training by NADA (National Acupuncture Detoxification Association), in treating patients with substance use, and by Misha Cohen, OMD L.Ac, to treat people living with Hepatitis C. I enjoy working with all sorts of patients, especially those with chronic health conditions where harm reduction and TCM can provide new treatment options. 6. Do you take insurance? How do I pay? No, due to the small nature of my current practice, I do not do insurance billing. I accept cash and checks, due at time of service. "}
