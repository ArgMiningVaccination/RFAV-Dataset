Stimulant medications such as Adderall and Ritalin work by altering levels of neurotransmitters in the brain; higher levels of dopamine and norepinephrine are known to improve attention and focus. Therapy works by helping people with ADHD understand the condition, discuss their areas of difficulty, and develop behavioral strategies to manage their symptoms.
