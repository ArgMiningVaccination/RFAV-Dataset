These have been developed by our team of herbalists to promote calm, reduce anxiety, and help keep your emotions in check when times get tough. There are many herbs that can be beneficial to relieve symptoms of stress and anxiety, in various ways. Many herbs have a direct effect on the nervous system, and combined with a healthy diet and lifestyle, can be of great help to ease stress and anxiety. There is also a growing body of research demonstrating the strong linkages between the health of the nervous system to that of our gut and its microbiota - so focusing herbal support on balancing the gut flora may be a great strategy for treating disorders of the nervous system. Interestingly, many herbs that are considered \"nervines\" (that help balance the nervous system) are often also prescribed for digestive concerns: such as chamomile, lemon balm or rose - which we cover in a little bit more detail below. There are herbs that can uplift the spirits, ease anxiety, soothe grief and heartbreak, relax muscles, improve memory and focus and support sleep; there are also those known as [\"adaptogens\"](https://www.zenmaitri.com/blogs/news/adaptogen-guide)that can improve our resilience to physical and mental stress and improve energy and vitality. There is a large range of herbs known as \"nervines\" that strengthen and support the nervous system in a variety of ways. Beyond herbal support, it is of course important to note that physical problems that are linked to stress can benefit from a psychological approach, such as through psychotherapy, and/or by working through the body, for example with breathing exercises, relaxation, yoga, exercise, massage, or meditation. Research on meditation shows that it can enhance our resilience to stress, reduce cortisol levels, lower blood pressure and help with negative emotions. Taking a hot bath with a relaxing mix of herbs, essential oils and bath salts (such as our [Unwind Bath Salts](https://www.zenmaitri.com/products/unwind-bath-salts)) can also ease muscle tension and soothe anxiety. A traditionally known example of a herb used to ease stress is chamomile. It is also a trusted digestive herb for excess wind and spasms in the gut that can also be associated with stress. Chamomile also has other notable properties of pain relief, especially for headaches. Another herb often indicated for stress is lemon balm. It helps to calm a tense and anxious mind and enhances memory retention, concentration and mental clarity. It uplifts the mood and is a mild sedative and pain reliever, helping combat stress-induced insomnia. Lemon balm also soothes stress-related digestive problems such as spasms and gas. Another example is rose: rose petals are uplifting, calming and cooling. They help with anxiety, stress and irritability. They also help ease excess stomach acidity, which can often accompany high levels of stress. All three of these herbs, as well as holy basil (or tulsi) and vervain are included in our [Balance Tea](https://www.zenmaitri.com/products/balance-tea), which was designed to ease stress and to help increase vitality and resilience when faced with it. It also tastes delicious! Our Balance Tincture contains chamomile as well but has an increased focus on specifically [adaptogenic](https://www.zenmaitri.com/blogs/news/adaptogen-guide)herbs like rhodiola and ashwagandha, to support your adrenals in functioning healthily and to help you cope with stress. There are other calming herbs for acute anxiety that can be prescribed on a case-by-case basis, as part of a bespoke prescription \u2014 we recommend [speaking with a medical herbalist](https://www.zenmaitri.com/products/natural-health-consultation)about this if you are experiencing acute anxiety. A good natural supplement for stress should contain herbs that support the nervous system, herbs that support a healthy digestion (since there is strong evidence of the many links between a healthy gut flora and digestive system and a healthy nervous system), and promote resilience to stress ( [adaptogens](https://www.zenmaitri.com/blogs/news/adaptogen-guide)). In our [Balance Supplements](https://www.zenmaitri.com/products/adapt-capsules), you will find rhodiola, an adaptogen which eases stress and boosts energy and mood; ashwagandha, which supports physical and emotional resilience to stress, reduces low mood and increases sleep quality and duration; chamomile, which gently soothes tension and stress and supports a healthy digestion (easing spasms, bloating and indigestion); as well as tulsi or holy basil, which is nourishing, balancing and uplifting for both body and mind, and can also help reduce indigestion and heartburn.

Herbal medicine hosts a world of possibilities to help relieve stress. There are herbs that can strengthen and tone the nervous system (\"nervines\"), uplift the spirits, ease anxiety, soothe grief and heartbreak, relax muscles, improve memory and focus and support sleep; there are also those known as [\"adaptogens\"](https://www.zenmaitri.com/blogs/news/adaptogen-guide)that can improve our resilience to physical and mental stress and improve energy and vitality. A medical herbalist's approach is holistic and will always include an in-depth assessment of your medical history and body systems' health and vitality. After a herbal consultation, in addition to a herbal prescription you may receive some lifestyle and dietary advice and/or referrals to other medical professionals that can provide complementary support (e.g. psychotherapists). Herbal medicine can also work very well alongside other treatments and approaches you may be following. If you are looking for some general support with your stress levels, we recommend exploring our [Balance line](https://www.zenmaitri.com/collections/calm)(containing a herbal tea, a herbal tincture and herbal supplements), which was expertly crafted by our team of medical herbalists to promote calm, reduce anxiety, and to promote resilience to physical and emotional stress.

Herbal tinctures are often prescribed to ease stress and help rebuild energy levels, but the specific approach and herbs used will often vary greatly from patient to patient. Examples may include promoting better nutrient absorption to help replenish vitamin and mineral levels, supporting an overly exerted adrenal system, supporting better detoxification to eliminate metabolic waste, and modulating immune function. Although we always advise having a consultation with a medical herbalist to find the perfect prescription for you, our [Balance tincture](https://www.zenmaitri.com/products/balance-stress-tincture)can be helpful if you are experiencing a temporary increase in stress or decrease in energy levels - it contains adaptogen herbs that increase physical and mental resilience to the effects of stress, and promote calm and relaxation whilst uplifting the spirits. There are many great herbs that help combat stress.

Great herbs to combat stress include chamomile, lavender and rose, as well as adaptogens like ashwagandha, liquorice and holy basil. You will find many of these in our [Balance line](https://www.zenmaitri.com/collections/calm)of herbal products, which was expertly crafted by our team of medical herbalists to promote calm, reduce anxiety, and to promote resilience to physical and emotional stress. As an example, ashwagandha has a millenary history of use as an adaptogen and a tonic for debility in Ayurvedic medicine, with over 4,000 years of traditional use. A range of clinical trials have shown that the herb can be safely used and that it has anti stress, adaptogenic, anxiolytic and immunomodulatory activity. Anxiety can be eased to an extent thanks to herbs like lemon balm, vervain, rose, lavender, or chamomile. There are also other calming herbs for acute anxiety that can be prescribed on a case-by-case basis, as part of a bespoke prescription \u2014 we recommend [speaking with a medical herbalist](https://www.zenmaitri.com/products/natural-health-consultation)about this if you are experiencing acute anxiety.

However, if you are looking for the best natural medicine to ease stress, we would strongly recommend consulting [a medical herbalist](https://www.zenmaitri.com/products/natural-health-consultation). Stress and anxiety can be complex, and will require attention to a range of physical and psychological factors. In a herbal medicine consultation, a herbalist will perform an in-depth assessment of your presenting complaints, of medical history and of your body systems' health and vitality. After a herbal consultation, in addition to a bespoke herbal prescription you may receive some lifestyle and dietary advice and/or referrals to other medical professionals that can provide complementary support (e.g. psychotherapists). Herbal medicine can also work very well alongside other treatments and approaches you may be following. There are herbs that can safely help relax children, but we recommend consulting a medical herbalist before using herbs with babies and children, as they are more sensitive to their active compounds than adults. For example, dill can be used to ease colics in babies and children and help them to relax and to sleep; chamomile can also be used in a similar way. A great way to use them is to make an infusion with them and add it to the bath. We also recommend massaging your baby to relax them and nourish their skin. You can also use our natural [Baby Massage Oil](https://www.zenmaitri.com/products/baby-massage-oil)for this. Baby massage benefits newborn babies with growth support and thermoregulation, complementing the skin's protective function and enhancing the lasting bond between parent and child. Our herbalists have created this gentle, softening oil with sweet almond and calendula to soothe and nourish your baby's delicate skin during this precious ritual. Ashwagandha is a great herb to make you calm. Also called Indian Ginseng, it has been shown to support physical and emotional resilience to stress, to reduce low mood and increase sleep quality and duration. It increases energy levels but is non-stimulating, unlike caffeine. Chamomile is another herb that helps make you calm: it is well known for its ability to help children sleep by gently easing tension, but it is equally beneficial for adults in this way. It is also a great digestive herb to ease spasms, bloating and indigestion which can often be associated with stress. It also has pain-relieving properties which make it helpful to soothe headaches \u2014 another common symptom of stress and tension. These are just two examples - there are many other natural medicines that can help ease stress - to find the best one for you, we recommend [speaking with a medical herbalist.](https://www.zenmaitri.com/products/natural-health-consultation)Ashwagandha and chamomile can both be found in our [Balance supplements](https://www.zenmaitri.com/collections/calm/products/adapt-capsules)and in our [Balance tincture](https://www.zenmaitri.com/collections/calm/products/balance-stress-tincture), and we also carry specific [ashwagandha supplements](https://www.zenmaitri.com/collections/calm/products/ashwagandha-capsules). There are potently relaxing and sedative herbs like wild lettuce that can calm anxiety, panic attacks, hyperactivity, restlessness and agitation. Herbs like this are so deeply relaxing that they are great for inducing sleep. It is best to avoid taking them during the day if you want to stay fully awake and alert! Wild lettuce is one of the herbs in our [Deep Sleep tea](https://www.zenmaitri.com/products/night-time-tea-50g). More widely, there are many remarkable herbs that can reduce stress, promote relaxation and benefit the nervous system more generally. These herbs are usually referred to by herbalists as \"nervines\". Nervines often strengthen the nervous system, helping our sensory ability become more finely tuned and receptive; they are often also adaptogenic, which means they help the body to adapt to the stresses of modern-day life. There are many different types of \"nervines\", as herbs can support the nervous system in various ways. The ones mentioned in the above paragraph are sedative; others can be gently stimulating, others calming, some cause muscle spasms to relax, others are pain relieving. Most herbs fall into more than one of these groups. There are relaxing, balancing and adaptogenic herbs such as [ashwagandha](https://www.zenmaitri.com/collections/calm/products/ashwagandha-capsules)that calm body and mind but without a sedative effect, and that can be taken throughout the day. It is important to [consult a medical herbalist](https://www.zenmaitri.com/products/natural-health-consultation)to find the nervines that best match the specific presentation of your symptoms. Our [Balance tea](https://www.zenmaitri.com/products/balance-tea)is great to ease stress and anxiety. It was lovingly crafted by Zen Maitri's Medical Herbalists to help increase your vitality and resilience when faced with stress. It can be enjoyed daily as part of a relaxing ritual. This blend includes chamomile, vervain, tulsi, and lemon balm - powerful herbs that will help you navigate challenging times and support your physical and mental health through them. It tastes wonderfully floral, sweet, earthy and mildly bitter. There are also other calming herbs for acute anxiety that can be prescribed on a case-by-case basis, as part of a bespoke herbal prescription \u2014 we recommend [speaking with a medical herbalist](https://www.zenmaitri.com/products/natural-health-consultation)about this if you are experiencing acute anxiety. A large number of herbs can help calm the nerves. Many herbs are remarkable in their ability to reduce stress, anxiety, to calm the nerves and to benefit the nervous system more generally. These herbs are usually referred to by herbalists as \"nervines\". Nervines often strengthen the nervous system, helping our sensory ability become more finely tuned and receptive; they are often also adaptogenic, which means they help the body to adapt to the stresses of modern-day life. There are different types of \"nervines\": herbs can support the nervous system in various ways. Some are gently stimulating, others calming, some cause muscle spasms to relax, others are pain relieving. Most herbs fall into more than one of these groups. It is important to consult a medical herbalist to find the nervines that best match the specific presentation of your symptoms. Lemon balm is a great example of a nervine herb that helps to calm the nerves. It nourishes and fortifies nerve tissues, uplifts the mood and improves memory and alertness. It reduces tension, anxiety and agitation and can relieve headaches. You can find it in our [Rose and Lemon Balm Tea](https://www.zenmaitri.com/products/rose-and-lemon-balm-50g), a deliciously fragrant tea that can soothe tension and lift your spirits. If you are struggling with your mental health, there are some herbal allies that can provide some support through your journey. For example, wild oats, lemon balm, rosemary or Saint John's wort can help to lift the spirits and replace essential nutrients that are necessary for your nervous system. Saint John's wort has clinically well-established effects to treat mild and moderate forms of depression, and it is registered in the UK for the treatment of 'slightly low mood and mild anxiety'. Although multiple clinical trials clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of extracts of the plant against depression compared to placebo and to other conventional medicines, the precise mechanisms of action for the antidepressant effect of the herb is yet unclear. Studies suggest that extracts of Saint John's wort inhibit the uptake of key neurotransmitters including serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline and GABA, and that they may have effects on cortisol levels. It is key to note that Saint John's wort can have significant interactions with other conventional medicines, either amplifying or lowering their effects \u2014 particularly other conventional antidepressant drugs, so it is extremely important not to self-medicate with it without consulting a herbalist first, especially if you are taking antidepressant medication.
