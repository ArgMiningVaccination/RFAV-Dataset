Anthropologists for years have studied these pictures and the lives of our hairy, thick-skulled ancestors. But now another group, fitness buffs, is paying closer attention to the caveman. Why? He wasn't fat. What was his secret? Why are 100 million Americans overweight today when the Neanderthals and Cro-Magnons who preceded us were so lean and ripped? They looked like, as Snooki would say, \"gorilla juiceheads.\" The devotees of the Paleo Diet believe it's the way they ate. \"The essential principle is we spent 19 million years evolving to eat a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, and 10,000 years ago we had the agricultural revolution,\" says Lurene Grenier, 28, of Severna Park, who has been eating the Paleo diet for two years. \"The upside of that revolution is it helped build up society. The downside is it made us very sick.\" Thus, the Paleo diet is an attempt for humans to \"eat the way we did before the agricultural revolution,\" says Grenier, who works as a security researcher and trains clients at a Glen Burnie gym, Crossfit BWI. That means no grains, no dairy and, above all, no sugar. In other words: no Joe Squared pizza, Starbucks' macchiatos or Sugarbakers' red velvet cake. \"It's basically the opposite of the government's food pyramid,\" Grenier says. Advocates of the Paleo diet \u2014 which stands for Paleolithic period (think mammoths, sabertooth tigers, and hair all over your body) \u2014 say you'll lose weight if you eat as they do. But more than that, they say, you'll start sleeping better, your headaches (even migraines) will go away, your mood will improve and you'll get sick much less. Donna Pierce, the co-owner of Arenal Fitness in Baltimore, began eating Paleo in September, after her gym launched a month-long contest challenging its participants to eat like a caveman. \"I ended up absolutely loving it,\" says, Pierce, 38, of Owings Mills, who lost about 10 pounds and dropped a clothing size. She says she's noticed all kinds of changes. \"I sleep better and I'm in a better mood,\" she says. \"I used to get very irritable and cranky. That never happens any more. My blood sugars are much more stabilized.\" The Paleo diet was first proposed by Emory University professor Boyd Eaton in a 1987 New England Journal of Medicine paper. It then gained steam from Colorado State professor Loren Cordain's 2002 book, \"The Paleo Diet.\" Both authors argued that by eating the way hunter-gathers did -- no rice, bread, potatoes, or soda -- Americans can prevent heart disease, diabetes, obesity and many other ailments. No one can say exactly why the diet has spiked in popularity recently, but internet searches of the phrase \"Paleo Diet\" have increased tenfold since 2007 and doubled in 2010, according to Google. Many link the rise in interest to the explosion of more than 1,200 Crossfit gyms across the country advocating the diet. \"Modern diets are ill suited for our genetic composition,\" states Crossfit.com. \"Evolution has not kept pace with advances in agriculture and food processing resulting in a plague of health problems for modern man.\" Going Paleo For Pierce, a typical day includes eggs or \"Paleo Pancakes\" for breakfast, turkey chili and salad for lunch, and a dinner of meat, such as salmon or steak, with a side of broccoli and almonds. (See sidebar for some of her favorite recipes.) \"Once you cut out all the preservatives and sweeteners, things like lettuce start to taste a lot better,\" she says. But it's not so easy to make the switch. Jennifer Wilson, 27, an IT specialist from Cockeysville, has been eating Paleo for three months. She says the first two weeks were like quitting a drug. \"You really realize that grains and sugars are an addiction,\" she says. \"You get withdrawal symptoms. After about the second week, you kind of realize, this isn't tough. You lose all the desire to eat sugary stuff and when I did eat it [on a cheat day] it made me feel nauseous. Wilson describes herself as \"fairly in shape\" but still lost weight quickly after going Paleo. \"I lost inches \u2014 and I mean inches \u2014 off of everything,\" she says. \"Off my waist, off my arms, off my thighs. I went down two sizes in a month. My energy level is so consistent throughout the day. I don't get crashes anymore after meals. I used to get horrible migraines and I don't get them any more. It fixed many of my aches and pains. It's not the cure all for everything, but it's worked for general hormonal stuff.\" Skeptical inquiry Not everyone is convinced. Dr. Naheed Ali, author of \"Diabetes and You: A Comprehensive, Holistic Approach,\" says the Paleo diet is \"logical, but impossible.\" \"We live in a society that's jam-packed with fast food ... so our eating habits are more likely to be successful if we concentrate on the good aspects of modernized health,\" he says. \"The last time I checked, we haven't reverted back to being Neanderthals.\" And, Dr. Janet Brill, author of \"Cholesterol DOWN,\" agrees, calling the caveman diet \"just one more low carb fad diet to add to the heap of ineffective self-help diet books.\" \"While eating less processed foods and consuming more whole, unrefined foods is a smart nutrition strategy, any diet that makes legumes and grains \u2014 Mother Nature's gift of health to humankind \u2014 off-limits is pure rubbish,\" she says. \"There is no magic in the dietary advice. A calorie is a calorie no matter how you package it \u2014 eat less and you lose weight. High-protein, low-calorie diets are not nutritionally balanced and do not promote long-term health. You will lose weight but will eventually end up right back where you started, so why bother?\" Michael Murphy, 46, federal government employee from Lutherville who organized his gym's Paleo competition, says the diet is anything but a low-carb fad. \"If you want more carbs eat more fruit and vegetables,\" he says. As for it being \"impossible,\" Murphy acknowledges that's the tough part. It can be socially awkward to have a diet so drastically different from other Americans', and it takes planning to stick to it. \"The key to Paleo is to absolutely plan in advance,\" says Murphy, who will often make a week's worth of food, bringing it to his work's refrigerator. \"If you get hungry and you don't have your Paleo food around, it's much easier to cheat.\" Some Paleo dieters say they strictly abide by the diet's rules. Others include dairy products. Still others, such as Grenier, take it a step further and eat only grass-fed animals. The key is listening to your body and finding out what works for you, Murphy says. \"It's going to be a little different for everybody,\" Murphy says. \"It really is about making it your own.\" Luke Broadwater is managing editor of b.

Donna Pierce, co-owner of Arsenal Fitness in Baltimore, gave us some of her favorite Paleo-friendly recipes. Breakfast: Paleo Pancakes: 1 Banana mashed 1 egg 1.5 tablespoons ground flaxseed 2 tablespoons raw almond butter Mix well in a bowl, then pour the batter into a skillet with coconut oil and cook for about 1 minute on each side. Lunch or Dinner: Paleo Spaghetti For sauce: 1 lb ground turkey 1 large can of tomato paste (look for can where ingredients are tomatoes only) 2 cans of water 1 cup mushrooms 1 clove of minced garlic 1-2 tablespoons oregano 1-2 tablespoons basil In a large pan, heat oil and add onions, garlic and turkey. Cook until meat turns brown. Add remaining ingredients, bring to a simmer and cook 35 minutes, stirring occasionally. While the sauce is simmering, cut a spaghetti squash in half. Place cut side up, covered with plastic wrap in a microwave safe dish for 10 minutes. Remove from microwave and let sit, covered for at least 5 minutes. Scrape out squash to a plate and cover with sauce. Dinner: Chicken a la Greque 1 chicken (3 pounds), cut up 2 Tbsp lemon juice 1 tbsp dried oregano 1/4 tsp. pepper 1/4 cup olive oil Preheat oven to 400F. Combine oregano and pepper in a small dish. Rub seasonings into chicken. Arrange in a 13 x 9 x 2 inch baking dish. Blend together olive oil and lemon juice. Pour over chicken pieces. Bake 40 minutes, until tender. Stuffed Sweet Acorn Squash 1 acorn squash 1 pound grass-fed, organic ground beef (ground turkey also works) 1 chopped onion 1 finely chopped apple 1/2 cup cranberries 1/4 cup chopped raw pecans 1 teaspoon thyme 1 teaspoon oregano 1/2 teaspoon sage coconut oil sea salt, pepper Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Cut the acorn squash in half and scoop out the seeds. Place the squash cut side up in a large baking pan and put a tablespoon of water into each \"cup\" and pour 1/4 cup of water into the bottom of the pan. Loosely \"tent\" the pan with aluminum foil and bake for 30-35 minutes. While squash is baking, chop the onion, apple, pecans and cranberries. Saute the beef and onion in a little coconut oil for 2-3 minutes, then add pecans, cranberries, and herbs. Add sea salt and pepper. Do not completely cook this mixture. Pull squash out of the oven, spoon the mixture into the \"cups\" (heaped to overflowing is okay). Bake uncovered for another 15-20 minutes. Dessert: Fudge Babies: 1 1/3 cup of pitted dates (packed) 1 cup of walnuts (you can also use almonds if you have those instead) 3-4 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Place ingredients in the food processor and pulse til they're all chopped up. Then you roll them into balls in your hands. You'll have to mush them together a bit - once they're chopped up, they're crumbly. Use the heat of your hands to get them to come together. "}
