T errie B. Lee, RN, MS, MPH, CIC, Ona G. Montgomery, RN, MSHA, CIC, James Marx, RN, MS, CIC, Russell N. Olmsted, MPH, CIC, and William E. Scheckler, MD Surveillance in public health is dened as ''the on- going, systematic collection, analysis, interpretation,and dissemination of data regarding a health-relatedevent for use in public health action to reduce morbid-ity and mortality and to improve health. '' 1Infection control professionals apply this denition to both re-duce and prevent health care-associated infections (HAIs) and enhance patient safety. Surveillance, as part of infection prevention and control programs inhealth care facilities, contributes to meeting the pro-gram's overall goals, namely: (1) protect the patient;(2) protect the health care worker, visitors, and othersin the health care environment; and (3) accomplishthe previous two goals in a timely, efcient, and cost-effective manner whenever possible. 2,3 The APIC rst published its Recommended Practices for Surveillance in June 1998.4This revision includes updates related to changing technology and methodol-ogies, as well as new online resources. Demonstrationof quality health care includes documentation of out-comes of care. Surveillance is a comprehensive methodof measuring outcomes and related processes of care,analyzing the data, and providing information to mem- bers of the health care team to assist in improving those outcomes. Surveillance is an essential compo-nent of effective clinical programs designed to reducethe frequency of adverse events such as infection or injury. Although the goal of contemporary infectionprevention and control programs is to eliminate HAIs,epidemiologic surveillance is still required for accuratequantication of events and demonstration of perfor-mance improvement. Although there is no single or ''right'' method of sur- veillance design or implementation, sound epidemio- logic principles must form the foundation of effectivesystems and be understood by key participants in thesurveillance program and supported by senior man-agement. T eamwork and collaboration across thehealth care spectrum are important for the develop-ment of surveillance plans. Rather than institute a''one size ts all'' approach to surveillance, each health care organization must tailor its surveillance systems to maximize resources by focusing on population charac-teristics, outcome priorities, and organizational objec-tives. T o ensure quality of surveillance, the followingelements must be incorporated: a. A written plan should serve as the foundation of any surveillance program. The plan should outline impor-tant goals, objectives, and elements of the surveillanceprocess so that resources can be targeted appropri-ately. This is commonly integrated into a comprehen-sive infection control risk assessment process. b. Thoroughness or intensity of surveillance for an area of interest must be maintained at the same level over time. Fluctuations of a surveillance rate have no meaning unless the same level of data collection ismaintained. External rate comparisons are not help-ful and potentially misleading unless the systemsused have comparable intensity. c. All the elements of surveillance should be used with consistency over time; this includes applica-tion of surveillance denitions and rate calculation methods.

Personnel resources need to be appropriate for the type of surveillance being performed; this includestrained professionals who understand epidemiology and surveillance and who have access to continuing professional education opportunities. e. Other resources essential to surveillance include computer support, information and technologyservices, clerical services, and administrative under-standing and support to maintain a quality program.The use of special infection control software, or self-formatted spreadsheets or databases can greatly facilitate many aspects of the surveillance process, including compiling and management of data, statis-tical analysis (eg, trend and comparative analysis,stratication, signicance testing), graphical presen-tation, and report generation. f. The surveillance program (including surveillance processes and data), as part of the overall infectionprevention and control program, should be evaluated at least annually. Evaluation methods may include qualitative assessments, but should also be based onquantitative changes (eg, improvements or decline inrates). Discontinuing surveillance of outcomes and/orprocesses that have remained stable and essentiallyunchanged over time should be considered to allocateresources to address risks with higher priority. This document is intended to assist professionals who plan and conduct surveillance programs as well as thosewho assure that there is appropriate organizational sup-port to accomplish appropriate surveillance. Althoughdesign of surveillance systems must be unique for eachorganization, incorporation of these seven core Recom-mended Practices for Surveillance provides a scienticframework to approach surveillance programs. In addi- tion, expertise in surveillance methodologies will assist the infection prevention and control professionalwhen addressing issues related to systems that performinter-facility comparisons. (eg, public reporting of healthcare outcomes or other aggregate databases.) The purpose of this document is to provide a frame- work for the development of epidemiologic-based sur-veillance systems for use in health care settings; it is not intended as an independent educational or training document. The following recommendations are basedon a synthesis of current experience and knowledgeof surveillance, as well as publications in peer-reviewedjournals. Surveillance planning may not always proceed in the sequential order presented here. However, organi-zations should ensure that all of the following practices are incorporated into each surveillance plan. These Recommended Practices for Surveillance have beenmost thoroughly applied to HAIs, but they are appropri-ate for any health care outcome or process.RECOMMENDED PRACTICE I Assessing the population Each organization serves different types of patients who are at varied risks for health outcomes (bothnegative and positive). Development of surveillancesystems should be based on evaluation of the popula- tions of interest. Such a risk assessment is critical so that resources can be targeted at populations who areat risk for the outcomes of greatest importance. This,in turn, enables clinicians to use surveillance informa-tion to enhance and improve care provided to thosetargeted populations. Practical applications 1. Obtain information to describe and understand pop- ulation characteristics. The following questions may assist in the assessment of a patient population: dWhat types of patients do we serve? dWhat are the most common diagnoses? dWhat are our most frequently performed surgicalor other invasive procedures? dWhich services or treatments are used most frequently? dAre there services or treatments that increase riskof infection for the patient? dWhat types of patients increase liability and/orcosts for the organization? dDoes the organization's strategic plan focus on particular groups of patients? dWhat types of health concerns exist in the com- munity, region, or regulatory environment? dWhich patients are at increased risk for infectionor other important outcome? Though not addressed here, a general knowledge of risk factors for infection and other outcomes is essential.Such information should be obtained from the literatureand other training sources. Similar assessment questionsshould be forumulated for surveillance of other organi-zational subpopulations such as health care workers. 2. As appropriate, use organization-specic sources to obtain population information. Sources mightinclude the following: dMedical records dFinancial health reports dCommunity agencies dOccupational/employee health428 Vol. 35 No. 7 Lee et al dHuman resources records dMarketing reports 3. Conduct population risk assessment in conjunction with selecting the outcome or process (see ''Selectingthe outcome or process for surveillance'' sectionbelow) to establish priorities for surveillance. Examples 1. Hospital A is a 1500-bed tertiary care medical center offering a wide range of inpatient and outpatientservices. There are six critical care units (medical,surgical, coronary, neurosurgical, pediatrics, and ne-onatal). The open heart surgery program is one of the largest in the country. There is a large orthopedic surgery program and a predominant gynecologyservice as well. An analysis of surgical proceduresdata from the operating room database reveals thatcoronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedures, or-thopedic joint replacements, and hysterectomies areamong the most commonly performed surgical pro-cedures. Outpatient medical records indicate that primary care is available in the clinic setting, with large numbers of participants in both the pediatricsand geriatrics populations. 2. Hospital B is a 75-bed acute care hospital in a rural setting. Medical records show that most admissionsare adult patients with a variety of acute medical di-agnoses. General surgical procedures are performedby the two staff surgeons, with cholecystectomies, hysterectomies, and hernia repairs the most fre- quently performed. Some nursing personnel havereported that many patients may have had indwell-ing urinary catheters longer than necessary or with-out a clear indication for use. One health problemnoted by the local public health department is a re-cent increase in the incidence of tuberculosis (TB). 3. A home health agency provides care to a wide range of patients, specializing in intravascular access/treat- ment with short-term and long-term central linesand with peripheral lines. There is also a large num-ber of patients with indwelling urinary catheters. RECOMMENDED PRACTICE II Selecting the outcome or process for surveillance An organization would rarely nd it feasible to con- duct organization-wide surveillance for all events. A log- ical method for setting surveillance priorities and associated resource allocation is essential. The choiceof outcomes or processes to be measured denes thesurveillance that is appropriate for each measure. Anoutcome is the result of care or performance. Outcomesmay be negative (eg, infection, injury, increased lengthof stay) or positive (eg, patient satisfaction). A process is the series of steps taken to achieve an outcome (eg, im-munization, use of patient restraints, compliance with policies associated with a given outcome). Outcomes and processes included in a surveillance plan shouldbe those that have the most important relevance to thepopulation served. This selection process should occurin conjunction with population assessment (see ''As-sessing the population'' section above). Decisions maybe based on morbidity, mortality, cost, or other parame-ters. Legislative, regulatory, or accrediting organizations as well as corporate or network entities may have addi- tional requirements for surveillance activities that mayaffect the relative priority of surveillance objectives. Practical applications 1. Select outcomes or associated processes for surveil- lance based on organizational and patient popula-tion risk assessment. Consider the following: dRelative frequency of the event dCost or impact of the negative outcome, such astreatment costs, length of stay, functional status,quality of life, mortality, severity measures, and lit-igation and/or public relations risks dPotential for surveillance information to contrib-ute to prevention activities dCustomer needs (eg, priorities set by the health care team) dCommunity served (eg, health needs of the patient population) dOrganizational mission and strategic goals dStrength of association between process andimportant outcome dMicrobiology data and/or antimicrobial usendings dRegulatory or accrediting body requirements 2. Allocate surveillance resources by directing them toward highest ranked priorities. 3. Re-evaluate resulting surveillance objectives as needed, at least annually. Examples 1. The following infection surveillance is planned for a calendar year at Hospital A (see Example 1 in''Assessing the population'' section above): dAll patients in the intensive care unit will be moni-tored for two types of device- associated infec-tions, APs),and central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs). Rationale: high-risk patients, substantial opportunity for improvement, can compare withrates most recently reported by the National Noso-comial Infections Surveillance/National Healthcare Lee et al September 2007 429Safety Network (NNIS/NHSN) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). dAdherence by personnel with ''bundles'' (groups of evidence-based interventions) for prevention of V APs and CLABSIs will be monitored. Rationale:processes that are associated with prevention ofinfectious outcomes. dSurgical site infection (SSI) surveillance will beperformed on the three most common types ofsurgical procedures: CABG, orthopedic joint replace-ments, and hysterectomies. Rationale: CABG: high- risk patients, potential for serious adverse outcomes, frequently occurring procedure, risk managementconcerns; joint replacements: same rationale; hys-terectomies: frequently occurring procedure. Ratesfor comparison are available from NHSN. Also,nurses have reported a perception that there havebeen numerous surgical site infections in patientsundergoing hysterectomy. dAntibiotic prophylaxis will be monitored as a pro-cess measure among the same surgical popula-tions, with a focus on antibiotic delivery timing.Rationale: process known to be associated withpreventing the outcome of SSI. dImmunization rates will be monitored in the inpa-tient settings and outpatient medical and pediatricsclinics. For pediatrics, state-required childhood im- munizations will be included. For adults, the focus will be on influenza and pneumococcus vaccina-tions among high-risk populations. Rationale: pro-cess that is known to prevent serious infections,required information for primary care monitoringas well as a quality indicator for the Centers forMedicare and Medicaid Services. 2. The annual infection surveillance plan for Hospital B (see Example 2 in ''Assessing the population'' sec- tion above) will include the following components: dSSI surveillance will be performed for cholecys- tectomies, hysterectomies, and hernia repairs.Because the number of procedures is so low, ratecalculations may be needed only annually orperhaps less frequently. Although the infection control professional (ICP) will keep aware of SSIs, there is no plan to calculate infection rates forother types of infections, because infectionsoccur too infrequently and the numbers are toosmall to be meaningful. Rationale: focus on themost frequent surgical procedures, can comparerates to those reported by CDC's NNIS/NHSNsystem. dTB skin-testing compliance rates will be moni-tored among all staff, as well as among patientsin high-risk populations. Skin test conversion rateswill also be followed among staff. Rationale:increased prevalence of TB in community, oppor- tunity for early detection and intervention. dUse of indwelling urinary catheters will be moni- tored among patients. Rationale: process asso- ciated with infectious outcome. dImmunization of appropriate patient care person-nel for hepatitis B will be monitored, as will annualinfluenza vaccination participation rate. Rationale:processes known to prevent serious infections. 3. A home health company (see Example 3 in ''Assess- ing the population'' section above) decides to includethree types of device-associated infections in theannual surveillance plan: central line-associatedbloodstream infections, peripheral line-associated bloodstream infections, and catheter-associated urinary tract infections. Patients with intravasculardevices will also be monitored for development ofphlebitis. Rationale: potential for improvement ofhigh-risk device-related outcomes. RECOMMENDED PRACTICE III Using surveillance denitions In any surveillance system, all data elements should be clearly dened. This includes the outcome or pro-cess,''at-risk'' population, and risk factors. Valid deni-tions will enhance consistency, accuracy, andreproducibility of surveillance information. Practical applications 1. Use standardized written case denitions to ensure precise surveillance. Where available and applicable,use previously published, validated denitions.These may be obtained from federal agencies, regu-latory bodies, and professional organizations. Wherenot available, prepare written denitions to ensureintra-organization standardization. For accurate and valid comparisons of data, use the same denitions over time. 2. When historical data are used for internal compari- sons or for external comparisons, ensure that thesame denitions are used for outcomes and pro-cesses and that populations are at similar risk. 3. If denitions are changed, be aware that such changes compromise the comparability of rates over time. This information should be highlighted when reporting data to avoid misinterpretation. Examples 1. The ICP at an acute care hospital decides to conduct surveillance for primary bloodstream infections as-sociated with the use of central lines in the surgicalintensive care unit (SICU) patients. T o be able to430 Vol. 35 No. 7 Lee et al compare ndings to the most recent CDC NHSN data, she uses the CDC case denition5,6for primary bloodstream infections. Patients eligible for this sur- veillance are dened as adult patients in the SICU with one or more central intravascular catheters. 2. The ICP at a long-term acute care (LTAC) facility decides to conduct surveillance for primary blood-stream infections associated with the use of centrallines in the population they serve. Eligible patientsfor this surveillance are dened as those admittedto the LTAC with a central intravascular catheter. She uses the published long-term care denitions 7 for primary blood infections. 3. The risk manager of a large corporate health net- work wants to conduct surveillance for ''preventableaccidents due to unsafe conditions'' at 40 company-owned ambulatory care clinics. He nds that thereare no published denitions for accidents. He de-cides to restrict monitoring to include only falls and automobile collisions. He writes case denitions for use in all facilities as follows: dA fall is dened as a sudden, unexpected change in position in which a person comes to rest uninten- tionally on the floor and/or on some object, whichoccurs on corporate property. Falls will include in-cidents in which the person is found lying on thefloor and/or on some object and is unable to ac-count for his or her position. Falls will not includeincidents in which a patient is eased to the floor bysomeone who had been assisting the patient. Falls will be divided into three categories, depending on severity: (1) no visible or apparent injury; (2)minor injury, including pain or bruising; or (3)serious injury requiring follow-up x-ray lms,sutures, or immediate medical evaluation. dAn automobile collision is dened as any automo-bile colliding with another car, pedestrian, cyclist,or permanent structure, on or within a 50-foot ra- dius of the property. The surveillance denitions will be applied to all oc- currences among clinic patients, visitors, employees,or volunteers in the network. 4. The National Clinical Services Manager of a dialysis center network wishes to compare infection ratesbetween their 23 centers as well as to an external da-tabase. The company's Infection Control consultantrecommends collecting data consistent with the Di-alysis Incident Event component of the NHSN PatientSafety Component Protocol. Local access infectionwas dened as: pus, redness, or swelling of the vas- cular access site and access-associated bacteremia was not present and patient was hospitalized orhad initiation of an intravenous antimicrobial agent.Access-associated bacteremia was bloodculture positive with source identied as the vascu- lar access site or unknown. Patient-months was se-lected as the denominator. The number of chronic hemodialysis patients with each access type who re- ceived hemodialysis at the center during the rst twoworking days of the month was used to estimate thenumber of patient-months. A worksheet with all thedened components was completed by the qualitymanagement coordinator at each site for cases meet-ing infection criteria. The respective center's datamanagement clerk was responsible to tabulate dial- ysis days and compute estimated patient-months. RECOMMENDED PRACTICE IV Collecting surveillance data The process of collecting surveillance data should be managed by knowledgeable professionals qualiedby training and experience. Surveillance personnel re-quire access to appropriate information sources to con-sistently apply methods and thoroughly record data. Practical applications 1. Train personnel and others in data collection methods specic to each surveillance objective.Data collectors can include infection control or other professionals as well as staff with interest or participation responsibilities. Whenever possi-ble, oversight of the surveillance program shouldbe by an ICP who is certied in infection controland epidemiology (CIC). 8 2. Collaborate with available information technology resources to support surveillance activities andconsider performing data collection off-site, when knowledgeable infection control personnel are not available on-site. 3. Develop the data collection tool to t a given surveil- lance objective, and after the necessary data ele-ments are determined. Limit collection to what isneeded for the specic surveillance objective. Formsfor data collection could include intranet-based,computerized data entry screens, handheld personal digital assistant devices, and/or paper forms. 4. Consider commercially available software to lter large amounts of data to improve productivity ofpersonnel. Access to a broad range of informationsuch as patient clinical data, pharmacy, radiology,and laboratory is increasingly becoming availableelectronically in many health settings and can en-hance the efciency of surveillance. 5. Support and be involved in efforts to introduce and maintain an electronic health record (EHR). Partic-ipate in planning the development of automatedand semi-automated reports, to ensure that key Lee et al September 2007 431data elements are captured and retrievable for epi- demiologically meaningful analysis (eg, devicedays for calculation of device-associated infection incidence density rate). 6. Be aware that passively obtained data may be biased (eg, incomplete because of underreporting). Care-fully analyze and interpret data that are exclusivelyderived through passive surveillance, where reportsare initiated by the caregivers and must be promp-ted by recognition of the need to report the occur-rence of an event (eg, reporting of medication errors, patient falls, occupational injuries). 7. Determine the appropriate approach to surveil- lance (ie, concurrent [prospective] and/or retro-spective, depending on the issue being surveyedand available resources). Concurrent surveillanceis initiated when the patient is still under the careof the organization. Advantages include the abilityto capture the information in real time, interview the patient's caregivers, and interactively obtain or observe ndings that may not be recorded inthe patient record. Concurrent surveillance maybe more costly and may have limited sensitivity ifthere is delay in completion of the patient record,such as with late laboratory results. These datamay be incomplete. Retrospective surveillance in-volves primarily closed record review and the ex- amination of information after the patient has been discharged or is no longer under the care ofthe organization. Although it does not permit inter-actions with ongoing caregivers, it allows for acomprehensive review of sequential events in theclosed record and avoids the often time-consumingefforts of locating and reviewing charts in busy pa-tient care areas. This efciency associated with ret- rospective review is especially attractive if there is little opportunity or need for intervention. Considerthe impact of delays in the coding process whencollecting data that rely on coding, such as ICD-9. 8. Avoid singular reliance on ''easily retrievable'' data such as that derived from administrative datasetslike abstracted billing information. There is grow-ing evidence that such use signicantly compro- mises the quality and accuracy of these for surveillance of HAIs. 9-12Administrative data may be useful for identifying possible HAIs, but theyare not reliable or valid for epidemiologic purposes. 9. Incorporate postdischarge surveillance for certain outcomes, particularly when important informationmay become apparent after the patient leaves thehealth care organization (eg, surgical site infections, certain adverse drug reactions). If included, the strat- egy for postdischarge surveillance should be clearlyoutlined in the surveillance plan. Note, becausethere remains no consensus on efcacy or validityof various postdischarge surveillance methods, data derived from this component should be identi-ed with appropriate notation should there be pres- sure for inter-facility comparison of performance. 10. Collect data from a variety of sources. Use informa- tion technology resources where available. risk management) dAdmission diagnoses reports dSurgical schedule/databases 11. Consider the development of standardized training methods forstaff involved in data collection. Trainingfor those merely responsible for denominator collec-tion might be as simple as one-to-one instruction or review in a staff meeting. For staff responsible to ap- ply infection surveillance denitions, or perform de-tailed risk factor collection, more formal education isindicated. In-person workshop-type training withpractice cases to classify and receive feedback couldbe presented. Other approaches particularly usefulfor multiple or remote geographic locations mightinclude self-study modules with practice cases, Web-based sessions, or conference calls. Examples 1. An acute care hospital is conducting surveillance for device-associated infection rates and device utiliza- tion ratios in its SICU. The team meets to develop the surveillance plan. The ICP will monitor and col-lect data for primary bloodstream infections associ-ated with central lines and VAPs. The respiratorytherapy department will use its automated databaseto generate the number of SICU patients on a ventila-tor at the same designated time each day. The SICUnursing staff will collect and record the number of patients with a central line each day. The Patient Accounts representative will provide the count of pa-tient days (data already collected for other purposes). 2. Because urinary tract infections are associated with the use of indwelling catheters, a home healthagency has decided to conduct process surveillanceof appropriateness of catheter usage. Data collectionwill be limited to the rst month of admission for each new patient. Nurses gather the data regarding patients with catheters and approved indicationsfor catheter use during their visits. 3. A freestanding ambulatory and short-stay surgical hospital, identies selected operations for activesurveillance of SSI. The ICP collects elements432 Vol. 35 No. 7 Lee et al necessary for risk stratication from review of oper- ative records every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.Educational programs on the importance of postdi-scharge infection reporting and on the CDC NHSNdenitions of SSI are conducted for the surgeons, clin-ical, and ofce staff. Additionally, the ICP offers tele-phone courtesy consultations on infection controlissues to physicians' ofces. Each month, a question- naire is sent to designated contact persons in each surgeon's ofce. Included in the mailing is a list of pa-tients who underwent the selected operations, datesof surgery, and a request to provide date of postoper-ative visit and to identify whether or not an infectionwas present. A return envelope is included. The ICPalso makes brief telephone calls to the ofces on a ro-tating schedule to assure SSI reporting is still in pro- cess and to check on other infection control needs. 4. An acute care hospital has implemented an elec- tronic health record. Information T echnology hasbuilt reports for the Infection Prevention and Con-trol Department. Data on central line days in the in-tensive care unit are now fully automated and canbe requested on demand for any time period. Micro-biology reports are processed through a commer- cially available software program that combs through the laboratory information system. TheICP evaluates the information to conrm that thepositive blood cultures in intensive care patientswith central lines truly meet the most recently pub-lished NHSN denitions of infection. RECOMMENDED PRACTICE V Calculating and analyzing surveillance rates Surveillance information is usually expressed in numerical measurements of the outcome or processbeing observed. Ratios, proportions, and rates ( Box 1 ) are frequently used for these expressions, althoughthey are commonly (and hereafter in this document)generically referred to as ''rates. ''It is essential that appropriate calculations be per- formed and reported with a consistency of methodol-ogy over time for interpretation of each surveillancecomponent. Consistency includes the concept of thor-oughness of case nding (surveillance intensity) andaccuracy of the case and population denitions. Analy-sis and comparison of rates within an institution overtime and across institutions also require that all aspects of surveillance be equivalent. Practical applications 1. T o optimally support the surveillance process, iden- tify appropriate and feasible types of rates for asurveillance component prior to data collection. 2. Recognize that rates (rates, ratios, and proportions) are fractions. The numerator is the event of interest. The denominator is a measurement of the popula-tion in which the event may occur. 3. Present rates in a manner that is understandable to those who need to use the information. 4. Be aware that a rate can be accurate and consistent but still not useful or interpretable if the numeratoris too small (infrequent event) or the denominator is of inappropriate size (usually too small). In some in- stances, less frequent calculation of rates may allowfor accumulation of sufcient numbers. 5. Use statistical probability methods to determine whetherapparent differences in rates are meaningful. Examples See examples in ''Applying risk stratication metho- dology'' section below.Box 1. T erms of numerical measurement Ratio A general term, obtained by dividing one number by another. The numerator and denominator do not have to be related. Proportion A ratio in which the numerator must be included in the denominator. Often expressed as a percentage. The numerator represents a part of the whole (the denominator). Rate A ratio with a particular relationship between the numerator and the denominator, where the denominator includes time measurement. T erm often loosely applied generically to all numerical measurements. Crude rate Overall rate for an entire population or organization. Difcult to interpret because of the likely differences between subgroups in the overall population. Category-specic rate A rate calculated for a subpopulation so that comparisons will be possible.Incidence A proportion. A measurement of new cases of disease within a population over a given period. The numerator is the number of new cases of the event being measured and the denominator is the initial population eligible or ''at risk'' to develop the condition or event. Also known as cumulative incidence. Incidence density Also known as incident rate. Uses a denominator of person-time units. or time units of exposure to account for variation in the periods that each person is at risk for the event being measured (numerator). Prevalence A type of proportion; a measurement of existing cases of disease within a population over a given period of time. Table 1.

Compliance with group of validated care processes known to prevent infection (ie, ''bundle'') (propor- tion) ( Ta b l e 6 ). 5. Patients with indwelling urinary catheters in whom there is an appropriate indication for presence ofthe device (proportion) ( Ta b l e 7 ). RECOMMENDED PRACTICE VI Applying risk stratication methodology Within a population under study, there is frequently lack of homogeneity. This may be from differences inage, sex, severity of underlying illnesses, or other fac-tors. Such differences require that the population besubdivided into groups with like characteristics. Thisadjustment is usually called stratication. Without strat- ication, internal comparisons of rates over time or ex-ternal comparisons are likely to be invalid or misleading. Practical applications 1. Apply risk stratication methods to achieve the following: dAllow meaningful and accurate comparisons to be made. dFoster understanding and acceptance by recipi- ents of the data. dFacilitate utility and validity of interventions. 2. Determine current availability of risk stratication methods. dDetermine to what extent the methods have been validated. dAscertain if relevant stratication methods are rec- ommended by key organizations (eg, a compositerisk score for surgical site infections used forNHSN or a severity of illness index). dIf no validated methods are available for analysisand interpretation, obtain epidemiologic and/orbiostatistical assistance. For some rates, risk strat- ication may not be possible. 3. If rates are stratied, assure that subpopulation sizes are large enough to be statistically meaningful.

A large ambulatory primary care clinic system serv- ing adults and children chooses adult immunizationrates as a performance improvement (PI) focus forthe year. The quality manager decides to stratify bypayor source because there is considerable variabil-ity in coverage for such prevention services ( T able 8 ). 2. The neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) collaborative practice committee denes CLABSIs as a new surveil- lance objective. Rationale: high risk, high volume, and perceived substantial opportunity for improvement. The following steps were developed by the collabo- rative practice group: dNICU health unit coordinator to develop simpleform with all infants by birthweight category, and print updated list daily. dNursing staff to note on form which infants have central lines at 7 AMdaily. dHealth unit coordinator adds daily line days formonth's total and forwards to the epidemiologyofce.dEpidemiology staff is responsible to apply age-spe-cic criteria for nosocomial BSI using CDC's NHSNdenitions based on chart review and interviewswith neonatologists. dEpidemiology staff enters cases and line daycounts into database. dAfter assessing population size and the frequency ofcentral line utilization, tentative plans are made to calculate and report device-specic incidence den- sity rates and device utilization ratios every 6 months. dData reported from NHSN will be used forcomparison.

The ICP reviews published literature and recommendsimplementing a procedure-specic, multivariate riskindex as used in the CDC NNIS/NHSN system. After 6 months of data collection and stratication by this new method, the ICP presents data showingthat the CDC SSI risk index is substantially more pre-dictive of SSI than wound class alone. Note: The following two examples are provided as examples only and do not represent validated strat-ication systems. They are included for illustrativepurposes only. For some measurements there maybe no known or validated stratication models. 5. A long-term care facility serves a variable popula- tion including ambulatory elderly, persons with Alz-heimer's disease, and persons with neuromuscular disorders. The quality manager uses a weighted scoring system for fall injury risk. Variable pointsare given for risk factors such as age, hemiplegia,and history of previous falls. The score is assigneddaily. In addition to utilizing the index for preven-tion actions, it was decided to calculate fall ratesby three risk categories ( T able 12 ).6. A subacute and rehabilitation facility serving popu- lations such as patients with spinal cord injuries orhead injuries and patients who have had strokesuses a scale for assessing pressure ulcer risk. Risk factors are counted and a risk score assigned daily to each patient. Scores based on ve parametersare totaled and can range from 5 (lowest risk) to20 (highest risk). The care assessment and planningcouncil decided to use a simple two-level stratica-tion system for rate calculations ( T able 13 ). RECOMMENDED PRACTICE VII Reporting and using surveillance information The demonstrable power of surveillance is in sharing ndings with those who need to know and who can act on these ndings to improve patient safety . Numerous ex- amples in the scientic literature illustrate that height-ened awareness by personnel of results of process andoutcome monitoring signicantly improves perfor-mance. 13-19A plan for the distribution of surveillance in- formation should be incorporated into the developmentof each surveillance component.

Report-i n gs h o u l db ed o n ei nas y s t e m a t i co n g o i n gb a s i st oe n -sure that information sharing is timely. Practical applications 1. Design each surveillance report to be user-friendly as well as to provide accurate, interpretable information. 2. Ensure that clinicians and persons trained in epide- miology or data methodology collaborate in the in- terpretation of surveillance data. 3. Use caution when submitting and/or interpreting surveillance data used for external or inter-facilitycomparisons. Comparisons are valid only if all con-tributors to the data have: dused the same surveillance intensity dused similar data collection methods dapplied the same surveillance denitions daddressed differences in populations/case mix dstratied data as appropriate 4. Report surveillance information in a manner to stimulate improvement of the process or outcomebeing measured. This can be incorporated into for-mal or informal organizational performance im-provement efforts. Visual displays using charts,graphs, tables, or other graphics tools may be ex-tremely useful in outlining surveillance data. Examples 1. The medical director of a freestanding home health agency with a large intravenous (IV) therapy serviceproclaimed to the quality improvement committeethat they had a ''huge'' problem with line-related in-fections and suggested immediate implementationof mandatory education programs for all staff. Theleader of an existing care management team sug- gested contacting the agency's infection controlconsultant about how to approach the concern.The team reviewed the existing data and foundthat although there had been a recent increase inIV-associated infections, the rate per 1000 linedays for the rst 2 quarters of the current year wasnot signicantly different than the previous years' experience. Further evaluation showed that the pro- portion of infections associated with peripherallyinserted central catheter (PICC) lines was substan-tially higher in the current monitoring period. Itwas also found that increasing numbers of familymembers were becoming responsible for the careof the PICC lines. Improvement activities were devel-oped, such as a patient and family teaching module, return demonstrations, a simplied access port sys- tem, and a preassembled catheter care tray. Subse-quent monitoring revealed improvement in theoverall rate of IV-associated infections and a signi-cant reduction in the proportion of infections in cli-ents with PICC lines. The team continued routinesurveillance of IV infections but ultimately reducedthe monitoring of patient/family care processes to random checks after the techniques had been suc- cessfully demonstrated for three successive visits. 2. A chemical dependency unit had a policy to offer TB skin testing to all new clients. A retrospective recordreview showed only 30% were actually tested. Anal-ysis of the initial data by the integrated care coordi-nation team revealed the following: dPoor documentation of which clients were actu-ally eligible (eg, some were prior reactors, somehad recent test results already available). dNo way to determine what percentage were of-fered but declined, rather than never offered be-cause of oversight.Table 13.

Actions taken: the care coordination team revised the intake form to include TB testing data and an area to document refusal or previous positive status.They worked with the local health department toutilize existing educational material and incorpo-rated this into employee orientation and continuingeducation programs, competency checklists, andinto unit orientation for new clients. Remonitoringafter improvement efforts showed an acceptance rate of 90% in eligible clients. 3. An SICU with an active trauma service had partici- pated in central-line bloodstream infection surveil-lance for 12 months. Following rate reporting aftertwo 6-month cycles, a PI team was formed to exam-ine opportunities for improvement because therewas concern that the rate exceeded the CDC NHSN90th percentile in both monitoring periods. The PI team identied two concerns: dFor staff convenience, central lines may remain in place longer than necessary. dPolicies for maximal barrier precautions, for handhygiene, and for change frequency for pulmonaryartery catheters were not routinely followed. The team requested further assistance from the in- fection control specialist serving on the team to de-sign a process surveillance method to evaluatecompliance with insertion guidelines and to calcu-late device utilization ratios for comparison to datareported by the NNIS/NHSN system.Findings: The unit device utilization ratio was very similar to the NHSN 50th percentile, indicating they were probably not over-utilizing central lines.The process monitor of compliance to policiesshowed that fewer than 60% were inserted undermaximal barrier precautions and fewer than 30%of pulmonary artery catheters were changed accord-ing to policy. In addition, hand hygiene was appro-priate in only 30% of patient contacts. The PI team's improvement recommendations cen- tered around re-education of physicians and nurseson the hospital's IV policies, on empowering nursesto stop the central line insertion process if all pre-cautions were not followed, on changing supplyprocesses to ensure all necessary componentswere available to support maximal barrier precau-tions for insertion, and on developing a reminder system for catheter change frequency (implementa- tion and monitoring of central line bundles.) 4. An ICP has been reviewing SSI data with the In- fection Control Committee. A quality team hasbeen formed to address SSI prevention practices.Although the ICP is responsible for infectionmonitoring, the operating room staff assist in pro- cess monitoring. T o provide more meaningful feed-back to clinicians, the ICP creates a letter to send to surgeons and anesthesiologists whenever an infec- tion is detected. The letter will outline which pro-cesses, if any, were not implemented for eachspecic case. Monitored processes will include hairremoval, antibiotic selection, dosing, timing of pro-phylaxis, glucose monitoring, and temperature.After 3 months of providing these letters to theinvolved physicians, infections decreased and a spot check of processes reveals higher compliance rates. CONCLUSION This document has outlined seven Recommended Practices for Surveillance. These practices are necessaryfor the success of a surveillance program in any healthcare setting. A well-implemented surveillance plan will serve a pivotal role in supporting high-quality care ini- tiatives by providing systems for monitoring, measuring,and reporting important outcomes and processes. Asstated by Alexander D. Langmuir, ''Good surveillancedoes not necessarily ensure the making of the right de-cisions, but it reduces the chances of wrong ones.
