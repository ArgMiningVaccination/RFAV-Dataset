Michelle Rudolph, RN, CMSRN Registered NurseUniversity of 3:29:58 PMMedical-surgical nursing is alive and well! Once considered a basic skill required of all nurses, medical-surgical nursing has become increasingly complex, evolving into a vital specialty nursing practice. Medical-surgical nurses must care for a growing number of health care consumers with complex medical needs as well as keep current with continuing developments in health care science, technology, and economics. They must overcome the challenges these developments can bring to providing patient care while continuing to provide high-quality nursing care to diverse patient populations in all stages of life\u2014from adolescents to the elderly. Specialty certi cation is the most important step a registered nurse can take in his or her career. It signi es a nurse's commitment to professional growth and development and, most importantly, to provide safe, effective, timely, and high-quality patient care. Research by the American Board of Nursing Specialties con rms that certi cation vali- dates specialized knowledge, enhances professional credibility and autonomy, indi-cates professional growth, and provides evidence of professional commitment. Lippincott's Review for Medical-Surgical Nursing Certi cation will certainly help you in your pursuit of certi cation as a medical-surgical nurse. This thoroughly updated review book offers the most current content typically included in medical-surgical nursing certi cation tests by both the Medical-Surgical Nursing Certi cation Board (MSNCB) of the Academy of Medical Surgical Nurses (AMSN) and the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC). The core content of this new edition has been attentively revised to refl ect the best available practices that infl uence medical-surgical nursing. It includes review topics on the foundations of nursing, legal and ethical aspects of nursing, principles of medical-surgical nursing and wound care, and disruptions in homeostasis. It also reviews the different body systems and associated diseases that certi cation exams frequently cover\u2014and that medical-surgical nurses commonly encounter. New content includes cultural and ethnic beliefs and practices, evidence-based practice, safety issues, health maintenance and wellness, and lifestyle management. The many new topics covered include collaboration, patient's bill of rights and self-determination, the developmental theories of Jean Piaget and Abraham Maslow, nutri-tion, substance abuse, abuse and neglect, complementary therapies, obesity, herbal remedies, adult immunizations, and laboratory values. Another highlight is the addi-tion of more practice questions with rationales at the end of each chapter. The posttest at the end of the book has also been greatly expanded to ensure your mastery of the content you've covered. Whether you're a newly graduated nurse exploring the specialty of medical- surgical nursing, a displaced nurse reentering the nursing profession, or a seasoned nurse wanting to update your skills and knowledge in medical-surgical nursing or become certi ed in this prestigious specialty, I know you'll nd this book a valuable vForewordForeword Foreword addition to your library. More importantly, this book will give you the knowledge and con dence you need to ace the medical-surgical nursing certi cation exam. I wish you well as you move forward in this major endeavor-becoming certi ed as a medical-surgical nurse. John Allan Menez, RN-BC, MS, CMSRN Faculty, University of Phoenix, Phoenix, Ariz.

Med-Surg_FM.indd 3:29:58 PM1 1Medical-surgical nurses are the backbone of health and wellness care in the United States. Indeed, new nurs- ing graduates are strongly encouraged to work in a hospital as a medical-surgical nurse for 1 to 2 years to hone their skills before branching out into other areas of nursing. In 1972, the American Nurses Association (ANA) recognized this valuable specialty by certifying medical-surgical nurses through the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC)\u2014almost 151,000 nurses have been certi ed to date in more than 30 specialty and advanced practice areas of nursing. Further, as of 1990, a new medical-surgical nursing organization, the Academy of Medical-Surgical Nurses (AMSN), was founded to serve the speci c educational needs of this group of nurses. The AMSN has also developed a certi cation examination to recognize the knowledge base of the practicing medical-surgical nurse. The ANCC certi cation examination The ANA offers two examinations for medical-surgical nursing certi cation: a basic medical-surgical nurse examination and a clinical specialist examination in adult health (formerly medical-surgical nursing). The ANCC administers the computer-based examinations in cities throughout the United States and its territories. The tests last about 4 hours. Eligibility and application The ANCC establishes criteria for eligibility to take the examination. Requirements for the basic examination differ from those of the clinical specialist examination. The criteria discussed in this book were in effect as of the 2010 examination. Because requirements can change, candidates should obtain the latest criteria before applying for certi cation. (See ANCC certi cation eligibility requirements, page 2.) The medical-surgical nursing examination is available to nurses with an associate's degree or diploma, thus establishing two levels of cre-dentialing. Nurses certi ed at the baccalaureate level are designated as Board Certi ed, or \"RN-BC\"; nurses certi ed at the associate or diploma level are designated as Certi ed, or \"RN-C.\" The credential approved for clinical nurse specialists is \"APRN-BC.\" After you have decided to prepare for the examination, obtain the certi cation catalog by writing to the American Nurses Credentialing Center, 8515 Georgia Ave., Suite 400, Silver Spring, MD 20910-3492, or by calling toll-free 1-800-284-2378. This catalog provides all the information you'll need to apply. Examina-tion information, catalogs, and applications may also be obtained through the ANCC Web site at www. nursecredentialing.org . Pay careful attention to all steps in the application process. Failure to complete any step correctly may make you ineligible to take the examination on the date you had planned. All applicants must pay a non-refundable application fee and an examination fee, set each year by the credentialing center.Medical-surgical nursing After establishing your eligibility, the credentialing center will mail you a handbook that contains the current examination blueprint, or test plan. The test plan outlines the test content and the ratio (weighting) of each content area. Information about the test plan, especially its content, can provide considerable guidance in helping you organize your study plan. In the ANCC catalog for 2010, medical-surgical examination topics included biophysical and psychosocial concepts, pathophysiology of body systems, patient care, health promotion and wellness, management and leadership, and legal and ethical issues and trends. Examination topics for the clinical specialist in medical-surgical nursing included clinical practice, consultation, management, education, research, and issues and trends. The Board on Certi cation for Medical-Surgical Nursing Practice, one of the many ANCC certi cation boards, develops the certi cation examination. The test objectively evaluates knowledge, comprehension, and application of medical-surgical nursing theory and practice to patient care. The test development committee de nes the content areas covered in each test and the emphasis placed on each area. Certi ed medical-surgical nurses from around the country contribute questions for each examination. The committee reviews each test item for accuracy, readability, and relevance to the test plan. Sample questions approved by the committee are compiled into an examination that will be used on the next test date. All com-puter-based examinations offer on-site testing results. The certi cate and ANCC pin are mailed about 8 weeks after successful completion of the examination. Each test contains 175 multiple-choice questions. Of those questions, 150 are scored questions and 25 are nonscored, pretest questions. The pretest questions aren't distinguishable from the scored questions. A candi-date's score is based solely on the 150 scored questions. Candidates have 4 hours to complete the test. A break usually is provided.The American Nurses Credentialing Center's (ANCC) eligibility criteria for certi cation in medical-surgical nursing, as of 2010, are listed below. Note that the requirements f or the basic nursing examination differ from those of the specialist examination. Criteria for a medical-surgical nurse (RN-BC: Registered Nurse-Board Certi ed)Criteria for a clinical nurse specialist in adult health (ACNS-BC: Adult Health Clinical Nurse Specialist-Board Certi ed) By the time of application, you must: 1. hold a current, active unrestricted professional registered nurse (RN) license in the United States or its territories or the professional, legally recognized equivalent in another country 2. have practiced the equivalent of 2 years full-time as an RN 3. have practiced as a licensed RN in medical-surgical nursing for a minimum of 2,000 hours within the past 3 years 4. have received 30 contact hours within the last 3 years in medical-surgical nursing. By the time of application, you must: 1. hold a current, active RN license in the United States or its territories or the professional, legally recognized equivalent in another country 2. hold a master's degree or higher in nursing 3. have been prepared in medical-surgical nursing through a master's degree program or a formal postgraduate master's program in nursing 4. have graduated from an accredited institution granting graduate-level academic credit for all of the course work (including advanced health assessment, advanced pharmacology, and advanced pathophysiology) that includes both didactic and clinical components, and a minimum of 500 hours of supervised clinical practice in medical-surgical nursing.

No results are released early or over the telephone to protect the privacy of candidates. The AMSN certi cation examination The AMSN is a professional organization for nurses who practice medical-surgical/adult health care. The organization developed the Scope and Standards of Medical-Surgical Nursing Practice; it builds on the ANA's Standards of Clinical Practice and helps to establish the responsibilities of medical-surgical nurses in all types of health care settings. The AMSN founded the Medical-Surgical Nursing Certi cation Board (MSNCB) to and imple- ment a certi cation examination for medical-surgical nurses. The tests are offered as computer-based exams, available throughout the year, or as paper-and-pencil exams, administered four times a year. The test lasts 4 hours. Eligibility and application The MSNCB establishes criteria for eligibility to take the examination. However, because requirements can change, candidates should obtain the latest criteria before applying for certi cation. (See AMSN certi ca- 4.) The medical-surgical certi cation examination does not require a BSN degree. Nurses who are certi ed through this examination are designated as \"RN-CMSRN.\" MSNCB works with a testing center, the Center for Nursing Education. The certi cation catalog and exam- ination application may be obtained by writing to MSNCB, East Holly Avenue, Box 56, Pitman, NJ 08071. Or download an application from the Web site www.amsn.org . Again, be sure to read all directions, and pay careful attention to all steps in the application process. Fail- ure to complete the application properly may lead to ineligibility to take the examination. Certi cation test plan If the application is completed properly, an examination permit is mailed approximately 2 weeks before the test. The permit will include the test center address and the time you should report to the center. You must have the examination permit to be admitted to take the exam. The paper-and-pencil exam contains 175 questions, including 25 nonscored, pretest questions. The exam must be completed in 4 hours, and results are mailed approximately 8 weeks after the exam. The computer-based exam contains 150 scored questions, with no pretest questions. The test must be com- pleted in 3 hours, and the results are available immediately after the exam is completed. Strategies for a successful certi cation examination When you're ready to take a medical-surgical nursing certi cation examination, you'll need to learn about the certi cation process. Certi cation is a way to validate your knowledge, skills, and abilities as a medical- surgical nurse. The certi cation test is based on predetermined standards, so you should become certi ed in your area of clinical expertise. Start by selecting the organization you want certi cation from. Next, research the requirements for certi- cation. You can begin your research by typing \"medical-surgical certi cation\" into a search engine. Some Web sites you might want to look more closely at include: www.msncb.org and www.nursecredentialing.org . Certifying organizations provide a test content outline, test reference list, and sample tests with practice ques-tions. They typically list review courses with locations and dates as well as test-taking strategy courses. If you must choose only one course, select the review course. You can learn about successful test-taking strategies by reading further. Med-Surg_Chap01.indd to successful certi cation: following a well-thought-out study plan and reviewing diligently, preparing carefully for examination day to avoid unexpected surprises, and learning successful test-taking strategies. Each component calls for a closer look. Following a study plan Successful test preparation calls for a well-thought-out study plan. This book provides you with an organized source for that review; you can also use the test-center content outline to help guide your study plan. Then identify the concepts you nd most dif cult and content where you have a knowledge gap, and place those topics rst on your study outline. Next, divide the study plan into weeks and then subdivide that into days. Divide the topics into study sessions for each day. To help organize your thoughts, make note cards that concisely cover major topics. Be creative with the note cards. Use mnemonic devices to help you recall information you otherwise can't easily remember. Try some brightly colored pens or pencils to help make the cards decorative and visually memorable. Make sure you allow at least a week for each of the major content areas. Then divide each week into a pat- tern of study by days. Study a topic thoroughly on its assigned day of the week, and then reserve a day to take practice exams, using good test-taking strategies. Mark off each topic as you complete it. Use 2 of the last 3 days before the exam to review topics you're still weak on and to take practice exams. When you take practice exams, also practice pacing yourself so that you'll be able to complete the exam. Give yourself about a minute to answer each question; use a stopwatch if necessary. Finally, reserve the day before the exam for rest and relaxation. You may want to try combining study with exercise. For instance, walking while studying can help you to relieve stress, relax, and maintain your physical health. Just remember, if you walk and study, be safe; don't walk on busy streets or use equipment that could lead to an accident. Some certi cation centers offer the choice of taking the test using either paper and pencil or a computer. Make sure you take practice tests using the appropriate method. If you plan to take the test on a computer\u2014the most popular method\u2014then take online practice tests. If you plan to take a paper-and-pencil version of the test, take practice exams using that method. Most medical-surgical certi cation exams range from 3\u00bd to 4 hours. The week before the exam, take a prac- tice test that's the same length as the actual exam, and spend the full 3\u00bd to 4 hours taking the exam. Think of this as pre-examination calisthenics. If you have time, take a full-length exam twice, on separate days. How-ever, don't attempt a practice exam the day before the real exam; you'll tire yourself out unnecessarily.The Academy of Medical-Surgical Nurses (AMSN) eligibility criteria, as of 2010, are listed below. By the time of application you must: hold a current and unrestricted license as a registered nurse (RN) in the United States, or any of its territories OR hold a current, full, unrestricted license to practice as a rst-level nurse in the country in which one's nursing education was completed; and meet the eligibility criteria for licensure as an RN in accordance with requirements of the Commission of Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools (CGFNS) have practiced a minimum of 2 full years as an RN in an adult medical-surgical clinical setting have accrued a minimum of 2,000 hours within the past 3 years of clinical practice in an adult medical-surgical setting.

Available at www.amsn.org.AMSN cation certi cation examination 5 After you've completed the study plan, use the last day for rest, relaxation, and nal last-minute prepa- ration for the test. Eat nutritiously, participate in light exercise, and get plenty of sleep the night before the exam. Preparing for examination day Careful planning can help you avoid unexpected surprises on test day. Make sure you know the exact location of the test center. Drive to the center a few days before the actual test at about the time the test is scheduled. Time the drive so you know how long it will take to arrive. Collect the required identi cation. Most test centers will accept a driver's license, passport, or U.S. military identi cation. Make sure your identi cation is current (not expired), and that your name and address are cor- rect. Test centers may not allow books, calculators, food, drinks, notes, cell phones, or personal electronics; check the test center's rules before you arrive. Also, check to see what is allowed. If the center allows pencils and paper, make sure you bring them with you. The evening before the exam, ll your car's gas tank, lay out your clothes, pack a small bag of peanut-cov- ered chocolate (or another high-energy snack if you're allergic to peanuts) and a bottle of water, and gather together your note cards. Plan to wear layered clothing, shoes with covered toes to prevent cold feet, and gen-erally comfortable attire. On day of the test, arrive 30 minutes ahead of time. Before entering the test site, eat your snack; the pea- nuts will provide long-term energy, the sugar will give you quick energy, and the chocolate will make the neurons in your brain re faster. Then drink enough water to quench your thirst. Next, pull out your note cards one last time and look at them. Don't analyze them or attempt to learn anything in the last minute; just try to see what each card looks like. When you arrive at the center, you'll be checked in to the test site and then admitted to the examination room. Before you enter, take one last bathroom stop. Once you're in the examination room, at the start of the test write down everything you can still \"see\" from your note cards (if you're allowed to have paper and pen-cil in the examination room). Write down everything you can visualize, but don't spend more than 10 min-utes transcribing note cards from memory. Finally, remember that you've studied hard, learned extensively from clinical practice, and prepared well to take the medical-surgical nursing certi cation examination. Have con dence in yourself; you're ready for the test! Learning test-taking strategies You can improve your chances of passing any standardized multiple-choice examination by using proven test-taking techniques. These include knowing how timed examinations are administered, understanding all the parts of a test question, and taking speci c steps to help make sure that you've selected the correct answer. And if you come across a question you absolutely don't know the answer to, you need to know how to make a good guess! Because you aren't penalized for guessing, you should try to respond to every question. Answering other questions may stimulate your recall of the correct answer for a question you've left unanswered. If you still have no idea of a correct answer, certain tricks can give you a greater than 50% chance of guessing accurately. Keep in mind that the people writing questions for certi cation exams are experts in the content area and know test-taking strategies thoroughly, so the following tricks may not always work for you. But generally, you're more likely to guess correctly if you select option B or C. Also, longer answers tend to be correct, and if you come across two similar answers, one of those answers is probably correct. Eliminating at least one answer that you're sure is incorrect will also improve your chances of guessing correctly. And, if all other strategies fail, you still have a one in four chance of guessing correctly. Med-Surg_Chap01.indd 5 Med-Surg_Chap01.indd try out your test-taking strategies, you can take online tests from other disciplines that you know noth- ing about. In such cases, all you have to rely on are good test-taking strategies. If you score at least 60% on such tests, you've mastered those strategies. All questions on a certi cation examination are carefully crafted and pretested to ensure readability and uniformity. Understanding the components of a question can help you analyze what it's asking, increasing the likelihood that you'll respond correctly. (See Parts of a test question .) Time management is crucial when taking a standardized test because you receive no credit for unanswered questions. Because of that, you should try to pace yourself to nish the test on time. Remember, you'll have about a minute to answer each question. Don't spend too much time on any one question. If you're taking a paper-and-pencil exam, place a light pencil mark next to a question you're unsure of and come back later, if time is available. Computer-based exams also allow you to mark questions you're unsure about to return to later if time permits. Make sure you know how to mark questions before starting the test; the proctor can help you if you need assistance. For both computer and paper-and-pencil tests, read every question carefully. If a clinical situation precedes the question, study the information given. Watch for key words (such as most, rst, best, and except ); they're important guides to which option you should select. For example, if a question reads, \"Which of the follow-ing nursing actions should the nurse perform rst?\" you may nd that all the options are appropriate for the patient's condition but only one clearly takes precedence over the others. As you read the stem, cover up the answers on a paper test or ignore the computer screen with the answers and try to answer the question without regard to the answer options. Then look at the options to see if your answer is listed. If so, it's probably correct. By knowing the answer, you save time and have avoided second-guessing yourself. If you're not sure of the answer, read all the choices. If you select an option before reading every choice, you'll deny yourself the chance to evaluate them all. Try to nd an option that most closely resembles the one you thought would be correct and to eliminate at least two answers. Then, choose your best selection. If you don't nd a best selection, look for the best option available. Remember, you're looking for the best answer among those choices given. It may not be what you think is the best response, but it's all you have to work with. Mark that question to return to later if time permits. For some questions, you may see two options that seem correct and have trouble deciding between them. Look at them again, knowing that there must be a difference. Read the stem again; you may discover some-thing you didn't see before that will help you make a selection. If not and you still can't choose, make an educated guess using good test-taking strategies. As a last resort, select B or C. Again, mark that question to return to later. Despite thorough preparation, you may not know the answer to some questions. Relax. Remember that you're an expert practitioner and possess a wealth of information. Think of patient cases you've had, and recall information about them that you can apply to the question. Mentally review your note cards, or look at your scratch paper if that's allowed. Remind yourself of the principle involved, and recall what you know about applying that principle to practice situations. Don't spend too long on the question, though; mark the question and move on. As you look at other questions, you may nd information that helps you make an accurate selection for the question you had trouble with. After you've answered the last question, take a deep breath. Take a brief moment to refl ect on how many test questions you knew the correct answer to. Remember that you planned and studied and are Med-Surg_Chap01.indd 6 Med-Surg_Chap01.indd 6 8/2/2011 a successful certi cation examination 7 now well prepared to discriminate between the choices for test items you were uncertain about. Return to the questions you didn't answer or those you marked for later review, and then answer those ques-tions or review your answers for possible changes. Don't be afraid to change a selection if you later think of a better choice. Finally, complete the exam and submit it. For a paper-and-pencil exam be sure to erase any stray pencil marks before turning in the exam. If you're taking a paper-and-pencil exam, you'll be noti ed of your results in a few weeks. If you're taking a computerized exam, you'll nd out the results right away\u2014which can be frightening. Take another deep breath, and view your results. Whether you scored high enough to pass the certi cation exam or not, you should feel good that you created a study plan, worked on a timeline, and pre- pared to take the test. If you weren't successful, as soon as you leave the test center, write down the test items you were uncertain about. Then, go back and alter your study plan to include the items you listed. Taking the certi cation examination shows con dence in your knowledge of medical-surgical nursing. An organized study program, good test-taking strategies, and last-minute review of test items can lead to suc-cessful certi cation as a medical-surgical nurse.Multiple-choice questions on certi cation examinations are constructed according to strict psychometric standards. As shown here, each question has a stem and four options, including a key (correct answer) and three distractors (incorrect answers). A brief clinical situation or case study commonly precedes each question. Note how clearly the question is written, with no unnecessary words in the stem. Each option should be relatively uniform in length.Parts of a test question OptionsA. Iodine-containing 57-year-old patient is admitted with acute bronchitis. During the admission interview, he tells the nurse thathe is allergic to bananas. Based on this statement, the patient may also have an allergy to which drug or sub stance? Med-Surg_Chap01.indd 7 nursingFoundations of nursing 2 Nursing process /H18546History of the nursing process In the 1970s, the American Nurses Association (ANA) mandated that the nursing process be part of nursing practice and instituted a ve-step process (assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, and evaluation) In 1982, the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association, now known as NANDA International (NANDA-I), was established to develop, review, and update nursing diagnoses; this organization meets every 2 years /H18546Purpose of the nursing process The nursing process provides a basis for problem solving, clinical decisions, and individualized patient care It uses the scienti c method of observation, measurement, data collection, and data analysis to evalu- ate the needs of patients and their families The nursing process provides an organized and universal method of communication for nurses in education, practice, and research Through the nursing process, nurses have adopted a body of knowledge that's unique to nursing; this knowledge encompasses illness, illness prevention, and health maintenance /H18546Standards of practice The Standards of Clinical Nursing Practice are directly related to the nursing process Standard I (\"The nurse collects patient health data\") relates to step 1 of the nursing process (assess- ment) Standard II (\"The nurse analyzes the assessment data in determining diagnosis\") relates to step 2 of the nursing process (diagnosis) Standard III (\"The nurse identi es expected outcomes individualized to the patient\") and Standard IV (\"The nurse develops a care plan that prescribes interventions to attain expected outcomes\") relate to step 3 of the nursing process (planning) Standard V (\"The nurse implements the interventions in the care plan\") relates to step 4 of the nursing process (implementation) Standard VI (\"The nurse evaluates the patient's progress toward outcomes\") relates to step 5 of the nursing process (evaluation) These clinical standards use the steps of the nursing process to help achieve the standards of practice that have been set forth by state nurse practice acts and the ANA standards of professional perfor-mance as well as the Academy of Medical-Surgical Nurses Scope and Standards of Nursing Practice These varying standards help assure quality nursing care and provide the gauge by which to mea- sure quality /H18546Steps of the nursing process Assessment Assessment is the collection and organization of data Data collection involves the formation of a database from the patient interview, patient history, subjective data (what the patient says or believes), objective data (vital signs, laboratory results), and physical assessment (inspection, palpation, percussion, and auscultation) As a caregiver, the nurse assesses the patient, analyzes his needs, develops nursing diagnoses, and plans, delivers, and evaluates nursing interventions and patient outcomes. Advocate As an advocate, the nurse helps the patient and his family members interpret information from other health care pro-viders and make decisions about health-related needs. The nurse ensures the health, welfare, and safety of the patient. The nurse makes every attempt to respect the patient's decisions and to communicate those wishes to other mem-bers of the health care team. The nurse accepts the patient's decisions, even if they dif- fer from the decisions the nurse would make. Educator With a greater emphasis on health promotion and illness prevention, the nurse's role as an educator becomes increas-ingly important. As an educator, the nurse assesses learning needs, plans and implements teaching strategies to meet those needs, and evaluates the effectiveness of the teaching. The nurse employs interpersonal communication skills and principles of adult learning to provide patient teaching. The nurse considers the educational, cultural, and socio- economic background of the patient when planning and providing patient teaching. Coordinator As a coordinator, the nurse practices leadership and man- ages time, people, resources, and the environment in which the nurse provides care. The nurse carries out these tasks by directing, delegating, and coordinating activities. The nurse plays an important role in coordinating the efforts of all team members to meet the patient's goals, and may conduct team conferences to facilitate communication among team members. Discharge planner As a discharge planner, the nurse assesses the patient's needs for discharge starting at the time of admission, includ-ing the patient's support systems and living situation. The nurse links the patient with available community resources. Change agent As a change agent, the nurse works with the patient to address his health concerns and with staff members to address organizational and community concerns. The nurse employs a knowledge of change theory, which provides a framework for understanding the dynamics of change, human responses to change, and strategies for effecting change. The nurse serves as a role model in the community, assist- ing consumers in bringing about change to improve the environment, work conditions, or other factors that affect health. The nurse works to bring about change through legisla- tion by helping to shape and support the laws that mandate the use of safety seats and motorcycle helmets. Researcher As a researcher, the nurse takes part in nursing research, which promotes growth in the science of nursing and develops a scienti c basis for nursing practice, and applies research ndings to nursing practice. Even if not trained in nursing research methods, the nurse participates by remaining alert for nursing problems and asking questions about care practices. The nurse improves nursing care by incorporating research ndings into nursing practice and by communicat- ing research to others.Practice roles of the nurse No matter what the practice setting, the medical-surgical nurse assumes various roles. Data organization involves clustering related ndings, reviewing the amount and completeness of data, and evaluating it through comparison with normal or baseline data Data documentation involves recording all data on the patient's chart and comparing it with research and medical ndings Diagnosis Diagnosis is the identi cation of actual or potential health problems as indicated by the assessment data; it's also de ned as the responses to actual or potential health problems The diagnostic statement consists of three parts: identifying the problem or need, identifying the cause of the problem or need (\"related to\"), and identifying related signs and symptoms (\"as 2:44:28 Foundations of nursing A sample diagnostic statement is \"ineffective breathing pattern related to fatigue, as evidenced by shortness of breath, shallow respirations, and tachycardia\" Nursing diagnoses are organized in a taxonomy based on human response patterns (see NANDA-I taxonomy II by domain, page 342); they also may be grouped by functional health Planning involves determining expected outcomes, setting priorities, establishing goals, selecting appropriate interventions, and documenting care Priorities can be based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs (in which physical needs, such as oxygen and safety, take priority over psychosocial needs, such as self-esteem and self-actualization) or other factors Goals are established by identifying the desired outcomes; short-term and long-term goals can be de ned and are measurable and time-speci c Speci c nursing interventions are selected to develop an individualized care plan; interventions should specify times, frequencies, and amounts The care plan is documented so that all health care team members know the patient's individual- ized plan Implementation Implementation involves providing actual care to the patient Data collection and assessment continue during this step Evaluation To provide effective care, the goals, outcomes, and appropriateness of interventions must be evalu- ated on an ongoing basis in relation to the care plan During evaluation, the care plan is revised as needed in terms of nursing diagnoses, goals, out- comes, and interventions Roles of the nurse /H18546General information Nursing's goal is to promote, restore, and maintain the health of people, who are regarded as holistic beings Although the expectations for providing nursing care have expanded and increased, this goal has remained constant /H18546Roles In adapting to changing health care needs, nurses assume various roles in health care settings Each role has speci c responsibilities, but some facets of these roles are common to all nursing positions Medical-surgical nurses are not only caregivers but also educators, advocates, coordinators, agents of change, discharge planners, and researchers (see Practice roles of the nurse, page 9) Medical-surgical nurses as caregivers conduct independent assessments and implement patient care based on knowledge and skills and collaborate with other members of the health care team to imple-ment and evaluate that care Collaborative practice /H18546General information Successful collaboration requires respect for the unique contribution of each member of the health care team An interdisciplinary approach to care serves the patient's needs best /H18546Nurse-physician collaboration Collaboration is facilitated when nurses and physicians work together regularly Methods of encouraging nurse-physician collaboration include scheduling times to develop and sus- tain working partnerships, communicating openly and directly, and agreeing to discuss confl icts when they arise 8/2/2011 2:44:28 PMNursing research 11 /H18546Collaboration with other members of the health care team Collaboration with other health care providers, such as social workers, nutritionists, and physical, occupational, and respiratory therapists, requires an understanding of their roles General knowledge of these roles can be achieved by reading relevant articles and by communicating directly with members of these groups Interdisciplinary case conferences allow team members to learn about other health professionals' contributions to patient care; such conferences refl ect a facility's commitment to collaborative practice Case management /H18546General information Case management is a system of patient care delivery that focuses on achieving outcomes within spe- ci c time frames and using resources appropriately It includes the entire episode of illness, crossing all settings in which the patient receives care Research shows that nursing case management improves quality of care and reduces health care costs /H18546Case management versus managed care Case management differs from managed care, although both systems are designed to reduce costs and achieve quality outcomes Case management provides continuity of the care provided by linking people across clinical settings Managed care provides continuity of the care plan by linking tasks, shifts, and departments within the organization /H18546Goals of case management The goals of case management are the same regardless of setting An organization may designate individual case managers or group practice case managers; the latter can represent practitioner or clinical nurse specialist practices /H18546Role of case managers Case managers are accountable for patient and cost outcomes and may provide administrative, educational, and research services They collaborate with the attending physician, patient, family members, and other service providers They evaluate the patient's physical and mental health, functional capability, support systems, and nancial resources Interdisciplinary teams or individual providers perform the assessments, with the case manager coordinating the process Standardized instruments for collecting data are key to coordinating care With the patient and family, case managers formulate a care plan that includes mutually agreed-on goals with measurable objectives so that outcomes can be evaluated (critical pathways) They help provide the patient with appropriate resources to ful ll the care plan; case managers trou- bleshoot for the patient if problems arise They use performance improvement to evaluate the quality and cost-effectiveness of patient care /H18546Characteristics of case managers The ANA recommends that nurse case managers hold a baccalaureate degree in nursing and have 3 years of clinical experience; however, many organizations prefer nurses with master's degrees who are clinical specialists in the areas related to the patient's condition Successful case managers possess expert clinical knowledge and skills, can set realistic goals and outcomes, and clearly understand the nancial aspects of health care systems and strategies for quality improvement They skillfully communicate, negotiate, and collaborate with other health care providers and know what resources are available in health care institutions and the community Nursing research /H18546General information For nursing research to achieve full impact, its ndings must be applied in practice; nurses in administration, research, and practice must collaborate to create an environment in which nurses raise Med-Surg_Chap02.indd 11 Med-Surg_Chap02.indd 11 8/2/2011 2:44:28 PM 8/2/2011 2:44:28 PM12 Foundations of nursing questions about policies, look for solutions to problems, and develop protocols for testing innovations in nursing care The level of participation in research varies with the nurse's educational background An associate degree or diploma in nursing quali es the nurse to assist in identifying clinical prob- lems in nursing practice, to collect data in a structured format, and to work with a professional nurse in applying research ndings A baccalaureate degree in nursing allows the nurse to identify clinical problems that need further research, to critique research ndings for use in practice, to collect data, and to implement research ndings A master's degree in nursing permits the nurse to act as clinical expert in collaborating with an expe- rienced researcher and to provide leadership for integrating ndings in clinical nursing practice A doctoral degree allows the nurse to formulate nursing knowledge through research and theory development and to conduct funded independent research projects /H18546Types of research Quantitative research is a deductive process that aims to describe, explain, and test hypotheses and examine cause-and-effect relationships that apply to a wider universe; this type of research emphasizes facts and data to validate or extend existing knowledge Speci c terms are associated with quantitative research Control involves the use of design techniques to decrease the possibility of error, thereby increasing the potential for ndings that accurately refl ect reality Hypothesis is a formal statement of the expected relationships between two or more variables Sampling is the selecting of subjects that are representative of the population being studied Randomization is a sampling procedure used to provide each member of the study population with an equal chance of being selected for an intervention Independent variable describes the treatment or experimental variable that's manipulated or varied by the researcher to create an effect on the dependent variable Dependent variable is the response, behavior, or outcome that the researcher hopes to predict or explain; changes in the dependent variable are presumed to be caused by the independent variable Qualitative research is an inductive process that aims to understand, describe, and identify the mean- ing of phenomena for a particular context; this type of research emphasizes the development of new insights, theory, and knowledge Speci c terms are associated with qualitative research Bracketing requires the researcher to lay aside what's known about the experience being studied and be open to new insights Intuiting and refl ecting refer to focused awareness on the phenomena under study Theoretical sampling is the selecting of subjects on the basis of concepts that have theoretical rele vance to an evolving theory Saturation describes the point at which data collection is ended because continuing would result in \"more of the same\" /H18546Research process The quantitative research process consists of 10 steps: formulating the problem, reviewing related lit- erature, developing a theoretical framework, identifying research variables, formulating research ques-tions or hypotheses, selecting the research design, de ning the population and sampling procedures, developing a plan for data collection and analysis, implementing the research plan, and communicating ndings The qualitative research process follows different steps The initial literature review is less exhaustive to avoid oversensitizing the researcher to the subject matter; after key concepts emerge, a more extensive literature review is conducted, and its insights are woven into the analysis A theoretical framework is seldom used because the goal of qualitative research is to develop con- cepts, constructs, models, or theories based on the data; a theoretical framework can result from data analysis Med-Surg_Chap02.indd 12 Med-Surg_Chap02.indd 12 8/2/2011 2:44:28 Variables aren't preselected for study; they become evident as data collection proceeds Research questions are broad at rst and then become more focused as data are collected; hypoth- eses aren't formulated Guidelines for data collection exist, but the direction of the research can change as dictated by the data Evidence-based nursing practice /H18546General information Evidence-based nursing practice (EBNP) is synonymous with the perception of high-quality care It differs from research utilization, which starts with a research-based innovation that's evaluated for possible use in practice; it instead uses the best clinical evidence from research in making patient-care decisions and informing nursing practice It differs from evidence-based medicine because it doesn't rely solely on randomized control trials In general, rigorous studies are the best type of evidence for informing a nurse's actions, decisions, and interactions with patients Research-based evidence may come from both nursing studies and a broad array of other disciplines Sources for EBNP include quantitative and qualitative research, eastern and western therapies, patient advocacy, tradition, assumptions, and clinical practice guidelines EBNP also includes holistic forms of medicine, clinician expertise, and patient values, preference, and beliefs Nurses who incorporate high-quality research evidence in their practice are demonstrating profes- sional accountability to their patients Several current trends shape the need for nursing research in nursing practice A heightened focus on evidence-based practice A stronger knowledge base resulting from multiple con rmatory strategies Greater stress on integrative reviews Increased emphasis on multidisciplinary collaboration Expanded dissemination of research ndings Increased interest in outcomes research Emphasis on the visibility of nursing research /H18546Bene ts of EBNP EBNP often results in streamlined care that saves time and leads to desired outcomes It eliminates useless, outdated practices and rituals It eliminates nurses' stress and frustration in applying basic education to patient-care problems and new technology It can decrease nursing care costs by avoiding repetitious, undesirable, and expensive alternative outcomes It de-emphasizes decision making based on custom, authority, opinion, and ritual /H18546Implementation EBNP's emphasis is on identifying the best available evidence and integrating it with clinical exper- tise, patient input, and existing resources It can be implemented in the form of procedures, protocols, guidelines, standards of care, and clinical pathways The rst step in implementing EBNP is formulating a clinical question The nurse should next search for peer-reviewed articles on that clinical question Critically evaluating and comparing the articles is the third step After that, the nurse applies the information from the articles Finally, the nurse evaluates the outcome of the changes made in local practice /H18546Quality assurance A peer review of a research article provides an objective assessment of its quality, which depends on its validity and reliability The validity of research refers to its ability to measure what it claims to measure The reliability of a research refers to its ability to be repeated using a different design or setting but providing the same results Med-Surg_Chap02.indd 13 Med-Surg_Chap02.indd 13 8/2/2011 2:44:28 of nursing Using randomization, double-blinding, and control groups or large populations helps ensure research quality Not all research studies can use these methods; they may require alternatives that call for training and experience Randomization requires randomly assigning people to different groups, making it a hallmark of high-quality research When evaluating outcomes from applying EBNP, nurses should determine and document patient responses /H18546Barriers to EBNP Research-related barriers include fl aws in research design and method, lack of research reliability, and inaccessibility of ndings Nurse-related barriers include lack of skills in evaluating a study, poor attitudes and lack of motivation to engage in EBNP, and resistance to change Organizational barriers include resistance to change, lack of intellectual curiosity and openness, lack of time and support for EBNP, and reluctance to expend resources Profession-related barriers include lack of interaction among nurses, lack of role-models, and lack of independence in practice /H18546Improving EBNP It's important to value research as a way of knowing and as the foundation for informing and basing practice Nurses can take several steps to improve their use and application of research evidence Read widely and critically Attend professional conferences Learn to expect evidence that a procedure is effective Become involved in a journal club Pursue and participate in EBNP projects Administrators can also take steps to promote the use of research evidence Foster a climate of intellectual curiosity Offer emotional and moral support Provide nancial or resource support for using research evidence Reward efforts for using research evidence Seek opportunities for institutional research utilization or EBNP projects Successfully implementing EBNP requires the support of management, administration, and physicians Performance improvement and bene ts /H18546Performance improvement (PI) PI ensures a speci ed degree of excellence in patient care through continuous measurement and evaluation; it's used to implement change, not to identify problems or solutions It's a continuous three-stage cycle: measurement of observed nursing practice, comparison of observed practice with expectations (standards of practice), and implementation of change to reconcile discrepancies between observations and expectations Three approaches are used to evaluate the quality of care Structure evaluation examines the components of services, such as the setting and environment, which affect quality of care Process evaluation examines the activities and behaviors of the health care provider such as the nurse Outcome evaluation measures demonstrative changes in the patients' behaviors and attitudes Two types of review are used to evaluate the quality of care Retrospective review is a critical examination of past or completed health care delivery to a speci ed patient population; chart audits, postcare conferences, interviews, and questionnaires are used for this type of review Med-Surg_Chap02.indd 14 Med-Surg_Chap02.indd 14 8/2/2011 2:44:28 PM 8/2/2011 2:44:28 PMConsultation 15 Concurrent review is a critical examination of a patient's movement toward desired alterations in health status (outcomes) and patient care management (process) while patient care and treatment are in progress; chart audits, interviews, observation, and inspection of the patient are the usual sources of data Before a PI program is implemented, written descriptions are needed of the scope of services pro- vided to patients, the structure of the PI committee and its relation to other committees, the person responsible for PI activities, the procedures to be followed, the methods by which assessments are made, and the type of documentation necessary /H18546Bene ts PI programs bene t nurses and patients They help describe the scope of nursing practice and the effectiveness of nursing interventions in improving and maintaining patient health They give patients an opportunity to critique the care received, which helps ensure accountability for the care provided Risk management and related reports /H18546Risk management Risk management seeks to prevent accidents and injuries and control liability It has three main goals Decrease the number of claims by promptly identifying and following up on adverse events Reduce the frequency of preventable injuries and accidents leading to lawsuits by maintaining or improving the quality of care Control costs related to claims by pinpointing trouble spots early and working with the patient and his family Risk managers identify, analyze, and evaluate risks within their facility and formulate plans to decrease the frequency and severity of accidents and injuries /H18546Occurrence reports An occurrence, or incident, report is lled out when an event occurs that's inconsistent with a health care facility's ordinary routine, regardless of whether an injury occurs Examples of events that require an incident report to be led include medication errors, injuries from medical equipment (such as a burn), falls (even if the patient wasn't injured), and accidents and injuries involving family members, visitors, or staff members An occurrence report has two functions It informs the administration of the incident, so the risk manager can work to prevent similar inci- dents It alerts the administration and the facility's insurance company to a potential claim and the need for further investigation An occurrence report should be objective and include the names of the persons involved and any witnesses, the patient's account of what happened, factual information about the event, the conse-quences to the patient, who discovered the patient, your immediate action, who was noti ed and at what time, and the patient's response to the event An occurrence report shouldn't include your assumptions, opinions, suggestions, or accusations Consultation /H18546General information In a consultation, the nurse draws on internal and external resources to resolve a patient problem; formal consultation uses a written agreement that follows speci c steps, whereas informal consultation relies on a verbal agreement between colleagues or other staff members As health care organizations decentralize, staff nurses will become more involved in consultations /H18546Models of consultation Patient-centered case consultation provides expert advice on handling a particular patient or group of patients Med-Surg_Chap02.indd 15 Med-Surg_Chap02.indd 15 8/2/2011 2:44:28 PM 8/2/2011 2:44:28 PM16 Consultee-centered case consultation focuses on work dif culties with patients, which are used as a learning opportunity Program-centered administrative consultation provides expert advice on developing new programs or improving existing ones Consultee-centered administrative consultation considers work problems in the areas of program devel- opment and organization /H18546Formal consultation process The process begins with the initial contact, in which clear communication and an understanding of the consultation's goal are particularly important The second step is to formulate a contract, which establishes the framework for the process and helps minimize misunderstandings The negotiating process is followed by problem identi cation and diagnostic analysis, which results in a plan of action The plan of action is implemented, and feedback is obtained Finally, the consultant provides ndings and recommendations /H18546Informal consultation Informal consultation occurs among colleagues and requires the same principles and skills as those of formal consultation Increased specialization in nursing has resulted in more nurse clinicians tapping the expertise of other nurses to improve patient care The decision whether to implement the recommendations of the consultant rests with the individual or group who sought the consultation Patient teaching /H18546General information The educational process uses a problem-solving approach similar to that of the nursing process Assessment and evaluation are continuous, so that planning and teaching strategies can be adapted to t the situation /H18546Educational process The educational process involves the development of a teaching plan based on a patient's and fam- ily's needs The patient's educational needs and type of teaching plan depend on the patient's current knowledge and perceived need, education and reading ability, environment (including culture and support sys-tems), readiness to learn, and learning style The teaching plan outlines the learning objectives, content, and teaching methods to be used During implementation, the nurse must document activities and monitor progress so that changes can be made quickly if needed The effects of teaching can be evaluated by testing skills with return demonstrations, creating hypo- thetical situations and testing the patient's response, and letting the patient explain his understanding of a topic If further education is needed, the nurse can refer a patient to other resources in the community /H18546Documentation The nurse documents all teaching activities The nurse also documents when the patient isn't ready to learn because of dif culty coping with an illness, uncontrolled pain, or other factors The nurse documents the data on which patient assessment is based and includes the action taken /H18546Practical aspects of teaching Teaching by nurses may be informal and may occur while the nurse performs other activities Accurate assessment of a patient's needs is the key to effective and ef cient use of nursing time Negotiating with patients on educational needs acknowledges their responsibility in the process and is more effective in the long term Med-Surg_Chap02.indd 16 Med-Surg_Chap02.indd 16 8/2/2011 2:44:28 PM 8/2/2011 2:44:28 PMHealth and wellness promotion 17 To meet patient and family learning needs, the nurse can use creative methods, such as waiting-room teaching sessions and printed materials and other media Before patients are discharged, the nurse must ensure that they're aware of the critical information pertaining to their condition and document this in the medical record Health and wellness promotion /H18546Health The World Health Organization describes health as a \"state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or in rmity\" Sociologists view health as a condition that allows for the pursuit and enjoyment of desired cultural values, including the ability to carry out activities of daily living, such as working and performing household chores Others take a more holistic and subjective view of health and describe it as a level of wellness in which a person is striving to attain his full potential One of the nurse's primary functions is to help patients reach an optimal level of wellness Several factors affect a patient's health status; the nurse must be aware of these factors when assess- ing the patient and plan to tailor interventions accordingly Genetics\u2014a person's biological and genetic makeup\u2014can cause illness and lead to chronic conditions Cognitive abilities affect a person's view of health and his ability to seek out and use resources Demographics, such as age and sex, can determine the prevalence of certain diseases in certain groups Culture helps determine a person's perception of health, motivations to seek care, and the types of health practices performed Lifestyle choices and environment such as diet, level of activity, and exposure to toxins, can infl u- ence a patient's health Health beliefs and practices can affect health positively or negatively Previous health experiences can infl uence a patient's reaction to illness and the decision to seek care Spirituality affects a person's view of illness and health care Support systems affect the degree to which a person adapts and copes with a situation /H18546Illness Illness can be de ned as a sickness or deviation from a healthy state; it's considered a broader con- cept than disease Illness occurs when a person is no longer in a state of perceived \"normal\" health Illness also encompasses how a patient interprets a disease's source and importance, how that dis- ease affects his behavior and relationships with others, and how the patient tries to remedy the problem The nurse must understand the meaning a person attaches to the experience of being ill Disease commonly refers to a speci c biological or psychological problem that's supported by clinical manifestations and results in body system or organ malfunction A disease is detected when it causes a change in metabolism or cell division that produces signs and symptoms In the absence of intervention, resolution of the disease depends on many factors functioning over a period of time, such as the extent of the disease and the presence of other diseases Manifestations of disease may include hypofunction, hyperfunction, or increased or decreased mechanical function Disease occurs or progresses through stages In exposure or injury , target tissue is exposed to a causative agent or injury During the latency or incubation period , no evident signs or symptoms occur In the prodromal period , the patient generally has mild, nonspeci c signs and symptoms During the acute phase, the disease is at its full intensity, possibly with complications; this is called the subclinical acute phase if the patient still functions as though the disease weren't present Med-Surg_Chap02.indd 17 Med-Surg_Chap02.indd 17 8/2/2011 2:44:29 PM 8/2/2011 PM18 Foundations of nursing Remission is a secondary latency phase that occurs in some diseases and is commonly followed by another acute phase During convalescence , the patient progresses toward recovery During recovery , the patient returns to health or normal functioning, with no remaining signs or symptoms of disease Illness can be acute or chronic Acute illness refers to a disease or condition that has a relatively abrupt onset, high intensity, and short duration; if no complications occur, most acute illnesses end in full recovery, with a patient returning to his previous or similar level of functioning Chronic illness refers to a condition that typically has a slower onset, less intensity, and a longer duration than acute illness, with a patient typically experiencing periods of exacerbation; the nurse's goal is to help the patient regain and maintain the highest possible level of health, although a patient may fail to return to his previous level of functioning /H18546Health and wellness promotion Good health practices have the bene t of fewer illnesses, a longer life-span, and lower health care costs Health promotion involves teaching people good health practices and nding ways to help them cor- rect their poor health practices Healthy People 2020 sets forth major comprehensive health goals for the United States, with the aim of reducing mortality and morbidity in all ages Increase the quality and years of life Eliminate health disparities among segments of the population, such as those that occur by gender, race, education, disabilities, geographic location, and sexual orientation Health indicators used to measure the health of the nation are physical activity, tobacco use, respon- sible sexual behavior, mental health, being overweight or obese, substance abuse, injury and violence, environmental quality, immunization, and access to health care The components of health promotion are self-responsibility, stress reduction and management, phys- ical tness, and nutritional awareness Self-responsibility is based on the theory that the individual has a responsibility to control his life and can make choices to live a healthy lifestyle or not Stress reduction and management recognizes the role stress can play in disease and focuses on the importance of managing stress Physical tness has become increasingly important as the nation struggles with obesity Nutritional awareness involves understanding the importance of a healthy diet and recognizing the role diet can play in disease or wellness Patient safety /H18546General information Patient safety is such an integral part of nursing that The Joint Commission has developed National Patient Safety Goals to protect patients The purpose of National Patient Safety Goals is to improve patient safety by focusing on problems in health care safety and how to solve them /H18546Patient identi cation Nurses should follow certain procedures to ensure correctly identifying each patient Use at least two patient identi ers according to the facility's policy to identify the patient Don't use the patient's room number as a patient identi er Use two patient identi ers when administering medications and blood products, taking blood samples and other specimens for testing, providing treatment, and performing procedures Label containers used for blood and other specimens in front of the patient /H18546Caregiver communication Nurses should maintain clear, effective, and timely communication among caregivers When verbal or telephone orders are necessary, write down the order for the medication or treatment prescribed and read the complete order back to the person who prescribed it to verify its accuracy Med-Surg_Chap02.indd 18 Med-Surg_Chap02.indd 18 8/2/2011 2:44:29 PM 8/2/2011 2:44:29 PMDelegation 19 When reading the order back to the person who prescribed it, receive con rmation from the person who gave the order For critical test results reported over the telephone, follow speci c guidelines Write down the test result or enter it into a computer Verify the critical test results by reading them back to the person giving the results Receive con rmation from the person who gave the test result Make sure that test results are given only to the patient's licensed, responsible caregiver Measure and assess the timeliness of reporting and the timeliness of receipt by the licensed responsible caregiver If appropriate, take action if critical test results aren't reported or received in a timely manner /H18546Medication safety Look-alike and sound-alike drugs used in the facility should be identi ed and reviewed at least annually and measures should be taken to prevent errors caused by interchanging these drugs Medications, medication containers (syringes, medicine cups, and basins), or other solutions used on and off the sterile eld in perioperative and other procedural settings must be clearly labeled Speci ed measures must be taken to reduce the likelihood of harm to patients on anticoagulation therapy /H18546Infection protection Health care-associated infections are a leading cause of sickness and death in health care facilities, prolong stays in facilities, and increase health care costs Hand washing is one of the most effective techniques for reducing the risk of health care-associated infections The Joint Commission mandates following the current hand hygiene guidelines of the World Health Organization or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wash your hands with soap and water when visibly soiled, before eating, and after going to the bathroom Use an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water when decontaminating hands that aren't visibly soiled Perform hand hygiene before putting on gloves Perform hand hygiene before and after each patient contact Perform hand hygiene before handling an invasive device for patient care Perform hand hygiene after contact with inanimate objects in close proximity to the patient Perform hand hygiene after contact with bodily fl uids or excretions, wound dressings, nonintact skin, or mucous membranes Health care facilities must implement evidence-based practices to prevent health care-associated infections from multiresistant organisms in acute care health care facilities, central line-associated bloodstream infections, and surgical site infections /H18546Patient safety risks According to The Joint Commission, health care facilities should identify safety risks inherent in their patient populations Identify patients who may be at risk for suicide Identify speci c factors that may increase or decrease risk for suicide Address immediate patient safety needs Ensure that the setting for treatment is appropriate Give patients and their family members information, such as crisis hotline numbers, for crisis situations Delegation /H18546General information Delegation occurs when a nurse assigns tasks and the authority to complete those tasks to other personnel, such as unlicensed assistive personnel (UAP) The ANA de nes a UAP as an individual trained to function in an assistive role to the registered professional nurse in the provision of patient care activities, as delegated by and under the supervision of that nurse Med-Surg_Chap02.indd 19 Med-Surg_Chap02.indd 19 8/2/2011 2:44:29 PM 8/2/2011 Further de nition and clari cation regarding delegation of nursing tasks may be de ned by Nurse Practice Acts in individual states /H18546Delegation process The nurse should know facility policy regarding delegation and only delegate tasks (but not the nursing process) that the UAP is competent to perform UAPs make observations, collect clinical data, and report ndings to the nurse Responsibility for the task is delegated but not the accountability, so the nurse should receive regular updates from the UAP, ask speci c questions, and make frequent rounds of patients The nurse must evaluate the task and the outcome and ensure that they're accurately documented in the medical record Review questions 1. The registered nurse has an unlicensed assistant working with her for the shift. When delegating tasks, the nurse understands that the unlicensed assistant: /H18540A. interprets clinical data. /H18540B. collects clinical data. /H18540C. is trained in the nursing process. /H18540D. can function independently. Correct answer: B Unlicensed personnel make observations, collect clinical data, and report ndings to the nurse. Option A is incorrect because the registered nurse, who has learned critical thinking skills, interprets the data. Option C is incorrect because although unlicensed assistants are trained to perform skills, they don't learn the nursing process. Option D is incorrect because unlicensed assistants don't function independently; they're assigned tasks by a registered nurse who retains overall responsibility for the patient. 2. When performing an assessment, the nurse identi es the following signs and symptoms: impaired coordi- nation, decreased muscle strength, limited range of motion, and reluctance to move. These signs and symptoms indicate which nursing diagnosis? /H18540A. Health-seeking behaviors /H18540B. Impaired physical mobility /H18540C. Disturbed sensory perception /H18540D. De cient knowledge Correct answer: B Impaired physical mobility is a limitation of physical movement and is de ned by the patient's signs and symptoms. Options A, C, and D are nursing diagnoses with different de ning signs and symptoms. 3. When prioritizing a patient's care plan based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the nurse's rst priority would be: /H18540A. allowing the family to see a newly admitted patient. /H18540B. ambulating the patient in the hallway. /H18540C. administering pain medication. /H18540D. using two nurses to transfer the patient. Correct answer: C In Maslow's hierarchy of needs, pain relief is on the rst layer. Activity (Option B) is on the second layer. Safety (Option D) is on the third layer. Love and belonging (Option A) are on the fourth layer. Med-Surg_Chap02.indd 20 Med-Surg_Chap02.indd 20 8/2/2011 2:44:29 PM 8/2/2011 2:44:29 PMReview questions 21 4. When a nurse asks another nurse for advice on handling a particular patient problem, she's seeking what type of consultation? /H18540A. Patient-centered case consultation /H18540D. Consultee-centered administrative consultation Correct answer: A Patient-centered case consultation (Option A) provides expert advice on handling a particular patient or group of patients. Consultee-centered case consultation (Option B) focuses on work dif culties with patients, which are used as a learning opportunity. Program-centered administrative consultation (Option C) provides expert advice on developing new programs or improving existing ones. Consultee-centered administrative consultation (Option D) considers work problems in the areas of pro-gram development and organization. 5. When implementing an evidence-based nursing program to decrease the incidence of pressure ulcers on a medical-surgical unit, which of the following is the most important to ensure its success? /H18540A. Obtaining support from management, administration, and physicians /H18540B. Determining and documenting patient outcomes /H18540C. Identifying a signi cant problem that needs to be addressed /H18540D. Evaluating research based on its validity and reliability Correct answer: A To successfully implement an evidence-based nursing program, it's important to obtain the support of management, administration, and physicians. Option B is part of evaluating evidence-based nursing program implementation. Option C is part of the rst step of the evidence-based nursing program process. Option D is part of the critical evaluation of resources. 6. When planning the implementation of evidence-based practices to prevent falls, which of the following steps should the nurse take rst? /H18540A. Identify the common causes of falls. /H18540B. Gather and review currently existing literature and guidelines for the prevention of falls. /H18540C. Identify fall prevention practices that are applicable to the patient care setting. /H18540D. Gather data to identify the effectiveness of the new practice guidelines. Correct answer: B Options A, B, and C are correct steps in planning for the implementation of evi- dence-based practices; however, Option B would be the initial step, followed by Options A and C. Option D is part of the evaluation phase of evidence-based practice implementation. 7. Which measure most effectively reduces the risk of health care-associated infections? /H18540A. Keeping employee health records up-to-date /H18540C. Providing annual infl uenza vaccinations /H18540D. Always wearing a mask when caring for patients Correct answer: B Performing hand hygiene in compliance with the World Health Organization or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines is the most effective in reducing the risk of health care-associated infections. Keeping employee health records up-to-date (Option A), providing annual infl uenza vaccinations (Option C), and always wearing a mask when caring for patients (Option D) aren't the most effective ways to reduce the risk of health care-associated infections.

Correct answer: A A secondary latency phase that occurs in some diseases that is commonly followed by another acute phase is referred to as remission. Convalescence (Option B) is progression toward recovery. The acute phase (Option C) refers to the disease at its full intensity, possibly with complica-tions. The subclinical acute phase (Option D) occurs when the patient is in the acute phase but still func-tions as if the disease weren't present. 10. Qualitative research emphasizes developing new insights, theories, and knowledge. Which term in qualita- tive research describes the researcher laying aside what is known about the experience being studied? /H18540A. A Bracketing requires the researcher to lay aside what's known about the experience being studied and be open to new insights. Saturation (Option B) describes the point at which data collec-tion is ended because continuing would result in acquiring more of the same information or data. Intuit-ing (Option C) refers to the focused awareness on the phenomena being studied. Theoretical sampling (Option D) is the selecting of subjects on the basis of concepts that have theoretical relevance to an evolv-ing theory. Med-Surg_Chap02.indd 22 Med-Surg_Chap02.indd 22 8/2/2011 PMLegal and ethical aspects of nursingLegal and ethical aspects of nursing 3 23 Nurse practice acts /H18546State statutes Each state has statutes, or nurse practice acts, that de ne the levels of nursing (for example, advanced practice nurse [nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, certi ed nurse midwife, certi ed nurse anes- thetist], registered nurse, licensed practical nurse, and nursing assistant); they're the most important laws governing nurses and nursing practice Most statutes set licensure requirements for each level of nursing They may prescribe minimum educational quali cations for licensure Regulatory boards created by the nurse practice acts govern nursing practice in the state Nurse practice acts may provide for a board of nursing accreditation and approval of educational programs in the state /H18546Disciplinary actions The state board of nursing may take action against a nurse who violates the nurse practice act or the licensing board's regulations (see Common legal concerns for nurses, page 24) A nurse can be disciplined for habitual substance abuse affecting the ability to practice, fraud or deceit in obtaining a nursing license, incompetence, criminal felony conviction, and unprofessional conduct Other actions or conditions that would inhibit the nurse's safe and effective nursing practice also are grounds for discipline A licensed nurse has a limited property right to her license The state must follow speci c procedures to determine if a nurse's license should be revoked to protect public safety The licensee must be noti ed of the complaint, must have an opportunity to respond to the com- plaint and present evidence, and must be allowed to have a hearing before an impartial panel and to appeal the panel's decision /H18546Possible sanctions The nurse's license may be revoked The license may be suspended for a predetermined time The license may be suspended for an undetermined time, and the nurse may reapply after complet- ing a course of study or treatment Conditions may be placed on the license to limit the nurse's practice The nurse may voluntarily surrender the license or enter into a consensual agreement with the nurs- ing board, agreeing to limitations on the license or supervision of practice for a time The nurse may receive a disciplinary warning or reprimand Legal concepts of responsibility /H18546Individuals In the absence of mental or legal incapacity, a person is responsible for his own actions; a nurse, as a professional, is legally accountable for her nursing assessment and care Although the nurse may be individually accountable, other people or entities also may be legally responsible for a nurse's negligence Med-Surg_Chap03.indd 23 Med-Surg_Chap03.indd 23 8/2/2011 2:44:51 PM 8/2/2011 2:44:51 PM24 Legal and ethical aspects of nursing MT Con dentiality Con dential information is any information that the patient communicates to the nurse or practitioner for diagnosis or treatment with the expectation that it won't be disclosed. Nurses have an ethical and legal duty to avoid disclosing such con dential information to unauthorized people who aren't involved in the patient's care and treatment. A nurse who discloses con dential information without the patient's permission may be subject to a lawsuit or dis-ciplinary action for unprofessional conduct. The nurse can be liable for invasion of privacy, defamation, intentional or negligent infl iction of emotional distress, or breach of an implied contract of secrecy. Some states provide a statu-tory penalty against health care providers who violate the patient's right to con dentiality. However, con dential information can be disclosed under certain circumstances. For example, the nurse must disclose such information when authorized by a patient (but only to the extent authorized), when a patient is a danger to himself or others, or when required by law for a report-able communicable disease or suspected abuse. In some cases, the court may order disclosure of con dential patient information. Consent to treatment The law presumes that adults are legally capable of con-senting to treatment. To pro vide a valid consent, a patient must be mentally capable of understanding the nature and consequences of treatment. Expressed consent is obtained orally or in writing; implied consent is obtained by the patient's voluntarily submitting to treatment. Medical treat- ment performed without a patient's expressed or implied consent may result in legal claims of battery or negligence. Therefore, informed consent should be obtained before a patient undergoes an invasive procedure, receives anesthesia or blood, or undergoes procedures that carry a signi cant risk of harm. Informed consent requires the health care provider (physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, nurse midwife) to provide appropriate informa-tion. The adequacy of this information is evaluated by two questions: Did the health care provider provide informa-tion that a reasonably competent health care provider in the same situation would provide? Did the patient receive suf cient information such that a reasonable person in the same circumstances could make an informed decision? If a patient receives appropriate information and refuses care or treatment against medical advice, the physician or health care provider is responsible for documenting that the informed consent conversation took place, the general facts discussed, and the patient's decision. Exceptions to informed consent Informed consent isn't required if a delay to obtain consent for emergency treatment would cause imminent harm that outweighs the risk of treatment, if the patient would be substantially harmed by disclosing the risks of treatment, if the patient waives the right to consent and asks not to be informed, or if compulsory treatment is mandated by law or a court order. Right to refuse treatment Adults are presumed to be legally capable of refusing treat-ment. In fact, mentally competent patients with terminal conditions can refuse life-sustaining treatment without cre-ating legal liability for their health care providers. The Patient Self-Determination Act of 1990 encourages persons to express their wishes about life-sustaining treat-ment should they become legally incapacitated. The act requires health care facilities that participate in Medicare and Medicaid to develop programs to inform patients about advance directives, such as living wills and durable powers of attorney and do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders. Under this act, the health care facility must provide patients with writ-ten materials explaining their rights under their state laws to make decisions concerning medical care, including the right to accept or refuse treatment and the right to execute an advance directive. A living will expresses a patient's wishes about withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatment. A durable power of attorney designates a person to make health care decisions, including termination of life support, for a patient who can no longer do so. A DNR order authorizes health care personnel not to initiate resuscitative measures. The Patient Self-Determination Act speci cally prohibits covered health care facilities from conditioning the provision of care or discriminating against an individual based on whether the individual has executed an advance directive. When a patient is no longer mentally capable of mak- ing health care decisions, a court order, statute, or law may authorize a surrogate decision maker to accept or refuse medical treatment for the pa tient based on the patient's prior documentation or expressed wishes.Common legal concerns for nurses Three areas commonly cause legal problems for nurses: con dentiality, consent to treatment, and the right to refuse treatment. /H18546Employers and supervisors An employer is automatically liable for its employees' actions within the scope of their employment; the employer is thereby encouraged to hire competent employees A nurse in a management or supervisory position may be liable for the actions of a negligent nurse under her supervision; liability can result if the supervisor didn't adequately assess the nurse's PM actions 25 competence or the assignment's requirements, didn't adequately supervise the nurse's performance, or knew the nurse's limitations and didn't provide adequate training or staf ng /H18546Independent contractors An independent contractor is one who contracts with another to do a speci c job; in nursing, the pri- vate duty nurse who is employed by an agency but hired on a per diem basis by a health care facility is the most common example of an independent contractor The independent contractor's actions aren't directly controlled by the employer; the contractor has independent discretion in performing the job The employer may not be liable for the negligent actions of an independent contractor unless the employer knew or should have known of the independent contractor's incompetence /H18546Corporations A health care facility is obligated to carefully monitor the credentials and competence of employees and independent contractors A health care facility that doesn't ensure its workers' competence may be liable for injuries caused by the workers' negligence Possible civil actions /H18546Torts A tort is a civil action for damages for injury to a person, property, or reputation Torts are classi ed as unintentional or intentional /H18546Unintentional torts Professional negligence and professional malpractice are the most common legal claims against nurses Negligence is the failure to exercise the degree of care that a person of ordinary prudence would exercise under the same circumstances; for example, if a nurse notices water on the fl oor of a room and doesn't wipe it up, and the water causes a patient to fall and injure himself, this constitutes negligence The plaintiff in a negligence suit must prove that the nurse's actions caused harm Professional malpractice or professional negligence requires a plaintiff to introduce proof of duty, breach of duty, proximate cause, and damages or harm; proof of the nurse's standard of care is criti-cal to establishing the rst three elements Unlike negligence cases, professional negligence cases require expert testimony as to the duty of care, its breach, and its causal relationship to the injury A nurse also can be sued for negligent infl iction of emotional distress In many states, a plaintiff can be awarded damages for severe emotional distress resulting from a nurse's negligent actions Some states require that the plaintiff have physical manifestations of the emotional distress, such as palpitations, gastric discomfort, or insomnia /H18546Intentional torts Assault is an act that places a patient in fear of harmful or offensive touching Battery is touching a patient without justi cation or permission Defamation results when a nurse communicates false information verbally (slander) or in writing (libel) about a patient that damages the patient's reputation or causes the patient to be shunned or avoided by the community Invasion of privacy occurs when a nurse gives unauthorized access to the patient or information about the patient; taking photographs of a patient without permission is an invasion of privacy Fraud and misrepresentation are false or misleading statements by the nurse that the patient relies on to his detriment False imprisonment is unjusti able restriction of patient movement Intentional infl iction of emotional distress results when a nurse's actions produce distress so severe that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it Med-Surg_Chap03.indd 25 Med-Surg_Chap03.indd 25 8/2/2011 2:44:52 PM 8/2/2011 2:44:52 PM26 Legal and ethical aspects of nursing /H18546Contract actions Contract actions are determined by whether the parties performed obligations agreed to in a contract A breach of contract results when one party fails to perform as required by the contract Nurses are most commonly involved in employment contracts and malpractice insurance contracts Possible defenses to a health care negligence suit /H18546Comparative and contributory negligence With comparative negligence (the more common defense), the jury compares the degree of negli- gence of the parties or of various defendants and apportions damages (that is, compensation or indem-ni cation) accordingly With contributory negligence, because the plaintiff's conduct contributes to the cause of his injury and falls below the standard by which individuals are expected to conform, he can't recover damages, even though the defendant violated a duty of care to the plaintiff and would be liable /H18546Statutes of limitation A statute of limitation sets a time limit within which the legal action must be brought; a nurse can't be sued for negligence if the claim is made after the time limit expires Statutes of limitation for health care negligence are established by the state legislature These statutes may not apply in some cases, such as those involving fraudulent concealment of n egligence or later discovery of negligence /H18546Good Samaritan laws All states have Good Samaritan laws to protect people who render assistance at the scene of an emergency Some statutes protect all citizens; others cover only speci ed health care providers Those protected under Good Samaritan laws are liable only for grossly negligent acts /H18546Statutory defenses Many states have statutes that prescribe special procedures for health care negligence cases A suit may be dismissed if the statutory requirements aren't met Professional liability insurance for nurses /H18546Types of policies A claims-made policy provides coverage for claims made during the policy period An occurrence policy provides coverage for negligence that occurs during the policy period /H18546Obligations of the insurer and the insured Insurers must provide and pay for legal counsel to defend the nurse in the lawsuit and must pay damages (within coverage limits) for which the nurse is judged liable The nurse must notify the insurer that a claim has been made and must assist as needed in preparing the defense (see Reducing nursing liability, page 28) Patient's bill of rights /H18546Self-determination Self-determination is often used synonymously with autonomy It means having a form of personal liberty to choose and implement one's own decisions, free from deceit, duress, constraint, or coercion It involves the right of patients to decide what will or will not happen to their bodies Basic elements of self-determination include the patient's ability to decide, the power to act upon his own decision, and respect for the individual autonomy of others Although self-determination is often addressed in relation to death and dying, it concerns all aspects of consent and its refusal To practice this right, the individual must be competent to make his own decisions about accepting or refusing treatment Some states uphold the patient's in orally expressed desires, provided they're documented, including the patient's awareness of consequences of his actions Med-Surg_Chap03.indd 26 Med-Surg_Chap03.indd 26 8/2/2011 2:44:52 PM 8/2/2011 2:44:52 PMEthical aspects of nursing 27 The Patient Self-Determination Act has three basic premises Patients who are informed of their rights are more likely to take advantage of them If patients are more actively involved in decisions about their medical care, then that care will more closely respond to their needs Patients may choose care that is less costly /H18546Informed consent Informed consent is the voluntary authorization by a patient to a care provider to do something to the patient Some states accept oral forms of consent as being equally as valid as written consent Contents of an informed consent include the procedural information, associated risks and bene ts, alternatives to the procedure, and the name of the person who will perform the procedure Generally, physicians have the responsibility to obtain informed consents Nurses can witness and have the responsibility to advocate for the patient to ensure that all criteria for autonomous decision making are met Four exceptions to consents are emergency situations, therapeutic privilege, patient waiver, and prior patient knowledge /H18546Living wills Living wills, or health care directives, are directives from competent individuals to medical person- nel regarding treatment they wish to receive A living will takes effect when the previously competent person becomes sick and can no longer make decisions for himself It typically contains information about the conservator or health care agent, the patient's code status, and the patient's desire for organ donation; it may also contain other information Because living wills aren't typically legally enforced, medical practitioners may choose to abide by them or to ignore them as they see t There's no protection for the practitioner against criminal or civil liabilities for proceeding under a living will's directions /H18546Durable power of attorney Durable (or medical) power of attorney for health care allows competent patients to appoint a surro- gate to make decisions for them in the event that they lose competence The power includes the right to ask questions, select and remove physicians from the patient's care, assess risks and complications, and select treatments Ethical aspects of nursing /H18546General information Ethics is a branch of philosophy that examines values, actions, and choices to determine right and wrong Nursing ethics is part of normative ethics, a type of ethics that's based on the criteria by which people make moral judgments As the basis for professional codes of ethics, ethical theories attempt to provide a system of prin- ciples and rules for resolving ethical dilemmas The American Nurses Association's \"Code of Ethics for Nurses\" provides guidance for carrying out nursing responsibilities consistent with the ethical obligations of the profession Morality involves rules of conduct about right and wrong It's based on norms of conduct determined by society Society's moral codes guide what people ought to do; professional codes, such as the code of ethics for nurses, communicate the goals and ideals of a profession Although ethics and morals are theoretically distinct terms, they're used interchangeably to describe right and wrong actions /H18546Professional code of ethics for nurses Nurses have a contract with society to behave in accordance with rules dictated by society and the nursing profession Med-Surg_Chap03.indd 27 Med-Surg_Chap03.indd 27 8/2/2011 2:44:52 PM 8/2/2011 2:44:52 PM28 Legal and ethical aspects of nursing The nurse can take measures to reduce liability in several areas. Liability area Prevention measures Competent practice Know your practice area, and stay current in the eld. Recognize your strengths and limitations. Be familiar with the American Nurses Association's Standards of Practice and the standards of practice of appropriate specialty groups. Build a good relationship with your patients. Review and follow your facility's nursing policies and procedures. Charting Record information accurately, promptly, and legibly. Use only approved abbreviations. Record the assessment of the patient completely. Record all nursing actions and the patient's responses to them. Correct mistaken entries by drawing a single line through them and initialing the line; don't obliterate the mistaken entry. Correct errors in computer documentation as directed by the computer program used. Never falsify, alter, or destroy a patient's record. Access to medical records Follow Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act guidelines as developed by the health care facility. Release copies of medical records to the patient on proper request and to others authorized by the patient. Release human immunode ciency virus or acquired immunode ciency syndrome test results as required by state law. Don't release alcohol or other substance abuse counseling records unless explicitly authorized; a general authorization is insuf cient. Don't release protected documents to the patient, such as incident reports and peer-review materials. Common sources of injuries Know the facility's fall-risk policies and procedures. Falls Assess every patient's risk of falling based on the facility's protocol. Monitor all patients identi ed as at risk, and document accordingly. Medications Know the facility's protocols and procedures regarding speci c drugs, such as insulin and anticoagulants. Keep current about commonly used drugs in your practice. Review package insert information before administering drugs. Be vigilant when preparing and administering drugs. Question all unusual orders. Recheck orders questioned by the patient. Restraints Follow institutional policy regarding restraints. Exhaust all alternative methods of care before considering restraints. Monitor restrained patients according to the facility's policies and standards. Inadequate patient education Assess the patients cognitive ability and willingness to learn, and document accordingly. Assess the patient's knowledge before and after teaching. Use written, verbal, and audio-visual teaching methods. Use return demonstration of physical skills. Document the patient's response to teaching.Reducing nursing liability 2:44:52 PM 8/2/2011 2:44:52 PMEthical aspects of nursing 29 Whereas nurse practice acts set the legal standards for safe nursing practice, the code for nurses delineates nursing's moral ideals, provides guidelines for ethically principled behavior, and holds nurses morally accountable for their actions (see Code of Ethics for Nurses, page 30) /H18546Ethical theories Deontology holds that an act's moral rightness is determined by the inherent duty one has to act in accordance with rules and principles It presumes that the rightness of an act is determined by the intent to conform with a moral rule, not by the consequences of the act Immanuel Kant is a principal deontologic theorist Utilitarianism holds that an act's moral rightness is determined by its ability to produce good conse- quences and to avoid harmful ones It presumes that the rightness of an act is determined by its consequences, not by the person's intent John Stuart Mill and Jeremy Bentham are utilitarian theorists /H18546Ethical principles Autonomy is a state of being self-regulating, self-de ning, and self-reliant Immanuel Kant believed that all people are worthy of unconditional positive regard (Kantian prin- ciple of \"respect for persons\"); he also introduced the concept of freedom of will John Stuart Mill believed that a person should be respected for his freedom of thought and action The principle of autonomy, that actions and choices shouldn't be restricted by others, has many clinical applications A patient's right to informed consent derives from the principle of autonomy The principle of \"respect for persons\" dictates that a patient has a right to treatment and a right to refuse treatment Advance directives, such as living wills and durable powers of attorney for health care, maintain a patient's autonomy Bene cence is a moral principle that holds that individuals should promote good Based on the duty to help, bene cence requires nurses to act in their patients' best interests This principle may create a duty when the law doesn't This principle often confl icts with the principle of autonomy\u2014for example, a nurse may violate the autonomy principle by preventing a patient from acting on suicidal impulses (a bene cent act) Nonmale cence mandates that a nurse doesn't harm others or put them at risk for harm; this prin- ciple causes many debates about euthanasia, withholding and withdrawing treatment, and the use of arti cial hydration and nutrition Justice is a moral concept that maintains equals should be treated equally and those who aren't equal should be treated according to their differences; it's used when there are scarcities or competition for resources or bene ts Veracity obligates the nurse to be truthful with patientsReducing nursing liability (continued) Liability area Prevention measures Abandonment Don't leave a patient without arranging for continuing care. Give a complete report when transferring care, and reconcile the patient's drugs across the continuum. Document the completion of treatment. Malfunctioning equipment Check equipment according to the manufacturer's recommendation and the facility's protocol. Have malfunctioning equipment xed or replaced immediately. Notify appropriate authorities of the problem and the action taken.

The nurse, in all professional relationships, practices with compassion and respect for the inherent dignity, worth, and uniqueness of every individual, unrestricted by consider-ations of social or economic status, personal attributes, or the nature of health problems. 2. The nurse's primary commitment is to the patient, whether an individual, family, group, or community. 3. The nurse promotes, advocates for, and strives to project the health, safety, and rights of the patient. 4. The nurse is responsible and accountable for individual nursing practice and determines the appropriate delegation of tasks consistent with the nurse's obligation to provide optimum patient care. 5. The nurse owes the same duties to self as to others, including the responsibility to preserve integrity and safety, to maintain competence, and to continue personal and professional growth.6. The nurse participates in establishing, maintaining, and improving health care environments and conditions of employment conducive to the provision of quality health care and consistent with the values of the profession through individual and collective action. 7. The nurse participates in the advancement of the pro- fession through contributions to practice, education, admin-istration, and knowledge development. 8. The nurse collaborates with other health professionals and the public in promoting community, national, and inter-national efforts to meet health needs. 9. The profession of nursing, as represented by associa- tions and their members, is responsible for articulating nurs-ing values, for maintaining the integrity of the profession and its practice, and for shaping social policy.Code of Ethics for Nurses The American Nurses Association's \"Code of Ethics for Nurses\" provides ethical standards of conduct and guidelines for all aspects of nursing practice.

describes the diverse groups in society, which have varying races and national ori- gins, religious af liations, languages, physical size, gender, sexual orientation, age, disabilities, socio- economic status, occupational status, and geographic location Differences are based on ideology and values Ideology refers to a group's opinions or ways of thinking Values refers to a group's norms, customs, ideas, and behaviors The nurse brings her personal cultural heritage along with cultural and philosophical views into the clinical setting The nurse-patient encounters includes the interaction of three cultural systems: the cultural system of the nurse, of the patient and family, and of the setting /H18546Sensitivity to cultures Several factors may affect sensitivity to other cultures Stereotyping occurs when an individual assumes that all members of a culture or ethnic group act alike Stereotyping may be positive or negative Negative stereotyping includes racism, ageism, and sexism\u2014beliefs that a certain race, age group, or gender is inherently superior to others\u2014leading to discrimination against those considered inferior Positive stereotyping can be just as harmful as negative stereotyping; it can include such state- ments as \"Asians are good at math,\" \"Italians are great cooks,\" or \"Native Americans are spiritual\" /H18546Cultural sensitivity in nursing care To be able to provide culturally competent care to people from diverse backgrounds, the nurse must be sensitive to culturally diverse needs, characteristics, and values of individuals, families, and groups To provide effective nursing care, the nurse should deliver care with respect for any and all cultural beliefs and practices of the patient and family The incorporation of the nurse's own cultural diversity experiences and awareness brings compe- tency to everyday practice Culturally sensitive care acknowledges the impact that a patient's cultural norms or beliefs may have on wellness, treatment of illnesses, causes of disease, and de nitions of health and wellness Ethnocentrism, or the belief that one's own cultural values and beliefs are superior or the only correct values and beliefs, can interfere with the delivery of effective nursing care The nurse must at all times be sensitive to the beliefs and values of those in her care and understand how beliefs and values infl uence healing and health care practices The broad range of cultural diversity requires the nurse to be sensitive to and have a willingness to learn about the values and norms of those in her care Inquiry and active listening can help both the nurse and the patient and family meet expectations Organ donation /H18546Uniform Anatomical Gift Act This legislation was approved in 1968 by

/H18546Organ collection For most organs\u2014such as the heart, liver, kidney, and pancreas\u2014the patient must be pronounced brain dead and kept physically alive until the organs are harvested Such tissue as the eyes, skin, bone, and heart valves may be taken after death /H18546Nursing interventions Follow your facility's policy for identifying and reporting a potential organ donor Contact your local regional OPO when a potential donor is identi ed Typically, a specially trained person from your facility along with someone from your regional OPO will speak with the family about organ donation The OPO coordinates the donation process after a family consents to donation Health care regulation and policies /H18546Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (formerly the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research) AHRQ works collaboratively with the public and private sectors to improve quality and safety of patient care As part of the DHHS, AHRQ supports research designed to improve the quality of health care, advance the use of information systems, reduce health care costs, improve patient safety, decrease medical errors, and broaden access to essential services AHRQ supports the development of evidence reports through its 12 evidence-based practice centers and the dissemination of evidence-based guidelines through the AHRQ's National Guideline Clearinghouse /H18546Reimbursement Reimbursement for health care services involves numerous plans (private and governmental), meth- ods of coverage, and options depending on an individual's income, employment status, and age Each type of plan differs in coverage, payment terms, medical treatment procedures, and choice of health care providers Common types of private plans include indemnity plans, preferred provider organizations (PPOs), health maintenance organizations (HMOs), and point-of-service (POS) plans An indemnity, or fee-for-service, plan allows the individual to use any health care facility or practitioner The individual submits a claim, and the insurance company reimburses him or the health care provider Indemnity plans are fl exible but carry higher premiums than other types of health coverage Typically, the individual must meet a deductible before reimbursement begins A PPO provides a network of hospitals, practitioners, and clinics that discount their fees to insur- ance companies in exchange for being part of a network If an individual chooses to use a provider outside the network, he'll most likely pay a higher deductible This type of plan is typically less expensive but doesn't offer the fl exibility of an indemnity plan An HMO is a network of providers that deliver all the medical services an individual requires Except in emergencies, any use of health care providers outside the HMO must be authorized by the HMO, or services may not be reimbursed HMOs don't require the individual to pay a deductible, but most do require a small co-payment POS is an HMO option whereby the primary health care provider may refer an individual to a health care provider outside the HMO network with minimal or no additional cost Med-Surg_Chap03.indd 32 Med-Surg_Chap03.indd 32 8/2/2011 2:44:52 PM 8/2/2011 2:44:52 PMHealth care regulation and policies 33 Government reimbursement programs include Medicare and Medicaid The CMS is the federal agency that provides health insurance through Medicare and Medicaid Medicare, authorized by Congress in 1965, is a federal health insurance plan for people age 65 or older, some disabled people younger than age 65, and people with end-stage renal disease Part A of Medicare pays for hospital care, skilled nursing facility care, hospice care, and some skilled nursing home care for most people when they turn age 65; it is funded by Medicare taxes Part B pays for practitioners, services, outpatient hospital care, and some other medical services not covered in part A, such as physical and occupational therapy, and some home health care and supplies; part B requires most enrollees to apply monthly Part C\u2014In 1997, Congress created Medicare Advantage (Part C), formerly known as Medicare + Choice. Individuals with Medicare Parts A and B can choose to receive all of their health care through one of these provider organizations such as HMOs, PPOs, POS, or private fee-for-service plans Part D\u2014Individuals with Medicare, regardless of income, health status, or prescription drug usage, have access to prescription drug coverage Medicaid became a law in 1965 under Title XIX of the Social Security Act to provide medical care to eligible needy individuals Medicaid is jointly funded by the federal and state governments to assist states in the provision of adequate medical care to needy individuals The Medicaid program varies considerably state to state and within each state over time /H18546Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) In 1970, Congress approved the Occupational Safety and Health Act that placed safety and health enforcement under the federal agency called OSHA OSHA ensures compliance of standards through an inspection program, with penalties for violations OSHA established the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to conduct research and training in occupational safety and health in workplaces covered by OSHA /H18546The Joint Commission The Joint Commission is an independent, nonpro t organization It sets standards in areas such as patient rights, patient safety, health care provider credentialing, management of human resources, management of information, leadership and management, perfor-mance improvement, utilization management, emergency care, and environmental protection It also evaluates health care organizations\u2014such as hospitals (including general, psychiatric, pedi- atric, and rehabilitation), health care networks, home care agencies, long-term care facilities, assisted living residences, behavioral health care organizations, ambulatory care providers, and clinical laboratories\u2014in those areas and then grants or denies accreditation Health care organizations that don't receive Joint Commission accreditation don't receive reimburse- ment from insurance companies and Medicare /H18546Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) In 1996, Congress approved HIPAA, which is intended to limit the ability of employers to deny employees with preexisting medical conditions health insurance coverage In 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) included new changes to HIPAA standards; the changes expand HIPAA's coverage and strengthen its protection For a health care provider or health care organization, covered entities include all employees, includ- ing clinical staff members\u2014such as physicians, nurses, and technicians\u2014as well as nonclinical staff members, such as employees working in registration, billing, housekeeping, and food services; ARRA updates may also include nonemployees (such as volunteers) in this de nition /H18546Privacy rules The DHHS has developed privacy rules that include, but are not limited to, electronic medi- cal records (EMRs); these privacy rules apply to all health care providers who transmit information electronically and prohibit the release of personal health information (PHI) without permission Med-Surg_Chap03.indd 33 Med-Surg_Chap03.indd 33 8/2/2011 2:44:52 PM 8/2/2011 2:44:52 PM34 Legal and ethical aspects of nursing PHI is any information that can be used to identify an individual patient; examples of PHI include a patient's name, date of birth, social security number, medical record number, address, diagnosis, license numbers, photographs, and other speci c account numbers Volunteers of a health care facility as well as business associates\u2014such as contracted staff members\u2014 are expected to protect the privacy and security of health information as if they were employees The National Alliance for Healthcare Information Technology de nes an EMR as the health-related information of an individual that is created, gathered, managed, and consulted by licensed clinicians and staff members from a single organization who are involved in that individual's health and care The EMR can be created in both ambulatory services (of ces and off-site facilities) and health care facilities The electronic heath record is a combined electronic record of health-related information on an indi- vidual that's created and gathered cumulatively across more than one health care organization and is managed and consulted by licensed clinicians and staff members involved in the individual's health and care De-identi ed Information refers to any health or health care information that doesn't reveal a patient's commonly identi able information (including information that could identify him through his relatives, household members, and employers), such as a case study presented at a conference that uses a ctitious name in place of the patient's real name; this information isn't protected by privacy rules, so there are no limits on the use of this type of information Disclosure is the act of sharing information; HIPAA de nes disclosure as \"the release, transfer, provision of access to, or divulging in any other manner of information outside the entity holding the information\" There are two types of disclosure In authorized disclosure , the patient gives written permission to disclose information for uses outside of treatment, payment, and operations In unauthorized disclosure , no written authorization is received Protecting the privacy of PHI and following privacy rules is the responsibility of everyone at a health care facility, regardless of an individual's role; it's not intended to get in the way of providing quality care to patients or meeting patients' other needs To ensure following privacy rules while working, the nurse should ask herself three questions Do I need this information to treat this patient? Do I need this information to bill this patient? Do I need this information to do other hospital-related business? If the answer to all three questions is \"no,\" then the nurse doesn't need the information and shouldn't be accessing or asking for it Exceptions to disclosing PHI include required public health reporting; disasters or situations of imminent danger; reporting abuse of children, the elderly, or protected populations; and other state-speci c required reporting, such as knife or gunshot wounds EMRs pose special challenges and require safeguards to ensure that information remains private The health care facility should ensure that each employee's computer password allows him access to only the information he needs to do his job Employees should position computer screens away from visitors and use privacy screens when- ever possible Employees shouldn't share or post passwords Employees should log out of computers immediately after each use Health care facilities should make sure all computers automatically log users out after a set period of inactivity Health care facilities should limit fax machine access to only those who need the information being faxed and should use preprogrammed numbers whenever possible to reduce the risk of incorrect dialing Med-Surg_Chap03.indd 34 Med-Surg_Chap03.indd 34 8/2/2011 2:44:52 PM 8/2/2011 2:44:52 PMReview questions 35 Review questions 1. The nurse leaves a patient who is elderly and confused to nd someone to assist with transferring the patient to bed. While the nurse is gone, the patient falls and hurts herself. The nurse is at fault because she hasn't: /H18540A. properly educated the patient about safety measures. /H18540B. restrained the patient. /H18540C. documented that she left the patient. /H18540D. arranged for continual care of the patient. Correct answer: D By leaving the patient, the nurse is at fault for abandonment. The better courses of action are to turn on the call bell or elicit help on the way to the patient's room. Options A and C are incorrect because neither excuses the nurse from her responsibility for ensuring the patient's safety. Option B is incorrect because restraints are only to be used as a last resort, when all other alternatives for ensuring patient safety have been tried and have failed; moreover, restraints won't ensure the patient's safety. 2. The nurse is caring for a patient admitted to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident. Under the law, the nurse must obtain informed consent before treatment unless the patient: /H18540A. is mentally ill. /H18540B. refuses to give informed consent. /H18540C. is in an emergency situation. /H18540D. asks the nurse to give substituted consent. Correct answer: C The law doesn't require informed consent in an emergency situation when the patient can't give consent and no next of kin is available. Option A is incorrect because even though a patient who is declared mentally incompetent can't give informed consent, mental illness doesn't by itself indicate that the patient is incompetent to give such consent. Option B is incorrect because a mentally competent patient may refuse or revoke consent at any time. Option D is incorrect because although the nurse may act as a patient advocate, the nurse can never give substituted consent. 3. Which of the following acts committed by a nurse is an intentional tort? /H18540A. Battery /H18540B. Breach of con dentiality /H18540C. Negligence /H18540D. Abandonment Correct answer: A Battery, touching a patient without justi cation or permission, is an intentional tort. Option B is incorrect because although a nurse who breaches a patient's con dentiality can be subject to a lawsuit or disciplinary action, the act isn't an intentional tort. Option C is incorrect because negligence, the failure to exercise the degree of care that a person of ordinary prudence would exercise under the same circumstances, is an unintentional tort. Option D is incorrect because although abandonment is a liability for nurses, the act isn't an intentional tort. Med-Surg_Chap03.indd 35 Med-Surg_Chap03.indd 35 8/2/2011 2:44:52 PM 8/2/2011 2:44:52 PM36 Legal and ethical aspects of nursing 4. OSHA is responsible for: /H18540A. compensating workers injured in the workplace. /H18540B. providing rehabilitation for workers injured in the workplace. /H18540C. inspecting high-hazard workplaces for compliance with protective standards. /H18540D. disciplining workers injured in the workplace. Correct answer: C OSHA is responsible for preventing work-related injuries, illnesses, and deaths. Options A and B are incorrect because it's the responsibility of workers' compensation to compensate workers for injuries occurring in the workplace and to provide rehabilitative services. Option D is incor-rect because it's the employer's responsibility to improve the safety and health of employees. Employers who violate OSHA standards are subject to nes and penalties. 5. A patient became seriously ill after a nurse gave him the wrong medication. After his recovery, he led a lawsuit. Who is most likely to be held liable? /H18540A. No one because it was an accident /H18540B. The hospital /H18540C. The nurse /H18540D. The nurse and the hospital Correct answer: D Nurses are always responsible for their actions. The hospital is liable for negligent conduct of its employees within the scope of employment. Consequently, the nurse and the hospital are liable. Therefore, Options B and C are incorrect. Option A is incorrect because although the mistake wasn't intentional, standard procedure wasn't followed. 6. Which of the following is incorrect about informed consent? /H18540A. It can be revoked by the state, especially when the bene ts outweigh the risks. /H18540B. A person has to be mentally competent to sign an informed consent. /H18540C. Physicians can waive informed consents in emergency situations. /H18540D. The name of the procedure, its risks and bene ts, and other alternative procedures make up all the essential elements of informed consent. Correct answer: D An informed consent should also contain the name of the health care professional who will be performing the procedure. The other options are correct statements about informed consent. 7. Which of the following is considered identi able health information? /H18540A. A photograph of a patient's leg showing a unique tattoo /H18540B. A patient's chart listing his history of a stroke last year /H18540C. A blank menu for a regular diet on the patient's over-bed table /H18540D. A laboratory report with the patient's name, address, Social Security number, date of birth, and room number deleted Correct Answer: A Any information that can identify the person or that relates to a past, present, or future physical or mental condition is considered identi able health information. Options B, C, and D don't contain information that can identify the patient. Med-Surg_Chap03.indd 36 Med-Surg_Chap03.indd 36 8/2/2011 2:44:52 PM 8/2/2011 2:44:52 PMReview questions 37 8. In a negligence suit against a nurse, what must the plaintiff prove? /H18540A. The nurse intended to cause harm. /H18540B. The nurse's actions caused harm. /H18540C. The nurse knew she caused harm. /H18540D. The nurse was sorry for causing harm. Correct answer: B In a negligence suit, the plaintiff must prove that the nurse's actions caused harm to the patient. He doesn't need to prove that the nurse intended to cause harm (Option A), knew she caused harm (Option C), or was sorry she caused harm (Option D). 9. A nurse failed to administer a medication to a patient according to accepted standards. Consequently, the patient suffered adverse effects. Failure to provide patient care and to follow appropriate standards is called: /H18540A. breach of duty. /H18540B. breach of contract. /H18540C. battery. /H18540D. tort. Correct answer: A Breach of duty means that the nurse provided care that didn't meet the accepted standard. When investigating breach of duty, the court asks: How would a reasonable, prudent nurse with comparable training and experience have acted in comparable circumstances? A breach of contract (Option B) results when one party fails to perform as required by a contract. Battery (Option C) is touch-ing a patient without justi cation or permission. A tort (Option D) is a civil action for damages for injury to a person, property, or reputation. 10. The belief that one's own cultural values and beliefs are superior or the only correct values and beliefs is: /H18540A. cultural competency. /H18540B. cultural diversity. /H18540C. ethnocentrism. /H18540D. cultural sensitivity. Correct answer: C Ethnocentrism is the belief that one's own cultural values and beliefs are superior or the only correct values and beliefs. Cultural competency (Option A) is the ability to work and interact effectively with people of other cultures. Cultural diversity (Option B) describes the diverse groups in society, which have varying races and national origins, religious af liations, languages, physical size, gender, sexual orientation, age, disabilities, socioeconomic status, occupational status, and geographic location. Cultural sensitivity (Option D) is the understanding of the diverse needs, characteristics, and values of individuals, families, and groups.

he posited that an individual must meet each level before he can move on to the next level Maslow's hierarchy consists of ve basic levels Physiological needs are a person's most basic needs and must be met; these biological needs include oxygen, food, water, shelter, and freedom from pain At the next level, a person needs safety and security , including protection and freedom from harm or threatened deprivation The next level of need is love, affection, and belonging , when a person seeks to overcome feelings of loneliness and alienation; this stage carries the need for enduring intimacy, friendship, and acceptance and includes both giving and receiving of love and affection At the next level, the person tries to meet esteem needs and self-respect When a person successfully meets these needs, he feels self-con dent and valuable as a person When a person doesn't meet these needs, he feels inferior, helpless, and worthless At the top level of self-actualization , the person meets the need of doing what he was \"born to do\"; this level includes the need for beauty, truth, and justice Traumatic life circumstances or compromised health can cause a person to regress to a lower level of motivation Death and dying /H18546General information Many factors infl uence an adult's views of death: ethnic, social, and cultural background; religious beliefs; personal values; previous experiences with death; and developmental stage Young- and middle-aged adults usually spend little time considering the possibility of their own death; they view it as an intrusion or an injustice and are most concerned with who will take care of their family if they should die Older adults begin to consider the possibility of death and tend to view it as a phase of life; although some older adults welcome death as freedom from pain, others fear dying alone or suffering needlessly /H18546Responses to death Each person responds to death in his own way; there are no right or wrong responses The circumstances of a death can infl uence a person's response Sudden, unexpected deaths may be harder to accept than those that have been anticipated for some time A premature death, such as that of a child, is harder to accept than that of an elderly person Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross described a typical pattern of response to death (see Dealing with death and dying, page 42) Assessment /H18546General information A nursing assessment includes a comprehensive health history, thorough physical examination, and (when applicable) review of diagnostic test results Med-Surg_Chap04.indd 39 Med-Surg_Chap04.indd 39 8/2/2011 2:45:46 PM 8/2/2011 2:45:46 PM40 Principles of medical-surgical nursing As adults age, they enter different stages of physical, cognitive, and psychosocial development and face various challenges and health problems and concerns. Development Challenges Health problems and concerns Y oung adulthood (ages 18 to 35) Physical By his mid-20s, a person reaches adult height, and body systems are fully developed. Young adults are at peak physical strength, maximum physiologic reserve, and prime reproductive capability. Cognitive With stimulation, young adults continue to develop their intellectual abilities. Psychosocial The key confl ict is \"intimacy versus isolation.\" Young adults struggle to form commitments without losing their identity. With positive resolution, the young adult develops satisfying, intimate relationships. With negative resolution, the young adult becomes self-absorbed and focuses only on his own needs. Selecting and preparing for a vocation Becoming nancially independent Establishing a new living arrangement Managing a home Selecting a marriage partner Choosing an alternative lifestyle such as homosexuality Developing a satisfactory sex life Becoming a parent and raising children Finding a congenial social group Assuming civic responsibilitiesHealth problems Childbirth or infertility Substance abuse Stress and stress-related illnesses such as peptic ulcer disease Sexually transmitted diseases Accidents and injuries Health concerns (when illness occurs) Loss of independence and disruption of lifestyle Disruption of employment and loss of employment bene ts such as health insurance Decreased self-esteem Middle adulthood (ages 36 to 65) Physical Middle-aged adults experience a slow decline in body functions. The rate of decline varies greatly and is affected by heredity, diet, exercise, rest, and stress. Typical physical changes include hair thinning and graying, skin wrinkling, diminished eyesight and hearing, menopause, decreased metabolism, weight gain, decreased strength and endurance, loss of bone mass and density, muscle and joint stiffness, and decreased libido. Cognitive Intellectual performance remains relatively stable. Psychosocial The key confl ict in middle age is \"generativity versus stagnation.\" Middle-aged adults need to be productive and accept responsibility for their family, work, and community. With positive resolution, the middle-aged adult is productive and satis ed with life. With negative resolution, the middle-aged adult becomes egocentric, stagnant, and dissatis ed. Maintaining satisfactory employment Preparing for retirement Adjusting to the physical changes of middle age Developing satisfying relationships with grown children, friends, and other adults Helping children become responsible, happy adults Resolving the empty-nest crisis as children leave home Becoming a grandparent Relating to aging parents Developing leisure activities Maintaining social and civic responsibilitiesHealth problems Chronic diseases (such as arthritis, hypertension, coronary artery disease, osteoporosis, diabetes, and lung disease) and depression, anxiety, or other emotional problems Cancer, particularly of the lung, breast, colon, rectum, and prostate Substance abuse Accidents and injuries Health concerns Loss of job and employment bene ts such as health insurance Awareness of mortality and fear of early death Ability to meet commitments to children, aging parents, and community Concerns about retirement and retirement bene tsStages of adult development PM 8/2/2011 2:45:46 PMAssessment 41 Development Challenges Health problems and concerns Older adulthood (age 66 and older) Physical The maximum life span is typically age 110; the average is age 80. The body systems of older adults function adequately unless stressed, which taxes their decreased physiologic reserves. Older adults experience decreased strength, endurance, cardiac output, vital capacity, GI motility, and skin elasticity and secretions; weakened muscles and joints; bone and muscle loss; diminished eyesight and hearing; and altered renal function. Cognitive Intellectual abilities generally remain stable. Normal changes include increased response time and minor short-term memory loss; other cognitive changes warrant investigation. Psychosocial The key confl ict in older adulthood is \"integrity versus despair.\" Older adults focus on a life review and acceptance of the worth of their life. With positive resolution, the older adult is satis ed with his accomplishments. With negative resolution, the older adult has feelings of hopelessness, regret, and despair. Adjusting to retirement and an altered nancial situation Maintaining satisfactory housing arrangements Adjusting to the death of a spouse, family members, and friends Adjusting to decreased physical strength Adjusting to declining health Adjusting to mental changes and short-term memory loss Maintaining social relationships Finding leisure activitiesHealth problems Chronic diseases (especially arthritis, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease, glaucoma, benign prostatic hyperplasia, pneumonia, and other respiratory disease), fractures, and cataracts Greater susceptibility to adverse drug reactions Longer recovery from illness Vague or atypical symptoms of illness Health concerns Loss of functional abilities Disruption of current lifestyle and living arrangementsStages of adult development (continued ) A thorough, accurate nursing assessment is critical in determining appropriate nursing diagnoses /H18546Health history Excellent communication techniques and interviewing skills are the key to obtaining a good health history The nurse begins the history by obtaining biographic data: name, address, age, date of birth, sex, race, marital status, education, occupation, and nancial status The nurse then determines the patient's chief complaint or reason for seeking health care Next, the nurse obtains a history of current illness, including a description of the symptom's location, duration, frequency, intensity, precipitating factors, and relieving factors The nurse continues by ascertaining a personal history The personal history includes childhood illnesses and childhood and recent immunizations It also includes questions about disorders, such as allergies, heart disease, and diabetes; accidents; and emotional problems or mental illness It investigates prior hospitalizations, surgery, and transfusions It assesses work history, including occupational exposure to toxins or other harmful substances If the patient is female, it addresses age at menarche, age at menopause, and pregnancy history The personal history evaluates lifestyle and health habits, including sexual orientation and activity; alcohol and tobacco use; diet; over-the-counter, herbal, and recreational drug use; and Med-Surg_Chap04.indd of medical-surgical nursing Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross discovered that most people pass through ve stages in response to death and dying. Although some individuals experience the stages in a different order and others revisit some stages, knowledge of these stages can help the nurse evaluate\u2014and deal with\u2014a patient's responses to death and dying. Stages of death and dying 1. Denial and isolation: the initial response characterized by shock and disbelief 2. Anger: expressions of rage and resentment 3. Bargaining: attempts to strike a bargain, typically with God, in exchange for prolonged life 4. Depression: feelings of loss, grief, and intense sadness 5. Acceptance: a quiet stage characterized by a gradual, peaceful withdrawal from life Nursing implications For a dying patient's psychosocial and spiritual needs Help the patient make nal plans. Help the patient control personal routines and affairs as long as possible. Provide opportunities for reminiscence and validation of self-worth. Support the patient's expression of dif cult feelings. Use touch as a communication tool, if acceptable to the patient. Provide for formal spiritual support, such as clergy visits or last rites.For a dying patient's physical needs Regularly perform routine personal care measures, such as turning, positioning, bathing, and grooming. Be alert for constipation, a common problem. Anticipate bowel and bladder incontinence as death nears. Be sensitive to individual preferences for lighting and noise control. Use pain medications and comfort measures as needed to maintain patient comfort. Offer favorite liquids and soft foods; appetite wanes as death nears. Remember that hearing is the last sense to be lost.For family members' psychosocial and spiritual needs Allow fl exible visitations. Encourage family members to participate in patient care. Recommend rest breaks for family members. Visit the patient regularly, and perform routine personal care activities while family members are present. Encourage the family to personalize the patient's room. Provide for bereavement follow-up. Recognize the need for formal counseling in dif cult situations. Encourage the use of support groups when available.Dealing with death and dying It explores prescription medication use Then the nurse obtains a family history It ascertains the ages of the patient's parents and the number, sex, and age of siblings It also inquires about a family history of various diseases and emotional problems or mental illness The nurse concludes the history with a review of physical status General: Assess overall health status, malaise, fatigue, chills and fever, night sweats, recent weight gain or loss, and increased sensitivity to heat or cold Skin, hair, and nails: Ask about skin disease or rash, urticaria, acne, psoriasis, alopecia, hirsutism, pigmentation changes, jaundice, and increased skin dryness or moisture Head: Inquire about trauma, headache, vertigo, syncope, and change in level of consciousness (LOC) Eyes: Investigate visual acuity, use of glasses or contact lenses, photophobia, diplopia, night blindness, nystagmus, eye infections, eye pain, and halos around lights Ears: Assess tinnitus, ear infections, ear pain, ear discharge, loss of hearing, use of hearing aids, and occupational or lifestyle exposure to damaging sounds Nose: Ask about problems with smell, frequent colds, sinus infections or pain, and epistaxis Mouth: Have the patient discuss condition of the teeth, use of dentures or partial plates, bleeding or swollen gums, frequent sore throats, hoarseness, and dif Neck: Cardiovascular: Inquire about edema, dyspnea, orthopnea, number of pillows needed when supine, cough, chest pain, intermittent claudication, hypertension, palpitations, anemia, varicosities, and results of the last electrocardiogram and blood cholesterol levels Respiratory: Learn about any dry or productive cough, color of sputum, hemoptysis, dyspnea, wheezing, and last chest X-ray GI: Discuss dietary intake, polyphagia, polydipsia, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, bowel habits, diarrhea, constipation, change in stool color, blood or mucus in stool, fl atulence, hemorrhoids, location and intensity of abdominal pain, jaundice, and ascites Genitourinary: Check into nocturia, frequency, burning, stream, hesitancy, pain, dribbling, polyuria, and incontinence Musculoskeletal: Assess for joint pain or stiffness, decreased mobility, edema, and heat or tenderness Neurologic: Ask about seizures, headaches, fainting spells, decreased LOC, paresis or paralysis, paresthesia, aphasia, tremor, head injuries, and loss of memory Mental status: Inquire about mood swings, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and suicidal ideation Reproductive Male: Ask about testicular self-examination, penile discharge, sexually transmitted diseases, sexual activity, safer sex practices (such as the use of latex condoms with spermicide and having one known partner), impotence, and infertility Female: Inquire about age of menarche;

breast self-examination; and last mammogram /H18546Physical examination To perform an effective physical examination, the nurse must be pro cient in the following techniques Inspection uses the senses of sight and smell to observe the patient, such as when the nurse observes a patient's gait or smells a fruity odor on the patient's breath Palpation uses the sense of touch to gather data, such as when the nurse takes a radial pulse or feels the breasts for lumps Percussion involves striking one object against another to generate a vibration that produces an audible sound wave, such as when the nurse taps over clear lung elds (resonance), a body organ (dullness), or an air- lled stomach (tympany) Auscultation uses the sense of hearing to listen for sounds, usually with a stethoscope, produced by body organs, such as when the nurse takes an apical pulse or listens over the carotid artery for a bruit The nurse usually conducts the physical examination from head to toe and from least to most sensi- tive areas The nurse begins with a general assessment Check height, weight, and vital signs Observe general appearance and grooming, breath and body odor, overall mental state, posture, and ability to move Next, the nurse examines the head Note condition of scalp and hair and distribution of hair Note head size and contour and facial symmetry Then the nurse checks the eyes Check visual acuity, visual elds, and extraocular movements Note condition of conjunctivae, sclerae, and eyebrows Check pupil size and reaction to light and corneal refl ex Examine the retinas using an ophthalmoscope The nurse continues by assessing the ears Med-Surg_Chap04.indd 43 Med-Surg_Chap04.indd 43 8/2/2011 2:45:47 PM 8/2/2011 2:45:47 PM44 Principles of medical-surgical nursing Observe ear size, shape, and position Examine the tympanic membrane with an otoscope, noting color, landmarks, external canal condition, and any wax or foreign bodies Conduct hearing screening tests - For the Weber test, hold a vibrating tuning fork at the middle of the patient's forehead, and check for equal distribution of sound; the sound should be equal on both sides; lateralization indicates abnormality - For the Rinne test, hold a vibrating tuning fork over the mastoid process; when the vibration stops, place the tuning fork near the external ear; the patient should still be able to hear the vibration Then the nurse assesses the nose Observe nares for patency, appearance, and septal deviation Test for sinus tenderness and the ability to discriminate smells The nurse examines the mouth and throat next Note condition of the teeth and use of dentures or partial plates Observe mucous membranes, tongue, tonsils, and pharynx Determine the patient's ability to discriminate different tastes Test for the gag refl ex and ability to move the uvula Palpate the lymph nodes The nurse evaluates the neck Observe for mobility Palpate thyroid for size and shape Palpate trachea for midline placement Auscultate for carotid bruits The assesses the heart Inspect for visible pulsations and jugular vein distention Palpate for point of maximal impulse at the fth intercostal space, at the midclavicular line Palpate for thrills or ventricular heave Auscultate heart sounds and assess apical pulse for rate, rhythm, and quality The nurse also assesses the lungs Inspect chest for size, shape, and symmetrical excursion Note use of accessory muscles Palpate for symmetrical excursion and tactile fremitus Auscultate for breath sounds Next, the nurse checks the breasts Observe for symmetry, dimpling, or retraction Palpate for masses and palpable lymph nodes Then the nurse evaluates the abdomen Inspect for size, contour, and scars Auscultate all quadrants for bowel sounds Percuss for tympany and area of dullness at liver margin Palpate for tenderness or masses; the liver, spleen, and kidneys normally aren't palpable The nurse assesses the musculoskeletal system Note symmetry, alignment, and joint range of motion Palpate for tenderness, muscle tone, and crepitus in joints The nurse also assesses the nervous system Note LOC, orientation, speech, and gait Check deep tendon and plantar refl exes Check sensory perceptions of pain, touch, position, vibration, and temperature Test cranial nerve function Med-Surg_Chap04.indd 44 Med-Surg_Chap04.indd 44 8/2/2011 2:45:47 PM 8/2/2011 2:45:47 PMTherapeutic communication 45 Test motor system for muscle tone and strength The nurse then examines the genitalia For a male patient, inspect general appearance, circumcision (if any), pubic hair distribution, urethral opening, scars, swelling, and discharge; also palpate for tenderness, descended testicles, masses, swelling, and palpable inguinal lymph nodes For a female patient, inspect external genitalia and pubic hair distribution, check vaginal mucosa and cervix with a speculum, and perform bimanual examination of uterus and ovaries Finally, the nurse assesses the rectum Inspect for hemorrhoids and ssures Note stool color Palpate rectum for shape, tenderness, and internal hemorrhoids; for male patient, palpate poste- rior prostate for symmetry and tenderness Therapeutic communication /H18546General information Therapeutic communication is as important for a medical-surgical nurse as for a psychiatric and mental health nurse A therapeutic relationship facilitates application of the nursing process and is based on the patient's needs It focuses on the patient; personal issues that interfere with a nurse's ability to relate to a patient must be resolved through peer supervision or counseling It's infl uenced by the nurse's style of interaction (see Interaction styles affecting therapeutic communi- cation, page 46) /H18546Uses of therapeutic communication Therapeutic communication enhances the patient's coping skills by helping the patient become an integral part of the treatment plan, actively participate in recovery, and try new health-promoting behaviors It decreases patient defensiveness by building a trusting nurse-patient relationship; it also helps the nurse identify health problems, such as substance abuse, and promotes cooperation with nursing interventions It can clarify issues, which reduces misunderstandings and facilitates the design of an individualized care plan It can promote healing (see Therapeutic communication techniques for medical-surgical nursing, page 47) /H18546Types of messages Constructive messages con rm the patient's importance, keep the lines of communication open, and allow for further data collection; examples include \"What would you like from me?\" \"What do you think about...?\" and \"I can see you're in pain; let's talk about your options for managing it\" Destructive messages negate the patient's importance, close the lines of communication, and put all parties on the defensive; examples include \"The doctor ordered this,\" \"There are other patients on this fl oor besides you,\" and \"We're doing the best we can\" /H18546Patient perceptions Patients are affected not only by what they know about their situation but also by how they perceive it Therapeutic communication allows the nurse to assess the patient's knowledge of his condition; examples include \"What's your understanding of your condition?\" \"What have you been told about your condition?\" and \"What questions do you have about your condition?\" Therapeutic communication allows the nurse to assess how the patient perceives his condition; examples include \"What are your thoughts about what's happening to you?\" \"How does this illness affect your life?\" and \"Based on your condition, what do you anticipate Med-Surg_Chap04.indd Principles of medical-surgical nursing Defensive style Nurses who interact defensively have an intense need to be perfect and feel a need to justify everything. They're closed, they withhold information, and they don't risk exposing per-sonal vulnerabilities. They tend to blame their patients and feel frustrated when the patients don't \"measure up.\" This interaction style can produce anxiety, defensiveness, fatigue, guilt, frustration, and burnout. Sympathetic style Nurses who interact sympathetically have poor boundaries and can't clearly separate their own emotional responses from the patient's needs and wants. Sympathizers tend to project their own feelings onto others. They take on others' burdens as their own and feel a need to make everything turn out right. They experience a sense of personal failure if the patient's problem isn't resolved. This interaction style can cause an emotional outfl ow of energy, emotional exhaustion, and a sense of futility. Holistic style Nurses who interact holistically have healthy ego boundar-ies: They understand what belongs to their patients and what belongs to them. Holistic nurses provide an atmos-phere for patient growth and allow it to happen in whatever manner is meaningful to their patients. This interaction style can lead to self-awareness, cen- teredness, differentiation of nurse and patient needs, con-trolled energy outfl ow, vitality, tranquility, and satisfaction.Interaction styles affecting therapeutic communication Interaction styles range from defensive to sympathetic to holistic. To enhance therapeutic communication, the nurse should strive to achieve a holistic style. Therapeutic communication lets the nurse assess how the patient feels about his health; examples include \"How do you feel about your condition?\" and \"On a scale of 1 to 5, how comfortable are you with knowing that you have...?\" /H18546Steps to therapeutic communication Respect privacy Convey unconditional positive regard; patients need to feel valued no matter how they look or act Choose words carefully; the use of why can sound accusatory, and other words can hinder self-disclosure Use an appropriate sequence of questions First, ask for descriptions; for example, \"Tell me about the pain\" Second, ask what the patient thinks about the situation; for example, \"What do you think this pain is all about?\" Third, ask the patient how he feels about the situation; for example, \"How do you feel about having this pain?\" Use the nursing process in a culturally relevant way Assess the patient's health beliefs and practices to avoid misunderstandings and noncompliance Formulate a culturally relevant etiology statement in the nursing diagnosis to allow development of individualized care plans Devise plans or goals that are compatible with the patient's values; incompatible plans will frustrate the patient and the nurse Use culturally relevant interventions; whenever possible, interweave the patient's usual health practices with scienti c health practices Evaluate outcomes within the context of the patient's background Establish a therapeutic environment Address the reality of the patient's experience If a patient asks, \"Am I going to die?\" an appropriate nursing response is \"Tell me why you're asking that question\" Avoid responses that close off exploration, such as \"You'll have to ask your doctor\" or \"Yes, you know your illness is communication 47 The medical-surgical nurse can use various techniques to achieve therapeutic communication. Technique Description Example Broad opening General statement or question designed to encourage the patient to talk about whatever is most important at the momentPatient (in bed): \"Hello.\" Nurse: Seeking validation for what was said Nurse: \"What do you mean when you say...?\" or \"You're awfully quiet today. What's going on?\" Concreteness Seeking further information by asking how, what, where, when, and who, which helps the nurse gather more information and helps the patient become more objective about a situationPatient: you feel bad.\" Confrontation Calling the patients' attention to discrepancies in their communication patterns or discrepancies between what they say and doPatient: \"I don't have any concerns about...\" Nurse: \"You say you aren't concerned, but I notice your muscles are tense\" or \"You say you don't have any concerns, yet you've asked me the same question four times.\" Empathy Putting yourself temporarily in another's positionPatient: \"I should never have agreed to this surgery.\" Nurse: \"Sounds like you're having second thoughts.\" Focusing Helping the patient direct attention to something speci cPatient: \"This is so complicated, I don't know where to begin. How will I ever learn how to take care of...\"Nurse: \"For now, I want you to concentrate on...\" Refl ection Paraphrasing what the patient has said Patient: \"I'm useless. I can't even scratch my own nose.\"Nurse: \"You're convinced you'll never be able to do anything for yourself.\" Silence Refraining from speech to gather information, collect personal thoughts, or give the patient an opportunity to speak when readyPatient: \"It's so awful to lose your husband\" (weeps vigorously).Nurse: remains quietly with the patient but doesn't try to take away the patient's pain.Therapeutic communication techniques for medical-surgical nursing Provide patients with the information that they need about their condition and the health care system Tell patients what to expect from the system and the nurse, and explain what's expected of them Tell them who has access to information about their condition Inform them of the unit rules Explain procedures and medications Provide the names of personnel associated with their care Empower patients Include them in care conferences Ask them what they think of the care plan, what they want the nurse to know about them, and what they expect from the nurse Anticipate patients' needs Begin discharge planning when a patient enters care, and include signi cant others in the planning Med-Surg_Chap04.indd 47 Med-Surg_Chap04.indd 2:45:47 PM of medical-surgical nursing Provide written materials; most patients are moderately anxious and comprehend only fragments of information at a time Allow for privacy and space needs Conserve patients' energy for healing; don't expect or require them to do more than is realistic Don't wait for patients to tell you of their needs such as a need for pain medication; ask about their needs regularly Arrange for diversionary activities as patients recover Be accountable to patients Keep patients informed of care plans Ask them about care, and determine if they would like to change anything Review questions 1. The nurse is assessing pain in a patient with appendicitis. Which initial statement or question will be most effective in eliciting information? /H18540A. \"Tell me how you're feeling pain.\" pain medication relieve your pain?\" makes your pain worse, doesn't it?\" Correct answer: A Asking the patient to describe how he's feeling is an open-ended question, allowing for the widest range of responses. Asking the patient to point to his pain (Option B) may be an important follow-up question but is too limiting to be the nurse's rst question. Asking if pain medication relieves his pain (Option C) is a closed question requiring only a yes-or-no response and should be avoided. Option D is leading as well as closed. It suggests to the patient that coughing should make his pain worse. 2. When performing an abdominal assessment, the nurse should follow which examination sequence? /H18540A. Auscultation, auscultation, inspection Correct answer: B The correct sequence for abdominal assessment is inspection, auscultation, percus- sion, and palpation because this sequence prevents altering bowel sounds with palpation before ausculta-tion. The correct sequence for all other assessments is inspection, palpation, percussion, and auscultation. 3. To maintain a therapeutic environment with a patient and his family, the nurse can use communication techniques such as clari cation. An example aren't concerned, but you've asked me many questions on this same subject.\" /H18540C. \"What do you mean when you say...?\" /H18540D. \"For now, I would like to concentrate on...\" Correct answer: C Option C is an example of clari cation or seeking validation. Option A isn't an example of clari cation but is instead an example of a broad-opening technique. Option B is an example of confrontation, which calls attention to discrepancies in what the patient is saying. Option D is an example of focusing or helping the patient direct his thoughts.

In the stages of death and dying as de ned by Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross, loss, grief, and intense sadness are symptoms of: /H18540A. depression. /H18540B. denial. /H18540C. anger. /H18540D. acceptance. Correct answer: A Loss, grief, and intense sadness indicate depression. Denial (Option B) is indicated by the refusal to admit the truth or reality. Anger (Option C) is manifested by rage and resentment. Acceptance (Option D) is evidenced by a gradual, peaceful withdrawal from life. 5. In the levels of basic human needs as de ned by Abraham Maslow, which of the following levels is most basic? /H18540A. Physiologic /H18540B. Safety and security /H18540C. Love, affection, and belonging /H18540D. Esteem Correct answer: A Physiologic needs (Option A) are the most basic needs and essential for sustaining life. Once physiologic needs are met, needs for safety and security (Option B) can be met, followed by love, affection, and belonging (Option C), and esteem (Option D). 6. According to the stages of development, what confl ict does the older adult experience? /H18540A. Intimacy versus isolation /H18540B. Generativity versus stagnation /H18540C. Identity versus role confusion /H18540D. Integrity versus despair Correct answer: D The key confl ict the older adult (age 66 and older) faces is integrity versus despair. Intimacy versus isolation (Option A) is the key confl ict in young adulthood; generativity versus stagna- tion (Option B), the key confl ict in middle adulthood; and identity versus role confusion (Option C), the key confl ict of adolescence. 7. The nurse is caring for a patient who has just been diagnosed with a terminal illness. The patient says to her, \"I can't believe this! I feel...\" and pauses. The nurse allows the patient time to gather his thoughts. What type of therapeutic communication is answer: D The nurse allows the patient time to gather his thoughts by using silence. Clari ca- tion (Option A) would be seeking validation for what the patient said. Empathy (Option B) would be the nurse placing herself temporarily in the patient's position. Refl ection (Option C) would be paraphrasing what the patient said. Med-Surg_Chap04.indd 49 Med-Surg_Chap04.indd 49 8/2/2011 2:45:47 PM 8/2/2011 2:45:47 PM50 Principles of medical-surgical nursing 8. A patient becomes angry attending a treatment group and complains about it to the nurse. Which response could the nurse give that would best demonstrate clari cation? /H18540A. \"Can you tell me what about the treatment group made you angry?\" /H18540B. \"Why are you upset? Attending the treatment group will help you get well.\" /H18540C. \"It sounds like group today was pretty upsetting.\" /H18540D. \"Treatment groups have been carefully planned by the staff to help patients.\" Correct answer: A Option A uses clari cation to seek validation of what the patient said. Using \"why,\" as in Option B, is accusatory and can hinder self-disclosure. Option C is an example of empathy, and Option D is a destructive sentence that negates the patient's importance. 9. Which of Piaget's cognitive developmental stages takes place from ages 7 to 11? /H18540A. Formal operations /H18540B. Concrete operations /H18540C. Preoperational /H18540D. Sensorimotor Correct answer: B The concrete operations stage takes place between ages 7 and 11. The formal opera- tions stage (Option A) occurs at age 11 and above. The preoperational stage (Option C) takes place between ages 2 to 7, and the sensorimotor stage (Option D) occurs from birth to age 2 years. 10. Which interaction style describes a nurse who cannot clearly separate her own emotional responses from the patient's needs and wants? /H18540A. Holistic /H18540B. Defensive /H18540C. Sympathetic /H18540D. Silence Correct answer: C A sympathetic interaction style occurs when the nurse can't clearly separate her own emotional responses from the patient's needs and wants. Nurses who use a holistic interaction style (Option A) have healthy ego boundaries and provide an atmosphere that promotes patient growth. Nurses who tend to blame their patients and feel frustrated when they do not \"measure up\" have a defensive interaction style (Option B). Silence (Option D) is a type of therapeutic communication technique, not an interaction style. Med-Surg_Chap04.indd 50 Med-Surg_Chap04.indd 50 /H18546Skin, the body's largest organ and the outer covering of the body, serves as a protective barrier against microorganisms /H18546The skin is subject to injury from various external and internal factors External factors include extremes of heat and cold, mechanical forces such as pressure and shearing, allergens, chemicals, radiation, and excretions and secretions (for instance, from an ostomy or draining wound) Internal factors include emaciation, drugs, altered circulation and impaired oxygen transport, altered metabolic state, and infections De nitions /H18546Angiogenesis is the formation of new granulation vessels /H18546Cellulitis is the infl ammation of cellular or connective tissue /H18546Colonization refers to the presence of bacteria that cause no local or systemic indications of infection /H18546Dehiscence is the separation of the layers of a surgical wound /H18546Eschar is thick, leathery, necrotic, devitalized tissue /H18546Friction is the mechanical force exerted when skin rubs against a coarse surface such as bed linens /H18546Full thickness describes a wound that involves skin loss with extensive destruction, tissue necrosis, or damage to muscle, bone, or supporting structures /H18546Infection is the invasion and multiplication of microorganisms in body tissue in a suf cient quantity (greater than 1 million organisms per gram of tissue) to overwhelm tissue defenses; an infection can pro-duce purulent exudate, odor, erythema, warmth, tenderness, edema, pain, fever, and an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count /H18546Maceration is the softening of tissue by wetting or soaking; it can produce skin degeneration and disin- tegration if left uncontrolled /H18546Partial thickness describes a wound that involves damage to epidermal and, possibly, dermal skin layers /H18546Sloughing is the separation of necrotic tissue from viable tissue /H18546Shearing is trauma caused by tissue layers sliding against one another; it results in disruption or stran- gulation of blood vessels and can result in skin tear injuries /H18546A wound is any disruption to the anatomic or physiologic function of tissue Types of wounds /H18546An acute wound heals uneventfully within an expected time frame unless underlying systemic condi- tions interrupt the process; examples include surgical incisions and trauma wounds /H18546A wound is chronic when underlying pathophysiology causes the wound or interferes with the course of healing; several types exist (see Characteristics of acute and chronic wounds, page 52)Principles of wound carePrinciples of wound care 51 51 8/3/2011 PM of care Wound-healing process /H18546A dynamic process that restores anatomic and functional integrity, wound healing works on a con- tinuum from injury to healing In healing by primary intention, the wound is surgically closed (such as with sutures, staples, glue, or Steri-Strips), and healing occurs by brous adhesion; granulation tissue isn't apparent, and there's little or no scar tissue; examples include surgical wounds and super cial traumatic wounds In healing by secondary intention, the wound's edges are too far apart to be surgically closed, and there's marked tissue loss; the wound is instead closed naturally by the formation and adhesion of granulation tissue and epithelialization; examples include pressure ulcers, dehisced surgical wounds, and traumatic injuries In healing by tertiary intention, also known as delayed primary closure , there's a delay in wound closure, resulting in granulation of the wound edges; later surgical closure results in more scar formation; these wounds are sometimes left open for several days to allow edema or infection to resolve or exudate to drain /H18546Wound healing consists of several phases The injury is a break in the skin's integrity Hemostasis is a brief period of vasoconstriction at the site of injury as the body attempts to prevent excessive bleeding The infl ammatory phase starts right after the injury and lasts from 2 to 6 days; this defensive reaction to tissue injury involves increased blood fl ow and capillary permeability and aids in phagocytosis or auto- lytic debridement; it's marked by increased heat, redness, swelling, and pain in the affected area During the proliferative phase, granulation tissue forms and epithelialization begins Granulation tissue is a pink-to-red, moist tissue that contains new blood vessels, collagen, bro- blasts, and infl ammatory cells; the tissue lls the open deep wound and acts as a kind of scaffolding for the eventual migration of epithelial cells During epithelialization, epithelial cells migrate across the wound's surface, forming a layer of new tissue; these cells look silvery and form a perimeter around the granulation tissue As epithelial closure occurs, the wound contracts and begins to close During the nal maturation phase, collagen reorganizes and strengthens, a process that continues for months and sometimes years; chronic wounds may regain 50% of their original tensile strength after 2 to 3 weeks, but they'll ultimately regain only 70% to 75% of their original strength The following chart summarizes the type and cause, location, related signs and symptoms, and appearance of acute and chronic wounds. Speci c nursing measures vary with the type of wound.

may include undermining and tunneling Stage IV: full-thickness tissue loss with exposed bone, tendon, or muscle; slough or eschar may be present on some parts of wound bed; often includes undermining and tunneling Unstageable: full-thickness tissue loss in which the base of the ulcer is covered by slough (yellow, tan, gray, green, or brown) or eschar (tan, brown, or black) or both in the wound bedCharacteristics of acute and chronic wounds (continued) Factors that affect wound healing /H18546Local factors Moisture\u2014for instance, from incontinence\u2014leads to skin maceration and edema, making the epidermis more susceptible to abrasion; the chemicals and bacteria in urine and stool also cause tissue breakdown Necrotic debris and other foreign material in a wound interfere with optimal healing and must be removed; by increasing the bacterial count, dead tissue increases the risk of infection Infection at a level of more than 1 million organisms per gram of tissue inhibits granulation and epithelialization /H18546Systemic factors Aging has a profound impact on all body systems; it affects wound healing by decreasing the infl am- matory response, delaying angiogenesis, decreasing collagen synthesis and degradation, slowing epi-thelialization (resulting in a thinner epidermal layer), decreasing cohesion between the epidermal and dermal layers, decreasing the function of sebaceous glands (resulting in dryness), and altering the func-tion of melanocytes (resulting in skin discoloration) Malnutrition delays or prevents healing by depriving the body of the nutrients it needs to combat the physiologic stress of infection and to meet the increased metabolic demands of tissue repair; patients with chronic or dif cult-to-heal wounds have special dietary needs (see The role of nutrition in wound healing ) Dehydration can hasten debilitation and death; a patient with a large wound can lose far more than 1 L of water per day, the water loss of a healthy adult Med-Surg_Chap05.indd 54 Med-Surg_Chap05.indd 54 8/3/2011 7:28:38 PM healing 55 Vascular insuf ciency can lead to poor healing and the development of leg ulcers Arterial insuf ciency results in an inadequate blood supply, which can lead to tissue hypoxia, infection, and death Cardiovascular insuf ciency leads to systemic which impedes wound healing Venous insuf ciency\u2014impaired fl ow toward the heart and elevated pressure in the venous system\u2014leads to the leakage of brinogen around capillaries into the dermis; this results in forma- tion of a brin layer that blocks tissue oxygenation, nutrient exchange, and waste removal /H18546Metabolic factors A patient with diabetes mellitus requires strict maintenance of normal blood glucose levels for proper wound healing, particularly for the acute phase of tissue repair, during periods of stress, after surgery, and for combating sepsis; poorly controlled diabetes results in notoriously slow and compli-cated wound healing for several reasons Impaired circulation caused by thickening of the capillary basement membrane results in reduced local blood fl ow Reduced sensation from diabetic neuropathy signi cantly reduces sensation in the lower extremi- ties, making patients less aware of injuries and serious infectionsThe following chart outlines the role protein, calories, vitamins, and minerals play in wound healing.

decreased tensile strengthNecessary for collagen synthesis; not stored in body so de ciency occurs quickly Vitamin A 1,000 mcg Decreased epithelialization, collagen synthesis, resistance to infection by way of decreased macrophage productionSupplementation reverses effects of glucocorticoids Vitamin B62 mcg Decreased protein synthesisNeeded for protein metabolism Vitamin B122 mcg Decreased protein synthesisNeeded for cell proliferation and tissue synthesis Folate 200 mcg Decreased protein synthesisEnables transport of oxygen; decreased absorption in elderly patients so supplementation may be necessary Zinc 15 mg Decreased immunity, collagen synthesisEnables protein synthesis and tissue repair; healing improves after supplementation in true de ciencyThe role of nutrition in wound healing Med-Surg_Chap05.indd 55 Med-Surg_Chap05.indd 55 8/3/2011 7:28:38 impairs the infl ammatory response and collagen synthesis and produces leukocyte dysfunction, which increases the risk of infection Renal failure or insuf ciency increases the risk of infection and wound dehiscence and delays granulation A newly recognized disorder, reperfusion injury is thought to result from the uncontrolled release of free radicals (superoxide anion, hydroxyl radicals, and hydrogen peroxide) when ischemic tissue is reperfused or reoxygenated; oxygen-free radicals can cause damage to cell membranes, lipids, proteins, blood vessels, and deoxyribonucleic acid and can trigger the infl ammatory process /H18546Neurologic factors The absence of pain sensation can lead to signi cant tissue damage from pressure or trauma; a patient who doesn't feel pain can't respond to alleviate the pain Immobility and impaired sensory perception contribute to pressure ulcer development and delayed healing /H18546Psychological factors Stress, depression, and sleep disorders can alter the immune response A stressed, depressed, or sleep-deprived patient is less likely to participate in self-care, including wound care The sleep deprivation that can result from many psychological disorders interferes with the restor- ative properties of rest and sleep Some patients with severe psychiatric disorders may deliberately injure themselves or interfere with wound care measures /H18546Immunologic de ciencies Immunologic de ciencies impair many aspects of the infl ammatory phase of healing Such de ciencies also predispose patients to infection /H18546Clotting disorders Clotting disorders interfere with the coagulation cascade critical in wound healing Platelet aggregation normally initiates hemostasis and the release of chemotactic and growth- promoting substances, but clotting factor de ciencies (for instance, from hemophilia, malnutrition, or hepatic disease), thrombocytopenia, and anticoagulation therapy can prolong bleeding into a wound and delay healing /H18546Other factors Glucocorticoid therapy (for instance, with prednisone or hydrocortisone) can interfere with healing by suppressing the infl ammatory response, preventing macrophages from migrating into the wound, reducing broblast and endothelial cell activity, and delaying contraction and epithelialization Medications, including anti-infl ammatory drugs, cancer- ghting agents, anticoagulants, and anti- prostaglandins, interfere with the normal healing process Nursing assessment /H18546General assessment Determine the patient's age Ask about urinary and fecal incontinence Note any chronic illnesses that can interfere with wound healing, including diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and arteriosclerotic heart disease Assess the patient's nutritional status, including general appearance and skin turgor, and hydration status; look for signs of weight loss Make sure the patient's laboratory values fall within the normal range: serum albumin level, 3.5 to 5 g/dL; serum transferrin level, 200 to 400 mg/dL; total lymphocyte count, 1,800 to 3,000 mL; and thyroxine-binding level, 15.7 to 29.6 mg/dL Assess the patient's oxygenation and circulation status, noting indications of respiratory and circula- tory impairment and peripheral vascular disease; ask if he patient's immune status; ask about corticosteroid use, and ask if the patient has been diag- nosed with cancer and is undergoing chemotherapy; determine whether he tests positive for the human immunode ciency virus Ask about use of medications, including antiinfl ammatories, immunosuppres- sants, antineoplastics, anticoagulants, and antiprostaglandins Determine the patient's stress level, asking about family support and community resources /H18546Wound assessment Determine the wound's cause Note the wound's location Measure the wound's length, width, and depth in centimeters Determine the wound's stage Observe the wound margins, looking for undermining, tunneling, and sinus tracts Look for exudate in the wound, observing the amount and type (serous, serosanguineous, sanguine- ous, or purulent); note any odor Assess the tissue in the wound bed Granulation tissue will look beefy red Epithelial tissue will look pearly pink Sloughing necrotic or devitalized tissue will look soft and yellow-gray; eschar necrotic tissue will look thick and black Note signs of infection, including induration, fever, erythema, edema, an elevated WBC count, and purulent drainage Management /H18546Prevention of pressure ulcers Identify patients at risk, including bedridden and chair-bound patients and patients who have dif- culty repositioning themselves Using a valid risk assessment tool, assess at-risk patients for pressure ulcers on admission and at regular intervals;

this allows the enzymes natu- rally present in the wound fl uid to digest devitalized tissue Chemical or enzymatic debridement involves the topical application of a proteolytic substance (such as enzymes) to break down devitalized tissue Use pressurized irrigation (a 35-mL syringe with a #18 needle or angiocatheter) to clean the wound surface or cavity; use a noncytotoxic agent such as normal saline solution Absorb excess exudate with collagen or calcium alginates or absorbent powders, beads, or paste Pack dead space with collagen or calcium alginates or moistened saline nonwoven gauze dressings Use a moisture-retentive dressing that keeps the wound bed moist but leaves the surrounding skin dry Use one of the following dressings for a wound with light to moderate exudate A transparent lm is a clear, adherent, nonabsorptive, polymer-based dressing that is perme- able to oxygen and water vapor but not to water; it's used to treat partial-thickness wounds and wounds with eschar (to promote autolysis) A hydrogel is a nonadherent dressing composed of water and a polymer that has some absorptive properties; it's used to treat partial- to full-thickness wounds, dry wounds, wounds with minimal drainage, wounds with necrosis or slough, and infected wounds A foam dressing is made up of a spongelike polymer; it can be adherent and has some absorp- tive properties, and is used to treat partial- to full-thickness wounds and wounds with minimal to heavy drainage (including around tubes) Med-Surg_Chap05.indd 59 Med-Surg_Chap05.indd 59 8/3/2011 7:28:39 PM 8/3/2011 7:28:39 PM60 of wound care A hydrocolloid is an adhesive, moldable wafer made of a carbohydrate-based material, usually with a backing that's impermeable to oxygen, water, and water vapor; the thin version has some absorptive properties; it's used to treat partial- to full-thickness wounds, wounds with minimal to moderate drainage, and wounds with necrosis or slough For a wound with moderate to heavy exudate, use a foam dressing, a collagen or calcium alginate dressing (a nonwoven, absorptive dressing made from seaweed), or a hydrocolloid dressing, which is more absorbent than the thin dressing Take steps to improve the patient's overall condition Provide nutritional support Arrange for a nutritional consultation Provide nutritional supplements as needed Make sure the patient is hydrated Maintain the patient's oxygenation and circulation If the patient experiences venous insuf ciency, use compression to optimize venous return If the patient is diabetic, take steps to control his blood glucose level Institute measures to optimize the patient's arterial blood supply and avoid circulatory impairment Help the patient reduce his stress level by involving him and his family in his care; contact the appropriate community resources Minimize the patient's pain Provide suf cient analgesia before, during, and after dressing changes Choose dressings that maximize the time between dressing changes and that cause minimal tissue trauma Teach the patient relaxation techniques and guided imagery to help control pain and maximize the effects of pain medication Review questions 1. A patient with an arterial ulcer over the left lateral malleolus complains of pain at the ulcer site. The nurse caring for this patient understands that the pain is caused most commonly by which of the following? an arterial ulcer site typically results from ischemia caused by reduced arterial blood fl ow. Option A is incorrect because infection is a complication of arterial ulceration that may not occur in all patients with arterial ulceration. Option B is incorrect because arterial ulcers have minimal exudate. Option D is incorrect because edema isn't present with arterial ulcers. 2. A patient, age 54, is admitted with a diagnosis of venous ulceration unresponsive to treatment. Which of the following is the nurse most likely to nd during an assessment of a patient with venous ulceration? Gangrene /H18540B. Heavy exudate /H18540D. Pale wound bed Correct answer: B Moderate to heavy exudate is one characteristic of a venous ulcer. Other characteris- tics include irregular wound margins, super cial wound bed, and ruddy, granular tissue. Options A, C, and D are incorrect because they're characteristics of arterial ulcers. PM 8/3/2011 7:28:39 PMReview questions 61 3. The nurse is providing care for a patient who has a sacral pressure ulcer with a wet-to-dry dressing. Which guideline is appropriate when caring for a patient with a wet-to-dry dressing? /H18540A. The wound should remain moist from the dressing. /H18540B. The wet-to-dry dressing should be tightly packed into the wound. /H18540C. The dressing should be allowed to dry before it's removed. /H18540D. A plastic sheet-type dressing should cover the wet dressing. Correct answer: C A wet-to-dry dressing should be allowed to dry and adhere to the wound before being removed. The goal is to debride the wound as the dressing is removed. Option A is incorrect because the wet-to-dry dressing isn't applied to keep a wound moist; a moist saline dressing is applied to keep a wound moist. Option B is incorrect because tightly packing a wound damages the tissues. Option D is incorrect because a wet-to-dry dressing should be covered with a dry gauze dressing, not a plastic sheet-type dressing. 4. The nurse is assessing the laboratory values of a patient with an abdominal wound healing by secondary intention. Which of the following laboratory values indicates that the patient is receiving adequate nutrition? /H18540A. Serum albumin level 190 mg/dL /H18540D. Total lymphocyte count of 1,900 mL Correct answer: D A total lymphocyte count greater than 1,800 mL indicates adequate nutrition. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because these laboratory values indicate poor nutrition. 5. What term describes the softening of tissue by softening of tissue by wetting or soaking. Eschar (Option A) is thick, leathery, necrotic, devitalized tissue. Sloughing (Option C) is the separation of necrotic tissue from viable tissue. Angiogenesis (Option D) is the formation of new granulation vessels. 6. After assessing a patient's pressure ulcer, you note that subcutaneous fat is visible but that bone, tendon, and muscle are not exposed. You observe slough, but it does not obscure the depth of tissue loss. You also note some undermining and tunneling. What stage pressure ulcer is this? /H18540A. Stage II /H18540B. Suspected deep tissue injury /H18540C. Stage III /H18540D. Stage IV Correct answer: C A Stage III pressure ulcer involves full-thickness tissue loss, possibly with visible sub- cutaneous fat but with no exposer of bone, tendon, or muscle; slough may be present but doesn't obscure the depth of tissue loss, and undermining and tunneling may also be present. A Stage II pressure ulcer (Option A) involves a partial-thickness tissue loss presenting as a shallow, open ulcer with a red-pink wound bed without slough. A suspected deep tissue injury (Option B) involves a purple or maroon local-ized area of discolored intact skin or blood- lled blister resulting from damage of underlying soft tissue from pressure, shear, or both. A stage IV pressure ulcer (Option D) involves full-thickness tissue loss with exposed bone, tendon, or muscle; slough or eschar may be present on some parts of the wound bed.

During which stage of healing does granulation tissue form and epithelialization occur? /H18540A. The maturation phase /H18540B. The epithelial /H18540C. The infl ammatory phase /H18540D. The proliferative phase Correct answer: D During the proliferative stage of wound healing, granulation tissue forms and epi- thelialization occurs. In the nal maturation phase (Option A), collagen reorganizes and strengthens. In the epithelial closure phase (Option B), the wound contracts and begins to close. The infl ammatory phase (Option C) starts right after injury and doesn't involve granulation tissue formation or epithelialization. 8. Which of the following are external factors that subject the skin to injury? /H18540A. Emaciation and infections /H18540D. Allergens and infections Correct answer: B Allergens and radiation are external factors that subject the skin to injury. Emacia- tion (included in Options A and C) and infection (included in Options A and D) are internal factors. 9. Where is a venous ulcer typically found on a patient? /H18540A. The medial lower leg and ankle /H18540B. The plantar aspect of foot /H18540C. On a bony prominence /H18540D. Under the heels Correct answer: A A venous ulcer is typically found on the medial lower leg and ankle. A diabetic ulcer is usually found on the plantar aspect of the foot (Option B) or under the heels (Option D). A pressure ulcer is usually found on a bony prominence (Option C). 10. Which substance enables the transport of oxygen during wound healing? /H18540A. Zinc /H18540B. Vitamin Correct answer: C Folate enables the transport of oxygen during wound healing. Zinc (Option A) enables protein synthesis and tissue repair. Vitamin B6 (Option B) decreases collagen and protein synthe- sis, and vitamin C (Option D) is needed for collagen synthesis. Med-Surg_Chap05.indd 62 Med-Surg_Chap05.indd 62 8/3/2011 Stress /H18546General information Stress is the body's response to stressors or stimuli that are perceived as threatening Stressors can be biophysical (such as disease, trauma, and overexertion), chemical (such as pollution, drugs, and alcohol), psychosocial (such as job loss, divorce, and bankruptcy), or cultural (such as travel- ing, being separated from family members during hospitalization, and delegating decision making to health care providers) The body responds to stress physiologically and psychologically /H18546Selye's stress theory Hans Selye's theory describes a general adaptation syndrome that consists of three stages of a hor- monally controlled stress response The rst stage is the alarm reaction, in which the person is alerted to the presence of a stressor and the need to act The second stage is resistance In this stage, the pituitary gland secretes corticotropin Corticotropin stimulates the production which pro- mote and inhibit infl ammation, allowing the body to protect or surrender tissue If resistance continues and the body doesn't adapt, the third stage is exhaustion, which can lead to disease or death According to Selye, stress can result from positive or negative events /H18546Physiologic stress responses Physiologic responses to stress involve the central nervous system, hypothalamus, sympathetic ner- vous system, are secreted or stimulated by these organs in response to a stressor Their release results in the body's ght-or-fl ight response to stress The initial reaction to stress is increased alertness in preparation for ght or fl ight Blood vessels dilate, heart rate increases, the rate and depth of respirations increase, and broncho- dilation occurs; these reactions increase the oxygen supply to organs and muscles The arterioles in the skin, kidneys, and abdominal viscera constrict; blood is shunted from the GI tract and periphery to the brain, heart, and major muscles Gluconeogenesis increases; decreased insulin secretion and increased fatty acid metabolism increase the amount of glucose available for energy Localized sweat production increases, and muscles become tense Pain tolerance increases as endorphins (endogenous opiates) are released Repeated physiologic stress responses can damage the body, resulting in problems such as kidney failure, gastric ulcers, and exacerbation of an existing disorder The body's level of physiologic response to stress varies according to the stimuli; most physiologic stress responses aren't helpful in coping with the daily stresses of life /H18546Psychological stress responses Psychological stress responses result when the body's ability to adapt to change is exceeded; a person adapts to psychological stress through coping strategies, such as problem solving, reappraising stress-ors, and rehearsing responses to stressDisruptions in homeostasis The body's psychological response to stress varies according to the stressor's intensity and duration and the perceived control over the stressor Psychological stress can cause physical manifestations, such as hypertension and digestive disor- ders, and psychological manifestations, such as anxiety attacks and eating disorders When psychological stress exceeds a person's coping abilities, crisis (extreme psychological dis- equilibrium) may occur /H18546Nursing assessment of stress The nurse should identify the source and duration of the stress, the patient's resources and coping strategies, and the effects of the stress on the patient and family members Sources of stress include illness and hospitalization Stressors related to illness include pain, fear of loss of a body part or function, fear of prognosis, and fear of dis gurement Stressors related to hospitalization or treatment include perceived loss of control, increased depen- dence, change in environment, loss of roles as worker and provider for family, change in routine, and lack of trust in the caregivers The duration of the stress depends on the stressor, which can be acute or chronic, intermittent or continuous External resources include family members and signi cant others; internal resources include past experiences with illness or hospitalization, education, and spirituality Coping strategies consist of past methods that have been effective for the patient, such as information seeking, relaxation techniques, prayer, counseling, physical or mental activity, meditation, discussion of options, and review of events or event rehearsal Repeated stress responses can have physical effects Immediate responses include rapid speech, restlessness, rapid heart rate, light-headedness, and palpitations Long-term responses include headaches, neck and stomach aches, muscle cramps, and changes in eating, elimination, and sleep patterns Repeated stress responses can cause psychosocial symptoms, including changes in family or working relationships, denial or anger, hopelessness, silence, or the inability to make decisions The nurse can use life-event questionnaires to measure stressors in a patient's life and hardiness scales to determine a patient's ability to cope with or adapt to stress /H18546Nursing interventions Physical interventions reduce tension and support organ function Massage, heat application, warm baths, stretching exercises, and physical activity can reduce muscle tension, serve as distractions, and increase the ability to put stressors in perspective Activities to protect organ function include monitoring for complications such as ileus and GI bleeding, checking urine output, and assessing glucose levels Educational interventions include teaching the patient or family about stress and the body's response to it and rehearsing events to prepare the patient for stress-producing events Teaching plans should include what to expect from the stress-producing situation Event rehearsal helps the patient to review an expected sequence of events and deal with anxiety- producing situations in a controlled environment before the actual event occurs Emotional support can be given through counseling, encouraging discussions, sharing feelings, ver- balizing dif culties, and supporting family problem solving; helping patients to separate themselves from the issue can help maintain their self-esteem Social support activities include evaluating nancial status, assisting with insurance forms, providing referrals for home health care assistance, and evaluating spirituality needs (with appropriate referrals to clergy) Shock /H18546General information Shock is an acute state of reduced perfusion of all body tissues Med-Surg_Chap06.indd 64 Med-Surg_Chap06.indd 64 8/17/2011 3:43:15 PM 8/17/2011 3:43:15 PMShock 65 Inadequate circulating blood volume results in decreased delivery of oxygen to tissues and decreased gas exchange in the capillaries Inadequate oxygenation leads to impaired cellular metabolism and an inability to excrete metabolic waste products /H18546Pathogenesis of shock Initial stage Decrease in cardiac output leads to decrease in mean arterial pressure Sympathetic nervous system is stimulated, leading to initiation of stress response Signs and symptoms include normal to slightly increased heart rate, normal to slightly decreased blood pressure, thirst, and pale, cool, moist skin over the face Compensatory stage Decrease in mean arterial pressure stimulates the sympathetic nervous system to release epineph- rine and norepinephrine to try to achieve homeostasis Stimulation of alpha1-adrenergic bers causes vasoconstriction of vessels in the skin, GI organs, kidneys, muscles, and lungs, shunting blood to the heart and brain Stimulation of beta-adrenergic bers causes vasodilation of coronary and cerebral arteries, increases heart rate, and increases force of myocardial contractions, resulting in increased cardiac output Reduced renal blood fl ow leads to release of renin and production of angiotensin, resulting in vasoconstriction and stimulation of the adrenal cortex to release aldosterone, increasing renal sodium reabsorption Increased serum osmolarity stimulates the release of antidiuretic hormone, resulting in increased water reabsorption by the kidneys and increased venous blood return to the heart and, ultimately, increased cardiac output Signs and symptoms include restlessness, normal or decreasing blood pressure, bounding or thready pulse, tachycardia, tachypnea, normal or hypoactive bowel sounds, slightly decreased urine output, and pale, cool skin (fl ushed and warm in septic shock) Progressive stage Compensatory mechanisms become ineffective and possibly even counterproductive Falling cardiac output and vasoconstriction cause cellular hypoxia and anaerobic metabolism; metabolic ischemia stimulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, causing further vasoconstriction Fluid shifts from intravascular to interstitial space Signs and symptoms include falling blood pressure; narrowed pulse pressure; cold, clammy skin; rapid, shallow respirations; anuria; and subnormal body temperature (subnormal or elevated in septic shock) Irreversible stage Compensatory mechanisms are ineffective Lactic acid continues to accumulate, and capillary permeability dilation increases, resulting in loss of intravascular volume and tachycardia; this further aggravates falling blood pressure and cardiac output Coronary and cerebral perfusion decline, and organ systems fail Signs and symptoms include unresponsiveness; arefl exia; severe hypotension; slow, irregular slow, shallow, irregular respirations; Cheyne-Stokes respirations; and respiratory and cardiac arrest /H18546Types of shock (see Comparing types of shock, page 66) Cardiogenic shock results from an inadequate pumping function that causes decreased cardiac output and stroke volume, leading to inadequate tissue perfusion and a precipitous drop in blood pressure and urine output; it results from such occurrences as acute myocardial acute in homeostasis Some assessment ndings and treatments are common to all types of shock. Others are speci c to the type of shock. Assessment ndings Treatment All types of shock Acid-base imbalance, such as metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis Anuria or oliguria Anxiety and restlessness Changes in respiratory rate such as tachypnea Confusion, lethargy, and coma Cool, clammy skin Decreased pulse pressure and tachycardia Decreased urine creatinine clearance and elevated urine speci c gravity Elevated blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, potassium, and lactate levels Elevated hematocrit (with volume depletion) Extreme thirst Hypotension Hypothermia (except in septic shock) Increase perfusion to vital organs. Increase peripheral perfusion. Decrease myocardial oxygen demand and workload. Relieve pulmonary congestion. Correct acid-base imbalances. Ensure adequate oxygenation. Cardiogenic shock Ashen or cyanotic skin Decreased level of consciousness Decreased sensorium Gallop rhythm, faint heart sounds and, possibly, a holosystolic murmur Jugular vein distention Mean arterial pressure less than 60 mm Hg in adults Pale, cold, clammy skin Pulmonary crackles Rapid, irregular, thready pulse Rapid, shallow respirations Severe anxiety Urine output less than 20 mL/hour Administer an inotropic medication, such as dobutamine, dopamine, milrinone, or inamrinone. Administer a vasopressor, such as dopamine, norepinephrine, or phenylephrine. Administer a vasodilator, such as nitroglycerin or nitroprusside. Administer morphine to reduce preload and afterload. Maintain normal pH and partial pressure of oxygen in blood. Intubate the patient and administer oxygen as needed. If the patient has no signs of pulmonary edema, infuse fl uid; if the patient has signs of pulmonary edema, administer a diuretic such as furosemide. Ensure adequate relief of pain and anxiety. Correct electrolyte imbalances. Control arrhythmias. Use intra-aortic balloon pump therapy to reduce left ventricle's workload. Place patient on ventricular-assist device if needed. Hypovolemic shock Decreased sensorium Mean arterial pressure less than 60 mm Hg in adults (in chronic hypotension, mean pressure may fall below 50 mm Hg before signs of shock) Pale, cool, clammy skin Rapid, irregular, thready pulse Rapid, shallow respirations Urine output usually less than 20 mL/hour Increase intravascular volume with the appropriate solution, such as blood or a blood product, a colloid preparation, a plasma expander, or a crystalloid solution. Administer a vasopressor, such as norepinephrine, epinephrine, or dopamine. Administer an inotropic medication, such as dobutamine, dopamine, milrinone, or inamrinone. Maintain a patent airway, and supply oxygen as needed.

Administer a vasopressor, such as norepinephrine or dopamine. Administer a steroid. Administer a bronchodilator if needed. Distributive shock: neurogenic shock Bradycardia a vasopressor, such as dopamine and epinephrine. Use a plasma expander to ensure adequate volume. If bradycardia develops, administer atropine. Hypovolemic shock results from decreased intravascular volume in relation to the vascular bed's size; loss of blood plasma into the tissues leads to decreased circulating blood volume and venous return, reduced cardiac output, and inadequate tissue perfusion This type of shock is classi ed by the amount of blood loss: class I is an acute loss of up to 15% of blood volume; class II, 16% to 30%; class III, 31% to 40%; and class IV, more than 40% Absolute, or measurable, external fl uid losses can be caused by hemorrhage, burns, trauma, sur- gery, dehydration, intestinal immeasurable, internal fl uid losses in the intravascular space can be caused by venous or arterial pooling and in the extravascular space, by capillary leakage Distributive shock results from poor distribution of blood to the tissues, which is caused by acute vaso- dilation without simultaneous expansion of the intravascular volume; anaphylactic, neurogenic, and septic shock are types of distributive shock Anaphylactic shock results from an antigen-antibody reaction that releases histamine into the blood- stream, which causes widespread dilation of arterioles and capillary beds and bronchial hypersensi-tivity; it can be caused by allergic reactions to contrast media used in diagnostic tests, drugs, foods, animal and insect bites, and blood Med-Surg_Chap06.indd 67 Med-Surg_Chap06.indd results from decreased vasomotor tone with generalized vasodilation; it can result from general or spinal anesthesia, epidural block, spinal cord injury, vasovagal syncope, barbiturate or phenothiazine ingestion, and insulin shock Septic shock results from a systemic response to microorganisms in the blood, causing vasodilation with selective vasoconstriction and poor distribution of blood; it commonly stems from overt infec-tion, localized infection that spreads to the systemic circulation, urinary tract infection, postabortion or postpartal infection, or immunosuppressant therapy Obstructive shock results from a physical obstruction that reduces cardiac output despite normal con- tractility and intravascular volume; it's caused /H18546Complications of shock Myocardial depression may be caused by decreased coronary blood fl ow and acidosis and can lead to arrhythmias, MI, and cardiac failure Acute respiratory distress syndrome, also known as shock lung, may result from decreased perfusion to pulmonary capillaries Renal failure may occur when prolonged renal hypoperfusion causes acute tubular necrosis Hepatic insuf ciency may stem from poor perfusion to the liver and can lead to recirculation of bac- teria and cellular debris Disseminated intravascular coagulation may occur because shock causes excessive consumption of clotting factors GI ulcerations may occur when reduced blood fl ow increases acid production /H18546Nursing interventions Ensure an adequate airway Encourage coughing and deep breathing; administer medications for pain as needed to ensure deep breathing; suction as needed; and position the patient to maintain a patent airway and maximum ventilation Turn the patient frequently, and elevate the head of the bed, unless contraindicated Administer oxygen as prescribed Perform postural drainage and chest physiotherapy to mobilize secretions Evaluate breath sounds for crackles and wheezes Maintain hemodynamic stability Assess pulse rate and rhythm Assess blood pressure for changes, using a Doppler ultrasound transducer if a sphygmomanom- eter doesn't provide an audible blood pressure Maintain a normal temperature Prevent hypothermia (core temperature less than 95\u00b0 F [35\u00b0 C]) by setting the room thermostat higher, warming the room with infrared lights, covering the patient with warmed blankets, using a warming mat as prescribed, warming lavage solutions, and using a fl uid warmer when infusing I.V. solutions or blood Prevent hyperthermia (increase in body temperature and metabolic rate) by removing excess blan- kets, administering medications as prescribed to decrease temperature, giving a tepid sponge bath, and using a cooling mat as prescribed Maintain normal volume status to prevent fl uid imbalance Assess skin turgor for signs and symptoms of dehydration Note signs of extreme thirst Monitor urine output (amount, color, and speci c gravity) Monitor drainage (wound, gastric, and chest tube drainage) Check for abnormal breath sounds Assess the patient for weight gain or loss Infuse fl uids as prescribed Assess blood loss, if possible Prevent complications of shock Assess nutritional status to ensure adequate caloric intake to meet metabolic demands Watch for signs of decreased tissue perfusion, such as changes in skin color and temperature, level of consciousness (LOC), peripheral pulses, and urine output Prepare for transfer to the critical care unit if the patient's status deteriorates Med-Surg_Chap06.indd 3:43:16 PMInfl ammation and infection 69 Reduce patient and family anxiety Explain all procedures in understandable terms Medicate the patient for pain to ensure patient comfort Teach the patient relaxation techniques used to reduce anxiety Give family members time to ask questions and express concerns Follow infection control policies Infl ammation and infection /H18546Infl ammation The infl ammatory process is a defense mechanism that's activated in response to localized injury or infection; also called the local adaptation syndrome, this process acts to limit the spread of infection and promote wound healing The infl ammatory process occurs in three phases In the rst phase, blood vessels at the injury site constrict to control bleeding; vasoconstriction is followed by the release of histamines and increased capillary permeability to encourage blood fl ow and attract white blood cells (WBCs) to the area In the second phase, exudate is produced, the amount of which depends on the wound's size, loca- tion, and severity; exudate is composed of cells and fl uid that have escaped from blood vessels and may be serous, sanguineous, purulent, or a combination of the three In the nal stage, damaged cells are repaired by regeneration or formation of scar tissue /H18546Infection The infectious process results from a combination of several factors A causative agent (pathogen) must be present A reservoir must be available for the pathogen The reservoir must have a means of exit, such as the nares, feces, or wound drainage The pathogen must be transmitted directly or indirectly to the new host; direct transmission requires contact between the reservoir and the new host, whereas indirect transmission usually occurs when an inanimate object carries the pathogen The pathogen must enter the host through a portal of entry, such as the GI tract, respiratory tract, or a wound The pathogen's virulence and the host's susceptibility also affect the infection process Signs and symptoms of systemic and localized infections Systemic infections are generalized and produce symptoms in multiple body systems Prodromal symptoms, which may be vague, include malaise, weakness, fatigue, aches, and anorexia Progression of infection is evidenced by symptoms such as fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis with a shift in differential, and lymphadenopathy Severe untreated systemic infections can produce altered mental status, seizures, and shock Localized infections are limited to a speci c body region and produce symptoms in only one or two body systems Presenting signs and symptoms include pain, warmth, swelling, erythema, and itching at the affected site Progression of infection is evidenced by increasing redness and induration and the development of exudate Diagnostic ndings for both types of infection include elevated WBC counts and positive aerobic or anaerobic cultures Medical treatments for infections include antibiotic therapy, surgery to remove an infected body part, dead tissue debridement, and abscess drainage; these procedures remove the infection or reduce the number of organisms to be eliminated Nursing interventions for a patient with an infection consist primarily of monitoring and teaching Monitor the progression of infection Take the patient's vital signs Measure the extent of induration or visible Assess the patient's LOC Administer oral, parenteral, or topical antibiotics Apply heat to localized infections Apply sterile dressings to draining or open wounds Monitor drainage for amount, color, and odor Maintain standard precautions Document infection progression, treatments performed, and patient response Encourage adequate nutrition for wound healing Teach the patient to prevent future infections Instruct the patient to protect intact skin and mucous membranes by using precautions to prevent breakdown Stress the importance of hand washing Encourage nutritional maintenance of immune system responses Discuss avoidance of pathogens transmitted by way of the respiratory or GI tract Promote good hygiene Teach about wound care and antibiotic therapy Fluid imbalances /H18546General information Water accounts for 60% of the total body weight in adults and 80% in infants; the leaner the person, the greater the proportion of water to total body weight The intracellular fl uid (ICF) compartment includes water in the cells; this compartment accounts for 70% of total body water, or about 25 L of fl uid in an adult The extracellular fl uid (ECF) compartment includes water outside the cells; this compartment accounts for 30% of total body water, or about 15 L of fl uid (including 5 L of blood) Additional fl uids are contained in other body compartments Interstitial fl uid is found in the spaces between cells Plasma, an intravascular fl uid, is found within arteries, veins, and capillaries Cerebrospinal fl uid and intraocular fl uid are found in the spinal cord and eyes, respectively Alterations in the amount or composition of body fl uids can cause complications; a 10% fl uid loss (4 L) is serious, and a 20% loss (8 L) is fatal Body fl uids transport nutrients to and remove wastes from cells /H18546Fluid movement Body compartments are separated by semipermeable membranes that control fl uid movement through ltration, hydrostatic pressure, and osmosis Filtration is the passage of water and solutes across a semipermeable membrane Hydrostatic pressur e is pressure caused by a fl uid column in an enclosed area such as a blood vessel wall Osmosis is the passage of water through a semipermeable membrane from an area of low solute concentration to an area of high solute concentration A solution's osmolality, which is determined by the number of dissolved particles in the fl uid, also infl uences fl uid movement In an isotonic solution, the dissolved particle concentration equals that of ICF, causing no net water movement In a hypertonic solution, the dissolved particle concentration exceeds that of ICF, causing water to move out of the cell to the area of greater concentration; this movement causes cell shriveling In a hypotonic solution, the dissolved particle concentration is less than that of ICF, causing water to move into the cell; this movement causes cell swelling /H18546Organs that regulate fl uid movement The kidneys lter 180 L of plasma daily and excrete 1.5 L of urine daily (1 mL/kg/hour) They regulate ECF volume, osmolality, and electrolyte levels by selective retention and excretion of fl uids and electrolytes They regulate the pH of ECF by infl uencing hydrogen ion excretion or retention and the excretion of metabolic wastes and toxic substances 8/17/2011 3:43:16 PM 8/17/2011 3:43:16 PMFluid imbalances 71 The heart and blood vessels affect fl uid movement because adequate cardiac output is needed to maintain the renal perfusion pressure required for kidney function; decreased cardiac output decreases renal perfusion pressure Decreased renal perfusion pressure stimulates the stretch receptors in the atria and blood vessels to increase perfusion It also stimulates the release of aldosterone, which increases fl uid retention The lungs expel water vapor at the rate of 300 to 400 mL/day Increased respiratory rate or depth increases vapor loss Vapor loss is considered insensible water loss because the actual loss can't be observed or measured Skin affects fl uid movement by means of sweat (visible fl uid loss) and evaporation The rate of fl uid loss by means of sweat, which ranges from 0 to 1,000 mL/hour, is affected by body temperature; temperatures exceeding 101\u00b0 F (38.3\u00b0 C) increase the rate of loss, whereas tem-peratures below 101\u00b0 F decrease the rate of loss Sweat is considered a sensible water loss because the actual loss can be observed and measured Evaporation of fl uid from the skin also accounts for a water loss of 600 mL/day; it occurs as insen- sible perspiration The GI tract normally loses 100 to 200 mL of fl uid daily; diarrhea and stulas greatly increase this fl loss /H18546Hormonal infl uence Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), or vasopressin, is a hormone synthesized in the hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary; it affects fl uid balance by increasing water reabsorption in the renal tubules Increased osmolality and water de ciency stimulate ADH release Decreased osmolality and excess water intake inhibit ADH release Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid secreted by the adrenal cortex Increased aldosterone levels increase sodium retention, thereby increasing water retention Decreased sodium levels stimulate aldosterone secretion Increased sodium levels inhibit aldosterone secretion /H18546Thirst The thirst center is located in the anterior hypothalamus; intracellular dehydration stimulates hypo- thalamus cells, causing a sensation of thirst Thirst leads to increased water intake, which restores ECF volume /H18546Fluid volume de cit Description Fluid volume de cit (FVD) results from loss of body fl uids; isosmolar FVD occurs when equal pro- portions of water and sodium are lost; hyperosmolar FVD occurs when more water than sodium is lost, resulting in hypovolemia and hypernatremia Isosmolar FVD can result from traumatic injury; rapid blood loss; and decreased fl uid intake from nausea, anorexia, fatigue, depression, confusion, neurologic de cits that alter the ability to swallow or detect thirst, and oral or pharyngeal pain Hyperosmolar FVD can result from loss of GI fl uids through vomiting, diarrhea, GI suctioning, stulas, drains, third-space fl uid loss, and excessive use of tap water enemas; it also can result from polyuria or excessive urine formation, which is associated with diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome, nephritis, and diuretic use Fever can increase fl uid loss through diaphoresis and increased respiratory rate; a temperature more than 101\u00b0 F (38.3\u00b0 C) requires an extra 500 mL of fl uid daily, and more than 103\u00b0 F (39.4\u00b0 C) requires an extra 1,000 mL of fl uid daily Sweating can contribute to FVD Signs and symptoms Weight loss may be rapid (1 L of fl uid equals 2 lb) Skin turgor and elasticity may be decreased The oral cavity may be dry and have a smaller than normal tongue lined with visible longitudinal furrows Med-Surg_Chap06.indd 71 Med-Surg_Chap06.indd 71 8/17/2011 3:43:16 PM 8/17/2011 3:43:16 PM72 Disruptions in homeostasis Urine output may be decreased (less than 30 mL/hour for an adult), but speci c gravity may be increased Altered vital signs may include a subnormal body temperature, orthostatic hypotension, and increased heart rate Signs of decreased volume may include decreased central venous pressure (CVP), fl attened jugular veins, and slow- lling hand veins Altered sensorium and cold extremities also may occur Laboratory data may include elevated hematocrit, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level in relation to creatinine level, and serum sodium level greater than 150 mEq/L Medical management Replace fl uid loss orally, if possible, or by I.V. infusion (see Understanding parenteral solutions ) Correct the de cit's cause Nursing interventions Encourage fl uid intake, as appropriate, by providing adequate pain control, relieving nausea, offering fl uids, performing frequent skin and mouth care, and consulting the practitioner if the patient can't ingest fl uids orally Maintain accurate input and output records to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions Administer parenteral therapy as prescribed, and assess for complications Teach the patient and family about preventing, recognizing, and treating FVD /H18546Fluid volume excess Description Fluid volume excess (FVE) is the abnormal retention of water When accompanied by altered sodium levels, the condition is referred to as hyperosmolar FVE When water and sodium are retained in equal proportions, the condition is referred to as isosmo- lar FVE FVE results from compromised regulatory mechanisms, such as those seen in heart failure, renal failure, cirrhosis, and steroid excess It also can result from excessive administration of parenteral fl uids (especially those with a high sodium content) and excessive ingestion of sodium chloride or sodium salts Signs and symptoms Rapid weight gain that may be accompanied by peripheral edemaUnderstanding parenteral solutions Type of parenteral solution Examples Indications solution 10% water To treat severe hyponatremia To correct severe hyponatremia To treat hypoglycemia Hypotonic solution Half-normal saline solution To expand the intracellular compartment;

weight gain may refl ect volume gain Check for signs of pitting edema in the extremities, and assess the patient for neck vein distention Monitor arterial blood gas (ABG) studies for respiratory alkalosis Monitor breath sounds for changes such as crackles, and administer a diuretic as ordered Encourage rest periods to relieve shortness of breath and fatigue Protect the patient's skin from breakdown caused by the pressure of pitting edema Encourage use of the semi-Fowler position to increase lung capacity Educate the patient and family about preventing, recognizing, and treating FVE /H18546Third-space fl uid shift Description Third-space fl uid shift occurs when body fl uids move into the interstitial space from which these fl uids aren't exchanged readily with ECF It can result from acute intestinal obstruction, ascites, acute peritonitis, pancreatitis, acute gastric lym- phatic system blockage, and declamping phenomenon (which occurs when a clamp on the aorta is released during surgery) Phases of third-space fl uid shift In the fl uid accumulation phase, fl uid shifts from the intravascular space to the interstitial space The clinical presentation is similar to that of FVD; fl uid is lost from the intravascular space, thus decreasing perfusion Fluid losses can't be observed or measured In the fl uid shifting phase, interstitial fl uid shifts back to the intravascular space; the clinical presentation is similar to that of FVE when fl uid enters the intravascular space and enters the circulation Medical management Correct the fl uid shift's cause Treat the patient for symptoms of FVD or FVE as appropriate Nursing interventions For a patient with signs of FVD, see \"Fluid volume de cit: Nursing interventions,\" page 72 For a patient with signs of FVE, see \"Fluid volume excess: Nursing interventions,\" page 73 Electrolyte imbalances /H18546General information Electrolytes are substances that dissociate in solution and conduct a weak electrical current Intracellular electrolytes include potassium, magnesium, and Potassium is the principal it controls cellular osmotic pressure, infl uences skel- etal and cardiac muscle activity, and is dramatically affected by acid-base imbalance Magnesium, which also is an intracellular cation, is contained mostly in bone; it activates intracellular enzymes, contributes to carbohydrate and protein metabolism, and acts to dilate vessels, decrease blood pressure; imbalances can trigger ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac arrest Phosphate is the principal intracellular anion; it's essential for muscle, red blood cell (RBC), and ner- vous system functioning, and it plays a role in carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism Extracellular electrolytes include sodium, calcium, bicarbonate, and chloride Sodium is the principal extracellular cation; it's responsible for the osmotic pressure of ECF, and it doesn't readily cross the cell membrane Calcium, an extracellular cation, is concentrated in the skeletal system; it acts as cell cement, has a sedative effect on nerve cells, regulates muscle contraction and relaxation (including heartbeat), acti-vates enzymes that stimulate chemical reactions, and plays a role in blood coagulation Bicarbonate, an extracellular anion, plays a role in acid-base balance; it serves as a buffer to keep serum pH within normal limits and is regulated primarily by the kidneys Chloride is the principal extracellular anion; it helps maintain acid-base balance and works with sodium to help maintain osmotic pressure When the body can't maintain the normal level of an electrolyte, an imbalance can result (see Understanding electrolyte imbalances, pages 75 to 78) /H18546Electrolyte movement Electrolytes move in and out of cells through diffusion, osmosis, active transport, ltration, and plasma colloid osmotic pressure Diffusion is the movement of particles from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower con- centration across a semipermeable membrane The number of particles diffused depends on permeability, or the relative size of cell membrane pores in relation to the particle's size The greater the difference in particle concentration, the greater the diffusion rate Cell membrane pores are lined with positively charged ions that repel other positive ions and attract negative ions The difference in electric potential helps diffusion occur even without a concentration difference The pressure increase intensi es the molecular forces striking the membrane, which increases the amount of diffusion Osmosis is the passive movement of fl uid across a membrane from a region of low solute concentra- tion to a region of high solute concentration in an effort to maintain homeostasis Osmolality refers to the speci c gravity of body fl uids; the higher the speci c gravity, the greater the osmotic pressure, which attracts more water to the area Osmolality measures the number of dissolved particles per unit of water; normal osmolality of plasma is 280 to 294 mOsm/kg Active transport occurs when the cell membrane must move molecules against their concentration gradient; it requires energy (from cellular chemical reactions) and a carrier substance such as sodium Filtration is the movement of fl uid through a permeable membrane from a region of high pressure to a region of low pressure Plasma colloid osmotic pressure is the osmotic pressure caused by plasma proteins; it results from the selective retention of colloids in plasma, which lowers the concentration of water and electrolytes Acid-base imbalances /H18546General information An acid is any substance that can donate a hydrogen ion; a base is any substance that can accept or combine with a hydrogen ion Acid-base balance optimizes enzymatic function, nerve conduction, synaptic transmission, and muscle contraction (Text continues on page 79.)

Remember that in a mixed acid-base imbalance the etiology, signs and symptoms, and care will vary with the speci c imbalances involved. Description Cause Signs and symptoms Nursing care Metabolic acidosis Acid-base disturbance characterized by low pH, bicarbonate (HCO 3) ion de cit, and excess hydrogen ions in which the lungs compensate with hyperventilation to decrease the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (Pa CO2) concentrationConditions that in- crease acid production or absorption, such as impaired tissue perfu-sion, diabetes mellitus, salicylate poisoning, renal insuf ciency, methanol or ethylene glycol toxicity, and starvation Conditions that increase bicarbonate loss, such stupor, and coma Fruity breath Nausea and vomiting Increased respiratory rate and depth (classic Kussmaul's respirations) Hyperkalemia Warm, fl ushed skin Cardiac HCO3 under 22 mEq/L, and nor-mal Pa CO2 (34 to 44 mm Hg)Identify patients at risk for metabolic acidosis. Assess the patient for signs and symptoms of metabolic acidosis, especially respiratory, neurologic, electrolyte, and changes. Administer sodium bicar- bonate (NaHCO3) if necessary. Evaluate and correct fl uid and electrolyte imbalances. Administer medications for nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, as prescribed. If the patient is confused, take safety precautions. If the patient is diabetic, teach him and his family about blood glucose monitoring, diet, and drug administration. Treat the underlying cause\u2014for example, if diabetic ketoacidosis is the cause, administer insulin and fl uids. Metabolic alkalosis Acid-base disturbance characterized by high pH and excess HCO 3 and base in which the lungs compensate through hypoventilation to in-crease Pa CO2 Excessive removal or vomiting of gastric acid, nasogastric suctioning, or pyloric stenosis Hypokalemia Steroid or diuretic therapy relief of respiratory acidosis Cushing's syndrome or aldosteronism Excessive ngers toes, hyper-tonicity Compensatory hypoventilation with decreased respirations Decreased chloride and potassium levels Atrial tachycardia Confusion, irritability Diarrhea Nausea, vomiting Picking at bed clothes (carphology) pH above 7.45 and HCO3 above 26 mEq/L Identify patients at risk for metabolic alkalosis. Assess the patient for signs and symptoms of metabolic alkalosis, especially respiratory, electrolyte, and ABG changes. Replace electrolytes, such as potassium and chloride, as prescribed, and monitor levels regularly. Administer an acidifying agent, such as I.V. ammonium chloride. Replace fl uid volume, as prescribed. Administer an antiemetic, as prescribed. Prevent complications, such as hypoxemia caused by hypoventilation. Teach the patient and family how to correctly administer an antacid. Med-Surg_Chap06.indd 80 Med-Surg_Chap06.indd 81 (continued)Understanding acid-base imbalances (continued) Description Cause Signs and symptoms Nursing care Respiratory acidosis Acid-base disturbance characterized by ex-cessive carbonic acid (H 2CO3), elevated Pa CO2, and decreased serum pH that commonly is as-sociated with decreased oxygenation resulting Bronchial dia, and Warm, fl ushed skin, perspiration, and cyanosis pH below 7.35, Pa CO2 above 50 mm Hg, and normal or slightly ele-vated HCO 3 Chronic respiratory aci- dosis Weakness Dull headache pH below 7.35, Pa CO2 above 42 mm Hg, and HCO 3 above 26 mEq/L Symptoms of underly- ing disease, such as barrel chest and productive cough caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Identify patients at risk for respiratory acidosis. Identify factors that increase the risk of hypoventilation, such as obesity, postopera-tive pain, tight dressings, and abdominal distention. Assess the patient for signs and symptoms of respiratory acidosis, especially respiratory, pulse, and neurologic changes. If the patient has a chronic condition, make sure he doesn't receive more than 2 L of oxygen without an order. Relieve postoperative pain by administering the prescribed analgesic or teaching the patient relaxation techniques. Maintain an open airway; use suction if the patient can't cough up secretions. Encourage coughing, deep breathing, and ambulation in a postoperative patient. Perform chest physio- therapy. Maintain hydration to keep secretions loose. Provide food appropriate for the patient's ability to chew and swallow. If the patient has chronic respiratory acidosis, assist with routine pulmonary care. If the patient requires ven- tilator assistance, intervene as needed. Respiratory alkalosis Acid-base disturbance characterized by low H 2CO3 and Pa CO2 and caused by excessive \"blowing off\" of carbon dioxide during hyper-ventilation Extreme anxiety (most common cause) Pulmonary emboli, pulmonary brosis, asthma, pneumonia, or injury to the respiratory center Gram-negative bacte- remia and sepsis High fever Hypoxemia Hyperventilation exceeding 40 breaths/minute Cardiac arrhythmias that fail to to conventional treatment Circumoral or periph- eral paresthesia Carpopedal spasms Twitching (possibly progressing to tetany) Identify patients at risk for respiratory alkalosis. Assess the patient's anxiety level. Assess the patient for signs of respiratory alkalosis, espe-cially neurologic, electrolyte, and ABG changes. If the patient is anxious, encourage him to breathe slowly. Have him breathe into a paper bag to increase Pa CO2.

Determine whether the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (Pa CO2) is normal or shows acidosis or alkalosis. Determine whether the bicarbonate (HCO3) level is normal or shows acidosis or alkalosis. Determine whether the pH value matches the Pa CO2 (respiratory) or the HCO3 (metabolic) value. If the pH value is abnormal and the Pa CO2 value, the HCO3 value, or both are abnormal, the condition is uncompensated. If the pH value is normal and the Pa CO2 value and the HCO3 value are abnormal, the condition is compensated. Calculating BMI BMI = weight in pounds height in inches x height in inches x 703 OR BMI = weight in kilograms height in centimeters x height in centimeters x 10,000 OR BMI = weight in kilograms height in meters x height in metersYou can use one of the formulas below to calculate your patient's body mass index (BMI). Disruptions in homeostasis Nitrogen balance indicates the adequacy of protein intake To determine nitrogen balance, protein intake is measured in conjunction with 24-hour urinary urea nitrogen levels A negative nitrogen balance occurs when losses exceed intake /H18546Effects of malnutrition Immune function decreases and susceptibility to infection increases Wounds heal poorly and the risk of developing pressure ulcers increases Nutrient losses through the GI tract increase Muscle breakdown results in weakness and fatigue and increases the risk of multiple organ failure /H18546Malnutrition risks for the medical-surgical patient Underlying disease processes, such as malabsorption syndromes, gastric or bowel resections, pan- creatic insuf ciency, and vomiting and diarrhea, can interfere with the intake and use of nutrients (see Normal and hypermetabolic nutritional requirements ) Anorexia, dysphagia, prolonged or frequent nothing-by-mouth status, depression, and advanced age can contribute to inadequate intake of nutrients Nutrient losses occur with blood loss, wound drainage, and dialysis Increased nutrient needs can occur with the stress response, cancer, surgery, infection, trauma, and burns /H18546Therapeutic diets Clear liquid diets that minimize residue in the GI tract may be used before or after procedures The diet may include clear juices, broth, tea, popsicles, and soda Because this diet provides inadequate nutrients, it shouldn't be used for more than a few days Full liquid diets serve as an intermediate step between a clear liquid and a soft diet Foods include milk, milk shakes, yogurt, creamed soups, and liquid nutritional supplementsWhat BMI values mean Visceral proteins and their normal values The chart below shows half-life and normal values for visceral proteins.

Normal nutritional requirementsHypermetabolic nutritional requirements Total calories 25 kcal/kg/day 25 to 30 kcal/kg/day Protein calories 0.8 g/kg/day 1.2 to 1.5 g/kg/dayNonprotein calories 2 to 4 g carbohydrate/kg/day; 0.5 to 0.75 g fat/kg/day2 to 5 g carbohydrate/kg/day; 0.5 to 1.0 g Disruptions in homeostasis controlled location such as the pharmacy, and adhere to your facility's guidelines for formula, bag, and apparatus discard times Enteral feedings can result in a variety of complications To prevent the tube from becoming obstructed, gently fl ush the tube with 30 mL of warm tap water before and after feedings To reduce the risk of aspiration pneumonia, elevate the head of bed 30 degrees during feedings If you suspect that the nasoenteric tube has become dislocated, resulting in inadvertent respiratory tract infusion of formula, stop the feeding and check tube placement by X-ray or the pH of gastric secretions Secure the tube to minimize trauma to the insertion site and decrease the risk of insertion site infection or leakage leading to peritonitis Watch for GI complications, such as diarrhea, delayed gastric emptying, and constipation, as well as such complications as hyperglycemia and fl uid and electrolyte imbalance /H18546Parenteral nutrition Parenteral nutrition is appropriate for patients who require nutritional support for more than 10 days and for whom enteral feedings are contraindicated Peripheral venous nutrition (PVN) provides partial or total nutrition for up to 2 weeks; central venous nutrition (CVN) provides total nutrition for longer periods Both PVN and CVN contain a combination of glucose, amino acids, electrolytes, vitamins, and trace elements, with PVN having formulations of up to 10% glucose and less than 25% amino acids; greater concentrations of glucose and amino acids must be infused centrally Fat emulsions provide essential fatty acids and can be given either peripherally or centrally. T otal nutrient admixtures containing proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids in a single I.V. bag are available Four types of central access devices are available Nontunneled or percutaneous catheters such as subclavian lines are indicated for shorter-term nutritional support and can be inserted at the bedside Peripherally inserted central catheters (also called PICC lines) are intended for short-term use; these long catheters are inserted through a peripheral vein and advanced into the superior vena cava Tunneled catheters, such as the Hickman, Broviac, and Groshong, are intended for longer-term use; they're inserted surgically, with the distal end placed in the superior vena cava and the proximal end tunneled through the subcutaneous tissue of the chest wall to exit below the nipple line Implanted vascular access devices such as an implanted infusion port are implanted surgically and contain no external parts; instead, a catheter is placed in the subclavian or internal jugular vein and the access device is implanted in a subcutaneous pocket of the chest wall, with a special access needle used to cannulate the device intermittently Catheter placement should be con rmed by X-ray before initiating any infusions PVN and CVN are usually continuously infused with an infusion pump and a lter; a 0.22-micron lter should be used for CVN alone, and a 1.2-micron lter for CVN with lipids Parental nutrition can result in several complications Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, fl uid overload, and electrolyte imbalances can all occur Infection at the insertion site and sepsis can occur because the high glucose and fat concentrations of the solutions provide an ideal culture medium for bacterial and fungal growth The catheter can become occluded or dislodged Phlebitis can also occur An air embolism can cause such signs as tachypnea, altered mental status, and hypotension; if you suspect an air embolism, position the patient on his left side with his head down to allow bubbles to rise to the right atrium, where they're less likely to obstruct blood fl ow to the pulmonary artery /H18546Nursing interventions to improve nutritional outcomes Assess all medical-surgical patients for nutritional status upon admission and at least weekly after that; intervene as quickly as possible if you detect de cits Before discharge, teach patients about maintaining a healthy diet at home; take food preferences and socioeconomic conditions into account Med-Surg_Chap06.indd 86 Med-Surg_Chap06.indd 86 8/17/2011 3:43:17 PM 8/17/2011 3:43:17 PMObesity 87 Provide individualized nutritional strategies for special populations, such as vegetarians, bariatric surgery patients, and elderly patients For patients who will administer CVN at home, provide appropriate support and teaching to ensure that they and their caregivers understand the equipment required, how to care for the catheter, and how to monitor for complications on an ongoing basis Obesity The prevalence of obesity in the United States has increased markedly over the past 2 decades In 2009, only Colorado and the District of Columbia had obesity rates of less than 20% A total of 33 states had obesity rates of 25% or higher; 9 of these states had obesity rates of 30% or higher Excess weight substantially increases the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, certain types of can- cer, and other diseases, such as gynecologic abnormalities, osteoarthritis, and stress incontinence The risk of death from all causes in obese people is 50% to 100% greater than in people of normal weight Obesity can increase the risk of morbidity from other preexisting disorders Obese patients with existing coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, or sleep apnea are at high risk for developing disease-related complications that can lead to death Obesity is linked to complications during surgery, pregnancy, and labor and delivery A major contributor to preventable deaths, obesity also leads to low self-esteem, negative self-image, hopelessness, and negative social consequences, such as stereotyping, prejudice, social isolation, and discrimination Obese patients are more susceptibles to certain complications than nonobese patients The most common complications involve the pulmonary, cardiovascular, GI, and musculoskeletal systems (see Complications of obesity, page 88) Treatment of obesity can be long and dif cult; no single treatment method or combination of meth- ods is guaranteed to produce or maintain weight loss in all patients Treatment needs to combine diet therapy and increased physical activity A key element of the current recommendations is a moderate reduction in calories to achieve a slow, progressive weight loss of 1 to 2 lb (0.5 to 1 kg) per week; calories should be reduced only to the level required to achieve the goal weight Exercise plays a critical role in losing and maintaining body weight by increasing energy expendi- ture, maintaining or increasing lean body mass, and promoting fat loss Behavioral therapy serves as adjunct to planned decreases in food intake and increases in physical activity, with the goal of overcoming barriers to compliance with eating and activity habits Various behavior modi cation strategies must be used because no single method is superior Strategies for behavioral modi cation include self-monitoring, stress management, stimulus con- trol, problem solving, contingency management, cognitive restructuring, and social support If the patient hasn't lost the recommended 1 lb (0.5 kg) per week after 6 months of diet and increased physical activity, drug therapy may be considered Not every patient responds to drug therapy; tests show that initial responders tend to continue to respond, whereas nonresponders are less likely to respond, even with increases in dosage If adverse effects are unmanageable or if therapy is ineffective, drug therapy should be stopped Patients experiencing complications from severe, resistant obesity may bene t from weight-loss sur- gery if the risk for remaining obese is greater than the risk for surgery Restrictive and malabsorptive-restrictive are the two types of surgeries primarily used to promote weight loss In gastric restriction-also known as vertical banded gastroplasty and adjustable gastric banding-the size of the stomach is surgically decreased so that a patient feels full after eating a small amount of food Malabsorptive-restrictive procedures, which reduce stomach size as well as the number of calories and nutrients the body can absorb, produce better weight-loss results than gastric resection; two types of malabsorptive-restrictive weight-loss surgeries currently performed are the gastric bypass (also known as a Roux-en-Y bypass) and biliopancreatic diversion in homeostasis Obese patients typically have more complications that affect various body systems. Here are some of the more common complications along with their pathophysiology and related nursing interventions.

Reposition the patient at least every 2 hours. Monitor skin folds for pressure ulcers or skin breakdown. Work with a dietitian to ensure that metabolic needs are met for proper healing. Musculoskeletal Increased joint trauma Decreased mobility Increased atrophy from lack of use Increased pain with movement Osteoarthritis Rheumatoid arthritis Encourage mobilization. Perform range-of- motion exercises with the patient. Provide nonpharmacologic pain-relief measures.Complications obesity in homeostasis Alcohol withdrawal delirium usually peaks within 2 to 3 days and is always considered a medical emergency Signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal delirium include autonomic hyperactivity, severe disturbance in sensorium, perceptual disturbance, fl uctuating LOC, delusions, agitated behaviors, and fever /H18546Substance abuse Commonly abused CNS stimulants include cocaine and amphetamines Intoxication with CNS stimulants typically causes tachycardia, dilated pupils, increased blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, and insomnia Overdose with CNS stimulants can cause respiratory distress, ataxia, hyperpyrexia, convulsions, coma, stroke, MI, and death Signs and symptoms of withdrawal include fatigues, depression, agitation, apathy, anxiety, sleepi- ness, disorientation, lethargy, and craving Treatment for individuals with substance abuse includes an assessment phase, treatment of the intoxication and withdrawal when necessary, and the development and implementation of an overall treatment strategy Treatment should include an both an interdisciplinary care team and family members; the patient and family should also as receive referrals to support groups Pain /H18546General information Pain is a complex phenomenon that involves biological, psychological, cultural, and social factors; it's a primarily subjective experience Margo McCaffery, a pain researcher, de nes pain as \"whatever the experiencing person says it is, existing whenever the experiencing person says it does\" The International Association on Pain de nes pain as unpleasant sensory and emotional experiences related to actual or potential tissue damage /H18546Pain theories All current pain-control theories are hypothetical; none completely explain the pain experience and all its components The speci city theory holds that highly speci c structures and pathways exist for pain transmission; this biologically oriented theory doesn't explain pain tolerance and ignores social, cultural, and empiri-cal factors that infl uence pain The pattern theory holds that rapid and slow conduction pathways exist, which relay pain information through the spinal cord to the brain; although this theory addresses the brain's ability to determine the amount, intensity, and type of sensory input, it doesn't address nonbiological infl uences on pain per- ception and transmission The gate control theory describes a hypothetical gate mechanism in the spinal cord that allows nerve bers to receive pain sensations; the gate can be closed to pain sensation by occupying the receptor sites with other stimuli This theory has encouraged a holistic approach to pain control and research by considering non- biological components of pain Pain management techniques, such as cutaneous stimulation, distraction, and acupuncture, are partly based on this theory /H18546Anatomic and physiologic basis of pain Stimulation of pain receptors in skin and soft tissues typically causes de ned, localized pain Stimulation of pain receptors in deep tissues causes dull, poorly localized pain Stimulation of pain receptors in the viscera or organs causes diffuse, sometimes referred pain Pain can be stimulated by mechanical sources such as sharp objects; thermal sources such as re; or chemical sources, such as stomach acids and battery acid Pain travels from the periphery to the spinal cord to the brain by way of a pathway composed of A (delta) bers (intense pain) and C bers (dull, aching pain) Med-Surg_Chap06.indd 90 8/17/2011 3:43:17 PM 8/17/2011 3:43:17 in the midbrain, and cortex Certain neurotransmitters, such as histamine, serotonin, and prostaglandins, enhance pain impulse transmission Other neurotransmitters, such as endogenous opiates, endorphins, and enkephalins, inhibit pain impulse transmission; chronic pain syndrome may be related to a de ciency of these inhibitory neurotransmitters /H18546Factors that affect pain response Pain is primarily a physical problem that has psychological effects The physical and psychological sources of pain are often complex and intertwined, with causative factors dif cult to isolate Psychogenic pain is pain without a physiologic basis; this term isn't helpful because all physical causes of pain can't be diagnosed, and all pain is real to the patient Pain threshold is the point at which a patient experiences pain Pain tolerance is affected by individual, psychosocial, cultural, religious, and environmental factors; it infl uences pain duration and intensity Pain assessment /H18546General information Pain can be assessed with a subjective pain assessment tool 0 to 10 rating scale: The patient is asked to rate pain on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable Face rating scale: The patient is shown illustrations of ve or more faces demonstrating varying levels of emotion, from happy to sad; by selecting the face that most closely approximates the pain sensation, the patient helps the nurse gauge the effectiveness of interventions Visual analog scale: The patient places a mark on the scale, ranging from no pain to pain as bad as it can be, to indicate his current level of pain Body diagram: The patient draws the location and radiation of pain on a paper illustration of the body Questionnaire: The patient answers questions about the pain's location, intensity, quality, onset, and relieving and aggravating factors Pain fl ow chart: The nurse documents variations in pain, vital signs, and LOC in response to treat- ments; these forms are particularly useful for monitoring patient response to epidural opioid infu-sions and for titrating dosages Pain also can be assessed by observing for objective signs, such as facial grimacing; elevated blood pressure and increased pulse and respiratory rates; muscle tension; restlessness or an inability to concentrate; decreased interest in surroundings and increased focus on pain; perspiration and pallor; crying, moaning, or verbalizations of pain; and guarding the painful body part /H18546Pain classi cation Acute pain is mild to severe pain that's rapid in onset and lasts less than 6 months; it can be intermit- tent or recurrent as in migraine and sinus headaches and gallbladder colic Chronic pain lasts beyond the expected healing time and may be dif cult to relate to the original injury or tissue damage; it can be further classi ed as chronic benign pain (as in lower back pain), chronic cancer pain, or pain with ongoing peripheral pathology /H18546Pharmacologic management of pain Nonopioid drugs, such as nonsteroidal anti-infl ammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen, are used to treat acute pain caused by infl ammation or tissue destruction and mild to moderate pain; they're useful adjuncts to opioid analgesics for pain Opioid analgesics such as narcotic agonist-antagonists relieve pain by occupying opioid receptor sites in the brain and spinal cord; they're used to treat moderate to severe acute pain (postoperative pain and fractures), recurrent acute pain (sickle cell crisis, angina, and renal colic), prolonged time- limited pain (cancer and burns), and pain that requires rapid, short-term relief (procedures such as bone marrow biopsy and thoracentesis) Sometimes small doses of antidepressants are used as adjuncts to pain control; they affect pain per- ception and reduce the accompanying 3:43:17 PM 8/17/2011 3:43:17 PM92 Disruptions in homeostasis The oral route of administration is the least expensive, easiest for patients to manage, and most widely accepted by patients; most NSAIDs and some opioids can be administered orally Parenteral routes (subcutaneous [Subcut], I.M., I.V.) are widely used administer opioids Intraspinal (epidural) routes are used for short-term acute pain, such as that caused by abdominal surgery; the opioid's systemic effect is reduced with the intraspinal route compared with other paren-teral routes Topical patches, such as those containing fentanyl, are useful during the transition from epidural to oral opioids Rectal administration of opioids may be indicated when a patient can't tolerate oral medications temporarily because of nausea and vomiting Patient-controlled analgesia is the I.V ., Subcut, or intraspinal administration of opioids by means of an electronic controller that's programmed to respond with small doses when the patient requests medication Scheduled dosing is preferred to \"as needed\"; around-the-clock dosing controls pain by avoiding the major peaks and valleys of the pain experience /H18546Nonpharmacologic management of pain Cutaneous stimulation is a low-risk, inexpensive, noninvasive, readily available pain management technique that requires little skill to implement; examples include heat application, cold application, massage, pressure, vibration, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (the application of electric current through skin patches connected to a portable electrical source) Therapeutic touch unblocks congested areas of energy in the body; in this technique, the practitioner redirects energy by using touch to promote comfort, relaxation, healing, and a sense of well-being Acupuncture is the use of needles of various sizes to stimulate parts of the body to produce analgesia; this centuries-old technique originated in China and is gaining acceptance in Western medicine Cognitive and behavioral pain management uses imagery, distraction, relaxation techniques, and humor to help patients manage pain Biofeedback teaches patients to control involuntary body mechanisms, such as heart rate, muscle spasms, and circulation /H18546Surgical management of pain Surgery seldom is used as a primary treatment for pain but can be considered to manage pain when pharmacalogic therapies fail Nerve blocks involve the injection of phenol or alcohol to destroy nerve endings in a speci c area Rhizotomy is the surgical destruction of sensory nerve roots where they enter the spinal cord; chordotomy is the transection of spinal cord nerves at the spinal cord's midline portion Neurectomy is the resection or partial or total excision of a spinal or cranial nerve Cryoanalgesia deactivates a nerve using a cooled probe that causes temporary nerve injury Radio-frequency lesioning may affect the nerve from the heat generated, the magnetic eld created by the radio waves, or both Percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation uses implanted leads and a surface stimulator or implanted generator to block pain impulses by delivering electric charges to a nerve root Spinal nerve blocks, rhizotomy, and chordotomy can impair bladder, bowel, and sexual functioning /H18546Nursing care of the patient in pain Assess the pain's location, and ask the patient to rate the pain using a pain scale Ask the patient to describe the pain's quality and pattern, including any precipitating or relieving factors Monitor vital signs and note subjective responses to pain, such as facial grimacing and guarding of a body part Administer pain medication around the clock as ordered Provide comfort measures, such as back massage, positioning, linen changes, and oral or skin care Teach the patient noninvasive techniques to control pain, such as relaxation, guided imagery, distrac- tion, and cutaneous stimulation Teach the importance of taking prescribed analgesics before the pain becomes severe Instruct the patient on the need for adequate rest periods and sleep Med-Surg_Chap06.indd 92 Med-Surg_Chap06.indd 92 8/17/2011 3:43:17 PM 8/17/2011 3:43:17 93 /H18546Referral to a pain clinic or hospice Patients with chronic benign pain that can't be controlled by nonpharmacologic interventions may bene t from treatment at a pain clinic The clinic's interdisciplinary staff works with the patient to assess the pain and develops a pain- control regimen that helps the patient regain or maintain an acceptable level of functioning Hospice programs give care and support to dying patients and their families; pain control\u2014one of the primary goals\u2014provides the patient with adequate pain relief at home Review questions 1. The nurse is teaching a group of patient care attendants about infectioncontrol measures. The nurse tells the group that the rst line of intervention for preventing the spread of infection is: /H18540A. wearing gloves. /H18540B. administering antibiotics. /H18540C. hand hygiene. /H18540D. assigning private rooms for patients. Correct answer: C Hand hygiene is the rst line of intervention for preventing the spread of infec- tion. Option B is incorrect because antibiotics should be initiated only when an organism is identi ed. Although wearing gloves (Option A) and assigning private rooms (Option D) can also decrease the spread of infection, they should be implemented according to standard precautions when indicated. 2. The nurse is caring for a patient who was given pain medication before leaving the recovery room. Upon returning to his room, the patient states that he is still experiencing pain and requests more pain medication. Of the following actions, which is the rst for the nurse to take? /H18540A. Tell the patient that he must wait 4 hours for more pain medication. /H18540B. Give half of the ordered as-needed dose. /H18540C. Document the patient's pain. /H18540D. Notify the practitioner that the patient is still experiencing pain. Correct answer: D The practitioner should be noti ed that the patient is still experiencing pain so that new medication orders can be established. Option A is incorrect because patients who have recently undergone surgery shouldn't have to wait 4 hours for pain relief. Option B is incorrect because a nurse can't alter a dose without rst consulting the practitioner; doing so could result in a nurse being charged with practicing medicine without a license. Although the nurse should document the patient's pain, Option C, it isn't the rst action the nurse should take. 3. A patient is admitted to the health care facility with a possible electrolyte imbalance. The patient is disori- ented and weak, has an irregular pulse, and takes hydrochlorothiazide. The patient most and symptoms of hypokalemia include GI, cardiac, renal, respiratory, and neurologic symptoms. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because the use of a potassium-wasting diuretic, such as hydrochlorothiazide, without potassium supplement therapy Disruptions in homeostasis 4. The nurse is assessing a patient who may be in the early stages of dehydration. Early signs and symptoms of dehydration include: /H18540A. coma and seizures. /H18540B. sunken eyeballs and poor skin turgor. /H18540C. increased heart rate with hypotension. /H18540D. thirst and confusion. Correct answer: D Early signs and symptoms of dehydration include thirst, irritability, confusion, and dizziness. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because coma, seizures, sunken eyeballs, poor skin turgor, and increased heart rate with hypotension are all later signs and symptoms of dehydration. 5. The nurse is evaluating a postoperative patient for infection. Which sign or symptom would be most indicative of infection? /H18540A. Presence of an indwelling urinary catheter /H18540B. Rectal temperature of 100\u00b0 F (37.8\u00b0 C) /H18540C. Redness, warmth, and tenderness at the incision site /H18540D. WBC count of 8,000/ mL Correct answer: C Redness, warmth, and tenderness at the incision site would lead the nurse to suspect a postoperative infection. Option A is incorrect because the presence of an invasive device predisposes a patient to infection but alone doesn't indicate infection. Option B is incorrect because a rectal temperature of 100\u00b0 F is a normal nding in a postoperative patient because of the infl ammatory response. Option D is incorrect because a normal WBC count ranges from 4,000 to 10,000/ mL. 6. When planning the postoperative care of a patient who underwent surgery for repair of a lacerated spleen after an alcohol-related motor vehicle accident, what intervention should take priority in the immediate post-operative period? /H18540A. Monitoring the patient for signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal /H18540B. Encouraging early ambulation /H18540C. Splinting the abdomen for coughing and deep-breathing exercise /H18540D. Monitoring the patient's renal function Correct answer: A The nurse's priority should be monitoring the patient for signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal because alcohol withdrawal usually manifests several hours after the last intake of alcohol. Early recognition of withdrawal symptoms helps prevent progression into alcohol withdrawal delirium. Although encouraging early ambulation (Option B), splinting the abdomen (Option C), and monitoring the patient's renal function (Option D) are important nursing interventions, they don't take priority in the immediate postoperative period. 7. Which diet would be most appropriate for a patient with ulcerative colitis? /H18540A. A low-fat A high-calorie diet /H18540D. A high- ber diet Correct answer B A low-residue diet is used to avoid GI tract irritation and decrease fecal volume, appropriate measures for a patient with ulcerative colitis. Such a patient doesn't need to follow a low-fat diet (Option A) or to consume additional calories (Option C). A patient with ulcerative colitis should avoid a high- ber diet (Option D), which contains such foods as whole grain cereals and fruit.

The nurse performs a nutritional assessment on a patient with lung cancer who is in the postoperative period after a lobectomy. Which of the following could be an early sign of malnutrition? /H18540A. A retinal-binding protein level of 2.0 mg/dL /H18540B. Dry, fl aky, discolored skin and brittle nails /H18540C. A body mass index (BMI) of 20 /H18540D. An albumin level of 3.0 g/dL Correct answer A Retinal-binding protein has a half-life of 12 hours, so a decrease from the normal val- ues of 2.6 to 7.6 mg/dL could be an early sign of malnutrition. Dry, fl aky, discolored skin and brittle nails (Option B) are later signs of malnutrition. A BMI of 20 (Option C) falls in the normal range. Albumin has a half-life of 20 days so, although a value of 3.0 g/dL (Option D) would be a decrease from the normal values of 3.5 to 5 g/dL, it would be a later sign of malnutrition. 9. The two types of surgery primarily used to promote weight loss are restrictive and malabsorptive-restric- tive. Which of the following is an example of restrictive weight-loss surgery? /H18540A. diversion Correct answer: B Adjustable gastric banding is a type of gastric restriction weight-loss surgery. Mal- absorptive-restrictive procedures include gastric bypass (Option A) (also known as a Roux-en-Y bypass [Option C]) and biliopancreatic diversion (Option D). 10. In what type of electrolyte imbalance would the nurse observe tall, tented T waves; a widened QRS com- plex; and a show tall, tented T waves; a widened QRS complex; and a prolonged PR interval. In hypokalemia (Option A) the ECG will show a fl at ST segment and Q wave. Hypocalcemia (Option B) and hypercalcemia (Option C) won't show T wave, QRS, or PR interval changes on the ECG.

Follow the same auscultation se-quence during every cardiovascular assessment: First, place the stethoscope in the second intercostal space along the right sternal border, as shown. In the aortic area, blood moves from the left ventricle during systole, crossing the aortic valve and fl owing through the aortic arch. Then move to the pulmonic area, located in the second intercostal space at the left sternal border. In the pulmonic area, blood ejected from the right ventricle during systole crosses the pulmonic valve and fl ows through the main pulmonary artery. Next, listen at Erb's point, located in the third intercostal space at the left sternal border. At Erb's point, you'll hear aortic and pulmonic sounds. At the fourth auscultation site, listen over the tricuspid area, which lies in the fth intercostal space along the left sternal border. In the tricuspid area, sounds refl ect blood movement from the right atrium across the tricuspid valve, lling the right ventricle during diastole. Finally, listen in the mitral area, located in the fth intercostal space near the midclavicular line. (If the patient's heart is enlarged, the mitral area may be closer to the anterior axil-lary line.) In the mitral (apical) area, sounds represent blood fl ow across the mitral valve and left ventricular ll- ing during diastole.Auscultatory sequence 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 92Aortic area Pulmonic area Erb's point Tricuspid area Mitral area /H18546Physical assessment The nurse begins with inspection Observe the patient's general appearance: Is he thin, cachectic, or obese? Is he alert or anxious? What's his respiratory rate and breathing pattern? Check his hair distribution Note the skin color: Is it pink, pale, or cyanotic? Note any clubbing, edema, and skin lesions Observe the chest and thorax: The lateral diameter should be twice the anteroposterior diameter; note any deviations from the typical chest shape Inspect the neck for visible pulsations and jugular vein distention Look for pulsations, symmetry of movement, retractions, or heaves; note the location of the apical impulse Next, the nurse uses palpation Palpate the precordium for heaves, thrills, and the point maximum impulse; also palpate Palpate pulses in the extremities and neck for strength, rhythm, and equality Palpate the extremities for skin temperature, edema, capillary re ll time, and turgor Then the nurse percusses the heart Percuss the left border of the heart, noting the sound change from resonance to dullness Try to percuss the right border of the heart; in most people, it's under the sternum and can't be percussed The nurse continues by auscultating the heart and vessels Use the diaphragm of the stethoscope to listen over the mitral or apical area for 1 minute; note heart rate and rhythm Proceed sequentially through the auscultatory landmarks and listen for rst and second heart sounds (S1 and S2) (see Auscultatory 8:16:44 PM98 Cardiovascular disorders Listen for extra sounds, such as a third and fourth heart sound (S3 and S4), murmurs, clicks, snaps, and rubs Repeat the sequence, using the bell of the stethoscope An S3 (ventricular gallop) is low pitched and best heard over, the apex of the heart; the rhythm is similar to a horse gallop, and the cadence sounds like \"Kentucky\" An S4 occurs during atrial contraction, just before S1; its cadence sounds like \"Tennessee\" The S3 and S4 sounds are best heard with the bell of the stethoscope placed at the apical area while the patient is supine or lying on his left side Auscultate for bruits over the abdominal aorta and the carotid and femoral arteries Acute coronary syndrome /H18546Description Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) includes three major thrombotic effects of CAD and the resulting myocardial ischemia infarction (non-STEMI) STEMI ACS results when a rupture or erosion of plaque occurs in one or more coronary arteries, resulting in platelet adhesions, activation of thrombin, and clot formation, reducing myocardial blood fl ow ACS requires prompt evaluation to differentiate noncardiac pain from cardiac pain, so proper treat- ment can be quickly initiated Complications of myocardial infarction (MI) may include heart failure, mitral aneurysm is a localized or diffuse dilation of the wall of the aorta, particularly the abdomi- nal aorta below the renal arteries Causes of aortic aneurysm include atherosclerosis, severe hypertension, pregnancy (when hormonal changes affect the smooth muscle and media of the aorta), trauma, congenital abnormalities, infectious arteritis, syphilis, and Marfan syndrome (which increases aortic wall elasticity) /H18546Signs and symptoms An abdominal aortic aneurysm may cause abdominal pulsations, abdominal aortic bruit, abdominal aching, dull lower back pain with radiation to fl ank and groin, nausea, and vomiting;

their effect on cardiac output and blood pressure, partially infl uenced by the site of origin, determines their clinical signi cance (see The 8-step method of rhythm strip analysis ) Causes of arrhythmias include congenital heart disease, degeneration of the conduction system, drug effects or toxicity, heart disease, myocardial ischemia, stress, alcohol, electrolyte imbalance, acid-base imbalances, cellular hypoxia, and conditions such as anemia, anorexia, thyroid dysfunction, adrenal insuf ciency, and pulmonary disease (see Cardiac arrhythmias, pages 104 to 106) /H18546Signs and symptoms The patient with an arrhythmia may be asymptomatic or may report palpitations, chest pain, dizziness, weakness, fatigue, and feelings of impending doom Other signs and symptoms include an irregular heart rhythm, bradycardia or tachycardia, hypotension, syncope, reduced level of consciousness, diaphoresis, pallor, nausea, vomiting, and cold, clammy skin Life-threatening arrhythmias may result in pulselessness, absence of respirations, and no palpable blood pressure /H18546Nursing interventions Monitor the pulse for an irregular pattern or an abnormally rapid or slow rate; if the patient is receiv- ing continuous cardiac monitoring, observe him for arrhythmias Assess the patient for signs and symptoms of hemodynamic compromise If the patient has an arrhythmia, promptly assess his airway, breathing, and circulation Initiate basic life support measures if indicated, until other advanced cardiac life support measures are available and successful Perform de brillation early for ventricular tachycardia and ventricular brillation Administer medications as needed, and prepare for medical procedures (for example, cardioversion or pacemaker insertion) if indicated Monitor the patient for fl uid and electrolyte imbalance and signs of drug toxicity, especially digoxin; correct the underlying cause and adjust medications as needed Provide adequate oxygen and reduce the heart's workload, while carefully maintaining metabolic, neurologic, respiratory, and hemodynamic status Step 1: Determine rhythm To determine the heart's atrial and ventricular rhythms, use either the pen-and-pencil method or the caliper method. To determine the atrial rhythm, measure the P-P inter- vals, the intervals between consecutive P waves. These intervals should occur regularly, with only small variations associated with respirations. Then compare the P-P intervals in several cycles. Consistently similar P-P intervals indicate regular atrial rhythm; dissimilar P-P intervals indicate irregu-lar atrial rhythm. To determine the ventricular rhythm, measure the intervals between two consecutive R waves in the QRS complexes. If an R wave isn't present, use either Q waves or S waves of consecutive QRS complexes. The R-R intervals should occur regularly. Then compare the R-R intervals in several cycles. As with atrial rhythms, consistently similar intervals mean a regular rhythm; dissimilar intervals point to an irregular rhythm. After completing your measurements, ask yourself: Is the rhythm regular or irregular? Consider a rhythm with only slight variations (up to 0.04 second) to be regular. If the rhythm is irregular, is it slightly irregular or markedly irregular? Does the irregularity occur in a pattern (a regu-larly irregular pattern)?The 8-step method of rhythm strip analysis Rhythm strip analysis requires a sequential and systematic approach. The following eight steps provide a good outline for you to follow.(Text continues on page 106.) Med-Surg_Chap07.indd 102 Med-Surg_Chap07.indd 102 8/3/2011 8:16:45 PM 8/3/2011 8:16:45 PMArrhythmias 103 Step 2: Calculate rate You can use one of three methods to determine the atrial and ventricular heart rates from an electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform. Although these methods can provide accurate information, you shouldn't rely solely on them when as-sessing your patient. Keep in mind that the ECG waveform represents electrical, not mechanical, activity. Therefore, al-though an ECG can show that ventricular depolarization has occurred, it doesn't mean that ventricular contraction has oc-curred. To determine this, you must assess the patient's pulse. Times-ten method . The simplest, quickest, and most common way to calculate rate is the times-ten method, especially if the rhythm is irregular. ECG paper is marked in increments of 3 seconds, or 15 large boxes. To calculate the atrial rate, obtain a 6-second strip, count the number of P waves that appear on it, and multiply this number by 10. Ten 6-second strips equal 1 minute. Calculate the ventricular rate the same way, using the R waves. 1,500 method . If the heart rhythm is regular, use the 1,500 method, so named because 1,500 small squares equal 1 minute. Count the number of small squares between iden-tical points on two consecutive P waves, and then divide 1,500 by that number to determine the atrial rate. To obtain the ventricular rate, use the same method with two con-secutive R waves. Sequence method . The third method of estimating heart rate is the sequence method, which requires memorizing a sequence of numbers. For the atrial rate, nd a P wave that peaks on a heavy black line, and assign the following numbers to the next six heavy black lines: 300, 150, 100, 75, 60, and 50. Then nd the next P-wave peak, and estimate the atrial rate, based on the number assigned to the nearest heavy black line. Estimate the ventricular rate the same way, using the R wave. Step 3: Evaluate P waves When examining a rhythm strip for P waves, ask yourself: Are P waves present? Do the P waves have a normal con guration? Do all of the P waves have a similar size and shape? Is there one P wave for every QRS complex? Step 4: Determine PR interval duration To measure the PR interval, count the small squares be- tween the start of the P wave and the start of the QRS com-plex; then multiply the number of squares by 0.04 second. After you perform this calculation, ask yourself: Does the duration of the PR interval fall within normal limits, 0.12 to 0.20 second (or 3 to 5 small squares)? Is the PR interval constant?Step 5: Determine QRS complex duration When determining QRS complex duration, make sure to measure straight across from the end of the PR interval to the end of the S wave, not just to the peak. Remember, the QRS complex has no horizontal components. To calculate duration, count the number of small squares between the beginning and the end of the QRS complex, and multiply this number by 0.04 second. Then ask yourself the following questions: Does the duration of the QRS complex fall within normal limits, 0.06 to 0.10 second? Are all QRS complexes the same size and shape? (If not, measure each one and describe them individually.) Does a QRS complex appear after every P wave? Step 6: Evaluate T wave Examine the T waves on the ECG strip. Then ask yourself: Are T waves present? Do all of the T waves have a normal shape? Could a P wave be hidden in a T wave? Do all of the T waves have a normal amplitude? Do the T waves have the same defl ection as the QRS complexes? Step 7: Determine QT interval duration Count the number of small squares between the beginning of the QRS complex and the end of the T wave, where the T wave returns to the baseline. Multiply this number by 0.04 second. Ask yourself: Does the duration of the QT interval fall within normal limits, 0.36 to 0.44 second? Step 8: Evaluate other components Note the presence of ectopic or aberrantly conducted beats or other abnormalities. Also, check the ST segment for ab-normalities, and look for the presence of a U wave. Next, interpret your ndings by classifying the rhythm strip according to one or all of the following features: Site of origin of the rhythm . For example, sinus node, atria, atrioventricular node, or ventricles. Rate . Normal (60 to 100 beats/minute), bradycardia (less than 60 beats/minute), or tachycardia (greater than 100 beats/minute). Rhythm . Normal or abnormal; for example, fl utter, brilla- tion, heart block, escape rhythm, or other arrhythmias.The 8-step method of rhythm strip analysis (continued) 103 8/3/2011 8:16:45 PM 8/3/2011 disorders Normal sinus rhythm Ventricular and atrial rates of 60 to 100 beats/minute (BPM) QRS complexes and P waves regular and uniform PR interval 0.12 to 0.2 second Duration of QRS complex < 0.12 second Identical atrial and ventricular rates, with constant PR interval Sinus tachycardia Description Rate > 100 BPM; rarely > 160 BPM Every QRS complex follows a P wave Treatment Correction of underlying cause; a beta-adrenergic blocker or calcium channel blocker, if symptomatic or car-diac related Sinus bradycardia Description Rate < 60 BPM QRS complex follows each P wave Treatment For low cardiac output, dizziness, weakness, altered level of conscious-ness, or low blood pressure, advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) protocol for administration of atropine I.V.

it's the most common form of obstructive disease after age 30 Other causes of arterial occlusive disease include thrombosis, embolism, and arteritis Risk factors include smoking, advanced age, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and genetic predisposition In arterial partially or completely occlude arteries; the aorta and its major branches, along with the carotid, vertebral, femoral, iliac, and other arteries, may be involved; arteries in the legs are the most commonly affected This disorder produces symptoms when the arteries can no longer provide enough blood to supply oxygen and nutrients to the limbs and remove the waste products of metabolism /H18546Signs and symptoms Acute arterial occlusion may produce the following ve classic signs: paralysis, pain, paresthesia, pallor, and pulselessness Other characteristic symptoms of arterial occlusive disease include intermittent claudication and pain in the affected limb that occurs with exercise and is relieved with rest Med-Surg_Chap07.indd 106 Med-Surg_Chap07.indd 106 8/3/2011 8:16:47 PM 8/3/2011 8:16:47 PMBuerger's disease 107 Signs and symptoms can also include cool feet and hands with poor hair growth, differences in the color and size of the lower legs, altered arterial pulsations and bruits over the affected area, ischemic ulcers, a burning sensation in the feet and toes, changes to nails, and decreased or absent pulses /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnostic tests may include arteriography, Doppler ultrasonography, CT scan, and MRI Treatment aims to prevent circulatory compromise Patients are encouraged to stop smoking They're encouraged to exercise, eat a proper diet, and lose weight, if necessary They're advised on proper posture and the need to wear nonconstrictive clothing Medications such as pentoxifylline may be prescribed to improve blood fl ow through the capillaries Hypertension is controlled through drug therapy and lifestyle modi cations An antilipemic may be necessary to lower elevated cholesterol levels; antiplatelets may also be pre- scribed along with antihypertensives Thrombolytic therapy may be given to treat arterial thrombosis Surgery is used to correct the obstruction if the disease progresses rapidly and the patient otherwise is in good health Angioplasty and laser therapy may be performed to reestablish blood fl ow Bypass grafting may use an arti cial or autologous graft Patch grafting replaces a damaged segment of the artery with a vein patch Endarterectomy strips plaques from the intimal lining /H18546Nursing interventions Check arterial pulses frequently Have the patient sleep with the head of the bed slightly elevated to aid perfusion to the lower extremities Don't massage the affected extremities because massage could further damage tissue Tell the patient to dress warmly and to avoid exposing the affected extremity to extreme temperatures Discuss gradual exercise programs, proper diet, and skin care Perform appropriate postoperative care Assess the affected extremity and check distal and proximal pulses Maintain the patient on bed rest for 12 to 24 hours after surgery Avoid sharp fl exion of the affected extremity Assess for signs and symptoms of infection Buerger's disease /H18546Description Buerger's disease, occlusive condition that causes segmental lesions and subsequent thrombus formation in the small and medium arteries (and sometimes the veins), resulting in decreased blood fl ow to the feet and legs It usually occurs in men between ages 20 and 30 and in heavy smokers /H18546Signs and symptoms Buerger's disease typically causes intermittent claudication of the instep or legs, which is aggravated by exercise and relieved by rest Pulses are diminished or absent, and the patient may experience coldness, numbness, tingling, or burning in the affected extremity As the disease progresses, redness, heat, tingling, or cyanosis may appear when the extremity is in a dependent position, and ulcers and gangrene may appear /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnostic tests may disorders For patients severe disease, lumbar sympathectomy may improve blood fl ow through vasodilation Amputation may be necessary for nonhealing ulcers, intractable pain, or gangrene Vasodilator therapy hasn't proved to be effective, but pentoxifylline (Pentoxil), calcium channel blockers, and thromboxane inhibitors may be helpful, especially if vasospasm is present /H18546Nursing interventions Warn the patient that he must stop smoking to avoid worsening of his symptoms Tell him to avoid excessive cold temperatures to reduce vasoconstriction Avoid the use of vasoconstricting medications Teach the patient to take measures to protect the extremities from trauma and infection Encourage the patient to participate in progressive exercise Cardiomyopathy /H18546Description Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle, reducing cardiac output and eventually resulting in heart failure Cardiomyopathy is classi ed according to the structural and functional abnormalities of the heart muscle; types include dilated, or congestive (most common form; dilated cardiac chambers contract poorly, causing blood to pool and thrombi to form); hypertrophic obstructive (hypertrophied left ven-tricle is small, unable to relax and ll properly); restrictive (rare form; stiff ventricles are resistant to lling); right ventricular; and unclassi ed Causes of dilated cardiomyopathy include chronic alcoholism, viral or bacterial infection, metabolic and immunologic disorders, and pregnancy and postpartum disorders; causes of hypertrophic car- diomyopathy include congenital disorders and hypertension; restrictive cardiomyopathy may be idio-pathic, or it may stem from amyloidosis, cancer, or heart transplant; arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy most likely has a genetic cause and results from the in ltration of brous and adipose tissue into the myocardium; unclassi ed cardiomyopathy doesn't t into other categories and can have various causes /H18546Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms of heart failure are present, including tachycardia, S3 and S4 heart sounds, exer- tional dyspnea, paroxysmal cyanosis, and hepatomegaly Heart murmurs and arrhythmias may also occur /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnostic tests include electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, cardiac catheterization, radionu- clide studies, and chest X-ray Medications for dilated cardiomyopathy include an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or hydralazine plus a nitrate (the mainstay of therapy), a beta-adrenergic blocker, digoxin, a diuretic, and an anticoagulant Medications for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy include a beta-adrenergic blocker and a calcium chan- nel blocker No speci c medications are used to treat restrictive cardiomyopathy; however, diuretics, digoxin, nitrates, and other vasodilators can worsen the condition and should be avoided An antiarrhythmic, a pacemaker, or an implantable cardiac de brillator may be necessary to control arrhythmias Surgery, such as heart transplantation or cardiomyoplasty (for dilated cardiomyopathy) or ventricu- lar myotomy or cardiomyopathy) may be indicated if medica-tions fail /H18546Nursing interventions Monitor ECG results, cardiovascular status, vital signs, and hemodynamic variables to detect heart failure and arrhythmias and assess the patient's response to medications 108 8/3/2011 8:16:48 PM 8/3/2011 8:16:48 PMCoronary artery disease 109 If the patient is receiving a diuretic, monitor his serum electrolyte levels to detect abnormalities such as hypokalemia Administer oxygen and keep the patient in semi-Fowler's position to promote oxygenation Make sure the patient restricts activity if necessary to reduce oxygen demands on the heart Teach the patient the signs and symptoms of heart failure he should report to the practitioner Explain the importance of checking his weight daily and reporting an increase of 3 lb (1.4 kg) or more (1 liter of fl uid equals 1 kg or 2.2 lb) Encourage the patient to express his feelings such as a fear of dying Coronary artery disease /H18546Description In CAD, plaques partially or totally occlude the coronary artery vasculature; it's the leading cause of death and disease in the United States Some risk factors for CAD can't be modi ed: old age, male gender, and family history of heart disease Other risk factors can be modi ed: increased levels CAD begins when endothelial cells in the arterial lining are injured, making them permeable to lipo- proteins Clot-forming platelets adhere to the injury site, and lipoproteins build up around smooth-muscle cells, causing fatty streaks Fibrofatty plaques form from repeated injury to the endothelial cells; as the process is repeated, the vessel progressively narrows Plaques can rupture, causing emboli, or can worsen and compromise myocardial oxygenation and blood fl ow, thus precipitating angina or MI /H18546Signs and symptoms Anginal pain is a classic symptom of CAD (see Angina, page 110) Others include the secondary effects of CAD, such as MI, heart failure, sudden cardiac death, cardio- megaly, valvular insuf ciencies, cardiogenic shock, and stroke /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnostic tests may include ECG, exercise ECG (stress test), cardiac catheterization, coronary angi- ography, intravascular ultrasound, myocardial perfusion imaging, LD1), troponin, myoglobin, cholesterol, lipopro- teins, and triglycerides also may be performed Treatment aims to modify risk factors for CAD to prevent acute myocardial events (for example, smoking cessation, decreased intake of dietary fat, and increased activity level); treatment may also include medication for anginal pain as well as beta-adrenergic blockers, calcium channel blockers, anti-platelet, antilipemic, antihypertensive drugs, Surgical rotational atherectomy or stent placement, artery bypass grafting (CABG), may be required to pre-vent progression to MI (see Nursing care of the cardiac surgical patient requiring CABG, page 111) /H18546Nursing interventions Increase the patient's knowledge of the relationship between risk factors and the development of CAD Teach the patient and family how to modify risk factors Encourage the patient to establish healthful habits, such as regular exercise and a low-fat diet Encourage participation in a smoking cessation program Emphasize the importance of prevention in treating heart disease Administer medication for anginal pain as ordered Med-Surg_Chap07.indd 109 Med-Surg_Chap07.indd 109 8/3/2011 8:16:48 PM 8/3/2011 of angina exist: stable (angina that hasn't increased in severity or frequency over several months), unstable (angina that has increased in frequency, severity, or duration or has changed in quality and occurs with minimal exertion and rest), Prinzmetal's or variant (angina that occurs at rest, long after exercise, or during sleep), and microvascu-lar (angina-like chest pain due to impairment of vasodilator reserve in patients with normal coronary arteries) Angina may result from atherosclerosis of coronary arter- ies, vasospasm, or hypotension that decreases blood fl ow through these arteries Signs and symptoms The major symptom is substernal or anterior chest pain that may radiate to the arms, neck, jaw, and shoulders; it may be described as mild-to-moderate pressure, tight-ness, squeezing, burning, smothering, indigestion, chok-ing, or mild soreness; the patient may exhibit Levine's sign (clenched st over sternum) Atypical chest pain, such as arm or shoulder pain; jaw, neck, or throat pain; toothache; back pain; or pain under the breastbone or in the stomach is likely to be seen in women Related signs and symptoms include shortness of breath, diaphoresis, nausea, increased heart rate, pallor, weak or numb feelings in the arms and hands, and unexplained anxiety Diagnosis and treatment Diagnostic tests may include electrocardiogram (ECG) (a patient with stable or unstable angina may have ST-segment depression; a patient with Prinzmetal's angina, ST-segment elevation), exercise ECG (stress test), cardiac catheterization, radioisotope imaging, and echocardiogram Laboratory tests may include levels protein, and homocysteine Treatment aims to decrease myocardial oxygen demand and increase myocardial oxygen supply Precipitating factors\u2014such as exercise, overexertion, emotional upset, cold weather, and large meals\u2014are identi- ed and avoided if possible Exercise programs are prescribed to build collateral circu- lation and increase myocardial ef ciency A nitrate isosorbide dinitrate; or isosorbide mononitrate), a beta-adrenergic blocker, a calcium channel blocker, or an antiplatelet drug (e.g., aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), or ticlopidine [Ticlid]) also may be prescribed to relieve symptoms A calcium channel blocker may be useful for a patient with Prinzmetal's or variant angina (see Nursing implications in clinical pharmacology, page 364) Angioplasty, stent placement, laser therapy, or ather- ectomy may be necessary to treat stable but debilitating anginal pain Nursing interventions Tell the patient to call an ambulance and seek medical attention immediately if the angina persists or changes in quality or severity or if other symptoms develop Inform the patient and family that angina is more easily evoked in cold weather and in times of emotional upset or extreme stress; these conditions should be avoided if possible Discuss structured exercise regimens, and encourage family support Instruct the patient to plan rest periods between activi- ties to prevent fatigue Tell the patient to take medications exactly as prescribed and not to change the medications without rst consulting the practitioner Educate the patient about nitroglycerin Teach the patient how to take nitroglycerin before cer- tain activities to prevent angina and how to take it for acute anginal episodes (e.g., to sit down when taking the tablet; to take one tablet at 5-minute intervals but not to exceed three tablets; and to be aware that a burning sensation will be felt under the tongue) Tell the patient to dispose of nitroglycerin that has been open for more than 6 months and to keep the tablets in a container protected from heat, light, and moisture Tell the patient and family to carry antianginal medica- tions and nitroglycerin when traveling, even on short trips Emphasize to the family the importance of learning car- diopulmonary resuscitation and basic life support Prepare the patient and family for surgery (if indicated), and offer psychological and emotional support Reinforce the importance of lifestyle modi cations, such as diet, exercise, stress reduction, and smoking 110 Med-Surg_Chap07.indd 111 The medical-surgical nurse is an integral part of the multidisciplinary team caring for the patient undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The nurse's astute assessments and prompt interventions can affect the patient's experience of and recovery from CABG. Preoperative care Intraoperative procedure Postoperative care Obtain an accurate and complete medical history. The degree of cardiac impairment is demonstrated by the patient's lifestyle limitations. Assess the patient's physiologic status before surgery. Baseline vital signs, integrity of pulses and extremities, neurologic status, respiratory status, height, weight, nutritional status, elimination patterns, and psychological status should be assessed and recorded. Teach the patient and family about the surgery and the immediate postoperative period in the intensive care unit. Prepare them for postoperative equipment that will be used, such as pulmonary artery lines, chest tubes, I.V. lines, indwelling urinary catheters, and equipment for mechanical ventilation and cardiac monitoring. Discuss speci c issues with the patient and family. For example, the patient should always report pain. (Reassure a patient who will be intubated and unable to speak that pain will be detected by facial The patient is placed on a cardiopulmonary bypass machine, which drains blood from the left ventricle and atrium and passes it through a pulsatile or roller pump to the femoral artery or descending aorta. Pulmonary circulation isn't interrupted. Myocardial tissue is preserved during surgery by arresting the heart with a cardioplegic solution, which usually is cold (39.4\u00b0 F [4.1\u00b0 C]). External cooling also may be achieved with a slush saline solution administered into the pericardium. After the patient is cooled suf ciently, bypass grafts, which are usually harvested from saphenous veins in the legs, are placed surgically from the aorta to sites distal to the occlusions on coronary arteries. Achieve and maintain body temperature. Monitor cardiovascular function with serial blood pressure, hemodynamic monitoring (cardiac output, central venous pressure, pulmonary artery wedge pressure, systemic vascular resistance), and electrocardiogram evaluations, and maintain it with various medications. Monitor drainage from chest tubes in the mediastinal area, and assess peripheral pulses. Turn the patient every 2 hours to promote drainage. A sudden change in drainage color to bright red, hemorrhaging that lasts more than 1 minute, or cessation of drainage are abnormal; report them to the practitioner immediately. Monitor respiratory status. Maintain an open airway at all times. Promote aggressive pulmonary hygiene. Inform the practitioner if the patient doesn't awaken 1 to 3 hours after surgery. Report any neurologic change from the baseline value.

Bloody drainage in the chest tube is normal, as is feeling the need to void while the urinary catheter is in place. The tubes and lines may restrict patient movement, but the nurse should help the patient to pre-vent injury. Ask the patient if he has an advanced directive in place.The internal mammary artery may also be rerouted to bypass an occlusion. After the procedure is completed, the blood in the bypass machine is slowly warmed, and the patient's body temperature is returned to nor-mal. While the incisions are closed, epicardial pacing wires are placed and grounded, and chest tubes are inserted. Maintain adequate renal circulation. Postoperative renal insuf ciency is caused by complications of extracorporeal circulation during surgery and can lead to the need for hemodialysis if permanent damage occurs. Document daily weight and fl uid intake and output. Monitor serum elec-trolytes frequently. Make the patient as comfortable as possible; for example, by administering an opioid analgesic or positioning for comfort. Organize activities so that the patient can rest frequently. A structured program of early, progressive ambulation and activity can be helpful, but must allow for individual differences. Provide a program of cardiac risk modi cation. Encourage participation in a cardiac rehabilitation program.Nursing care of the cardiac surgical patient requiring CABG (continued) 112 Med-Surg_Chap07.indd 112 8/3/2011 PMHeart failure 113 Heart failure /H18546Description Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can no longer pump enough blood to meet the body's demands Left-sided heart failure may be caused by anterior ventricular septal defect, cardiomyopathy, car- heart failure may be caused by left-sided heart failure, a right ventricular MI, atrial septal defect, fl uid overload pulmonary embolism, pulmonary outfl ow stenosis, chronic obstructive disease, pulmonary hypertension (cor pulmonale), or thyro-toxicosis With left-sided heart failure, the diseased left ventricle can't pump effectively because of decreased cardiac output, decreased contractility, increased volume, and increased left ventricular pressure The left atrium can't empty into the left ventricle, causing increased pressure in the left atrium; this pressure increase affects the lungs, causing pulmonary congestion that leads to decreased oxygenation Increased pressure in the lungs causes increased right-sided heart pressure; the right ventricle can't relieve the pressure by emptying into the lungs, which impairs venous return to the right side of the heart As systemic pressure builds, body organs become congested with venous blood Heart failure may also be classi ed as systolic or diastolic dysfunction With systolic dysfunction, poor ventricular contraction results in inadequate emptying of the ventricle With diastolic dysfunction, reduced ventricular compliance results in increased resistance to ventricular lling High-output failure may occur in high-output states, pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, beri- beri, and arteriovenous stula High-output failure results in high cardiac output and leads to ventricular dysfunction Despite increased cardiac output, the heart is unable to meet the body's increased metabolic needs /H18546Signs and symptoms Both right- and left-sided heart failure may cause chest discomfort, shortness of breath, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, bloating, edema in the extremities, jugular venous distention, and decreased urine output Left-sided heart failure also may produce anxiety, orthopnea, dyspnea on exertion and respiratory acidosis, hypoxia, increased pulmonary artery pressures (determined with a pulmonary artery catheter), mental confusion, abnormal heart sounds (S 3 and S4), fatigue, lethargy, anorexia, nausea, splenomegaly, arrhythmias, increased right- and left-sided heart pressures (determined with a pulmonary artery catheter), Kussmaul's respirations, abnormal heart sounds (S 3 and S4), fatigue, lethargy, abdominal pain, and weight gain /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnostic tests may include ECG, chest X-ray, echocardiography, pulmonary artery catheter insertion, and arterial blood gas studies Laboratory tests may include a CBC; liver function tests; serum function tests performed); and B-type natriuretic peptide The goals of treatment are to decrease cardiac workload, increase cardiac output and contractility, decrease fl uid and sodium retention, and decrease venous congestion Activity is restricted to decrease cardiac workload Oxygen may be administered to counteract desaturation Med-Surg_Chap07.indd 113 Med-Surg_Chap07.indd 113 8/3/2011 8:16:48 PM 8/3/2011 Cardiovascular disorders Drug therapy includes an ACE inhibitor (the cornerstone of therapy) to decrease afterload; a diuretic to decrease preload and afterload; digoxin to contractility and cardiac ef ciency and decrease heart rate; and a beta-adrenergic blocker to reduce heart rate and myocardial oxygen consumption Diuretics and vasodilators should be avoided in patients with diastolic dysfunction because they may not be able to tolerate reduced blood pressure or reduced volume Other drugs that may be useful in treating heart failure include vasodilators (such as hydralazine) combined with a nitrate (such as isosorbide), angiotensin II receptor blockers in patients who can't tolerate ACE inhibitors, or nesiritide (a human B-type natriuretic peptide) to augment diuresis and decrease afterload Patients with acute pulmonary edema may also be treated with nitroglycerin I.V., morphine sulfate, oxygen, and mechanical ventilation If the patient has high-output failure, correct the underlying cause /H18546Nursing interventions Monitor the patient for common signs and symptoms of heart failure, such as chest discomfort, short- ness of breath, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea Also watch for signs and symptoms of left-sided heart failure, such as anxiety, orthopnea, and abnormal breath sounds Monitor for signs and symptoms of right-sided heart failure, such as jugular venous peripheral pulses Encourage bed rest in semi-Fowler's position for ease of breathing Provide rest intervals between periods of activity Restrict fl uids as prescribed Administer medications as prescribed, and monitor for their therapeutic and adverse effects (see Nursing implications in clinical pharmacology , page 364) Monitor fl uid intake and output Administer oxygen as prescribed Monitor vital signs carefully, especially when administering vasoactive drugs Check the patient's weight daily Frequently assess for cardiac and respiratory signs of heart failure Note changes that suggest worsening of heart failure or fl uid imbalance Explain procedures and provide reassurance to decrease patient and family anxiety Teach the patient and family about medications and the importance of careful management of fl uids, sodium intake, and weight Hypertension /H18546Description Hypertension is persistent high blood pressure, usually de ned as a systolic pressure above 140 mm Hg or a diastolic pressure above 90 mm Hg based on two or more consecutive readings over a 2-week period (see Classifying blood pressure readings ) Three types of hypertension exist: essential or idiopathic (elevated blood pressure of unknown cause); secondary (elevated blood pressure of known cause, such as renovascular disease, pregnancy, and coarctation of the aorta); and malignant (severe, fulminant form with a diastolic pressure above 140 mm Hg) Hypertension may result from renovascular disease, toxemia of pregnancy, a genetic predisposition, smoking, diabetes, stress, seden-tary lifestyle, and obesity increase the risk of developing hypertension /H18546Signs and symptoms The cardinal sign is consistently elevated blood pressure although there may be no other symptoms or physical ndings Med-Surg_Chap07.indd 114 Med-Surg_Chap07.indd 114 8/3/2011 8:16:48 PM 8/3/2011 8:16:48 PMHypertension 115 Related signs and symptoms may include headache (usually in the morning), dizziness, bruits, fl ushed face, and dyspnea (if the lungs are involved) /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnostic tests depend on the suspected cause or effects of hypertension For example, kidney function tests, such as urinalysis and creatinine and BUN levels, may be per- formed because renal damage can cause hypertension ECG, chest X-ray, and echocardiography may be done to determine if hypertension has affected cardiac function Ophthalmic examination may refl ect retinal damage Diet, exercise, and lifestyle modi cations (such as smoking cessation, reducing alcohol intake, stress management, and weight reduction) are recommended rst If nonpharmacologic measures fail to maintain blood pressure within normal limits, antihyperten- sives, such as diuretics, ACE inhibitors, blockers, are prescribed /H18546Nursing interventions Monitor the patient's blood pressure regularly, and assess for other signs and symptoms of hyperten- sion, such as headache and retinal hemorrhages Provide a calm, quiet environment Teach the patient and family about weight control, stress reduction, and smoking cessation Discuss the importance of a low-sodium diet; include the dietitian in teaching low-sodium recipes and recipe modi cation for the patient and the person who does the cooking Teach the patient how to take his blood pressureIn 2003, the National Institutes of Health issued the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detec- tion, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. Categories now are normal, prehypertension, and stages 1 and 2 hypertension. The revised categories are based on the average of two or more readings taken on separate visits after an initial screen- ing. They apply to adults age 18 and older. (If the systolic and diastolic pressures fall into different categories, use the hi gher of the two readings to classify the readings.) Patients with prehypertension are at increased risk of developing hypertension and should follow health-promoting life- style modi cations to prevent cardiovascular disease.

it may be acute or chronic The underlying cause is most often an infectious organism that triggers an autoimmune, cellular, and humoral reaction; the heart muscle weakens and contractility decreases; the conduction system can also be affected The disorder can result in heart dilation, heart failure, thrombi on the heart wall (mural thrombi), in ltration of circulating blood cells around coronary vessels and between muscle bers, and degenera- tion of the muscle bers themselves Most patients with mild signs and symptoms recover completely, but some develop cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and arrhythmias /H18546Signs and symptoms The signs and symptoms of acute myocarditis depend on the type of infection, the degree of myocar- dial damage, and the capacity of the myocardium to recover Patients may be asymptomatic, with an infection that resolves on its own Initially, fl ulike signs and symptoms typically occur Mild to moderate symptoms include fatigue, dyspnea, palpitations, and occasional discomfort in the chest and upper abdomen Severe congestive heart failure can quickly develop, and sudden cardiac death can occur /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Laboratory tests include cardiac enzyme and I levels are also elevated WBC count, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are all elevated Antibody titers such as antistreptolysin-O titer in rheumatic fever are elevated Stool cultures, throat or pharyngeal washings, and other body fl uid cultures show the causative bacteria or virus Diagnostic tests include two-dimensional echocardiography, which may reveal impaired systolic or diastolic ventricular function or both A chest X-ray may show cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema, and possible pleural effusions Cardiac angiography helps rule out cardiac ischemia as a cause MRI reveals the extent of infl ammation and cellular edema Biopsy of the endomyocardium can con rm the diagnosis Although electrocardiography can produce highly variable results, it may show sinus tachycardia; diffuse ST-segments; T-wave abnormalities, ventricular and supraventricular ectopic arrhythmias /H18546Nursing interventions Assess the patient for resolution of tachycardia, fever, and any other clinical manifestations Focus your cardiovascular assessment on signs and symptoms of heart failure and arrhythmias For a patient with arrhythmias, provide continuous cardiac monitoring, with personnel and equip- ment readily available to treat life-threatening arrhythmias Provide ventricular assistance if 8:16:48 PM 8/3/2011 8:16:48 PMPericarditis 117 Keep in mind that patients with myocarditis are sensitive to digitalis;

the chronic form is characterized by dense, brous pericardial thickening that constricts the heart Pericarditis may be idiopathic, or it may result from infection that causes infl ammation, connective tissue disorders, immune reactions, MI, pneumonia, pleural disease, cancer, trauma, or renal failure Complications include pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade, and heart failure /H18546Signs and symptoms Pericarditis may be asymptomatic; when symptoms do occur, the most common is a sharp, piercing, sudden chest pain that typically starts over the sternum and radiates to the neck, shoulders, back, and arms Other symptoms include pleuritic pain that increases with deep inspiration and decreases when the patient sits up and leans forward, dyspnea, dry cough, low-grade fever, pericardial friction rub, hypo-tension, and tachycardia /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnostic tests may include echocardiography, which shows the extent of pericardial effusion; CT scanning; and ECG, which may show ST-segment elevation in multiple leads Laboratory tests may include WBC count, sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein, which are all elevated Identifying and treating the underlying cause guides therapy Drug therapy may include analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-infl ammatory drugs, such as aspirin or ibuprofen (Motrin), for pain relief during the acute phase Pericardiocentesis removes some of the pericardial fl uid, reduces pressure, and can be cultured to reveal the causative infectious agent Surgical removal of the tough encasing pericardium (pericardiectomy) may be necessary to release both ventricles from the constrictive and restrictive infl ammation and scarring /H18546Nursing interventions Administer pain medications as needed as well as steroids and other anti-infl ammatory agents; give with food to minimize the risk of GI complications Administer an antibiotic or antifungal agent based on the underlying causative organism Prepare the patient for pericardiocentesis if signs and symptoms of cardiac tamponade develop, which may begin with shortness of breath, chest tightness, or dizziness; developing signs include pro-gressive restlessness and a drop of 10 mm Hg or more in the systolic blood pressure during inspiration (pulsus paradoxus) Prepare the patient for pericardectomy or pericardotomy (pericardial window) Provide appropriate postoperative care Supply oxygen therapy as needed Monitor the patient's hemodynamics Place the patient upright to relieve dyspnea and chest pain; allow for frequent rest periods, and cluster activities to reduce energy expenditure and oxygen demand Encourage the patient to express concerns about the effects of activity restrictions on his normal routines and responsibilities Med-Surg_Chap07.indd 117 Med-Surg_Chap07.indd 117 8/3/2011 Raynaud's disease is characterized by episodic vasospasm in the small peripheral arteries and arteri- oles, precipitated by exposure to cold or stress This disease is most prevalent in women and usually develops between puberty and age 40 Raynaud's disease may be primary or secondary; primary disease is idiopathic, and symptoms occur without an underlying disease or associated condition Secondary Raynaud's disease is a condition commonly associated with connective tissue disorders\u2014 such as scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, and polymyositis\u2014and has a progressive course, leading to ischemia, gangrene, and amputation /H18546Signs and symptoms After exposure to cold or stress, the skin of the ngers typically blanches, then becomes cyanotic before changing to red; numbness and tingling may also occur In long-standing disease, trophic changes, such as sclerodactyly, ulcerations, or chronic paronychia may result (ulceration and gangrene are rare) /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnostic tests may include Doppler studies, arteriography, plethysmography, and antinuclear anti- body titer Drug treatment includes as phenoxybenzamine, calcium channel blockers, and adrenergic blockers; pentoxifylline may also be effective Sympathectomy may be performed if conservative measures fail to prevent ischemic ulcers /H18546Nursing interventions Teach the patient to avoid exposure to the cold Advise the patient to avoid stressful situations and to stop smoking; teach the patient biofeedback and relaxation exercises Teach the patient to inspect the skin and to seek immediate treatment for signs of skin breakdown or infection Thrombophlebitis /H18546Description Thrombophlebitis is marked by infl ammation of the venous wall and thrombus formation of the deep or super cial veins Deep vein thrombophlebitis may lead to occlusion of the vessels or systemic embolization such as pulmonary embolism Several conditions may lead to thrombophlebitis, including hypercoagulability (such as from cancer, blood dyscrasias, or oral contraceptives); injury to the venous wall (such as from I.V. injections, frac-tures, antibiotics, or infection); and venous stasis (such as from varicose veins, pregnancy, heart failure, or prolonged bed rest) /H18546Signs and symptoms Deep vein thrombophlebitis will sometimes cause no clinical symptoms or physicial ndings; when they do occur, they may include cramping pain, edema, positive Homans' sign, tenderness to touch, fever, chills, and malaise Super cial thrombophlebitis produces visible and palpable signs, such as heat, pain, swelling, rubor, tenderness, and induration along the affected vein's length /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnostic tests may include photoplethysmography, Doppler ultrasonography, and venography;

While auscultating the heart sounds of a patient with mitral insuf ciency, the nurse hears an extra heart sound immediately after the second heart sound (S2). The nurse should document this extra heart sound as: /H18540A. a rst heart sound (S1). /H18540B. a third heart sound (S3). /H18540C. a fourth heart sound (S4). /H18540D. a mitral murmur. Correct answer: B An S3 is heard following an S2, indicating that the patient is experiencing heart failure and results from increased lling pressures. Option A (S1) is a normal heart sound made by the closing of the mitral and tricuspid valves. Option C (S4) is heard before S1 and is caused by resistance to ventricular lling. Option D (murmur of mitral insuf ciency) occurs during systole and is heard when there's turbu- lent blood fl ow across the valve. 2. A 55-year-old black male is found to have a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg during a work site health screening. What should the nurse do? /H18540A. Consider this to be a normal nding for his age and race. /H18540B. Recommend he have his blood pressure rechecked in 1 year. /H18540C. Recommend he have his blood pressure rechecked within 2 weeks. /H18540D. Recommend he go to the emergency department for further evaluation. Correct answer: C A blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg should be rechecked within 2 weeks according to current recommendations. If con rmed, assessment and treatment should be initiated by the practitioner. Option A is incorrect because although hypertension is more prevalent among blacks, a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg isn't considered normal. Option B is incorrect because a person with a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg shouldn't wait as long as 1 year to have it rechecked. Option D is incorrect because he doesn't need to be treated on an emergency basis, but he should have his blood pressure monitored. 3. The nurse is administering warfarin (Coumadin) to a patient with deep vein thrombophlebitis. Which labo- ratory value indicates warfarin is at therapeutic /H18540A. 1\u00bd to 2 times the control /H18540B. PT 1\u00bd to 2 times the control /H18540C. INR of 3 to 4 /H18540D. Hematocrit of 32% Correct answer: B Warfarin is at therapeutic levels when the patient's PT is 1\u00bd to 2 times the control. Higher values indicate increased risk of bleeding and hemorrhage, and lower values indicate increased risk of blood clot formation. Option A is incorrect because heparin, not warfarin, prolongs PTT. Option C is incorrect because although the INR may also be used to determine if warfarin is at a therapeutic level, an INR of 2 to 3 is considered therapeutic. Option D is incorrect because hematocrit doesn't provide information on the effectiveness of warfarin; however, a falling hematocrit in a patient taking warfarin may be a sign of hemorrhage. 8/3/2011 8:16:48 PM 8/3/2011 questions 123 4. A patient is receiving captopril for heart failure. The nurse should notify the practitioner that the medication therapy is ineffective if an assessment reveals: /H18540A. a skin rash. /H18540B. peripheral /H18540D. postural hypotension. answer: B Peripheral edema is a sign of fl uid volume overload and worsening heart failure. The other options (a skin rash, dry cough, and postural hypotension) are adverse reactions to captopril, but they don't indicate that therapy isn't effective. 5. A 60-year-old male patient is suspected of having coronary artery disease. Which noninvasive diagnostic method would the nurse expect to be ordered to evaluate cardiac changes? /H18540A. Cardiac biopsy /H18540B. Cardiac catheterization /H18540C. Correct answer: C MRI is a noninvasive procedure that aids in the diagnosis and detection of thoracic aortic aneurysm and evaluation of coronary artery disease, pericardial disease, and cardiac masses. Car-diac biopsy (Option A), cardiac catheterization (Option B), and pericardiocentesis (Option D) are invasive techniques used to evaluate cardiac changes. 6. When evaluating an ECG strip of a patient on a telemetry unit, the nurse notices the patient is having pre- mature ventricular contractions (PVCs). What criterion on the ECG strip does the nurse use to evaluate the pres-ence of PVCs? /H18540A. An indiscernible PR interval /H18540B. P waves that appear erratic /H18540C. P waves that have a sawtooth con guration /H18540D. A QRS complex followed by a compensatory pause Correct answer: D In PVCs, the ECG shows a QRS complex followed by a compensatory pause that ends when the underlying rhythm resumes. Options A and B are ECG criteria used to evaluate atrial brillation. Option C is used to describe criteria for atrial fl utter. 7. When locating Erb's point to hear aortic and pulmonic sounds, the nurse should place the stethoscope at the: /H18540A. fth intercostal space near the midclavicular line. /H18540B. fth intercostal space along the left sternal border. /H18540C. second intercostal space at the left sternal border. /H18540D. third intercostal space at the left sternal border. Correct answer: D Erb's point is located at the third intercostal space at the left sternal border. The fth intercostal space near the midclavicular line (Option A) is used to listen to the mitral area. The fth intercostal space along the left sternal border (Option B) is the location for the tricuspid area. The second intercostal space at the left sternal border (Option C) is the location for the pulmonic area.

When caring for a patient with arterial occlusive disease, which of the following home health care instructions is most appropriate for the nurse to give to the patient? /H18540A. \"You should massage your legs to relieve pain.\" /H18540B. \"It's best to sit and rest for several hours a day.\" /H18540C. \"Make sure the head of your bed is slightly elevated when sleeping.\" /H18540D. \"It's best to wear tight socks instead of no socks.\" Correct answer: C The patient should make sure the head of the bed is slightly elevated to aid perfu- sion to the lower extremities. The patient shouldn't massage his legs (Option A) because doing so could further damage tissue. Sitting for several hours a day (Option B) isn't recommended. The patient should wear loose clothing, not constrictive clothing such as socks with tight elastic (Option D), to avoid com-pressing the vessels in the legs. 9. The nurse prepares to administer an ACE inhibitor to a patient with an acute MI for which reason? /H18540A. To minimize platelet aggregation myocardial oxygen consumption /H18540D. To decrease myocardial oxygen demand Correct answer: B ACE inhibitors reduce preload and afterload. Antiplatelet drugs minimize platelet aggregation (Option reduce myocardial oxygen consumption (Option C). Beta-adrenergic blockers reduce the workload of the heart and myocardial oxygen demand (Option D). 10. Which of the following conditions can cause right-sided heart failure? /H18540A. A ventricular defect can lead to right-sided heart failure. Left-sided heart failure can result from a ventricular septal defect (Option A), an anterior MI (Option B), or constrictive pericardi-tis (Option D).

Note the patient's skin color; look for bruising, diaphoresis, dyspnea, lesions, petechiae, and swelling of the lymph nodes Note the size and color of his tongue Ask the patient whether his abdominal girth is enlarged The nurse uses auscultation Listen to heart sounds, noting abnormal sounds, rhythms, or tachycardia Auscultate the abdomen, noting bowel sounds, bruits, friction rubs, or venous hums8Hematologic disordersHematologic the nurse uses palpation Palpate the lymph nodes, noting consistency, mobility, shape, size, and tenderness; compare nodes on one side of the body with those on the other side Palpate the abdomen, noting ascites, enlarged organs, or tenderness The nurse then uses percussion Percuss the liver and spleen to estimate size Note the size and location of other abdominal organs Anemias /H18546Anemia exists when the number of RBCs in a designated volume of blood is less than normal /H18546Anemias include those from blood loss or hemolysis and aplastic, iron de ciency, and megaloblastic anemias (see Types of anemia, pages 127 to 128) Disseminated intravascular coagulation /H18546Description Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a serious blood coagulation disorder that occurs as a complication of conditions that accelerate blood clotting. It's characterized by suppression of the brinolytic system and the development of small clots in the microcirculation, which consumes clotting factors, resulting in excessive bleeding The disorder can result from septicemia; obstetric complications, such as abruptio cirrhosis Tissue hypoxia and multiple organ failure can occur; the mortality rate can exceed 80% /H18546Signs and symptoms The main sign is abnormal bleeding, evidenced by cutaneous oozing, petechiae, ecchymoses, hematomas, GI bleeding, and bleeding from wounds and I.V. sites Signs of organ compromise include dyspnea, oliguria, and muscle or abdominal pain; shock can also occur /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Laboratory tests show a steadily decreasing platelet count, elevated prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), elevated brin degradation products, and decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit Medical management aims to identify and treat the underlying disorder, promote oxygenation, replace fl uids and electrolytes, and provide hemodynamic support Treatments include clotting factor and blood replacement and I.V. heparin /H18546Nursing interventions Early recognition of the onset of DIC improves patient outcomes, so closely monitor patients at risk, watching for signs and symptoms For a patient with DIC, avoid trauma to skin or wounds to minimize bleeding, protect the patient from injury, and avoid dislodging clots Apply pressure to puncture sites until bleeding stops Monitor the patient's vital signs, and administer I.V. fl uids and blood products as ordered Monitor the patient's intake and output carefully and record blood loss Watch for signs of tissue ischemia and failure Provide emotional support to the patient and family Hemophilia /H18546Description Hemophilia is a hereditary bleeding disorder that results from the lack of speci c clotting factors Two main forms exist: Hemophilia A, called \"classic hemophilia,\" results from de ciency of factor VIII and is seen in 80% of cases, and hemophilia B, called \"Christmas disease,\" results from de ciency of factor IX and is seen in 15% of cases; the two types are clinically indistinguishable Med-Surg_Chap08.indd 126 8/3/2011 8:50:46 PM 8/3/2011 8:50:46 Types of anemia This chart summarizes the etiology, signs and symptoms, medical management, and nursing interventions for each type of anemia, which is de ned as a decreased number of red blood cells (RBCs). Description and etiologySigns and symptomsMedical managementNursing interventions Anemia from blood loss Anemia resulting from the loss of more than 500 mL of blood Acute blood loss, as in trauma or surgery Chronic blood loss, as in menstrual or GI bleeding RBC indices below normal on serum blood tests With acute blood loss: sudden onset of symptoms, such as hypovolemia, hypotension, hypoxemia, irritability, stupor, weakness, tachycardia, and cool, moist skin With chronic blood loss: gradual and vague symptoms, such as exertional dyspnea, increased fatigue, and pallor The source of the bleeding is identi ed and controlled through medical or surgical means. Transfusion and iron supplementation may be needed. Whole blood is transfused if the total blood volume has dropped; packed RBCs are transfused if it hasn't dropped. Shock must be treated if it occurs. Help determine the cause of bleeding by testing stool, urine, vomitus, or sputum for blood. Help control blood loss by applying pressure to obvious bleeding sites, assessing the patient for internal bleeding, and performing dressing changes as needed to assess blood loss. Aplastic anemia Anemia characterized by a decreased hemoglobin level and pancytopenia Unknown etiology or an autoimmune disturbance (50% of cases) Drug therapy with a chemotherapeutic drug, chloramphenicol, mephenytoin, phenylbutazone, or a sulfonamide Exposure to environmental or occupational hazards, such as benzene, insecticides, or radiation Infection, such as cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis, or miliary tuberculosis Congenital causes Exertional fatigue, infections, pallor, and palpitations Hemorrhage\u2014for example, bleeding (nasal, oral, rectal, or vaginal), ecchymosis, petechiae, or purpura Low platelet, RBC, and white blood cell counts Dry bone marrow (on aspiration) Initial treatment involves removing the causative agent, if possible, and administering transfusions. Medications such as antithymocyte globulin (ATG), cyclosporine, granulocyte colony-stimulating factors, and granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor may be administered. Treat the idiopathic form of the disease with steroids. If the anemia can't be reversed or if it results from an autoimmune disturbance, bone marrow transplantation is recommended; this treatment is more effective if the patient doesn't receive blood products rst and is younger than age 30. Help identify the causative agent. Assist a weak patient with daily activities. If the patient has pancytopenia, take safety precautions and steps to control infection because his ability to ght infection and sustain clotting are decreased. Help the patient and family cope with the severity of the illness and its prognosis. (Death may result from infection or hemorrhage.) If the patient is receiving ATG, perform skin testing, and monitor him for allergic reaction. Congenital hemolytic anemia: Sickle cell anemia Anemia characterized by RBC destruction beyond the bone marrow's ability to produce these cells and misshapen hemoglobin and RBCs Inherited (primarily affects blacks) Painful vaso-occlusive events in the extremities or affected organs (sickle cell crisis) Other symptoms similar to other chronic anemias No cure or prevention is available. Supportive interventions are used to prevent infection, relieve pain, and provide fl uid and oxygen during a sickle cell crisis, which can cause massive organ damage. If the patient has sickle cell anemia, provide genetic counseling and possible gene replacement therapy. Teach the patient to avoid factors that may precipitate sickle cell crisis, such as cold exposure, dehydration, excessive exercise, high altitudes, and smoking. (continued ) Congenital hemolytic anemia: Thalassemia Anemia characterized by RBC destruction beyond the bone marrow's ability to produce these cells and mutated hemoglobin Inherited (primarily affects Blacks, Asians, and people of Mediterranean origin) Cardiac problems, such as cardiomegaly, heart failure, and murmurs Excessive hematopoiesis and iron overload Other symptoms similar to other chronic anemias Transfusions are the primary treatment. Chelating agents are used to remove excess iron from the blood after multiple transfusions have been administered. Splenectomy may be required for severe thalassemia. Bone marrow transplant also is an option. If the patient has thalassemia, provide genetic counseling. Iron-de ciency anemia Anemia caused by inadequate iron supplies Chronic blood loss without iron replacement Poor nutrition Decreased iron absorption from the intestines Increased need for iron, such as during childhood or pregnancy Possibly asymptomatic Possible sense of being cold due to iron's role in regulating body temperature Brittle, spoon-shaped nails with longitudinal ridges; cheilosis (painful mouth cracks or sores); exertional dyspnea; insidious development of fatigue; and red, shiny tongue Hypochromic, microcytic anemia (on blood smears); low serum iron level; and elevated serum iron-binding capacities The cause of blood loss or nutritional de cits is identi ed and corrected. An oral iron supplement may be prescribed. If the patient is unable to tolerate it, a parenteral iron formulation may be administered I.M. via the Z-track method or I.V. Help determine the cause of bleeding by testing stool, urine, vomitus, and sputum for blood. Teach the patient how to take oral iron. Advise the patient to take iron pills with meals to reduce GI irritation and to continue therapy until the underlying problem is corrected. Teach the patient about adverse reactions to oral iron therapy, such as black stools, constipation or diarrhea, and GI disturbances. Educate the patient about nutrition, including the need for iron-rich foods and adequate vitamin C to enhance iron absorption. Megaloblastic anemia Anemia characterized by a predominance of megaloblasts and a relative lack of normoblasts; includes pernicious, vitamin B 12 de ciency, and folic acid de ciency anemias Gastric surgery, particularly of the terminal ileum where vitamin B 12 is absorbed; strict vegetarian diets; and prolonged exposure to nitrous oxide Aging and long-term gastritis (pernicious anemia) Alcoholic malnutrition and malabsorption (folic acid de ciency anemia) Epithelial atrophy, loss of coordination, neuropathy, and paresthesia of the extremities Gastritis, glossitis (red, beefy tongue), and malabsorption with anorexia and weight loss Decreased RBC and platelet counts Monthly administration of parenteral vitamin B12 typically is required for pernicious and vitamin B 12 de ciency anemias. An oral folic acid supplement and dietary improvement typically are required for a patient with folic acid de ciency, which commonly results from nutritional de cits. Provide care for oral mucous membranes to help relieve glossitis. Teach the patient how to increase dietary intake of folic acid and vitamin B 12. Refer the patient with anemia related to alcohol abuse to an alcohol rehabilitation clinic. If the patient has a vitamin B12 de ciency, teach him about long-term treatment with an oral or parenteral vitamin B 12 supplement. Treatment typically calls for monthly I.M. administration of cyanocobalamin.Types of anemia (continued B are X-linked recessive traits; female carriers have a 50% chance of transmitting the gene to each child; sons who receive the gene have the disease, whereas daughters who receive the gene are carriers; patients with the disease are usually identi ed in childhood Hemophilia produces bleeding, with the degree of bleeding varying depending on the degree of clotting factor de ciency Mild hemophilia usually causes bleeding only during major surgery or trauma Moderate hemophilia occasionally causes spontaneous bleeding in addition to bleeding during surgery and from trauma Severe hemophilia causes spontaneous bleeding; bleeding from minor trauma may be severe /H18546Signs and symptoms Signs of hemophilia include excessive bleeding from wound and puncture sites, hematomas, spontaneous bleeding (such as nosebleeds), and GI bleeding Joint pain results from bleeding into joints, a common occurrence A change in level of consciousness can signal intracranial bleeding /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Laboratory tests include abnormal clotting factor assays, which con rm diagnosis; prolonged PTT with normal PT and normal platelet count may also occur Treatment typically consists of replacement of de cient clotting factors (VIII or IX); however, patients can develop antibodies to factor concentrates, which reduces their effectiveness Aminocaproic acid inhibits brinolysis and can be used to stabilize clots Desmopressin (DDAVP) can be used to induce a transient rise in factor VIII /H18546Nursing interventions During bleeding episodes, administer the de cient clotting factors or plasma as ordered Prevent trauma, and limit activity when bleeding occurs Minimize injections and apply pressure for at least 10 minutes to puncture sites Monitor vital signs and be alert for hemodynamic changes Administer analgesics and cold packs for joint pain; promote joint mobility when bleeding is controlled Teach the patient and family about the disease process, monitoring, treatment, and genetic testing Hodgkin's disease /H18546Description Hodgkin's disease is a malignant B lymphocyte cell line disease of the lymph system that primarily affects those between ages 15 and 30 and those older than age 55 The malignant cell associated with Hodgkin's disease is the Reed-Sternberg cell, a giant, morphologically unique cell that's most likely of immature lymphoid origin Although the cause is unknown, this cancer is associated with viral infections and sustained immunosuppression; a genetic and environmental association may also exist It's among the most treatable of adult cancers and has a better prognosis than malignant, or non-Hodgkin's disease /H18546Signs and symptoms This cancer is characterized by greatly enlarged, painless, movable lymph nodes in the cervical or supraclavicular area The patient may also experience fever, malaise, night sweats, pruritus, and weight loss (referred to as \"B\" symptoms) Symptoms resulting from compression by the enlarged lymph nodes depend on the area involved /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Lymph node biopsy showing Reed-Sternberg cells supports the diagnosis Staging is done after the initial diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease is con rmed The stage of disease is determined by biopsies of distant lymph nodes, bilateral bone marrow biopsies, lymphangiography, computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 129 gallium scan, positron emission tomography (PET), chest X-ray, a complete blood count (CBC), and serum alkaline phosphatase A splenectomy is traditionally done during staging Hodgkin's disease has four stages (see Staging lymphomas ) Early stages of Hodgkin's disease are treated with external radiation of the affected lymph nodes More advanced stages require a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy Autologus bone marrow transplantation or autologus peripheral blood sternal transfusions and immunotherapy are used for disease resistant to standard treatment /H18546Nursing interventions Provide supportive care related to the adverse effects of radiation therapy and chemotherapy (see Nursing implications in oncology care , page 357) Provide psychological support to help the patient cope with the diagnosis, treatment, and effects of treatment Provide education to the patient and his family regarding the diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease and its treatment Leukemia /H18546Description Leukemia is a group of malignant disorders of the hematopoietic system that involves the bone mar- row and lymph nodes and is characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of immature WBCsStaging lymphomas Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are classi ed into stages so that treatment protocols can be established and outcomes predicted. The Ann Arbor classi cation system is used. Stages Stage I Involvement of a single lymph node region or Localized involvement of a single extranodal organ or site Stage II Involvement of two or more lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm or Localized involvement to a single associated extranodal organ or site and its regional lymph nodes with or without other lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm Stage III Involvement of lymph node regions on both sides of the diaphragm that may also be accompanied by localized involvement of an extranodal organ or site, by involvement of the spleen, or by bothLetter designation The stages are also accompanied by a letter designation that refers to patient symptoms as follows: A means absence of the speci c symptoms listed in B but may include other common symptoms such as pruritus. B includes the presence of at least one of the following three symptoms:- temperature greater than 100.4\u00b0 F (38\u00b0 C)- unexplained loss of more than 10% of body weight in the preceding 6 months- drenching night sweatsStage IV Disseminated involvement of one or more extralymphatic sites with or without associated lymph node involvement or Isolated extralymphatic organ involvement with distant (nonregional) nodal involvement Extralymphatic sites include the liver, lungs, bone marrow, pleurae, bone, and skin as well as tissues sepa-rate from but near to major lymphatic clusters. The spleen is considered a lymphatic site. Leukemias are classi ed by onset and severity of symptoms (acute or chronic) and by the precursor cell (myeloid or lymphoid) involved in the formation of the abnormal cells (see Types of leukemia ) Although the cause of leukemia is unknown, it has been linked to genetic damage to cells, which transforms normal cells into malignant cells; it's associated with Down's syndrome and other chromosomal abnormalities, chronic exposure to chemicals such as benzene, use of drugs that cause aplastic anemia, radiation exposure, and chemotherapy In leukemia, WBC (leukocyte) proliferation interferes with the production of other cells, leading to thrombocytopenia and anemia; the immature leukocytes decrease immunocompetence and increase susceptibility to infection /H18546Signs and symptoms A patient with either acute or chronic leukemia may report vague signs and symptoms, such as fatigue, malaise, petechiae, night sweats, bone or joint pain, and weight loss Acute leukemia produces anemia, bleeding, and symptoms of infection such as sudden onset of high fever; hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy may also be present Chronic leukemia causes milder anemia and splenomegaly; however, many patients are asymptom- atic at the time of diagnosis Additional signs and symptoms depend on the organ or tissue involved\u2014for example, central ner- vous system involvement may cause headache and vomiting /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis is usually based on bone marrow examination that reveals leukemic blast cells and on a CBC Chemotherapy, with or without stem cell transplantation, is standard treatment for leukemia (see Nursing implications in oncology care , page 357)The following chart compares the incidence and signs and symptoms for various types of leukemia. Leukemia Incidence Signs and symptoms Acute leukemias Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) Primarily affects children ages 2 to 4. Incidence declines dramatically after age 10. Survival rates are higher in children than adults, and the prognosis for ALL is better than that of acute myeloblastic leukemia. Anemia with fatigue and pallor Bleeding, such as ecchymosis, gingival or rectal bleeding, and petechiae Decreased hematocrit, hemoglobin level, and platelet count Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), also known as acute nonlymphocytic leukemia Primarily affects those over 40; the incidence increases with age. Survival rates for AML have improved with the use of autologous and allogenic bone marrow transplants. Infections, particularly those of the mucous membranes, respiratory tract, and skin Normal, decreased, or increased white blood cell count Bone or joint pain, fever without infection, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and weight loss Chronic leukemias Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) Primarily affects men, with 72 being the average age at diagnosis. CLL runs a long course (4 to 10 years) and rarely progresses to acute leukemia. Enlarged spleen Lymphadenopathy Chronic myelogenous leukemia, or chronic granulocytic leukemia Primarily affects those over age 20; the incidence increases with age. HepatomegalyTypes of leukemia 8:50:46 PM132 Hematologic disorders For a blood or plasma transfusion to be safe, the patient and donor must have compatible blood types. The chart below allows you to determine compatibility. Keep in mind that, before transfusing begins, the blood product must be cross- matched to fully establish donor-recipient compatibility. Blood product compatibility chart Recipient blood typeCompatible whole blood type Compatible red blood cell typeCompatible plasma type (Rh match not needed) O Rh+ O Rh+, O Rh O Rh+, O Rh O, A, B, AB O Rh O Rh O Rh O, A, B, AB A Rh+ A Rh+, A Rh A Rh+, A Rh Rh Rh, Rh AB B B Rh Rh Rh, Rh AB A Rh, B Rh, O RhABBlood and plasma transfusion compatibility Patients with low-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia may not receive treatment if they're asymptomatic Stem cell transplantation is used to treat leukemia In allogenic transplantation, donor stem cells are transplanted into the patient Before transplantation, the patient undergoes chemotherapy and total body radiation to elimi- nate the leukemic cells; these procedures destroy all the patient's bone marrow in preparation for grafting from the donor The principal complication of this type of transplantation is graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a type of organ rejection in which the transplanted cells reject the patient An alternative method is to harvest the patient's own stem cells during remission, treat the cells to remove residual tumor cells, and reinfuse them after the patient undergoes immunosuppressant chemotherapy and radiation therapy; this method, called autologous stem cell transplantation, avoids GVHD because the patient receives his own cells Transfusion therapy may be necessary to treat severe thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and anemia resulting from the disease process or from treatment (see Blood and plasma transfusion compatability ) Most RBC transfusions involve 250 to 300 mL/unit of packed RBCs; whole blood is seldom trans- fused to treat leukemia The blood must be refrigerated until it's used The nurse must take baseline vital signs before transfusion, monitor cardiac status before and during transfusion, con rm blood product compatibility with the patient's blood type, administer blood through a lter (only with normal saline solution), check the blood according to facility pol- icy with another professional nurse, infuse it slowly (2 to 4 hours/unit), observe for reactions, and record vital signs at least hourly and at the end of the transfusion (see Guide to immediate transfusion reactions ) Med-Surg_Chap08.indd 132 Med-Surg_Chap08.indd 132 8/3/2011 8:50:46 PM 8/3/2011 8:50:46 PMLeukemia 133 Any patient receiving a transfusion of blood or blood products is at risk for a transfusion reaction. An immediate reaction may occur during the transfusion itself or several hours after the transfusion. The chart below describes immediate reactions. Reaction Cause Signs and symptoms Nursing interventions Acute hemolytic Administration of incompatible blood Chest pain Dyspnea Facial fl ushing Fever Chills Hypotension Flank pain Bloody oozing at the infusion or surgical incision site Nausea Tachycardia Monitor the patient carefully, especially during the rst 15 minutes of any transfusion. If you see signs of a reaction, stop the transfusion immediately. Administer I.V. fl uids, oxygen, epinephrine, and a vasopressor, as ordered. Observe the patient for signs of coagulopathy. Bacterial contaminationContamination of blood product Chills Fever Vomiting Abdominal cramping Diarrhea Shock Provide broad-spectrum antibiotics, as prescribed. Monitor the patient for fever for several hours after completion of the transfusion. Obtain blood cultures from a site other than I.V. infusion site. Keep all blood bags and tubing and send them to the blood bank. Febrile nonhemolyticBacterial lipopolysaccharides Antileukocyte recipient antibodies directed against donor white blood cells Fever within 2 hours of transfusion Chills Rigor Headache Palpitation Cough Tachycardia Relieve signs and symptoms with an antipyretic. If the patient requires further transfusions, consider using a leukocyte removal lter. Transfusion- related acute lung injuryGranulocyte antibodies in the donor or recipient that cause complement and histamine release Severe respiratory distress within 6 hours of transfusion Fever Chills Cyanosis Hypotension Stop the transfusion immediately. Provide oxygen as needed. Monitor pulse oximetry. Prepare for intubation and ventilatory support and hemodynamic monitoring. Allergic reaction Allergen in donor blood Urticaria Fever Nausea and vomiting Anaphylaxis (facial swelling, laryngeal edema, respiratory distress) in extreme cases Stop the transfusion and administer antihistamine, corticosteroid, or epinephrine, as ordered. Prepare for intubation and respiratory support if the patient develops anaphylaxis.Guide to immediate transfusion reactions (continued ) to transfusion reactions Platelet transfusions may be prescribed; a 6-unit I.V. bolus of platelets should be infused over 20 to 30 minutes Platelets shouldn't be refrigerated The nurse must take baseline vital signs before transfusion, premedicate with steroids or anti- histamines, as prescribed, to prevent reactions, and administer platelets through a lter (only with normal saline solution) WBC transfusions must be infused within 24 hours of collection; the process for WBC transfusions is similar to that for RBC transfusions /H18546Nursing interventions Follow infection-control procedures if the WBC count is low\u2014for example, place a severely neutro- penic patient in a private room, with no fl owers, plants, or fresh fruits; avoid unnecessary invasive pro- cedures; limit patient contact with infected personnel or visitors; and teach hand hygiene techniques to the patient, family, and visitors If the patient has a low platelet count, monitor blood counts and take precautions to prevent bleeding\u2014for example, avoid parenteral injections, limit the number of venipunctures, and advise the patient to use an electric razor for shaving Prevent or manage stomatitis by inspecting the oral cavity daily and encouraging oral care with per- oxide or saline solution on a regular basis Teach the patient how to care for an indwelling vascular access device and how to detect signs of infection Educate patients undergoing chemotherapy about the effects, adverse effects, and length of treatment Provide supplemental feedings as prescribed Conserve the patient's energy, but promote his independence Provide emotional support to the patient and his family, and encourage the patient and his family to verbalize feelings Multiple myeloma /H18546Description Multiple myeloma is a malignancy of plasma cells that can invade the bone marrow, lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and kidneys and leads to bone destruction throughout the body The malignant plasma cells produce an increased amount of a speci c nonfunctional immunoglobulinReaction Cause Signs and symptoms Nursing interventions Transfusion- associated circulatory overloadRapid infusion of blood Excessive volume of transfusion Chest tightness Chills Dyspnea Tachypnea Hypoxemia Hypertension and jugular vein distention that occurs 2 to 6 hours after transfusion Monitor intake and output, breath sounds, and blood pressure. Administer diuretics as needed. Watch elderly patients and those with a history of cardiac disease carefully because they are at higher risk. Hypocalcemia Rapid infusion of citrate-treated blood resulting in the citrate binding to calcium Arrhythmias Hypotension Muscle cramps Nausea and vomiting Seizures Prolonged QT interval Administer I.V. calcium gluconate as ordered. Monitor the patient's electrocardiogram for arrhythmias or a prolonged QT interval. Monitor patients with elevated potassium levels closely because they're at greater risk for hypocalcemia. lymphoma 135 The disorder usually occurs in black men between ages 50 and 70; men are 50% more likely to develop the disease than women Other risks include radiation exposure, family history, obesity, and occupational exposure in petroleum-related industries /H18546Signs and symptoms Confusion, weakness, dizziness, weight loss, fractures, renal failure, skeletal deformities, and con- stant, severe bone pain may occur Anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia\u2014with resulting bleeding, infection, shortness of breath, weakness, and protein in blood and urine\u2014may also occur /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Serum and urine protein electrophoresis showing immunoglobulin or beta2-microglobulin are indica- tive of multiple myeloma; urine studies may show Bence Jones proteins and hypercalciuria Bone X-rays or MRI may show bone destruction Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy may show an increased number of immature plasma cells Chemotherapy suppresses plasma cell growth, and radiation therapy may be used to treat bone lesions and relieve pain Radiation therapy may be used to damage myeloma cells and stop growth Patients with multiple myeloma may also receive interferon to slow the growth of the myeloma cells and thalidomide to inhibit angiogenesis Autologous bone marrow transplantation isn't a cure but may put the patient into remission for a period; allogenic transplant carries a higher risk of serious complications but produces longer-lasting remissions Plasmapheresis is sometimes used to temporarily remove the high-myeloma protein and thereby improve symptoms Hypercalcemia may be managed with a diuretic, hydration, or a phosphate Other therapies include bortezomib (Velcade) for resistant forms and thalidomide (Thalomid) /H18546Nursing interventions Educate the patient and his family about diagnostic and treatment procedures and adverse effects Assess the patient for pain, and administer an analgesic regularly Instruct the patient on safety measures to prevent fractures of affected bones; direct the patient not to walk without assistance; have the patient use devices, such as splints or braces, to prevent injury and reduce pain Encourage the patient to drink plenty of fl uids, or administer I.V. fl uids, to dilute calcium, prevent dehydration, and prevent renal precipitates Assess the patient for signs and symptoms of infection and bleeding, and take measures to prevent their occurrence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma /H18546Description Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma describes a group of malignant neoplasms arising from abnormal lymphocytes that affect the immune system; this disease is usually disseminated when diagnosed and produces systemic symptoms It may be associated with viral infection, congenital immunode ciency, or immunosuppression after organ transplantation The prognosis is poor but depends on the histologic type and progression of the disease /H18546Signs and symptoms Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma can affect any organ or tissue and produces a wide range of symptoms Signs and symptoms resemble those of Hodgkin's disease Fever, painless lymphadenopathy, profuse sweating (especially at night), severe pruritus, abdominal pain or swelling, and weight loss are common signs and symptoms /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnostic procedures are similar to those for Hodgkin's disease; however, no Reed-Sternberg cells are present Staging is similar to Hodgkin's disease (see Staging lymphomas, page 130) 8:50:47 PM136 Hematologic disorders Radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and stem cell transplantation are the principal treatments Biological response modi ers, such as interferon and monoclonal antibodies, also may be used to change the tumor-host relationship Radioimmunotherapy may also be used /H18546Nursing interventions Educate the patient and his family about transfusions, chemotherapy, and stem cell transplantation Initiate interventions similar to those for leukemia Prevent infection Support nutritional status Polycythemia vera /H18546Description Polycythemia vera is a proliferative disorder of myeloid stem cells that results in elevated levels of RBCs, WBCs, and platelets in the circulating blood In the early phase and for 10 or more years, hematocrit is elevated; in later stages, the bone marrow becomes brotic, with the resultant inability to produce as many cells, while the spleen resumes its embryonic function of hematopoiesis and enlarges The disease eventually progresses into myeloid metaplasia with myelo brosis or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) The median age at onset is 65, and the median survival is 10 years after diagnosis Death results from thrombosis, hemorrhage, or complications of AML /H18546Signs and symptoms Patients typically have a ruddy complexion and splenomegaly Symptoms of increased blood volume or increased blood viscosity include headache, dizziness, tinnitus, fatigue, paresthesias, blurred vision, angina, claudication, dyspnea, thrombophlebitis, and hypertension Pruritus, gout, and burning in the ngers and toes may also occur Complications include stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), thrombotic events, and bleeding from dys- functional platelets /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Laboratory tests include hematocrit, which can initially exceed 60%; leukocyte and platelet counts are elevated, and uric acid levels are often increased Treatment aims to reduce the high blood cell mass; regular phlebotomy is performed to keep hema- tocrit below 45% Drug therapy may include chemotherapeutics agents to suppress bone marrow function as well as platelet inhibitors /H18546Nursing interventions Be alert for thrombotic complications such as deep vein thrombosis, and observe for excessive bleeding Control pruritus with warm or cool baths and antihistamines as ordered Teach the patient and family about the disease process and how to prevent complications Provide emotional support Thrombocytopenia /H18546Description Thrombocytopenia is an abnormally low level of circulating platelets (less than 100,000/mm3) due to decreased production, decreased survival, increased destruction, or increased sequestration of platelets in the spleen It may result from antibody production (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura [ITP]), bone marrow radiation, excessive alcohol use, or a disease, such as aplastic anemia or leukemia, DIC, hypothermia, or an autoimmune disorder 136 Med-Surg_Chap08.indd 136 8/3/2011 8:50:47 PM 8/3/2011 8:50:47 PMReview questions 137 It also may result from drug therapy with an analgesic, an antibiotic (resulting in idiopathic throm- bocytopenic purpura), thiazide diuretic; although the platelet count may return to normal 1 to 2 weeks after the drug is withdrawn, more than 90% of adults don't go into spontaneous remission /H18546Signs and symptoms Ecchymoses, petechiae, and purpura may affect the skin Epistaxis, gingival bleeding, severe hemorrhage, and menorrhagia also may occur /H18546Diagnosis and treatment The diagnosis is made by examining the platelet count, blood smear, bleeding time, and bone mar- row to determine whether the platelet loss is caused by lack of production or increased destruction Treatment focuses on correcting the underlying cause For ITP, the principal treatment is corticosteroid therapy; for severe or resistant cases, immunosup- pressant therapy or splenectomy may be used; platelet transfusions aren't helpful because of continued platelet destruction For other types of thrombocytopenias, platelet transfusions are indicated and can increase the platelet count for 1 to 3 days /H18546Nursing interventions Monitor platelet counts; the patient is more susceptible to injury and bleeding when the platelet count falls below 60,000/mm3 and may develop spontaneous hemorrhage, particularly cerebral hemor- rhage when the platelet count drops below 20,000/mm3 Test all stools and urine for blood Avoid taking the patient's temperature rectally and giving injections I.M. Apply pressure to venipuncture and arterial puncture sites Provide meticulous oral care to prevent stomatitis Tell the patient to use only electric shavers and to avoid contact sports, elective surgery, tooth extraction, and the use of aspirin and ibuprofen Review questions 1. When assessing a patient with anemia from acute blood loss, the nurse would expect to nd which of the following? /H18540A. Sudden onset of symptoms, hypotension, and tachycardia /H18540B. Exertional dyspnea, poor nutrition, and hypotension /H18540C. Sudden onset of symptoms, glossitis, and tachycardia /H18540D. Fatigue, neuropathy, and tachycardia Correct answer: A Acute blood loss occurs suddenly. Hypotension and tachycardia are compensatory mechanisms in response to rapid loss of blood volume. Although anemia may produce exertional dyspnea and hypotension, Option B is incorrect because poor nutrition is neither a symptom nor a cause of anemia due to blood loss. Options C and D are incorrect because anemia due to acute blood loss produces neither glossitis nor neuropathy. Hematologic disorders 2. When teaching safety precautions to a patient with thrombocytopenia, the nurse should include which of the following directives? /H18540A. Eat foods high in iron. /H18540B. Avoid products that contain aspirin. /H18540C. Avoid people with respiratory tract infections. /H18540D. Eat only cooked vegetables. Correct answer: B Patients with a low platelet count should avoid products that contain aspirin because they increase the tendency to bleed. Option A would be important to teach the patient with anemia. Options C and D are correct for the patient with leukopenia. 3. When assessing the patient, the nurse knows that the body system least affected by multiple myeloma is the: /H18540A. skeletal system. /H18540B. renal system. /H18540C. nervous system. /H18540D. cardiovascular system. Correct answer: D Multiple myeloma usually doesn't have a direct effect on the heart. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because multiple myeloma usually affects the skeletal, renal, and nervous systems. 4. The nurse is reviewing assessment data for a patient with a diagnosis of stage III Hodgkin's disease. This diagnosis is most strongly supported by lymphatic involvement on both sides of Correct answer: B With stage III Hodgkin's disease, malignant cells are widely disseminated to lymph nodes on both sides of the diaphragm. Options A, B, and D are incorrect because these structures aren't involved in the staging of Hodgkin's disease. 5. A 50-year-old male with a diagnosis of leukemia is responding poorly to treatment. He is tearful and trying to express his feelings, but he is having dif culty. The nurse should rst: /H18540A. tell him that she will leave for now but she will be back. /H18540B. offer to call pastoral care. /H18540C. ask if he would like her to sit with him while he collects his thoughts. /H18540D. tell him that she can understand how he is feeling. Correct answer: C The patient needs to feel that people are concerned with his situation. Option A is incorrect because leaving the patient doesn't show acceptance of his feelings. Option B is incorrect because offering to call pastoral care may be helpful for some patients but should be done after the nurse has spent time with the patient. Option D is incorrect because telling the patient that she understands how he's feeling is inappropriate because it doesn't help him express his feelings.

Type A or type O /H18540B. Type B or type O /H18540C. Type AB or type O /H18540D. Type A or type B Correct answer: B Type B blood contains B antigens and anti-A antibodies, but no anti-B antibodies. Therefore, a patient with type B blood can receive type B or type O RBCs, which contain neither anti-A nor anti-B antibodies. Options A, C, and D are incorrect because blood type B contains anti-A antibodies. 7. Which type of anemia results from de ciency of all the blood's formed elements, caused by failure of the bone marrow to generate enough new cells? /H18540A. Sickle cell anemia /H18540B. Folic acid Aplastic de ciency anemia Correct answer: C Aplastic anemia usually develops when damaged or destroyed stem cells inhibit RBC production. Sickle cell anemia (Option A) is a genetic disorder that causes malformation of RBCs. Folic acid de ciency anemia (Option B) and iron de ciency anemia (Option D) are not related to bone marrow failure. 8. Which disorder results from a de ciency of circulating platelets? /H18540A. Hemophilia Correct answer: D Thrombocytopenia, the most common hemorrhagic disorder, results from a de - ciency of circulating platelets. Hemophilia (Option A) and von Willebrand's disease (Option C) are genetic clotting factor disorders. Sickle cell anemia (Option B) is a genetic disorder that causes malforma-tion of RBCs. 9. A patient with Hodgkin's disease has lymph node involvement on both sides of the diaphragm and involvement of the spleen. According to the Ann Harbor classi cation system, what stage lymphoma does this patient have? /H18540A. Stage I /H18540B. Stage II /H18540C. Stage III /H18540D. Stage IV Correct answer: C Stage III involves lymph node regions on both sides of the diaphragm; the spleen may also be involved. Stage I (Option A) involves a single lymph node regions. Stage II (Option B) involves two or more lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm. Stage IV (Option D) may involve isolated extralymphatic organs as well as nonregional nodes. PM140 Hematologic disorders 10. A patient with anemia from acute blood loss has been admitted to the medical-surgical unit. What assess- ment ndings would the nurse expect to nd? /H18540A. Night sweats, weight loss, and diarrhea /H18540B. Dyspnea, tachycardia, and pallor /H18540C. Nausea, vomiting, and anorexia /H18540D. Itching, rash, and jaundice Correct answer: B Signs of anemia from acute blood loss include dyspnea, tachycardia, and pallor, as well as fatigue and irritability. Night sweats, weight loss, and diarrhea (Option A) may signal acquired immunode ciency syndrome. Nausea, vomiting, and anorexia (Option C) may be signs of hepatitis B. Itching, rash, and jaundice (Option D) may result from an allergic or hemolytic reaction.

Is the cough recent? If not recent, how long has he experienced it? Has it changed recently? When a patient produces sputum, ask him to estimate the amount produced in teaspoons or another common measurement; ask him at what time of day he coughs the most; question him about the color and consistency of his sputum; ask whether its character has changed recently. If so, how? Does he cough up blood? If a patient wheezes, ask when the wheezing occurs. What makes the patient wheeze? Does he wheeze loudly enough for others to hear it? What helps stop the wheezing? If the patient has chest pain, ask him where the pain is located, what it feels like, what characteristics it has, whether it moves or radiates, how long it lasts, what causes it to occur, and what makes it better; have him rate the pain on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 0 being no pain and 10 worst pain experienced) Ask about the use of prescription and over-the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, vitamin and nutri- tional supplements, and alternative or complementary therapies used The nurse asks about medical history Question the patient about other respiratory disorders\u2014such as allergies, asthma, cystic brosis, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and upper respiratory tract infections Ask the patient if he has undergone chest or lung surgery The nurse then assesses the family history Ask about a family history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, or tuberculosis Determine if there's a family history of lung cancer The nurse obtains a social history Ask about smoking habits and environmental exposure to irritants such as asbestos Question the patient about his tolerance for exerciseRespiratory disordersRespiratory disorders 9 141 8/2/2011 2:50:32 PM142 Respiratory disorders /H18546Physical assessment The nurse begins with inspection Observe the patient's general appearance; note the patient's position. Is he sitting upright? Leaning forward? In a tripod position? Take note of his level of awareness and general appearance. Does he appear relaxed? Anxious? Uncomfortable? Is he having trouble breathing? Note deformities, masses, or scars of the chest; look for chest wall symmetry at rest and with inspi- ration; note the anterior-posterior chest diameter; observe chest wall movement. Is it paradoxical, or uneven? Note tracheal deviation; look for spinal abnormalities such as kyphosis; note whether the costal angle is enlarged Observe the patient's respirations, noting rate, depth, rhythm, and inspiratory-expiratory ratio; look for the use of accessory muscles with breathing, pursed lip breathing, nostril fl aring, and retracting Observe the color of the patient's skin, lips, mucous membranes, and nail beds; check nails for clubbing Next, the nurse uses palpation Palpate the chest for temperature, dryness, crepitus, pain, and tactile fremitus Check for respiratory excursion Then the nurse percusses the heart Percuss the anterior and posterior chest, noting lung boundaries and movement of the diaphragm Also note percussion sounds; describe any abnormal ones, including the location and size of the area The nurse continues with auscultation Auscultate the anterior, posterior, and lateral chest, comparing breath sounds Classify each sound according to its intensity, location, pitch, duration, and characteristic; note whether the sound occurs during inhalation, exhalation, or both Auscultate for vocal fremitus, noting bronchophony, egophony, and whispered pectoriloquy Acute respiratory distress syndrome /H18546Description Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a severe form of lung injury, occurs when the lungs can't maintain the oxygen-carbon dioxide balance Although its exact cause is unknown, ARDS occurs as a result of diffuse alveolar damage; its mortal- ity rate is 50% or higher; death is usually due to a multisystem failure or an infection Risk factors for ARDS include aspiration pneumonia, drug overdose, fat or amniotic emboli, head injury, hemorrhagic shock, massive blood transfusions or transfusion reactions, near drowning, pulmo-nary contusion, sepsis, smoke inhalation, and trauma With ARDS, capillaries leak, causing interstitial edema; this decreases blood fl ow to the lungs and causes platelet aggregation The respiratory membrane becomes infl amed; alveolar edema develops, leading to pulmonary edema Lung compliance decreases, and patches of atelectasis develop; the patient hyperventilates, thereby causing hypocapnia and hypoxemia and leading to multisystem organ dysfunction s yndrome A ventilation-perfusion mismatch occurs /H18546Signs and symptoms Vital sign measurements reveal increased blood pressure, tachycardia, and tachypnea (along with increased respiratory effort and accessory muscle use) Med-Surg_Chap09.indd 142 Med-Surg_Chap09.indd 142 8/2/2011 2:50:32 PM 8/2/2011 2:50:32 PMAcute respiratory failure 143 Other symptoms may include barotrauma symptoms, bibasilar crackles, crepitus, cyano- sis, decreased oxygen therapy, restlessness, and thick, frothy sputum /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Early diagnosis and prompt treatment allow for successful management of ARDS Arterial blood gas (ABG) studies reveal decreased partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pa o2) unresponsive to supplemental oxygen A pulmonary artery (PA) catheter inserted to measure pressures reveals pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) of less than 18 mm Hg Chest X-ray shows bilateral in ltrates (in early stages) and lung elds with ground-glass appearance, irreversible hypoxemia, and massive consolidation seen as \"white lung\" (in later stages) Mechanical ventilation may be necessary Raising the fraction of inspired oxygen (F io2) with a ventilator helps to reverse hypoxemia but may increase the risk of oxygen toxicity and pulmonary brosis Supplementing mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) provides a constant pressure that prevents the alveoli from collapsing PEEP allows the use of a lower F io2 to obtain an adequate Pa o2 Pressure control ventilation that prevents overdistention of the alveoli and inverse ratio ventilation in which inspiration is longer than expiration may also be used A diuretic may be administered to reduce pulmonary edema An antibiotic is used to treat any respiratory tract infection or underlying systemic infection Pharmacologic paralysis is used to decrease oxygen consumption; the patient must be sedated for this treatment Vasopressors are given to maintain blood pressure Electrolyte and acid-base imbalances are corrected to maintain cellular integrity /H18546Nursing interventions Make sure the patient maintains bed rest in semi-Fowler's or the prone position, if possible, to improve oxygenation Provide oxygen therapy (and mechanical ventilation, if indicated) to maintain Pa o2 above 60 mm Hg; this will maintain oxygenation and help to reverse hypoxemia Implement chest physiotherapy to loosen secretions If the patient isn't on mechanical ventilation, teach him effective coughing and deep-breathing exer- cises to maximize lung expansion and reexpand collapsed alveoli Suction the patient's airway as needed to maintain patency and to clear secretions; sterile technique prevents bacterial contamination of lower airways Administer drugs to relieve pain and discomfort as needed If the patient is on mechanical ventilation, administer a paralyzant and a sedative as necessary Monitor fl uid intake and output to determine the effectiveness of diuretic therapy Frequently reposition the patient to prevent complications of immobility, help loosen secretions, and promote lung perfusion Provide 2,500 calories daily to prevent weakness and increase immune response; use enteral or par- enteral feeding if needed Teach relaxation techniques, and encourage the patient not to ght the ventilator Because a mechanically ventilated patient can't speak, provide communication alternatives, such as letter and picture boards Acute respiratory failure /H18546Description In acute respiratory failure, the lungs' inability to adequately maintain arterial oxygenation or elimi- nate carbon dioxide results in 143 8/2/2011 2:50:32 PM 8/2/2011 2:50:32 disorders The disorder is classi ed as hypoxemic (type I) or hypercapnic (type II) Primarily hypercapnic respiratory failure results from inadequate alveolar ventilation caused by a ventilation-perfusion (V\u00b7/Q\u00b7) mismatch and shunting Primarily hypoxemic respiratory failure results from inadequate oxygen exchange between the alveoli and capillaries The disorder also commonly occurs as a combination of hypercapnic and hypoxemic respiratory failure Causes include accumulated secretions secondary to cough suppression; airway irritants; any condi- tion that increases the work of breathing and decreases the respiratory drive of patients with COPD; bronchospasm; central nervous system depression; disorders of the peripheral nervous system, respira-tory muscles, and chest wall; endocrine pulmonary embolism /H18546Signs and symptoms Signs include changes in mental status, such as confusion, somnolence, and cyanosis of the oral mucosa, lips, and nail beds Assessment may reveal absent breath sounds, wheezes, rhonchi, and crackles in the lung elds Other signs and symptoms include yawning and use of accessory muscles, pursed-lip breathing, nasal fl aring, ashen skin, and tachypnea /H18546Diagnosis treatment ABG analysis reveals hypercapnia (partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide [Pa co2] greater than 50 mm Hg) and hypoxemia (Pa o2 less than 60 mm Hg) on room air If a bacterial infection is involved, laboratory tests show an increased serum white blood cell (WBC) count; blood cultures, Gram stain, and sputum cultures reveal the pathogen Serum hemoglobin and hematocrit show decreased oxygen-carrying capacity Chest X-rays may reveal underlying pulmonary diseases or conditions, such as emphysema, atelectasis, lesions, pneumothorax, in ltrates, and Pulse oximetry may show decreased arterial oxygen saturation Treatment may include mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal or a tracheostomy tube If the underlying cause is heart failure, the patient will need fl uid restriction Initially, the patient is maintained on bed rest, progressing to activity as tolerated Oxygen therapy increases the pressure of arterial oxygen Antibiotics treat any underlying infection Bronchodilators, such as terbutaline, albuterol, theophylline, ammation agents, such dobutamine, perfusion Nitrates, such as nitroglycerin or nitroprusside, reduce myocardial oxygen demand Morphine serves as an adjunct treatment for acute pulmonary edema Diuretics alleviate heart failure /H18546Nursing interventions Monitor the patient's vital signs, pulse oximetry readings, and ECG Administer prescribed drugs as indicated (via inhalation, the oral route, nebulization, or I.V., as appropriate) Orient the patient frequently Administer humidi ed, supplemental oxygen as ordered Maintain a patent airway Help clear the patient's secretions with postural drainage and chest physiotherapy; also suction as necessary Encourage pursed-lip breathing Encourage the use of an incentive spirometer to promote lung expansion Reposition the patient every 1 to 2 hours to help mobilize secretions Perform or assist with oral hygiene Med-Surg_Chap09.indd 144 Med-Surg_Chap09.indd 144 8/2/2011 2:50:32 PM 8/2/2011 2:50:32 PMAsthma 145 Position the patient for comfort, with the head of the bed elevated, if appropriate, to promote optimal gas exchange Maintain a normal body temperature with antipyretics Cluster nursing activities and schedule care to provide frequent rest periods Prepare for intubation and mechanical ventilation if needed Provide sedation as necessary Provide education and emotional support to the patient and family Asthma /H18546Description Asthma is a chronic reactive airway disorder that involves episodic, reversible airway obstruction resulting from bronchospasms, increased mucus secretions, and mucosal airfl ow obstruction, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness Asthma can result from several types of triggers exposure to tobacco or wood smoke breathing polluted air inhaling other respiratory irritants, such as perfumes or cleaning products exposure to airway irritants at the workplace breathing in allergy-causing substances (allergens), such as molds, dust, or animal dander upper respiratory tract infection, such as a cold, infl uenza, sinusitis, or bronchitis exposure to cold dry weather emotional excitement or stress physical exertion or exercise (exercise-induced asthma) refl ux of stomach acid (gastroesophageal refl ux disease, or GERD) ingestion of sul tes, an additive found in some foods and wine Comorbidities include GERD, drug-induced asthma, and other allergic reactions, such as eczema, rashes, and temporary edema /H18546Signs and symptoms Overall signs and symptoms of asthma range from mild wheezing and dyspnea to life-threatening respiratory failure; signs and symptoms of bronchial airway obstruction may persist between acute episodes An asthma attack may begin dramatically, with simultaneous onset of severe, multiple signs and symptoms, or insidiously, with gradually increasing respiratory distress (see Determining asthma's severity, page 146) Exposure to a particular allergen is followed by a sudden onset of dyspnea and wheezing and by tightness in the chest accompanied by a cough that produces thick, clear, or yellow sputum (cough, dyspnea, and wheezing are the three most common signs and symptoms of asthma) An attack often starts during the night or in the early morning Physical ndings may include visible dyspnea, use of accessory respiratory muscles, complaints of chest tightness, diaphoresis, increased anteroposterior thoracic diameter, and hyperresonance Tachycardia, tachypnea, mild paradoxus exacer- bation progresses Inspiratory and expiratory wheezes may occur, along with wheezing and coughing (which may be exercise-induced), a prolonged expiratory phase of respiration, and diminished breath sounds The occurrence of cyanosis, confusion, and lethargy indicate the onset of life-threatening status asth- maticus and respiratory failure /H18546Diagnosis and treatment ABG analysis provides the best indication of an attack's severity and may reveal hypoxemia dur- ing an acute attack; in acutely severe asthma, Pa o2 is less than 60 mm Hg, Pa co2 is 40 mm Hg or more, Med-Surg_Chap09.indd 145 Med-Surg_Chap09.indd 145 8/2/2011 2:50:32 PM 8/2/2011 2:50:32 PM146 Respiratory disorders The severity of asthma is classi ed by the: frequency, severity, and duration of symptoms degree of airfl ow obstruction (spirometry measure) or peak expiratory fl ow (PEF) frequency of nighttime symptoms and the degree that the asthma interferes with daily activities. Severity can change over time, and even milder cases can become severe in an uncontrolled attack. Long-term thera-py depends on whether the patient's asthma is classi ed as mild intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, or se-vere persistent. For all patients, quick relief can be obtained by using a short-acting bronchodilator (two to four puffs of a short-acting inhaled beta2-adrenergic agonist as needed for symptoms). However, the use of a short-acting broncho-dilator more than twice a week in patients with intermittent asthma or daily or increasing use in patients with persistent asthma may indicate the need to initiate or increase long-term control therapy. Mild intermittent asthma The signs and symptoms of mild intermittent asthma include: daytime symptoms that occur no more than twice a week nighttime symptoms that occur no more than twice a month lung function testing (either PEF or forced expiratory vol- ume in 1 second) of 80% of predicted value or higher PEF that varies no more than 20%. Severe exacerbations, separated by long, symptomless periods of normal lung function, indicate mild intermittent asthma. A course of systemic corticosteroids is recommended for these exacerbations; otherwise, daily medication isn't required. Mild persistent asthma The signs and symptoms of mild persistent asthma include: daytime symptoms that occur 3 to 6 days a week nighttime symptoms that occur three to four times a month lung function testing of 80% of predicted value or higher PEF that varies between 20% and 30%.The preferred treatment for mild persistent asthma is low- dose inhaled corticosteroids, but alternative treatments include cromolyn, leukotriene modi er, nedocromil, and sustained-release theophylline. Moderate persistent asthma The signs and symptoms of moderate persistent asthma include: daily daytime symptoms nighttime symptoms that occur at least weekly lung function testing of 60% to 80% of predicted value PEF that varies more than 30%. The preferred treatment for moderate persistent asthma is low- or medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids combined with a long-acting inhaled beta2-adrenergic agonist. Alter-native treatments include increasing inhaled corticosteroids within the medium-dose range or low- or medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids with either leukotriene modi er or theophylline. For recurring exacerbations, the preferred treatment is to increase inhaled corticosteroids within the medium-dose range and add a long-acting inhaled beta2-adrenergic agonist. The alternative treatment is to increase inhaled cor-ticosteroids within the medium-dose range and add either leukotriene modi er or theophylline. Severe persistent asthma The signs and symptoms of severe persistent asthma include: continual daytime symptoms frequent nighttime symptoms lung function testing of 60% of predicted value or lower PEF that varies more than 30%. The preferred treatment for severe persistent asthma in- cludes high-dose inhaled corticosteroids combined with long-acting inhaled beta2-adrenergic agonists. Long-term administration of corticosteroid tablets or syrup (2 mg/kg/day, not to exceed 60 mg/day) may be used to reduce the need for systemic corticosteroid therapy.Determining asthma's severity and pH is usually decreased; normal Pa co2 during an acute attack may signal impending respiratory failure Radioallergosorbent testing shows increased serum immunoglobulin E levels as a result of an allergic reaction A complete blood count (CBC) including WBC count and differential shows increased eosinophil count in acute phases Chest X-rays may show hyperinfl ation, fl attened 8/2/2011 2:50:32 Pulmonary function tests commonly show decreased peak fl ow rates and forced expiratory volume in 1 second, low-normal or decreased vital capacity, and increased total lung and residual capacities, although results may be normal between attacks Skin testing may identify speci c allergens Bronchial challenge testing shows the clinical signi cance of allergens identi ed by skin testing Pulse oximetry measurements may show decreased oxygen saturation Peak fl ow monitoring reveals a result of less than 80% of personal best; a reading below 50% of per- sonal best indicates a severe exacerbation Treatment involves identifying and avoiding precipitating factors and desensitizing the patient to speci c antigens Generally, asthma medications are divided into two categories: quick relief for relief of immediate symptoms and long-acting medications to control the underlying infl ammation Quick-relief bronchodilators an prednisolone, and prednisone, exacerbation and progression during moderate or severe exacerbations Corticosteroids for persistent asthma such as (Tilade) inhaled before exercise reduce bronchospasm /H18546Nursing interventions Give prescribed inhalers and asthma medications Place the patient in high Fowler's position Encourage pursed-lip and diaphragmatic breathing Administer prescribed humidi ed oxygen Adjust oxygen according to the patient's vital signs and ABG values Assist with intubation and mechanical ventilation, if appropriate Perform postural drainage and chest percussion, if tolerated If the patient is intubated, suction as needed Treat the patient's dehydration with I.V. or oral fl uids as tolerated Keep the room temperature comfortable Use an air conditioner or a fan in hot, humid weather Monitor the patient's vital signs, intake and output, response to treatment, signs and symptoms of theophylline toxicity, breath sounds, ABG results, pulmonary function test results, pulse oximetry, complications of corticosteroid treatment, and anxiety level Atelectasis /H18546Description Atelectasis is the partial or total collapse of the functioning alveoli Airway obstruction, COPD, ascites, and lung compression resulting from hemothorax, pneumo- thorax, or tumor can cause atelectasis; atelectasis also is a common complication of thoracic and upper abdominal surgery that can occur 24 to 48 hours postoperatively General anesthesia, immobility, lung disease, obesity, opioid use, pain, and smoking increase the risk of atelectasis A patient with atelectasis has decreased ventilation because the collapsed alveoli can't exchange gases; this decreased ventilation leads to hypoxemia Stasis of mucus leads to bacterial growth and Med-Surg_Chap09.indd 8/2/2011 2:50:32 PM 8/2/2011 2:50:32 PM148 Respiratory disorders /H18546Signs and symptoms Vital sign assessment typically reveals fever (which may occur 24 to 48 hours postoperatively), tachy- cardia, and tachypnea Auscultation may reveal crackles and decreased breath sounds over the affected area Other effects may include cyanosis, dyspnea, and increased sputum production /H18546Diagnosis and treatment The patient should undergo ABG studies, chest X-ray, and sputum culture A bronchodilator is administered to dilate bronchioles and promote secretion removal An antibiotic is administered to treat infection If present, tumors are removed surgically or treated with radiation therapy A chest tube is inserted for a patient with hemothorax (to drain blood) or pneumothorax (to reinfl ate the lung) /H18546Nursing interventions Encourage the patient to cough and breathe deeply to maximize lung expansion and reexpand col- lapsed alveoli; use an incentive spirometer hourly after surgery Provide adequate hydration to liquefy secretions; thin secretions are easier to expectorate Implement chest physiotherapy to help clear secretions; postural drainage uses gravity to clear secre- tions, whereas percussion and vibration loosen secretions, making them easier to cough up Suction the patient's airway to maintain patency and to clear secretions Provide oxygen therapy to improve Pa o2 and maintain adequate oxygenation Medicate for pain or discomfort as needed, which will allow the patient to cough and deep-breathe effectively Teach the patient to use a pillow to splint abdominal and chest incisions during coughing exercises Encourage early ambulation and frequent position changes to prevent complications of immobility and promote lung expansion Cancer, laryngeal /H18546Description Laryngeal cancer affects the epithelial lining of the mucous membrane of the larynx, most commonly as squamous cell carcinoma; it usually affects men in their 60s and 70s Although laryngeal cancer has no proven cause, two major risk factors are cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption; other risk factors include frequent laryngitis, poor nutrition, and compromised immunity /H18546Signs and symptoms Hoarseness for more than 2 weeks, an early warning sign, may become progressively worse Dysphagia, dyspnea, and hemoptysis may be present Pain may be referred to the ear or throat if ulceration occurs Cervical lymph nodes may be enlarged /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Laryngoscopy shows nodules on the vocal cords, and nodule biopsy reveals cancer cells Radiation therapy and surgery may be used alone or together Partial laryngectomy changes the voice and preserves the respiratory tract Total laryngectomy produces a complete loss of voice and creates a permanent tracheostomy opening /H18546Nursing interventions Encourage deep breathing to maintain respiratory function Suction the patient's airway as needed to maintain patency and to clear secretions Administer oxygen to improve Pa o2 and maintain adequate oxygenation Provide tracheostomy care to prevent infection and maintain the airway Ensure adequate hydration and nutrition while preventing aspiration and aspiration-induced i nfection Have the patient eat slowly and in the sitting position only Provide frequent small meals, and advance the diet as tolerated Have suction equipment readily available Med-Surg_Chap09.indd 148 Med-Surg_Chap09.indd 148 8/2/2011 2:50:32 PM 8/2/2011 2:50:32 PMCancer, lung 149 Provide pain relief as needed to reduce anxiety, and encourage deep breathing and activity If needed, teach the patient and family alternative methods of communication, such as an alphabet board or gesturing Discuss and initiate speech therapy, if appropriate, to maximize remaining vocal function Cancer, lung /H18546Description Lung cancers are classi ed into two major categories: carcinomas carcinomas and (40%) Up to 40% of lung cancers are metastatic; breast, GI, prostate, and renal cancers commonly metasta- size to the lungs Risk factors for lung cancer include cigarette smoking, environmental factors such as air pollution, genetic factors, and occupational exposure to carcinogens Adenocarcinoma tends to grow slowly and is peripherally located; this well-circumscribed tumor seldom cavitates but spreads early to regional lymph nodes Large-cell carcinoma produces large necrotic masses that tend to grow rapidly and are peripherally located; it tends to cavitate, metastasizes early, and spreads extensively Small-cell carcinoma, the most aggressive lung cancer, tends to grow rapidly and is centrally located; it rapidly metastasizes through lymph and blood systems but responds to chemotherapy Squamous cell carcinoma, the most common lung cancer, tends to grow slowly and is centrally located; it produces early local symptoms, tends to cavitate, and metastasizes to intrathoracic sites rst /H18546Signs and symptoms Some lung cancers are asymptomatic; symptoms arise from metastasis to other body areas Dyspnea may range from mild dyspnea during extreme exertion to severe dyspnea at rest Auscultation may reveal decreased breath sounds, localized wheezing, and pleural rub (with pleural effusion) A chronic cough may be nonproductive; however, hemoptysis is common Enlarged lymph nodes and fatigue may occur Finger clubbing may be a late sign of lung cancer Weight loss may occur The patient may report bone pain, chest pain or tightness, joint aching, and shoulder and arm pain Superior vena cava syndrome may cause edema of the face, neck, and upper torso as well as dilated veins in the abdomen and chest /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, MRI, bronchoscopy, sputum cytology, pulmonary function tests, ABG studies, brain and bone scans, and lymph node biopsy may be prescribed Specimens may be obtained for culture by way of bronchoscopy, transthoracic needle biopsy, lobectomy, pneumonectomy, and wedge resection\u2014are used to treat lung cancer Chemotherapy, immunosuppressant therapy, and radiation therapy also may be used (see Nursing implications in oncology care , page 357) Serial thoracentesis or chest tube placement is used for recurrent pleural effusions Laser therapy through a bronchoscope is a palliative measure that relieves endobronchial obstruc- tions caused by nonresectable tumors /H18546Nursing interventions Monitor a patient who has undergone surgery Assess the incision for signs of infection Med-Surg_Chap09.indd 149 Med-Surg_Chap09.indd 149 8/2/2011 2:50:33 PM 8/2/2011 2:50:33 PM150 Respiratory disorders Check the dressing for drainage and the chest tube for proper functioning, air leakage, and amount of drainage Assess lungs for signs of atelectasis Assess the intensity, quality, and location of pain Assess the patient for heart failure caused by fl uid overload, hyponatremia, and renal failure Monitor electrolyte levels to detect hyponatremia or hyperkalemia Monitor the patient's CBC for anemia and leukopenia Assess fl uid intake and output Assess nutritional status Administer oxygen to improve Pa o2, and maintain adequate oxygenation Suction the patient's airway as needed to maintain patency and to clear secretions Provide pain relief as needed to reduce anxiety, and encourage coughing, deep breathing, and early ambulation Position the patient for comfort and adequate respiration Teach relaxation techniques to alleviate anxiety Intervene appropriately for a postoperative patient Ensure adequate hydration to liquefy secretions; thin secretions are easier to expectorate Provide chest physiotherapy; postural drainage uses gravity to clear secretions, and percussion and vibration loosen secretions, making them easier to expectorate Teach effective coughing and deep breathing to promote lung expansion and prevent atelectasis Encourage early ambulation and frequent position changes to prevent complications and promote lung expansion Increase the patient's caloric intake to 2,500 calories daily Although patients may have a poor appetite, their metabolic needs are increased Administer medications to control diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting Encourage the patient to eat frequent, small meals Encourage family members and friends to provide nutritious food that the patient likes Have a patient who has undergone thoracotomy practice arm exercises to promote lung expansion and maintain arm mobility Encourage the patient to express concerns to reduce anxiety, decrease pain, and promote healing If the patient is a smoker, discuss the effects of smoking, and help get him into a smoking cessation program Teach the patient how to improve his quality of life by conserving energy and reorganizing the home so that frequently used items are within reach, and consider employing a homemaking service Chest trauma /H18546Description Rib fracture can result from a blunt or penetrating injury; fractures commonly involve multiple ribs Flail chest is usually caused by blunt trauma; it results when two or more ribs are fractured at two different places on each rib, leaving a rib section that isn't connected at either end Pneumothorax, which can be caused by blunt or penetrating trauma, means that air has entered the pleural cavity; the air causes complete or partial collapse of the lung Tension pneumothorax can be caused by blunt trauma and is life-threatening if untreated because of its effects on respiratory and cardiac function Cardiac tamponade is the accumulation of blood in the pericardial sac, resulting from blunt or pen- etrating injury to the pericardium or heart; it's life-threatening if untreated (see Comparing types of chest trauma ) /H18546Pathophysiology With a rib fracture, pain may cause hypoventilation that leads to atelectasis With a fl ail chest, the fl ail segment moves in a manner opposite that of normal rib movement during respirations; as a result, the lungs can't fully expand Med-Surg_Chap09.indd 150 8/2/2011 2:50:33 PM 8/2/2011 2:50:33 PMChest trauma 151 Signs and symptoms Diagnosis and treatment Nursing care Cardiac tamponade Varied symptoms, depending on speed of blood accumulation Chest pain, hypotension, muffl ed heart sounds, and tachycardia Cyanosis, diaphoresis, dyspnea, and restlessness Distended neck veins Narrowed pulse pressure and paradoxical pulse When tamponade develops more slowly: ascites, edema in arms and legs, liver enlargement Echocardiography can be used to diagnose cardiac tamponade. Central venous pressure, which is elevated in patients with cardiac tamponade, is monitored. Pericardiocentesis is used to remove fl uid from the pericardial sac. The injured area is repaired surgically. I.V. fl uids are rapidly infused. Inotropic drugs are given to improve myocardial contractility. Administer oxygen to maintain adequate oxygenation, improve partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pao 2), and reverse the hypoxemia. Watch for complications, such as ventricu- lar brillation, vasovagal response, or cardiac compression. Flail chest Cyanosis and dyspnea Hypercapnia and hypoxemia Increased respiratory effort Pain on inspiration and on palpa- tion of the injured area Paradoxical movement of the fl ail segment Chest X-ray and arterial blood gas (ABG) studies typically are ordered. Several types of analgesia may be used to relieve pain: patient-controlled analgesia, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, or inter-costal nerve block. A chest tube may be inserted to treat hemothorax or pneumothorax. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be used to stabilize the chest wall. The fl ail segment may need to be repaired surgically. Teach the patient techniques for effective coughing and deep breathing to improve airway clearance. Medicate for pain to promote effective coughing and deep breathing. Provide hydration to liquefy secretions; thin secretions are easier to cough up. Administer oxygen to improve Pao2 and reverse hypoxemia. Suction the patient's airway as needed to maintain patency and to clear secretions. Provide pillows and teach the patient to sup- port and splint the fl ail segment to minimize pain and to allow maximum lung expansion. Pneumothorax Asymmetrical lung expansion Chest pain, crepitus, and dyspnea Decreased or absent breath sounds on the affected side Restlessness Signs of mediastinal shift and ten- sion pneumothorax and ABG studies typi- cally are ordered. Analgesia is provided to relieve pain. A chest tube may be inserted and attached to a suction device. In a three-chamber device, the rst chamber allows for fl uid drainage, the second one is a water seal that acts as a one-way valve to prevent air from entering the pleural cav-ity, and the third one controls the amount of suction, which is needed to remove air from the pleural cavity. In an emergency, a Cook catheter with a Heimlich valve may be used to prevent air from entering the pleural cavity. Administer oxygen to improve Pao2 and reverse hypoxemia. Teach the patient techniques for effective coughing and deep breathing to prevent atelectasis and promote lung expansion. Maintain the integrity of the chest tube sys- tem to facilitate air drainage from around the lung and promote lung expansion. Crepitus near the tube insertion site refl ects air leakage into tissue and a possible leak in the chest tube system. When an air leak is no longer evi-dent, the lung has healed itself and sealed off the injured area. If the chest drainage system is impaired and loses its seal, place the end of the chest tube in a container of sterile water. Encourage frequent position changes to prevent complications of immobility and pro-mote lung expansion and perfusion. Provide an analgesic as needed to reduce anxiety and encourage coughing and deep breathing.Comparing types of chest trauma (continued) Med-Surg_Chap09.indd 151 Med-Surg_Chap09.indd 2:50:33 PM 8/2/2011 2:50:33 PM152 Respiratory disorders Pneumothorax can result when a fractured rib or penetrating trauma perforates a lung Air escapes from the lung into the pleural cavity The lung can't fully expand, gas exchange is compromised, normal intrathoracic pressure is dis- turbed, and the lung may collapse With tension pneumothorax, trauma causes air to escape from the lung into the pleural cavity, where the air becomes trapped Pressure builds in the thoracic cavity, causing lung collapse The mediastinum shifts to the opposite side, compromising the other lung, and the vena cava becomes depressed, causing impaired venous return With cardiac tamponade, intrapericardial pressure increases, compressing the heart; cardiac output decreases, and cardiogenic shock occursSigns and symptoms Diagnosis and treatment Nursing care Rib fractures Pain on inspiration Pain and tenderness of injured area upon palpation Ineffective ventilation and reten- tion of secretions Signs of other injury such as soft- tissue injury Chest X-ray and ABG studies typi- cally are ordered. Analgesia is given to relieve pain. An epidural catheter may be inserted for administration of nar-cotic analgesia. A nerve block into the intercostal nerves above and below the frac-tured ribs may be used to relieve severe pain. Tell the patient not to wear tight or constrictive clothing, which can inhibit lung expansion and decrease effective ventilation. Encourage the patient to breathe deeply and use an incentive spirometer hourly to maximize lung expansion and reexpand col-lapsed alveoli. Medicate for pain or discomfort as needed, which will allow the patient to deep-breathe effectively. Implement chest physiotherapy, unless contraindicated, to loosen secretions, which makes them easier to expectorate. Provide adequate hydration to liquefy secretions; thin secretions are easier to cough up. Tension pneumothorax Asymmetrical lung expansion and tracheal deviation to affected side Cyanosis, hypotension, and tachy- cardia Decreased or absent breath sounds on the affected side Distended neck veins Severe chest pain and respiratory distress Subcutaneous emphysema Chest X-ray and ABG studies typi- cally are ordered. Needle decompression is used for emergency air removal. A chest tube may be inserted and attached to a suction device, such as a three-chamber device. Administer oxygen to improve Pao2, reverse hypoxemia, and promote lung expan-sion. Teach the patient techniques for effective coughing and deep breathing to prevent atelectasis and promote lung expansion. Maintain the integrity of the chest tube system to facilitate air drainage from around the lung and promote lung expansion, as in pneumothorax. Encourage frequent position changes to prevent complications of immobility and pro-mote lung expansion and perfusion. Provide an analgesic as needed to reduce anxiety and encourage coughing and deep breathing.Comparing types of chest trauma (continued) Med-Surg_Chap09.indd 152 Med-Surg_Chap09.indd 152 8/2/2011 2:50:33 PM 8/2/2011 2:50:33 PMChronic pulmonary disease 153 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease /H18546Description COPD is the term used for preventable and treatable disorders that block the normal fl ow of air through the lungs, thereby trapping air in the alveoli Chronic bronchitis, and emphysema are types of COPD; asthma, once classi ed as a type of COPD, is now considered a distinct restrictive rather than obstructive disorder (see Comparing chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases ) /H18546Chronic bronchitis Chronic bronchitis affects the lung parenchyma; it's characterized by a productive cough for at least 3 months a year for 2 or more consecutive years It results from lung irritants, such as air pollution and smoking, as well as from genetic factors With chronic bronchitis, increased bronchial mucus gland production ciliary damage and epithelial metaplasia may bronchospasm, impaired clear- ance, expiration), increased secretions, and small-airway blockage Impaired diffusion is caused by decreased ow, mucus plugs, and secondary infection; cyanosis and polycythemia develop as a result of hypoxemia Signs and symptoms Diagnosis and treatments Nursing care Chronic bronchitis Accessory muscle use, slight increase in anteroposterior chest diameter Anxiety and depression Bronchospasm Chronic productive cough for thick, tenacious sputum that isn't clear and may have mucus plugs Cyanosis and dyspnea Decreased activity tolerance Heart failure, hyponatremia, and renal failure caused by fl uid overload late in disease Lung hyperresonance, decreased breath sounds, diffuse wheezes, crackles and rhonchi, and prolonged expiration Signs of right-sided heart fail- ure (cor pulmonale) Chest X-ray, pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gas (ABG) stud-ies, complete blood count, elec-trolyte levels, electrocardiogram, and sputum analysis typically are ordered. An inhaled anticholinergic and an inhaled beta2-adrenergic ago- nist are inhaler (MDI) or the airways. Aminophylline or another meth- ylxanthine is given orally or I.V. to relax bronchial spasms. An antibiotic is used to prevent or treat infection. An inhaled or oral steroid is used to decrease the infl ammatory response, thus decreasing bron-chial edema during acute exacer-bations. Administer oxygen to maintain a partial pres- sure of arterial oxygen (Pa O2) of 60 mm Hg or an arterial oxygen saturation of 90%. Provide adequate hydration to liquefy secre- tions. Thin secretions are easier to expectorate. Implement chest physical therapy. Postural drainage uses gravity to clear secretions; percus-sion and vibration loosen secretions, making them easier to cough up. Teach the patient how to cough effectively to help clear secretions and to use diaphragmatic and pursed-lip breathing. Teach the patient how to use an MDI with spacer correctly to ensure delivery of accurate doses to the small airways and to prevent overuse. Educate the patient about the signs of respi- ratory tract infections, such as fever, change in sputum color or amount, and increased shortness of breath. Untreated infections may lead to acute respiratory failure. Teach about proper and safe use of home oxy- gen equipment. Teach the patient about the effects of smoking, and help the patient quit. Recommend yearly infl uenza vaccines and pneumococcal vaccines every 5 years to reduce the risk of these infections.Comparing chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases Chronic bronchitis and emphysema have distinctive signs and symptoms and require speci c treatments and nursing care.

The patient is immunized against the fl u to prevent infection. If infection occurs, an antibiotic is the treatment of choice. Smoking cessation is encour- aged to prevent continued alveolar damage. See \" Chronic bronchitis: Diagno- sis and treatments, \" page 153, for speci c therapies. Administer oxygen to a hypoxemic patient to maintain a Pa O2 of 60 mm Hg. Be aware that exces- sive oxygenation may cause loss of the incentive to breathe. Teach about pursed-lip and abdominal breath- ing, which prevent small-airway collapse during exhalation by slowing respiration and increasing bronchiole pressure. Encourage activity to help prevent muscle wasting, but schedule frequent rest periods to avoid tiring the patient. Teach the patient to conserve energy by sitting for activities when possible and alternating hard and easy tasks. Teach relaxation and stress-reduction tech- niques to prevent anxiety, which can exacerbate the disease. Provide information about prescribed drugs. Explain the importance of adequate fl uid intake, which lique es secretions, and a balanced diet, which prevents muscle wasting. Instruct the patient to eat frequent small meals to prevent constipation and to avoid gas-forming foods to prevent pressure on the diaphragm and increased shortness of breath. Help prevent infections by telling the patient to avoid crowds, small children, and exposure to persons with respiratory tract infections. Teach the patient about the symptoms of respi- ratory tract infections. Untreated infections can lead to acute respiratory failure. Teach the patient about the effects of smoking, and help the patient quit. Recommend yearly infl uenza vaccines and a pneumococcal vaccine every 5 years. Arrange for home oxygen therapy if needed.Comparing chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (continued) Med-Surg_Chap09.indd and dilation of the right ventricle secondary to disease affect the structure or function of the lungs or their vasculature, resulting in right-sided heart failure The disorder can occur at the end stage of various chronic disorders of the lungs, pulmonary vessels, chest wall, and respiratory control center Pulmonary hypertension increases the heart's workload To compensate, the right ventricle hypertrophies to force blood through the lungs In response to hypoxia, the bone marrow produces more red blood cells, causing polycythemia; the resulting increased viscosity further aggravates pulmonary hypertension and increases right ventricu-lar workload Causes include primary pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary embolism, asthma, connective tissue disorders, COPD (the cause in more than half of all cases), chronic severe tricuspid regurgitation, disor-ders affecting the pulmonary parenchyma, and neuromuscular disease Cor pulmonale accounts for approximately 6% to 8% of all types of heart disease in adults in the United States Patients with cor pulmonale are typically older than age 45;

although it isn't a disease itself, it occurs secondary to other disease states Empyema is the accumulation of pus and necrotic tissue in the pleural space; blood (hemothorax) and chyle (chylothorax) may also collect in this space A pleural effusion can be classi ed either as exudative (caused by infl ammation of the pleura) or transudative (caused by excessive hydrostatic pressure or decreased osmotic pressure) Common causes of exudative effusions are bacterial or fungal empyema or pneumonitis, disease, malignancy, myxedema, pancreatitis, pulmonary embolism, subphrenic abscess, and tuberculosis Common causes heart failure, hepatic disease with ascites, hypoalbu- minemia, and peritoneal dialysis /H18546Signs and symptoms The most common symptoms are pleuritic pain and dyspnea Physical examination may reveal decreased chest wall movement, decreased breath sounds over the affected area, and dullness on percussion Infection from empyema may produce cough, fever, and night sweats /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Chest X-ray can diagnose pleural effusion; other tests that may be prescribed include CT scan of the chest, bronchoscopy, pleurocentesis, and ultrasonography The underlying cause should be treated if it can be identi ed Thoracentesis is performed to remove fl uid; chest tubes may be placed for continued drainage Thoracotomy may be needed if thoracentesis isn't effective An antibiotic is prescribed to treat empyema; the speci c antibiotic used depends on the causative organism /H18546Nursing interventions Explain thoracentesis to the patient, and support him during the procedure Watch for respiratory distress or pneumothorax after thoracentesis disorders Administer oxygen to improve oxygenation Encourage deep-breathing exercises and incentive spirometry to promote lung expansion Maintain the integrity of the chest tube drainage system; monitor the amount, color, and consistency of drainage; and check for air leaks Pneumonia /H18546Description Pneumonia is an acute lung infection with infl ammation accompanied by accumulation of exudate in the alveoli (see Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia ) The risk of pneumonia increases with aspiration, central nervous system depression, chronic illness, COPD, dehydration, existence of a tracheostomy opening, immobility, immunosuppression, intubation, pain in the thoracic cavity, and use of general anesthesia It may result from a bacterial, fungal, or viral infection or from exposure to a chemical irritant, through aspiration or gas inhalation Pneumonia remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality among elderly and chronically ill people /H18546Signs and symptoms Dyspnea or tachypnea, fatigue, and fever commonly occur Signs of cyanosis or hypoxia may occur in those with advanced disease Irritability or restlessness may signal cerebral hypoxia Sputum may vary in amount, color, and consistency, depending on the causative agent Lung auscultation may reveal crackles, rhonchi, bronchial breath sounds over areas of consolidation, or wheezes over the affected areas; breath sounds may be decreased in those with advanced disease /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Chest X-ray, ABG studies, sputum culture (for bacterial infection), and serologic testing (for viral infection) may be prescribed Needle or open biopsy may obtain lung tissue specimens (for fungal infection), and cold agglutinins may reveal antibodies associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection Pneumonia is treated with antibiotics to eradicate the infecting organism A bronchodilator is used to open narrowed airways /H18546Nursing interventions Teach effective coughing and deep breathing to improve airway clearance Provide adequate hydration to liquefy secretions;

anxiety can compromise the immune system and increase the risk of infection Pulmonary edema /H18546Description Pulmonary edema is the collection of fl uid in the interstitium and alveoli of the lungs as pressure rises in the pulmonary vessels It can result from ARDS, fl uid overload, left-sided heart failure, mitral stenosis, MI, pulmonary emboli With pulmonary edema, the left ventricle can't effectively pump blood from the heart With increased resistence to left ventricular lling, fl uid backs up into 8/2/2011 2:50:33 PM 159 Surface tension increases, the alveoli shrink, and the lungs become stiff, making breathing more dif cult Hypoxemia and an altered V /Q ratio develop Fluid moves into the larger airways, where it's coughed up as pink, frothy sputum /H18546Signs and symptoms Tachycardia and tachypnea may be accompanied by narrowed pulse pressures and hypotension; third and fourth heart sounds may be present; skin may be cold and clammy Dyspnea, increased respiratory rate, orthopnea, and pulmonary hypertension may occur Jugular veins may be distended, and PAWP may be elevated Coughing may produce blood-tinged or pink, frothy sputum Lung auscultation may reveal dependent crackles Other signs and symptoms may include confusion, decreased urine output, diaphoresis, drowsiness, lethargy, and restlessness /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Chest X-ray, pulse oximetry, and ABG studies typically are prescribed A PA catheter is inserted to measure pressures A diuretic is administered to decrease edema Other drugs that may be administered include an inotropic drug to increase myocardial contractility, nitroglycerin preload and afterload, and a vasopressor to maintain blood pressure Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary to treat respiratory distress Morphine is administered to decrease preload, respiratory rate, and anxiety Patients who don't respond to drug therapy may be treated with an intra-aortic balloon pump, which temporarily assists the failed left ventricle, or with surgery (such as angioplasty, coronary artery bypass grafting, or valvular repair), depending on the underlying heart condition /H18546Nursing interventions Administer oxygen to aid ventilation, improve Pa o2, and reverse hypoxemia Place the patient in semi-Fowler's position to maximize oxygenation and increase comfort Carefully monitor fl uid intake and output to assess the effectiveness of diuretic therapy and prevent sudden increases in venous return caused by oral and I.V. intake Medicate for pain as needed to reduce anxiety and increase comfort Frequently change the patient's position to prevent pressure ulcers and encourage lung expansion Pulmonary embolism /H18546Description Pulmonary embolism is a blockage in the pulmonary vasculature Risk factors include atrial brillation; COPD; a family history traceptive use; prior thromboembolic disease; by abdominal, pelvic, or thoracic Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia commonly results from an infection of P . jiroveci in an immun ocompromised patient. Its onset is abrupt and may be a fl are-up of a latent dis- ease. Its signs and symptoms may include crackles over the affected areas, cyanosis, dyspnea or tachypnea, fever, hypoxemia, irritability or restlessness, and nonproductive cough. Diagnostic tests may include chest X-ray, arterial blood gas analysis to check for hypoxemia, and needle or open biopsy to obtain lung tissue specimens for culture. The drugs of choice for treating this type of pneumonia are pentami- dine isethionate, an inhaled antibiotic, and co- trimoxazole (also known as sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim). Care for a patient with P . jiroveci pneumonia resembles that of a patient with other types of pneumonia. Key nurs-ing interventions include administering oxygen and an anal-gesic as needed, practicing good hand hygiene throughout care, limiting activity and encouraging rest periods, and teaching techniques to reduce the spread of infection and reduce stress.Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia PM160 or leg or pelvic trauma; and venous stasis caused by age (older than age 55), burns, obesity, pregnancy, or prolonged immobility Pulmonary embolism is commonly caused by dislodged thrombi from deep veins in the pelvis or legs or from any systemic veins In this disorder, an embolism lodges in a branch of the pulmonary vasculature; the embolism may consist of bone, air, fat, amniotic fl uid, a thrombus, or a foreign object The area of the lung below the embolism isn't perfused, causing altered V\u00b7/Q\u00b7 ratio, which can cause alveolar collapse and lead to atelectasis and hypoxemia Pulmonary infarction may occur, destroying lung tissue A massive pulmonary embolism can cause pulmonary hypertension as a result of increased vas- cular resistance, right-sided heart failure as a result of increased right ventricular workload, or ven-tricular hypertrophy as a result of increased right ventricular workload /H18546Signs and symptoms Dyspnea may occur suddenly, accompanied by chest pain Pleuritic chest pain may indicate pulmonary infarction Cough may produce hemoptysis Anxiety, increased restlessness, hypotension, and tachycardia may occur Lung auscultation may reveal crackles, pleural friction rub, and wheezes Low-grade fever and tachypnea may occur Signs of cor pulmonale and right-sided heart failure may develop If the patient has a massive pulmonary embolism, he may experience arrhythmias, cyanosis, or diaphoresis If the patient has a fat embolism, he may experience confusion, dyspnea, or petechiae on his chest and axillae The patient's legs may have signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis, such as edema, redness, tenderness, and warmth /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Several tests are used to diagnose pulmonary embolism: ABG studies, chest X-ray, electrocardiogra- phy, lung scintigraphy, MRI, pulmonary angiography, and V\u00b7/Q\u00b7 lung scanning Several tests are used to diagnose deep vein thrombosis, which can lead to pulmonary embolism: contrast venography, Doppler ultrasonography, impedance plethysmography, and leg brinogen After an initial I.V. bolus of heparin, a therapeutic heparin infusion is given to inhibit clot formation, prevent emboli development, and maintain the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) between 1.5 and 2 times the control (60 to 70 seconds) If the patient needs long-term therapy, warfarin (Coumadin) is administered to maintain the pro- thrombin time (PT) between 1.5 and 2 times the control (11 to 12 seconds) or the International Nor-malized Ratio (INR) between 2 and 3; once the therapeutic dose of warfarin is achieved, the heparin infusion may be discontinued If the patient has a life-threatening embolism, a thrombolytic is administered, or a surgical embolec- tomy is performed If the patient can't tolerate anticoagulant therapy or continues to develop clots despite taking these drugs, surgical insertion of a vena caval lter may be needed A diuretic may be prescribed for a patient with a fat embolism; an antibiotic, for a patient with a septic embolism An antiarrhythmic may be used to correct heart rhythm disturbances caused by ischemia /H18546Nursing interventions Administer oxygen to improve Pa o2, reverse hypoxemia, and promote lung expansion If the patient requires mechanical ventilation, assist as needed Teach effective coughing and deep breathing to help clear secretions and prevent atelectasis Provide adequate hydration to liquefy secretions; thin secretions are easier to expectorate Encourage early ambulation to prevent clot formation in deep veins; encourage range-of-motion (ROM) exercises or perform passive ROM exercises if the patient can't walk Med-Surg_Chap09.indd 160 Med-Surg_Chap09.indd PMTuberculosis 161 Use antiembolism stockings or a compression device to divert blood fl ow to the large veins, prevent emboli formation, and promote venous return Don't raise the patient's knees; this obstructs venous fl ow and increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis Elevate the patient's legs to prevent venous stasis Maintain the heparin infusion, and monitor the PTT Administer warfarin daily, as prescribed, and monitor the PT or INR Test all stool for blood caused by anticoagulant-induced GI bleeding Provide analgesia and comfort measures to reduce anxiety Teach the patient about anticoagulant therapy to reduce the risk of bleeding, and help the patient maintain therapeutic PT or INR Have the family or home health nurse check the home for hazards, especially those that may cause falls; a safe environment is necessary because a patient receiving an anticoagulant has an increased tendency to bleed Instruct the patient not to cross his legs, sit for long periods, or wear restrictive clothing; these a ctivities inhibit venous return and promote clot formation Severe acute respiratory syndrome /H18546Description Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a life-threatening viral infection believed to be coronavirus A theory suggests that coronavirus may have mutated from pigs, birds, and other animals, allowing transmission to and infection of humans The incubation period is estimated to range from 2 to 7 days (average is 3 to 5 days) Risk factors include close contact with an infected person, contact with exhaled droplets and bodily secretions from an infected person, or travel to endemic areas /H18546Signs and symptoms In early stages, signs and symptoms include nonproductive cough, rash, high fever, headache, body aches, and pneumonia Shortness of breath and respiratory distress occur in later stages /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Serum electrophoresis detects antibodies to the coronavirus Sputum Gram stain and culture isolates the coronavirus SARS-speci c polymerase chain reaction tests detect SARS-CoV RNA Isolation (strict respiratory and mucosal barrier) prevents the spread of disease Antivirals treat viral infection, and a combination of corticosteroids and antimicrobials treat infl am- mation and infection Mechanical ventilation treats respiratory failure /H18546Nursing interventions Maintain isolation for the patient Practice good hygiene to prevent further transmission Maintain a patent airway through suctioning if the patient requires mechanical ventilation Monitor the patient's vital signs and nutritional, fl uid, and respiratory status Tuberculosis /H18546Description Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that commonly affects the lungs; it typically occurs only after repeated, close contact with a person infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis Risk factors for TB include alcoholism, immunosuppression, low economic status, and malnutrition; elderly people, populations in crowded areas (for example, shelters and prisons), and immigrants from areas with high incidences of TB (such as Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Caribbean islands) are also more susceptible The incidence of TB has increased in proportion to the increase in patients who are infected with the human immunode ciency virus 2:50:33 PM162 Respiratory disorders M. tuberculosis is spread by way of infected airborne droplets; after infected droplets are inhaled into the terminal bronchioles, localized pneumonia develops, initiating an infl ammatory response Bacilli are phagocytized by macrophages but remain viable within the phagocyte Tubercles form and grow in the lungs The lesion center forms a yellow, cheesy mass called caseous necrosis Healing begins, walling off the initial infection, and adenopathy occurs Systemic infection may develop in the absence of appropriate treatment Within 6 weeks of exposure to the infected droplets, cellular immunity occurs, and skin test results become positive Latent TB infection can become active TB disease years after exposure, when resistance is lowered /H18546Signs and symptoms Anorexia, weight loss, chills, fever, chest pain, coughing up blood or sputum, and night sweats may occur in patients with active TB disease Lung ausculation may reveal crackles, /H18546Diagnosis test or the Quanti FERON - TB Gold test, a gamma interferon blood test for TB, can be used to test for M. tuberculosis infection Abnormalities seen during a chest X-ray may suggest TB, but can't be used to diagnose TB The presence of acid-fast bacilli on a sputum smear or other specimen after indicates disease A positive culture for M. tuberculosis con rms the diagnosis of active TB disease Preventive treatment with isoniazid for 9 to 12 months is recommended for other members of the patient's household, those with recently converted positive skin tests, and those with positive skin tests (depending on medical history) If the patient has active TB disease, an antituberculotic is used for 6 to 9 months; isoniazid with rifampin usually is the rst choice; other antituberculotics include ethambutol, and pyrazinamide /H18546Nursing interventions Teach the patient how to contain airborne droplets and secretions to reduce the risk of spreading the infection Practice good hand hygiene techniques to reduce the risk of spreading the infection Explain disease transmission to the patient and the need for prolonged therapy to help increase his compliance with the treatment plan Teach the patient about the prescribed drugs, including how to recognize adverse reactions (especially the symptoms of hepatotoxicity) Encourage the patient to maintain adequate dietary intake to maintain nutritional status, build strength, and improve the body's defense mechanisms Weigh the patient daily to assess nutritional status Review questions 1. A patient with pneumonia in the right lower lobe is prescribed percussion and postural drainage. When performing percussion and postural drainage, the nurse should position him: /H18540A. in semi-Fowler's position with his knees bent. /H18540B. in a right side-lying position with the foot of his bed elevated. /H18540C. in a prone or supine position with the foot of his bed elevated higher than his head. /H18540D. bent at the waist leaning slightly forward. Correct answer: C The aim of percussion and postural drainage is to mobilize pulmonary secretions, so they can be effectively expectorated. When a patient has pneumonia in the right lower lobe, the nurse should position him with his right side up or lower lobes elevated above the upper lobes so that gravity can help mobilize pulmonary secretions. Options A and D are incorrect because semi-Fowler's position and being bent forward at the waist would hamper mobilization of secretions from the right lower lobe. Option B is incorrect because the patient should be positioned with his right side up. Med-Surg_Chap09.indd 162 Med-Surg_Chap09.indd 162 8/2/2011 2:50:33 PM 8/2/2011 2:50:33 163 2. A patient with acquired immunode ciency syndrome (AIDS) develops P. jiroveci pneumonia. Which nursing diagnosis has the highest priority for this patient? /H18540A. Impaired gas exchange /H18540B. Impaired oral Imbalanced nutrition: Less than body requirements /H18540D. Activity intolerance Correct answer: A Although all these nursing diagnoses are appropriate for a patient with AIDS, Impaired gas exchange is the priority nursing diagnosis for the patient with P. jiroveci pneumonia. Airway, breathing, and circulation take top priority for any patient. 3. A patient has chronic bronchitis. The nurse is teaching him breathing exercises. Which point should the nurse include in her teaching? /H18540A. Make inhalation longer than exhalation. /H18540B. open mouth. /H18540C. Use diaphragmatic breathing. /H18540D. Use chest breathing. Correct answer: C In patients with chronic bronchitis, the diaphragm is fl at and weak. Diaphragmatic breathing helps to strengthen the diaphragm and maximizes ventilation. Option A is incorrect because exhalation should be no longer than inhalation to prevent collapse of the bronchioles. Because a patient with chronic bronchitis should exhale through pursed lips to prolong expiration, keep the bronchioles from collapsing, and prevent air trapping, Option B is incorrect. Option D is incorrect because diaphrag-matic breathing, not chest breathing, increases lung expansion. 4. A patient with ARDS is intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. His Pa o2 is 60 mm Hg on 1.0 F io2. To improve his Pa o2 without raising the F io2, the patient will most likely be placed on: /H18540A. time-cycled ventilation. /H18540B. volume-cycled ventilation. /H18540C. pressure support. /H18540D. PEEP. Correct answer: D PEEP is widely used during mechanical ventilation of the patient with ARDS to improve gas exchange over the alveolar capillary membrane. Time- or volume-cycled ventilation, Options A and B, are less likely to be used for a patient with ARDS than pressure-cycled ventilation. Pressure support, Option C, depends on the patient's inspiratory effort and isn't as effective as PEEP in treating ARDS. 5. When auscultating the chest of a patient with pneumonia, the nurse should expect to hear which type of sounds over areas of consolidation? reveals bronchial breath sounds over areas of consolidation. Bronchovesicular breath sounds (Option B) are normal over midlobe lung regions, tubular sounds (Option C) are commonly heard over large airways, and vesicular breath sounds (Option D) are commonly heard in the bases of the lung elds. Med-Surg_Chap09.indd 163 Med-Surg_Chap09.indd 163 8/2/2011 Respiratory disorders 6. A patient's history reveals that he suffers from daytime symptoms of asthma that occur 3 to 6 days a week. How would his asthma severity be described? /H18540A. Mild intermittent /H18540B. Mild persistent /H18540C. Moderate persistent /H18540D. Severe persistent Correct answer: B In mild persistent asthma, the patient's daytime symptoms of asthma occur 3 to 6 days a week. In mild intermittent asthma (Option A), the patient's daytime symptoms occur no more than twice a week. In moderate persistent asthma (Option C), the patient has daily daytime symptoms. In severe persistent asthma (Option D), the patient has continual daytime symptoms. 7. A 66-year-old patient has marked dyspnea at rest, is thin, and uses accessory muscles to breathe. He is tachypneic, with a prolonged expiratory phase. He has no cough. He leans forward with his arms braced on his knees to support his chest and shoulders for breathing. This patient has signs and symptoms of which respira-tory disorder? Correct answer: D These are classic signs and symptoms of a patient with emphysema. Patients with ARDS (Option A) are acutely short of breath and require emergency care; those with asthma (option B) are also acutely short of breath during an attack and appear very frightened. Patients with chronic obstructive bronchitis (Option C) appear bloated and cyanotic. 8. A nurse is preparing to reinforce the teaching plan for a patient who has recently been diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the left lung. Which statement by the nurse is correct? /H18540A. \"You have a slow-growing cancer that rarely spreads.\" /H18540B. \"In terms of prognosis, you may have only a few months to live.\" /H18540C. \"Squamous cell cancer is a very rapidly growing cancer.\" /H18540D. \"The cancer has generally metastasized by the time diagnosis is made.\" Correct answer: A Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that grows slowly and rarely metasta- sizes. It has the best prognosis of all lung cancer types. It's not appropriate for the nurse to tell the patient how long he has to live (Option B). Squamous cell carcinoma does not grow rapidly (Option C) and rarely metastasizes (Option D). 9. Which respiratory disorder is most common in the rst 24 to 48 hours after surgery? Atelectasis develops when there's interference with the normal negative pressure that promotes lung expansion. Patients in the postoperative phase often splint their breathing because of pain and positioning, which causes hypoxia. It's uncommon for any of the other respiratory disorders (Options B, C, and D) to develop. Med-Surg_Chap09.indd 164 Med-Surg_Chap09.indd 164 8/2/2011 2:50:33 PM 8/2/2011 2:50:33 acute asthma showing inspiratory and expiratory wheezes and a decreased forced expira- tory volume should be treated immediately with which class of medication? /H18540A. Beta-adrenergic blockers Correct answer: B Bronchodilators are the rst line of treatment for asthma because bronchoconstric- tion is the cause of reduced airfl ow. (Option A), which can cause bronchocon- striction, aren't used to treat asthma. Inhaled or oral steroids (Options C and D) may be given to reduce the infl ammation but aren't used for emergency relief.Review disorders 10 Introduction /H18546The nervous system is the communications center of the body /H18546It coordinates all sensory and motor activities essential to proper physiologic functioning; it also plays a signi cant role in maintaining homeostasis /H18546Nursing history The nurse asks the patient about his chief complaint The most common complaints concerning the neurologic system include changes in level of con- sciousness (LOC), confusion, memory loss, dizziness, faintness, headache, numbness and tingling in extremities, seizures, weakness, and dif culty walking or moving The patient may also report a change in balance or gait The nurse then questions the patient about his present illness Ask the patient about his symptom, including when it started, associated signs and symptoms, location, radiation, intensity, duration, frequency, and precipitating and alleviating factors Ask the patient about any dizziness, numbness, paralysis, seizures, tingling, tremors, or weakness Question him about problems with any of his senses or with keeping his balance, swallowing, uri- nating, or walking Ask about headaches and photophobia Ask the patient how he rates his memory and ability to concentrate Question him about trouble speaking or understanding people Ask about dif culties reading or writing The nurse asks about medical history Question the patient about other neurologic disorders Ask about chronic diseases, major illnesses, accidents, injuries, surgeries, and allergies The nurse then assesses the family history Ask about a family history of neurologic diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cerebro- vascular accident (stroke), migraines, and seizures Question the patient about a family history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and hypertension The nurse obtains a social history Ask about work, exercise, diet, use of recreational drugs, alcohol, and hobbies Also ask about stress, support systems, and coping mechanisms /H18546Physical assessment The nurse assesses neurologic function in these ve areas: mental status and speech, cranial nerve function, sensory function, motor function, and refl exes The nurse assesses mental status and speech Note the patient's appearance, mannerisms, posture, facial expression, grooming, emotions, speech, and tone of voice Check for orientation to person, place, and time and for memory of recent and past events To test intellect, ask the patient to count backward from 100 by 7s, to read aloud, or to interpret a common proverb, and see how well he understands and follows commands Describe the patient's response to verbal, motor, and sensory stimuli; use the Glasgow Coma Scale for a standardized assessment Med-Surg_Chap10.indd 166 Med-Surg_Chap10.indd 166 8/2/2011 2:53:04 167 The nurse assesses cranial nerve function Assess each of the 12 pairs of cranial nerves Note whether the patient has motor or sensory de cits, or both The nurse assesses sensory function Assess the patient for sensation to super cial pain, light touch, vibration, position, and discrimination Compare the patient's responses bilaterally The nurse assesses motor function To test cerebellar function, inspect muscle size, contour, and symmetry, observing the patient for abnormal movements, such as tics, tremors, and fasciculations; note coordination, gait, and balance Assess the patient's muscle tone and strength Compare assessment ndings bilaterally The nurse assesses refl exes Test ndings bilaterally Alzheimer's disease /H18546Description Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, degenerative disorder of the cerebral cortex; it's irreversible It's associated with brain cell atrophy, decreased levels of acetylcholine, enlarged ventricles, neuritic plaques in brain tissue, and neuro brillar tangles The exact cause is unknown; it may be caused by abnormal protein in the brain, environmental tox- ins, genetic factors (e.g., a variant of apolipoprotein E), and inadequate cerebral blood fl ow /H18546Signs and symptoms Altered behavior and memory may include recent memory loss and impaired judgment (see Stages of Alzheimer's disease ) Muscle rigidity, myoclonic jerks, and restlessness may occur Obsessive behaviors may develop The patient may develop anomia (inability to remember one's name) and aphasia (impaired ability to communicate verbally or in writing due to brain center dysfunctions) During the nal stages, the patient loses almost all mental abilities, including self-care skills, speech, and voluntary movement /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Alzheimer's disease typically is diagnosed when other dementia-producing conditions have been ruled out A de nitive diagnosis can be made only if neuritic plaques and neuro brillar tangles are found in the brain during a postmortem examination Stages of Alzheimer's disease Early stage Intermediate stage End stage Recent memory loss Inability to learn and retain new information Dif culty nding words Personality changes and mood swings Progressive dif culty performing activities of daily living Inability to learn and recall new information Reduced ability to remember past events Increased need for assistance with activities of daily living Wandering Agitation, hostility, or physical aggressiveness Lack of orientation to time and place Bladder and bowel incontinence Inability to walk Total incontinence No recent or remote memory Inability to swallow and eat No intelligible speech Med-Surg_Chap10.indd PM168 Neurologic disorders Treatment calls for supportive measures, such as relieving speci c symptoms, providing for patient safety, and providing emotional support to the patient and family The anticholinergics donepezil (Aricept) and tacrine (Cognex) may improve memory in the early stages of the disease /H18546Nursing interventions Make sure the patient carries identi cation, such as an ID card or bracelet, so that if he wanders off, he can be brought home Speak in calm, friendly tones; even if the patient can't understand the content of what's being said, he can perceive emotional undertones Give simple instructions; the patient may become frustrated trying to follow complicated directions Plan a full schedule of daily activities, especially music therapy and stretching to music, to facilitate sleep at night and provide diversion from an otherwise monotonous day Provide a quiet, calm environment. Most Alzheimer's patients can't tolerate overstimulation, includ- ing bright colors and noises Maintain the patient's nutritional status; the patient may not eat unless reminded to do so, may not be able to use utensils, and may need help preparing food and eating Assist the patient with dressing and toileting Give the patient and family information about Alzheimer's disease; refer family members to a local support group to enhance their ability to cope Provide a safe environment for the patient, and discuss with the family the possible need for a home care aide; the patient may lack the judgment to drive safely, use appliances, or manage personal nances As soon as a diagnosis is made, discuss the possibility of power of attorney with the patient and family Provide emotional support and affection; the family may be so exhausted and frustrated that they can't display affection toward the patient Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis /H18546Description Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)\u2014also known as Lou Gehrig disease\u2014is a chronic, rapidly pro- gressive, and debilitating neurologic disease that's incurable and invariably fatal In ALS, motor neurons located in the anterior horns of the spinal column degenerate and the muscles they serve begin to atrophy The disease is characterized by weakness that begins in the upper extremities; it progressively involves the neck and throat, eventually leading to disability, respiratory failure, and death The exact cause is unknown, but factors associated with ALS include an autoimmune mechanism, viral infection, autosomal-dominant inheritance, and metabolic interference in nucleic acid production by the nerve bers Factors that precipitate acute deterioration include stress, trauma, infections, and exhaustion The disease affects more men than women Complications include respiratory infections and (ultimately) respiratory failure, complications of immobility, and aspiration /H18546Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms include twitching and involuntary movements accompanied by atrophy and weakness in the muscles of the forearms, hands, legs, and trunk Focal wasting of muscle groups also occurs The patient may have slurred speech, dif culty chewing and swallowing, and drooling Other symptoms include dyspnea and shortness of breath /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Levels of glutamate in cerebrospinal fl uid (CSF) and serum are increased Electromyography and muscle biopsy may help diagnosis ALS Treatment is supportive and aims to prevent complications; rehabilitative measures include occupa- tional, physical, and PM 8/2/2011 2:53:05 PMArteriovenous malformations 169 High treatment priorities include airway protection and preventing aspiration and respiratory infec- tions; patients may ultimately need mechanical ventilation Muscle relaxants, mucolytics, antidepressants, and anxiolytics may be used Riluzole, a glutamate antagonist, may help slow disease progression /H18546Nursing interventions Implement a rehabilitation program that helps the patient maintain as much independence as he can for as long as possible Help obtain supportive equipment, such as a walker or wheelchair, as needed Prevent complications of immobility; help the patient change position frequently and perform active range-of-motion (ROM) activities Monitor the patient's respiratory status, and provide supplemental oxygen as needed Initiate a diet of easy-to-swallow soft foods, and monitor for potential aspiration Provide supportive care to both the patient and family, and teach them about the disease process and treatment options Arteriovenous malformations /H18546Description Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are tangled masses of thin-walled, dilated blood vessels that form abnormal connections between arteries and veins; AVMs range in size from a few millimeters to large malformations that extend from the cerebral cortex to the ventricles; typically, more than one AVM is present AVMs are primarily located in the posterior portion of the cerebral hemispheres Most AVMs result from congenital defects in capillary development; traumatic injury may also be a cause Most AVMs are present at birth; however, symptoms typically don't occur until young adulthood Typically, high-pressured arterial fl ow moves into the venous system chan- nels to increase venous pressure, engorging and dilating the venous structures If the AVM is large enough, the shunting can deprive the surrounding tissue of adequate blood fl ow Thin-walled vessels may develop aneurysms and ooze small amounts of blood or actually rupture, causing hemorrhage into the brain or subarachnoid space /H18546Signs and symptoms AVMs can cause persistent headaches unresponsive to treatment Other signs and symptoms include changes in mental status and intellectual acuity, dizziness, and visual disturbances Seizures and neurologic de cits may also occur /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Cerebral arteriography con rms the presence of AVMs and evaluates blood fl ow Doppler ultrasonography of the blood fl ow Computed tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can help differentiate an AVM from a clot or tumor EEG can help localize the AVM Treatment depends on the size and location of the AVM, the feeder vessels supplying it, and the patient's condition Treatments include embolization, proton-beam radioablation, laser surgery, and surgical excision /H18546Nursing interventions Provide supportive measures, including aneurysm precautions (placing the patient on bed rest or with limited activity, maintaining a quiet atmosphere, and keeping the patient calm [with sedatives, if needed]) to prevent possible rupture Institute seizure precautions, and monitor for signs of increased intracranial pressure Prepare for surgery, and administer I.V. fl uids and medications as ordered Postoperatively, control hypertension, monitor the patient's neurologic status, and provide pain relief Teach the patient and family about the disorder, including the signs and symptoms of complications If the patient develops de cits from the AVM, provide for adaptive measures acute infl ammation of the brain In this disorder, intense lymphocytic in ltration of brain tissues and the leptomeninges results in cerebral edema, degeneration of the brain's ganglion cells, and diffuse nerve cell destruction (gray more than white matter) Causes include adenoviruses, enteroviruses in urban areas (such as measles and amebic infection Determining the true incidence of encephalitis is dif cult because reporting policies vary Males and females appear to be affected equally; the very young and very old are at highest risk Some seasonal variation occurs, with arborviruses typically occurring in spring and summer, entero- viruses peaking in later summer or early fall, and mumps and varicella occurring in spring Complications may include paralysis, epilepsy, mental deterioration, parkinsonism, and death /H18546Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms include fever, malaise, myalgias, headache, muscle stiffness, photophobia Altered LOC, confusion, seizures, and other signs of increased ICP can all occur Other signs and symptoms include nausea and vomiting, exaggerated deep tendon refl exes and absent super cial refl exes, paresis or paralysis of the extremities, and a positive Brudzinski's sign Certain anthropoid-borne viruses may cause a rash /H18546Diagnosis and treatment CSF may contain elevated white blood cell and protein levels and decreased glucose levels; the causative organism may also be cultured from CSF Antibodies to certain viruses may be present in serum MRI may demonstrate infl ammation in affected areas in the brain EEG shows changes in encephalitis Treatment focuses on correcting the underlying cause and preventing injury from increased ICP /H18546Nursing interventions Monitor for signs of increasing ICP to allow for early control and management Administer nonopioid analgesics, and provide a quiet, nonstimulating environment Administer anti-infective agents as ordered, and watch for therapy-related complications Administer antipyretics and antiseizure medications as ordered Teach the patient and family about the disease process and treatment, and provide supportive care Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome /H18546Description Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome is an acute, rapidly progressing, and potentially fatal form of p olyneuritis In this syndrome, the body's autoimmune system attacks peripheral nerve myelin, resulting in rapid segmental demyelination of peripheral nerves and some cranial nerves; this produces ascending weak-ness with dyskinesias (inability to execute voluntary movements), hyporefl exia, and paresthesias A viral infection often precedes the clinical presentation Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome is the most common cause of acute fl accid paralysis in the United States; it most often affects males between the ages of 16 to 25 and 45 to 60 The syndrome has a mortality rate of about 5%; up to 75% of patients recover completely over the course of a few months to several years Complications include paralysis, permanent muscle weakness, contractures, muscle wasting, and respiratory and cardiac compromise /H18546Signs and symptoms Minor febrile illness (respiratory or diarrheal) may precede signs and symptoms of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 by 1 to 3 weeks Symptoms of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 include tingling and numbness (paresthesia) in the legs; symptom progress to the arms, trunk and, nally, the face Med-Surg_Chap10.indd 170 Med-Surg_Chap10.indd 170 8/2/2011 2:53:05 PM 8/2/2011 2:53:05 PMHead trauma 171 Other signs and symptoms include stiffness and pain in the legs and back; acute, symmetrical ascending weakness of the limbs; sensory loss, usually in the legs and spreading to the arms; dif culty talking, chewing, and swallowing; paralysis of the ocular, facial, and oropharyngeal muscles; loss of position sense; and diminished or absent deep tendon refl exes /H18546Diagnosis and treatment CSF shows elevated protein levels Evoked potential studies may show a progressive loss of nerve conduction velocity Because Guillain-Barr\u00e9 is a medical emergency, with rapid progression and neuromuscular respira- tory failure, treatment may include aggressive respiratory therapy and mechanical ventilation along with oxygen support Treatment includes supportive hemodynamic measures The patient may also require plasmapheresis /H18546Nursing interventions Monitor the patient's cardiac and respiratory status Administer oxygen as needed If possible, establish a means of communication before the patient requires intubation Monitor the patient's intake and output Take measures to prevent complications of immobility, such as deep vein thrombosis, pressure ulcer formation, and muscle wasting Provide adequate nutrition Provide supportive care to the patient and family Head trauma /H18546Description Head trauma, a term that encompasses several types of injuries, is the leading cause of disability Head trauma is a general term for injuries to the head, ranging from a minor concussion to life- threatening hematoma and herniation Primary injuries are directly caused by the trauma; secondary injuries are indirectly caused by the trauma (see Types of head injury, page 172) /H18546Signs and symptoms Depending on the severity and location of the injury, the patient will have varying neurologic de - cits, such as motor and sensory changes, pupillary changes, reduced LOC, and seizures If the patient has increased ICP, he may experience bradycardia, decerebrate or decorticate postur- ing, focal neurologic signs, headache, increased blood pressure, pupillary changes (including sluggish or absent response to light and unequal size), reduced LOC (including agitation, coma, confusion, leth-argy, and restlessness), seizures, vomiting, and widened pulse pressure If CSF leakage occurs, the patient may experience frequent swallowing, otorrhea, and rhinorrhea /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis may be based on skull X-ray, CT scan of the head and cervical spine, MRI, lumbar punc- ture, cerebral angiography, and EEG A cervical collar may be placed on the patient's neck until a cervical injury is ruled out Treatment depends on the severity of the injury For a concussion, neurologic function is monitored for 24 hours For a contusion, neurologic function is monitored in a controlled environment for possibly increased ICP For laceration, diagnostic procedures are implemented for early identi cation of secondary injuries Continuous ICP monitoring may be indicated If present, clots are removed surgically; hematomas may need to be evacuated; in the presence of hydrocephalus, a drain may be placed in the ventricles Supportive measures\u2014such as drug therapy for increased ICP (see Increased intracranial pressure , page 175), intubation and mechanical ventilation, invasive hemodynamic monitoring, and invasive ICP PM172 Neurologic disorders Injury Description Mechanisms Primary injuries Concussion Brief period of cerebral paralysis; full recov- ery usually occurs in 12 hours, but post-concussion syndrome (characterized by dif culty concentrating, fatigue, headache, and photophobia) sometimes occursSudden blow to the head that causes anterograde and retrograde brain injury Contusion Bruising of the brain; may be a coup injury (hemorrhage and edema under the injury site) or a contrecoup injury (hemorrhage and edema opposite from the injury site)Sudden impact, commonly resulting from acceleration-deceleration forces, that displaces cerebrospinal fl uid and causes the brain to hit the inside of the skull Laceration Tearing of the cortical surface High-velocity acceleration-decelera- tion injury or a penetrating trauma, such as a stab wound or gunshot wound Secondary injuries Cerebellar herniation Pushing of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnumForce that pushes the brain contents into another compartment, com-pressing the medulla Epidural hemorrhage or hematomaArterial bleeding between the dura and the skull;

To use the scale, test the patient's ability to respond to verbal, motor, and sensory stimulation and grade your ndings according to the scale. If a patient is alert, can follow simple commands, and is oriented to person, place, and time, his score will total 15 points, the highest possible score. A low score in one or more categories may signal an impending neurologic crisis. A total score of 7 or less indicates severe neurologic damage.Using the Glasgow Coma Scale Test Score Patient's response Eye opening response Spontaneously 4 Opens eyes spontaneously To speech 3 Opens eyes when told toTo pain 2 Opens eyes only on painful stimulusNever 1 Doesn't open eyes in response to stimulus Motor response Obeys commands 6 Shows two ngers when asked Localizes pain 5 Reaches toward painful stimulus and tries to remove itWithdraws 4 Moves away from painful stimulusAbnormal fl exion 3 Assumes a decorticate posture (in which the hands are toward the cord, shown below) Abnormal extension 2 Assumes a decerebrate posture (shown below) None 1 No response;

allow them time to verbalize their concerns and feelings, and assist with positive coping strategies Identify self-care de cits; assist with activities of daily living as necessary, and encourage the patient's participation as much as possible Encourage the patient to be independent Provide communication aids, speak slowly and clearly to the patient, allow time for the patient to respond, and ensure that the patient has understood what was said Provide assistance with ambulation; encourage the use of assistive devices, such as a cane or walker, as indicated If the patient is on bed rest, maintain a turning schedule, repositioning the patient at least every 2 hours; pad bony prominences, perform passive ROM exercises on the extremities to maintain joint function and mobility, and encourage the patient to participate as able Provide adequate nutrition and provide for increased calorie needs Elevate the head of the bed while the patient is eating to help prevent choking and aspiration Give medications as ordered Monitor the patient's mental status, and be alert for neurologic changes Increased intracranial pressure /H18546Description ICP is a measure of the pressure in the cranial cavity; 0 to 15 mm Hg is normal, 16 to 20 mm Hg is mildly elevated, 21 to 30 mm Hg is moderately elevated, and 31 mm Hg or more is severely elevated The adult skull has a xed volume of intracranial components, which consist of 80% brain tissue, 10% blood, and 10% CSF According to the Monro-Kellie doctrine, an increase in any of the three components must be offset by a decrease in the others If this balancing out doesn't occur, ICP increases Autoregulation adjusts cerebral blood fl ow and CSF production and reabsorption to maintain normal ICP; it can no longer maintain normal pressure when ICP exceeds 33 mm Hg or the mean arterial pres-sure (MAP) exceeds 160 mm Hg Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is the pressure at which the brain cells are perfused; CPP = MAP - ICP; CPP is normally 70 to 100 mm Hg Several factors may increase ICP: cerebral edema resulting from infection, intracranial or subarach- noid bleeding, or a metabolic bleeding; or vaso-genic cerebral edema caused by trauma /H18546Signs and symptoms An altered LOC is usually the earliest sign of increased ICP The patient may exhibit partial or total loss of motor and sensory function Pupillary changes may occur, such as unequal size, constriction, dilation, or reduced or absent responses to light Cushing's triad (bradycardia, bradypnea, and hypertension) is a late sign of increased Neurologic disorders Other signs and symptoms include changes in respiratory patterns, headache, seizures, vomiting, and a widening pulse pressure /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis is based on CT scan, skull X-rays, and ICP monitoring The goal of treatment is to normalize ICP and avoid complications, such as brain herniation, diabetes insipidus, and SIADH Pressures are carefully monitored by means of epidural monitoring, subarachnoid screw and bolt, or intraventricular monitoring CSF blockage is corrected by surgical placement of shunts; a tumor or hematoma also is removed surgically; craniectomy or burr holes may be required for decompression Drug therapy may include an antibiotic to treat or prevent infection, an anticonvulsant to prevent seizures, and a diuretic to prevent cerebral edema Hyperventilation therapy is used to reduce the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood level, which decreases cerebral edema and ICP Metabolic disorders are corrected Lumbar puncture is contraindicated in a patient with increased ICP because it can cause life- threatening herniation (shifting of brain contents into another compartment) /H18546Nursing interventions Provide bed rest, with the head of the bed elevated 30 to 45 degrees to promote venous drainage from the cranium Avoid neck extension, fl exion, and rotation to promote optimal venous drainage Avoid hip fl exion above 60 degrees, which can lead to increased intra-abdominal pressure that increases ICP Monitor and document fl uid intake and output until the patient's condition is stable to ensure proper hydration Excessive urine output may indicate diabetes insipidus due to posterior pituitary gland damage; it's treated with Fluid retention may indicate SIADH due to craniocerebral trauma; it's treated with fl uid restriction Slowly infuse I.V. bolus medications; rapid infusion can trigger an abrupt increase in brain fl uid volume Administer an analgesic, an antibiotic, an anticonvulsant, and a diuretic as prescribed Perform neurologic assessments hourly until the patient's condition is stable to help prevent compli- cations, and then every 4 hours or as prescribed; watch for changes in LOC and motor responses using the Glasgow Coma Scale (see Using the Glasgow Coma Scale , page 174) Monitor vital signs hourly until the patient's condition is stable Monitor the patient for signs of bleeding and hypovolemia\u2014for example, by checking stools, urine, and vomitus for occult blood; systemic bleeding may signal coagulopathy, which increases the risk of intracranial bleeding Place pads loosely over the ears or under the nose to absorb leaking CSF (a clear liquid that leaves yellow halos on linen and tests positive for glucose); change pads frequently to prevent pathogens from migrating through the CSF to the brain Use aseptic technique to prevent systemic or intracranial infection, which increases the risk of further increases in ICP Closely monitor respiratory status by auscultating breath sounds and checking tissue oxygenation with noninvasive pulse oximeters; encourage deep breathing Hypoxemia and hypercapnia further elevate ICP; coughing and inspired spirometry temporarily increase ICP Bed rest and altered LOC increase the risks of atelectasis and pneumonia Assist with turning in bed, and teach the patient to breathe while moving to avoid straining, which can increase ICP Maintain a quiet environment: limit noise, light, visitors, and emotional stress; overstimulation can 8/2/2011 2:53:06 PMMeningitis 177 Provide nutritional support as appropriate to maintain normal fl uid and electrolyte balance; tube feedings may be required Teach the patient to avoid performing Valsalva's maneuver; also, tell him to avoid coughing, hold- ing his breath while lifting, sneezing, straining during defecation, and vomiting; all of these actions increase ICP Provide emotional support to the patient and his family Meningitis /H18546Description Meningitis is an infl ammation of the subarachnoid space and meninges; it can be classi ed as septic (caused by bacterial infection) or aseptic (caused by viral infection) Exudate formation causes meningeal irritation and increased ICP Meningococcal meningitis is caused organism Haemophilus infl uenzae meningitis is the most common bacterial meningitis in infants and children Pneumococcal meningitis is caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae; it can be a severe complication of an upper respiratory tract infection, is the most common type of meningitis after neurosurgery, and has a high mortality rate Tuberculous meningitis is a bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis; it's generally self-limiting and benign Infecting organisms gain entry to the subarachnoid space through basilar skull fractures with dural tears, chronic otitis media or sinusitis, neurosurgical contamination, penetrating head wounds, septice-mia, or bloodstream infections /H18546Signs and symptoms The cardinal signs and symptoms of meningitis are those of infection (including chills, fever, and malaise) and those of increased ICP (including headache and vomiting) Other signs and symptoms include changes in LOC, irritability, and seizures Signs and symptoms of brain and spinal cord irritation may include Brudzinski's sign (leg adduction and fl exion when the neck is fl exed), Kernig's sign (resistance to extension when thigh is fl exed up to the abdomen), nuchal rigidity, and severe headache Irritation of cranial nerve (CN) II may cause blindness and papilledema; of CN III, IV, and VI, dip- lopia, impaired movement, and unequal or deafness and vertigo /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis may be based on physical examination ndings and the results of lumbar puncture, sero- logic studies, and cultures of blood, urine, nasal or pharyngeal mucosa, sputum, and skin lesions Meningitis is treated with organism-speci c antibiotic therapy An anticonvulsant may be administered to decrease the risk of seizures; an analgesic may be given to reduce headache, which is common with meningitis Prophylactic antibiotic therapy may be prescribed for family members and other people who have had close contact with a patient who has bacterial meningitis Supportive measures include reducing fever, ensuring adequate hydration and nutrition, providing mechanical ventilation, if necessary, and preventing and treating increased ICP /H18546Nursing interventions Perform neurologic examinations, and check vital signs hourly; early detection of increased ICP, hyperthermia, hydrocephalus, and shock can help prevent complications Implement isolation techniques if the causative agent is highly contagious; bacterial meningitis is transmitted by direct and sometimes indirect contact with respiratory droplets from infected people and carriers Report meningococcal meningitis to local health authorities; report other bacterial meningitis in endemic areas only Monitor fl uid intake and output to prevent overhydration, which can lead to cerebral edema and increased Neurologic disorders Provide nutritional support to maintain response and fl uid and electrolyte balance; enteral feedings may be required Provide proper positioning, skin care, and ROM exercises to prevent complications of immobility, such as contracture deformities, muscle wasting, pneumonia, and pressure ulcers Provide a comfortable, quiet, dimly lit environment to help prevent seizures and to reduce the dis- comfort of photophobia Give emotional support to the patient and family Provide referrals for rehabilitation if neurologic de cits are permanent Multiple sclerosis /H18546Description Multiple sclerosis is a progressive neurologic disease caused by destruction, injury, or malformation of the myelin sheaths that cover nerves Plaques (areas of demyelination) can occur anywhere in the nervous system but are most common on the white matter of the brain and spinal cord and the optic nerves; plaques slow or stop saltatory con-duction, the normally rapid conduction of nerve impulses Although the exact cause is unknown, multiple sclerosis may be triggered by a slow, progressive viral disease; an autoimmune disorder; or an allergic reaction to an infection Multiple sclerosis is characterized by unpredictable exacerbations and remissions; symptoms worsen with each episode /H18546Signs and symptoms Symptoms of multiple sclerosis may be transient, variable, and bizarre The rst symptoms are usually sensory and visual problems, such as burning, electrical sensations, and pins and needles Ocular disturbances may include blurred vision, diplopia, nystagmus, neuritis Muscle dysfunction\u2014including to quadriplegia, spasticity, and weakness\u2014may also occur Urinary disturbances may include frequency, incontinence, urgency, and frequent infections Bowel problems include constipation and involuntary evacuation Fatigue is usually the most debilitating symptom; speech disturbance may also occur /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnostic tests may include lumbar puncture, CT scan, evoked response, and MRI of the brain and spinal cord to detect plaques from multiple sclerosis; optic atrophy typically is present, and evoked potential of the brain stem and rolandic somatosensory responses may be abnormal Because multiple sclerosis has no cure, treatment aims to decrease the length and severity of exacer- bations and diminish or reverse the de cits caused by exacerbations Drug therapy consists of a corticosteroid and a muscle relaxant; interferon beta-1b may be used to reduce the frequency of exacerbations in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis; glatiramer acetate may also be helpful in reducing the frequency of relapses in such patients Occupational, physical, and speech therapies and nutritional counseling are used to help the patient manage the disorder's effects The patient may also need home care, or he may need to stay in an extended-care facility /H18546Nursing interventions Teach the patient and his family about the disease and strategies for avoiding stress, fatigue, and infections, factors that can exacerbate it Administer carbamazepine, phenytoin, or amitriptyline to control pain from dysesthesias or other pain syndromes such as trigeminal neuralgia; transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and alterna-tive measures such as relaxation techniques can also help Encourage the patient to participate in physical therapy to maintain muscle strength and decrease spasms Encourage the patient to eat a balanced diet to maintain proper functioning of the immune system and avoid constipation Med-Surg_Chap10.indd 179 bowel and bladder training; loss of muscle and sphincter tone may require self- catheterization and daily suppositories Encourage good respiratory hygiene; tell the patient and family to contact the health care provider if the patient develops dyspnea, shortness of breath, or pulmonary infection Teach the patient and caregivers how to prevent complications of immobility; if bed rest or a wheel- chair is required, discuss transfer techniques and proper turning and positioning to prevent deformity Develop alternative forms of communication for use during exacerbations, such as eyelid blinking or using letter or picture boards Teach the patient to alternate rest and activity, avoid temperature extremes, and reduce stress Refer the patient to a support group or a local chapter of the Multiple Sclerosis Society Myasthenia gravis /H18546Description Myasthenia gravis is a chronic autoimmune disorder of neuromuscular transmission characterized by extreme, abnormal muscle weakness during activity; weakness can be relieved by rest It may be caused by a defect of the postsynaptic receptor sites or acetylcholine de ciency It affects neuromuscular transmission at the myoneural junction, leaving sensation intact and pre- venting muscle atrophy /H18546Signs and symptoms The dominant symptoms of myasthenia gravis are skeletal muscle fatigability and weakness; typi- cally, muscles are strongest in the morning but weaken throughout the day, especially after exercise The rst indications may include weak eye closure, diplopia, and ptosis The face may be blank and expressionless; the voice, nasal The patient experiences dif culty chewing and swallowing Weakened respiratory muscles may make breathing dif cult, leading to respiratory distress /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnostic tests may include thymus scan (to rule out the presence of thymoma and thymic hyper- plasia, both of which are associated with myasthenia gravis), chest X-ray, thyroid studies, electromy-ography, and the Tensilon test (to evaluate muscle contractility); if the Tensilon test is inconclusive, a neostigmine test is done An anticholinesterase alleviates symptoms but is ineffective during a crisis Corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy and thymectomy (if thymomas are present) may alter the course of the disease Plasmapheresis may relieve symptoms; it may be used to prepare the patient for thymectomy and during a respiratory crisis Ventilator support may be needed during a myasthenic crisis /H18546Nursing interventions Support respiratory function, encourage coughing and deep breathing, and use nasotracheal or oral tracheal suction when necessary to keep the airway open; use mechanical ventilation or a tracheostomy tube, if prescribed Schedule activity 20 to 30 minutes after medication is given, when strength is greatest, and space activities to avoid fatigue If the patient can't chew and swallow solid food, provide a semisoft diet; make sure he doesn't choke on liquids as a result of cranial nerve weakness Assess the patient for signs and symptoms of myasthenic crisis, such as anxiety, fever, increased weakness, problems with chewing and swallowing, and respiratory distress Assess the patient for signs and symptoms of cholinergic crisis, such as abdominal cramps, bradycar- dia, diarrhea, dyspnea, general weakness, lacrimation, muscle cramps, myasthenic crisis, nausea, respi-ratory distress, salivation, sweating, vomiting, and wheezing Teach the patient and his family about the disease, and suggest lifestyle changes such as scheduling activities during energy peaks Teach the patient and his family the signs of anticholinesterase toxicity\u2014such as diaphoresis, dyspnea, increased muscle weakness, nausea, and ensure prompt 8/2/2011 2:53:06 PM180 Neurologic disorders Teach the patient and his family the signs of respiratory distress and failure Provide emotional support, and refer the patient to the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America Parkinson's disease /H18546Description Parkinson's disease is a chronic, degenerative disease of the basal ganglia, substantia nigra, and corpus striatum of the brain; it's associated with a de ciency of the neurotransmitter dopamine Although the exact cause of Parkinson's disease is unknown, possible causes include exposure to a toxic agent such as carbon monoxide and manganese, genetic factors, vascular (arteriosclerotic) changes, and viral infection Iatrogenic Parkinson's disease can result from the use of major tranquilizers, methyldopa, and reser- pine; it's generally reversible within 2 weeks of discontinuing the drug /H18546Signs and symptoms Movement changes may include bradykinesia (extreme slowness of movement), cogwheel tremor or rigidity (jerky limb movement), festination (tendency to speed up each step to compensate for a dis-placed center of gravity), pill-rolling tremor (repeated rotary movement of the thumb and fore nger), and a slow, shuffl ing gait Other symptoms include decreased blinking; dysarthria; dysphagia; drooling; micro- graphia (handwriting oculogyric crisis (involuntary deviation and xation of the eyeballs); slow, slurred, monotone speech; and a wide-eyed, blank facial expression /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Physical examination and health history ndings may be con rmed by electromyography Treatment aims at slowing the progression of symptoms and providing supportive care Antiparkinsonians are prescribed: Levodopa decreases muscle rigidity and an anticholinergic decreases rigidity and tremors The antiviral amantadine is used early on to reduce tremors and rigidity The dopamine receptor The monoamine oxidase type B inhibitor selegiline allows conservation of dopamine and enhances the therapeutic effect of levodopa The catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors entacapone (Comtan) and tolcapone (Tasmar) inhibit the breakdown of dopamine and may be useful as adjuncts to levodopa Patients may bene t from physical therapy Referrals may be provided for home health assistants, visiting nurses, adult day care, or nursing home placement /H18546Nursing interventions Administer medications as prescribed Encourage physical therapy to maintain muscle function as long as possible Teach the patient and family about the disease and the drugs' adverse effects Teach the patient and family about home safety; suggest they remove throw rugs and loose carpeting and install grab bars and elevated toilet seats in the bathrooms; recommend the use of a cane or walker for a patient in the later stages of Parkinson's disease Teach the patient and his family about preventing constipation by encouraging adequate nutrition and hydration; stress the importance of establishing a regular pattern of elimination Provide emotional support for the patient and family, and refer them to Parkinson's disease support groups Seizure disorders /H18546Description Seizures are sudden paroxysmal discharges of a group of neurons that interfere with normal mental and behavioral activities Seizures may be triggered by toxic states, electrolyte imbalances, tumors, anoxia, CNS PMSeizure disorders 181 /H18546Signs and symptoms Seizure symptoms vary with the type of seizure (see Differentiating seizures ) Seizures have three phases The prodromal phase occurs before the seizure and produces auras (sensory signals that warn of an approaching seizure), such as a fl ash of light, mood or behavior changes, or a sudden sensation of smell or taste; this phase lasts from seconds to days The ictal phase is the seizure itselfPartial seizures Partial seizures arise from a localized area in the brain and cause speci c symptoms. In some patients, partial seizure activity spreads to the entire brain, causing a generalized sei-zure. Partial seizures include simple partial (Jacksonian mo-tor-type and sensory-type), complex partial (psychomotor or temporal lobe), and secondarily generalized partial seizures. Simple partial (Jacksonian motor-type) seizure A simple partial seizure begins as a localized motor seizure, which is characterized by a spread of abnormal activity to adjacent areas of the brain. Typically, the patient experiences a stiffening or jerking in one extremity, accompanied by a tin-gling sensation in the same area. For example, the seizure may start in the thumb and spread to the entire hand and arm. The patient seldom loses consciousness, although the seizure may secondarily progress to a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Simple partial (sensory-type) seizure Perception is distorted in a simple partial seizure. Symptoms can include hallucinations, fl ashing lights, tingling sensa- tions, a foul odor, vertigo, or d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu (the feeling of having experienced something before). Complex partial (psychomotor or temporal lobe) seizure Symptoms of a complex partial seizure vary but usually in- clude purposeless behavior. The patient may experience an aura and exhibit overt signs, including a glassy stare, picking at his clothes, aimless wandering, lip-smacking or chewing motions, and unintelligible speech. The seizure may last for a few seconds or as long as 20 minutes. Afterward, mental confusion may last for several minutes; as a result, an observ-er may mistakenly suspect psychosis or intoxication with alcohol or drugs. The patient has no memory of his actions during the seizure. Secondarily generalized partial seizure A secondarily generalized partial seizure can be either simple or complex and can progress to generalized seizures. An aura may precede the progression. Loss of consciousness occurs immediately or within 1 to 2 minutes of the start of the progression.Generalized seizures As the term suggests, generalized seizures cause a general-ized electrical abnormality in the brain. They include several distinct types, including absence (petit mal), myoclonic, gen-eralized tonic-clonic (grand mal), and akinetic. Absence (petit mal) seizure An absence seizure commonly occurs in children but also may affect adults. It usually begins with a brief change in the level of consciousness, indicated by blinking or rolling of the eyes, a blank stare, and slight mouth movements. The patient retains his posture and continues preseizure activity without dif culty. Typically, the seizure lasts from 1 to 10 seconds. The impairment is so brief that the patient is sometimes unaware of it. If not properly treated, these sei-zures can recur as often as 100 times a day. An absence sei-zure can progress to a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Myoclonic seizure A myoclonic seizure\u2014also called bilateral massive epileptic myoclonus\u2014is marked by brief, involuntary muscular jerks of the body or extremities, which may occur in a rhythmic manner, and a brief loss of consciousness. Generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure Typically, a generalized tonic-clonic seizure begins with a loud cry, precipitated by air rushing from the lungs through the vocal cords. The patient falls to the ground, losing con-sciousness. The body stiffens (tonic phase) and then alter-nates between episodes of muscle spasm and relaxation (clonic phase). Tongue biting, incontinence, labored breath-ing, apnea, and subsequent cyanosis may also occur. The seizure stops in 2 to 5 minutes, when abnormal electrical conduction of the neurons is completed. The patient then regains consciousness but is somewhat confused and may have dif culty talking. If he can talk, he may complain of drowsiness, fatigue, headache, muscle soreness, and arm or leg weakness. He may fall into a deep sleep after the seizure. Akinetic seizure An akinetic seizure is characterized by a general loss of pos-tural tone and a temporary loss of consciousness. This type of seizure occurs in young children. Sometimes it's called a drop attack because it causes the child to fall.Differentiating seizures Seizures can be classi ed as partial or generalized.

Injury Description Possible effects Concussion Severe shaking Temporary loss of function for 24 to 48 hours Contusion Bruising of the spinal cord Spinal cord compression by bleeding and edema, causing varying degrees of damage Dislocated vertebrae Rupture of spinal ligaments and disrup-tion of vertebral alignmentSpinal cord disruption Hemorrhage Bleeding from an aneurysm or other ruptureSpinal cord irritation by blood and edema, causing neurologic de cits Herniated disk syndromeAnterior, lateral, or posterior displace- of intervertebral disk, especially in lumbar and lumbosacral areasSpinal cord injury caused by displaced tissue that compresses nerve roots and narrows the spinal canal Laceration Tear in the spinal cord Spinal cord compression by bleeding and edema, causing permanent damage Transection Severing of the spinal cord Complete or incomplete loss of spinal cord function Vertebral fracture Comminuted (burst) Shattering of vertebrae Fragment penetration of spinal cord Compressed Compression or anterior wedging of vertebraeSpinal cord compression Odontoid (hangman's) Fracture of odontoid process of second cervical vertebraTypically fatal injury of spinal cord and all organs below the fracture Simple Single break, usually of a transverse or spinous processSpinal cord unaffected if vertebrae remain aligned Stable Fracture without bone displacement No permanent damage if properly immobilized Unstable Fracture with bone displacement Spinal cord injury, instant quadriplegia, and loss of respiratory functionTypes of spinal cord injury pain and temperature sensation below the lesion (senses of touch, vibration, position, and motion remain intact) Posterior cord syndrome is damage to the posterior gray and white matter of the spinal cord; it usually results from an extension injury and impairs vibratory sensation, light touch, and proprio-ception (motor function, pain, and temperature sensation remain intact) Brown-S\u00e9quard syndrome is damage to one side of the spinal cord; it results from a penetrating injury (such as a gunshot or stab wound) Rotation-fl exion injury causes unilateral damage Ipsilateral damage below the lesion affects motor function, pressure and touch sensations, and the senses of vibration and position Contralateral damage causes loss of pain and temperature sensations Horner syndrome can occur as part of Brown-S\u00e9quard syndrome or result from damage to the midbrain; it occurs ipsilaterally to a cervical lesion and causes anhidrosis (lack of sweat), ptosis, and pupillary contraction on the affected side of the face Med-Surg_Chap10.indd Med-Surg_Chap10.indd 183 8/2/2011 2:53:07 PM 8/2/2011 2:53:07 PM184 Neurologic disorders Spinal cord injury may result from trauma (see Mechanisms of spinal cord injury ); it also can result from organic causes, such as arteriovenous malformation, emboli, hematoma, infection, and tumor /H18546Motor loss caused by spinal cord injury Paralysis is a temporary or permanent loss of function Spastic paralysis is the loss of voluntary movement caused by damage to upper motor neurons; the lower motor neurons may be intact, in which case, the refl ex arc remains intact Flaccid paralysis is the loss of voluntary movement caused by damage to the lower motor neurons; refl exes, including (absent), 1+ (increased), or 4+ (hyperactive) graded as 0 (absent), +/ (diminished or inconsistent), or + (normal) /H18546Level of spinal cord injury and associated motor loss Injury to the cord at the C1 to C4 level causes quadriplegia and loss of respiratory function Injury to the cord at the C4 to C5 level causes quadriplegia and may affect respiratory function if edema damages the phrenic nerve Injury to the cord at the C5 to C6 level causes quadriplegia; gross motor movement of the arms remains intact with use of the scapular elevators; diaphragmatic breathing remains intact but may not be able to support ventilation because of the loss of intercostal muscle innervation Injury to the cord at the C6 to C7 level causes quadriplegia; diaphragmatic breathing remains intact but may not be able to support ventilation; arm muscles remain innervated and capable of elbow fl ex- ion, wrist extension, and weak thumb grasp Injury to the cord at the C7 to C8 level causes quadriplegia; diaphragmatic breathing remains intact, but ventilation and airway secretion removal may be compromised because of loss of intercostal muscle innervation; biceps and triceps muscles respond to voluntary control, and wrist fl exion may be possibleSpinal cord injury may result from various types of trauma. Mechanism Possible effects Compression injury Caused by vertical fall, such as diving into shallow water Vertebral and spinal cord damage Flexion Caused by violent impact to back of head Anterior dislocation of vertebrae Rupture of posterior ligaments Hyperextension (whiplash) Caused by violent impact to the chin Rupture of anterior ligaments Rupture of intervertebral disks and vertebrae Penetrating injury Caused by a gunshot wound or stab injury Spinal cord damage that disrupts tissue function Rotation injury Caused by violent rotation in opposite directions of top and bottom of body Rupture of ligaments, vertebrae, and disksMechanisms of spinal cord injury Med-Surg_Chap10.indd 184 Med-Surg_Chap10.indd 184 8/2/2011 2:53:07 PM 8/2/2011 2:53:07 PMSpinal cord injury 185 Injury to the cord between the T1 and L1 to L2 levels causes paraplegia; voluntary motor function of the arms remains intact; loss of some intercostal muscle innervation may impede ventilation and secre-tion removal Injury to the cauda equina causes mixed loss of motor, sensory, bowel, bladder, and sexual function and depends on which roots are damaged Injury to the sacral spinal nerves causes loss of bowel, bladder, and sexual function /H18546Spinal shock Spinal shock is caused by sudden, severe spinal cord damage and initially produces fl accid paralysis; arefl exia below the level and loss of cutaneous and proprioceptive sensations occur in the rst few hours and may last for weeks Recovery occurs over time; refl ex activity returns in 3 to 6 weeks; fl exion spasms affect paralyzed limbs 6 to 16 weeks after injury; alternating fl exion and extension spasms affect paralyzed limbs about 6 months after injury; extension spasms predominate after 6 months /H18546Autonomic dysrefl exia Autonomic dysrefl exia is a complication of complete spinal cord injury Injuries at or above T6 present the greatest risk, but autonomic dysrefl exia has been observed in inju- ries occurring at the T8 level Autonomic dysrefl exia is a clinical emergency and is caused by stimulation of the autonomic refl exes below the level of the lesion exia causes decreased heart rate, pallor, pilomotor spasm (goose bumps and hair erection), and severe, persistent Other ndings include blotchy skin, diaphoresis, fl ushing, lesion Autonomic dysrefl exia can be precipitated by various sensory stimuli, including a full bladder or rectum, painful stimuli (such as pressure on the skin, pressure ulcers, and surgical incisions), other skin stimulation (such as pressure on the glans penis or perianal or periurethral area), and visceral contrac-tions (such as bladder spasms and uterine contractions of pregnancy) Treatment aims to control blood pressure while locating and removing the sensory stimulus /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis is based on anterior and lateral X-rays of the spine, CT scan, and MRI Emergency life support is required to maintain vital function and avoid further injury; priorities include maintaining a patent airway; ensuring adequate ventilation (spontaneous or mechanical); main-taining adequate circulation; and performing neurologic assessments To prevent further injury, the spine is immobilized with a cervical collar, cervical traction or cervical tongs (such as Gardner-Wells, Crutch eld, Barton, Cone, and Vinke), kinetic bed with cervical tongs for skeletal traction, halo brace with vest (for long-term use), or surgery (by means of Harrington rods, Weiss springs, laminectomy, or spinal fusion) Clots, fragments, and tumors are surgically decompressed A steroid is administered for the rst 24 hours after the injury to reduce edema and infl ammatory response An analgesic and an opioid may be administered to control pain A muscle relaxant is given to reduce muscle spasm An antacid and an antihistamine are given to prevent gastric ulcers (traumatic events, such as spinal cord injury, can precipitate gastric ulcer formation) Anticoagulant therapy is initiated to prevent deep vein thrombosis; therapy may include low doses of heparin, thigh-high antiembolism stockings (which compress super cial veins and prevent periph- eral blood pooling), and sequential pneumatic compression devices (which massage the veins, mimic muscle action, and prevent peripheral blood pooling and thrombus formation) Rehabilitative management includes surgical release of tendons for persistent muscle spasm of para- lyzed muscles and surgical correction for cervical support (laminectomy and spinal fusions) Rehabilitation referrals include those for occupational and physical therapies, nutritional counseling, social services, and psychiatric evaluation and assistance Med-Surg_Chap10.indd 185 Med-Surg_Chap10.indd disorders /H18546Nursing interventions Provide respiratory support for a patient with a spinal cord injury above L1 to L2; support ranges from deep-breathing exercises to diaphragmatic coughing (exertion of abdominal pressure during coughing) to mechanical ventilation Continuously monitor and assess neurologic function to detect early signs of deterioration Modify the patient's environment to decrease dependence on others and increase his feelings of self-worth; discuss modi cations with the patient and his family before discharge; modi cations may include manual or electric wheelchairs, ramps, widened doorways, structural changes to bathroom facilities, and home care aides Provide frequent and proper positioning, skin care, and proper hydration and nutrition to prevent complications of immobility Teach the patient and his family about the recovery process, therapeutic and adverse effects of pre- scribed drugs, possible drug interactions, nutritional needs, exercise, bowel and bladder training, ways to prevent constipation and urinary tract infection, self-catheterization techniques, skin care, proper positioning, ways to avoid infection (especially respiratory infection), symptoms to report to the practi-tioner, and local support groups Provide emotional support to the patient and family; permanent physical disabilities can be devastat- ing to self-concept, relationships, and lifestyle; emotional support, particularly from others with similar experiences, can facilitate healing Stroke /H18546Description Stroke is a disruption in cerebral circulation, causing permanent neurologic de cits An embolic stroke may result from atherosclerotic plaque, an embolism, or vasospasm A thrombotic ischemic stroke occurs when the occlusion evolves from partial to complete and may be heralded by a transient ischemic attack A hemorrhagic stroke may result from a ruptured or leaking aneurysm, an arteriovenous malforma- tion, a bleeding disorder, trauma, or an arterial rupture (as caused by hypertension) /H18546Signs and symptoms Symptoms of stroke vary with the affected artery (see Signs and symptoms of stroke ) Symptoms also vary according to the severity of the damage and the extent of collateral circulation /H18546Diagnosis and treatment CT scan, MRI, cerebral arteriography, lumbar puncture, Doppler fl ow studies, and EEG may be used to diagnose stroke Carotid endarterectomy removes plaque to improve cerebral blood fl ow Surgical evacuation of the clot or hematoma relieves increased ICP Although anticoagulants are contraindicated in a patient with a hemorrhagic stroke, they may be useful in a patient with a nonhemorrhagic thrombolytic event An anticonvulsant is used to prevent or treat seizures Tissue plasminogen activator can improve neurologic function when given within 3 hours of the onset of symptoms in a patient with a thrombotic stroke An analgesic is used to relieve discomfort such as headache An antihypertensive is used to lower blood pressure and, thus, prevent additional bleeding A diuretic is used to lower blood pressure and reduce cerebral edema Physical therapy and occupational therapy help maintain muscle and joint function while teaching the patient needed home management techniques /H18546Nursing interventions Provide emergency care; the patient may require lifesaving measures because of cardiopulmonary arrest triggered by the injury; administer oxygen, if needed, to promote oxygenation within the cerebral tissue Maintain a patent airway; the patient may be unable to protect his airway because of impaired cough and gag refl exes and inability to support his head; suction the patient as necessary Med-Surg_Chap10.indd 186 Med-Surg_Chap10.indd 186 8/2/2011 2:53:07 PM 8/2/2011 2:53:07 PMStroke 187 Make sure the patient maintains bed rest until the cause of the stroke is known because activity can cause bleeding to recur Position the patient to prevent deformity; loss of muscle tone leads to fl exion contractures; turn and position him every 2 hours to prevent pressure ulcers Implement physical therapy to maintain strength and prevent contractures; provide passive ROM exercises to prevent venous thrombosis and contractures Speak slowly and simply; the patient may not be able to understand rapid speech and may become confused Monitor vital signs at least hourly until the patient's condition is stable; alterations can indicate fur- ther injury Assess neurologic status hourly until the patient's condition is stable; early identi cation and treat- ment of increased ICP (signs include abnormal posturing, bradycardia, decreased LOC, decreased motor response, increased systolic blood pressure, and widened pulse pressure) may prevent further injury Monitor fl uid input and output hourly to ensure hydration until the patient's condition is stable Ensure nutritional status by helping the patient to eat or by providing enteral or parenteral feedings when necessaryMiddle cerebral artery When a stroke occurs in the middle cerebral artery, the pa- tient may experience: altered level of consciousness (LOC) aphasia contralateral hemiparesis (more severe in the face and arm than in the leg) contralateral sensory de cit dysgraphia dysphagia dyslexia visual eld cuts Carotid artery When a stroke occurs in the carotid artery, the patient may experience: altered LOC aphasia bruits over the carotid artery headaches numbness, paralysis, sensory changes, transient vision loss, and weakness on the affected side ptosis Vertebrobasilar artery When a stroke occurs in the pa- tient may experience: amnesia ataxia diplopia dizziness dysphagia numbness around the lips and mouth poor coordination slurred speech visual eld cuts weakness on the affected side Anterior cerebral artery When a stroke occurs in the anterior cerebral artery, the pa- tient may experience: confusion impaired motor and sensory function incontinence loss of coordination numbness and weakness on the affected side personality changes Posterior cerebral arteries When a stroke occurs in the posterior cerebral arteries, paralysis is usually absent;

The nurse is caring for a patient with a C7 spinal cord injury who develops bradycardia, hypertension, and sweating. Which intervention should the nurse perform rst? /H18540A. Palpating the patient's bladder /H18540B. Lying the patient fl at in bed /H18540C. Covering the patient with a blanket /H18540D. Performing a rectal examination Correct answer: A Bradycardia, hypertension, and sweating are signs of autonomic dysrefl exia, a com- plication that may occur with a spinal cord injury at or above T6. Because a distended bladder is one of the most common causes of autonomic dysrefl exia, the nurse should palpate the patient's bladder for fullness. If the patient has an indwelling urinary catheter, the nurse should check it for patency and kinks. Option B is incorrect because appropriate interventions for autonomic dysrefl exia include elevat- ing the head of the bed to promote cerebral venous return; dangling the patient's feet over the side of the bed, if possible, to promote an orthostatic reduction in blood pressure; and keeping the patient from lying fl at. Option C is incorrect because anything that may stimulate the skin, such as a blanket or shoes, should be removed. Although a distended rectum is another common cause of autonomic dysrefl exia, option D is incorrect because the nurse shouldn't check for fecal impaction until an anesthetic has been applied to reduce stimulation. 2. The nurse is caring for a comatose patient who has suffered a closed head injury. Which intervention should the nurse implement to prevent increases in ICP? /H18540A. Suctioning the airway every hour and as needed /H18540B. Elevating the head of the bed 30 to 45 degrees /H18540C. Turning the patient and changing his position every 2 hours /H18540D. Maintaining a well-lit room Correct answer: B To facilitate venous drainage and avoid jugular compression, the nurse should elevate the head of the bed 30 to 45 degrees. Option A is incorrect because patients with increased ICP poorly tolerate suctioning and shouldn't be suctioned on a regular basis. Option C is incorrect because turning from side to side increases the risk of jugular compression and rises in ICP. Option D is incorrect because the room should be kept quiet and dimly lit. 3. The nurse is teaching the patient with multiple sclerosis. When teaching the patient how to reduce fatigue, the nurse should tell the patient to: /H18540A. take a hot bath. /H18540B. rest in an air-conditioned room. /H18540C. increase the dose of his muscle relaxant. /H18540D. avoid naps during the day. disorders Correct answer: B Fatigue is a common symptom in patients with multiple sclerosis. Lowering the body temperature by resting in an air-conditioned room may relieve fatigue; however, extreme cold should be avoided. Option A is incorrect because a hot bath or shower can increase body temperature and produce fatigue. Option C is incorrect because muscle relaxants are prescribed to reduce spasticity and can cause drowsiness and fatigue. Option D is incorrect because taking frequent rest periods and naps can relieve fatigue. Other measures to reduce fatigue in the patient with multiple sclerosis include treating depres-sion, using occupational therapy to learn energy conservation techniques, and reducing spasticity. 4. To encourage adequate nutritional intake for a patient with Alzheimer's disease, the nurse should: /H18540A. stay with the patient, and encourage him to eat. /H18540B. help the patient ll out his menu. /H18540C. give the patient privacy during meals. /H18540D. ll out the menu for the patient. Correct answer: A Staying with the patient and encouraging him to feed himself will ensure adequate food intake. A patient with Alzheimer's disease can forget to eat. Filling out the patient's menu (Option B), allowing privacy during meals (Option C), or lling out the menu for the patient (Option D) don't ensure adequate nutritional intake. 5. The nurse is teaching a patient and his family about dietary practices related to Parkinson's disease. A priority for the nurse to address is risk of: /H18540A. fl uid overload and drooling. /H18540B. aspiration and anorexia. /H18540C. choking and diarrhea. /H18540D. dysphagia and constipation. Correct answer: D Eating problems associated with Parkinson's disease include aspiration, choking, constipation, and dysphagia. Option A is incorrect since fl uid overload isn't speci cally related to Parkin- son's disease and, although drooling occurs with Parkinson's disease, it doesn't take priority. Anorexia (Option B) and diarrhea (Option C) aren't speci cally associated with Parkinson's disease. 6. An elderly patient has just suffered a stroke that has left him with amnesia. Amnesia is a symptom associated with damage to which vessel? /H18540A. Carotid artery /H18540B. Anterior cerebral arteries /H18540C. Vertebrobasilar artery /H18540D. Middle cerebral artery Correct answer: C Damage to the vertebrobasilar artery can produce amnesia. Damage to the other arteries (Options A, B, and D) doesn't produce amnesia. 7. Which condition places a patient at embolic brillation and rapid discharge from multiple ectopic atrial foci that causes quivering of the atria without atrial systole. This asynchronous atrial contraction predisposes the patient to mural thrombi, which may embolize, leading to a stroke. Bradycardia (Option B), deep vein thrombosis (Option C), and a history of MI (Option D) don't lead to arterial embolization. 8. After a patient experiences a brain stem infarction, the nurse should observe the face or arm Correct answer: B The brain stem contains the medulla and the vital cardiac, vasomotor, and respira- tory centers. A brain stem infarction leads to vital sign changes such as bradypnea. Aphasia (Option A) is associated with lobar strokes in the cerebral hemispheres. Although contralateral hemiplegia (Option C) and numbness and tingling in the face or arm (Option D) may occur with certain types of strokes, they generally don't occur with brain stem infarction. 9. In a patient with meningitis, irritation to which CN could cause photophobia? /H18540A. III /H18540B. IV /H18540C. V /H18540D. VI Correct answer: C Irritation to CN V may cause photophobia. Irritation to CN III (Option A), IV (Option B), and VI (Option D) may cause diplopia, impaired ocular movement, ptosis, and unequal pupils. 10. A patient with a subdural hematoma becomes restless and confused, with dilation of the ipsilateral pupil. The physician orders mannitol for which reason? /H18540A. To reduce intraocular pressure /H18540B. To prevent acute tubular necrosis /H18540C. To promote osmotic diuresis to decrease ICP /H18540D. To draw water into the vascular system to increase blood pressure Correct answer: C Mannitol promotes osmotic diuresis by increasing the pressure gradient, drawing fl uid from intracellular to intravascular spaces. Although mannitol also reduces intraocular pressure (Option A), helps prevent acute tubular necrosis (Option B), and draws water into the vascular system to increase blood pressure (Option D), its most pressing use for this patient is to reduce ICP.Review questions 191 Med-Surg_Chap10.indd 191 /H18546The musculoskeletal system provides the structure and leverage that permits mobility Bones of the skeletal system serve as a reservoir for calcium and a manufacturing facility for red blood cells, white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets Alterations in the musculoskeletal system can result from soft-tissue injury, bone fractures, infections, and tumors /H18546Various tests are used to assess musculoskeletal integrity Nursing history /H18546The nurse asks the patient about his chief complaint The patient with a joint injury may report a joint deformity, pain, stiffness, swelling, or sensory alteration A patient with a fracture may report deformity or pain A patient with a muscular injury may report pain, swelling, weakness, or sensory alteration /H18546The nurse then questions the patient about his present illness Ask the patient about his symptom, including when it started, associated symptoms, location, radiation, intensity, duration, frequency, and precipitating and alleviating factors Ask the patient if activities of daily living (ADL s) are affected; question him about the use of assistive devices, such as a cane, walker, or crutches Ask about the use of prescription and over-the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, and vitamin and nutritional supplements /H18546The nurse asks about medical history Question the patient about other musculoskeletal disorders, such as arthritis, gout, osteoporosis, and trauma Ask the female patient whether she uses an oral contraceptive or is undergoing hormone therapy and whether she's premenopausal or postmenopausal /H18546The nurse then assesses the family history Ask about a family history of musculoskeletal problems Also ask about a family history of chronic and genetic disorders /H18546The nurse obtains a social history Ask about work, exercise, diet, use of recreational drugs and alcohol, and hobbies Also ask about stress, support systems, and coping mechanisms Assess how the patient functions at home; determine his ability to get around, climb stairs, and drive /H18546Physical assessment The nurse begins with inspection Note the size and shape of joints, limbs, and body regions; note body symmetry Inspect the skin and tissues around the joint, limb, or body region for color, swelling, masses, and deformities Observe how the patient stands and moves; watch him walk, noting his gait, posture, arm movements, and coordination11Musculoskeletal disordersMusculoskeletal disorders tendinitis 193 Inspect the curvature of his spine To check range of motion (ROM), ask the patient to abduct, adduct, and fl ex or extend affected joints Inspect major muscle groups for tone, strength, symmetry, and abnormalities; note contractures and abnormal movements, such as spasms, tics, tremors, and fasciculations Next, the nurse uses palpation Palpate the patient's bones, noting any deformities, masses, or tenderness Evaluate the patient's muscle tone, mass, and strength Palpate joints for tenderness, nodes, crepitus, and temperature at rest and during passive ROM Palpate arterial pulses, and check capillary re ll time Check neurovascular status, including movement and sensation Bursitis and tendinitis (also called tendinopathy that affects the tendons and tendon- muscle attachments; it most commonly affects the shoulder rotator cuff, Achilles' tendon, hip, elbow, and knee Tendinitis is caused by abnormal body development, hypermobility in calci c tendinitis, muscu- loskeletal diseases and congenital defects), postural malalignment, and trauma (such as overuse or straining during sports activities) Bursitis is a painful infl ammation of one or more bursae; it include septic, calci c, acute, and chronic Causes include common stressors (such as repetitive kneeling, prolonged sitting, or jogging in shoes without proper support) and recurrent trauma; septic bursitis can result from wound infection Both bursitis and tendonitis typically occur in patients ages 15 to 50; overuse injuries are more likely to occur in high-risk populations, older adults, and athletes Complications result from scar tissue with subsequent disability /H18546Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms of tendinitis include pain on palpation over the affected muscle-tendon unit, warmth (in acute tendinitis), and restricted movement; in the elbow, tenderness may occur over the lat-eral epicondyle; in the knee, palpable tenderness may occur in the hamstring when the knee is fl exed at a 90-degree angle; and in the foot, crepitus may occur when the patient moves his foot Signs and symptoms of bursitis include tenderness over the affected site, erythema, and swelling (with severe bursitis) /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Various serum and urine tests rule out other disorders X-rays in tendinitis may show bony fragments, osteophyte sclerosis, or calcium deposits X-rays in calci c bursitis may show calcium deposits in the joint Ultrasonography in tendinitis reveals increased tendon diameter, localized tendon swelling and thickening, and tendon sheath swelling MRI in tendinitis shows tendon thickening, edema, and any tears in the tendon Arthrocentesis may identify causative microorganisms and other causes of infl ammation to rule out tendinitis Arthrography is usually normal in tendinitis, showing only minor irregularities on the tendon under the surface Treatment of both tendonitis and bursitis involves resting the affected area and providing symptom- atic management Medications include for infl ammation and analgesics for pain Antibiotics are used to treat septic bursitis interventions cold or heat therapies as ordered; protect the patient's skin when applying therapies Encourage rest of the affected area, including immobilization if indicated Elevate the affected area and apply gentle compression (elastic bandage or compression or neoprene sleeve) Inspect the area for changes in swelling or erythema Encourage the patient to participate in self-care to the extent possible, and provide extra time for activities and assistance as necessary Administer medications, such as NSAIDs and analgesics, as ordered Encourage the use of active ROM exercises; reinforce participation in physical therapy as appropriate and indicated Teach the patient about the disease and how to prevent future episodes Dislocations /H18546Description A dislocation occurs when the articulating surfaces of a joint come out of position Dislocations may result from trauma, diseases that affect the joint, or congenital weaknesses Dislocations may cause injury to blood vessels and nerves and change in the contour of the joint, length of the extremity, and axis of the dislocated bones /H18546Signs and symptoms The patient experiences pain at the affected joint Neurovascular compromise may occur, including loss of movement, paresthesia, and pulselessness /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis is based on patient history, physical examination, and X-rays Treatment consists of open or closed reduction, activity limitations as indicated, and pain relief /H18546Nursing interventions Immobilize and elevate the affected joint; apply cold compresses as indicated Assess neurovascular status before and after reduction, including strength of the pulse, capillary re ll time, sensation, movement, pain, and color of the skin Fractures, femoral /H18546Description A femoral fracture is a break in the femur anywhere along its shaft Transverse, oblique, and comminuted fractures are the most common types of femoral fractures and may be open or closed (see Types and causes of fractures ) A femoral fracture can occur at any age, as a result of a fall, an accident, a gunshot wound, or other injury /H18546Signs and symptoms Pain occurs at the fracture site Discoloration and deformity may also be present The fractured limb can't bear weight and may be shortened and externally rotated Other ndings may include an open wound, edema, and bruising Leg fractures may produce any or all of the ve Ps: pain, pallor, paralysis, paresthesia, and pulselessness /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis is based on patient history, physical examination, and X-rays that show the type and severity of the fracture Cold therapy is applied to the fracture site An opioid analgesic and a muscle relaxant are given to relieve pain If the patient has an open fracture or has undergone surgery to correct the fracture, an antibiotic is administered; tetanus prophylaxis may also be required Reduction of the fracture restores the displaced bone segments to their normal position With closed reduction, the bones are aligned by manual manipulation or traction; immobilization is by splint, cast, femoral 195 With open reduction, the fracture is surgically reduced and immobilized with rods, plates, screws, and an immobilization device When a splint or cast fails to maintain the reduction, immobilization requires skin or skeletal traction, using a series of weights and pulleys (see Skeletal and skin tractions, page 196) With skin traction, elastic bandages and moleskin coverings are used to attach the traction devices to the patient's skin With skeletal traction, a pin or wire is inserted through the bone distal to the fracture and attached to a weight, allowing more prolonged traction /H18546Nursing interventions Perform neurovascular checks, which will provide data needed to formulate a care plan (see Neurovascular checks, page 198) Assess vital signs, and monitor the patient for signs of shock because signi cant blood loss may occur with a femur fracture Assess the patient for signs of fat embolism\u2014including confusion, dyspnea, hypotension, petechiae on the trunk, tachycardia, and tachypnea\u2014which can occur following the fracture of a long bone Apply cold packs to the fracture site; cold causes vasoconstriction, which decreases bleeding and edema and lessens painType of fracture Description Force causing the fracture Avulsion Fracture that pulls bone and other tissues from their usual attachmentsDirect force with resisted extension of the bone and joint Closed Skin is closed but bone is fractured Minor force Compression Fracture in which the bone is squeezed or wedged together at one sideCompressive, axial force applied directly above the fracture site Greenstick Break in only one cortex of the bone Minor direct or indirect force Impacted Fracture with one end wedged into the opposite end or into the fractured fragmentCompressive, axial force applied directly to the distal fragment Linear Fracture line runs parallel to bone's axis Minor or moderate direct force applied to the bone Oblique Fracture at an oblique angle across both corticesDirect or indirect force with angulation and some compression Open Skin is open, bone is fractured, and soft tissue trauma may occurModerate to severe force that is continuous and exceeds tissue tolerances Pathologic Transverse, oblique, or spiral fracture of a bone weakened by tumorMinor direct or indirect force Spiral Fracture curves around both cortices Direct or indirect twisting force, with the distal part of the bone held or unable to move Stress Crack in one cortex of a bone Repetitive direct force, as from jogging, running, or osteoporosis Transverse Horizontal break through the bone Direct or indirect force toward the boneTypes and causes of fractures Med-Surg_Chap11.indd PM 8/3/2011 7:39:12 PM196 disorders Type and description Purpose Nursing considerations Skeletal traction Balanced suspension to femur Used in patients age 3 and older on the upper tibia and thigh with 20 to 35 lb (9 to 16 kg) of weight Realignment of fractures of the femur Relief of muscle spasms associ- ated with femoral fractures A Steinmann pin or Kirschner wire is inserted through the upper tibia. The thigh and leg are suspended in a splint and leg attachment. Thigh and leg suspension is counterbalanced by trac- tion to the top of the thigh splint. The patient should be recumbent, but he can turn about 30 degrees to either side briefl y for back care or lift himself up using the trapeze and the uninjured leg and foot. Neurovascular checks are vital to assess circulatory status and prevent compartmental syndrome. Tissue pressure monitoring is performed. Cervical traction via skull tongs Used in patients of any age, but especially in young adults, bilaterally on skull bones with 20 to 30 lb (9 to 14 kg) of weight Realignment of fractures of cervical vertebrae Relief of pressure on cervical nerves Patients may be severely injured and may have quad- riplegia. Halo-pelvic traction Used in adolescents and young adults on the skull and pelvis with no weight (bars extending between the skull and pelvic por-tions hold the body in the desired position) Preoperative straightening of scoliosis curvature Pins are inserted into the skull in four areas to hold the halo. Pins are inserted through the iliac pelvic bones to hold the pelvis. Straightening is accomplished by tightening the bars, which overcomes muscle contractions. Traction is \"comfortable\" after the patient has recov- ered from the insertional trauma. Dressing is complicated because the vertical bars interfere with clothing. Traction may remain in place postoperatively to be replaced by a brace or cast. Halo-pelvic traction is a variant of halo-femoral trac- tion, in which the pins are inserted through the distal femurs instead of the pelvic bones, and the skull pins pull away from the femoral pins. Skin traction Buck's extension Most commonly used in adults on one or both legs with 5 to 8 lb (2.5 to 3.5 kg) of weight per leg Preoperative traction for hip fractures \"Pulling\" contracted muscles Relief of leg or back muscle spasms Patient generally lies recumbent. Patient may be turned to either side if no fracture is present or turned to the unaffected side if fracture is present. An older patient's skin is more friable and subject to loosening because of less subcutaneous fat. Patient may complain of burning under tape, moleskin, or traction boot. Traction may be removed for skin care even if fracture is present.Skeletal and considerations Skin traction (continued ) Cervical head halter Used in adults under the chin and around the face and back of the head with 5 to 15 lb (2.5 to 7 kg) of weight Relief of muscle spasms caused by degenerative or arthritic condi-tions of the cervical vertebrae or by muscle strain Halter should be applied so that the pull comes from the occipital area, not through the chin portion. Patients may be in low- or high-Fowler's position, depending on the purpose of the traction. If the patient complains of pain in the chin, teeth, or temporomandibular joint, the halter may be incorrectly positioned. Side straps should be adjusted to relieve these complaints. Patients should be removed from traction for sleeping. Patients can use this type of traction at home for cer- vical arthritic conditions. Cotrel's traction Used in adolescents and young adults with a head halter (5 to 7 lb [2.5 to 3 kg] of weight) and a pelvic belt (10 to 20 lb [4.5 to 9 kg] of weight) Preoperative muscle stretching in patients with scoliosis Pulling in opposite directions may cause pain or dis- comfort. Traction can be removed briefl y for massage and skin care. Dunlop's traction Used in adolescents and young adults on the lower humerus (5 to 7 lb of weight) and forearm (3 to 5 lb [1.5 to 2.5 kg] of weight) Realignment of fractures of the humerus Body is used for countertraction by slightly elevating side of bed of arm in traction. Forearm is held at a right angle to the humerus for comfort, by using Buck's extension on the forearm. Dunlop's traction can be used for skin traction (using Buck's extension to the humerus) or skeletal traction (using a Steinmann pin inserted through the distal humerus); use of skin or skeletal traction depends on the patient's injury. Traction to the forearm should be removed daily for skin care. Pelvic belt or girdle Used in older adolescents and adults on the abdomen or pelvis with 20 to 35 lb of weight Relief of muscle spasms and pain associated with disk condi-tions Pull comes from iliac crests to relieve spasm. Patient may be placed in the William's position, which permits 45-degree knee and hip fl exion to relax the lumbosacral muscles. Orders typically are \"in traction 2 hours, out 2 hours\" and out of traction at night. Traction straps shouldn't put pressure on sciatic nerves. Pelvic sling Used in adults under the pelvis and buttocks like a hammock with 20 to 35 lb of weight Holding of fractured pelvic bones Buttocks must be slightly off the bed. Patients are comfortable in the sling even with exten- sive pelvic bruising. They may become dependent on the sling and may require gradual weaning. The sling should be kept clean and dry. Patients can be removed from the sling for care and toileting if facility policy permits. Russell traction Used in patients age 5 and older on one or both legs with 2 to 5 lb (1 to 2.5 kg) of weight per leg Preoperative traction for hip fractures \"Pulling\" contracted muscles Treatment of Legg-Calv\u00e9- Perthes disease Pulley placement and amount of weight used are based on the principle that \"for every force in one direc-tion, there is an equal force in the opposite direction.\" Patient is positioned on back for most effective pull. Knee sling can be loosened for skin care and check- ing pulses in popliteal area.Skeletal and skin disorders Fractures may cause nerve or arterial damage, producing any or all of the ve Ps: pain, pallor, paralysis, paresthesia, and pulselessness. When performing a neurovascular check, compare ndings bilaterally and above and below the fracture. Pain Ask the patient if he's having pain. Assess the location, severity, and quality of the pain as well as anything that seems to relieve or worsen it. Pain that is unrelieved by an opioid or that worsens with elevating the limb (elevation reduces circulation and worsens ischemia) may indicate compartment syndrome.Paralysis Note any de cits in movement or strength. If the patient can't move the affected area or if movement causes severe pain and muscle spasms, he might have nerve or tendon damage. For a femoral fracture, assess peroneal nerve injury by checking for sensation over the top of the foot between the rst and second toes. Pallor Paleness, discoloration, and coolness of the injured site may indicate neurovascular compromise from de-creased blood supply to the area. Check capillary re ll time. Tissues should return to normal color within 3 seconds. Palpate skin temperature with the back of your hand.Paresthesia Ask the patient about changes in sensation, such as numbness or tingling. Check for loss of sensation by touching the injured area with the tip of an open safety pin or the point of a paper clip. Abnormal sensation or loss of sensation indicates neuro-vascular involvement. Pulselessness Palpate peripheral pulses distal to the injury, noting rate and quality. If a pulse is decreased or absent, blood supply to the area is reduced.Neurovascular checks Check and maintain the traction setup, if used (see Nursing considerations for patients in skeletal or skin traction ) Provide good cast care to prevent skin breakdown and other complications Provide appropriate postoperative care Keep the fractured leg elevated on a pillow to reduce edema by increasing venous return Apply cold therapy reduce bleeding and edema Help the patient sit in a chair with his leg elevated; upright positions increase peripheral circula- tion, which decreases edema Help the patient use an ambulatory aid when prescribed; weight bearing is restricted until some bone union occurs Administer an opioid analgesic, or monitor the use of patientcontrolled analgesia Encourage the patient to perform leg and foot exercises to maintain muscle and joint strength and decrease venous stasis Change dressings as needed, using strict aseptic technique, and administer an antibiotic, if pre- scribed; the patient is susceptible to wound infection and, possibly, osteomyelitis Provide good pin care by cleaning the insertion site daily with chlorhexidine solution and assess pin site for signs of infl ammation or infection Assess patient for signs of compartment syndrome (e.g., pallor; paresthesia; paralysis; and pain that is throbbing, intensi es with elevation, is unrelenting, and uncontrolled with analgesics) Monitor fl uid intake and output to ensure fl uid balance Help with discharge planning by anticipating the patient's discharge needs Fractures, hip /H18546Description Hip fracture is a fracture of the head, neck, trochanteric, or subtrochanteric regions of the PM 8/3/2011 7:39:13 hip 199 Nursing action Rationale Check ropes, knots, pulleys, freedom of movement, and intactness.These actions help ensure that the traction is functioning properly. Check the entire traction setup, pin site, and all suspen- sion apparatus for tightness or signs of loosening.These actions help ensure that the traction is functioning properly. Check weights to ensure that they're hanging freely. This action helps ensure that there is a proper amount of traction. Make sure the weights aren't \"lifted\" during care. This action helps to avoid pain caused by sudden muscle contraction and disrupted fragments of the injured or fractured bone. (Patients in skeletal traction should be moved for position changes without lifting or releasing the weights.) Take care not to bump the weights or weight holders. This action helps to avoid pain caused by rope movements that affect the traction bow and pin. Check all skin surfaces for signs of tolerance or pressure areas (especially on the occipital area of the head, shoul-der blades, elbows, coccyx, and heels).These actions may uncover signs of pressure, which include redness, tenderness or pain, soreness caused by excoriation, and numbness. Provide physical and psychological comfort. Answer questions honestly, answer the call light promptly, provide prompt and thorough care, encourage patient participation in care, provide diversionary activities, and prepare the patient and family for discharge.These actions help ensure that the patient participates in and is prepared for self-care.Nursing considerations for patients in skeletal or skin traction Intracapsular fractures are those of the femoral head and neck, which are inside the hip capsule; the hip capsule is made up of ligaments surrounding the hip joint Extracapsular fractures are those of the femoral trochanteric and subtrochanteric regions, which lie outside the ligaments of the hip capsule Hip fractures are most common in older people, particularly elderly women; many are associated with osteoporosis and falls /H18546Signs and symptoms The fractured limb is shortened and rotated externally; it can't bear weight Other ndings include hip discoloration, pain, and tenderness /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis is based on patient history, physical examination, and X-rays Intracapsular fracture requires open reduction with prosthetic replacement because of the high risk of loss of blood supply to the head of the femur, which leads to avascular necrosis Extracapsular fracture requires insertion of a sliding compression hip nail, hip nail with side plate, or multiple pins /H18546Preoperative nursing interventions Monitor traction setup and functioning; skin traction may be used as a temporary measure to reduce muscle spasms and increase patient comfort and safety Monitor neurovascular status; trauma disrupts arterial and venous vessels, leading to bruising, edema, pain, and color changes Monitor vital signs; fl uctuating vital signs may be caused by shock (up to 1,000 mL of blood may be lost into the hip joint), trauma, or a preexisting vascular condition; temperature typically is below nor-mal unless a urinary or respiratory tract infection exists disorders Perform other preoperative care, such as giving the patient nothing by mouth, having him empty his bladder, and checking his vital signs Send an abduction pillow to the operating room if the patient is receiving a prosthesis; the pillow helps keep the prosthesis in the hip joint until muscles and ligaments heal /H18546Postoperative nursing interventions Monitor vital signs and neurovascular status; surgical repair of hip fracture is traumatic because of bone and tissue injuries and can lead to complications, such as thrombophlebitis and fat or pulmonary embolism Monitor the amount and type of wound drainage; drainage should be serosanguineous and should total no more than 200 mL over 3 days Position the affected limb properly to prevent dislocation; use abduction if a prosthesis was inserted, but use a neutral position if another internal xation device was inserted Fit an overhead trapeze on the patient's bed so that he can use it to help lift himself off the bed using the unaffected limb Turn the patient on the nonoperative side as prescribed to facilitate circulation and recovery while easing tired muscles and relieving pressure; prop the operative limb with an abduction pillow if the patient has a prosthesis or with pillows if the patient has another internal xation device Teach the patient isometric quadriceps- and gluteal-setting exercises to strengthen muscles Encourage deep breathing and coughing every 2 hours, and use an incentive spirometer every 1 to 2 hours to prevent pulmonary complications Auscultate all lung lobes for breath sounds, which should be clear Check the color and amount of sputum, which should be clear Monitor fl uid intake and output and I.V. infusions; intake should be 3,000 mL daily; output should include 2,300 mL of urine and 300 to 700 mL of insensible water loss and perspiration Provide a regular diet as prescribed, and monitor bowel sounds; a patient with good bowel sounds who is passing fl atus can receive regular foods; nerve involvement from the hip may cause mild abdominal distention Assess skin, and provide skin care to pressure areas (e.g., heels, back, sacrum, shoulders, and elbows) Help the patient sit on the bed or in a chair on the rst postoperative day; initially, weight-bearing activity is prohibited because it can cause excessive pressure on internal xation devices; therefore, the patient must use a walker, which provides stability and allows ambulation with little or no weight bearing Make sure the hip isn't fl exed more than 90 degrees for up to 2 months after surgery; during the rst 10 postoperative days, even less fl exion may be allowed Administer an opioid analgesic, or monitor the use of patient-controlled analgesia To prevent thrombophlebitis, administer an anticoagulant as ordered, and use external pneumatic compression devices and thigh-high antiembolism stockings Perform dressing changes as needed using aseptic technique; the wound may be left uncovered after draining ceases Encourage the patient to perform foot and ankle exercises, including dorsifl exion and plantar fl exion, to increase venous return and prevent thrombophlebitis Teach the patient about proper use of a walker and use of the prescribed amount of weight bearing Gout /H18546Description Gout is an infl ammatory arthritis caused by uric acid and crystal deposits that trigger an immune response Gout results when uric acid crystallizes in blood or body fl uids and the precipitate accumulates in connective tissue (tophi) The disorder is characterized by red, swollen, and acutely painful joints; it mostly affects the feet, great toe, ankle, and midfoot The patient may remain symptom-free for years between attacks The rst acute attack strikes suddenly and peaks quickly Med-Surg_Chap11.indd 200 Med-Surg_Chap11.indd 200 8/3/2011 7:39:13 pain Chronic polyarticular gout\u2014the nal, unremitting stage of the disease\u2014is marked by persistent, painful polyarthritis Causes of primary gout include decreased renal excretion of uric acid or oversecretion of uric acid; a genetic defect in purine metabolism (hyperuricemia); radical dieting practices that involve starvation; a diet high in red organ meats, seafood, or high-fructose corn syrup; and high alcohol consumption, especially of beer Secondary gout is associated with certain drugs (such as thiazide diuretics and polycythemia, renal disease, and hypercholesterolemia Primary gout is more common in men than women and typically occurs between ages 30 and 60 Complications include renal calculi, atherosclerotic disease, cardiovascular lesions, and neuropathies /H18546Signs and symptoms Symptoms of an acute attack appear suddenly and peak quickly; initially, one or a few joints are affected with such symptoms as pain, redness, tenderness, and warmth and infl ammation at the affected joint; low-grade fever may also occur Symptoms may subside quickly but tend to recur at irregular intervals; severe attacks can persist for days or weeks In later stages of the disease after polyarticular gout has developed, polyarthritis develops in mul- tiple joints, and subcutaneous tophi (urate crystal deposits) may occur The skin over tophi may ulcerate and release a chalky white exudate or pus /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Serum uric acid levels and WBC count are elevated during an acute gout attack; urine uric acid levels are chronically elevated in about 20% of patients X-ray of the articular cartilage and subchondral bone shows evidence of chronic gout Needle aspiration of synovial fl uid shows needlelike intracellular crystals and an elevated WBC count Treatment aims to bring acute attacks under control, reduce hyperuricemia, and prevent complications Dietary restrictions include avoiding alcohol, eating purine-rich foods (such as anchovies, liver, and sardines) sparingly, and increasing fl uid intake during acute attacks Drug treatment includes the use of NSAIDs such as indomethacin (Indocin) for pain Colchicine helps stop acute attacks Corticosteroids may also be used Allopurinol, febuxostat, probenecid, and sul npyrazone are used to treat chronic gout /H18546Nursing interventions Institute bed rest during the initial phases of an acute attack, focusing on resting the affected joint Use a bed cradle, if appropriate, to prevent irritation of and pressure on the affected area Administer prescribed drugs, including colchicine, within 24 hours of the onset of an acute attack Provide comfort measures and pain relief as needed If the patient can tolerate it, encourage liberal fl uid intake Work with the patient to identify techniques and activities that promote rest and relaxation Provide dietary recommendations, review the patient's diet history for high-purine foods, help the patient select appropriate foods, and provide a low-purine diet Monitor the patient's serum uric acid levels and fl uid balance, including intake and output Teach the patient and his family about the disorder and its treatment, and provide support Lower back pain /H18546Description Lower back pain is pain that occurs in the lumbar region of the back Lower back pain affects most of the population at some time Most lower back pain is musculoskeletal; other common causes are degeneration and disk disease Risk factors for lower back pain include obesity, poor body mechanics, lifting of heavy objects, and lack of exercise or physical activity /H18546Signs and symptoms Med-Surg_Chap11.indd 7:39:13 PM202 Musculoskeletal disorders The patient reports lower back pain, which may radiate to one or both legs Associated symptoms include impaired bladder and bowel function, paresthesia, and reduced motor function /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis is based on patient history, physical examination, and radiographic procedures, including X-rays, CT scan, MRI, myelogram, electromyogram, diskogram, and somatosensory evoked potentials An NSAID and an analgesic are administered for pain, and muscle relaxants may be used to relieve muscle spasms Epidural injections with a steroid may help decrease swelling and infl ammation of spinal nerves Short-term bed rest may be indicated initially Physical therapy, ultrasound, heat or ice, whirlpool, and cognitive-behavioral therapy may be helpful Surgical intervention may include discectomy, discotomy, laminectomy, and spinal fusion /H18546Preoperative nursing interventions Help the patient achieve a comfortable position; elevate the head of the bed 30 degrees, and have the patient fl ex his hips and knees slightly Alternate the application of cold and heat, and administer an analgesic as indicated Teach the patient the proper use of assistive devices Demonstrate proper body mechanics to the patient /H18546Postoperative nursing interventions Assess the patient's vital signs and level of pain; administer medications as ordered; teach the patient how to use patient-controlled analgesia if appropriate Keep the head of the bed fl at or elevated no more than 45 degrees for at least 24 hours after surgery; logroll the patient as indicated Maintain activity restrictions Assist the surgeon with the initial dressing change Monitor the patient's intake and output Assess the surgical wound and dressings; perform incision site care and dressing changes as appropriate Monitor for drainage and bleeding Monitor for cerebrospinal fl uid leakage Assess the patient's motor and neurologic function; compare the results with baseline ndings Osteoarthritis /H18546Description Osteoarthritis is a noninfl ammatory joint disease characterized by degenerative changes in the articu- lar cartilage; it primarily affects weight-bearing joints in the hips, knees, and vertebrae but may also affect the ankles, shoulders, wrists, ngers, and toes Osteoarthritis affects more than 50 million American men and women, primarily those older than age 45 Osteoarthritis has been associated with aging, obesity, and wear and tear on the joints; however, a defective gene may account for many cases of idiopathic osteoarthritis Osteoarthritis may be idiopathic (occurring without a previous injury or known cause) or secondary (resulting from another injury or disease) Both types of osteoarthritis begin with the breakdown of the hyaline cartilage covering the ends of the bones on either side of the joint; the underlying bones become roughened, and bone cysts, ssures, or spurs develop on the bone surface; eventually, the joint space is lost as cartilage loss increases, and the joint ROM is progressively restricted Pain in the affected joints is caused by infl amed synovium, stretching of the joint capsule or liga- ments, irritation of nerve endings in the periosteum, and muscle spasms /H18546Signs and symptoms Joint stiffness and soreness may be accompanied by dull, aching pain that worsens with joint use and weight bearing; rest may relieve the pain ROM is decreased, and crepitus may be felt with joint movement Med-Surg_Chap11.indd 202 Med-Surg_Chap11.indd 202 8/3/2011 7:39:13 PM Heberden's (bony outgrowths on the distal interphalangeal joints) nodes (bony outgrowths on the proximal interphalangeal joints); the joints may also appear enlarged and edematous Bone spurs may press on peripheral nerves, causing numbness or paralysis and hypoesthesia of the arms, forearms, hands, legs, and feet Carpal tunnel syndrome and tarsal tunnel syndrome may result from pressure of bony growths on nerves Gait analysis may show a discrepancy in leg length and joint alignments /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Patient history, physical examination, X-rays, CT scan, MRI, arthrocentesis, arthrogram, and bone scan may be ordered; serologic studies, including complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate creatinine level, mineral assays, and humoral tests for immunoglobulins, also may be performed The patient may require support and stabilization of the joint, with a cane, crutches, a walker, braces, a cervical collar, or traction Weight reduction is encouraged in an obese patient Moist heat and paraf n dips are applied as needed; ice packs may also be used Massage may be helpful ROM exercises are performed for all joints, balancing rest with exercise Properly tted shoes are used to help maintain correct posture, decrease pressure on affected tissues, and increase ambulation Medications such as salicylates, NSAIDs, acetaminophen, muscle relaxants, and intra-articular ste- roids may be prescribed to relieve soreness (systemic steroids aren't used to treat osteoarthritis because it isn't primarily an infl ammatory disease) Studies indicate that glucosamine and chondroitin may be useful in controlling symptoms and reducing functional impairment Viscosupplementation\u2014the injection of gel-like substances into the affected joint\u2014may be helpful Surgery is considered when other treatments have failed; total or partial joint replacement, joint fusion (arthrodesis), or osteotomy may be performed /H18546Nursing interventions Explain the proposed treatment regimen to the patient Apply heat, cold, or other ordered treatments to the joint Administer medications as prescribed Consult a physical therapist about exercise and other treatments Help the patient achieve a comfortable position, using pillows as needed, to promote rest Teach the patient how to use an ambulatory aid; walkers, canes, and other aids decrease weight on the affected joints and help to minimize cartilage erosion; teach proper body mechanics to prevent injury Encourage the patient to perform ADL s when possible to maintain muscle strength and joint ROM Provide skin care to maintain skin integrity Osteomyelitis /H18546Description Osteomyelitis is an acute or a chronic infection of the bone or bone marrow The acute form may result from an infection in other tissues (hematogenic osteomyelitis) or from an open fracture with bacterial contamination The chronic form may result from inadequate initial antimicrobial therapy or lack of response to treatment (relapse occurs when the patient's resistance is lowered) The metaphyseal area in long bones is usually affected; the longer and larger the bone, the more sus- ceptible it is to osteomyelitis; such bones include the femur, tibia, humerus, and vertebrae Common pathogenic organisms are Staphylococcus 90% the pathogens locate in the metaphysis, they grow and reproduce until they have formed a mass; leukocytes help wall off and localize the infection; bone cells in the area die, and purulent matter spreads along the bone, eventually penetrating through the tissues to the skin surface /H18546Signs and symptoms The patient may complain of site pain and pressure; heat, edema, and tenderness may also be present Associated systemic signs and symptoms include chills, fever, malaise, nausea, and tachycardia The affected limb may be sore with use An open, draining area may appear /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis may be based on patient history, bone scan, MRI, physical examination, X-rays of the involved bone, culture of the drainage, WBC count, and ESR An antibiotic is administered I.V. in large doses after blood cultures are taken Aspirin or acetaminophen is given to control fever and pain Tetanus toxoid or antitoxin is given if the patient has an open wound Hyperbaric oxygen treatments at twice the atmospheric pressure for 2 hours/day up to six times per week may be prescribed After antibiotic therapy is completed, the bone is surgically scraped to clear away the dead bone and residue of infection Bone grafts may be used to aid bone healing and prevent fracture Tubes or catheters may be inserted to fl ush the site with an antibiotic to clear any residual organisms An external xator may be placed above and below the osteomyelitic site to decrease the possibility of bone fracture Surgery to drain infection may be necessary Immobilization of the infected bone may be necessary using a cast, traction, or bed rest /H18546Nursing interventions Monitor the type and amount of pain to determine the disease's status Administer an antibiotic, an analgesic, or tetanus toxoid or antitoxin as prescribed Administer I.V. fl uids to maintain hydration Perform neurovascular checks, and monitor vital signs Use strict aseptic technique when required; the patient is more susceptible to additional infection or nosocomial infection Help the patient achieve a comfortable position to relieve pressure on the affected tissues Encourage the patient to perform ROM exercises for all unaffected tissues and joints to maintain strength Teach the patient how to use an ambulatory aid (or arm sling) Discuss concerns about the length and types of treatment Provide and encourage diversionary activities to help the patient maintain a positive outlook Osteoporosis /H18546Description Osteoporosis is a systemic disease in which bone density and bone mass decrease because of a distur- bance in the balance between bone resorption and bone deposition Osteoporosis begins to develop after age 30 but progresses rapidly in postmenopausal women; 70% of women older than age 45 have osteoporosis Causes of osteoporosis include menopausal decreases in estrogen, family history, immobility, insuf- cient intake of calcium and vitamin D, alcohol use, smoking, corticosteroid use, and caffeine intake Patients with osteoporosis are susceptible to fractures (particularly of the femur, radius, and ulna) and compression or crush injuries of the vertebrae /H18546Signs and symptoms Pain may affect the lower back or thoracic spinal area A loss of height may occur Med-Surg_Chap11.indd 204 Med-Surg_Chap11.indd 204 dowager's hump, may be present A minor twist or turn can cause a sudden fracture Numbness or tingling in arms or legs may occur /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis may be based on patient history, physical examination, dual photon absorptiometry, and CT scans Calcium intake is increased to 1,500 mg daily Estrogen and progesterone are prescribed to restore hormonal balance Calcitonin and bisphosphonates (etidronate and panidronate) alendronate, ibandronate, raloxifene, and risedronate are also used to treat osteoporosis Back or neck supports are used to prevent stress fractures Active exercises are encouraged to help retain calcium in the bones /H18546Nursing interventions Monitor the amount and type of pain to determine its extent Give an analgesic as prescribed to relieve pain and promote mobility Teach the patient how to use an ambulatory aid to maintain mobility, and apply a neck or back sup- port, if ordered Teach the patient about dietary sources of calcium and calcium supplements; increased calcium intake decreases the risk of fractures Refer the patient to a practitioner for possible estrogen replacement therapy (controversial) Discuss methods of dressing to camoufl age kyphosis Discuss how to ensure a safe home environment to decrease the risk of falls, for example, by remov- ing loose rugs and avoiding long, uncovered electrical cords Encourage the patient to participate in active, weight-bearing exercises, such as walking and swim- ming, to maintain calcium in bones and preserve muscle strength Encourage the patient to modify lifestyle choices by avoiding smoking, alcohol, caffeine, and carbon- ated beverages, and increasing protein intake Rhabdomyolysis /H18546Description Rhabdomyolysis is the breakdown of muscle tissue and may cause myoglobinuria Muscle tissue breakdown usually follows muscle trauma, especially a crush injury The disorder may lead to renal failure if not treated Causes of rhabdomyolysis, besides trauma, are excessive muscle activity (such as status epilepticus or severe dystonia), familial tendency, infection, medications (such serotonin reuptake inhibitors), and sporadic strenuous exertion (for example, running in a marathon) /H18546Signs and symptoms Tenderness, swelling, and muscle weakness result from muscle trauma and pressure Dark, reddish brown urine is caused by myoglobin release /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis is based on patient history that reveals myalgias or muscle pain; physical examination; elevated levels potassium, and creatinine; and CT scan, MRI, and bone scintigraphy, which detect muscle necrosis Treatment should focus on the underlying cause I.V. crystalloids may be given to increase intravascular volume and glomerular ltration rate Diuretics may be given Dialysis may be required Analgesics may be given for pain Med-Surg_Chap11.indd 7:39:13 PM 8/3/2011 disorders If compartment syndrome develops and venous pressure is greater than 25 mm Hg, immediate fasci- otomy and debridement may be needed to relieve pressure and prevent tissue death Urine alkalinization and osmotic or loop diuretics may be implemented to prevent renal failure /H18546Nursing interventions Administer I.V. fl uids and diuretics to reduce nephrotoxicity Monitor intake and output Recommend exercise modi cation to prevent recurrence of rhadomyolysis Tumors, bone /H18546Description Neoplasms of the musculoskeletal system are of various types, including osteogenic, chondrogenic, brogenic, and bone marrow cell tumors Bone tumors may be primary or metastatic from primary cancers elsewhere in the body; metastatic bone tumors occur more commonly than primary bone tumors Benign bone tumors include osteochondromas, bone cysts, osteoid osteomas, and bromas; benign tumors are slow growing, encapsulated, present few signs and symptoms, and are rarely associated with mortality Giant cell tumors may begin as benign tumors and remain that way for long periods; they have the potential to eventually become malignant Primary malignant bone tumors are relatively rare; several types exist, including sarcomas (such and brosarcoma), Ewing's sarcoma, chordoma (see Types of primary malignant bone tumors ) Primary malignant bone tumors can be osseous (arising from the bony structure itself) or nonosseous (arising from hematopoietic, vascular, and neural tissues) chondrosarcoma (chondroblastic), Ewing's sarcoma, brosarcoma ( broblastic), and chordoma The exact causes of bone tumors are unknown, but they may be related to exposure to carcinogens, hereditary factors, and trauma Bone cancers affect males and females equally; they occur more commonly in children and adoles- cents, although some types do occur in patients ages 35 to 60 years The most common sites for tumors are the femur, tibia, and humerus /H18546Signs and symptoms General symptoms include persistent, localized dull bone pain on weight bearing and at rest, unex- plained weight loss, impaired mobility, and a history of pathologic fracture Physical ndings include swelling and tenderness at the affected site, a palpable bony or soft tissue mass, and an abnormal gait /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Bone X-rays, radioisotope bone and computed tomography (CT) scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) all aid in diagnosis Incision or aspiration biopsy con rms primary malignancy Treatment depends on the type of tumor /H18546Nursing interventions Encourage communication, and help the patient set realistic goals Give prescribed I.V. infusions and medications; administer antinausea agents to minimize nausea Provide small, frequent meals Provide comfort measures to facilitate the administration of chemotherapy as indicated Prepare the patient and family for possible surgery, including limb salvage and associated care Offer support to the patient and family about the condition and effects of treatment, such as loss of part of a limb Obtain blood specimens as ordered to evaluate for bone marrow suppression secondary to chemotherapy Monitor vital signs and the neurovascular status of the affect extremity 7:39:13 PM 8/3/2011 7:39:13 PMTumors, bone 207 The chart below lists primary malignant bone tumors of both osseous and nonosseous origin, including their clinical features and treatment. Type Clinical features Treatment Osseous origin Chondrosarcoma Develops from cartilage Painless; grows slowly but is locally recurrent and invasive Occurs most commonly in pelvis, proximal femur, ribs, and shoulder girdle Usually occurs in the very young and the very old Hemipelvectomy, surgical resection (ribs) Radiation (palliative) Chemotherapy Malignant giant cell tumor Arises from benign giant cell tumor Found most commonly in long bones, especially in the knee area Usually occurs in people ages 18 to 50 Curettage Total excision Radiation for recurrent disease Osteogenic sarcoma Osteoid tumor present in bone specimen Tumor arises from bone-forming osteoblast and bone-digesting osteoclast Occurs most commonly in humerus; occasionally, in bula, ileum, vertebra, or mandible Usually occurs in teens and young adults in their 20s Surgery (tumor resection, high thigh amputation, hemipelvectomy, interscapulothoracic surgery) Chemotherapy Parosteal osteogenic sarcoma Develops on surface of bone instead of interior Progresses slowly Occurs most commonly in distal femur, but also in tibia, humerus, and ulna Usually occurs in people ages 30 to 40 Surgery (tumor resection, possible amputation, interscapulothoracic surgery, hemipelvectomy) Chemotherapy Combination of the above Nonosseous origin Chordoma Derived from embryonic remnants of notochord Progresses slowly Usually found at end of spinal column and in spheno- occipital, sacrococcygeal, and vertebral areas Characterized by constipation and visual disturbances Usually occurs in people ages 50 to 60 Surgical resection (often resulting in neural defects) Radiation (palliative, or when surgery not applicable, as in occipital area) Ewing's sarcoma Originates in bone marrow and invades shafts of long and fl at bones Usually affects lower extremities, most commonly femur, innominate bones, ribs, tibia, humerus, vertebra, and bula; may metastasize to lungs Pain increasingly severe and persistent Usually occurs in children, teens, and young adults in their early 20s Has a poor prognosis High-voltage radiation (tumor is radiosensitive) Chemotherapy to slow growth Amputation only if there's no evidence of metastasis Fibrosarcoma Relatively rare Originates in brous tissue of bone Invades long or fl at bones (femur, tibia, mandible) but also involves periosteum and overlying muscle Usually occurs in people ages 30 to 40 Amputation Radiation Chemotherapy Bone grafts (with low-grade brosarcoma)Types of primary malignant bone 7:39:13 PM 8/3/2011 7:39:13 PM208 Musculoskeletal disorders Teach the patient and family about the disorder, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, including the need for surgery and possible follow-up chemotherapy Teach about the use of assistive devices or prostheses and modi cations, as needed Provide support and encouragement, and refer the patient and family to support services as needed Review questions 1. A patient in balanced suspension traction for a fractured femur needs to be repositioned toward the head of the bed. During repositioning, the nurse should: /H18540A. place slight additional tension on the traction cords. /H18540B. release the weights, and replace them immediately after positioning. /H18540C. lift the traction and the patient during repositioning. /H18540D. maintain the same degree of traction tension. Correct answer: D Traction is used to reduce the fracture and must be maintained at all times, includ- ing during repositioning. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because it isn't appropriate to increase trac-tion tension or release or lift the traction during repositioning. 2. A patient undergoes cast placement for a fractured left radius. The nurse should suspect compartment syn- drome if the patient experiences pain that: /H18540A. intensi es with the elevation of the left arm. /H18540B. disappears with the fl exion of the left arm. /H18540C. increases with the arm in a dependent position. /H18540D. radiates up the arm to the left scapula. Correct answer: A Pain is the most common symptom of compartment syndrome. Because the pain is the result of ischemia, elevating the limb reduces circulation, worsens the ischemia, and intensi es the pain. Options B and C are incorrect because these positions don't alter the pain of compartment syn-drome. Option D is incorrect because the pain of compartment syndrome doesn't radiate up the arm to the scapula. 3. A patient received a right hip prosthesis after a fall. In the immediate postoperative period, the nurse should: /H18540A. maintain the leg in an adducted position. /H18540B. maintain the leg in an abducted position. /H18540C. maintain the leg in a neutral position. /H18540D. maintain the leg with the hip fl exed greater than 90 degrees. Correct answer: B After receiving a hip prosthesis, the affected leg should be kept abducted. Adduc- tion (Option A) may dislocate the hip. Option C would be correct if an internal xation device was used. Option D is incorrect because the hip must not be fl exed more than 90 degrees for the rst 2 months and even less than that for the rst 10 days. 4. A 78-year-old patient has a history of osteoarthritis. Which signs and symptoms would the nurse expect to nd on physical assessment? /H18540A. Joint Tophi, enlarged joints, nodes Swelling, joint 209 Correct answer: A Signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis include joint pain, crepitus, Heberden's nodes, Bouchard's nodes, and enlarged joints. Joint pain occurs with movement and is relieved by rest. As the disease progresses, pain may also occur at rest. Heberden's nodes are bony growths that occur at the distal interphalangeal joints. Bouchard's nodes involve the proximal interphalangeal joints. Hot, infl amed joints (Option B) rarely occur with osteoarthritis. Tophi (Option C) are deposits of sodium urate crystals that occur with chronic gout, not osteoarthritis. Swelling, joint pain, and tenderness on palpation (Option D) occur with a sprain injury. 5. The nurse is caring for an elderly female patient who has osteoporosis. When teaching her, the nurse should include information about which major complication? /H18540A. Bone fracture /H18540B. Loss of estrogen /H18540C. Negative calcium balance /H18540D. Scoliosis Correct answer: A Bone fracture is a major complication of osteoporosis that results when loss of cal- cium and phosphate increases the fragility of bones. Option B is incorrect because estrogen de ciencies result from menopause, not osteoporosis. Option C is wrong because calcium and vitamin D supple-ments may be used to support normal bone metabolism, but a negative calcium balance isn't a complica-tion of osteoporosis. Option D is incorrect because, although the cause of scoliosis is unknown, it's not thought to be a complication of osteoporosis. 6. Conservative treatment of a herniated nucleus pulposus would include which measures? /H18540A. Surgery /H18540B. Spinal fusion /H18540C. Bed rest, pain medication, and physiotherapy /H18540D. Strenuous exercise, pain medication, and physiotherapy Correct answer: C Conservative treatment of a herniated nucleus pulposus may include bed rest, pain medication, and physiotherapy. Aggressive, not conservative, treatment may include surgery (Option A), including spinal fusion (Option B). A regimen of strenuous exercise, pain medication, and physiotherapy (Option D) isn't recommended. 7. Which areas should be included in a neurovascular assessment? /H18540A. Orientation, movement, pulses, and warmth /H18540B. Capillary ll time, movement, pulses, and warmth /H18540C. Orientation, pupillary response, temperature, and pulses /H18540D. Respiratory pattern, orientation, pulses, and temperature Correct answer: B A correct neurovascular assessment should include capillary re ll time, movement, pulses, and warmth. Neurovascular assessment involves nerve and blood supply to an area. Orientation, pupillary response, temperature, and respiratory pattern (Options A, C, and D) aren't part of a 8. Which of the following are considered signs and symptoms of a fracture? /H18540A. Tingling, coolness, and loss of sensation, redness, and coolness /H18540C. Coolness, redness, and a new pain site /H18540D. Discoloration, deformity, and pain at the site of injury Correct answer: D Signs of a fracture may include discoloration, deformity, and pain at the site of injury. Tingling, coolness (included in Options A, B, and C), and loss of pulses are signs of a vascular problem. 9. What diagnostic test would be used to evaluate the presence of or urine myoglobin test indicates rhabdomyolysis. A glycosylated hemoglobin test (Option A) measures the amount of glycosylated hemoglobin in the blood and is used to monitor blood sugar. Serum troponin (Option B) is used to detect acute coronary syndrome. A bone biopsy (Option D) would be used to diagnose osteoporosis. 10. What complication should the nurse be alert for in a diabetic patient who has been placed in skeletal traction after a motor vehicle collision? Osteoporosis B This patient has a signi cant risk of developing osteomyelitis secondary to the skel- etal pin. Osteoarthritis (Option A) is a degenerative joint disease, osteoporosis (Option C) is a metabolic bone disorder, and osteosarcoma (Option D) is an aggressive form of bone cancer; none occur secondary to skeletal traction. Introduction /H18546The GI, or digestive, system breaks down food and prepares it for absorption by the body's cells; nonabsorbable ingested substances pass through the system and are eliminated as solid waste /H18546Although not part of the alimentary canal, the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas are essential accessory components of the GI system Nursing history /H18546The nurse asks the patient about his chief complaint The patient with a GI problem may report a change in appetite, heartburn, nausea, pain, or vomiting The patient may also report a change in bowel habits, such as constipation, diarrhea, or stool characteristics /H18546The nurse then questions the patient about his present illness Ask the patient about his symptom, including when it started, associated symptoms, location, radiation, intensity, duration, frequency, and precipitating and alleviating factors Ask about the use of prescription and over-the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, and vitamin and nutritional supplements; ask about the use of laxatives If the patient's chief complaint is diarrhea, nd out if he recently traveled abroad Ask the patient about changes in appetite and in bowel habits (e.g., a change in the amount, appear- ance, or color of his stool or the appearance of blood in it) and dif culty eating or chewing /H18546The nurse asks about medical history Question the patient about other GI disorders, such as gallbladder disease, GI bleeding, infl amma- tory bowel disease, or ulcers Also, ask about previous abdominal surgery or trauma /H18546The nurse then assesses the family history Ask about a family history of diseases with a hereditary link, such as alcoholism, colon cancer, Crohn's disease, stomach ulcers, and ulcerative colitis Also, question the patient about a family history of chronic diseases /H18546The nurse obtains a social history Ask about work, exercise, diet, use of recreational drugs and alcohol, caffeine intake, and hobbies Also ask about stress, support systems, and coping mechanisms /H18546Physical assessment When assessing the abdomen, use this sequence: inspection, auscultation, percussion, and palpation; palpating or percussing the abdomen before you auscultate can change the character of the patient's bowel sounds and lead to an inaccurate assessment The nurse begins with inspection Observe the patient's general appearance, and note his behavior Inspect the skin for turgor, color, and texture; note abnormalities such as bruising, decreased axillary or pubic hair, edema, petechiae, scars, spider angiomas, and stretch marks Observe the patient's head for color of the sclerae, sunken eyes, dentures, caries, lesions, breath odor, and tongue color, swelling, or drynessGastrointestinal disordersGastrointestinal disorders PM212 Gastrointestinal disorders Check the size and shape of the abdomen, noting distention, peristalsis, pulsations, contour, visible masses, and protrusions Observe the rectal area for abnormalities The nurse continues by using auscultation Note the character and quality of bowel sounds in each quadrant Auscultate the abdomen for vascular sounds Then the nurse percusses the abdomen Percuss the abdomen to detect the size and location of the abdominal organs Note the presence of air or fl uid Next, the nurse uses palpation Palpate the abdomen to determine the size, shape, position, and tenderness of major abdominal organs and to detect masses and fl uid accumulation Note abdominal muscle tone and tenderness Palpate the rectum, noting any abnormalities Appendicitis infl ammation, which temporarily obstructs the appendix In this disorder, bacteria multiply and infl ammation and pressure increase, restricting blood fl ow and causing thrombus and abdominal pain Causes include fecal mass (fecalith), foreign body obstruction, barium ingestion, neoplasm, stricture, and infection Appendicitis is the most common major abdominal surgical disease If left untreated, it can be fatal; gangrene and perforation can develop within 36 hours with resulting peritonitis and sepsis /H18546Signs and symptoms Appendicitis causes abdominal periumbilical pain that's initially generalized and then localizes in the right lower abdomen (McBurney's point) The patient feels right lower quadrant and rebound tenderness; he may continually adjust his posture to relieve pain and exhibits guarding The patient may display the Rovsing sign (pain in the right lower quadrant that occurs with palpation of left lower quadrant), psoas sign (abdominal pain that occurs when fl exing the hip when pressure is applied to the knee), or obturator sign (abdominal pain that occurs when the hip is rotated) A patient with a retrocele or pelvic appendix may not have abdominal or fl ank tenderness Other signs and symptoms include anorexia, nausea, and vomiting; low-grade fever; and tachycardia /H18546Diagnosis and treatment White blood cell (WBC) count may be elevated, with an increase in immature cells Ultrasonography of the abdomen can help diagnose a nonperforated appendix; a computed tomography (CT) scan can also be useful Appendectomy is only effective treatment /H18546Nursing interventions Place the patient in Fowler's position to minimize pain Before surgery, administer analgesics judiciously because they may mask pain or perforation Prepare the patient for appendectomy; initiate nothing-by-mouth status and establish I.V. access; administer I.V. fl uids to prevent dehydration After appendectomy, watch for surgical complications, including wound infection, intestinal obstruction, peritonitis, and abdominal abscess Administer pain medication as needed If the patient has developed peritonitis, administer antibiotics and maintain a nasogastric (NG) tube Monitor the patient's vital signs closely Increase the patient's activity and advance his diet as tolerated Med-Surg_Chap12.indd 212 Colorectal cancer is caused by a malignant tumor of the colon or rectum; it's the third most common site of new cancer diagnoses and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women It almost always involves adenocarcinomas; about half are sessile lesions of rectosigmoid area; all others are polypoid lesions that begin as benign polyps and progress to malignancy Tumors in the sigmoid and descending colon undergo circumferential growth and constrict the intestinal lumen Tumors in the ascending colon are usually large at diagnosis and are palpable on physical examination The disease progresses slowly; it has a better prognosis if it's detected early, before nodal involve- ment Although the causes of colorectal cancer are unknown, risk factors include excessive intake of satu- rated fat; a history of ulcerative colitis, polyps, or infl ammatory bowel disease; a family history of colon cancer; a low- ber diet; obesity; and alcohol or tobacco use; those over age 50 have a higher risk Complications include partial or complete bowel obstruction and extension of the tumor into surrounding blood vessels, resulting in hemorrhage; perforation, abscess formation, peritonitis, sepsis, and death may occur /H18546Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms depend on the location of the tumor and the extent of the disease; they often don't develop until cancer is at an advanced stage Early-stage right colon tumors typically don't cause signs and symptoms because stool is liquid in the right part of the colon Left colon tumors cause abdominal pain, cramping, narrowed stools, constipation, and bright red blood in stools The most common sign is a change in bowel habits, with passage of blood in the stool; black, tarry stools; cramping; straining; diarrhea; and constipation Other signs and symptoms include unexplained anemia, fatigue, weight loss, and dull abdominal pain The patient may have abdominal distention or visible or palpable masses as well as abdominal tenderness /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Digital rectal examination detects almost 15% of colorectal cancers; speci cally, it can be used to detect suspicious rectal and perianal lesions A fecal occult blood test may be positive Iron de ciency anemia may be present Colonoscopy and biopsy con rm the diagnosis A CT scan allows for staging; transrectal ultrasonography determines the extent of rectal lesions Surgery is the primary treatment Resection or right hemicolectomy is the treatment for advanced disease; surgery may include resection of the terminal segment of the ileum, cecum, ascending colon, and right half of the transverse colon with corresponding mesentery Right colectomy includes the transverse colon and mesentery corresponding to midcolic vessels, or segmental resection of the transverse colon midcolic vessels Abdominoperineal resection and permanent sigmoid colostomy may be performed Chemotherapy and radiation therapy may also be used /H18546Nursing interventions Provide physical and emotional support; allow the patient to verbalize his feelings about the condition, and discuss appropriate coping strategies Give prescribed drugs, laxatives, enemas, and antibiotics preoperatively, as ordered Prepare the patient for surgery; ensure patent I.V. access and administer I.V. fl uids After surgery, signs and fl uid and electrolyte balance; be alert for signs of a leaking anastomosis, including fever and abdominal pain Advance the patient's diet as indicated, and provide adequate nutrition Before discharge, help the patient modify his diet; encourage him to avoid irritating foods, caffeine, and alcohol Teach the patient and family about the disorder, treatment, and follow-up care Cancer, esophageal /H18546Description Two types of esophageal cancer exist: adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma Risk factors include chronic esophageal irritation such as occurs with gastroesophageal refl ux disease (GERD), alcohol and tobacco use, chronic ingestion of hot liquids, and nutritional de ciencies Cancer of the esophagus occurs more often in men than in women and more often in blacks than in whites; the incidence is much higher in other parts of the world, especially China and the Middle East Tumors can spread through the esophageal mucosa and extend into the lymphatics, with possible mediastinal perforation and erosion of the great vessels /H18546Signs and symptoms Esophageal obstruction causes dysphagia, initially with solid foods and eventually with liquids Throat discomfort is common, along with a feeling of substernal pain or fullness, regurgitation of ingested food, and hiccups rm the diagnosis; CT and positron emission tomography (PET) scans help identify invasive disease and metastases Treatment depends on the stage of disease at diagnosis; in early diagnosis, treatment aims to cure the disease; treatment in later stages is mainly palliative Treatment options include combinations of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation Resection of the esophagus is possible, with a jejunal graft placed to provide esophageal continuity; a possible complication of this surgery is a leaking anastomosis Palliative treatment seeks to keep the esophagus open through dilation, stent placement, and radiation or chemotherapy /H18546Nursing interventions Preoperatively, optimize the patient's nutritional status, providing enteral or parenteral nutrition if necessary Postoperative care is similar to other thoracic surgeries; place the patient in low-Fowler's position to minimize gastric refl ux and monitor for signs of aspiration Monitor the patient's vital signs and cardiac rhythm; atrial brillation can occur because of the proximity of the heart and great vessels to the surgical area; administer antiarrhythmics as ordered An NG tube may remain in place for several days; maintain its patency, and provide skin care and comfort measures Advance the patient's diet and activity as indicated; provide adequate nutrition for wound healing Educate the patient and family about the disease and treatment, and provide emotional support Cancer, gastric /H18546Description Most gastric cancers are adenocarcinomas that can occur anywhere in the stomach; at the time of diagnosis, the tumor has usually in ltrated the surrounding mucosa and penetrated the wall of the stomach and adjacent organs and structures The consumption of smoked, salted, and pickled foods seems to have an association with the development of gastric cancer Other risk factors include chronic infl ammation of the stomach, Helicobacter pylori infection and gastric ulcers, smoking, achlorhydria, and Med-Surg_Chap12.indd 214 8/2/2011 2:54:27 PM 8/2/2011 2:54:27 PMCholecystitis 215 Most cases are discovered late in the disease process, resulting in a poor prognosis Patients are usually diagnosed between the ages of 40 and 70; men have a higher incidence than women Although the incidence in the United States is decreasing, gastric cancer accounts for more than 11,000 deaths annually; the incidence is much greater in other countries, especially Japan /H18546Signs and symptoms Early symptoms are nonspeci c and include pain relieved by antacids Symptoms of progressive disease include dyspepsia, a constant feeling of fullness, bloating after meals, weight loss, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, and abdominal pain Ascites and hepatomegaly can be seen in advanced disease /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Endoscopy and biopsy con rm the diagnosis; barium studies, X-rays, and CT scans can further evaluate the extent of the tumor Surgical excision is the treatment of choice for well localized tumors; in more advanced disease, excision of the tumor may be palliative and relieve obstruction Partial or total gastric resections can be performed; with a total gastrectomy, the GI tract is recon- structed by anastomosing the end of the jejunum to the end of the esophagus Chemotherapy may follow surgical treatment /H18546Nursing interventions Provide physical and emotional support; allow the patient to verbalize his feelings about the condition, and discuss appropriate coping strategies Give prescribed drugs, such as antacids and histamine-2 receptor antagonists Prepare the patient for surgery; ensure patent I.V. access and administer I.V. fl uids After surgery, provide appropriate postoperative care Monitor the patient's vital signs and fl uid and electrolyte balance; be alert for signs of a leaking anastomosis, including fever and abdominal pain Advance the patient's diet as indicated; be alert for signs of dumping syndrome and adjust the patient's diet to reduce these signs Before discharge, help the patient modify his diet; encourage him to avoid irritating foods, caffeine, and alcohol Teach the patient and family about the disorder, treatment, and follow-up care Cholecystitis /H18546Description Cholecystitis is an acute or a chronic infl ammation of the gallbladder; it's commonly associated with cholelithiasis (presence of gallstones) In most cases, cholecystitis is caused by gallstones; bacterial infection plays a minor role in acute cho- lecystitis; secondary, bacterial infection occurs in approximately 50% of cases /H18546Signs and symptoms Sharp abdominal pain may affect the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, especially after ingestion of fatty foods, and may be referred to the right shoulder area Other GI effects include abdominal tenderness and muscle rigidity on palpation, eructation, fl atu- lence, nausea, and vomiting Fever may result from acute infection Positive Murphy's sign (painful inspiration due to severe tenderness) may be present Jaundice may occur if gallstones obstruct the common bile duct /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis is based on ultrasonography of the upper abdomen and oral cholecystography that shows an enlarged gallbladder and gallstones Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography supports the diagnosis of obstructive jaundice and reveals calculi in the ducts aminotransferase, cholesterol, and total bilirubin are elevated The patient is placed on a low-fat diet An anticholinergic, such as propantheline or dicyclomine, is given to decrease spasms of the common bile duct An analgesic is prescribed for pain An antibiotic may be given to prevent or treat infection Chenodeoxycholic acid or ursodeoxycholic acid may be administered to dissolve gallstones; it must be taken for 6 to 12 months to be effective If pain persists, the gallbladder and gallstones are surgically removed by means of laparoscopic microsurgery or abdominal laparotomy; lithotripsy may also be performed to break up gallstones using ultrasonic waves /H18546Preoperative nursing interventions Monitor the patient for abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant that may radiate to the right shoulder Check the skin and conjunctivae for jaundice /H18546Postoperative nursing interventions Monitor vital signs every 1 to 2 hours for 4 to 8 hours and then every 4 hours to detect fl uid imbal- ances, hemorrhage, or shock Monitor bowel sounds every 4 hours and bowel output to determine return of GI functions Check the wound area for signs of bleeding and infl ammation Change the wound dressing as needed; the wound may be left uncovered if no drainage is present Monitor drainage from the T tube, if present; a T tube is used if gallstones were in the common bile duct because it lets bile pass into the small intestine and decreases duct infl ammation Administer an opioid analgesic every 4 hours as needed and I.V. antibiotics every 6 to 8 hours as pre- scribed to maintain comfort and prevent infection Make sure the patient maintains nothing-by-mouth status as prescribed; administer I.V. fl uids (up to 3,000 mL daily) to maintain fl uid balance, also monitor fl uid intake and output every 8 hours Start giving the patient clear liquids, then progress to a regular diet as prescribed; fat restrictions may be lifted because gallbladder removal increases the patient's tolerance to fatty foods Help the patient sit on the bed or in a chair and ambulate as prescribed to promote recovery from the surgery Record pertinent data in the patient's chart for continuity of care Cirrhosis of the liver /H18546Description Cirrhosis is a chronic, progressive disease that causes extensive degeneration and destruction of parenchymal liver cells; it's twice as common in men as in women, and most patients are between ages 40 and 60 Common types of cirrhosis include micronodular (La\u00ebnnec's), which is caused by excessive alcohol intake; macronodular (postnecrotic, toxin-induced), which is caused by chemicals, bacteria, and viruses; biliary, which is caused by irritating biliary products; pigment, which is caused by hemochromatosis; and cardiac, which is caused by right-sided heart failure and chronic liver disease /H18546Signs and symptoms GI effects include anorexia, constipation or diarrhea, dull abdominal pain and heaviness, marked fl atulence, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss The liver may be enlarged and have nodules; jaundice and hepatic encephalopathy may occur Hematologic effects may include anemia and thrombocytopenia Fever and malaise may be present Ascites, esophageal varices, and peripheral edema may occur Skin lesions may include petechiae, purpura, and spider angiomas; dry skin and pruritus also 216 8/2/2011 (liver fl ap, a hand-fl apping tremor commonly seen in patients with hepatic coma), lethargy, mental changes, slurred speech, and peripheral neuropathies may occur Endocrine effects may include gynecomastia and impotence in men and amenorrhea in women /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis is based on patient history (especially excessive alcohol intake or hepatitis), physical exam- ination, liver biopsy and liver function studies, ultrasonography, CT scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and serologic studies, including complete blood count (CBC), serum electrolyte levels, and pro-thrombin time (PT) Paracentesis may be used to remove ascitic fl uid For intractable chronic ascites, a peritoneovenous shunt may be inserted to transfer ascitic fl uid into the venous system for eventual excretion in the urine A potassium-sparing diuretic is used to decrease ascites and peripheral edema An antiemetic is used to reduce nausea and vomiting Vitamin K is used to reduce bleeding tendencies stemming from hypothrombinemia Lactulose is used to treat hepatic encephalopathy; lactulose decreases the pH of the colon, which inhibits the diffusion of ammonia from the colon into the blood Bleeding esophageal varices are treated by administering vasopressin and a beta-adrenergic blocker; performing endoscopic sclerosis; and inserting a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube or various surgical shunts (such as a portacaval shunt) Blood transfusions may be required for massive hemorrhage; I.V. therapy using colloid volume expanders or crystalloids may be given for volume expansion The recommended diet is typically high in calories and has moderate to high protein, moderate to low fat, and low sodium content; fl uids are restricted; protein is restricted if encephalopathy develops /H18546Nursing interventions Make sure the patient maintains bed rest; reposition him every 2 hours to help keep the skin intact and prevent pressure ulcers Encourage active range-of-motion exercises, and use special mattresses to relieve pressure Encourage deep breathing, and listen for breath sounds in all lung lobes Observe closely for changes in behavior or personality, such as stupor, lethargy, hallucinations, or neuromuscular dysfunction Administer an antiemetic as prescribed to control nausea and vomiting Administer a diuretic as prescribed; weigh the patient daily, and measure fl uid intake and output; note signs of hypokalemia Measure abdominal girth, and note changes Check the patient's level of consciousness, neurologic status, and vital signs to detect encephalopathy or developing infection Monitor the patient for bleeding by checking vomitus and stool for blood; apply pressure to injection sites to prevent bleeding Monitor the results of laboratory tests and other studies; report abnormal ndings to the practitioner Consult the dietitian regarding a low-sodium, fl uid-restricted diet; provide four to six small meals daily, including foods that the patient likes, when possible Perform oral hygiene before meals and as needed to prevent stomatitis and remove characteristic fetid or ammonia-like mouth odor; have the patient use a soft toothbrush Provide meticulous skin care to prevent excoriation; check for edema, jaundice, petechiae, pruritus, purpura, spider angiomas, and ulcerations Tell the patient to avoid straining when turning, moving in bed, or defecating to lessen pressure on varices or hemorrhoids Explain upcoming diagnostic tests or treatments as needed Instruct the patient to avoid spicy or irritating foods, nonsteroidal anti-infl ammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and aspirin Discuss patient concerns about the disease and lifestyle or body image change; provide a psychologi- cal referral, if needed PM 8/2/2011 2:54:28 PM218 Gastrointestinal disorders Encourage the use of community agencies or services to help the patient control alcohol intake; stress the importance of abstaining from alcohol Record all data in the patient's chart for continuity of care Diverticular disease /H18546Description Diverticular disease is characterized by diverticula (bulging pouches) in the GI wall that push the mucosal lining through the surrounding muscle There are two clinical forms: diverticulosis (diverticula are present but may cause only mild or no symptoms) and diverticulitis (diverticula are infl amed and may cause potentially fatal obstruction, infection, or hemorrhage) The disorder results from high intraluminal pressure on an area of weakness in the GI wall, where blood vessels enter Retained undigested food and bacteria accumulate in diverticular sac, cutting off the blood supply, and leading to infl amation, perforation, abscess, peritonitis, obstruction, or hemorrhage Causes are defects in the wall strength of the colon, diminished colonic motility and increased intra- luminal pressure, and a low- ber diet /H18546Signs and symptoms In mild diverticulitis, moderate left lower abdominal pain, low-grade fever, and leukocytosis may occur In severe diverticulitis, abdominal rigidity from rupture of the diverticula, abscesses and peritonitis, left lower quadrant pain, high fever, chills, and hypotension from sepsis may occur In chronic diverticulitis, constipation, ribbonlike stools, intermittent diarrhea, abdominal distention resulting from intestinal obstruction, abdominal rigidity and pain, diminishing or absent bowel sounds, and nausea and vomiting secondary to intestinal obstruction may occur /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis may rely on patient history, barium enema, or colonscopy, which reveals diverticula A high-residue diet may be recommended for the treatment of diverticulosis after pain has subsided Antibiotics may be given to treat infection of the diverticula Analgesics may be prescribed to control pain and to relax smooth muscle Colon resection with removal of involved segments may be done to correct refractory cases; a tempo- rary colostomy may be placed to drain abscess and to rest the colon /H18546Nursing interventions Make sure the patient understands the importance of ber in the diet Advise the patient to relieve constipation with stool softeners or bulk-forming cathartics Observe stools for frequency, color, and consistency If bleeding of the diverticulum occurs, the patient may need angiography and placement of a catheter for infusing vasopressin After surgery, watch for signs of infection and bleeding; encourage the patient to cough and breathe deeply Teach the patient how to care for his ostomy Gastroesophageal refl ux disease /H18546Description GERD is the backfl ow of gastric contents or duodenal contents, or both, past the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) into the esophagus without associated belching or vomiting The disorder occurs when the LES pressure is de cient or pressure in the stomach exceeds LES pressure The degree of mucosal injury is based on the amount and concentration of refl uxed gastric acid, proteolytic enzymes, and bile acids Causes include anything that lowers LES pressure, such as alcohol, smoking, hiatal hernia, increased abdominal pressure with obesity or pregnancy, medications (such as morphine, diazepam, calcium Med-Surg_Chap12.indd 218 Med-Surg_Chap12.indd 218 anticholenergic), NG intubation for more than 4 days, and weakened esophageal sphincter /H18546Signs and symptoms Burning pain in the epigastric area, possibly radiating to the arms and chest, results from refl ux of gastric contents into the esophagus Pain, usually after a meal or when lying down, occurs secondary to increased abdominal pressure, causing refl ux Feeling of fl uid accumulation occurs in the throat without a sour or bitter taste because of hyperse- cretion of saliva /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis is based on a patient history that reveals heartburn, physical examination, esophagoscopy, barium swallow, an upper GI series, esophageal acidity testing, and an acid perfusion test Abdominal pressure may be reduced by eating small, frequent meals and not eating before bedtime (see Factors affecting LES pressure ) Patient positioning may be helpful in reducing abdominal pressure and preventing refl ux (for exam- ple, sitting up during and after meal times or sleeping with the head of the bed elevated) Antacids may help to neutralize the acidic content of the stomach Histamine-2 receptor antagonists may be given to inhibit gastric acid secretion Proton pump inhibitors may be prescribed to reduce gastric acidity Cholinergic agents may be given to increase LES pressure Smoking cessation is recommended /H18546Nursing interventions Teach the patient about the causes and symptoms of GERD Tell the patient how to avoid refl ux with an antirefl ux regimen that includes diet, positioning, and antacids Gastrointestinal bleeding /H18546Description Acute GI bleeding can range from minor to severe About 85% of GI bleeding involves the upper GI tract Bleeding may be caused by a disrupted mucosal-epithelial barrier or by a ruptured artery or vein Common conditions leading to GI bleeding include peptic ulcer disease, esophageal varices, diver- ticular disease, tumors, and ulcerative colitisVarious dietary and lifestyle factors can increase or decrease lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure. Take these factors into account when you plan the pa tient's treatment program. Factors that increase LES pressure Factors that decrease LES pressure Protein Carbohydrates Nonfat milk Low-dose ethanol Fat Whole milk Orange juice Tomatoes Antifl atulent (simethicone) Chocolate High-dose ethanol Cigarette smoking Lying on the right or left side Sitting CaffeineFactors affecting LES pressure Med-Surg_Chap12.indd patient may vomit blood or have coffee-ground vomitus Stools may appear bloody, maroon-colored, or black and tarry Abdominal cramping may occur The patient with chronic bleeding may have symptoms of anemia Signs of hypovolemic shock include cold, clammy skin; hypotension; reduced urine output; and tachycardia /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis is based on physical examination and patient history, including previous bleeding abnor- malities, current medications, recent illnesses, and alcohol use Colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy can detect the source of the bleeding Blood tests, such as CBC, coagulation studies, and liver function tests, are also helpful Treatment depends on the location and cause of GI bleeding Blood or blood component replacement may be indicated An NG tube may be inserted and the stomach lavaged with room-temperature fl uid to remove blood and clots from the stomach A Sengstaken-Blakemore tube may be indicated for the treatment of esophageal varices Bleeding blood vessels may be treated with cauterization or endoscopic injection sclerotherapy A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt may be indicated to connect the portal and hepatic veins Commonly administered drugs include antacids, histamine blockers, sucralfate, proton pump inhibi- tors, the treatment of H. pylori ; vasopressin may be administered to produce vaso- constriction /H18546Nursing interventions Monitor vital signs and other hemodynamic parameters for early detection of bleeding and hypovolemic shock; monitor hourly intake and output; maintain nothing-by-mouth status until bleed-ing is controlled Initiate two large-bore I.V. lines for fl uid, drug, and blood administration Ensure patency and proper placement of the NG tube If the patient has a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube, make sure it's properly positioned and secured; the balloon shouldn't be infl ated for more than 72 hours because of the high risk of tissue damage; keep scis- sors at the bedside to cut the airway lumens for immediate tube removal should airway obstruction occur During vasopressin administration, continuously monitor electrocardiogram results and blood pressure Teach the patient how to prevent recurrence of GI bleeding by avoiding aspirin, aspirin-containing products, and NSAIDs Hepatitis /H18546Description Hepatitis is an acute or a chronic infl ammation of the liver It's caused by viruses, bacteria, trauma, immune disorders, exposure to chemicals such as vinyl chlo- ride and hydrocarbons, and toxins Five major types of viral hepatitis exist: hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E (see Characteristics of viral hepatitis ); of the 60,000 annual cases of viral hepatitis in the United States, about one-half are hepatitis B; hepatitis G is a newly identi ed virus thought to be blood-borne, with transmission similar to that of hepatitis C /H18546Signs and symptoms The prodromal or preicteric phase, which lasts 1 to 2 days, can cause arthralgia, anorexia, aversion to cigarettes (among smokers), constipation or diarrhea, decreased senses of taste and smell, dislike of dietary protein, elevated serologic test results, headache, hepatomegaly, low-grade fever, lymphade-nopathy, malaise, nausea, right upper quadrant pain or discomfort, splenomegaly, urticaria with or without rash, vomiting, and weight loss 220 Med-Surg_Chap12.indd 220 8/2/2011 2:54:28 PM 8/2/2011 2:54:28 PMHepatitis 221 Characteristic Hepatitis A Hepatitis B Hepatitis C Hepatitis D Hepatitis E Incubation period15 to 45 days 28 to 180 days 15 to 160 days 28 to 180 days 14 to 63 days Mode of transmission Fecal-oral route Parenteral (serum of infected persons);

physical examination that reveals hepatomegaly, liver ten- derness, and jaundice; serologic liver function tests (such as bilirubin and protein levels and PT); and antibody tests for surface or cellular antigens in serum (Serologic assays for hepatitis G are being developed.) Rest is prescribed, including bed rest if hepatomegaly is severe Supplements of vitamins B, C, and K are administered The recommended diet is high in calories and carbohydrates and has moderate to high protein and moderate fat If the patient has hepatitis B, C, or D, antiviral therapy may be used for the treatment of chronic disease /H18546Nursing interventions Use standard precautions to avoid spreading the disease and to protect the patient from other diseases Balance rest and activity to reduce metabolic demands on the liver Monitor the patient for changes in signs and symptoms\u2014especially dark-colored urine, fatigue, fever, jaundice, and liver function\u2014to assess the disease's status Monitor fl uid intake and output; correct fl uid and electrolyte imbalances as prescribed Administer immune serum globulin (ISG) as prescribed to modify the effects of hepatitis A and B in people who have been exposed Consult a dietitian about the prescribed diet; discuss the patient's food preferences, and intervene to increase the patient's appetite and food retention to ensure adequate calorie and protein intake Discuss the dangers of self-medication, and encourage the patient to use only prescribed medica- tions; an infl amed liver can't some drugs\u2014especially acetaminophen\u2014may exacerbate infl ammation Follow preventive measures for hepatitis A: proper hand hygiene, good personal hygiene, environ- mental sanitation, screening and control of food handlers, enteric precautions, and ISG administration for exposure prophylaxis Follow preventive measures for hepatitis B: proper hand hygiene, screening of blood donors for hepatitis B surface antigen, use of disposable needles and syringes, registration of carriers, pas-sive immunization with ISG and hepatitis B immune globulin for exposure to mucous secretions or needle-stick exposure, and active immunization with hepatitis B vaccine for high-risk populations such as health care providers Follow the same preventive measures for hepatitis C as for hepatitis B Follow standard precautions for hepatitis A: use gloves and a gown if touching soiled or infective material (feces) is likely; place the patient who has poor personal hygiene in a private room, and follow precautions for 7 days after jaundice appears Follow standard precautions for hepatitis B: use gloves and a gown if touching soiled or infective materials (blood, body fl uids, or feces if patient has GI bleeding) is likely Follow standard precautions for hepatitis C; use gloves and a gown if touching soiled or infective materials (blood or body fl uids) is likely Provide a referral to a community nurse for continuity of care as needed Large- and small-bowel obstruction /H18546Description Large-bowel obstruction can occur in the ascending, transverse, or descending colon; the rectum; or several areas small-bowel obstruction 223 Small-bowel obstruction can occur in any area of the duodenum, jejunum, or ileum or in several areas simultaneously Small- and large-bowel obstructions may result from infection, tumor, or intestinal ulcerations with scar formation that lead to obstruction, volvulus, intussusception, adhesions, or paralytic ileus Complications of small- and large-bowel obstruction include hypovolemic shock, peritonitis, rupture, septicemia, and death /H18546Signs and symptoms Abdominal pain and distention may be mild to severe Anorexia and nausea may be accompanied by severe vomiting with a fecal odor Bowel sounds may be high-pitched or absent Constipation or obstipation may be present, or diarrhea may occur as liquid intestinal secretions and feces move around the obstruction; blood, mucus, or undigested food may appear in stool Abdominal girth may increase due to distention Vital sign changes may include fever and signs of shock, such as hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea Other effects may include anxiety, dehydration, dry skin, fatigue, malaise, and weight loss /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis may require patient history, physical examination, abdominal X-rays (such as fl at plate of the abdomen, barium enema, and GI series), serologic studies, colonoscopy, and proctoscopy nothing-by-mouth status, and administer I.V. therapy to restore fl uid balance An NG or intestinal tube is inserted to relieve abdominal distention and vomiting An opioid analgesic is used to relieve pain An antibiotic is administered to treat possible infection Abdominal girth is measured every 2 to 4 hours Bowel output is monitored, and stools are checked for occult blood Surgery may be used to correct the obstruction; exploratory laparotomy can determine the cause, small- or large-bowel resection can remove diseased portions, ileostomy or colostomy may be done to permit waste discharge, and total ablation (removal) of the large and most of small intestine may be used if the obstruction is caused by mesenteric artery thrombosis /H18546Nursing interventions Monitor vital signs, particularly noting signs of shock (increased pulse and respiratory rates and decreased blood pressure) and peritonitis or other infection (increased temperature) Administer prescribed medications promptly to maintain therapeutic blood levels Maintain I.V. therapy to ensure proper hydration because the patient must maintain nothing- by- mouth status Monitor fl uid intake and output (including vomitus and diarrhea) carefully; excessive fl uid loss can lead to shock and dehydration Monitor, measure, and record drainage from the NG or intestinal tube; check drainage for blood and odor, irrigate the tube as prescribed to maintain patency, and turn the patient as prescribed to facilitate tube passage to the obstruction site Measure abdominal girth every 2 to 4 hours to assess distention Auscultate and characterize bowel sounds; high-pitched sounds indicate anoxia resulting from marked distention or obstruction, whereas absent sounds indicate ileus or obstruction Monitor eructation (a sign of continuing obstruction) or fl atus passage (a sign of resolving obstruction) Monitor the patient for abdominal pain or tenderness, noting its location; pain may be related to dis- tention or infl ammation Encourage the patient to perform deep-breathing exercises every 2 hours; abdominal distention may elevate the diaphragm and decrease deep breathing Prepare the patient for surgery, if indicated Keep the patient and family apprised of the situation Med-Surg_Chap12.indd 223 Med-Surg_Chap12.indd of the pancreas accompanied by the release of digestive enzymes into the gland, resulting in autodigestion of the organ Pancreatitis may be acute or chronic Causes of pancreatitis include alcohol abuse, trauma, infection, drug toxicity, and obstruction of the biliary tract /H18546Signs and symptoms Pancreatitis is characterized by severe epigastric pain that worsens after meals and may radiate to the shoulder, substernal area, back, and fl ank Fever and malaise may be present The patient may experience abdominal tenderness and distention, nausea, and vomiting; he may lie in a knee-chest or fetal position or lean forward for comfort Bulky, fatty, foul-smelling stool may occur Signs of hypovolemic shock may be present /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis is based on patient history, including alcohol intake and use of prescription and nonpre- scription drugs Laboratory tests include and decreased serum calcium levels Other diagnostic tools include abdominal and chest X-rays, ultrasound, CT scan, MRI, and endo- scopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography Cullen's sign (bruising of the near the umbilicus) and Grey Turner's sign (bruis- ing of the fl anks of the abdomen) are positive The patient maintains nothing-by-mouth status, and an NG tube is inserted; total parenteral nutrition may be indicated I.V. fl uids are administered, and electrolytes are replaced as indicated An analgesic and an antibiotic may be prescribed; elevated glucose levels are controlled Surgical intervention is used to treat the underlying cause, if appropriate /H18546Nursing interventions Make sure the patient maintains nothing-by-mouth status during the acute phase; then begin to introduce bland, low-fat, high-protein diet of small, frequent meals with restricted caffeine and gas-forming foods Monitor for symptoms of calcium de ciency (such as tetany, cramps, carpopedal spasm, and sei- zures) Provide mouth, nares, and skin care Check the NG tube for patency, and correct placement each shift Monitor intake and output and vital signs, and obtain daily weights Administer an analgesic (usually meperidine) as needed Advise the patient to avoid alcohol, caffeine, and spices Explain the importance of a quiet, restful environment to conserve energy and decrease metabolic demands Peptic ulcer disease /H18546Description Peptic ulcer disease is characterized by the stomach (gastric), or small intes- tine (duodenal); approximately 80% are duodenal Peptic ulcer disease is caused by erosion of the lining cells of the stomach or duodenum; factors such as H. pylori infection and NSAIDs disrupt the normal mucosal defense, making the mucosa more sus- ceptible to the effects of gastric disease 225 /H18546Signs and symptoms Gastric and duodenal ulcers have different signs and symptoms (see Common signs and symptoms of peptic ulcer disease ) Other effects may include anorexia, dizziness, eructation, and light-headedness or syncope The patient may have a family history of peptic ulcer disease; medication history of aspirin or other anti-infl ammatory drug use; or a personal history of cigarette, alcohol, or caffeine use or of stressful conditions at home or on the job /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis may be based on patient history, physical examination, gastric endoscopy, barium test, upper-GI series, gastric analysis, gastric cytology, serologic studies, testing for H. pylori, and stool gastric acid production; an antacid is also prescribed to neutralize hydrochloric acid A proton pump inhibitor, such as esomeprazole (Nexium) or lansoprazole (Prevacid), may be used to suppress acid production by halting the mechanism that pumps acid into the stomach Sucralfate, a cytoprotective drug, may be prescribed; it works by forming a protective barrier over the ulcer's surface Misoprostol (Cytotec), a synthetic prostaglandin analogue, may be prescribed to prevent ulcers from forming in patients who take high doses of an NSAID by protecting the gastric mucous; an antibiotic may be prescribed to treat H. pylori infections; bismuth is also used as adjunct therapy against H. pylori Symptom Gastric ulcer Duodenal ulcer Pain Type Gnawing, burning, aching, heartburn Gnawing, burning, cramping, heartburn at times Duration Constant unless relieved by food or drugs Intermittent and relieved by food or drugs (steady pain may be related to a perforated ulcer of the posterior wall of the duodenum) Site Upper epigastrium with localization to left of umbilicusRight epigastric area to right of umbilicus; radiation of pain to right upper quadrant may be due to a perfo-rated ulcer of the posterior wall of the duodenum Time of day At night and when stomach is empty At night and when duodenum is empty Cause Presence of hydrochloric acid in stomach High acid content of chyme moving into duodenum Periodicity Recurs daily for a period of time, then dis-appears for months, only to recurRecurs daily for a period of time, then disappears for months, only to recur Nausea Intermittent Intermittent Vomiting Occasional (more often than with duode-nal ulcers)Occasional Feeling of fullness Present at times; eructation common Present at times Bleeding Detected in vomitus, unless hemorrhage occursDetected in stools through stool guaiac and disorders Stress-reduction techniques are recommended to prevent development of a stress ulcer or worsening of peptic ulcers Smoking cessation is recommended If drug therapy is ineffective, surgical repair may include laser cauterization of a bleeding site, partial gastrectomy with gastroduodenostomy (Billroth I), partial gastrectomy or vagotomy with pyloroplasty (rare) /H18546Nursing interventions Administer prescribed medications Help the patient identify and eliminate foods that cause distress Teach the patient about the disease, its treatment, and stress-reduction techniques, if needed Encourage the patient to stop smoking to eliminate the effects of nicotine on ulcers Provide postoperative care as needed Verify placement and maintain patency of the NG tube Make sure the patient maintains nothing-by-mouth status as prescribed; administer I.V. fl uids to maintain fl uid and electrolyte balance To help control pain, encourage the patient to use patient-controlled analgesia, or administer an opioid analgesic every 3 to 4 hours Measure abdominal girth to assess abdominal distention or ileus Auscultate bowel sounds to detect the return of peristalsis Help the patient perform deep-breathing exercises every 2 hours and use an incentive spirometer every 2 hours to prevent pulmonary complications Help the patient ambulate as prescribed Take steps to avoid dumping syndrome (a rapid gastric emptying produced by a bolus of food, causing distention of the dodenum or jejunum) Start giving the patient clear liquids when prescribed; observe him for nausea or vomiting, assess his tolerance of intake, and increase to small, frequent meals Monitor for fl atus or bowel movements to determine bowel functions Before discharge, teach the patient about rest, activity restrictions, diet, medications, smoking ces- sation, and stress control Regional enteritis and ulcerative colitis /H18546Description Regional enteritis, also known as Crohn's disease, is an infl ammatory disease of the small bowel that also may affect the large intestine; it typically begins in the ileum but can affect all areas of the small intestine and even the esophagus Ulcerative colitis is a chronic infl ammatory disease of the large intestine, commonly in the sigmoid and rectal areas /H18546Signs and symptoms Regional enteritis and ulcerative colitis produce different signs and symptoms (see Comparing regional enteritis and ulcerative colitis ) The stool of a patient with ulcerative colitis may appear liquid, with blood, pus, and mucus; the patient with regional enteritis typically has diarrhea without visible blood /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Regional enteritis and ulcerative colitis are diagnosed and managed similarly; regional enteritis is diagnosed by small bowel X-ray, barium study of the upper GI tract, barium enema, and intestinal biopsy; ulcerative colitis is diagnosed by biopsy with colonoscopy, barium enema, and abdominal X-ray Tailored to the patient's speci c needs, the diet typically restricts raw fruits and vegetables as well as fatty and spicy foods; debilitated patients may require total parenteral nutrition An anticholinergic is used to manage intestinal spasms; an antidiarrheal to control diarrhea; an anti-infl and ulcerative colitis 227 The following chart compares some key characteristics of regional enteritis (Crohn's disease) and ulcerative colitis. Characteristic Regional enteritis Ulcerative colitis Areas affected All layers of the bowel in various areas of the bowel at the same timeOnly the mucosal don't skip seg- ments; ulcerations with erosion and bleeding Incidence Slightly more common in women than men, pri- marily between ages 20 and 50; more common in Jews and non-WhitesMore common in women than men, primarily those between ages 20 and 40; more common in Jews and non-Whites Cause Unknown, but may be genetic or immunologic; may be exacerbated by stressUnknown, but may be genetic, immunologic, or infectious Signs and symptoms Abdominal distention Anemia Arthralgia Cramping abdominal pain and tenderness Dehydration and fl uid and electrolyte imbalances Flatulence Low-grade fever Nausea and vomiting Three to four semisoft stools daily with no blood, except in patients with advanced disease; some fat is present, and stools may be foul-smelling Weight loss Abdominal distention Abdominal rigidity at times Anemia Bowel distention Cramping abdominal pain, typically in lower left quadrant Dehydration and fl uid and electrolyte imbalances Diarrhea (pronounced, 5 to 25 stools daily) with blood, mucus, and pus but no fat Fever Nausea and vomiting Rectal bleeding Weight loss Diagnostic tests Barium enema Proctosigmoidoscopy Stool analysis for occult blood and culture X-ray of small bowel Barium infl ammation; and an immunosuppressant to decrease antigen-antibody reactions Surgery is indicated for stula formation, intestinal obstruction, bowel perforation, hemorrhage, and intractable disease (if ulcerative colitis persists for more than 10 years, cancer may develop) Intestinal resections may need to be performed repeatedly Ileostomy is curative; ileorectal anastomosis may be performed /H18546Nursing interventions Make sure the patient understands the purpose, therapeutic effects, and adverse effects of prescribed medications Provide postoperative care for a patient undergoing surgery Maintain patency of the NG tube, if present, by irrigating with normal saline solution every 2 hours as needed Encourage the patient to use patient-controlled analgesia, or administer an opioid analgesic to relieve pain; administer a steroid to prevent adrenal insuf ciency and an antibiotic to prevent infection Monitor vital signs every 1 to 2 hours for 4 to 8 hours and then every 4 hours Med-Surg_Chap12.indd 227 Med-Surg_Chap12.indd 227 8/2/2011 2:54:28 disorders Type of stoolAppliance and bowel regulation Nursing considerations Single-barrel, or end, colostomyFormed Requires appliance until dis- charge becomes regulated; regulates bowelBowel is regulated through diet and irrigation (every 2 to 3 days). Double-barrel and loop colostomySemiliquid, semiformed, proteolytic proximal loop of the colostomy. Mucus may be discharged from a distal stoma. Loop colostomy has a plastic rod under the bowel to hold it to the outer abdomi-nal wall; rubber tubing attached to the ends of the rod prevent it from being dislodged. Conventional ileostomySemiliquid to liquid, fre- doesn't regulate bowelIleostomy discharge may contain undigested food. Patient may become dehydrated from frequent discharges of semiliquid stool. Continent ileostomy (Kock pouch)Semiliquid to liquid, constant, require appliance or regulate bowel (ileostomy has one-way valve or nipple to prevent leakage)Stoma is catheterized every 4 hours to empty Kock pouch.Comparing colostomy and ileostomy Make sure the status as prescribed; monitor I.V. fl uids every 1 to 2 hours; up to 3,000 mL of fl uid daily is needed Check wound sites for drainage and signs of infl ammation, infection, and healing; use aseptic technique to prevent infection Monitor bowel sounds every 2 to 4 hours to detect the return of peristalsis or, possibly, ileus Monitor bowel output to determine return of bowel function Help the patient ambulate as prescribed Encourage the patient to perform deep-breathing exercises and use an incentive spirometer every 2 hours to prevent pulmonary complications Start giving the patient clear liquids when prescribed; the diet initially may be a low-residue one, gradually increasing to a regular diet as tolerated Provide care for a patient with an ileostomy or a colostomy (see Comparing colostomy and ileostomy ) Change bags if they start leaking to prevent skin excoriation; the patient may change bags on a regular schedule to prevent leaking Make sure the opening of the bag around the stoma is no larger than 1/8\" (3 mm) to prevent skin excoriation Refer the patient to an enterostomal nurse therapist for care of the stoma and colostomy and psy- chosocial adjustment Provide opportunities for the patient to discuss feelings about the disease and its treatment Teach the patient how to care for the incision or the colostomy or ileostomy Refer the patient for continued nursing monitoring or assistance after discharge for continuity of care and support with new self-care procedures Med-Surg_Chap12.indd 228 Med-Surg_Chap12.indd 228 8/2/2011 2:54:28 PM 8/2/2011 2:54:28 PMReview 229 Review questions 1. A patient with peptic ulcer disease secondary to chronic NSAID use is prescribed misoprostol (Cytotec). The nurse would be most accurate in informing the patient that the drug: /H18540A. reduces the stomach's volume of hydrochloric acid. /H18540B. increases the speed of gastric emptying. /H18540C. protects the stomach's lining. /H18540D. increases LES pressure. Correct answer: C Misoprostol is a synthetic prostaglandin that, like prostaglandin, protects the gastric mucosa. NSAIDs decrease prostaglandin production and predispose the patient to peptic ulceration. Misoprostol doesn't reduce gastric acidity (Option A), improve emptying of the stomach (Option B), or increase LES pressure (Option D). 2. The nurse is caring for a patient with active upper-GI bleeding. What is the appropriate diet for this patient during the rst 24 hours after admission? /H18540A. Regular diet /H18540B. Skim milk /H18540C. Nothing by mouth /H18540D. Clear liquids Correct answer: C Shock and bleeding must be controlled before oral intake begins, so the patient should receive nothing by mouth. A regular diet (Option A) is incorrect. When the bleeding is controlled, intake is gradually increased, starting with ice chips and then clear liquids. Skim milk (Option B) is incorrect because it increases gastric acid production that could prolong the bleeding. A clear liquid diet (Option D) is the rst diet offered after bleeding and shock are controlled. 3. A patient is scheduled to have a descending colostomy. He is anxious and has many questions concerning the surgery, the care of a stoma, and lifestyle changes. It would be most appropriate for the nurse to refer the patient to which member of the health care team? /H18540A. Social worker /H18540B. Registered dietitian /H18540C. Occupational Enterostomal nurse therapist Correct answer: D An enterostomal nurse therapist is a registered nurse who has received advanced education in an accredited program to care for patients with stomas. The enterostomal nurse therapist can assist with the selection of an appropriate stoma site, teach about stoma care, and provide emotional support. Social workers (Option A) provide counseling and emotional support, but they can't provide preoperative and postoperative teaching. A registered dietitian (Option B) can review any dietary changes and help the patient with meal planning. The occupational therapist (Option C) can assist a patient with regaining independence with activities of daily living.

Sexual activity with an infected partner /H18540D. Sharing a contaminated needle or syringe Correct answer: A Hepatitis A is predominantly transmitted by the ingestion of fecally contaminated food. Transmission is more likely to occur with poor hygiene, crowded conditions, and poor sanitation. Hepatitis B and C may be transmitted through exposure to contaminated blood and blood products (Option B). Sexual activity with an infected partner (Option C) and sharing contaminated needles or syringes (Option D) may transmit hepatitis B. 5. A patient experiences an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Test results reveal elevated serum osmolality and urine speci c gravity. What is the most likely explanation for these test results? Correct answer: D Ulcerative colitis causes watery diarrhea. The patient loses large volumes of fl uid causing hemoconcentration and an elevated serum osmolality and urine speci c gravity. Renal insuf- ciency (Option A), hypoaldosteronism (Option B), and diabetes insipidus (Option C) aren't associated with ulcerative colitis. 6. A patient has just had a surgical revision of his intestinal tract. What type of procedure would the patient have undergone if his stools are formed? /H18540A. Continent end, colostomy Correct answer: D A patient who has formed stools would have undergone a single-barrel, or end, colostomy. Continent ileostomy (Option A) and conventional ileostomy (Option B) produce semiliquid to liquid stools. Double-barrel and loop colostomy (Option C) produce semiliquid to semi-formed stools. 7. Which nursing intervention should take priority when caring for a patient with appendicitis? /H18540A. Assessing for pain /H18540B. Encouraging oral intake of clear fl uids /H18540C. Providing discharge teaching /H18540D. Assessing for signs and symptoms of peritonitis Correct answer: D Assessing for peritonitis, or infl ammation of the peritoneal cavity, takes highest pri- ority when caring for a patient with appendicitis. Peritonitis typically results from a ruptured appendix and invasion of bacteria, which can be lethal. The patient with appendicitis will have pain that should be controlled with analgesia (Option A), but that doesn't take priority. The nurse should discourage-not encourage-oral intake (Option B) in preparation for surgery. Although discharge teaching is important (Option C), in the acute phase, management should focus on minimizing preoperative complications and recognizing such complications when they occur.

When teaching a patient about GERD, the nurse describes the disorder as: /H18540A. erosion of the stomach acid into the esophagus. Correct answer: D GERD is described as refl ux of stomach acid into the esophagus. Although a patient with GERD can experience erosion of the gastric mucosa (Option A), this happens as a result of GERD and isn't a description of the disorder. Infl ammation of a diverticulum (Option B) is called diverticulitis. Gastritis is an infl ammation of the gastric mucosa (Option C). 9. Which type of diet is implicated in the development of diverticulosis? /H18540A. A low- ber diet /H18540B. A high- ber diet /H18540C. A high-protein diet /H18540D. A low-carbohydrate diet Correct answer: A Low- ber diets have been implicated in the development of diverticula because these diets decrease the bulk in the stool and predispose the person to the development of constipa-tion. A high- ber diet (Option B) is recommended to help prevent diverticulosis. A high-protein diet (Option C) or low-carbohydrate diet (Option D) has no effect on the development of diverticulosis. 10. Crohn's disease can be described as a chronic relapsing disease. Which area of the GI system may be involved with this disease? /H18540A. The entire length of the large colon /H18540B. Only the sigmoid area /H18540C. The entire large colon through the layers of mucosa and submucosa /H18540D. The small intestine and colon, affecting the entire thickness of the bowel Correct answer: D Crohn's disease more commonly involves any segment of the small intestine, the colon, or both, affecting the entire thickness of the bowel. However, it can also affect the digestive system anywhere from the mouth to the anus. Options A and C describe ulcerative colitis. Option B is too spe-ci c and, therefore, not likely.Review questions 231 2:54:28 PM232 Introduction /H18546The skin is the largest organ in the body /H18546It provides a barrier against pathogens, radiation, and trauma; regulates body temperature; and is the site of vitamin D production /H18546Pressure receptors in the skin provide the sense of touch /H18546Nursing history The nurse asks the patient about his chief complaint The most common complaints concerning the integumentary system are itching, lesions, pigmen- tation abnormalities, and rashes The patient may also have problems with changes in nail growth or color, hair loss, or increased growth or distribution of hair The nurse then questions the patient about his present illness Ask the patient about his symptom, including when it started, associated symptoms, location, radiation, intensity, duration, frequency, and precipitating and alleviating factors Ask how and when skin changes occurred; ask if he has experienced any bleeding, drainage, or itching Question the patient about any recent insect bites Ask about the use of prescription and over-the-counter drugs (especially ointments, creams, or lotions), herbal remedies, and vitamin and nutritional supplements The nurse asks about medical history Question the patient about a history of skin, nail, or hair problems Ask about previous diseases or conditions The nurse then assesses the family history Ask about a family history of chronic skin infections, cancer, or other diseases Question the patient about a family history of disorders of the hair or nails Ask about a family history of other chronic diseases The nurse obtains a social history Ask about support systems, work, exercise, diet, use of recreational drugs, alcohol use, stress, hobbies, and coping mechanisms Ask how much time the patient spends in the sun and whether protective clothing and sunscreen are worn /H18546Physical assessment Nurse begins with inspection Examine the patient's mucous membranes, hair, scalp, axillae, groin, palms, soles, and nails; note changes in pigmentation; note the color, size, shape, con guration, pattern of distribution, depth or height, texture, and location of any lesions (see Differentiating among skin lesions ) Note the patient's level of hygiene, including any odors Next, the nurse uses palpation Palpate the skin and note texture, consistency, temperature, moisture, edema, and turgor Note any areas of tenderness or lesions13Skin carcinoma /H18546Description Basal cell carcinoma is an epidermal tumor predominantly found on exposed surfaces of the skin; tumors remain localized, and metastasis is rare Basal cell carcinoma is a slow-growing, destructive skin tumor that usually occurs in people older than age 40; it's most prevalent in blond, fair-skinned men and is the most common malignant tumor that affects whites; chronic sun exposure is the most common causePrimary lesions Bulla Fluid- lled lesion more than 2 cm in diameter (also called a blister); occurs in patients with severe poison oak or ivy dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, or example, acne Macule Flat, pigmented, circumscribed area less than 1 cm in diameter\u2014for example, freckle or rash that occurs in patients with rubella Nodule Firm, raised lesion, 0.6 to 2 cm in diam-eter, that is deeper than a papule and extends infl ammatory, raised lesion up to 0.6 cm in diameter that may be the same color as skin or pigmented\u2014for example, acne papule and lichen planusPatch Flat, pigmented, circumscribed area more than 1 cm in diameter\u2014for example, herald patch (pityriasis rosea) Plaque Circumscribed, solid, elevated lesion more than 1 cm in diameter that is elevated above skin surface and that occupies larger surface area in comparison with height, as occurs in psoriasis Pustule Raised, circumscribed lesion, usually less than 1 cm in diameter, that contains pu-rulent material, making it a yellow-white color\u2014for example, acne or impetiginous pustule and furuncle Tumor Elevated, solid lesion larger than 2 cm in diameter that extends into dermal and in as occurs in chickenpox or herpes simplex infection Wheal Raised, rm lesion with intense localized skin edema that varies in size, shape, and color (from pale pink to red) and that disappears in hours\u2014for example, hives and insect bitesDifferentiating among skin lesions These illustrations depict the most common primary skin lesions. carcinoma: nodular, super cial, morpheaform, and pigmented carcinoma, an invasive tumor arising from keratinizing epidermal cells, has the poten- tial for metastasis Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin usually appears on sun-damaged skin but may arise from nor- mal skin or preexisting lesions Prognosis is good for basal cell carcinoma because tumors remain localized Immunosuppressed patients have a higher incidence of both basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma /H18546Signs and symptoms Basal cell carcinoma A pearly papule, typically with telangiectasis, raised borders, and super cial ulceration, is characteristic of the nodular form Super cial basal cell carcinoma appears as a well-demarcated erythematous scaly patch without ulceration, commonly on the trunk A pale, yellow, or white fl at or depressed scarlike plaque with indistinct borders suggests mor- pheaform basal cell Pigmented basal cell carcinoma appears as a pearly papule that contains melanin and looks blue, black, or brown in color Squamous cell carcinoma Squamous cell carcinoma appears as a red, crusted, scaly patch on the skin; a nonhealing ulcer; or a rm, red-black nodule It also as sandpaper-like lesion /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Basal and squamous their appearance; incisional or excisional biopsy and histologic study may help to determine the tumor type and histologic subtype Treatment options include surgical excision, electrodesiccation and curettage, cryosurgery, radiation therapy, and Mohs' surgery Interferon therapy and fl uorouracil or imiquimod may also be used /H18546Nursing interventions Monitor the skin after biopsy for bleeding Assess the patient's skin while you're helping him bathe or perform range-of-motion (ROM) exercises Explain to the patient which treatments he's receiving Encourage the patient to express feelings about changes in body image and a fear of dying; offer emotional support and encouragement Provide postchemotherapy and postradiation nursing care to promote healing Teach the patient and family members about wound care, protection from the sun, lifestyle modi ca- tions, skin examination, and the importance of follow-up examinations Burns /H18546Description A burn is a lesion caused by re, friction or abrasion, heat, caustic substances, electricity, or radiation Burn injury is the result of heat that causes tissue destruction from coagulation, protein denaturation, or ionization of cellular contents Burns are classified by their depth and the amount of tissue damage (see Burn classification ) Burns are also classi ed by the extent of the body surface area injured Burns of less than 20% of total body surface area (TBSA) produce a primarily local response; burns of greater than 20% of TBSA produce both a local and a systemic response Systemic responses include fl uid and electrolyte shifts, hypovolemia, shock, and respiratory distress; complications include renal failure, immunologic compromise, and GI bleeding 234 blisters Weeping, edematous blisters Dry, leathery, and possibly edematous Color Pink White to pink or red White to charred Comfort Painful Very painful Little or no pain Depth Epidermis only Epidermis, dermis, and possi- bly some muscle, and boneBurn classi cation /H18546Treatment in stage 1 (immediate or emergent stage) Stage 1 begins when the patient is burned and continues until the patient's condition is stabilized and fl uids have been replaced The burn team implements lifesaving measures A patent airway is established Oxygen is supplied by nasal cannula or endotracheal tube A patent large-bore I.V. line is established for fl uid resuscitation, which is titrated to urine output (not burn size) The extent and depth of burn area are determined The patient is assessed for other injuries, including smoke inhalation The severity of the burn is determined The amount of body surface involved is determined by the Rule of Nines: head and neck (9%), arms (9% each), anterior trunk posterior (18% each), and perineum (1%) The speci c body parts involved, such as the face and neck, are identi ed The burn depth (partial- or full-thickness) is noted The causative agent is identi ed as thermal, chemical, or electrical The patient's age is documented because it alters body surface area estimates based on body pro- portions; the Lund-Browder classi cation is used to estimate body surface area burned in a pediatric patient Fluid and electrolyte balance is the chief concern for up to 48 hours after a major burn; the greatest fl uid loss occurs in the rst 12 hours; the larger the burned area, the greater the fl uid loss Burns initially cause capillaries in the damaged area to dilate Increased hyperpermeability causes fl uid to move out of cells into surrounding tissues; this fl uid movement causes edema and vesiculation (blistering) Proteins, plasma, and electrolytes shift to the interstitial compartment; red blood cells remain in the vascular system, causing increased blood viscosity and false hematocrit elevation Burns also cause acute dehydration and poor renal perfusion Burn shock is a serious complication caused by decreased fl uid volume Most burn-related deaths result from burn shock Signs and symptoms of burn shock include decreased urine output, tachycardia, hypotension, tachypnea with shallow respirations, and restlessness /H18546Treatment in stage 2 (intermediate or acute stage) Stage 2 begins 48 to 72 hours after the burn injury Circulatory overload is the chief concern as fl uid shifts back into the cells from the interstitial areas, and the kidneys begin to excrete large volumes of urine (diuresis) Vital signs, urine output, and level of consciousness must be monitored during this stage Med-Surg_Chap13.indd 235 Med-Surg_Chap13.indd 235 8/2/2011 2:55:21 PM 8/2/2011 inhalation damages the respiratory and mucosa, decreases the amount of alveolar surfac- tant, and can cause atelectasis Breathing dif culties\u2014especially in patients with burns in the upper chest, neck, and face \u2014 may occur immediately or may not occur for several hours Symptoms of smoke inhalation include hoarseness, in stage 3 (rehabilitation stage) Stage 3 begins after the burn area is treated; prevention of infection is the chief concern, and the goal is to return the patient to a productive life The patient may need to wear elastic garments to decrease scarring and may need cosmetic surgery and psychological and vocational counseling /H18546Burn care Burned areas may be left exposed (open to air) if the burn doesn't encircle the arm, trunk, or leg An occlusive dressing may be applied (covered with a nonadhesive, water-permeable mesh gauze) The burn may require primary excision, or debridement (removal of necrotic or damaged tissue) Skin grafting may be necessary Autograft is obtained from undamaged parts of the patient's body Homograft is obtained from a person other than the patient Xenograft is obtained from a different species such as a pig Isograft is obtained from an identical twin /H18546Nursing interventions Maintain a patent airway Monitor vital signs every 15 minutes to evaluate the effectiveness of fl uid resuscitation and to detect secondary infections Encourage coughing and deep breathing to promote lung expansion and adequate gas exchange Establish an I.V. line to initiate fl uid replacement with a colloid and crystalloid solution (lactated Ringer's solution) during the rst 24 hours Insert an indwelling urinary catheter to measure urine output and identify potential renal shutdown If possible, weigh the patient on admission to obtain baseline data Provide hyperalimentation (concentrated glucose and amino acids) if needed; insert a nasogastric tube as ordered to decompress the stomach and prevent aspiration of stomach contents If the patient hasn't had a booster shot within the past 5 years, administer tetanus toxoid; the patient may have an injury prone to tetanus Administer an I.V. analgesic, such as morphine, to reduce discomfort Administer an antibiotic as prescribed; the patient is more susceptible to infection because the skin's protective function is compromised Long-term treatment with an antacid and a histamine-2 receptor antagonist may be needed to main- tain pH and reduce the risk of Curling's ulcer Keep the patient warm; he may lose body heat through the burn area and may become hypothermic Use aseptic technique when assisting the patient in the whirlpool bath (for debridement) and when changing the dressing Apply the prescribed topical agent to prevent bacterial infections; be aware that silver nitrate pro- duces stains, mafenide acetate (Sulfamylon) can cause temporary stinging and burning (analgesia may be needed before application), and silver sulfadiazine (Silvadene) maintains adequate hydration in a patient receiving sulfonamides Perform ROM exercises for affected areas, if possible, to maintain function Encourage the patient and family to discuss feelings and concerns Lyme disease /H18546Description Lyme disease is an infl ammatory, multisystemic disorder caused by a spirochete, which is transmit- ted by a deer tick bite; the disease is most common in the causes many complications, arthritis, cranial pericarditis /H18546Signs and symptoms Lyme disease may cause a distinctive, expanding skin lesion that is called erythema chronicum migrans (bull's-eye rash), is warm to the touch, and has an intense red border The lesion appears 3 days to 4 weeks after the tick bite Common lesion sites are the groin, buttocks, axillae, trunk, upper arms, and legs Lyme disease occurs in three stages Stage 1 begins with a tick bite and erythema chronicum migrans , followed by chills, fatigue, fever, sore throat, and stiff neck\u2014that is, signs and symptoms that may be mistaken for meningitis; the classic bull's-eye skin lesion begins as a small papule at the site of the bite and gradually enlarges into a round or oval ring with central clearing Stage II is characterized by neurologic effects, such as Bell's palsy, and cardiac effects, such as arrhythmias or heart block; this is also called the disseminated phase Stage III, the chronic phase, is characterized by arthritis, usually of the knees; the patient may have recurrent attacks up to 3 years after the rash appears /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Blood tests, including antibody titers to identify Borrelia burgdorferi, are the most practical diagnostic tests; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay has greater sensitivity and speci city Serologic tests don't always con rm the diagnosis\u2014especially in the early stages before the body produces antibodies\u2014or seropositivity for B. burgdorferi Mild anemia along aminotransferase levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum immunoglobulin M levels, and white blood cell count support the diagnosis A lumbar puncture may be ordered if Lyme disease involves the central nervous system As soon as the diagnosis is made, the patient is treated with oral doxycycline, amoxicillin, or erythro- mycin for 10 to 21 days Patients in stages II and III are treated with I.V. or I.M. penicillin or ceftriaxone A salicylate or another nonsteroidal anti-infl ammatory drug (NSAID) may be prescribed to reduce infl ammation /H18546Nursing interventions Plan care to provide adequate rest Monitor vital signs to evaluate the patient's response to treatment Use a cardiac monitor or electrocardiogram to determine cardiac involvement Check for neurologic signs to assess neurologic involvement Promote the patient's comfort with position changes and skin care Educate the patient about the disease, including measures to prevent and avoid exposure to ticks; also explain that if he nds a tick on his body, he should grasp it with tweezers and pull it straight out Encourage the patient to discuss feelings about the disease Report infections to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Malignant melanoma /H18546Description Malignant melanoma is a neoplasm derived from dermal or epidermal cells; it's the leading cause of death from skin cancer Prognosis is related to the thickness of the tumor at the time of diagnosis Exposure to sunlight and tanning bed use increase the risk of malignant melanoma; fair-skinned, blond- or red-haired people are at greater relative risk than persons with darker pigmentation; genetic predisposition may contribute to the development of melanoma Melanoma originates in normal skin or an existing mole and metastasizes to other areas of the body; common sites are the back, legs, between the toes, scalp, back of the hands, face, and neck The 5-year survival rate is poor when the lesion is more than 1.5 mm thick or regional lymph nodes are involved Med-Surg_Chap13.indd 237 Med-Surg_Chap13.indd 237 8/2/2011 2:55:21 PM 8/2/2011 disorders /H18546Signs and symptoms Signs of melanoma include a change in borders, color, size, or shape of a preexisting skin lesion or an irregular, circular bordered lesion with hues of tan, black, or blue A nodular melanoma is spherical and may resemble a blood blister; its color is blue-black The lesion may produce local soreness and may be accompanied by pruritus, oozing, bleeding, or crusting /H18546Diagnosis and treatment An excisional skin biopsy shows cytology positive for malignant melanoma Diagnostic studies may include chest X-ray, a gallium scan, bone scan, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography scans of the head, chest, and abdomen to evaluate possible metastases Treatment depends on lesion thickness; initial treatment includes a wide excision of the lesion and involved lymph nodes in the vicinity of the tumor; skin grafting may follow There are no dependable, curative, systemic treatments for malignant melanoma; most treatments are aimed at slowing progression and relieving symptoms A chemotherapeutic agent may be directly infused into the lesion, or a combination of direct infusion and systemic chemotherapeutic treatment may be used Administration of interferon and interleukin-2 may achieve temporary remission Radiation therapy may be used for palliative effects /H18546Nursing interventions Perform assessments while bathing the patient or performing ROM exercises; this approach is less obvious, and the patient may be more relaxed Medicate for discomfort, especially if a wide excision is necessary Teach the patient about the disease, including prevention measures, such as decreasing exposure to ultraviolet rays, using sunscreen, avoiding tanning booths, and performing a monthly self-examination, during which time he should check all skin lesions for changes Answer the patient's questions to decrease anxiety Identify resources and support systems to help the patient cope Encourage the patient to express feelings about the disease Psoriasis /H18546Description Psoriasis is a chronic, noninfectious infl ammatory skin occurs in up to 2% of the popula- tion It's thought to be an autoimmune response and seems to have a genetic basis The disease is most often diagnosed in people ages 15 to 35; it has a tendency to improve and recur periodically; recurrence is often triggered by stress, infections, and seasonal and hormonal changes Psoriatic arthritis may develop as a complication /H18546Signs and symptoms Psoriasis is characterized by reddish papules and plaques covered with silvery scales; scaly patches form from the buildup of living and dead skin Skin patches are dry and may be pruritic; the patient's nails may be pitted, discolored, and crumbling Lesions appear bilaterally and may range from mild to severe; the scalp, face, elbows, knees, lower back, and genitalia are most often affected /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis is based on the appearance of the lesions Treatment is palliative and aims to slow rapid turnover of the epidermis, promote resolution of the lesions, and control the disease cycle Topical treatments include coal tar products, steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-infl ammatory oral gold, etretinate, and methotrexate; biologic agents that used include infl iximab (Remicade) and etanercept (Enbrel) Ultraviolet A or B light treatments may also help Med-Surg_Chap13.indd 238 Med-Surg_Chap13.indd 238 8/2/2011 2:55:21 PM 8/2/2011 2:55:21 PMReview 239 /H18546Nursing interventions Teach the patient about the disease; help identify disease triggers and work with the patient to mod- ify those triggers Discuss treatment options and the need for consistency and compliance to achieve results; acknowl- edge that treatments are often time-consuming Teach the patient about the possible need for frequent and prolonged bathing to soften and remove scales, followed by application of prescribed creams or ointments Discuss establishing a skin care program, even when the disease isn't in the acute phase Provide emotional support to the patient experiencing body image concerns or depression related to this chronic disease Provide comfort measures and treatment to relieve itching and pain Review questions 1. The nurse is teaching a patient diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma. The most common cause of basal cell carcinoma is: /H18540A. immunosuppression. /H18540B. radiation exposure. /H18540C. sun exposure. /H18540D. burns. Correct answer: C Sun exposure is the best known and most common cause of basal cell carcinoma. Immunosuppression (Option A), radiation (Option B), and burns (Option D) are less common causes. 2. A patient received burns to his entire back and left arm. Using the Rule of Nines, the nurse can calculate that he has sustained burns on what percentage of the Rule of Nines, each of the posterior and anterior trunks and legs makes up 18% of the total body surface, each of the arms makes up 9%, the head and neck make up 9%, and the perineum makes up 1%. In this case, the patient received burns to his back (18%) and one arm (9%), totaling 27% of his body. 3. A patient is admitted to a burn intensive care unit with extensive full-thickness burns. The nurse is most concerned about the patient's: /H18540A. fl uid and electrolyte status. /H18540B. risk of infection. /H18540C. body image. /H18540D. level of pain. Correct answer: A During the early phase of burn care, the nurse is most concerned with fl uid resus- citation and electrolyte balance, to correct large-volume fl uid loss through the damaged skin. Infection (Option B), body image (Option C), and pain (Option D) are signi cant areas of concern, but are less urgent than fl uid status. Med-Surg_Chap13.indd 239 Med-Surg_Chap13.indd 239 8/2/2011 2:55:21 PM 8/2/2011 2:55:21 PM240 Skin disorders 4. A patient undergoes a biopsy to con rm a diagnosis of skin cancer. Immediately following the procedure, the nurse should observe the site for: /H18540A. infection. /H18540B. The nurse's main concern following a skin biopsy procedure is bleeding. Infection (Option A) is a later possible consequence of a biopsy. Dehiscence (Option B) is more likely in larger wounds such as surgical wounds of the abdomen or thorax. Swelling (Option D) is a normal reaction associated with any event that traumatizes the skin. 5. The nurse is caring for a patient with malignant melanoma. The nurse explains that the rst and most important treatment for malignant melanoma is: /H18540A. chemotherapy. /H18540B. immunotherapy. /H18540C. radiation therapy. /H18540D. wide excision. Correct answer: D Wide excision is the primary treatment for malignant melanoma and removes the entire lesion and determines the level and staging. Chemotherapy (Option A) may be used after the mel-anoma is excised. Immunotherapy (Option B) is experimental. Radiation therapy (Option C) is palliative. 6. A 19-year-old patient comes to the clinic with dark red lesions on her hands, wrist, and waistline. She has scratched several of the lesions so that they are open and bleeding. The nurse instructs the patient to try pressing on the itchy lesions. What is the rationale for this intervention? /H18540A. Pressing the skin spreads the bene cial microorganisms. /H18540B. Pressing is suggested before scratching. /H18540C. Pressing the skin promotes breaks in the skin. /H18540D. Pressing the skin stimulates nerve endings. Correct answer: D Pressing the skin stimulates nerve endings and can reduce the sensation of itching. Pressing the skin (Option A) doesn't spread microorganisms; instead, scratching the skin opens portals of entry for harmful bacteria. Scratching (Option B) isn't recommended at all. Pressing the skin doesn't pro-mote breaks in the skin (Option C). 7. A patient arrives at the of ce of his physician complaining of a rash. The nurse assesses the patient and notes several palpable, elevated masses, each about 0.5 cm in diameter. What term would the nurse use to accu-rately are rm, palpable raised lesions of up to 0.6 cm in diameter. Erosions (Option A) are characterized as a loss of some or all of the epidermal layer. Macules (Option B) are non-palpable, fl at changes in skin color. Vesicles (Option D) uid- 2:55:21 PMReview questions 241 8. A patient has thick, discolored nails with splintered hemorrhages, easily separated from the nail bed. There are also \"ice pick\" pits and ridges. The nurse explains to the patient that these ndings are a chronic skin disorder with an unknown cause, can result in these char- acteristic changes in the nails. A paronychia (Option A) is a bacterial infection of the nail bed. Seborrhea (Option C), also called cradle cap, is a chronic infl ammatory dermatitis that typically affects the scalp. Scabies (Option D) are mites that burrow under the skin, generally between the webbing of the ngers and toes. 9. After the initial phase of a burn injury, the primary focus of a patient's cure is: /H18540A. enhancing self-esteem. /H18540B. promoting hygiene. /H18540C. reducing anxiety. /H18540D. preventing infection. Correct answer: D Because the body's protective barrier is damaged and the immune system is com- promised, preventing infection is the primary goal. Enhancing self-esteem (Option A), promoting hygiene (Option B), and reducing anxiety (Option C) are important, but they're not the primary focus of treatment. 10. Which patient is at greatest risk for impaired wound healing after surgery? /H18540A. A 65-year-old patient with hypertension /H18540B. A 60-year-old patient who is slightly overweight /H18540C. A 78-year-old patient in general good health /H18540D. A 75-year-old patient with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus Correct answer: D Poorly controlled diabetes is a serious risk factor for impaired wound healing. Other factors that delay wound healing include advanced age, inadequate blood supply, nutritional de cien- cies, and obesity. Hypertension (Option A), being slightly overweight (Option B), and being older but in generally good health (Option C) aren't as serious risk factors in wound healing. Med-Surg_Chap13.indd 241 system plays a signi cant role in human growth, metabolism, and environmental adaptation /H18546Along with the nervous system, the endocrine system provides a communication system for the body /H18546By releasing hormones from various ductless glands, the endocrine system carefully regulates many physiologic functions /H18546Nursing history The nurse asks the patient about his chief complaint A patient with an endocrine disorder may report abnormalities of fatigue, mental status changes, polydipsia, polyuria, weakness, and weight change The patient with an endocrine disorder may also report problems of sexual maturity and function The nurse then questions the patient about his present illness Ask the patient about his symptom, including when it started, associated symptoms, location, radiation, intensity, duration, frequency, and precipitating and alleviating factors Ask about the use of prescription and over-the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, and vitamin and nutritional supplements The nurse asks about medical history Question the patient about other endocrine disorders, such as diabetes mellitus, Addison's disease, and Cushing's disease; height and weight problems; sexual problems; and thyroid disease Ask the female patient about past reproductive problems and use of oral contraceptives and hormones; also ask whether she's premenopausal or postmenopausal The nurse then assesses the family history Ask about a family history of endocrine disorders, such as diabetes mellitus and thyroid disorders Question the patient about his cultural background and heredity The nurse obtains a social history Ask about work, exercise, diet, use of recreational drugs, alcohol use, and hobbies Also ask about stress, support systems, and coping mechanisms /H18546Physical assessment The nurse begins with inspection Observe the patient's general appearance and development, height, weight, posture, body build, proportionality of body parts, and distribution of body fat and hair Note affect, speech, level of consciousness, orientation, appropriateness of behavior, grooming and dress, and activity level Assess overall skin color, turgor, and moisture and, for areas of abnormal pigmentation, note any bruising, lesions, petechiae, or striae Assess the face for erythematous areas, noting facial expression, shape, and symmetry of the eyes; also note abnormal lid closure, eyeball protrusion, and periorbital edema, if present Inspect the tongue for color, size, lesions, tremor, and positioning Inspect the neck area for symmetry Evaluate the overall size, shape, and symmetry of the chest, noting any deformities, especially around the nipples Check for truncal obesity, supraclavicular fat pads, and PMAddison's disease 243 Inspect the external genitalia for normal development Inspect the arms and legs for tremors, muscle development and strength, symmetry, color, hair distribution, and edema Examine the feet, noting size, deformities, lesions, marks from shoes and socks, maceration, dry- ness, or ssures Next, the nurse uses palpation Palpate the thyroid gland for size, symmetry, and shape; note any nodules or irregularities Palpate the testes for size, symmetry, and shape; note any nodules or deformities Then the nurse uses Auscultate the thyroid gland to identify systolic bruits Auscultate the heart, noting heart rhythm disturbances that may occur in endocrine disorders Addison's disease /H18546Description Addison's disease is a chronic adrenocortical insuf ciency most commonly caused by autoimmune destruction of the adrenal cortex Other causes of adrenal insuf ciency include tuber- culosis; hemorrhage; metastatic disease (rarely); therapy with drugs, such ketoconazole, phenytoin, and rifampin; sudden withdrawal of steroid therapy; surgical removal of both adrenal glands; and human immunode ciency virus infection Addison's disease leads to impaired metabolism, inability to maintain a normal glucose level, and fl uid and electrolyte imbalances Primary insuf ciency results from low levels of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids; insuf ciency results from cortisol (a glucocorticoid) diminishes gluconeogenesis, decreases liver glycogen, and increases the sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin Lack of aldosteron, a mineralocorticoid, decreases the body's ability to regulate sodium, potassium, and water balance Low levels of androgens affect libido, menstrual cycles, and hair distribution Because cortisol is required for a normal stress response, patients with cortisol insuf ciency can't withstand surgical stress, trauma, or infection /H18546Signs and symptoms The patient may have a history of fatigue, muscle weakness, and weight loss The skin and mucous membranes may appear bronze from increased levels of melanocyte- stimulating hormone GI effects may include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea Other effects may include dehydration, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hypotension, and loss of axillary, extremity, and pubic hair /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Laboratory tests may show low levels of plasma and urine cortisol and elevated levels of plasma cor- ticotropin as well hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, leukocytosis, In a corticotropin stimulation test, plasma corticotropin levels may not increase in response to I.V. corticotropin Treatment consists of replacing glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids; cortisone is given in two daily doses (usually on arising and at 6 p.m.) to mimic the body's diurnal variations; doses are increased during periods of stress Treatment also includes prevention of adrenal crisis, which may develop after trauma, infection, or GI upset; prevention requires consistent replacement therapy (without abrupt withdrawal); treatment of crisis requires immediate replacement of sodium, water, and cortisone Adrenal hemorrhage after septicemia is a rare complication of Addison's disease; it's treated with aggressive antibiotic therapy, an I.V. vasopressor, and massive doses of a steroid disorders /H18546Nursing interventions Monitor the patient for signs and symptoms of adrenal crisis, such as fever, changes in GI function (which may alter drug absorption), decreased sodium and cortisol levels with increased potassium levels (which may signal an impending crisis), dehydration, headache, hypotension, nausea, severe fatigue, tachycardia, and confusion Ensure strict adherence to the medication schedule to prevent crisis Decrease environmental stressors as much as possible Teach the patient and his family how to prevent complications of Addison's disease by never omitting a dose of medication, notifying the practitioner if the patient can't take the medication, avoiding undue stress, and wearing a medical identi cation bracelet Instruct the patient and his family to report any symptoms of adrenal crisis to a practitioner Cushing's syndrome /H18546Description Cushing's syndrome is hyperfunction of the caused an overabundance of in 80% of adenoma cortical corticotropin regulation; high levels of cortisol are caused by a neoplasm in the adrenal cortex, or islet cell tumor Cushing's syndrome may be caused by abnormal cortisol production or excessive corticotropin stimulation (spontaneous disorder) or long-term glucocorticoid (such as prednisone) administration (iatrogenic disorder) For patients with this disorder, excessive cortisol leads to excessive glucose production and interferes with the cells' ability to use insulin; sodium retention, potassium excretion, and protein breakdown occur; body fat is redistributed from the arms and legs to the face, shoulders, trunk, and abdomen; and the immune system becomes less effective at preventing infection /H18546Signs and symptoms Muscle weakness and atrophy may be accompanied by fat deposits on the trunk, abdomen, over the upper back (\"buffalo hump\"), and face (\"moon face\") Skin changes may include acne, bruising, facial fl ushing, hyperpigmentation, striae, and thinning of the skin Gynecomastia may occur in men; clitoral enlargement and menstrual irregularities, in women Other effects may include arrhythmias, edema, emotional lability, GI disturbances, headaches, hirsutism ( ne, downy hair on the face and upper body), infection, vertebral fractures, and weight changes /H18546Diagnosis and treatment The dexamethasone suppression test and urine-free cortisol test are standard screening tests for Cushing's syndrome Laboratory tests may show coagulopathies, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, hypernatremia, levels; computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may show a tumor The goal of treatment is normal cortisol activity Surgery is used if a tumor is causing corticotropin release For a con rmed pituitary tumor, transsphenoidal resection is recommended; for a itary tumor, cobalt irradiation of the pituitary gland For a con rmed adrenal cortex tumor, bilateral adrenalectomy may be done; after surgery, the patient requires lifelong corticosteroid and mineralocorticoid and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone 245 Drug therapy is used if something else is causing corticotropin release; aminoglutethimide, mitotane, and adrenal hyperplasia /H18546Nursing interventions Encourage the patient to express concerns about altered body image Protect the patient from injury related to loss of bone matrix and abnormal fat distribution by main- taining a safe environment, teaching him how to use a walker or cane, encouraging the use of well- tting shoes or slippers, and attending to complaints of lower back pain or joint pain Protect the patient from injury related to easy bruising and protein wasting by avoiding unnecessary venipunctures, using paper tape for dressing changes, avoiding overinfl ation of the blood pressure cuff, keeping the skin clean and dry, and using a convoluted foam mattress, a water mattress, or an air bed for a patient with skin breakdown Provide care related to limited mobility and muscle weakness resulting from protein catabolism by planning rest periods, encouraging range-of-motion exercises or daily muscle-strengthening exercises, and referring the patient for physical therapy, if needed Protect the patient from infection related to decreased immune function by using strict aseptic tech- nique (when appropriate) and discouraging ill family members from visiting the patient Provide postoperative care after adrenalectomy, including monitoring vital signs frequently, ensuring adequate pain relief and fl uid intake and output, and monitoring for complications of hypoglycemia and signs of adrenal crisis Administer replacement medication as prescribed, and be familiar with its adverse effects Suggest that the patient wear a medical identi cation bracelet Teach the patient and his family about the disease and its treatment Diabetes insipidus and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone /H18546Description Diabetes insipidus is a de ciency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), resulting in water imbalance; vaso- pressin is a natural ADH secreted by the posterior pituitary Central diabetes insipidus results from the destruction of vasopressin-producing cells; nephrogenic diabetes insipidus results when the renal tubules don't respond to vasopressin Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) is caused by the release of excessive ADH, resulting in water retention (see Comparing diabetes insipidus and SIADH, page 246) /H18546Nursing interventions Support the patient during the water deprivation test For diabetes insipidus: Treat altered fl uid volume related to excessive urine output by maintaining fl uid and electrolyte balance, administering replacement therapy as prescribed, monitoring the patient for signs of therapy-related water intoxication, notifying the practitioner of signi cant changes in urine output and speci c gravity, and observing patient for vital sign changes related to dehydration, such as increased heart rate and decreased blood pressure For SIADH: Treat altered fl uid volume status related to water retention by weighing the patient at the same time daily, and reporting weight gains or losses to the practitioner; monitor the patient for signs of water retention, such as dyspnea, edema, hypertension, and tachycardia Provide oral and skin care, and reposition the patient frequently to prevent skin breakdown Conserve energy for a patient who is up often during the night to void or drink; encourage short naps to prevent sleep deprivation Protect the patient from injury related to fatigue, weakness, dehydration, or confusion by providing a safe environment, encouraging a weak patient to request assistance in walking to and from the bath-room, teaching a patient to sit up gradually to prevent dizziness resulting from orthostatic hypotension, and taking seizure precautions for a patient with a low serum sodium level Teach the patient and family to recognize the signs of diabetes insipidus and SIADH Teach the patient how to administer intranasal disorders chart the major characteristics of central and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and syndrome or hypothalamic tumor Intracerebral occlusion or infection Systemic diseases involving the kidney, such as multiple myeloma and sickle cell anemia Polycystic kidney disease Pyelonephritis Medications such as lithium and demeclo-cycline Central nervous system disorders, such as head trauma, infection, intercerebral hemorrhage, or tumor Pharmacologic agents, including che- motherapeutic agents, phenothiazines, and tricyclic antidepressants Respiratory disorders and treatment, such as pneumonia, pneumothorax, bron-chiogenic tumors, and positive-pressure ventilation Pathophysiology Loss of vasopressin-produc- ing cells, causing de ciency in antidiuretic hormone (ADH) synthesis or release; de ciency in ADH, resulting in an inability to conserve water, leading to extreme polyuria and polydipsia Depression of aldosterone release or inability of the neph-rons to respond to ADH, causing extreme polyuria and polydipsia Inappropriate release of ADH, causing dilutional hyponatremia, leading to cellu-lar swelling and water retention Signs and symptoms Polyuria with urine output of 5 to 15 L daily Polydipsia, especially a desire for cold fl uids Marked dehydration, as evi- denced by dry mucous mem-branes, dry skin, and weight loss Anorexia and epigastric fullness Nocturia and related fatigue from interrupted sleep Same as for central diabetes insipidus Excessive or inappropriate water reten- tion Weight gain and decreased urinary output Initially, anorexia, headaches, nausea, and vomiting Later, confusion, irritability, seizures, and coma from severe hyponatremia Diagnostic test results High serum osmolality, usually above 300 mOsm/kg of water Low urine osmolarity, usually 50 to 200 mOsm/kg of water; low urine-speci c gravity of less than 1.005 Increased creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels resulting from dehydration Positive response to water deprivation test: Urine output decreases and speci c gravity increases Same as for central diabetes insipidus, except that plasma vasopressin levels are elevated in relation to plasma osmolality, and there is no response to exogenous vaso-pressin administra-tion (decreased urine output and increased speci c gravity) Low serum osmolality High urine osmolality Low serum sodium level High urine sodium level, usually over 20 mEq/L Decreased creatinine and BUN levels Negative response to water deprivation test: Urine output increases and speci c gravity decreases Treatments Replacement vasopressin therapy with intranasal or I.V. DDAVP (desmopressin acetate) Correction of dehydration and electrolyte imbalances A thiazide diuretic to deplete sodium and increase renal water reabsorption Restriction of salt and protein intake Restriction of water intake to 1 qt (0.9 L) daily Infusions of 3% to 5% sodium chloride to replace sodium A diuretic to decrease volume overload Demeclocycline to reverse hyperosmolarityComparing mellitus is a chronic systemic disease that alters carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism; it's the most common endocrine disorder and the third leading cause of death in the United States. Four general classi cations are recognized: Prediabetes can occur when the fasting blood glucose is greater than 100 mg/dL and less than 126 mg/dL or postprandial blood glucose is greater than 140 mg/dL and less than 200 mg/dL Type 1 diabetes mellitus is an absolute de ciency of insulin secretion and may be hereditary; it's associ- ated with histocompatibility antigens, some viruses, abnormal antibodies that attack the islet of Lang-erhans cells, and toxic chemicals; it causes symptoms when 90% of the pancreatic beta cells have been destroyed Type 2 diabetes mellitus may be hereditary, is associated with obesity, and results from different causes than type 1 diabetes; it's caused by defects in insulin secretion and decreased insulin effectiveness; it accounts for 90% of diabetic patients Gestational diabetes mellitus causes glucose intolerance during pregnancy; it usually disappears after delivery but may develop into type 1 or type 2 diabetes Other types of diabetes mellitus can be linked to either a disorder (such as an endocrinopathy, a genetic syndrome, an insulin receptor disorder, or an infection) or to the use of a drug or a chemical (such as a corticosteroid, epinephrine, furosemide, glucagon, lithium, or phenytoin) Impaired glucose tolerance occurs when glucose levels are outside the normal range following a glucose tolerance test but the patient doesn't meet the criteria for diabetes mellitus Many complications are associated with diabetes mellitus Microvascular and macrovascular changes can increase the risk of heart disease, accelerate athero- sclerotic disease, and cause cerebrovascular accidents, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease Microvascular changes can thicken capillary basement membranes and cause changes in the vessels of the kidneys and eyes Motor and sensory neuropathies may result in weakness, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, and pain; autonomic neuropathy generally occurs after many years and may cause cardiac abnormalities, diabetic diarrhea, gastroparesis, impotence, and urine retention Infections can result from accumulation of serum glucose in the skin and poorly functioning white blood cells With diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia results from insulin de ciency or insulin resistance, which makes insulin unavailable to cells; the discrepancy between the amount of insulin available to tissues and the amount needed leads to impaired carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism /H18546Signs and symptoms The classic signs and symptoms are polydipsia, polyphagia, polyuria, and weight loss Other effects may include fatigue and somnolence /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis may be based on symptoms of diabetes mellitus and a casual plasma glucose level greater than 200 mg/dL, an 8-hour fasting plasma glucose level greater than 126 mg/dL, or a 2-hour postload glucose level greater than 200 mg/dL during an oral glucose tolerance test; testing must be con rmed on a subsequent day Hemoglobin A1C levels refl ect the plasma glucose level during the past 2 to 3 months The rst goal of treatment is to maintain a normal blood glucose level through oral antidiabetic or insulin therapy, diet control, and physical activity (see Treatments for diabetes mellitus, page 248) The second goal of treatment is to prevent or delay the complications Hypoglycemia (insulin shock) is a condition in which the blood glucose level falls below the level required to sustain homeostasis (usually less than or equal to 70 mg/dL); it may result from too little food, too much insulin or oral antihypoglycemics, or too much exercise and can cause permanent neurologic damage or rebound hyperglycemia antidiabetics antidiabetic may be prescribed alone or in combina- tion with another drug and/or insulin for a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A sulfonylurea and tolbutamide) works by stimulating the pancreas to release insulin but doesn't lead to hypoglycemia. Metfor-min, a biguanide, works by reducing the production of glu-cose in the liver and by making the tissues more sensitive to insulin; the drug may cause hypoglycemia. Acarbose and miglitol, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, reduce glucose levels by interfering with glucose absorption in the small intestine; when used alone, these drugs don't cause hypoglycemia. Repaglinide, a benzoic acid derivative, stimulates beta cells to produce insulin; because the drug is quickly metabolized and is short acting, it's less likely to cause hypoglycemia. Thiazolidinediones, such as pioglitazone (Actos), increase insulin sensitivity by activating genes involved in fat synthesis and carbohydrate metabolism; when used alone, the drug doesn't cause hypoglycemia. Insulin Insulin therapy may be prescribed for other diabetic patients. Regular insulin is short-acting, with an onset of 30 to 60 minutes, a peak of 1 to 5 hours, and a duration of 6 to 10 hours; lispro (Humalog) and aspart (NovoLog) are rapid-acting insulins with an onset of 5 to 25 minutes, a peak of 30 to 90 minutes, and a duration of 2 to 5 hours. Neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) or Lente insulin is used for intermediate-acting therapy. Each of these drugs begins to act in 1 to 4 hours, produces peak action in 6 to 12 hours, and produces effects for 12 to 24 hours. Protamine zinc or Ultralente insulin can be used for long-acting therapy. For these drugs, onset occurs in 4 to 8 hours, action peaks in 16 to 18 hours, and action lasts up to 30 hours. Glargine (Lantus) and detemir (Levemir) insulins are used as basal therapy. They have an onset of 2 to 4 hours, have no peak effectiveness period, and last 20 to 24 hours. An insulin pump may be used to deliver rapid-acting insulin to meet both basal and bolus needs; the pump can be implanted under the skin or worn externally. Diet Diet therapy is individualized based on metabolic, nutrition-al, and lifestyle requirements. Emphasis is placed on achiev-ing glucose, lipid, and blood pressure control. The following restrictions are recommended: Fat intake should equal 20% to 30% of total calories; protein intake, 10% to 20% of total calories; carbohydrate intake, 50% to 60% of calories; choles-terol intake, 300 mg or less; ber intake, 20 to 30 g daily; and sodium intake, 2 to 3 g daily. Physical activity Exercise lowers blood glucose levels, maintains normal cho-lesterol levels, helps blood vessels perform more effectively, and may reduce the amount of insulin needed. Therefore, the patient should follow a consistent exercise program, engaging in activity when glucose levels are high. (Carbohy-drate intake must be increased if the patient exercises when glucose levels are low.)Treatments for diabetes mellitus A patient with diabetes mellitus commonly follows a regimen that requires medications (an oral antidiabetic or insulin), diet, and physical activity. Onset occurs in minutes to hours, but most often before meals, especially if meals are delayed or snacks omitted Severe signs and symptoms may include bladder spasms; a blood glucose level less than or equal to 70 mg/dL; bradycardia; acidosis; vision disturbances; and vomiting Milder signs and symptoms may include sweating, tremor, tachycardia, palpitations, and hunger Hypoglycemia is treated with 15 g of carbohydrates (4 oz apple juice, 4 oz regular soda, 8 oz skim milk, three glucose tablets, or ve hard candies) if the patient is awake; if the patient is unconscious, treatment is an I.V. bolus of 50% dextrose solution, or glucagon given subcutaneously or I.M.; the patient requires follow-up glucose monitoring Hyperglycemia is a condition in which the blood glucose level exceeds 140 mg/dL When blood glucose exceeds 180 mg/dL, glucose is excreted in urine along with large amounts of water and electrolytes; excessive thirst, hunger, and ketosis also occur is treated with short-acting insulin and exercise to lower blood glucose levels Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) results from too little insulin, which prevents glucose from entering cells and causes it to accumulate in the blood DKA is treated with regular I.V. insulin, I.V. fl uids to supplement intravascular volume, potas- sium replacement, and sodium bicarbonate if the pH is less than 6.9 Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome (HHNS) resembles DKA, but ketoacidosis doesn't occur; the patient has enough insulin to inhibit lipolysis (see Understanding the difference between DKA and HHNS ) HHNS can be precipitated by infection, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, pancreatitis, a severe burn treated with a high concentration of sugar, stress, or therapy with thiazide diuretic, a mannitol steroid, phenytoin, or total parenteral nutrition It occurs most frequently in persons ages 50 to 70 who have no history of diabetes as well as in those with mild type 2 diabetes It's treated with insulin, I.V. fl uids with half-normal saline solution or normal saline solution, and potassium replacement when urine output is adequate /H18546Nursing interventions Protect the patient from infection and injury related to circulatory compromise and possible nerve impairment Report wounds to the practitioner for treatment Apply lanolin to the feet and ankles Carefully dry the patient's feet, especially between the toes Encourage the use of cotton socks to reduce moisture, and suggest wearing well- tting shoes Have the patient's toenails clipped by a podiatrist Teach the patient and family about good skin care Tell the patient to avoid heating pads and to exercise caution when near open res because burns are more dif cult to treat in diabetic patients Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome (HHNS), both acute complications associated with diabetes, share some similarities, including changes in level of consciousness and extreme volume depletion, but they're two distinct conditions. The following chart helps determine which condition your patient is experiencing. Associated with Onset Symptoms DKA Type 1 diabetes mellitus Rapid Hyperventilation (Kussmaul's respirations) Acetone breath odor Blood glucose level above normal (200 to 800 mg/dL) Mild hyponatremia Positive or large serum Type 2 diabetes mellitus Slow Slightly rapid respirations No breath odor Blood glucose level markedly elevated (above 600 mg/dL) Hypernatremia Negative or small serum ketones Serum osmolality markedly elevated Normal serum potassium Lack of acidosisUnderstanding the difference between DKA and I.V. isotonic (normal) or hypotonic (half-normal) saline solution When blood level falls below 200 mg/dL, administer I.V. dextrose 5% in water to prevent hypoglycemia Monitor serum glucose levels and urine output hourly; review key laboratory results, such as serum electrolyte levels, arterial pH, serum bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine, regularly to assess treatment effects Monitor potassium level, and replace potassium as needed Help the patient maintain good nutritional habits Obtain a diet history, and note the impact of lifestyle and culture on food intake Encourage the patient to follow the American Diabetes Association's calculated diet plan; encour- age the obese patient to lose weight Explain the importance of exercise and a balanced diet Teach the patient and his family about the disease, complications, and treatment Discuss blood glucose self-testing, skin care, and treatment of minor injuries; discuss which inju- ries should be reported to a practitioner Make sure the patient and his family know the signs of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia Make sure the patient and family know how to adjust insulin doses for changes in diet, exercise, and stress level Have the patient or a family member demonstrate the technique for drawing up and administering insulin Teach the patient how to adjust doses if an insulin-infusion pump is used Educate the patient and his family about care during illness; tell the patient to monitor blood glucose levels more frequently, to increase fl uid intake, and not to stop taking his antidiabetic without consulting with the practitioner Provide care for a diabetic patient with peripheral neuropathy Discuss causes of an aching or burning sensation in the legs Provide foot cradles to prevent contact with bed linens for a patient in severe pain Encourage exercise as tolerated, which may help to relieve pain Provide care for a diabetic patient with altered bowel and bladder elimination related to neuropathy by providing psychological support, administering prescribed drugs such as metoclopramide hydro-chloride, and discussing the signs of bladder infection with the patient and family Provide care for a diabetic patient with retinopathy by encouraging independence, providing a safe environment, and eliciting the support of community agencies Provide care for a patient with diabetes who has a sexual dysfunction related to neuropathy by encouraging the expression of feelings; exploring options such as a penile prosthesis; and recommending professional counseling as needed Hyperparathyroidism /H18546Description Hyperparathyroidism is characterized by a greater-than-normal secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), one of the two major hormones that modulates calcium and phosphate homeostasis; the hormone stimulates intestinal absorption of calcium and acts on bone to release calcium The disorder is classi ed as primary or secondary In primary hyperparathyroidism, one or more of the parathyroid glands enlarges (usually because of an adenoma or gland hyperplasia), causing inappropriately high PTH secretion in relation to serum calcium concentration In secondary hyperparathyroidism, the parathyroid gland responds appropriately to a reduced level of extracellular calcium; PTH concentrations rise and calcium is mobilized by increasing intesti-nal absorption Causes include adenoma, chronic renal failure, decreased intestinal absorption or insuf cient consumption of vitamin D or calcium, and genetic disorders Med-Surg_Chap14.indd 250 Med-Surg_Chap14.indd 250 8/2/2011 2:55:52 PM 8/2/2011 2:55:52 PMHyperthyroidism 251 Primary hyperparathyroidism can occur at any age but the majority of cases occur in people over age 45; women are affected twice as commonly as men, probably because the increase in bone resorption that follows menopause unmasks parathyroid gland hyperactivity Patients may have a history of irradiation to the head and neck 20 to 40 years (on average) before the development of hyperparathyroidism Complications may include osteoporosis, renal calculi development, cardiac arrhythmias, cholelithiasis, hypertension, and heart failure Hypercalcemic crisis can occur with extreme elevations of serum calcium levels and can result in life-threatening neurologic, cardiovascular, and renal complications /H18546Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms include a history of recurring nephrolithiasis; easy fracturing; osteoporosis; abdominal pain and other GI symptoms, such as anorexia, nausea, and vomiting; muscle weakness, particularly in legs; and lethargy Laboratory ndings show persistently elevated serum PTH and calcium levels, along with elevated urine calcium levels; serum phosphorus levels are decreased X-rays show diffuse bone demineralization, bone cysts, outer cortical bone absorption, and subperi- osteal erosion of the phalanges and distal clavicles in primary disease Technetium-99m sestamibi imaging, ultrasonography, CT scan, and MRI help identify enlargement and abnormally functioning areas Needle biopsy evaluates the function of the parathyroids /H18546Diagnosis and treatment The recommended treatment for primary hyperthyroidism is the surgical removal of the abnormal parathyroid tissue For secondary disease, the goal is to correct the underlying cause of parathyroid hypertrophy Other treatments include hydration therapy and dialysis for renal failure Medications include bisphosphonates such as alendronate to reduce bone turnover and maintain bone density, calcimimetics such as cinacalcet to decrease calcium and PTH levels, and loop diuretics such as furosemide to treat hypercalcemia in patients who are well-hydrated /H18546Nursing interventions Teach the patient and family about the disease and its treatment; prepare the patient for surgery if indicated, and provide emotional support Keep the patient hydrated as tolerated Monitor the patient's serum potassium, calcium, phosphate, and magnesium levels Watch for hypercalcemic crisis; be prepared to administer calcitonin and corticosteroids Postoperatively, monitor the patient's airway patency, and keep a tracheotomy tray at the patient's bedside Advance the patient's activity level and diet as tolerated Observe for signs of hypocalcemia (tetany, numbness and tingling around the mouth and in the extremities, and spasms) Before discharge, teach the patient the signs and symptoms of complications and the importance of follow-up care-including laboratory testing-to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy Hyperthyroidism /H18546Description Hyperthyroidism is the excessive production of thyroid hormone resulting in a hypermetabolic state Severe hyperthyroidism can precipitate a thyroid storm or crisis, which is a life-threatening emer- gency; the crisis can be triggered by minor trauma or stress The two types of spontaneous hyperthyroidism are Graves' disease and toxic nodular goiter; signs and symptoms vary with the type and severity of the disease (see Signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, page 252) Graves' disease commonly occurs in the third or fourth decade of life; it's more common in women than in men, it has a familial predisposition, and it may cause extrathyroidal symptoms, goiter, and symptoms of hypermetabolism and sympathetic nervous and symptoms of hypermetabolism and sympathetic overactivity) Brittle hair and friable nails Emotional lability, anxiety, and irritability Fatigue Heat intolerance Increased respiratory rate and shortness of breath Increased sweating Loss of pubic hair in women; prema- ture graying in men Muscle weakness and atrophy Tachycardia with palpitations Tremor Warm, moist skin Weight loss with increased appetiteGraves' disease (Extrathyroid signs and symptoms) Exophthalmos Eyelid lag, or a slowed movement of the lid in relation to the eyeball Periorbital edema Pretibial myxedema that produces raised, thickened skin that may be hyperpigmented, itchy, and well-demarcated from normal skin; lesions that appear or nodular Staring with decreased blinkingToxic nodular goiter Arrhythmias that don't respond to digoxin therapy Muscle wasting with weakness Staring with decreased blinking Weight loss Thyroid storm or crisis Fever, which usually precedes thyroid storm Increased blood pressure Severe tachycardia Altered mental state\u2014delirium and coma Anxiety and restlessness Chest pain General worsening of all symptomsSigns and symptoms of hyperthyroidism Different forms of hyperthyroidism can produce various signs and symptoms as summarized below. Toxic nodular goiter typically occurs in elderly people; its slow onset causes less severe symptoms than Graves' disease Hyperthyroidism can result from discontinuation or excessive use of antithyroid medication, tumors that stimulate thyroid secretion, or deterioration of a preexisting hyperthyroid state due to DKA, infec-tion, toxemia, trauma, or excessive iodine intake /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Laboratory tests show increased levels of thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine [T3] and thyrox- ine [T4]), decreased thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level, and an increased blood glucose level resulting from impaired insulin secretion Electrocardiography (ECG) shows atrial brillation, P- and T-wave alterations, and tachycardia; thyroid scan shows increased uptake of radioactive iodine The principal goal of treatment is to reduce thyroid hormone levels Antithyroid medications are generally used for pretreating patients who are elderly or who have cardiac disease before starting radioactive iodine; methimazole and propylthiouracil are slow-acting drugs that block thyroid synthesis and typically produce improvement after 2 to 4 weeks of therapy; a beta-adrenergic blocker such as propranolol may be used as an adjunct to control activity of the sympathetic nervous system Surgery (subtotal thyroidectomy) is reserved for patients with a very large gland, or who can't undergo other treatments, or who have thyroid cancer; before surgery, the patient receives antithy-roid medication to reduce hormone levels and saturated solution of potassium iodide to decrease surgical complications Radioactive iodine therapy also is the standard for treating hyperthyroidism; dosing is based on the patient's symptoms; it's contraindicated during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and many patients who receive radioactive iodine become euthyroid or hypothyroid, requiring levothyroxine treatment The second goal of treatment is to prevent thyroid storm The patient is taught to take medication (including an antipyretic) only as prescribed and to seek care for infection Med-Surg_Chap14.indd 252 Med-Surg_Chap14.indd 252 8/2/2011 2:55:52 PM 8/2/2011 2:55:52 PMHypoparathyroidism 253 Fluids are replaced as needed to prevent the condition from worsening A patient who develops thyroid storm requires immediate treatment with antipyretics and a hypo- thermia mattress, /H18546Nursing interventions Maintain normal fl uid and electrolyte balance to prevent arrhythmias Tell the patient to avoid caffeine, which can stimulate the sympathetic nervous system Provide a high-calorie, high-protein diet through several small, well-balanced meals Ensure adequate hydration Conserve the patient's energy to help decrease metabolism needs Prevent thyroid crisis by using a cooling mat to achieve normal temperature, keeping the patient's room cool, establishing a calm environment, using relaxation techniques, administering drugs as prescribed, identifying and treating precipitating factors, and teaching the patient and family how to prevent thyroid storm If the patient has exophthalmos, administer eyedrops or ointment, and encourage the use of sun- glasses for comfort and to protect his eyes If the patient has diaphoresis, keep his skin dry with powders that contain cornstarch, and frequently change his bed linens If the patient underwent a thyroidectomy, keep him in Fowler's position to promote venous return from the head; assess for signs of respiratory distress and vocal changes; keep a tracheotomy tray at the bedside; monitor him for signs of hemorrhage; assess for hypocalcemia (such as tingling and numbness of the extremities, muscle twitching, laryngeal spasm, and positive Chvostek's sign [inducing spasm or twitching of the mouth, nose, and eye by sharply tapping over the facial nerve] and Trousseau's sign [inducing carpopedal spasm by occluding ow to arm with a blood pressure cuff]), which may occur if parathyroid glands are damaged; assess for signs of thyroid storm (such as tachycardia, hyperkinesis, fever, vomiting, and hypertension); and keep calcium gluconate available for emergency I.V. administration Hypoparathyroidism /H18546Description Hypoparathyroidism occurs when the parathyroid glands don't secrete enough PTH or when there's decreased PTH action It can be acute or chronic and is classi ed as idiopathic, acquired, or reversible Hyperparathyroidism can result from inadvertent removal of the parathyroid glands during thyroid- ectomy; other causes include autoimmune disorders, radiation to the neck, neoplasms, and trauma The disorder affects men and women equally Complications include heart failure, cataracts, tetany, bone deformities, laryngospasm, and vocal cord paralysis /H18546Signs and symptoms Because parathyroid glands primarily regulate calcium balance, neuromuscular signs and symptoms range from paresthesia to tetany Numbness, tingling, and cramps in the extremities may occur, along with stiffness in the hands and feet; in overt tetany, the patient may experience and Positive Chvostek's and Trousseau's signs indicate latent tetany Other signs and symptoms of the disorder include anxiety, irritability, delirium, and ECG changes /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Increased serum phosphate and decreased serum calcium levels indicate hypoparathyroidism CT may show frontal lobe and basal ganglia calci cations X-rays show increased bone density and bone malformation Therapy aims to increase serum calcium levels to between 9 and 10 mg/dL and to eliminate symptoms Administration of parenteral parathormone helps treat acute hypoparathyroidism with functioning parathyroid glands; however, this therapy can trigger an allergic reaction Med-Surg_Chap14.indd 253 8/2/2011 2:55:52 PM 8/2/2011 2:55:52 PM254 Endocrine disorders A diet high in calcium and low in phosphorus is prescribed Calcium supplements and vitamin D are given /H18546Nursing interventions Teach the patient and family about the disease and its treatment, and provide emotional support Obtain specimens to test for serum electrolyte levels, especially serum calcium and phosphorus levels Check patient's deep tendon refl exes, and assess for Chvostek's and Trousseau's signs Keep calcium gluconate at the patient's bedside, and prepare to administer in an emergency If the patient underwent surgery, monitor his airway, and keep a tracheotomy tray at his bedside Advance the patient's activity and diet as tolerated; teach him and his family how to follow a high- calcium, low-phosphate diet Before discharge, teach the patient and his family the signs and symptoms of complications and the importance of follow-up care\u2014including laboratory testing\u2014to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy Hypothyroidism /H18546Description Hypothyroidism is the diminished production of thyroid hormone, leading to thyroid insuf ciency Primary hypothyroidism is caused as myxedema in adults, as juvenile hypothyroidism in young children, or as congenital hypothyroidism Thyroid insuf ciency causes decreased hypoventilation Unrecognized and untreated congenital hypothyroidism\u2014cretinism\u2014can result in mental and physi- cal retardation Hypothyroidism may be caused by worsening of a preexisting hypothyroid condition; insuf cient thyroid hormone gland dysfunction due to infec-tion, surgery, trauma, or tumor; autoimmune disease; iodine de ciency; and drugs (such as lithium and amiodarone) /H18546Signs and symptoms Vital sign measurements may reveal bradycardia, decreased respiratory rate with shallow inspira- Hoarseness, impaired hearing, myxedema (nonpitting edema), and a puffy face, hands, and tongue may result from swelling Crackles may stem from pleural effusion Other effects may include intolerance to cold; dry, skin; lethargy, stupor, or coma; menstrual irregularities; fatigue; alopecia; and ascites, hypothermia, pericardial effusion, and cardiogenic shock /H18546Diagnosis and may include measurement of serum TSH, T3, and T4, uptake test; and radioisotope thyroid uptake test Laboratory studies may show a decreased serum T4 level, a decreased blood glucose level, decreased plasma osmolality, a decreased TSH level (with a pituitary or hypothalamic defect) or an increased TSH level (with a thyroid defect), hyponatremia, hyperlipidemia, and lactic acidosis The primary treatment is lifelong replacement of the de cient hormone; synthetic levothyroxine sodium is the preferred thyroid hormone replacement and typically relieves symptoms in 2 to 3 days If myxedema coma develops, immediate I.V. administration of a corticosteroid, glucose, and levothy- roxine sodium can reverse this life-threatening condition /H18546Nursing interventions Administer replacement therapy as prescribed Avoid sedating the patient, which may further decrease respirations 254 8/2/2011 2:55:52 PM 8/2/2011 2:55:52 PMPheochromocytoma 255 Recognize that slower metabolism may slow drug absorption and excretion Provide frequent skin care to prevent breakdown and decrease the risk of infection Administer fl uids as prescribed; correct imbalances without causing fl uid overload Monitor fl uid intake and output, and weigh the patient daily to check for fl uid retention If the patient has hypothermia, increase body temperature gradually by using warm blankets or increasing the room temperature Encourage coughing and deep breathing, and administer oxygen as prescribed Ask the patient and his family to demonstrate their understanding of the medication schedule Give the patient and his family opportunities to ask about the disease and its treatment Provide supportive care for a patient in myxedema coma; maintain a patent airway, monitor vital signs closely, and administer oxygen and I.V. fl uid replacement until the patient begins to recover from the coma Pheochromocytoma /H18546Description Pheochromocytoma is a tumor that usually originates from the chromaf n cells of the adrenal medulla; in a minority of patients (less than 10%), it can occur in the extra-adrenal tissue located in or near the aorta, ovaries, spleen, or other organs Less than 10% of tumors are malignant Pheochromocytoma can occur at any age, but its peak incidence is from ages 40 to 50; it affects men and women equally and has a genetic association /H18546Signs and symptoms The type and severity of signs and symptoms depends on the relative proportions of epinephrine and norepinephrine secreted; approximately 8% of patients are completely asymptomatic In patients with hypertension, the typical triad of signs and symptoms is headache, diaphoresis, and palpitations; hypertension may be intermittent or persistent Other signs and symptoms may include tremor, fl ushing, anxiety, and hyperglycemia The paroxysmal form of pheochromocytoma is typically characterized by acute, unpredictable attacks that last from seconds to several hours, with symptoms typically beginning abruptly and subsiding slowly; the patient becomes extremely anxious, tremulous, and weak and may have such other symp-toms as tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and a feeling of impending doom Severe hypertension can cause serious, life-threatening complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, dissecting aneurysm, stroke, and acute renal failure Postural hypotension occurs in 70% of patients with untreated pheochromocytoma /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Pheochromocytoma is suspected in the patient with signs of sympathetic nervous system overactiv- ity, such as hypertension, headache, excessive sweating, hypermetabolism, and hyperglycemia Increased urine and plasma levels of catecholamines and metanephrine, a catecholamine metabolite, are the most direct and conclusive tests for overactivity of the adrenal medulla If urine and plasma tests of catecholamines are inconclusive, a clonidine suppression test can identify excess catecholamine release that bypasses normal storage and release mechanisms, a characteristic of pheochromocytoma Imaging studies, such as CT scanning, MRI, and ultrasonography, can localize the pheochromocyto- mas and determine whether the patient has more than one tumor Initial treatment aims to reduce blood pressure to normal levels; drugs used include alpha- adrenergic, beta-adrenergic, and calcium channel blockers and smooth muscle relaxants If other medications don't control blood pressure, catecholamine synthesis inhibitors such as metyro- sine (Demser) may be used The de nitive treatment for pheochromocytoma is surgical removal of the tumor; it's usually accom- panied by adrenalectomy A patient who has undergone bilateral adrenalectomy requires corticosteroid replacement Postoperatively, the patient's blood pressure and catecholamine levels should return to normal; if not, he should be evaluated for retention of pheochromocytoma tissue Med-Surg_Chap14.indd the patient's blood pressure, and administer antihypertensive medications as ordered Prepare the patient for surgery; ensure that he's well hydrated to prevent hypotension Manipulation of the tumor during surgical excision may cause the release of stored epinephrine and norepinephrine, with marked increases in blood pressure and heart rate changes; monitor the patient closely Administer corticosteroids as ordered to prevent adrenal insuf ciency Monitor for hypoglycemia Collect blood and urine samples for catecholamine and metabolite testing to evaluate complete tumor removal Teach the patient and family about the disease, including treatments and signs of recurrence; teach them how to monitor the patient's blood pressure at home Provide emotional support to the patient and family, who may fear repeated attacks Review questions 1. A 28-year-old woman is scheduled for a glucose tolerance test. She asks the nurse what results indicate diabetes mellitus. The nurse should respond that the minimum parameter for indication of diabetes mellitus is a 2-hour blood glucose level greater mg/dL. Correct answer: C A glucose tolerance test indicates a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus when the 2-hour blood glucose level is greater than 200 mg/dL. Con rmation occurs when at least one subsequent result is greater than 200 mg/dL. Options A and B are incorrect because they're below the minimum parameter; Option D is incorrect because it's above the minimum parameter. 2. A patient is diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. The nurse should expect clinical signs and symptoms similar to: /H18540A. hypovolemic shock. Addison's disease. Correct answer: B Hyperthyroidism is a hypermetabolic state characterized by such signs and symp- toms as anxiety, increased blood pressure, and tachycardia\u2014all seen in sympathetic nervous system stimulation. Symptoms of hypovolemic shock (Option A), benzodiazepine overdose (Option C), and Addison's disease (Option D) are more similar to a hypometabolic state. 3. A patient with thyroid cancer undergoes a thyroidectomy. After surgery, the patient develops peripheral numbness and tingling and muscle twitching and spasms. The nurse should expect to administer: /H18540A. a thyroid supplement. to parathyroid glands during thyroidectomy can cause hyposecretion of parathyroid hormone, leading to calcium de ciency. Symptoms of calcium de ciency include muscle spasms, numbness, and tingling. Treatment includes immediate I.V. administration of calcium gluconate. Thyroid supplementation (Option A) is necessary following thyroidectomy but isn't speci cally related to the identi- ed problem. An antispasmodic (Option B) doesn't treat the problem. A barbiturate (Option C) isn't indicated. 4. A patient with intractable asthma develops Cushing's syndrome. Development of this complication can most likely be attributed to long-term or excessive results from long-term or excessive use of a glucocorticoid such as prednisone. Theophylline (Option B), metaproterenol (Option C), and cromolyn (Option D) don't cause Cushing's syndrome. 5. Which nursing diagnosis is most likely for a patient with an acute episode of diabetes insipidus? /H18540A. Imbalanced nutrition: More than body requirements /H18540B. fl uid volume /H18540C. Impaired gas exchange /H18540D. Ineffective tissue perfusion: Cardiopulmonary Correct answer: B Diabetes insipidus causes a pronounced loss of intravascular volume; therefore, the most prominent risk to the patient is de cient fl uid volume. The patient is at risk for imbalanced nutri- tion, impaired gas exchange, and ineffective tissue perfusion (Options A, C, and D), but these risks stem from the de cient fl uid volume. 6. A patient presents with diaphoresis, palpitations, jitters, and tachycardia approximately 1\u00bd hours after tak- ing his regular morning insulin. Which treatment option is appropriate for this patient? /H18540A. Blood glucose level monitoring and carbohydrate administration /H18540B. Nitroglycerin administration and ECG /H18540C. Pulse oximetry monitoring and oxygen therapy /H18540D. Salt restriction, diuretic administration, and paracentesis Correct answer: A The patient is experiencing signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. It's appropri- ate to monitor his blood glucose level and administer carbohydrates to increase his blood glucose level. Nitroglycerin administration and ECG (Option B) are treatments for MI. Monitoring the patient's pulse oximetry and providing oxygen therapy (Option C) won't increase the patient's blood glucose level. Salt restriction, diuretic administration, and paracentesis (Option D) are treatments for ascites. 7. When teaching a newly diagnosed diabetic patient about diet and exercise, the nurse should teach the patient how to: /H18540A. use ber laxatives and bulk-forming agents. /H18540B. manage fl uids, proteins, and electrolytes. /H18540C. reduce calorie intake before exercising. /H18540D. manage caloric and D Diabetic patients must be taught to manage caloric goals, diet, and physical activity. Fiber laxatives and bulk-forming agents (Option A) are treatments for constipation. Managing fl uids, proteins, and electrolytes (Option B) is important for a patient with acute renal failure. The diabetic patient may need additional calories\u2014not reduced calories (Option C)\u2014before exercising. 8. A 52-year-old patient reports weight gain and fatigue. On assessment, her vital signs are a blood pressure of 120/74 mm Hg, a pulse rate of 52 beats/minute, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths/minute, and a temperature of 98\u00b0 F (36.7\u00b0 C). Laboratory results show low T 4 and T3 levels. The nurse knows these signs and symptoms are associated with which condition? B Weight gain, fatigue, and a slow pulse rate, along with decreased levels of T3 and T4\u2014 thyroid hormones that affect growth and development as well as metabolic rate-indicate hypothyroidism. Tetany (Option A) causes low calcium levels. Hyperthyroidism (Option C) results in increased levels of the T 3 and T4. Hypokalemia (Option D) is de ned as a low potassium level. 9. A patient is admitted with a diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism. Which of the following signs would the nurse expect to nd? /H18540A. Bulging eyes /H18540B. Renal calculi /H18540C. Weight gain /H18540D. Weight loss Correct answer: B Hyperparathyroidism is overproduction of parathyroid hormone, characterized by bone calci cation or renal calculi. Bulging eyes (Option A) and weight loss (Option D) are signs of hyper- thyroidism, and weight gain (Option C) is a sign of hypothyroidism. 10. A 37-year-old patient complains of muscle weakness, anorexia, and darkening of his skin. The nurse reviews his laboratory data and notes ndings of low serum sodium and high serum potassium levels. The nurse recognizes that these signs and symptoms are associated with which condition? /H18540A. Addison's disease /H18540B. storm Correct answer: A The clinical picture of Addison's disease includes muscle weakness, anorexia, darkening of the skin's pigmentation, and low sodium and high potassium levels. Cushing's syndrome (Option B) causes obesity, \"buffalo hump,\" \"moon face,\" and thin extremities. Signs of diabetes insipidus (Option C) include excretion of large volumes of dilute urine, leading to hypernatremia and dehydration. Thyroid storm (Option D) can occur with severe hyperthyroidism.

as a result, the patient is asymptomatic, and speci c concentration and dilution tests are needed to detect reduced renal function In a patient with renal insuf ciency , compensation begins to fail, and metabolic wastes build up; the degree of insuf ciency can be mild, moderate, or severe and is measured by the decreasing glomerular ltration rate (GFR) In a patient with end-stage renal disease , the kidneys can't perform their normal homeostatic functions or meet normal body demands Excess nitrogenous wastes build up in the blood Fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base abnormalities occur Dialysis or kidney transplantation is necessary to sustain life /H18546Nursing history The nurse asks the patient about the chief complaint A patient with a renal or urinary tract disorder may be experiencing output changes, such as poly- uria, oliguria, or anuria; he may also note voiding pattern changes, such as hesitancy, frequency, urgency, nocturia, or incontinence; urine color changes; or pain The patient may also see changes in voiding pattern, such as hesitancy, frequency, urgency, noctu- ria, or incontinence; urine color changes; or pain The nurse then questions the patient about his present illness Ask the patient about his symptom, including when it started, associated symptoms, location, radiation, intensity, duration, frequency, and precipitating and alleviating factors Ask about the use of prescription and over-the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, and vitamin and nutritional supplements The nurse asks about medical history Question the patient about other renal and urinary disorders, such as UTIs, kidney trauma, and kidney stones Ask about a history of other chronic illnesses that may affect the renal system, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension The nurse then assesses the family history Ask about a family history of chronic illnesses that can affect the renal system, such as hyperten- sion, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, vascular disease, or hyperlipidemia Determine whether the family history suggests a genetic predisposition to certain renal diseases such as polycystic kidney disease The nurse obtains a social history Ask about work, exercise, diet, use of recreational drugs and alcohol, and hobbies Also ask about stress, support systems, and coping mechanisms Med-Surg_Chap15.indd 259 Med-Surg_Chap15.indd 259 8/2/2011 2:57:21 and urinary tract disorders /H18546Physical assessment Nurse begins with inspection Observe the patient's overall appearance; note his mental status and behavior Examine his skin for color, turgor, intactness, edema, and texture Inspect his abdomen for size and shape, noting any abnormal markings Next, the nurse uses palpation Palpate the bladder for distention Note any areas of tenderness Then the nurse uses percussion Percuss for costovertebral tenderness Percuss the bladder to elicit tympany or dullness The nurse then uses auscultation Listen for renal artery bruits Note any bruits over the aorta, iliac, and femoral arteries Acute renal failure /H18546Description Acute renal failure is a sudden and almost complete loss of kidney function characterized by rising levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine and an inability of the kidneys to regulate fl uid and electrolyte balance; it occurs over several hours to several days Acute renal failure may be reversible\u2014or it may lead to death Prerenal failure , or prerenal azotemia, occurs when blood fl ow to the kidneys is disrupted, which causes ischemia and nephron damage It can result from a condition that decreases blood fl ow and kidney perfusion, such as hypovole- mia, hemorrhage, or burns; a condition that decreases cardiac output, such as a myocardial infarction (MI) or an arrhythmia; vascular failure related to sepsis, anaphylaxis, or severe acidosis; or an occlu-sion that obstructs renal arteries It generally can be reversed by treating the cause and restoring normal intravascular volume Intrarenal failure occurs when the renal parenchyma is damaged; when this occurs, the kidneys can't concentrate urine or excrete nitrogenous wastes Intrarenal failure can be caused by nephron damage resulting from acute tubular necrosis, acute glomerulonephritis, or a related disorder or from exposure to a nephrotoxic drug or chemical, such as certain antibiotics, an antineoplastic, a fl uorinated anesthetic, a heavy metal, or a radiographic contrast dye Other causes include trauma, neoplasms, hypertension, systemic lupus erythematosus, toxemia azotemia, occurs when urine fl ow from the collecting ducts in the kidney to the external urethral ori ce is obstructed or when venous blood fl ow from the kidney is obstructed Renal calculi, tumors, clots, benign prostatic hyperplasia, strictures, trauma, bilateral congenital malformation can all cause urinary obstruction Postrenal failure is usually reversible Acute renal failure can lead to hyperkalemia or can cause uremia that compromises the immune system /H18546Signs and symptoms Acute renal failure typically progresses through three phases: an oliguric or anuric phase, a diuretic phase, and a recovery phase; signs and symptoms vary from phase to phase The oliguric phase produces a BUN level of 25 to 30 mg/dL, a serum creatinine level of 1.5 to 2 mg, sudden oliguria (urine output less than 400 mL daily) or anuria (rare), and reduced GFR The diuretic phase causes a gradual return of renal function; normal or high urine output (1 to 5 L daily); potentially life-threatening loss of sodium, potassium, and magnesium; and increased azotemia (elevated BUN and serum 2:57:21 PMAcute renal failure 261 The recovery phase is associated with decreasing BUN and serum creatinine levels; it continues until normal renal tubular function is established High-output renal failure, a type of acute nonoliguric renal failure, occasionally occurs; it commonly results from the use of a nephrotoxic antibiotic Although symptoms of acute renal failure may develop, fl uid overload generally isn't a problem If high-output renal failure is recognized early, and the antibiotic is discontinued, normal renal function gradually returns /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis of acute renal failure is based on patient history and abnormal laboratory ndings (see Understanding acute renal failure ), assessment of fl uid balance, preexisting disorders, precipitating events, and current health status Other diagnostic tests may include abdominal X-ray, ultrasonography, or renal biopsy The pathophysiologic processes of acute renal failure (ARF) determine the patient's signs, symptoms, and laboratory test result changes.

dry, itchy skin Altered platelet function, anemiaUnderstanding acute renal 8/2/2011 2:57:21 tract disorders Laboratory tests include serum creatinine and BUN levels (the normal ratio of BUN to creatinine ranges from 10:1 to 15:1), electrolyte and hemoglobin levels, hematocrit, urinalysis, and clearance; changes can help differentiate among prerenal, intrarenal, and postrenal acute renal failure With prerenal acute renal failure, the BUN-creatinine ratio is greater than 15:1; urine speci c grav- ity and osmolarity are increased, and the urine sodium level is decreased With intrarenal acute renal failure, urine speci c gravity and osmolarity fall to levels similar to those in serum or plasma, and the urine sodium level may exceed 30 mEq/L With postrenal acute renal failure, urine osmolarity and sodium levels may be normal; if the condi- tion isn't quickly diagnosed and treated, the patient may develop urinary system changes similar to those of intrarenal acute renal failure Treatment aims to identify and eliminate or control the underlying cause, restore normal fl uid and electrolyte balance, and prevent uremic complications while the kidneys repair themselves Reduced intravascular volume is treated early with aggressive fl uid therapy to restore urine output and prevent acute tubular necrosis A therapeutic fl uid challenge (500 mL over 30 minutes) may be used to differentiate prerenal from intrarenal causes of oliguria If urine output improves after the fl uid challenge, I.V. fl uids are continued at a rate that maintains adequate hourly urine volume If the fl uid challenge is unsuccessful, a (Edecrin)\u2014may used to restore urine output A patient with hypervolemia and fl uid encephalopathy, or pericarditis dialysis (see Comparing types of dialysis ) Hyperkalemia is aggressively treated with I.V. hypertonic glucose and insulin (to shift extracellular potassium into cells), oral or rectal administration of the cation-exchange resin sodium polystyrene sul-fonate (to exchange sodium for potassium ions in the GI tract), and dialysis (to maintain normal potas-sium levels); hyperkalemic patients with electrocardiogram changes are commonly treated with I.V. calcium gluconate to prevent arrhythmias Hypotension is commonly treated with volume replacement, although a vasopressor may be needed Hypertension is treated with restriction of fl uid intake to prevent fl uid overload, restriction of dietary sodium, and antihypertensive therapy Diet therapy helps manage acute renal failure; the recommended diet is high in calories and carbohy- drates, is low in potassium, and may restrict protein (depending on the degree of azotemia and the fre-quency of dialysis); protein in the diet must provide essential amino acids while minimizing the degree of nitrogenous waste products /H18546Nursing interventions Monitor for signs of acute renal failure and its complications Monitor fl uid intake and output, weigh the patient daily, and administer fl uids carefully; monitor electrolyte levels, and maintain proper electrolyte balance Prevent infection by frequently washing your hands; using aseptic technique with incisions, wound care, and care of I.V. and central venous catheters; assisting the patient with hygiene, including oral hygiene; frequently turning and positioning him; encouraging deep breathing, coughing, and ambula-tion (if possible); and avoiding use of an indwelling urinary catheter Monitor the patient for signs of infection, such as fever, local redness, swelling, heat, drainage, and elevated white blood cell (WBC) count; watch for signs and symptoms of pericarditis, including pleu-ritic chest pain, tachycardia, and pericardial friction rub Provide a diet high in calories and low in potassium, protein, and sodium Monitor the patient's response to medications; because many drugs are excreted by the kidneys, the type of drug, dosage, or administration interval may need to be adjusted, based on the patient's renal function (as evidenced by GFR and other indicators) Teach the patient and family the reasons for interventions and the importance of infection-prevention measures; because the patient may be acutely ill and have a decreased level of consciousness, informa-tion should be given verbally (briefl y) and in writing Encourage the patient and family to express their concerns Med-Surg_Chap15.indd 262 Med-Surg_Chap15.indd 262 8/2/2011 2:57:21 PM 8/2/2011 2:57:21 PMChronic renal failure 263 Selection criteria Peritoneal dialysis typically is used for patients with cardio- vascular instability because it doesn't have the same effect on cardiac output as hemodialysis. It also may be used for patients with recent cerebral bleeding, GI bleeding, or blood dyscrasias because it requires no heparinization.Hemodialysis is more appropriate for patients who have had recent abdominal surgery or who have abdominal adhe-sions because these conditions interfere with the clearance ability of the peritoneal membrane used as the dialyzable surface in peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis also is more commonly used for patients with severe catabolism, fl uid overload, or hyperkalemia because it removes wastes and fl uids more rapidly than peritoneal dialysis. CRRT may be used for critically ill patients with acute renal failure who can't tolerate hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis because of hemodynamic instability. CRRT is used 24 hours per day, over several days, to slowly remove fl uid and solutes. Advantages and disadvantages Hemodialysis is a complex procedure that requires expen-sive equipment and skilled personnel. Consequently, it may not be available in a convenient location. Peritoneal dialysis is less complex and less expensive and is available in a wider variety of settings. Home dialysis is possible with both procedures, but peritoneal dialysis is less expensive and re-quires a shorter training period. Peritoneal dialysis allows the patient to be more inde- pendent, promotes more steady blood chemistry levels, and permits the patient to eat a less-restricted diet. Techniques developed by Popovich in the late 1970s, along with Tenck-hoff's development of a permanent peritoneal catheter, have contributed to the increased use of peritoneal dialysis in patients with chronic renal failure. CRRT removes fl uid and solutes slowly, making it more suitable for critically ill patients with unstable conditions. However, it requires a highly trained staff. Types of CRRT include continuous venovenous hemodialysis. Types of peritoneal dialysis Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) can be performed independently by the patient in any location and frees him from dependence on a machine or dialysis center. With CAPD, dialysis fl uid is continuously present in the peri- toneum but is drained and replaced with fresh fl uid three to ve times per day based on the patient's clearance needs. This technique closely resembles normal renal function, avoiding extreme shifts in blood chemistries and fl uid that occur with hemodialysis. In continuous cyclic peritoneal dialysis (CCPD), a cycling machine performs frequent exchanges while the patient sleeps. After the last exchange in the morning, fresh dialy-sate is left in the peritoneum until nighttime. CCPD generally is performed 6 or 7 days a week. With intermittent peritoneal dialysis (IPD), frequent fl uid changes are performed over 8 to 10 hours, 3 to 5 days a week. Dialysate isn't left in the peritoneum between dialysis periods. Although IPD can be done manually by a trained nurse, an automated cycling machine is commonly used. IPD is per-formed in a hospital, dialysis center, or at home, usually at night.Comparing types of dialysis Peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, and continuous renal replacement ther apy (CRRT) may be used to treat acute renal failure. They vary in several ways. Chronic renal failure /H18546Description Chronic renal failure is a slow, insidious, irreversible deterioration in renal function It typically progresses through four stages: Reduced renal reserve: GFR of 60% normal End-stage renal disease: GFR less than 15% of normal Diseases that contribute to chronic renal failure include diabetic, gouty, and hypertensive nephropa- tuberculosis; and sarcoidosis Chronic renal failure begins with a functional loss of nephrons that's asymptomatic, except for decreased urinary creatinine clearance; creatinine clearance normally ranges from 85 to 135 mL/minute; in patients with mild renal failure, it ranges from 50 to 84 mL/minute; in patients with moderate renal failure, from 10 to 49 mL/minute; and in patients with severe renal failure, 10 mL/minute or less Med-Surg_Chap15.indd 263 Med-Surg_Chap15.indd Next, renal occurs as more nephrons cease to function; insuf ciency may be mild, mod- erate, or severe At rst, the patient experiences no physical limitations in daily activity, although laboratory changes\u2014such as azotemia, anemia, and loss of the ability to concentrate urine\u2014are detectable As renal deterioration continues, the kidneys' ability to function under stress (for example, during dehydration, salt depletion, or heart failure) is impaired; renal insuf ciency may progress to renal failure during periods of stress Once renal failure develops, the patient must limit daily activities; he'll eventually develop overt signs of renal failure and uremia, beginning with fl uid, electrolyte, and metabolic anemia, metabolic acidosis, hypertension, and hypocalcemia) End-stage renal disease occurs when most of the nephrons have been irreversibly damaged; the GFR falls below 100 mL/minute, and the patient requires long-term dialysis or kidney transplantation /H18546Signs and symptoms Altered fl uid, electrolyte, and acid-base balances may include dehydration (early) or overhydration (later in the disease), hypocalcemia and hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis (as evidenced by low arterial blood pH and decreased bicarbonate levels) Skin changes may include gray-bronze or yellow skin color related to uremia or pallor related to anemia, dry skin, uremic frost (white, dustlike deposits of urea and phosphate crystals on the face, nose, forehead, and upper trunk), pruritus, excoriations, ecchymosis, purpura, or infections; related changes may include thin, brittle nails and a whitened proximal section with a darker distal edge and nail ridges Cardiovascular effects may include hypertension, acceleration of atherosclerosis, increased risk of MI and stroke, left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, pericarditis (which may cause a fever and peri-cardial friction rub and, rarely, chest pain and hypotension), pericardial effusion (which causes disap-pearance of any friction rub and appearance of a paradoxical pulse), cardiac tamponade (which causes hypotension, muffl ed heart sounds, narrowed pulse pressure, weak peripheral pulses, and bulging neck veins), life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest Respiratory effects may include thick, tenacious sputum and a depressed cough refl ex, which increase the risk of pulmonary infections and complications; Kussmaul's respirations; uremic breath odor; (which causes fatigue, weak- ness, pallor, exertional dyspnea, and intolerance of activity and cold); platelet dysfunction (which causes prolonged bleeding time, clotting abnormalities, easy bruising, purpura, and bleeding from mucous membranes and other body parts); and changes in the immune system and granulocytic func-tion (which decrease cellular and humoral immunity and the infl ammatory response) GI effects may include a metallic or ammonia-like taste in the mouth, stomatitis, ammonia or shy breath odor, an increased incidence of oral infections and tooth decay, anorexia (especially for high-protein foods), nausea, vomiting, GI bleeding, increased gastric acid production, diarrhea or constipa-tion, fecal impaction, and an increased incidence of diverticulosis The patient may develop hepatitis (see Chapter 12, Gastrointestinal disorders, for information about this disease) Metabolic dysfunction may include carbohydrate intolerance (with abnormal glucose clearance), accumulation of end products of protein metabolism (which causes lethargy, headache, fatigue, irrita-bility, and depression), and hyperlipidemia Central nervous system effects may include decreased attention span, memory problems, inability to think clearly (progressing to actual confusion), fl attened affect, depression, irritability, lability, stupor, coma, and seizures Peripheral nervous system effects may include peripheral neuropathies (numbness, tingling, or pain of the feet and hands; weakness of the feet; and atrophy of leg muscles), footdrop, loss of motor func-tion, and \"burning feet\" syndrome (swelling, redness, and extreme tenderness of the soles and dorsum of the feet) Med-Surg_Chap15.indd 264 Med-Surg_Chap15.indd 264 8/2/2011 2:57:21 PMChronic renal failure 265 Autonomic nervous system effects may include loss of the ability to compensate for a change in blood pressure through refl ex tachycardia or bradycardia, which leads to poor blood pressure control Musculoskeletal effects may include impaired physical mobility, loss of muscle mass and muscle strength, osteomalacia, osteoporosis, and osteitis brosa cystica Reproductive effects may include impotence in men, amenorrhea and infertility in women, and markedly decreased libido in both sexes /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Laboratory tests, X-rays, and other diagnostic tests for chronic renal failure are the same as those for acute renal failure; renal biopsy establishes the percentage of functioning nephrons Treatment has several goals: to preserve current renal function and prevent or delay further deterio- ration of function, to treat symptoms of uremia, to postpone or eliminate the need for long-term dialy-sis or kidney transplantation, to prevent complications of uremia, and to promote comfort and improve the patient's quality of life Most patients with chronic renal failure can be managed successfully with diet and fl uid therapy; long-term dialysis or kidney transplantation is unnecessary until the GFR falls to 10% to 15% of the nor-mal rate Strict adherence to a low-protein diet can delay progression to end-stage renal disease A high-protein load causes the kidneys to dilate from increased blood fl ow and increased GFR in an attempt to clear the by-products of protein metabolism; this increased vasodilation accelerates the deterioration of renal function For adult patients, a protein intake of about 50 g daily appears to have a therapeutic effect without contributing to malnutrition; most of the protein must be of high biological value to supply suf cient essential amino acids; protein of low biological value increases the waste load to the kidneys Depending on the stage of the disease and on fl uid and electrolyte alterations, fl uid intake may need to be restricted If urine output is decreased, and fl uid overload becomes a problem, fl uid intake typically is restricted to the previous day's urine output plus 500 mL for insensible loss If excessive fl uid is lost\u2014for example, because of fever, vomiting, or diarrhea\u2014fl uid requirements may increase Sodium, potassium, and phosphorus also may be restricted Sodium restriction may be warranted if the patient develops hypertension, edema, or heart failure Dietary potassium generally isn't restricted if the urine output exceeds 1,000 mL daily; it's restricted if the serum potassium level exceeds 5.5 mEq/L Supplements of B-complex vitamins, folic acid, and vitamin C may be needed to compensate for de - ciencies that result from a restrictive diet or dialysis; iron and zinc supplements also may be prescribed Once long-term dialysis begins, a more liberal protein intake is allowed, and the fl uid intake is con- trolled to allow a weight gain of 2 to 2.5 lb (0.9 to 1.1 kg) between dialysis treatments Despite anorexia, nausea, and taste changes, the patient must consume suf cient calories to prevent catabolism and muscle breakdown Disturbances in calcium metabolism may be managed with calcium supplements, dietary restriction of phosphorus, and phosphate binders, such as aluminum hydroxide gels (Amphojel), which are given at mealtimes; a patient receiving hemodialysis may receive calcium carbonate instead of a phosphate binder, which can exacerbate bone disease and promote faulty mineralization When end-stage renal disease develops, and diet, fl uid restrictions, and drugs are no longer effective, the patient may undergo long-term dialysis (peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis) or kidney transplanta-tion; peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis achieve the same results but in different ways /H18546Nursing interventions Monitor physiologic changes and fl uid and electrolyte changes Consult the dietitian about ways to ensure that the patient consumes suf cient calories while adher- ing to dietary restrictions Teach the patient how to relieve uremic skin symptoms; dry, itchy skin contributes to discomfort, irritability, restlessness, and frustration, and scratching increases the risk of infection Med-Surg_Chap15.indd 265 Med-Surg_Chap15.indd 265 8/2/2011 2:57:22 PM and urinary tract disorders Use tepid water and avoid soap (hot water and soap can worsen dryness and itching); use emol- lients, creams, and bath oils liberally to control dryness Administer antihistamines and antipruritics as needed to control itching Keep the patient's nails clean and trimmed short to reduce the risk of infection from scratching; tell the patient to use a soft washcloth, not ngernails, to scratch Keep the patient's hair clean and moisturized but avoid frequent shampooing to prevent dryness Teach the patient how to perform oral care; decreased salivary fl ow and fl uid restrictions can contrib- ute to problems in the oral mucosa Encourage frequent and gentle brushing with a soft toothbrush to decrease oral bacteria, prevent stomatitis, improve taste, and eliminate mouth odors Encourage the patient to use mouthwash and to suck on hard candy to treat dry mouth, alleviate thirst, and improve taste Teach the patient how to prevent constipation by encouraging increased intake of dietary ber, use of stool softeners, and increased activity; advise him to avoid laxatives that contain magnesium because of the risk of magnesium toxicity Help the patient increase mobility and activity as tolerated\u2014for example, help him plan activi- ties to avoid fatigue, teach him how to use ambulatory aids, and refer him to a physical therapist if needed Help prevent pulmonary complications by teaching the patient how to deep-breathe, cough, and use an incentive spirometer to prevent atelectasis and infection and by preventing and treating fl uid overload Teach the patient and family about the disease, its complications, and measures that can prevent fur- ther renal deterioration; refer the patient to the National Kidney Foundation Make sure the following areas are discussed with the patient and family: monitoring of fl uid intake and output; signs of fl uid overload and common electrolyte imbalances; therapeutic and adverse effects of prescribed drugs; methods of promoting skin integrity; methods of preventing infection, pulmo-nary complications, hyperkalemia, constipation, and fecal impaction; importance of controlling blood pressure; methods of maintaining mobility; need for phosphate-binders to prevent bone disease; need for dietary modi cations; advantages and disadvantages of peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis; and home dialysis Glomerulonephritis /H18546Description Glomerulonephritis is an of the glomeruli Acute glomerulonephritis follows a streptococcal infection of the respiratory tract or, less commonly, a skin infection, such as impetigo, immunoglobulin A nephropathy (Berger's disease) or lipid nephro-sis; most people fully recover, but others may progress to chronic renal failure Chronic glomerulonephritis is a slowly progressive disease that results in sclerosis, scarring and, eventually, renal failure /H18546Signs and symptoms The patient with acute glomerulonephritis may experience azotemia, dyspnea, edema, fatigue, hema- and proteinuria Chronic glomerulonephritis develops insidiously and without symptoms, typically over many years; when it becomes suddenly aggressive, the patient may have edema and hypertension; in later stages, the patient may complain of nausea, vomiting, pruritus, dyspnea, malaise, fatigue, and mild to severe edema /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Urinalysis typically reveals proteinuria, hematuria, WBCs, and casts A 24-hour urine sample shows low creatinine clearance and impaired glomerular ltration Blood studies reveal rising BUN and serum creatinine levels in those with advanced renal insuf - ciency as well as a decrease in hemoglobin levels Renal biopsy can con rm the diagnosis and identify underlying disease Med-Surg_Chap15.indd 266 Med-Surg_Chap15.indd 266 8/2/2011 B titers, and low serum com- plement levels verify recent streptococcal infection Treatment depends on the cause; the goals are to correct fl uid overload, hypertension, and uremia Antibiotics are given to treat streptococcal infections Antihypertensives are given to control hypertension Diuretics may be given to reduce fl uid overload Sodium, potassium, protein, and fl uid restrictions may be instituted Dialysis may be necessary to correct fl uid and electrolyte imbalances Dialysis or kidney transplantation for chronic glomerulonephritis may be needed /H18546Nursing interventions Check vital signs and electrolyte levels, monitor fl uid intake and output and daily weight, assess renal function daily through serum creatinine and BUN levels and urine creatinine clearance, and watch for signs of acute renal failure, including oliguria, azotemia, and acidosis Consult the dietitian to provide a diet high in calories and low in protein, sodium, potassium, and fl uids Provide bed rest during the acute period of the disease Provide emotional support for the patient and family; if the patient is receiving dialysis, explain the procedure Teach the patient to report signs and symptoms of infection to the practitioner and the importance of follow-up examinations Explain any dietary restrictions to the patient and family Nephrotic syndrome /H18546Description Nephrotic syndrome is a type of renal failure characterized by increased glomerular permeability, marked proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema Prognosis varies depending on the underlying cause; some forms progress to end-stage renal failure Nephrotic syndrome can result from many intrinsic renal and systemic diseases that cause glomeru- lar damage; causes include glomerulonephritis; certain neoplastic diseases such multiple bronchogenic, breast, lymphomas; mellitus /H18546Signs and symptoms Edema is the major manifestation; it's typically soft and pitting and commonly occurs around the eyes, in dependent areas, and on the abdomen Other signs and symptoms include weight gain, dyspnea, orthostatic hypotension, and treatment Proteinuria that exceeds 35 g/day is a hallmark of the disorder Urinalysis reveals an increased number of hyaline, granular, waxy, fatty casts; oval fat bodies; and consistent, heavy proteinuria (levels greater than 30 mg/dL for 24 hours) Serum cholesterol, phospholipid, and triglyceride levels are elevated, and the serum albumin level is decreased A needle biopsy of the kidney can con rm the diagnosis Treatment focuses on treating the underlying disease state responsible for proteinuria and relieving symptoms Drug treatment includes diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and anti-lipid agents; the patient should also follow a high-protein, low-sodium diet /H18546Nursing interventions Teach the patient and family about the disease and its treatment; provide support Weigh the patient and measure his abdominal girth daily Monitor the patient's fl uid and electrolyte status Administer medications as ordered, and note the patient's response Med-Surg_Chap15.indd 267 Med-Surg_Chap15.indd Provide a low-cholesterol, no-added-salt diet with adequate protein; if appropriate, encourage the patient to consume foods high in potassium Obtain urine specimens for testing to evaluate the degree of proteinuria Teach the patient about follow-up care, and tell him to report any exacerbation of his symptoms Neurogenic bladder /H18546Description Neurogenic bladder refers to all types of bladder dysfunction caused by an interruption of normal bladder innervation (see Types of neurogenic bladder ) Subsequent complications include incontinence, residual urine retention, UTI, stone formation, and renal failure A neurogenic bladder may be described as spastic (resulting from an upper motor neuron lesion) or fl accid (resulting from a lower motor neuron lesion) Neurogenic bladder may result from an acute infectious disease; a cerebral disorder; chronic alcohol- ism; a collagen disease; a peripheral innervation disorder; distant effects of cancer, such as primary oat cell carcinoma of the lung; heavy metal toxicity; herpes zoster; trauma; a vascular disease, such as atherosclerosis; or another condition /H18546Signs and symptoms A patient with fl accid experience overfl ow incontinence, diminished anal sphincter tone, and a distended bladder A patient with spastic neurogenic bladder may experience spontaneous spasms of the arms and legs, involuntary or frequent scanty urination without a feeling of bladder fullness, and increased anal sphincter tone Other signs and symptoms hydronephrosis, incontinence, and vesi- coureteral refl ux (passage of urine from the bladder back into a ureter) The patient may also have symptoms of a UTI or kidney stones /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Voiding cystourethrography evaluates bladder neck function, vesicoureteral refl ux, and continence Different types of neurogenic bladder have varied causes as summarized below. Neural lesion Type Cause Upper motor Uninhibited Lack of voluntary control in infancy Multiple sclerosis Refl ex or automatic Spinal cord transection Cord tumors Multiple sclerosis Lower motor Autonomous Sacral cord trauma Tumors Herniated disk Abdominal surgery with transection of pelvic parasympathetic nerves Motor paralysis Lesions at levels S2, S3, S4 Poliomyelitis Trauma Tumors Sensory paralysis les, and sphincter electromyography\u2014help evaluate how urine is stored in the bladder, how well the bladder empties, and how quickly urine moves out of the bladder during voiding Techniques for bladder elimination include Valsalva's maneuver, indwelling urinary catheter inser- tion, intermittent self-catheterization, and Crede's maneuver (pressing on the suprapubic area with a downward motion to express urine from the bladder) Drug therapy may include terazosin, doxazosin, and phenoxybenzamine to avoxate, dicyclomine, imipramine, and pseudoephedrine to aid urine storage When conservative treatment fails, surgery may be used to correct the structural impairment through transurethral resection of the bladder neck, urethral dilation, urinary may be necessary if permanent incontinence follows surgery /H18546Nursing interventions Use strict aseptic technique during insertion and maintenance of an indwelling urinary catheter; don't interrupt the closed drainage system for any reason; keep the drainage bag below the level of the bladder Assess the patient for signs and symptoms of infection Teach the patient to report signs and symptoms of infection and how to prevent UTI; encourage him to increase his fl uid intake Teach dietary measures to prevent kidney stone formation Keep the patient as mobile as possible; perform range-of-motion exercises, if necessary Teach the patient techniques, such as Crede's maneuver and intermittent self-catheterization If a urinary diversion procedure is to be performed, arrange for consultation with an enterostomal therapist Urinary calculi /H18546Description Urinary calculi adults; nephrolithiasis is the pres- ence of calculi in the renal parenchyma, urolithiasis is the presence of calculi in the urinary tract, and ureterolithiasis is the presence of calculi in the ureters Calculi vary in size, from the size of a grain of sand to the size of a baseball; they're more common in men than in women, more common in hot summer months, and often recur Urinary calculi vary in type and composition (see Types of urinary calculi, page 270) Urinary calculi may be caused by infection, urine retention, urinary stasis, immobility, dehydration, sedentary lifestyle, or persistently low urine output The exact mechanism of stone formation is unknown; it may be related to changes in urine pH, vol- ume depletion, or use of diuretics or other drugs Calculi formed in the kidney may pass into the ureter, occlude the fl ow of urine, and cause urine to fl ow back to the kidney; this can lead to ureteral spasm, hematuria, urinary stasis, impaired renal function and, eventually, hydronephrosis (kidney enlargement) /H18546Signs and symptoms Symptoms vary with the location of the calculi and the presence of obstruction, infection, and edema Small or large nonobstructing stones in the renal calyces or renal pelvis may cause no symptoms Obstructing stones in the renal calyces or renal pelvis can cause recurrent infection, fl ank pain (described as a constant, intense, deep, dull ache), hematuria, and hydronephrosis; pyelonephritis and gram-negative septicemia may occur Renal calculi that pass into the ureter or become lodged at the ureteropelvic junction result in severe, sometimes excruciating, colicky pain in the lumbar area; microscopic or gross hematuria occurs Extremely small renal calculi may pass through the urinary system without causing noticeable symptoms Bladder calculi usually cause irritation and infl ammation or, if they obstruct the urethra, urine reten- tion and urinary obstruction Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and tract disorders Different types of calculi vary in chemical content, incidence, and predisposing factors. Calculi and description Predisposing factors Calcium calculi Formed from calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, or both and account for 80% to 90% of all urinary calculi Immobility Hyperthyroidism Myeloproliferative disease Renal tubular acidosis Hyperuricemia Increased dietary intake of milk, alkali products (such as antacids), and vitamin D Prolonged use of steroids Oxalate calculi Formed from oxalate and are the second most common type of calculi High intake of grains Infl ammatory bowel disease Ileostomy Uric acid calculi from uric acid and account for 5% to 10% of calculi in the United States Hyperuricemia Gout High dietary intake of purine-rich foods, such as herring, sardines, organ meats, and yeast Struvite (staghorn) calculi Formed from magnesium ammonium phosphate and 1% to 4% of urinary calculi Chronic urinary tract by as Proteus, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, and Staphylococcus Cystine Formed for 1% to 4% of urinary calculi Genetic defect in the renal transport of cystine Xanthine calculi Formed from xanthine and are rare Hereditary causes xanthine oxidase de ciencyTypes of urinary calculi /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Abdominal X-ray or X-ray of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder can detect calculi; ultrasonography, nephrotomography, and excretory urography also may be used Other diagnostic tests may include urinalysis and urine culture; serum calcium, and cystine (using a 24-hour specimen) Because the causes and treatment of urinary calculi are based on their chemical composition, recov- ered stones are usually analyzed The main goals of treatment are to relieve pain, prevent nephron destruction, eliminate calculi, and prevent recurrence Opioids, such as morphine sulfate and meperidine, and oxybutynin chlo- ride (Ditropan) bromide, are used to control severe pain; antiemetics are used when pain is accompanied by nausea and vomiting Nephron destruction is prevented by controlling infection and by removing obstructions to urine fl ow to prevent backfl ow; urosepsis (septicemia related to UTI) is prevented with antibi- otic therapy Because almost 90% of urinary calculi pass spontaneously, calculi that aren't causing renal damage, obstruction, or infection are left in place for several months in the hope that they'll pass spontaneously Med-Surg_Chap15.indd 2:57:22 PMUrinary calculi 271 Depending on the underlying causes and chemical composition of the calculi, dietary modi ca- tions and drug therapy may be used to help prevent recurrence; a fl uid intake of 3 to 4 qt (3 to 4 L) daily is recommended, regardless of the type of calculi Procedures to remove renal calculi include extracorporeal stone removal, and percutaneous nephrolithotomy Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy is the most commonly used procedure to treat urinary calculi In this procedure, ultrasonic shock waves pulverize the calculi into many small fragments that pass through the urinary tract over several months The procedure has reduced the need for surgery and endoscopy to treat urinary calculi Percutaneous nephrolithotomy is used for removing large or inaccessible stones A nephroscope is inserted through an incision to the kidney, where the stone is removed Ultrasound may be needed to break up larger stones Ureteroscopic stone removal may be used for stones in the ureters A ber-optic ureteroscope is passed through the urethra and bladder into the ureters The calculi is then removed or treated with shock waves /H18546Nursing interventions Promote comfort for the patient with renal calculi Administer opioid analgesics, antispasmodics, and antiemetics, as prescribed Give hot baths or apply warm, moist packs to promote relaxation Administer 3 to 4 qt (3 to 4 L) of fl uids daily to help calculi passage; use the patient can't tolerate oral fl uids Encourage the patient to participate in usual activities and to ambulate frequently; these actions promote calculi passage Prevent urinary obstruction and infection Teach the patient the importance of monitoring urine output for changes in voiding pattern or amount and for cloudiness, foul odor, and blood Tell the patient to promptly report signs of UTI and fl ank, lumbar, and abdominal pain to the practitioner Teach the patient the importance of completing the full course of antibiotic therapy and the need to maintain fl uid intake at 2 to 3 qt (2 to 3 L) daily to promote dilution and rapid drug excretion Encourage the patient to increase daily fl uid intake to 3 qt (3 L) or more to promote urine fl ow, dilute crystalloids in the urine, and prevent precipitation of crystalloids into stones Encourage the patient with calcium-containing calculi to increase fl uid intake 2 to 4 hours after meals, during heavy physical activity and dehydration, and at night; urine is more likely to be satu-rated with calcium at these times Prevent urinary calculi from recurring Encourage increased fl uid intake to prevent urinary stasis and calculi development Instruct the patient to strain the urine to recover the calculi Teach the patient about predisposing factors, such as dehydration, low urine output, prolonged immobilization, and UTI Teach the patient with phosphate or uric acid stones how to monitor urine pH and alkalinize or acidify his urine Provide instructions about diet and prescribed drugs for a patient with calcium calculi Reduce dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D, which prevents parathyroid hormone production Restrict sodium intake to reduce intestinal absorption of calcium Limit re ned carbohydrates and animal protein to decrease hypercalciuria Encourage the intake of high- ber foods to help bind calcium Suggest the use of orthophosphates to decrease the incidence of recurrent calculi formation in patients with hypercalciuria tract Administer thiazide diuretics, as prescribed, to increase calcium reabsorption in the kidneys and reduce calcium excretion Administer sodium cellulose phosphate, which binds calcium in the intestinal tract, to lower the urinary calcium level If the patient has phosphate calculi, provide instructions about diet and prescribed drugs Because phosphate stones develop in alkaline urine, encourage the intake of ascorbic acid, cran- berry and prune juices, plums, meats, eggs, and sh to maintain acid urine Use an aluminum hydroxide gel, which combines with excess phosphorus and increases phos- phorus excretion through the intestines If the patient has oxalate calculi, provide instructions about diet and prescribed drugs Restrict the intake of oxalate-rich foods and drinks, including apples, asparagus, beans, beer, chocolate, citrus fruits, colas, cranberries, grapes, green leafy vegetables (such as spinach and cab-bage), instant coffee, peanut butter, peanuts, rhubarb, and tea Make sure the patient's urine remains diluted to prevent more calculi from developing Administer an antacid that contains aluminum to help bind oxalate and prevent urinary excretion If the patient has uric acid calculi, provide instructions about diet and prescribed drugs Recommend a low-purine diet that avoids sh (including shell sh), red wine, and rich foods, such as organ meats and foods with heavy sauces If the patient has gout, restrict dietary intake of protein Because uric acid stones are less likely to form in alkaline urine, encourage the use of sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate solutions to maintain alkaline urine If the patient has struvite calculi, provide instructions about diet and prescribed drugs Make sure that the patient receives prompt treatment for UTIs and that measures are taken to reduce the incidence of infection Administer acetohydroxamic acid to inhibit the chemical reaction caused by bacteria, which may help prevent struvite calculi If the patient has cystine calculi, provide instructions about diet and prescribed drugs Restrict dietary protein intake, and encourage the use of measures to alkalinize the urine Use penicillamine to reduce cystine in the urine Urinary tract infection /H18546Description Urinary tract infection is a general term used to describe infections of the upper or lower urinary tract; upper UTIs affect the kidneys, whereas lower UTIs affect the urinary bladder (cystitis) and urethra (urethritis) UTIs are the most common bacterial infections in all patients and are a signi cant source of morbid- ity; they're more common in women than in men, and they increase in frequency with age Factors that increase the risk of developing a UTI include female sex, increased sexual activity, preg- nancy, structural and functional urinary tract abnormalities (such as strictures), obstructed urine fl ow, impaired bladder innervation, urinary stasis, incomplete bladder emptying, chronic health problems that alter renal tissue structure and function, urinary tract instrumentation (such as bladder catheteriza-tion and cystoscopy), and age UTIs in men and women typically develop as an ascending infection from the urethra; other path- ways for infection\u2014such as hematogenous spread, lymphatic spread, and direct extension from other organs\u2014are rare A shorter urethra and its anatomic closeness to the vagina and rectum predispose women to ascend- ing UTIs; besides anatomic differences that help protect men against UTIs, prostatic fl uid provides an antibacterial effect Infection of the kidney by bacteria usually occurs secondary to ascending infection from the bladder; infection commonly results from ureterovesical refl ux in which an incompetent valve allows urine to fl ow back into the ureters cause most bacterial UTIs; gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria may occasionally cause pyelonephritis (an ammation of the renal pelvis, tubules, and intersti- tial tissue that can be acute or chronic and may affect one or both kidneys) Acute pyelonephritis is seldom associated with permanent renal damage Chronic pyelonephritis is commonly associated with structural abnormalities and other condi- tions (such as calculi and diabetes) that contribute to repeated infection; it's more likely than acute pyelonephritis to cause permanent kidney damage and dysfunction from repeated infl ammation and scarring /H18546Signs and symptoms Symptoms of UTIs vary; some UTIs are asymptomatic and are diagnosed when routine urine testing detects bacteriuria Cystitis commonly causes urinary frequency, urinary urgency, and dysuria (pain and burning on urination); it also may produce microscopic to gross hematuria, urinary tenesmus (persistent desire to urinate small amounts), suprapubic and bladder spasms, and cloudy, foul-smelling urine Acute pyelonephritis typically manifests with an abrupt onset of shaking chills and moderate to high fever (101.3\u00b0 to 104\u00b0 F [38.5\u00b0 to 40\u00b0 C]), tachycardia, fl ank pain, malaise, nausea, vomiting, and costover- tebral angle tenderness These signs and symptoms may be accompanied by symptoms of lower urinary tract involvement (dysuria and urinary frequency and urgency) Chills, fever, and signs of toxicity (such as falling blood pressure, tachycardia, and skin color changes) suggest deeper infection of the kidney Chronic pyelonephritis develops slowly and may progress to chronic renal failure /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis is usually based on the initial clinical presentation Urine culture may reveal at least 105 (100,000) colonies of bacteria per milliliter from a clean-catch midstream or catheterized urine specimen Urinalysis shows WBCs, casts, bacteria and, possibly, red blood cells Suprapubic needle aspiration of the bladder (if done) shows bacteria in the specimen Patients with recurrent or complicated UTIs may undergo additional diagnostic studies\u2014such rule out calculi or structural abnormalities of the urinary tract as the cause of recurrent infections Treatment of UTI and acute pyelonephritis has two goals: sterilizing the urine with antibacterial, antimicrobial, or urinary antiseptic drug therapy and identifying any illness or urinary tract abnormal-ity that may be contributing to the infection Increased urine output dilutes the urine, which relieves urethral irritation and burning; a continual urine fl ow also discourages urinary stasis and organism growth Acute UTI symptoms may be relieved temporarily with urinary analgesics (such as a phenazopyridine, anticholinergics, or antispasmodics) /H18546Nursing interventions If the patient has a lower UTI, administer antimicrobials, urinary analgesics, or antispasmodics, as prescribed; increase fl uid intake up to 3 qt (3 L) daily to help dilute the urine; and give the patient a warm sitz bath two or three times a day for 10 to 20 minutes to relieve local symptoms If the patient has pyelonephritis, administer antimicrobials, analgesics, antipyretics, and antiemetics, as prescribed, and maintain adequate fl uid intake and output Emphasize to the patient the importance of taking antimicrobial medication for the full course of therapy, even if symptoms improve Teach the patient how to prevent urinary stasis by drinking 2 to 3 qt (2 to 3 L) of fl uid daily, voiding every 2 to 3 hours, and emptying the bladder completely Stress to the patient the importance of emptying the bladder as soon as the urge to urinate occurs; delayed urination encourages UTI and urinary tract disorders Encourage women whose UTIs are related to sexual activity to empty their bladders before and after sexual intercourse Teach female patients how to reduce the number of pathogens in the perineal area by wiping from front to back after urination or defecation and cleaning the perineal and perianal area after each bowel movement Review questions 1. The nurse is providing postprocedure care for a patient who underwent extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy for the treatment of renal calculi. The nurse should instruct the patient to: /H18540A. limit oral fl uid intake for 1 to 2 weeks. /H18540B. report the presence of ne, sandlike particles in the urine. /H18540C. notify the practitioner about cloudy or foul-smelling urine. /H18540D. report bright pink urine within 24 hours after the procedure. Correct answer: C The patient should report the presence of foul-smelling or cloudy urine. Option A is incorrect because, unless contraindicated, the patient should be instructed to drink large quantities of fl uid each day to fl ush the kidneys. Option B is incorrect because sandlike debris is normal due to residual stone products. Option D is incorrect because hematuria is common after lithotripsy. 2. The nurse is planning a teaching session for a female patient who had a UTI. Which point should the nurse include? /H18540A. Limit fl uid intake to reduce the need to urinate. /H18540B. Take the prescribed antibiotic until symptoms subside. /H18540C. Notify the practitioner if urinary urgency, burning, frequency, or dif culty occurs. /H18540D. Wear only nylon underwear to reduce the chance of irritation. Correct answer: C Urinary urgency, burning, frequency, and dif culty are all common symptoms of a UTI. The patient should notify the practitioner so that a urine culture and microscopic urinalysis can be done and appropriate treatment initiated. Option A is incorrect because women should be instructed to drink 2 to 3 qt (2 to 3 L) of fl uid a day to dilute the urine and reduce irritation on the bladder mucosa. Option B is incorrect because the patient must take the full amount of antibiotics prescribed for her UTI, despite the improvement in her symptoms. Option D is incorrect because women should wear cotton underwear, not nylon, to reduce the chance of irritation. 3. The nurse is caring for a patient with acute renal failure. The nurse should expect hypertonic glucose, insulin infusions, and sodium bicarbonate a common complication of acute renal failure. It's life-threatening if immediate action isn't taken to reverse it. The administration of glucose and regular insulin infusions, with sodium bicarbonate if necessary, can temporarily prevent cardiac arrest by moving potassium into the cells and temporarily reducing serum potassium levels. Hypernatremia (Option A), hypokalemia (Option B), and hypercalcemia (Option C) don't usually occur with acute renal failure and aren't treated with glucose, insulin, or sodium bicarbonate. 274 8/2/2011 2:57:22 PM 8/2/2011 2:57:22 PMReview questions 275 4. The nurse is teaching a patient with chronic renal failure which foods to avoid. It would be most accurate for the nurse to teach the patient to avoid foods high in: /H18540A. monosaccharides. /H18540B. disaccharides. /H18540C. iron. /H18540D. protein. Correct answer: D Proteins are typically restricted in patients with chronic renal failure because of their metabolites. Carbohydrates (Options A and B) and iron (Option C) aren't restricted. 5. A patient with acute renal failure is being assessed to determine whether the cause is prerenal, renal, or postrenal. If the cause is prerenal, which condition most likely answer: A By causing inadequate renal perfusion, heart failure can lead to prerenal fail- ure. Glomerulonephritis (Option B) and aminoglycoside toxicity (Option D) are renal causes, and ureterolithiasis (Option C) is a postrenal cause. 6. When teaching a patient how to prevent the recurrence of acute glomerulonephritis, which instruction should the nurse gravity daily.\" Correct answer: C Hemolytic streptococci are common in throat infections and can cause an immune reaction that results in glomerular damage. Because of this, the patient should seek early treatment for respiratory infections. Avoiding physical activity (Option A) may promote urination, but it won't pre-vent the recurrence of glomerulonephritis. Straining all urine (Option B) helps identify renal calculi that have passed through the urine. Daily monitoring of urine speci c gravity (Option D) helps assess hydra- tion status, but it won't help prevent glomerulonephritis. 7. A patient diagnosed with chronic renal failure is told he must start hemodialysis. During patient teaching, the nurse should instruct the patient to: /H18540A. follow a high-potassium diet. /H18540B. strictly follow the hemodialysis schedule. /H18540C. recognize that the disorder will cause lifestyle changes. /H18540D. use alcohol to clean the skin because of integumentary changes. Correct answer: B To prevent life-threatening complications, the patient must strictly follow the hemo- dialysis schedule. The patient should follow a low-potassium diet-not a high-potassium diet (Option A)-because potassium levels increase in chronic renal failure. The patient should already know that hemodi-alysis is time-consuming and will cause lifestyle changes (Option C). The patient shouldn't use alcohol to clean the skin (Option D) because it would further dry out his skin.

Cover the hole with tape. /H18540B. Remove the catheter and collection bag, replace the bag, and insert a new catheter, using sterile technique. /H18540C. Disconnect the drainage bag from the catheter and replace it with a new bag. /H18540D. Place a towel under the bag to prevent spillage of urine on the fl oor, which could cause the patient to slip and fall. Correct answer: B Because the system is no longer closed, bacteria may have been introduced into the system, requiring insertion of a new sterile catheter and drainage bag. Covering the hole with tape (Option A) or placing a towel under the bag (Option D) leaves the system open, increasing the risk of infection. Disconnecting the drainage bag and replacing it with a new bag (Option C) opens up the entire system to infection. 9. During a health history, which statement by a patient indicates a risk of renal calculi? /H18540A. \"I've been drinking a lot of cola and soft drinks lately.\" /H18540B. \"I've been jogging more than usual.\" /H18540C. \"I've had more stress since we adopted a child last year.\" /H18540D. \"I'm a vegetarian and eat cheese two or three times each day.\" Correct answer: D Renal calculi typically consist of calcium, and diets high in calcium-found in cheese and other milk products-may predispose a person to renal calculi. Cola and soft drinks (Option A) don't contain ingredients that would increase the risk of renal calculi. Jogging (Option B) and increased stress (Option C) aren't considered risk factors for renal calculi formation. 10. Diuretics are ordered for a patient. What would be the best time of day for the nurse to schedule this medication? /H18540A. Anytime /H18540B. Nighttime /H18540C. Morning /H18540D. Noon Correct answer: C Giving a diuretic in the morning allows it to work throughout the day. Giving a diuretic anytime (Option A) or at noon (Option D) wouldn't provide this advantage. Giving a diuretic at nighttime (Option B) would cause the patient to get up frequently to go to the bathroom, interrupting sleep. Med-Surg_Chap15.indd 276 Med-Surg_Chap15.indd 276 8/2/2011 2:57:22 PM 8/2/2011 2:57:22 PM16 277 Introduction /H18546The chief function of the reproductive system is procreation and the manufacture of sex hormones /H18546Alterations in the reproductive system affect the ability to procreate and alter human social and emo- tional health /H18546Nursing history The nurse asks the patient about the chief complaint The female with a reproductive disorder may be experiencing pain, vaginal discharge, abnormal uterine bleeding, pruritus, or infertility The male with a reproductive disorder may be experiencing penile discharge, impotence, infertil- ity, or scrotal or inguinal masses, pain, or tenderness The nurse then questions the patient about the present illness Ask the patient about his symptoms, including when they started, associated symptoms, location, radiation, intensity, duration, frequency, and precipitating and alleviating factors Ask about the use of prescription and over-the-counter drugs; herbal remedies; vitamin and nutri- tional supplements, including oral contraceptives and hormones; and use of any alternative therapies The nurse asks about the medical history Question the female patient about her reproductive history, endocrine disorders, human immuno- de ciency virus (HIV) status, infection or cancer of the reproductive organs, and sexually transmitted disease (STD) Question the male patient about his medical history, including diabetes, hypertension, mumps, HIV status, STD, endocrine disorders, and infection or cancer of the reproductive organs The nurse then assesses the family history Ask about a family history of diabetes and hypertension Also question the patient about a family history of cancer of the reproductive organs, diethylstil- bestrol exposure, and other reproductive disorders The nurse obtains a social history Ask about work, exercise, diet, use of recreational drugs and alcohol, and hobbies Also ask about stress, support systems, and coping mechanisms Then, question the patient about the use of birth control, safe sex practices, sexual preference, number of sexual partners, and satisfaction /H18546Physical assessment The nurse begins with inspection Observe the patient's general appearance, noting behaviors and mental status Inspect the external genitalia and pubic hair, noting any swelling, lumps, discharge, rashes, lesions, lice, or odors Observe the size and shape of the breasts, noting any nipple discharge Inspect the female patient's internal genitalia using a speculum Assess the male patient for inguinal and femoral hernias during Valsalva's maneuver and while coughing Next, the nurse uses palpation Palpate the external genitalia, noting any areas of swelling, tenderness, or hardness Palpate the breasts for lumps and nipple dischargeReproductive system disordersReproductive system disorders Palpate the male patient's scrotal sac, noting the size and shape of the testicles and the presence of masses or tenderness If the patient is a male, palpate the inguinal area, and check for hernias prostatic hyperplasia is prostate gland enlargement; about 50% of men older than age 50 and 75% of men older than age 70 have symptoms of such enlargement The cause is unknown but may be linked to hormonal changes As the prostate enlarges, the urethral opening narrows and obstructs or interferes with urine fl ow, causing urine retention or incomplete emptying; eventually, the ureters and kidneys dilate, and urinary tract infections (UTIs) result from urinary stasis Progressive bladder distention may cause a pouch to form in the bladder that retains urine when the rest of the bladder empties /H18546Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms urine retention Hematuria, bladder calculi, impaired renal function, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and abdom- inal discomfort also may occur /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Digital rectal examination can detect the enlarged lateral lobes of the prostate; cystoscopy, urethrog- raphy, excretory studies may be performed; prostate-speci c antigen (PSA) can help to rule out prostatic carcinoma; and postvoid residual urine test and transrectal ultrasonography may also be performed Conservative treatment may include nasteride (Proscar) to decrease the size of the prostate muscles and promote urination For acute cases, a urologist may insert a urinary catheter; a stylet may be needed to pass through the obstruction, or a suprapubic cystostomy (incision and catheter placement in the bladder through the abdomen wall) may be needed When a urinary obstruction is present, prostatectomy (surgical removal of soft tissue from the pros- tate) by one of four techniques is commonly performed (see Types of prostatectomies ) Newer treatments include balloon urethroplasty, laser therapy, and intraurethral stents Other minimally invasive surgical techniques include: Transurethral needle ablation to burn away well-de ned regions of the prostate, thereby improv- ing urine fl ow with less risk Transurethral microwave treatment to destroy portions of the prostate with heat /H18546Preoperative nursing interventions Explain the surgical procedure, perioperative experience, and expected postoperative course to help decrease the patient's anxiety Allow the patient to discuss fears and concerns about postoperative urinary incontinence and impotence, but assure him that they aren't common after prostate surgery, only after radical perineal resection /H18546Postoperative nursing interventions Evaluate the patient's pain and response to analgesia Explain to the patient that after transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), bladder spasms are typical; explain to him that the sensation of needing to void is normal and that avoiding straining may decrease the frequency and intensity of bladder spasms Observe and maintain the patency of the three-way irrigation system; clots can obstruct the system and cause pain and bladder spasms; if clots form, increase the fl ow of saline solution to dilute the urine and the clots fl at the incision site, penile infl ammation at the catheter site, and pain in the fl ank area caused by UTI Administer opioids for pain as prescribed; belladonna and opium suppositories may be prescribed for bladder spasms Monitor the patient for potential complications Watch for hemorrhage and shock, which can occur postoperatively because the prostate is a highly vascular gland Check urinary drainage, which initially should be reddish pink with a few small clots and then lighter pink during the rst 24 hours after surgery; bright red drainage with clots indicates arterial bleeding and typically requires surgical intervention Check for hemodynamic alterations (such as tachycardia, increased respiratory rate, and decreased blood pressure) and other signs of hemorrhage, including restlessness, pallor, and cold, clammy skin Monitor the patient's fl uid and electrolyte status Make sure that the catheter drains well; catheter obstruction by clots can cause prostatic capsule or bladder distention and hemorrhage Assess the patient for bladder distention by palpating for a rounded swelling above the pubis Using aseptic technique, perform manual irrigation when needed with 50 mL of sterile normal saline solution to remove clots Carefully record the intake of irrigating solution and the output of urine and irrigating solutionTransurethral resection of the prostate Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is the most common surgical procedure for treating BPH. The urolo-gist passes an endoscopic instrument directly through the urethra to visualize the prostate without making an incision. Then the urologist removes the medial lobe of the gland in small pieces, leaving behind the prostatic capsule. After removing the prostate tissue, the urologist inserts a large, three-way indwelling urinary catheter with a 30-ml balloon to continuously irrigate the bladder and keep it free from clots. Traction may be placed briefl y on the catheter to fa- cilitate hemostasis at the operative site. However, prolonged traction can cause tissue necrosis. The traction and balloon pressure cause transient post- operative bladder spasms and a continual urge to void. Post-operative complications include hemorrhage, clot retention, bladder perforation during surgery, catheter displacement, urinary tract infection, and water intoxication related to con-tinuous bladder irrigation. Suprapubic prostatectomy Suprapubic prostatectomy is performed when a large mass of tissue must be removed. After making an abdominal inci-sion, the urologist removes the prostate through the blad-der. Then a suprapubic catheter, indwelling urinary catheter, and sometimes a surgical drain are put in place, and the bladder is irrigated continuously for the rst 24 hours after surgery to remove clots. The suprapubic catheter is removed 3 to 4 days after surgery; the indwelling urinary catheter re-mains in place until the suprapubic catheter site heals. Suprapubic prostatectomy can produce the same complications as TURP as well as complications related to abdominal surgery. Perineal prostatectomy Perineal prostatectomy, which is commonly performed while treating prostate cancer, removes prostate tissue through an incision made between the rectum and the scrotum. If cancer is con rmed, adjacent tissue also may be removed in a procedure called radical perineal resection. An indwelling urinary catheter and sometimes a surgical drain are put in place. The chief postoperative complication is wound infection because of the incision's location. Urinary incontinence and impotence resection. prostatectomy Retropubic prostatectomy takes an abdominal approach excising a large prostate gland high in the pelvis. The bladder is retracted, and the prostate is removed through an incision in the prostatic capsule. An indwelling urinary catheter is put in place. Postoperative complications are the same as for supra- pubic prostatectomy.Types of prostatectomies Four types of prostatectomy to treat prostatic PM280 Reproductive system disorders Observe the patient for signs of cerebral edema, such as confusion and agitation; water intoxication can result when the irrigating solution is absorbed into the vascular system during surgery Check for and take precautions to prevent wound infection, UTI, and epididymitis Use aseptic technique when performing catheter care and changing dressings and irrigation solution containers Avoid taking rectal temperatures and administering enemas to prevent trauma to the operative area Monitor the patient for signs of infection, such as fever, redness, swelling, and drainage from the incision site Change wet dressings frequently to prevent skin maceration After a suprapubic, perineal, or retropubic prostatectomy, monitor the patient for and take steps to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism Monitor the patient for postoperative respiratory complications Assess urinary continence after the catheter is removed Monitor urine output, and observe the patient for urine retention Explain that incontinence is normal after prostate surgery, that it's transient and will gradually improve, except after radical perineal surgery Encourage perineal exercises and voluntary interruption of the urine stream to expedite the return of bladder control Prepare the patient for discharge Encourage the patient to discuss his feelings about sexual activity Discuss with the surgeon when the patient can resume sexual activity (usually within 3 to 8 weeks) Advise the patient about retrograde ejaculation to the bladder (urine may appear milky) Refer a patient who has had a radical prostatectomy for counseling because physiologic impo- tence may occur Tell the patient to avoid prolonged sitting, vigorous exercise, heavy lifting, and straining to decrease pressure on the operative area and help prevent bleeding Discuss ways to avoid constipation; provide dietary suggestions to promote soft stools and enhance wound healing Advise the patient to drink 2\u00bd qt (2.5 L) of fl uid daily to keep stools soft and prevent urinary stasis and UTI (unless contraindicated); discourage the intake of caffeine-containing beverages, which can irritate the urinary system; and encourage decreased fl uid intake in the evening to minimize nocturia Alert a patient who has undergone TURP about the possibility of secondary hemorrhage 2 weeks after the operation Instruct the patient to call the surgeon immediately if bleeding, decreased urinary stream, or signs of infection develop Breast cancer /H18546Description Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and the second leading cause of cancer deaths in women; it affects one of eight women in the United States, and its incidence increases with age; 1% of all breast cancer occurs in men The cause of breast cancer is unknown, but risk factors include a family history of breast cancer, inherited gene factors BRCA1 and BRCA2, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, exposure to ionizing radia-tion or chemical carcinogens, nulliparity or low parity, lack of breast-feeding, use of estrogen replace-ment therapy for menopausal symptoms, a high-fat diet, and the onset of menarche before age 12, menopause after age 55, and rst pregnancy after age 30 The lifetime risk of breast cancer for women with BRCA1 mutation is 50% to 85%, compared with a risk of 11% for women without this gene mutation The prognosis depends on the type of cancer and the stage of the disease at the time of treatment; early detection and treatment result in a more favorable prognosis Med-Surg_Chap16.indd 280 Med-Surg_Chap16.indd 280 8/2/2011 3:01:36 PM 8/2/2011 3:01:36 PMBreast cancer 281 Breast cancer commonly begins as atypical cells, progresses to ductal or lobular carcinoma in situ, and then enters an invasive stage; in the invasive stage, the cancer can spread quickly to regional lymph nodes and the systemic circulation Common metastatic sites include the lungs, bone, liver, brain, pelvis, and abdomen /H18546Signs and symptoms A small, nontender, palpable, movable mass in the breast is an early sign of breast cancer, although it may go undetected until later signs develop; the common site for such a mass is the upper outer quad-rant of the breast Late signs of breast cancer include skin dimpling or puckering, skin color changes over the lesion, nipple retraction, breast contour changes, serous or bloody nipple discharge, palpable axillary or other lymph nodes, breast asymmetry, erythema, ridging, and a prominent venous pattern Infl ammatory carcinoma is a rare form of breast cancer that produces a tender, enlarged, reddened, hot breast; in advanced cases, the breast may become ulcerated, infected, and necrotic /H18546Diagnosis and treatment About 90% of breast cancers are discovered by breast self-examination (BSE); BSE and annual breast examination by a health care professional may detect early disease; however, micrometastases may have disseminated by the time the tumor is palpable The American Cancer Society guidelines state that women over age 40 should have a mammogram annually and a clinical examination at least annually and all women should perform breast self- examination monthly Mammography can detect early lesions before they're palpable; xeroradiography, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography also may be used The diagnosis of breast cancer is made by ne-needle aspiration and excisional biopsy of the tumor; the biopsied tissue is analyzed to determine whether the tumor is hormone-dependent, a factor that infl uences treatment Newer biopsy techniques include mammotone biopsy, biopsy, and advanced breast biopsy instrument Ductal lavage may also be performed to detect malignant cells Sentinel lymph node mapping, in which a radioactive substance or blue dye is injected around the biopsy site, may be performed before surgery; the sentinel node (the one most likely to contain malig-nant cells) is the one that contains the most radioactivity and blue dye, which then will be biopsied Treatment depends on the tumor's histopathology and aggressiveness, hormonal factors (the patient's menopausal status and the tumor's hormone dependency), extent of disease, and the patient's overall health and treatment preferences Surgery is the primary treatment for breast cancer; breast reconstruction surgery may be performed immediately after surgery or later (see Types of breast surgery ); laser ablation is an alternative to lumpec- tomy in women with tumors that are smaller than \u00be (2 cm) Lumpectomy or tumorectomy (simple excision of the tumor along with a margin of normal tissue) is used to treat early disease. Quadrantectomy (resection of the involved breast quad- rant and dissection of axillary lymph nodes) also may be used to treat early disease. Simple mastectomy (removal of the main breast struc- ture) may be performed for early disease or palliation in advanced, ulcerative disease. It doesn't remove the overlying skin, axillary nodes, and underlying muscles. Modi ed radical mastectomy (removal of the entire breast, some overlying skin and adjacent soft tissue, axillary lymph nodes, and the pectoralis major muscle) is the most common surgery for early disease. Radical mastectomy (removal of the entire breast, both pectoral muscles, and axillary nodes) is rarely used since the advent of less dis guring procedures.Types of breast surgery Several surgical options are available for a patient with breast cancer. Med-Surg_Chap16.indd 281 Med-Surg_Chap16.indd 281 8/2/2011 3:01:36 PM 8/2/2011 3:01:36 PM282 Reproductive system disorders Radiation therapy is the primary treatment for patients who can't tolerate anesthesia or surgery or who have infl ammatory carcinoma Primary radiation therapy with \"boost\" to the tumor site (application of additional radiation by external beam or placement of iridium needles in the former tumor site) may be used in early stages of breast cancer as a supplement to surgery and primary radiation Radiation therapy to the breast and lymph nodes followed by \"boost\" to the tumor site is used after breast-preserving surgery (such as lumpectomy, quadrantectomy, and simple mastectomy) Adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended after primary treatment and typically involves a com- (Gemzar) Hormone therapy or indicated for patients with hormone-dependent breast cancer; anties- trogen drugs such as tamoxifen may be prescribed, and adrenalectomy, oophorectomy, or hypophysec-tomy may be considered Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab may be used to treat metastatic breast cancer in women who have an excess amount of breast cancer cell antigen HER2 Bone marrow or blood stem cell transplantation may be used to restore stem cells /H18546Nursing interventions for a patient with early breast cancer Assess the patient's and family's understanding of the disease, diagnostic tests, and treatments, and intervene accordingly Encourage the patient to discuss her fears and concerns about the disease, diagnostic tests, treat- ments, and sexuality; clarify misconceptions, and be aware that breast cancer treatment can change the patient's body image and self-concept Evaluate the patient's support systems, and refer her to clergy members, home health care services, hospices, or support groups (such as Reach to Recovery, a group of volunteers who provide emotional and educational support during the preoperative and postoperative periods) /H18546Nursing interventions for a patient undergoing mastectomy Monitor the patient for complications of general anesthesia and surgery, such as hemorrhage, wound infection, and altered respiratory status During the initial postoperative period, frequently check the dressing and Hemovac drains for excessive bleeding Check the patency of the Hemovac drains, and empty drains when half full to maintain suction and prevent fl uid accumulation; drains are typically removed after 3 to 5 days Use strict aseptic technique for dressing changes Encourage the patient to perform deep-breathing and coughing exercises; administer analgesics to prevent respiratory splinting Evaluate the patient's nutritional status, and promote adequate nutritional intake to foster wound healing Evaluate the patient's level of pain and response to analgesia and comfort measures Promote comfort by elevating the head of the bed and positioning the patient on the unaffected side supported by pillows (lying on the affected side can cause severe pain) Position the affected arm on pillows to provide support and enhance circulation Encourage the patient to use her unaffected arm to help change position or get out of bed Monitor the patient for lymphedema, and take steps to prevent it Never perform blood pressure readings, venipuncture, or injections on the affected arm Check for edema in the affected arm; diuretics may be prescribed in the acute phase, and an elastic sleeve may be used during the chronic phase Elevate, massage, and exercise the affected arm to improve circulation and prevent edema; teach the patient to do this at home Teach the patient other techniques for preventing lymphedema, such as avoiding sun exposure, applying cream several times a day, using a thimble while sewing, using gloves while cleaning or Med-Surg_Chap16.indd 282 Med-Surg_Chap16.indd 282 8/2/2011 3:01:36 PM 283 gardening, wearing medical identi cation at all times, avoiding restrictive jewelry and clothing, not carrying heavy objects with the affected arm, and elevating the arm above the right atrium to promote circulatory and lymphatic fl ow Teach the patient arm exercises to prevent muscle shortening, stiffening, and contracture and to pre- serve muscle tone Encourage early and frequent ambulation; help the patient from her unaffected side, and help her maintain posture Provide rest periods between activities to avoid tiring the patient Prepare the patient for discharge by providing verbal and written instructions about pain medica- tions, activity restrictions, arm exercises, lymphedema prevention, follow-up treatments, referrals to postdischarge support services, and information about prostheses; also provide an opportunity to dis-cuss the effect of surgery on sexuality /H18546Nursing interventions for a patient receiving chemotherapy after a mastectomy Monitor for and teach the patient about the adverse effects and toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents (see Nursing implications in oncology care , page 357) Follow guidelines for handling chemotherapeutic agents to prevent personal risks associated with repeated exposure to these drugs Monitor the patient for adverse effects of hormone therapy such as fl uid retention /H18546Nursing interventions for a patient receiving breast-preserving surgery and radiation therapy Follow postoperative nursing interventions for a patient undergoing mastectomy Monitor the patient for complications of radiation therapy, such as nausea, dyspepsia, esophagitis, transient pneumonitis, cough, fatigue, depression, and altered skin integrity at the surgical site and iridium needle site Provide emotional support to the patient and family during \"boost\" therapy with an internal inter- stitial implant because radiation precautions require a private room and restricted visitation while the implant is in place (about 2 days) because of gamma ray emissions /H18546Nursing interventions for a patient with advanced breast cancer Develop an individualized plan of care based on the patient's treatment: radiation therapy, chemo- therapy, hormone therapy, oophorectomy, adrenalectomy, or hypophysectomy Evaluate the patient's pain and response to pain-control and comfort measures; inform the practitio- ner and other health care team members if pain-control measures are ineffective Promote comfort by positioning the patient, applying heat or cold, using massage, providing pillows and a rm mattress, and teaching the patient relaxation techniques and guided imagery Promote adequate nutritional intake, particularly protein Collaborate with the dietitian to improve nutrition; assess the need for supplements Administer antiemetics as prescribed, and provide meticulous oral hygiene to improve the patient's ability and desire to eat Prevent alterations in skin integrity Observe the patient's skin and mucous membranes for signs of impaired skin integrity; radiation therapy, chemotherapy, inadequate nutrition, and impaired mobility can lead to skin breakdown and mucous membrane irritation Provide oral and skin care; applying lip gloss or petroleum jelly to the lips may be helpful Promote activity and position changes to prevent prolonged pressure and tissue necrosis Ensure adequate nutrition Cervical cancer /H18546Description Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers of the female reproductive system; it's most com- mon in women between ages 30 and 50 and among Black, Hispanic, and Native American women The most important risk factor for cervical cancer is infection with human papillomavirus (HPV); 90% of all cervical cancers are attributed to certain HPV types Med-Surg_Chap16.indd 283 Med-Surg_Chap16.indd 283 8/2/2011 3:01:36 PM 8/2/2011 3:01:36 PM284 Reproductive system disorders Risk factors include rst intercourse at a young age, multiple male sex partners, long-term cigarette smoking, a weakened immune system, HIV infection, use of oral contraceptives for longer than 5 years, and having given birth to three or more children About 95% of cervical cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, which affect the epidermal layer of the cervix; the precursor of this type of carcinoma is called dysplasia or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia About 5% of cervical cancers are adenocarcinomas, which arise from the mucus-producing gland cells of the cervix; these cancers have no precursor Cervical cancer is categorized according to the extent of the primary tumor, lymph node involve- ment, and metastasis The prognosis depends on the stage of the disease and the treatment required; cure rates are as high as 100% in the early stages /H18546Signs and symptoms Early stages of cervical cancer are asymptomatic Later stages may cause vaginal discharge (leukorrhea) that gradually increases in amount and changes from watery to dark and foul-smelling; irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting between men-strual periods or after menopause may occur; spotting or bleeding may occur after intercourse, douch-ing, or bowel movements Advanced invasive disease is associated with chronic infections, ulcers, pelvic pressure or pain, or abscesses at the tumor site; severe back and leg pain; anorexia; and anemia /H18546Diagnosis and treatment The Papanicolaou (Pap) test is used to screen for cervical cancer If cervical neoplasia or cancer is detected on a Pap test, then colposcopy, punch biopsy, or computed tomography (CT), and MRI also may be performed The treatment of cervical cancer depends on the patient's health and age and the presence of other complications Dysplasia and noninvasive cervical cancer (carcinoma in situ) may be removed by cryotherapy, car- bon dioxide laser therapy, or conization (removal of a cone-shaped section of the cervix); these proce-dures maintain fertility but require frequent follow-up to detect recurrence Noninvasive cervical cancer may be treated with a simple hysterectomy (removal of the cervix and uterus) in women who don't want future pregnancies Invasive cervical cancer may be treated by radiation therapy, radical surgery, or chemotherapy (see Treatments for invasive cervical cancer ) /H18546Nursing interventions for a patient with early cervical cancer Assess the patient's and family's understanding of the disease, diagnostic tests, and treatments, and intervene accordingly Allow the patient to discuss her fears and concerns about the disease, diagnostic tests, treatments, and sexuality; clarify misconceptions and be aware that cervical cancer can change the patient's body image and self-concept Evaluate the patient's support systems, and refer her to clergy members, home health care services, hospices, or support groups as needed /H18546Nursing interventions for a patient undergoing cryotherapy, carbon dioxide laser therapy, or cervical conization During the immediate postoperative period, monitor the patient for complications of anesthesia\u2014 typically a local anesthesia\u2014and hemorrhage Before discharge, provide verbal and written instructions about activity restrictions, and tell the patient to avoid using tampons and douching and to watch for and report increased vaginal bleeding or discharge and fever /H18546Nursing interventions for a patient undergoing hysterectomy Administer an enema and a douche preoperatively as prescribed Monitor the patient for complications after general anesthesia and major abdominal surgery\u2014and take steps to prevent them 284 Med-Surg_Chap16.indd 284 8/2/2011 3:01:36 PM 8/2/2011 3:01:36 PMCervical cancer 285 Monitor the patient for hemorrhage by assessing vital signs, wound drainage, and vaginal drain- age; she may have surgical drains connected to a Hemovac Initiate leg exercises and early ambulation to prevent venous stasis and thrombophlebitis Monitor bowel sounds and encourage early ambulation to expedite the return of bowel function; a nasogastric tube may be in place for the rst 24 hours after surgery Observe the patient for altered urinary elimination; because the surgery is performed near the bladder, it can cause nerve damage and trauma to the ureter and bladder Assess the patient's pain and response to analgesia If possible, administer analgesics using patient-controlled analgesia Ensure adequate pain relief, which encourages the patient to perform leg exercises, deep-breathing and coughing exercises, and early ambulation Provide written and oral discharge instructions, and instruct the patient to take showers instead of baths to prevent vaginal infl ammation and infection; explain activity restrictions; encourage her to avoid sitting for prolonged periods, lifting and straining until the rst postoperative checkup, and intercourse for 4 to 6 weeks; instruct her to notify the practitioner if vaginal discharge, bleeding, or fever develop; and teach her about the therapeutic and adverse effects and dosing schedule of pre-scribed medications /H18546Nursing interventions for a patient undergoing radiation therapy Assess the patient's comfort level and response to analgesia; administer opioids at regularly sched- uled intervals Position the patient for comfort, using pillows for support; strict bed rest in the supine position is maintained while the implant is in place Advise the patient that cell destruction by radiation causes foul-smelling vaginal discharge; mini- mize these effects with meticulous perineal care, a room deodorizer, and reassurance that the dis-charge is a temporary result of treatment Monitor the patient for local and systemic complications of radiation therapyRadiation therapy Radiation therapy, which uses whole pelvic irradiation and intracavitary implants, causes ovarian function to cease. Before treatment, the patient follows a low-residue diet, receives enemas, and has an indwelling urinary catheter in-serted to prevent bowel and bladder distention. These pro-cedures allow more room for the implant and may protect the bowel and bladder from radiation. Complications of ra-diation therapy include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malaise, fever, hemorrhage, cystitis, phlebitis, vesicovaginal stulas, and removes the uterus and proximal vagina through an abdominal incision. Pelvic lymph node dissection may be performed for stage I and early stage II disease; a salpingo-oophorectomy also may be performed. Surgical drains are placed below the incision site to drain excess fluid. An indwelling urinary catheter is placed preoperatively to prevent bladder trauma during surgery and to allow for postoperative urine drainage. (In the immediate postoperative period, the bladder may be atonic.) Pelvic exenteration is used for advanced or recurrent cervical cancer con ned to the pelvis. Total exenteration removes the bladder, rectosigmoid, and all reproductive organs and nodes. The bladder and sigmoid may be pre-served if disease isn't evident in these structures. For either type of surgery, complications include abdom- inal distention, paralytic ileus, thrombophlebitis, wound infection, atelectasis, and other complications of general anesthesia and major abdominal surgery. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy commonly includes fl uorouracil, ifosfamide, and cisplatin alone or in combination to treat metastatic or nonresectable disease.Treatments for invasive cervical cancer Radiation therapy, radical surgery, or chemotherapy may be used to treat invasive cervical cancer.

provide emotional support to a patient who feels isolated because of restricted visitation Prepare the patient for discharge by providing verbal and written instructions about medications, wound care, activity restrictions (including sexual activity), and follow-up appointments; also advise her that she must douche twice daily as prescribed, that vaginal drainage and bleeding should dimin-ish gradually over 1 to 3 months, and that she should contact the practitioner if fever, increased pain, increased drainage, or altered urinary or bowel elimination occurs /H18546Nursing interventions for a patient undergoing pelvic exenteration Implement the same preoperative and postoperative nursing interventions as for a patient undergo- ing hysterectomy Be sensitive to the fact that this procedure exacts a tremendous physical, psychosocial, and emotional toll on the patient and requires a multidisciplinary approach to patient care, involving an enterostomal therapist, a social worker, and a dietitian Refer the patient for support to help her cope with the resulting changes in lifestyle, body image, and sexuality /H18546Nursing interventions for a patient whose ovaries have been removed or undergoing radiation therapy A premenopausal woman whose ovaries have been removed or irradiated will experience menopause Discuss the physiologic changes of menopause and self-care practices to promote optimal health and a feeling of well-being; recommend regular exercise, calcium and vitamin E and B-complex supple-ments, a calcium-rich diet, vaginal lubricants, and hormone therapy (controversial) to relieve various menopausal symptoms Endometrial cancer /H18546Description Endometrial cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed gynecologic cancers Risk factors include early menarche, late menopause, infertility, extended use of tamoxifen or unop- posed estrogens, obesity, diabetes, advancing age, high-fat diet, history of breast and ovarian cancers, previous pelvic radiation, and family history Most endometrial cancers are adenocarcinomas and are slow to grow and metastasize; common sites for metastasis are the lungs, liver, and bone /H18546Signs and symptoms The woman may report abnormal vaginal bleeding, especially after menopause Dif cult or painful urination, pain during intercourse, and pelvic pain may also occur In advanced cases, lymph node enlargement, pleural effusion, abdominal masses, or ascites may be present /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis is based on a physical examination and history Other diagnostic tools include transvaginal ultrasound, endometrial biopsy, CA-125 blood test, CT scan, MRI, cystoscopy, proctoscopy, and Pap test The primary treatment for endometrial cancer is hysterectomy; a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy may also be performed Progesterone therapy may be indicated for patients with recurrent disease Women with metastatic disease may receive combination chemotherapy that may include doxorubi- cin, cisplatin, paclitaxel, etoposide, and dactinomycin Radiation therapy may be indicated before, after, or instead of surgery in some women; radioactive implants may be used /H18546Nursing interventions Assess the patient's and family's understanding of the disease, diagnostic tests, and treatments, and intervene accordingly Med-Surg_Chap16.indd 286 Med-Surg_Chap16.indd 286 8/2/2011 3:01:36 PM 8/2/2011 3:01:36 PMEndometriosis 287 Provide analgesics and comfort measures as needed Encourage the patient to discuss her feelings regarding self-esteem and body image disturbance /H18546Nursing interventions for a patient undergoing other treatments Provide care related to abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic radiation therapy (see Cervical cancer , page 283) Provide care related to systemic chemotherapy (see Nursing implications in oncology care , page 357) Endometriosis /H18546Description Endometriosis is a benign condition in which the endometrial cells that normally line the uterus are dispersed throughout the pelvis; the most common ectopic tissue sites are the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterosacral ligaments, cul-de-sac of Douglas, pelvic peritoneum, rectovaginal septum, and cervix The misplaced endometrial cells respond to normal ovarian hormone stimulation; during menstrua- tion, the ectopic endometrial tissue grows, becomes secretory, and bleeds, which causes pressure and infl ammation at the involved site and creates brosis, adhesions, and cysts Endometriosis may result from the transfer endometrial cells by blood from autoimmune or congenital factors Risk factors for endometriosis include family history, delayed childbearing, retrofl exed uterus, use of an intrauterine device (IUD), polymenorrhea, hypermenorrhea, menstrual periods that last longer than 5 days, spotting, and being of Asian descent Endometriosis can occur in any woman of childbearing age but usually begins between ages 30 and 40; it's responsible for 30% to 45% of female infertility /H18546Signs and symptoms The chief symptom of endometriosis is painful menstruation (dysmenorrhea) or menstrual cramps Many women with advanced disease are asymptomatic; the disease is discovered when they undergo testing related to infertility Other symptoms of endometriosis include dyspareunia, painful defecation, rectal pressure, and abnormal uterine bleeding (menstrual cycles of less than 27 days; menses that last longer than 7 days) The pelvic examination may reveal bluish lesions on the labia, perineal area, cervix, or vaginal wall; tender nodules in the posterior vaginal fornix of the vagina, along the uterosacral ligaments, and along the cul-de-sac; adnexal thickening and nodules; tender, enlarged, and xed ovaries; and a xed, retro- verted uterus that's painful when moved /H18546Diagnosis and treatment The diagnosis of endometriosis is determined by patient history and physical examination; biopsy\u2014 using laparoscopy\u2014of the endometrial tissue is required to con rm the diagnosis Vaginal ultrasonography, complete blood count, cultures and blood tests for STDs, Pap test, urinalysis, and a pregnancy test may be performed Treatment of endometriosis depends on the patient's age, symptoms, stage of disease, and desire to have children Drugs may be used to treat endometriosis (see Drug therapy for endometriosis, page 288) Laparoscopy, under general anesthesia, may be used to diagnose and treat endometriosis; after inserting a scope into the peritoneal cavity through a small abdominal incision, the surgeon insuf-fl ates carbon dioxide into the abdominal cavity to separate the intestines from the pelvic organs and to improve visualization; after determining the extent of the disease, the surgeon uses fulguration or laser surgery to treat lesions and adhesions Women with severe, symptomatic, painful endometriosis may decide to undergo bilateral salpingo- oophorectomy and total abdominal hysterectomy; laser surgery may also be used In some women, endometriosis may disappear without treatment; in others, pregnancy causes remis- sion of the disease /H18546Nursing interventions Teach the patient about reproductive anatomy and physiology, the disease, and the medications used to treat it Med-Surg_Chap16.indd 287 Med-Surg_Chap16.indd 287 8/2/2011 3:01:36 PM 8/2/2011 3:01:36 PM288 Reproductive system disorders Teach the patient about activities that may promote comfort and help relieve symptoms: regular exercise, sexual excitement and orgasm, increased intake of natural diuretics (such as watermelons, cranberry juice, peaches, and asparagus), decreased intake of salt and high-sodium foods, increased intake of iron-rich foods, application of heat to the pelvic area and lower back, relaxation techniques, and guided imagery Allow the patient to discuss feelings about how the disease affects her lifestyle, body image, and self- concept Provide additional emotional support to a patient who is infertile; also refer the patient for infertility testing and counseling Provide postoperative care for a patient undergoing laparoscopy; monitor her for complications of general anesthesia and hemorrhage, and provide verbal and written discharge instructions to ensure that she understands self-care measures and follow-up treatment Teach the patient and family about wound care Advise the patient to expect several days of gaslike pain in the abdomen and referred shoulder pain from carbon dioxide insuffl ation; recommend analgesics, local heat application, and a light diet to enhance comfort Inform the patient about pain medications, activity restrictions (including sexual activity), and follow-up treatment Provide postoperative care for a patient undergoing hysterectomy, oophorectomy, or bilateral salpin- gectomy; this care is the same as that for a patient with cervical cancer who undergoes these procedures (see Cervical cancer , page 283) Erectile dysfunction /H18546Description Erectile dysfunction is the inability to attain or maintain penile erection long enough to complete intercourse The disorder is classi ed as primary or secondary In primary impotence , the patient never achieves suf cient erection In secondary impotence , the patient has achieved erection and completed intercourse in the past Analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-infl ammatory drugs, and diuretics are prescribed to relieve pain, infl ammation, and fl uid retention. Oral contraceptives interrupt ovulation and produce endometrial atrophy, thereby decreasing endometrial fl ow in the peritoneal cavity. Their adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, weight gain, depression, fatigue, breast tender-ness, and recurrent vaginitis. Danazol, a synthetic androgen, may be prescribed for 6 months to suppress ovarian activity and cause ectopic endometrial atrophy. The most effective drug for endometri-osis, danazol relieves pain in about 90% of patients. Because endometriosis recurs in 5% to 20% of patients, repeated 6-month courses of therapy may be needed. Adverse effects include acne, decreased breast size, voice deepening, depression, hirsutism, hot fl ashes, oily skin, vaginal dryness, and weight gain. Nasally administered nafarelin, a gonadotropin- releasing hormone (GnRH) control ectopic activity. Nafarelin causes fewer adverse effects than danazol; nafarelin's adverse effects may include depression, hot fl ashes, insomnia, and vaginal dryness. Medroxyprogesterone, a progestin, reduces dysmenor- rhea and pelvic pain. Adverse effects include breakthrough bleeding, emotional lability, blood clots, myocardial infarc-tion, pulmonary embolism, nausea, (Lupron) and goserelin (Zoladex), GnRH agonists, block the production and release of luteiniz ing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, thereby reduc-ing estrogen production and leading to decreased pelvic pain and shrinking of endometrial implants. Treatment is limited to 6 months because long-term use can cause bone loss. Common adverse effects may mimic symptoms of menopause, including hot fl ashes, vaginal dryness, decreased libido, headache, and mood swings.Drug therapy for endometriosis Various types of drugs are prescribed to manage endometriosis. Med-Surg_Chap16.indd 288 Med-Surg_Chap16.indd 288 8/2/2011 3:01:36 289 In most cases, erectile dysfunction has an organic cause, such as vascular insuf ciency or veno- occlusive dysfunction Other causes include certain medications, such as antihypertensives and diuretics, and alcohol and drug abuse Some cases may be psychogenic All age groups may be affected, although the incidence increases with age /H18546Signs and symptoms Onset may occur suddenly, or the patient may experience a gradual decline in sexual function A history of medical disorders, drug therapy, or psychological trauma may accompany the disorder /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Laboratory ndings may include a decrease in serum testosterone levels Glycosylated hemoglobin level may be elevated, indicating uncontrolled diabetes mellitus Urinalysis results may be abnormal, indicating kidney damage or diabetes mellitus Lipid pro les may be increased, indicating atherosclerosis Blood glucose levels may be increased, a sign of diabetes mellitus Serum creatinine levels may be elevated, resulting from kidney damage PSA results help rule out prostate cancer Ultrasonography evaluates vascular function; angiography evaluates vaso-occlusive disease Direct injection of alprostadil corpora evaluates the quality of erection Nocturnal penile tumescence testing helps distinguish psychogenic impotence from organic impotence For erectile dysfunction that stems from an organic cause, treatment aims to correct the underlying cause For dysfunction that results from a psychogenic cause, psychological counseling and sex therapy may help An external vacuum device may allow the patient to achieve a temporary erection Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, such as sildena l, vardena l, and tadala l, are the rst line of drug treatment The patient may bene t from a surgically inserted infl atable or semi-rigid penile prosthesis /H18546Nursing interventions Teach the patient and his partner about the disorder and treatment options Encourage the patient to discuss his concerns, and provide support; include the patient's partner in your care Assist with measures to determine a possible underlying organic cause Provide postoperative care after penile prosthesis surgery; monitor the patient for bleeding, swelling, and infection Teach the patient to avoid alcohol before engaging in sexual activity; teach about the proper use of medications to treat erectile dysfunction Refer the patient to a practitioner, nurse, psychologist, social worker, or counselor trained in sex therapy as needed Ovarian cancer /H18546Description Ovarian cancer is the most common fatal gynecologic cancer and the fth leading cause of cancer death in women; principal sources include the epithelial cells (serous, mucous, or endometrial cells), germ cells (in cases of teratoma or dysgerminoma), mesenchymal cells (in cells) Although uncon rmed, risk factors for ovarian cancer may include nulliparity; infertility or history of dif culty becoming pregnant; family history; previous breast, endometrial, or colon cancer; exposure to environmental carcinogens; lack of breast-feeding; use of fertility drugs; or use of talcum powder in the genital area Ovarian cancer can occur at any age but is most common between ages 50 and 60 The 5-year survival rate for stage I ovarian cancer is 55% to 90%; stage II, 0% to 40%; and /H18546Signs and symptoms Ovarian cancer typically doesn't produce any signs or symptoms until the advanced stages of the disease It should be suspected in women with irregular menses, early menopause, uterine bleeding before puberty or after menopause, or other signs of endocrine dysfunction, such as infertility and masculinization GI signs and symptoms\u2014such as abdominal discomfort and a feeling of fullness, abdominal disten- tion, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, fl atulence, and constipation\u2014may occur as the tumor enlarges Ovarian enlargement (or palpable ovaries before menarche or after menopause) suggests ovarian cancer Other signs and symptoms include urinary frequency and weight loss /H18546Diagnosis and treatment No early screening tests exist for ovarian cancer; Pap tests are abnormal in about 30% of women with ovarian cancer Because the ovaries are located deep in the abdomen, pelvic examination may not detect early dis- ease; diagnosis is made after biopsy of the tumor, during exploratory laparotomy CA-125 is a tumor marker speci c to epithelial ovarian cancer; signi cantly elevated CA-125 levels are usually found in patients with ovarian cancer Other diagnostic tools include transvaginal ultrasonography, urine estrogen levels, pregnanediol levels, CT scan, and pelvic X-rays Treatment depends on the cancer's stage, which is determined during exploratory laparotomy; during this procedure, a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy are performed to remove as much of the tumor as possible along with affected lymph nodes and other peritoneal structures Radiation therapy or chemotherapy is usually recommended with surgery, for all stages of the disease Radiation therapy techniques include external pelvic irradiation or intraperitoneal instillation of radioactive phosphorus Combination chemotherapy commonly consists of carboplatin and paclitaxel Patients may undergo a \"second-look\" laparotomy after treatment of the early stages to detect persistent disease Treatment of advanced ovarian cancer is usually palliative /H18546Nursing interventions for a patient with early ovarian cancer Assess the patient's and family's understanding of the disease, diagnostic tests, and treatments, and intervene accordingly Encourage the patient to discuss her fears and concerns; be aware that treatment for ovarian cancer can change the patient's body image and self-concept and that the diagnosis may come at a time of life when the patient is experiencing dif culty with the physical and sociocultural aspects of aging Evaluate the patient's support systems, and refer her to clergy members, home health care services, hospices, or support groups as needed /H18546Nursing interventions for a patient with advanced ovarian cancer Administer analgesics, as indicated Position and support the patient to promote comfort; also apply heat or cold, massage painful areas, use pillows, and teach the patient relaxation techniques and guided imagery /H18546Nursing interventions for a patient with early or advanced ovarian cancer Promote adequate nutritional intake by collaborating with the dietitian to determine what type of food the patient should eat, how much, and how often; assessing the need for supplements; administering antiemetics as prescribed; and providing meticulous oral hygiene to improve the patient's ability and desire to eat Prevent alterations in skin integrity Observe the patient's skin and mucous membranes for signs of impaired skin integrity; radiation therapy, chemotherapy, inadequate nutrition, and impaired mobility can increase the risk of skin breakdown and mucous membrane irritation Med-Surg_Chap16.indd ammatory disease 291 Provide oral hygiene and skin care to prevent stomatitis and skin breakdown Promote activity and position changes to prevent prolonged pressure and tissue necrosis /H18546Nursing interventions for a patient receiving intraperitoneal chemotherapy Intervene as appropriate for systemic chemotherapy (see Nursing implications in oncology care , page 357), and perform interventions speci c to intraperitoneal chemotherapy Warm the drug, which typically is given in 2 L of normal saline solution, to body temperature, and infuse it by gravity as rapidly as tolerated; to improve fl ow, check for kinks in the tubing or catheter obstruction, and encourage the patient to gently turn from side to side Gently irrigate the catheter with normal saline solution; use an I.V. infusion to promote fl ow as long as the catheter is patent After instillation, clamp the tubing and let the solution remain in the peritoneal cavity for 4 hours (the dwell time) Unclamp the drainage tubing after the dwell time to let fl uid drain out of the peritoneum; facilitate drainage by aspiration, frequent changes in patient position, Valsalva's maneuver, and application of mild pressure to the abdomen After drainage is completed, fl ush the catheter rst with preservative-free saline solution and then with heparinized saline, and remove the needle from the port; the drainage may be sent to the labora-tory for analysis Monitor the patient for fl uid and electrolyte imbalances related to chemotherapy-induced uid supplemented with potassium and magnesium on the evening before treat- ment, as prescribed Measure fl uid intake and output, and notify the practitioner if the 4-hour urine output falls below 240 mL Monitor electrolyte levels daily Monitor the patient for infection, and take steps to prevent it by using strict aseptic technique when handling the peritoneal access device and checking for local erythema, fever, and other signs of sepsis or peritonitis Check for alterations in respiratory status; keep the head of the bed elevated, and make sure that oxy- gen is nearby Watch for complications resulting from a detached or obstructed catheter; if severe pain occurs, stop the infusion and obtain X-rays to con rm catheter migration into the peritoneal cavity Promote comfort by administering antiemetics, pain medications, and sedatives as needed; also provide extra blankets because the patient may feel chilled during the procedure as a result of the instilled fl uids Prepare the patient for discharge by providing verbal and written instructions about pain medica- tions, adverse effects of chemotherapy, catheter care, activity restrictions, and follow-up treatment /H18546Nursing interventions for a patient undergoing other treatments Provide care related to abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic radiation therapy (see Cervical cancer, page 283) Provide care related to systemic chemotherapy (see Nursing implications in oncology care , page 357) Pelvic infl ammatory disease /H18546Description Pelvic infl ammatory disease (PID) refers to any acute, subacute, recurrent, or chronic infection of the oviducts and ovaries with adjacent tissue involvement PID includes infl ammation of the cervix (cervicitis), uterus ovaries (oophoritis) The infl ammation may extend to connective tissue that lies between the broad ligaments (parametritis) PID is typically caused by bacteria-usually gonorrheal and chlamydial organisms-but it may also result from a virus Normally, the cervical mucus and cervicovaginal fl ora serve as a protective barrier; when this bar- rier is altered or destroyed-for instance, from sexual activity or instrumentation-bacteria can enter the 291 Med-Surg_Chap16.indd 291 8/2/2011 3:01:36 PM292 Reproductive system disorders vagina and cervix and ascend and enter the uterine cavity, causing infl ammation of various structures; retrograde menstrual fl ow may help promote the ascent of such organisms Risk factors for PID include multiple sexual partners, a history of STIs, uterine infection after preg- nancy, and IUD insertion Complications include infertility, septicemia, pulmonary embolus, peritonitis, and shock /H18546Signs and symptoms PID may be asymptomatic; if signs and symptoms do occur, they may include low-grade fever, mal- aise, lower abdominal pain that worsens with intercourse, irregular vaginal bleeding, and purulent vaginal discharge Other signs and symptoms include pain during cervical examination and possibly a palpable adnexal mass /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Culture and sensitivity testing and Gram stain of endocervix or cul-de-sac secretions show the caus- ative causative agent The patient's C-reactive protein level, white blood cell count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are elevated Transvaginal ultrasonography thickened, fl fallopian tubes CT scan may show complex tubo-ovarian abscesses, and MRI may show images of soft tissue; these tests are useful not only for establishing the diagnosis of PID but also for detecting other processes responsible for symptoms Diagnostic laparoscopy identi es cul-de-sac fl uid, tubal distention, and masses in a pelvic abscess Treatment aims to eradicate the underlying infection with antibiotics Laparoscopy allows for drainage of pelvic abscesses, pelvic lavage, or lysis of adhesions If the patient develops a ruptured pelvic abscess-a life-threatening situation-she may require a total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy /H18546Nursing interventions Teach the patient about the disorder, including treatment options and how to prevent future infections Administer prescribed antibiotics and analgesics; if I.V. antibiotics are ordered, initiate I.V. access and ensure its patency Provide frequent perineal care; inspect the patient's perineal pads, noting the color and characteris- tics of drainage Use meticulous hand hygiene technique Encourage the patient to discuss her feelings about her condition and sexuality; offer emotional support Help her to develop effective coping strategies Palpate the patient's abdomen for pain and tenderness, noting any distention or rigidity; auscultate bowel sounds for changes Be alert for signs of peritonitis Prepare the patient and her family for possible surgery if an abscess develops or ruptures Provide appropriate postoperative care Before discharge, teach the patient to report any fever, increased vaginal discharge, or increases in pelvic pain to her practitioner Emphasize the importance of completing the full course of antibiotics to ensure complete eradication of the infection Prostate cancer /H18546Description Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the United States and the most common type of cancer overall, the most common type in black men, and the second most common type in American men older than age 55 Med-Surg_Chap16.indd 292 Med-Surg_Chap16.indd 292 8/2/2011 3:01:36 PM 8/2/2011 3:01:36 PMProstate 293 Risk factors for prostate cancer include advancing age; North American, African, and Northwestern European descent; a high-fat diet; physical inactivity; and a family history Adenocarcinoma is the type of tumor found in prostate cancer Common metastatic sites are the brain, lungs, bone, and lymph nodes /H18546Signs and symptoms Early prostate cancer is asymptomatic; in about 50% of patients, the disease is in the advanced stages or has metastasized by the time it's discovered As the disease progresses and the size of the neoplasm increases, urinary obstruction occurs, thereby producing dysuria, urinary frequency, blood in the ejaculate, urine retention, decreased size and force of the urinary stream, and hematuria Signs and symptoms of metastasis include hip pain, backache, rectal or perineal discomfort, anemia, nausea, weight loss, weakness, shortness of breath, and edema /H18546Diagnosis and treatment A rm nodule felt on digital rectal examination suggests prostate cancer; a biopsy of surgically removed tissue can con rm the diagnosis Other helpful diagnostic tests include serum acid phosphatase, PSA, and testosterone levels; bone scans to detect metastasis; and kidney function tests Treatment is based on the patient's age, overall health, symptoms, stage of the disease, and survival prognosis Radical perineal prostatectomy is the standard surgical procedure for patients with potentially cur- able disease; bilateral orchiectomy is commonly performed along with prostatectomy Curative radiation therapy may be indicated if the patient is in the early stages of prostate cancer; this treatment may preserve sexual functioning Palliative measures are indicated for patients with advanced tumors or signs of metastasis (see Palliative treatments for prostate cancer ) /H18546Nursing interventions Assess the patient's and family's understanding of the disease, diagnostic tests, and treatments, and intervene accordingly Encourage the patient to discuss his fears and concerns Evaluate the patient's support systems, and refer him to clergy members, home health care services, hospices, or support groups as needed Radiation therapy may be used for patients with late- stage disease. Because it alters cell growth and repro-duction through ionization, it affects cancerous\u2014and healthy\u2014cells. Suppressive hormone therapy may be used to decrease tumor size and relieve pain because prostatic adenocar-cinomas are hormone-dependent. Suppression may be achieved by orchiectomy or administration of drugs, such as luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs, anti-androgens, and other androgen-suppressing drugs (such as diethylstilbestrol). Chemotherapy may slow the disease process and provide palliative relief. It directly interferes with the biochemistry of the cancer cells, altering their growth, metabolism, and reproduction. Cryosurgery, which freezes the target tissue, is another palliative measure used for locally recurrent disease. Repeated transurethral resections of the prostate may be needed to maintain urine fl ow. Eventually, permanent urinary or suprapubic catheterization may be needed. Corticosteroids and neurosurgery may relieve pain by interrupting pain receptors in the spinal cord.Palliative treatments for prostate cancer Several palliative treatments may be used for a patient with advanced or metastatic prostate Evaluate the patient's response to pain control; notify the practitioner if pain-control measures are ineffective Promote comfort by applying heat or ice, massaging painful areas, providing pillows and a rm mattress, and teaching the patient to use relaxation techniques and guided imagery Monitor the patient for complications of radiation therapy, such as systemic adverse reactions (including nausea, vomiting, headache, skin reactions, fatigue, and malaise) and transitory proctitis and cystitis Monitor the patient for complications of chemotherapy (see Nursing implications in oncology care, page 357); handle chemotherapeutic agents according to federal safety guidelines Promote adequate nutritional intake by collaborating with the dietitian to determine what types of food the patient should eat, how much, and how often; assessing the need for supplements; administer-ing antiemetics as prescribed; and providing meticulous oral hygiene to improve the patient's ability and desire to eat Prevent alterations in skin integrity by observing the patient's skin and mucous membranes for signs of impaired skin integrity; radiation therapy, chemotherapy, inadequate nutrition, and impaired mobil-ity can predispose him to skin breakdown and mucous membrane irritation Provide oral hygiene and skin care to prevent stomatitis and skin breakdown Promote activity and position changes to prevent prolonged pressure and tissue necrosis Maintain adequate urinary elimination Determine the patient's urinary elimination pattern Monitor him for urine retention; record the frequency and amount of urine output, and assess him for urinary urgency, dysuria, and suprapubic distention Facilitate bladder emptying Ensure adequate fl uid intake, and encourage the patient to urinate when he feels the need Help the patient to a normal position for voiding when possible, and unless contraindicated, have him use Valsalva's maneuver to initiate urine fl ow Administer cholinergics, as prescribed, to stimulate bladder contraction Determine whether the patient needs intermittent or indwelling urinary catheterization Assess the patient's potential for injury, and take safety precautions; bone metastasis, pain, weak- ness, and peripheral neuropathy may predispose the patient to falls or other injuries Prepare the patient for discharge Provide sexual counseling, emotional support related to alopecia, and self-catheterization and catheter care instructions as needed Teach the patient exercises to strengthen the perineal muscles Caution the patient to avoid taking rectal temperatures and to allow suppositories to reach room temperature before inserting them into the rectum Provide referrals for home health care and other services as needed Provide verbal and written instructions about prescribed medications, activity restrictions, diet, and follow-up care Sexually transmitted diseases /H18546Description STDs are the most common infections in the United States; acquired immunode ciency syndrome (AIDS), herpes, gonorrhea, and hepatitis are considered epidemic (see Chapter 17, Immune system dis-orders, for details on AIDS) These contagious diseases are usually transmitted through intimate sexual contact with an infected person; some are transmitted to an infant during pregnancy or childbirth People younger than age 25, those with multiple sex partners, and those with a history of STDs are at higher risk for infection; the incidence of STDs is higher among prostitutes and people having sexual contact with prostitutes, drug abusers, or prison inmates Morbidity and mortality depend on the type and stage of STD; many STDs are easy to treat when detected early 294 Med-Surg_Chap16.indd 294 8/2/2011 3:01:36 PM 8/2/2011 3:01:36 PMSexually transmitted diseases 295 STDs can be prevented by educating the public, identifying and treating partners and contacts of infected people, and identifying and treating symptomatic or asymptomatic infected patients; barrier methods of contraception, such as a condom and a diaphragm with spermicide, reduce the risk of certain infections More than 21 diseases are classi ed as STDs; they're caused by bacteria, viruses, protozoans, fungi, and ectoparasites /H18546Signs and symptoms The chief signs of STDs are vaginitis, recurrent vaginitis, epididymitis, lower abdominal pain, pharyngitis, proctitis, and skin or mucous membrane lesions Many STDs are asymptomatic, especially in women; by the time the STD is detected, the woman may have severe complications, such as PID, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, or chronic pelvic pain /H18546Diagnosis and treatment The diagnosis of a speci c STD is made by physical examination, patient history, and laboratory tests to determine the causative organism Treatment is based on the speci c causative organism; treatment guidelines for each STD are available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (see Sexually transmitted diseases, page 296) The CDC recommends that speci c resources be available for patients with STDs: medical evalua- tion and treatment facilities for patients with HIV infection; hospitalization facilities for patients with complicated STDs, such as PID and disseminated gonococcal infection; referrals for medical, pediatric, infectious disease, dermatologic, and services; family-planning services; and sub-stance abuse treatment programs /H18546Nursing interventions Develop a therapeutic relationship with the patient that fosters trust and preserves the patient's dig- nity; ensure privacy and con dentiality, and avoid judging the patient's lifestyle and making assump- tions about his sexual preference Provide emotional support, and encourage the patient to discuss feelings; he may be anxious and fearful and may experience altered self-esteem and self-image Teach the patient about the STD and its treatment Discuss disease transmission, signs and symptoms, the length of the infectious period, infection prevention, and cure (if the STD can be cured) Discuss the health consequences of improper treatment, and emphasize that the patient's partner is also at risk Clarify common misconceptions and promote understanding of healthful sexual practices Inform the patient that washing his hands and genital area before and after sexual contact doesn't prevent STDs Encourage the patient to urinate after intercourse Advise women to avoid douching because it can alter the normal vaginal fl ora Tell the patient that condoms and a diaphragm with spermicide may provide some protection against certain STDs, but IUDs and birth control pills don't Encourage a sexually active patient who has multiple partners and no STD symptoms to have an STD examination twice a year Tell the patient to seek immediate treatment if STD symptoms develop Inform the patient that treatment doesn't provide immunity from the same or a different STD Advise the patient to abstain from sexual activity until the posttreatment follow-up veri es a cure Discuss modi cations of sexual activity to prevent recurrence: reducing the number of sex part- ners, avoiding partners who have multiple partners, and questioning partners about their STD history Teach the patient about the prescribed medication and its dosing schedule and adverse effects; stress the importance of completing the medication regimen, even if symptoms disappear; advise the patient to return if he develops any adverse reactions so that another drug can be prescribed Med-Surg_Chap16.indd 295 Med-Surg_Chap16.indd 295 8/2/2011 3:01:36 PM 8/2/2011 3:01:36 PM296 Reproductive system disorders Name and organismPossible signs and symptoms Treatment Special considerations Chlamydia Chlamydia trachomatis Purulent discharge Males: epididymitis Females: usually asymptomaticDoxycycline or azithromycin All sexual contacts must be treated. Potential complications in females are pelvic infl ammatory disease (PID), infertility, and spontaneous abortion; in males, urethritis, epididymitis, and prostatitis. Patient should take medication as prescribed, follow up in 7 to 10 days, and abstain from sexual activity until treatment is completed. Genital herpes, herpes simplex Type 2 Females: purulent vaginal discharge Multiple vesicles on the genital area, buttocks, or thighs Painful dysuria Fever Headache MalaiseFamciclovir, valacyclovir, or acyclovir; topical anesthetic ointment Warm baths and mild analgesics may relieve pain. Patient should avoid sexual activity during the prodromal stage and during outbreaks until all lesions have dried up. Many patients have recurrences every 2 to 3 months; local hyperesthesias may occur 24 hours before the outbreak lesions. Neisseria doxycycline All sexual contacts must be treated. Potential complications in females are PID, sterility, and ectopic pregnancy; in males, prostatitis, urethritis, epididymitis, and sterility. Patient should take medication as prescribed, follow up in 7 to 10 days, and abstain from sexual activity until treatment is completed. Human papillomavirus (HPV) Pink-gray soft lesions, singularly or 25% or imiquimod to lesions; cryosurgery receive frequent Papanicolaou tests. HPV has an 80% chance of recurrence.

Complications in females include recurrent infections and salpingitis. Patient should take medication as prescribed, follow up in 7 to 10 days, and abstain from sexual activity until treatment is completed. Patients should avoid alcohol during treatment and for at least 3 days after its completion.Sexually transmitted the patient about lesion care, including soaking in a tub two to three times a day, keeping lesions clean and dry between baths, wearing cotton underwear, avoiding panty hose and restrictive clothing, and avoiding creams, lotions, and ointments except those speci cally prescribed Refer the patient to other social and health services as needed Report the STD according to local health department or state health board requirements Testicular cancer /H18546Description Testicular cancer is the most common type of cancer in men between ages 15 and 35; it's the third leading cause of death in these men but has an overall cure rate of 95% when detected early Although the cause of testicular cancer is unknown, incidence is higher in men with cryptorchidism; the disease is also associated with scrotal trauma, heredity, infection, hormonal abnormalities, and orchiopexy (surgical repair of undescended testis) Testicular ed as seminomas or nonseminomas Seminomas typically are localized and highly sensitive to radiation therapy; the prognosis is good with early treatment Nonseminomas are faster growing and more diffuse; they require more aggressive treatment with surgery and chemotherapy Educating men to perform testicular self-examination facilitates earlier detection and intervention; however, many patients don't seek treatment for 3 to 6 months after detecting a tumor /H18546Signs and symptoms Most patients with testicular cancer report unilateral testicular enlargement, a \"dragging\" sensation in the lower abdomen, and heaviness in the scrotum; 70% to 90% of patients don't report pain as an early symptom A patient with a palpable tumor that doesn't transluminate may have testicular cancer A patient with metastasis to retroperitoneal lymph nodes may report lower back pain, lymphade- nopathy, fatigue, weight loss, and anorexia; the next most common site of metastasis is the lungs The patient also may experience breast enlargement and tenderness /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis of suspected testicular cancer is based on the patient's symptoms and history, testicular examination, urine ultrasonog-raphy; radioimmunoassay studies, which measure antigens produced by malignant cells, aid in diagnosis Excretory urography may be used to evaluate renal function and structure; chest X-ray, CT, and MRI are used to evaluate metastasis The histologic diagnosis is made by inguinal orchiectomy; testicular biopsy isn't done because it can promote the spread of tumor cells Testicular cancer is treated with radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery; one, two, or all three of these treatments may be used, depending on the stage of the disease and the type of tumor (see Treatment for testicular cancer, page 298) /H18546Nursing interventions for a patient in the early stages of testicular cancer Assess the patient's and family's understanding of the disease, diagnostic tests, and treatments, and intervene accordingly Encourage the patient to discuss his fears and concerns; clarify misconceptions, and be aware that orchiectomy can change the patient's body image and self-concept; discuss the possibility of joining a sperm bank if sterility is a concern /H18546Nursing interventions for a patient undergoing orchiectomy Monitor the patient for complications of anesthesia and hemorrhage immediately after surgery Prepare the patient for discharge Teach the patient and family about wound care at home Provide verbal and written instructions about pain medications, activity restrictions (including sexual activity), and follow-up /H18546Nursing interventions for a patient undergoing retroperitoneal lymph node dissection Observe the patient for postoperative complications, such as and fl uid and electrolyte status Initiate leg and breathing exercises and early ambulation to prevent circulatory, respiratory, and GI complications Assess the patient's pain and response to analgesia; patient-controlled analgesia is an effective way of administering opioids Prepare the patient for discharge Provide verbal and written instructions about pain medications, activity restrictions, and follow- up care Tell the patient to avoid lifting and straining until after he returns to the practitioner for his 6-week postoperative visit Inform the patient that sexual activity generally can be resumed in 4 to 6 weeks /H18546Nursing interventions for a patient receiving chemotherapy Be fully knowledgeable about the prescribed chemotherapeutic agents, including their administra- tion protocols, therapeutic and adverse effects, and speci c nursing considerations; handle chemothera- peutic agents according to federal safety guidelines Monitor and treat the patient for complications of chemotherapy (see Nursing implications in oncology care, page 357) Prepare the patient for discharge Provide verbal and written instructions about pain medications, wound care, activity restrictions (including sexual activity), and follow-up care Make sure the patient understands how to manage the adverse effects of chemotherapy Teach the patient how to perform testicular self-examination; patients who have had testicular can- cer are at higher risk for developing another tumor than those who haven't had the disease Tell the patient about the need for follow-up visits; recurrence is most common in the rst year after treatmentRadiation therapy Radiation therapy is primarily used to treat pure seminomas after surgery because these tumors are highly sensitive to radiation. It also may be indicated for patients who are poor candidates for surgery or who don't respond to chemo-therapy. To preserve fertility, the unaffected testis is shielded to prevent irradiation. Chemotherapy When used with surgery, chemotherapy has provided the most effective treatment of nonseminoma tumors. Cisplatin commonly is used to treat testicular cancer in combination with bleomycin, etoposide, vinblastine, ifosfamide, and cyclophosphamide.Surgery Unilateral radical orchiectomy is performed through an in- guinal incision. It typically is a 1-day surgical procedure per-formed under local or spinal anesthesia, depending on the patient's health status. It may be the only surgery needed for patients with stage I and II seminomas who also undergo postoperative radiation therapy. Orchiectomy and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) are used to treat stage II and III disease. Because RPLND is major abdominal surgery, it poses all the associ-ated risks and potential complications. Therefore, the patient is monitored closely after surgery. RPLND typically is per-formed after the staging orchiectomy and intensive chemo-therapy. A unilateral (modi ed) RPLND is performed, unless regional metastasis is present. After full RPLND, orgasm and libido remain intact, but the patient is sterile.Treatment for testicular cancer Testicular cancer may be treated with radiation therap y, chemotherapy, surgery, or any combination of these. Med-Surg_Chap16.indd Med-Surg_Chap16.indd 299 /H18546Nursing interventions for a patient receiving radiation therapy Observe the patient for complications of treatment; common systemic adverse reactions include nau- sea, vomiting, headache, skin reactions, fatigue, and malaise Check for alterations in skin integrity Uterine leiomyomas /H18546Description Uterine leiomyomas\u2014also known as myomas, bromyomas the most common benign uterine tumors; they're malignant in less than 0.1% of patients The tumors, composed of smooth muscle, usually occur in the uterine corpus, although they may appear on the cervix or on the round or broad ligament Classi ed according to location, these tumors may be located within the uterine wall (intramural) or protrude into the endometrial cavity (submucous) or from the serosal surface of the uterus (subserous) The tumors are typically rm and surrounded by a pseudocapsule composed of compressed but oth- erwise normal uterine myometrium Uterine leiomyomas may cause the uterine cavity to become larger, increasing the endometrial sur- face area, which can increase uterine bleeding Tumor size varies greatly; possible regulators of leiomyoma growth include several growth factors (including epidermal growth factor) as well as steroid hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone Although the cause of uterine leiomyomas is unknown, they may be correlated with estrogen stimu- lation; the tumors typically arise after menarche and regress after menopause, implicating estrogen as a promoter of leiomyoma growth Uterine leiomyomas affect three times as many black women as white women; they may occur at any age but are most common in women ages 40 to 50 Complications include spontaneous abortion, preterm labor, anemia secondary to excessive bleeding, infection, infertility, and bowel obstruction; the tumors may also mask signs of endometrial or ovarian cancer /H18546Signs and symptoms This disorder commonly causes no symptoms If signs and symptoms do occur, they may include a history of abnormal menstrual bleeding, urinary frequency, or incontinence; abdominal cramping during menstruation; pelvic pressure; and lower back pain A physical examination may reveal abdominal distention; palpable rm, smooth nodules; or mobile, painless masses /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Blood tests may show anemia from abnormal bleeding, which may support the diagnosis Ultrasonography allows an accurate assessment of the dimension, number, and location of tumors; MRI may reveal calci ed broids Hysterosalpingography may detect myomas Fractional dilation and curettage helps to rule out cervical and uterine cancers Laparoscopy helps to rule out other pelvic diseases and disorders An endometrial biopsy may rule out endometrial cancer in patients who have abnormal uterine bleeding and are older than age 35 Treatment is conservative for asymptomatic myomas, with the patient undergoing pelvic examina- tion and ultrasonography every 3 to 6 months if the size remains stable Progestins, such as norethindrone or medroxyprogesterone, reduce overall uterine size; a combina- tion of oral contraceptives prevents the development of new myomas A luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, such as nafarelin, goserelin, arti cial menopause to promote atrophy of myomas Iron supplements, as indicated, treat anemia Nonsteroidal anti-infl ammatory drugs provide pain relief Surgical measures include or hysteroscopic myomas Uterine artery embolization (a radiologic procedure) blocks the uterine arteries using small pieces of polyvinylchloride Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasonography surgery causes coagulative necrosis of myomas Severe cases of the disorder may require hysterectomy /H18546Nursing interventions Teach the patient and family about the diagnosis and treatments, including medications, surgery, and uterine artery embolization if indicated; explain that myomas typically regress after menopause Administer iron supplements and blood transfusions as ordered for a patient with severe anemia from excessive bleeding Encourage frequent rest periods if the patient experiences fatigue related to anemia Give goserelin subcutaneously, leuprolide I.M., and nafarelin by nasal spray, as ordered Encourage the patient to use prescribed pain medications as ordered for pain relief Encourage the patient to verbalize her feelings, questions, and concerns about the disease and its effects on her lifestyle; provide clear explanations, and answer any questions Reinforce the patient's self-esteem Urge the patient to participate in self-care activities and decision making to foster a sense of control Reassure the patient that she won't experience premature menopause if her ovaries are left intact Prepare the patient physically and psychologically for surgery as indicated Provide preoperative and postoperative care as appropriate Teach about the importance of regular gynecologic examinations, including pelvic evaluations and ultrasonography for newly diagnosed symptomatic or excessively large myomas; laboratory testing, such as hemoglobin levels and hematocrit for excessive uterine bleeding; and monitoring once uterine size and symptoms stabilize Review questions 1. Which patient has the highest risk of ovarian cancer? /H18540A. A 30-year-old woman taking an oral contraceptive /H18540B. A 45-year-old woman who has never been pregnant /H18540C. A 40-year-old woman with three children /H18540D. A 36-year-old woman who had her rst child at age 22 Correct answer: B The incidence of ovarian cancer increases in women who have never been pregnant, are older than age 40, are infertile, or have menstrual irregularities. Other risk factors include a fam-ily history of breast, bowel, or endometrial cancer. The risk of ovarian cancer hasn't been linked to oral contraceptives (Option A), multiple births (Option C), or having a rst child at a young age (Option D). 2. A patient with a small, well-de ned breast nodule asks the nurse about her treatment options. Which treatments would be considered for this patient? /H18540A. Lumpectomy and radiation /H18540B. Partial mastectomy and radiation /H18540C. Partial mastectomy and chemotherapy /H18540D. Total mastectomy and chemotherapy Correct answer: A Treatment for breast cancer depends on the disease stage and type, the patient's age and menopausal status, and the dis guring effects of the surgery. For this patient, lumpectomy is the most likely option. Lumpectomy involves a small incision with removal of the surrounding tissue and, Med-Surg_Chap16.indd 300 Med-Surg_Chap16.indd 300 8/2/2011 3:01:36 PM 8/2/2011 3:01:36 PMReview questions 301 possibly, the nearby lymph nodes. The patient usually undergoes radiation therapy afterward. With par- tial mastectomy (Options B and C), the tumor is removed along with a wedge of normal tissue, skin, and possibly axillary lymph nodes. With a total (simple) mastectomy (Option D), the entire breast is removed. 3. The nurse is assessing a male patient with gonorrhea. Which symptom most likely prompted him to seek medical attention? /H18540A. Rashes on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet /H18540B. Caulifl ower-like warts on the penis /H18540C. Painful red papules on the shaft of the penis /H18540D. Foul-smelling discharge from the penis Correct answer: D Signs and symptoms of gonorrhea in men include purulent, foul-smelling drainage from the penis and painful urination. Rash on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (Option A) is a sign of the secondary stage of syphilis. Caulifl ower-like warts on the penis (Option B) are a sign of human papillomavirus. Painful red papules on the shaft of the penis (Option C) may be a sign of the rst stage of genital herpes. 4. The nurse is speaking to a group of women about early detection of breast cancer. The average age of the women in the group is 47. Following the American Cancer Society guidelines, the nurse should recommend that the women: /H18540A. perform BSE annually. /H18540B. have a mammogram annually. /H18540C. have a hormonal receptor assay annually. /H18540D. have a practitioner conduct a clinical examination every 2 years. Correct answer: B The American Cancer Society guidelines state \"Women older than age 40 should have a mammogram annually and a clinical examination at least annually; all women should perform breast self-examination monthly.\" Option A is incorrect because women should perform BSE monthly. The hormonal receptor assay (Option C) is done on a known breast tumor to determine whether the tumor is estrogen- or progesterone-dependent. Option D is incorrect because women older than age 40 should have an annual clinical examination. 5. The nurse is teaching a male patient to perform monthly testicular self-examinations. What is the appropri- ate point cancer is highly cult to diagnose. /H18540C. Testicular cancer is the number one cause of cancer deaths in men. /H18540D. Testicular cancer is more common in older men. Correct answer: A Testicular cancer is highly curable, particularly when it's treated in its early stage. Option B is incorrect because self-examination allows early detection and facilitates the early initiation of treatment. Option C is incorrect because the highest mortality rates from cancer among men are in men with lung cancer. Option D is incorrect because testicular cancer is found more commonly in younger men.

On a follow-up visit after having a vaginal hysterectomy, a 32-year-old patient has an elevated temperature and decreased hematocrit. Which complication does elevated temperature and decreased hematocrit are signs of hematoma, a delayed complication of abdominal and vaginal hysterectomy. Signs of hypovolemia (option B) include increased hematocrit and hemoglobin values. Although elevated temperature is a classic sign of infection (Option C), a decreased hematocrit isn't. Although abrupt onset of fever is a sign of thromboembolism (Option D), other signs and symptoms include dyspnea, chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, restlessness, and indications of shock, which the patient doesn't have. 7. An annual Pap test is most important in patients: /H18540A. with a history of recurrent candidiasis. /H18540B. who became pregnant before age 20. /H18540C. infected with HPV. /H18540D. who have used oral contraceptives for a short time. Correct answer: C Cervical cancer is attributed to HPV in 90% of cases. Recurrent candidiasis (Option A), becoming pregnant before age 20 (Option B), and using oral contraceptives for a short time (Option D) don't increase the risk of cervical cancer. 8. When planning to teach an adolescent female patient about PID, which of the following statements should the nurse include? /H18540A. \"Good hygiene practices prevent the development of PID.\" /H18540B. \"The use of hormonal contraceptives decreases the risk of PID.\" /H18540C. \"PID can lead to long-term complications of the reproductive tract.\" /H18540D. \"Infants born to adolescents with PID are at risk for birth defects.\" Correct answer: C Long-term complications of PID include abscess formation in the fallopian tubes and adhesion formation, which can lead to an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy or infertility. Good hygiene practices don't prevent PID (Option A), and using hormonal contraceptives doesn't decrease the risk (Option B), although some forms of contraception-such as the male or female condom-do help to decrease the incidence. An infant born to an adolescent with PID isn't at greater risk for birth defects (Option D). 9. Perineal pain in the absence of any observable cause suggests which condition? /H18540A. Endometriosis /H18540B. Internal Correct answer: C Prostatitis can cause prostate pain, which is felt as perineal pain or discomfort. Endo- metriosis (Option A) can cause pain low in the abdomen, deep in the pelvis, or in the rectal or sacrococ-cygeal area, depending on the location of the ectopic tissue. Hemorrhoids (Option B) cause rectal pain and pressure. Renal calculi (Option D) typically produce fl ank pain. 302 8/2/2011 3:01:37 PM 8/2/2011 3:01:37 PM10. Which statement should the nurse include when teaching a patient newly diagnosed with testicular cancer? /H18540A. \"Testicular cancer isn't responsive to chemotherapy, but it's highly curative with surgery.\" /H18540B. \"Radiation therapy is never used so that the unaffected testicle can remain healthy.\" /H18540C. \"Testicular self-examination is still important because having testicular cancer increases the risk of developing a second tumor.\" /H18540D. \"Taking testosterone after orchiectomy prevents changes in appearance and sexual function.\" Correct answer: C Because a history of a testicular malignancy puts the patient at increased risk for a second tumor, testicular self-examination becomes critical to improving the chances of early detection. Patients who have evidence of metastasis after irradiation receive chemotherapy (Option A). Radiation therapy is used on the retroperitoneal lymph nodes (Option B). Testosterone typically is not needed because the unaffected testis usually produces suf cient hormone (Option D).Review questions 3:01:37 PM304 Introduction /H18546The immune system is a complex organization of highly specialized cells and tissue that protect the body from various foreign organisms /H18546The bone marrow and thymus manufacture the immune cells, which work together with lymphoid tissue to destroy foreign organisms that enter the body; B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes are the primary cells of the immune system /H18546Nursing history The nurse asks the patient about his chief complaint The patient with an immunologic disorder reports vague signs and symptoms, such as lack of energy, light-headedness, frequent infections or bruising, and slow wound healing The nurse then questions the patient about his present illness Ask the patient about his symptom, including when it started, associated symptoms, location, radiation, intensity, duration, frequency, and precipitating and alleviating factors Ask about the use of prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, herbal remedies, vitamin and nutritional supplements, and alternative therapies The nurse asks about the medical history Question the patient about changes in overall health, allergies, childhood diseases, recurrent infec- tions, and immunizations Ask about unexplained rashes, visual disturbances, fever, and changes in elimination patterns Question the patient about a history of immune disorders Ask the female patient about changes in menstrual patterns The nurse then assesses the family history Ask about a family history of immune disorders Also ask about a family history of recurrent infections, allergies, and cancer The nurse obtains a social history Ask about work, exercise, diet, use of recreational drugs and alcohol, and hobbies Also ask about stress, support systems, and coping mechanisms Question the patient about exposure to chemicals and pathogens /H18546Physical assessment The nurse begins with inspection Inspect the patient's appearance, and note signs of acute and chronic illness, pain, fatigue, and malnutrition Observe the patient's movements, posture, gait, coordination, balance, range of motion (ROM), and strength Inspect the skin, noting color, rashes, and lesions; evaluate skin integrity Note hair growth, including texture, distribution, color, and amount Check the nose for evidence of chronic allergies; observe mucous membranes for ulcers, patches, and plaques; and observe the eyes for redness, infection, and hydration Inspect the extremities for blanching, cyanosis, pallor, edema, and reddening Assess level of consciousness and mental status, noting behavior, emotional stability, and cognition17Immune system disordersImmune system disorders PM 8/2/2011 3:10:08 PMThe immune response 305 Next, the nurse performs palpation and percussion Take the patient's vital signs Feel the lymph nodes, noting any enlargement or tenderness Palpate and percuss various organs, noting enlargement, infl ammation, masses, or tenderness Assess musculoskeletal integrity and ROM, particularly in the hands, wrists, and knees Palpate the joints to detect nodules, swelling, tenderness, and pain Then the nurse performs auscultation Listen to the lungs, noting abnormal breath sounds Auscultate the heart, listening for abnormal sounds, rhythm, and rate Listen for bowel sounds in all abdominal quadrants The immune response /H18546General information The primary function of the immune system is to protect the body against pathogenic microorgan- isms and malignant cells The immune response is a complex sequence of events triggered by a stimulus (antigen) and culmi- nating in the elimination of the foreign substance; the process requires the differentiation of intrinsic organisms from foreign organisms Antigens (immunogens) are any substances recognized as foreign that stimulate an immune response; viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites are antigens Antibodies (immunoglobulins) are proteins that are formed in response to exposure to an antigen The following factors can decrease the immune response: genetics, age extremes, protein-calorie malnutrition, vitamin or mineral de ciency, certain drugs, radiation, and stress /H18546Natural immunity Natural, innate immunity is the body's rst line of defense against invading pathogens; this nonspeci c mechanism can differentiate intrinsic from foreign organisms but can't identify the speci c pathogen Types of natural immunity include physical barriers, such as intact skin and mucous membranes; chemical barriers, such as gastric acidity and enzymes in the saliva; and infl ammation, which is the sequence of vascular and cellular responses to tissue injury and immunologic stimuli (see Chapter 6, Disruptions in homeostasis, for details) /H18546Acquired immunity Adaptive, acquired immunity is the body's second line of defense; it's gained through exposure to pathogens, distinguishes intrinsic from foreign organisms, identi es the speci c pathogen, and responds to previously encountered pathogens Four types of acquired immunity exist Passive immunity occurs when antibodies, such as immunoglobulin, of an infectious agent are sup- plied to the host's body, providing temporary immunity; antibodies may be obtained by injection, or they may be transferred from mother to neonate Active immunity results from direct exposure to an antigen by immunization (such as by tetanus toxoid) or exposure to disease Humoral immunity , primarily mediated by B cells, is the body's ability to respond to antigens by forming speci c antibodies; the term humoral indicates that immunity is transferable by serum Cell-mediated immunity is primarily mediated by T cells and macrophages, which are responsible for antigen destruction and delayed hypersensitivity; unlike humoral immunity, cell-mediated immunity isn't readily transferred to another person by serum /H18546Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions are destructive immune responses that occur after reexposure to an antigen; they can produce various symptoms within minutes to several days Hypersensitivity reactions may be humoral or cell mediated (see Types of hypersensitivity, page syndrome /H18546Description Acquired immunode ciency syndrome (AIDS) is characterized by a progressive compromise of the immune system To provide statistical data for public health purposes, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed a case de nition for AIDS, based on laboratory evidence of human immunode - ciency virus (HIV) infection and indicator diseases (a seropositive HIV test and laboratory con rmation of one of the indicator diseases supports a diagnosis of AIDS) The CDC also has developed a classi cation method that covers the spectrum of the progression of HIV infection (see Classi cation system for HIV infection and expanded AIDS surveillance case de nition for adolescents and adults ) AIDS is caused by infection with HIV type 1 (HIV-1) or HIV type 2 (HIV-2); HIV is a retrovirus that selectively infects cells with a CD4+ surface marker, usually T4 lymphocytes HIV is transmitted primarily through sexual intercourse, during which blood, semen, and vaginal secretions are shared HIV is also transmitted through contaminated blood that enters the body by way of parenteral or percutaneous routes or by way of mucous membranes or open wounds; such transmission can result from sharing or accidental injection with a contaminated needle, transfusion of contaminated blood, or perinatal transfer in the womb, during birth, or through breast milk HIV infection reduces cell-mediated immunity by destroying T4 lymphocytesThe following chart summarizes the four major types of hypersensitivity. Type and description Effects Common causes Type I (immediate type) Humoral hypersensitivity mediated by immunoglobulin (Ig) E antibodies Local reactions, such as allergic rhinitis and urticaria Systemic, life-threatening (anaphylac- tic) reactions that can lead to respiratory distress and shock Hay fever, drugs, and foods (local reactions) Penicillin allergy and insect stings (systemic reactions) Diagnostic agents Type II (tissue-speci c) Humoral hypersensitivity (cytotoxic or cytolytic cell-speci c Infl ammation, phagocytosis, and cell breakdown through complement system activation Blood transfusion reaction Hemolytic disease of the newborn Type III (immune complex- mediated) Humoral hypersensitivity (immune complex reaction) mediated by IgG or IgM antibodies; tissue versus cell-speci c Itching and discomfort at the injection site (early) Lymphadenopathy, fever, urticaria, and joint pain (late) Drugs such as penicillin Serum sickness, caused by injection of bovine or equine serum antitoxin, renal damage, and cell-mediated) Cell-mediated hypersensitivity (T cell-mediated reaction) Delayed response caused by direct or indirect antigen destruction Poison ivy Graft rejection Tuberculin reaction 307 Diagnostic categories As of January 1, 1993, people with acquired immunode ciency syndrome (AIDS) indicator conditions (clinical category C) and those in categories A3 or B3 were considered to have AIDS.

these cells may be responsible for transporting the virus to other organs, such as the brain and lungs /H18546Signs and symptoms HIV infection may be asymptomatic or cause a mononucleosis-like syndrome associated with seroconversion; symptoms include headache, rash, malaise, and swollen lymph nodes and last about 2 weeks (see AIDS indicator diseases, page 310) Persistent generalized lymphadenopathy at two or more extrainguinal sites may persist for more than 3 months in the absence of concurrent illness The infected patient also may display signs of opportunistic infections and other diseases HIV can produce central nervous system effects AIDS dementia complex, also called HIV encephalopathy, causes cognitive changes, such as con- fusion, impaired concentration, and memory loss; motor disturbances, such as ataxia, leg weakness, and diminished ne motor movements; and behavioral changes, such as apathy, depression, reduced spontaneity, social withdrawal, anxiety, agitation, and personality changes Atypical aseptic meningitis causes headache, fever, and signs of meningeal infection Vacuolar myelopathy (spinal cord degeneration) may produce leg weakness, incontinence, and ataxia HIV wasting syndrome may occur as a complication of advanced HIV infection; it's associated with involuntary weight loss of more than 10% of body weight and diarrhea, recurrent or sustained fevers, and chronic weakness for more than 1 month in the absence of a causative illness, such as cancer or tuberculosis /H18546Diagnosis and treatment The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detects the presence of HIV-1 antibodies; if a patient's blood has a positive reaction on two ELISA tests, the Western blot test is used to con rm the results The Western blot test detects the presence of HIV antibodies and determines their type HIV infection is characterized by a progressive decline of the CD4+ T-cell count over months to years A CD4+ T-cell count of less than 200 cells/ mL is diagnostic of AIDS and indicates that the patient is at risk for an opportunistic infection Polymerase chain reaction may detect viral genetic material (HIV ribonucleic acid [HIV RNA]) in patients for whom antibodies haven't yet developed Other laboratory tests may include hematocrit (below 30%, indicating anemia), white blood cell (WBC) count (below 2,500/cm3, indicating leukopenia), the ratio of helper T cells to suppressor T cells (decreased to 1:2), and platelet count (below 100,000/mm3) Because many opportunistic infections are reactivations of previous infections, the patient may also be tested for syphilis, hepatitis B, tuberculosis, and toxoplasmosis Drug therapy for HIV infection includes six types of antiretrovirals Protease inhibitors, maraviroc (Selzentry) such as enfuviritide, which interfere with the virus' ability to fuse with the cellular membrane, thereby blocking entry into the host cell These antiretrovirals are used in various combinations to inhibit HIV viral replication; this is called highly active antiretroviral therapy HAART ciency syndrome 309 Treatment protocols combine two or more drugs in an effort to gain the maximum bene t with the fewest adverse reactions Combination therapy helps to inhibit the production of resistant, mutant strains Combination agents that combine two or three drugs in one dose are available and help improve compliance Different treatments are required for AIDS indicator diseases (see AIDS indicator diseases, page 310) /H18546Nursing interventions Provide respiratory care Encourage activity, as tolerated, to prevent fatigue and dyspnea Administer medications, as prescribed, to relieve symptoms and prevent or treat infection Monitor vital signs and laboratory values (arterial blood gas levels, oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry, sputum cultures, CD4+ count, and complete blood count [CBC]) to determine the effective-ness of treatment Provide pulmonary hygiene (including coughing and deep breathing every 2 hours), splinting while coughing, and suctioning to prevent atelectasis and clear airway secretions; maintain adequate hydration to thin mucus secretions Provide throat lozenges and warm saline gargles to soothe an irritated throat Administer antitussives and expectorants, as prescribed, for cough If appropriate, help the patient to decrease or stop smoking Perform GI care Monitor fl uid intake and output, weight, urine speci c gravity, serum electrolyte levels, and skin turgor to evaluate hydration Obtain stool cultures to identify enteric pathogens Encourage the patient to drink at least 3 qt (3 L) of fl uid daily; administer I.V. therapy, as pre- scribed, to maintain hydration Administer antibiotics and antivirals to treat infectious diarrhea and antidiarrheals to lessen the severity of diarrhea Promote good nutrition Offer small, frequent meals to reduce fatigue Engage the patient in menu planning, and invite the patient's family and friends to meals to encourage eating Allowing the patient to include personal food preferences gives him some control over the diet Eating with others may improve appetite Encourage the patient to eat meals sitting up and out of bed; sitting up aids digestion and decreases the risk of aspiration Provide a low-residue, high-protein, high-potassium, high-calorie, lactose-free diet to minimize diarrhea and maximize caloric, electrolyte, and fl uid intake Use oral dietary supplements, such as Vivonex T.E.N.; initiate and monitor tube feedings or total parenteral nutrition as prescribed Avoid serving rare meats and raw vegetables, which may harbor living microbes Monitor daily weight and laboratory values\u2014including serum protein, albumin, blood urea nitrogen, hemoglobin, and serum electrolyte levels and hematocrit\u2014to evaluate nutrition Provide mouth care, using viscous oral lidocaine (Xylocaine) before meals to relieve mouth, pha- ryngeal, and esophageal pain; use saline rinses after meals to prevent exacerbation of infection Perform skin care Use pressure-relieving devices (convoluted foam mattress, pressure mattress, or pressure pads), and turn the patient every 2 hours to prevent skin deterioration caused by pressure and inadequate circulation Apply A + D Original Ointment or other skin barrier to the perianal area to prevent further mac- eration of the anal mucosa Maintain wound and skin precautions to prevent further spread of infection Prevent and control infection Med-Surg_Chap17.indd 309 Med-Surg_Chap17.indd 309 8/2/2011 3:10:09 PM 8/2/2011 3:10:09 PM310 Immune system disorders The following chart summarizes the clinical signs and symptoms and treatments of major indicator diseases of acquired immunode ciency syndrome (AIDS).

loss of skin integrity is a potential source of infection Monitor antimicrobial therapies; antibiotics can increase the likelihood of superinfection and the development of resistant organisms Encourage and maintain adequate nutritional intake, which promotes healing and prevents infection Provide neuropsychiatric care Encourage the patient to discuss emotional issues; mood swings may be related to an inability to cope with the illness Identify resources for patient and family support Use reminder devices, such as pictures and appointment books, to help orient the patient Arrange for continuity of caregivers, and avoid frequent room changes to prevent patient confusion Consult occupational and physical therapists; the patient may need special devices, such as a cane or walker, and physical therapy to maintain or prevent further loss of function Promote health maintenance Teach the patient, family, signi cant others, and caregivers about the diagnosis, treatments, modes of transmission, and symptoms to report Explain medications to the patient, including dose, frequency, and adverse effects; reinforce the importance of compliance to help suppress the virus and to prevent the development of drug- resistant strainsDisease Clinical signs and symptoms Treatments Cryptococcosis High fever, headache, and malaise (early) Photophobia, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, and mental changes (late) Systemic therapy with amphotericin B or fl uconazole Neoplasms lesion impinges on organs or nerves Intralesional and systemic chemotherapy Cryotherapy Radiation therapy Biological response modi ers and antiret- rovirals Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Painless, enlarged lymph node, usually in the neck (early) Fever, night sweats, and weight loss (late) ChemotherapyAIDS indicator diseases (continued) Med-Surg_Chap17.indd 311 8/2/2011 3:10:09 PM 8/2/2011 3:10:09 PM312 Immune system disorders Discuss the importance of avoiding high-risk behaviors and reducing the risk of transmission to others Make appropriate referrals\u2014for example, for home care, pain management, legal services, support groups, nancial support, and hospice care Anaphylaxis /H18546Description Anaphylaxis is a clinical response to an immediate immunologic reaction between a speci c antigen and an antibody Its onset is sudden, dramatic, and characterized by rapid progression; in severe instances, it can be life-threatening because of vascular collapse and shock After the initial exposure to an antigen, the immune system produces speci c immunoglobulin (Ig) antibodies in the lymph nodes; helper T cells enhance the process The IgE antibodies then bind to membrane receptors located on mast cells and basophils After the body reencounters the antigen, the IgE antibodies, or cross-linked IgE receptors, recog- nize the antigen as foreign; this activates the release of powerful chemical mediators, which cause an increase in vascular permeability, bronchoconstriction, urticaria, and hypotension Substances that most commonly foods; certain cases have no identi able cause /H18546Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms range from mild to severe A mild reaction consists of peripheral tingling, a sensation of warmth, a feeling of fullness in the throat, pruritus, nasal congestion, and tearing; the reaction occurs within 2 hours of exposure A moderate reaction includes more pronounced fl ushing, warmth, anxiety, and itching A severe reaction typically occurs immediately after exposure Signs and symptoms include complaints of a feeling of impending doom or fright and a display of apprehension and restlessness The patient \"lump\" in his throat, has dif culty swallowing, and complains of chest tight- ness The reaction can progress to shock and cardiac arrest /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis is based on the patient's history and signs and symptoms Skin testing can identify a speci c allergen Treatment aims to control the patient's reaction A patent airway must be maintained, using endotracheal intubation or a tracheotomy, if necessary The patient may require immediate administration of epinephrine 1:1,000 aqueous solution, 0.3 to 0.5 mL given subcutaneously every 20 to 30 minutes for up to three doses, or 5 mL of a 1:10,000 solution given by slow I.V. infusion every 5 to 10 minutes as needed; if I.V. administration isn't possible, endo-tracheal or intraosseous administration may be used Drug treatment may also include corticosteroids, such as hydrocortisone, given I.V., I.M., or by mouth The patient may also need oxygen therapy and cardiovascular support with fl uids and pressors /H18546Nursing interventions Provide supplemental oxygen, and prepare to assist with insertion of an endotracheal tube, if necessary Insert a peripheral I.V. line and maintain patent I.V. access if necessary Continually reassure the patient, and explain all tests and treatments If the patient undergoes skin or scratch testing, monitor him for signs of a serious allergic response; keep emergency resuscitation equipment readily available Administer prescribed drugs; be aware that epinephrine is considered a rst-line agent inhaled agonists as ordered, typically 10 mg/hour via continuous nebulization or 25 mg every 15 to 20 minutes via nebulization Expect to administer oral antihistamines and steroids for 72 hours Monitor the patient's vital signs and respiratory status, and note his response to treatment If a speci c allergen is identi ed, teach the patient and family about the type of allergy or allergen responsible for the patient's signs and symptoms Teach the patient and family about the signs and symptoms of a reaction and the importance of car- rying and becoming familiar with an anaphylaxis kit; make sure they learn how to use the kit before the need arises, and teach them about the need for medical identi cation jewelry to identify the allergy Latex allergy /H18546Description Latex allergy is a type 1, IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction or type IV cell-mediated response to products that contain natural rubber latex It can cause reactions that range from local dermatitis to life-threatening anaphylaxis /H18546Signs and symptoms vascular permeability, tachycardia, urticaria, and pruritis may occur Other signs or symptoms include dif culty breathing and bronchospasm, wheezing, stridor, and angioedema /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis is based primarily on history and physical assessment of the patient Radioallergosorbent test shows IgE antibodies speci c to latex Patch test causes hives along with itching and redness The best treatment is prevention by avoiding exposure to airborne particles and use of latex-free products Drug therapy may include corticosteroids, antihistamines, and histamine-2-receptor antagonists before and after latex exposure For acute emergency, perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation, administer epinephrine, assist with tracheostomy, provide oxygen therapy, and administer volume expanders, I.V. vasopressors, and other drugs to reverse broncospasm /H18546Nursing interventions Make sure that products that aren't available free of latex are wrapped in cloth before they come in contact with the skin of a hypersensitive patient Use powder-free, vinyl gloves When adding medication to an I.V. bag, inject the drug through the spike port, and not the rubber latex port Urge the patient to wear a tag identifying his latex allergy Instruct the patient to avoid tomatoes, bananas, avocados, chestnuts, and kiwi fruits because they contain proteins similar to those present in rubber Teach the patient to be aware of all latex-containing products and to use vinyl or silicone products instead Rheumatoid arthritis /H18546Description Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic, systemic infl ammatory disease that affects the small joints of the hands and wrists and the surrounding muscles, tendons, ligaments, and blood vessels; it may progress to other joints and body tissues, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, and skin This autoimmune disease has no known cause; it affects three times as many women as men between ages 30 and 50 and becomes more evident during the winter /H18546Signs and symptoms Edema and stiffness may affect one or more joints, symmetrically and bilaterally, especially on arising and in the morning Med-Surg_Chap17.indd 313 Med-Surg_Chap17.indd 313 8/2/2011 3:10:09 PM 8/2/2011 3:10:09 PM314 Immune system include malaise; fever; anemia; rheumatoid nodules joint deformity Rheumatoid arthritis may be associated with pericarditis and pneumonitis /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis is based on patient history, physical examination, and serologic blood tests, including rheumatoid factor, 80% of patients with a positive rheumatoid factors test have the disease Other diagnostic tests may include immunologic studies, synovial biopsy, X-rays, and magnetic reso- nance imaging Treatment aims to reduce infl ammation and maintain or increase joint mobility Affected joints are rested, and splints may be used to help maintain functional positions Physical therapy exercises are recommended to maintain joint motion A paraf n \"glove\" may be applied to the affected joints; the patient dips his hands into melted paraf- n to form a 1/8-thick glove, which draws blood to the areas to resolve the infl ammation Use of ice or cold compresses alternating with the paraf n glove reduces edema and infl ammation Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) slow the progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and decrease the risk of permanent damage to the joints and surrounding tissue; DMARDS include meth-otrexate, sulfasalazine (Azul dine), immune system; they include azathioprine (Azasan), and cyclosporine (Gengraf) Tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors, used to inhibit the infl ammatory given to prevent NSAID-induced gastric ulcers Gold compounds also may be prescribed to reduce infl ammation; opioid analgesics may be and hydroxychloroquine), immunosuppressants (such as azathioprine), and cytotoxic agents (such as methotrexate) may be used to decrease synovial infl ammation; and sulfasalazine may be used to reduce infl ammation in patients who have responded inadequately to salicylates or NSAIDs Surgical interventions include joint repair or prosthetic replacement and synovectomy (removal of the synovium) Lymphapheresis or plasmapheresis may be used for some patients /H18546Nursing interventions Explain the treatment regimen and the involvement of each member of the health care team to the patient Administer drugs as prescribed, and monitor for therapeutic and adverse reactions; drug therapy may need to be changed if adverse reactions are intolerable or therapeutic effects don't occur Monitor the patient for relief of pain, stiffness, and soreness; patients have periods of remission and \"fl are\" when symptoms increase Help the patient with self-care, including ROM exercises, splint application, and ambulatory aid use Provide modi ed utensils and equipment suggested by the occupational therapist to help conserve small-joint and muscle function Provide rest periods in the morning and evening, with the patient lying supine in bed to maintain strength while preventing fl exion contractures; teach the patient not to overexert Provide a quiet environment for nighttime sleep; patients with acute rheumatoid arthritis require 8 to 10 hours of sleep Discuss home maintenance activities recommended by the occupational therapist to ensure that the patient understands needed changes Prepare the patient for surgery if indicated Provide postoperative care appropriate for the compliance with treatments to achieve optimal results Teach the patient about medications and adverse effects, activity restrictions, rest periods, and relax- ation techniques Encourage the patient to verbalize concerns about body image and changes in quality of life Systemic lupus erythematosus /H18546Description Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease that causes skin, heart, lung, and kidney infl ammation It varies in severity from mild to rapidly progressing with multiple organ involvement Although its cause is unknown, SLE affects nine times as many women as men, primarily between ages 15 and 45; it's more common in Blacks and Asians than in Whites Discoid lupus is a less-severe form of SLE that chiefl y affects the skin, producing raised, red, scaly lesions on the face, shoulders, and upper back as well as hair loss /H18546Signs and symptoms Primary features include arthritis with synovitis, a characteristic butterfl y rash over the nose and cheeks (develops in 50% of patients), and photosensitivity Constitutional signs and symptoms of SLE include fever, malaise, weight loss, and extreme fatigue Other effects may include diffuse and patchy hair loss, seizures, psychosis, pleuritis, endocarditis, myocarditis, Raynaud's phenomenon, anemia, abdominal pain, menstrual irregularities, and lymph node enlargement throughout the body /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis may be based on patient history; physical examination; serologic studies, such as CBC, lupus erythematosus cell test; electrocardiography; chest X-ray; and kidney function studies Treatment typically calls for NSAIDs and corticosteroids to decrease infl ammation Other drugs\u2014such as immunosuppressants, cardiotonics, and antimalarials\u2014are prescribed based on the severity of the disease /H18546Nursing interventions Monitor vital signs to evaluate the extent of infl ammation Observe the patient for rash to help differentiate SLE from discoid lupus Monitor the patient for reports of arthritis, joint or chest pain, respiratory dif culties, and other symptoms; SLE symptoms vary among patients Monitor the patient for seizures, headaches, and vision disturbances; neurologic problems may accompany the disease Monitor the patient for numbness and tingling of the hands and feet; peripheral neuropathy may occur Monitor the degree of fatigue, color of skin and conjunctivae, and color of stools; anemia is common in patients with SLE Test urine and stool for occult bleeding, a possible adverse effect of prescribed medications Provide for rest periods to avoid fatigue; promote independence in activities of daily living to improve self-esteem Encourage the patient to express feelings about changes in body image and the chronic nature of the disease Teach the patient about family planning, genetic counseling, medications, the treatment plan, avoid- ance of sun exposure, and wearing protective clothing and sunscreen when outdoors Med-Surg_Chap17.indd 315 Med-Surg_Chap17.indd 315 8/2/2011 3:10:09 PM 8/2/2011 3:10:09 PM316 Immune system disorders Review questions 1. The nurse is preparing a female patient with SLE for discharge. Which instructions should the nurse include in the teaching plan? /H18540A. Exposure to sunlight will help control skin rashes. /H18540B. No activity limitations are necessary between fl are-ups. /H18540C. Monitor body temperature. /H18540D. Corticosteroids may be stopped when symptoms are relieved. Correct answer: C The patient should monitor her body temperature because fever can signal an exac- erbation and should be reported to the practitioner. Option A is incorrect because sunlight and other sources of ultraviolet light may exacerbate the disease. Option B is incorrect because fatigue can cause a fl are-up of SLE, and patients should be encouraged to pace activities and plan for rest periods. Corti- costeroids, Option D, must be gradually tapered because they can suppress the function of the adrenal gland. Abruptly stopping corticosteroids can cause adrenal insuf ciency, a potentially life-threatening situation. 2. A patient with rheumatoid arthritis has a history of long-term NSAID use and, consequently, has devel- oped peptic ulcer disease. To treat this condition, the nurse should Misoprostol, a synthetic analog of prosta- glandin, is used to treat and prevent NSAID-induced gastric ulcers. Cyanocobalamin (Option A) is used to treat vitamin B 12 de ciency. Ticlopidine (Option B) is an antiplatelet drug used to reduce the risk of stroke. Prednisone (Option C) is a glucocorticosteroid used to treat several infl ammatory disorders and may promote gastric ulcer development. 3. The nurse is providing care for a patient with AIDS and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. The patient is receiving aerosolized pentamidine isethionate (Nebu-Pent). What's the best evidence that the therapy is working? /H18540A. A sudden gain in lost body weight /H18540B. Whitening of lung elds on the chest X-ray /H18540C. Improved patient vitality and activity tolerance /H18540D. A febrile body temperature and development of leukocytosis Correct answer: C P. jiroveci pneumonia is a protozoal infection of the lungs. Pentamidine isethionate is one drug used to treat this infection. Because a common manifestation of the infection is activity intol-erance and loss of vitality, improvements in these areas suggest success of the therapy. Sudden weight gain (Option A), whitening of the lung elds on chest X-ray (Option B), and development of leukocytosis (Option D) aren't evidence of therapeutic success. 316 8/2/2011 3:10:09 PM 8/2/2011 3:10:09 PMReview questions 317 4. A patient with SLE who receives immunosuppressants develops a fever. The nurse should: /H18540A. administer prescribed antipyretics. /H18540B. place the patient in isolation. /H18540C. apply cooling measures immediately. /H18540D. help identify the cause. Correct answer: D Immunosuppressants impair the patient's immunocompetence and predispose the patient to infection. Fever is a sign of infection; therefore, it's important to discover the cause of the fever as soon as possible. Antipyretics (Option A) should be withheld until cultures have been obtained. Isola-tion (Option B) isn't indicated unless the absolute neutrophil count is less than 1,000/ mL. Cooling mea- sures (Option C) may be indicated, but they don't have priority over organism identi cation. 5. Which nding distinguishes rheumatoid arthritis from osteoarthritis and gouty arthritis? /H18540A. Crepitus with ROM /H18540B. Symmetry of joint involvement Elevated serum uric acid levels /H18540D. Dominance in weight-bearing joints Correct answer: B Rheumatoid arthritis is bilateral and symmetrical; by contrast, osteoarthritis and gouty arthritis are unilateral. Crepitus (Option A) is usually associated with osteoarthritis. Elevated serum uric acid levels (Option C) are common in patients with gouty arthritis; weight-bearing joint dominance (Option D), in those with osteoarthritis. 6. A patient is admitted with acute bronchitis. During the admission interview, he tells the nurse he's allergic to bananas. Based on this statement, he may also have an allergy to which drug or substance? /H18540A. allergic to certain cross-reactive foods-including apricots, avoca- dos, bananas, cherries, chestnuts, grapes, kiwis, passion fruit, peaches, and tomatoes-may also be allergic to latex. When exposed to latex, they may have an allergic response similar to the one these foods pro-duce. Patients with allergies to shell sh may be allergic to iodine-containing drugs (Option A). Hyper- sensitivity reactions to cephalosporins (Option B) are more common in patients with penicillin allergy. There's no link between food allergies and penicillin (Option C). 7. A patient with AIDS is prescribed zidovudine (Retrovir), 200 mg by mouth every 4 hours. When teaching the patient about this drug, the nurse should provide which instruction? /H18540A. \"Take hours around the clock.\" /H18540D. \"Take OTC drugs to treat minor adverse reactions.\" Correct answer: C To be effective, zidovudine must be taken every 4 hours around the clock. Food doesn't affect absorption of this drug, so the patient may take zidovudine either with food (Option A) or on an empty stomach (Option B). To avoid serious drug interactions, the patient should check with the physician before taking OTC medications (Option D).

In a patient who has HIV infection, the CD4+ level is measured to determine the: /H18540A. presence of opportunistic infections. /H18540B. level of the viral load. /H18540C. extent of immune system damage. /H18540D. resistance to antigens. Correct answer: C The CD4+ level in the blood of a patient with HIV infection is measured to determine the extent of damage to his immune system. Although the level does indicate his risk for developing an opportunistic infection, it doesn't identify speci c infections (Option A). Different diagnostic tests are used to determine the viral load level (Option B) and resistance to antigens (Option D). 9. A 36-year-old patient complains of fatigue, weight loss, and a low-grade fever. He also has pain in his ngers, elbows, and ankles. Which condition is suspected? /H18540A. Anemia /H18540B. Leukemia /H18540C. Rheumatic arthritis /H18540D. SLE Correct answer: C Fatigue, weight loss, and a low-grade fever are all early indications of many immune system diseases, including anemia (Option A), leukemia (Option B), and SLE (Option D). However, only rheumatic arthritis is associated with pain in the ngers, elbows, wrists, ankles, and knees. 10. Which WBCs are involved in releasing histamine involved in the release of histamine. The major function of eosinophils (Option B) is phagocytosis of antigen-antibody complexes that are formed in allergic reactions. Monocytes (Option C) and neutrophils (Option D) are predominately ear, and nose disordersEye, ear, and nose disorders 18 Introduction /H18546Disorders of the eye, ear, and nose can be particularly disruptive to activities of daily living (ADLs) /H18546Full visual function requires normal brain function, an intact retina, a clear lens, and normal intraocular pressure /H18546Common vision disorders result from alterations in acuity, trauma, and high intraocular pressure; patients with impaired vision are frightened and anxious and require special nursing care /H18546Hearing loss is a common disability that affects millions of people and causes signi cant alterations in ADLs; sclerotic disorders and vestibular dysfunction can be especially upsetting /H18546Although the nose is the primary organ of smell, nasal disorders can affect taste and the smooth pas- sage of air during respirations /H18546Nursing history The nurse asks the patient about his chief complaint A patient with an eye disorder may report having diplopia, visual fl oaters, iridescent vision, vision loss, eye pain, or photophobia The patient may also report decreased visual acuity or clarity, defects in color vision, and dif culty seeing at night A patient with an ear disorder may experience hearing loss, tinnitus, pain, discharge, or dizziness A patient with a nose disorder may experience nasal stuf ness, nasal discharge, or epistaxis The nurse then questions the patient about his present illness Ask the patient about his symptom, including when it started, associated symptoms, location, radiation, intensity, duration, frequency, and precipitating and alleviating factors Ask about the use of glasses or contact lenses Ask about the use of prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, herbal remedies, and vitamin and nutritional supplements The nurse asks about the medical history Question the patient about a history of allergies, hypertension, diabetes, cerebrovascular accident, multiple sclerosis, syphilis, human immunode ciency virus, or sleep apnea Ask about corrective eye surgery Ask the patient about previous ear problems or injuries, frequent colds, hay fever, headaches, nose or head trauma, and sinus trouble The nurse then assesses the family history Ask about a family history of eye disorders, such as cataracts, glaucoma, or blindness Question the patient about a family history of diabetes and hypertension Question the patient about a family history of eye, ear, and nose problems The nurse obtains a social history Ask about work, exercise, diet, use of recreational drugs and alcohol, and hobbies Also ask about stress, support systems, and coping mechanisms Question the patient about exposure to chemicals, fl ying debris, noise, fumes, or infectious agents; ask about the use of protective eyewear Ask the visually impaired patient how well he can manage ADLs 319 Med-Surg_Chap18.indd 319 Med-Surg_Chap18.indd 319 8/2/2011 3:18:41 PM320 Eye, ear, and nose disorders /H18546Physical assessment Nurse begins with inspection Observe the patient's eye movements and ability to focus Note the appearance of the eyelids, eyeballs, and lacrimal apparatus Examine the conjunctiva, sclera, iris, anterior chamber, and cornea Check both pupils for equality of size and shape, pupillary reaction to light, and accommodation Test visual acuity using a Snellen chart and near-vision chart Test extraocular muscles by assessing the corneal light refl ex and cardinal positions of gaze Examine intraocular structures using an ophthalmoscope Observe the ears for position and symmetry; inspect the auricles for lesions, nodules, or redness; check the ear canal for hair, foreign bodies, and cerumen Examine the auditory canal, tympanic membrane, and malleus with an otoscope Assess hearing using Weber's and Rinne's tests and pure tone audiometry Observe the nose for position, symmetry, swelling, deformity, and color; note any nasal discharge or fl aring Inspect the nasal cavity for septal deviation or perforation; examine the vestibule and turbinates for redness, softness, and discharge Assess the patient's sense of smell Examine the nostrils using a nasal speculum; note color, patency, and the presence of exudate Next, the nurse uses palpation Gently palpate the eyelids, noting any swelling or complaints of tenderness; eyeballs should feel equally rm, but not hard or rigid Palpate the lacrimal sac while observing the punctum for excessive tearing or drainage Palpate the mastoid area and ear for tenderness, redness, or warmth Palpate the nose for pain, tenderness, swelling, and deformity Palpate sinuses for tenderness Age-related macular degeneration /H18546Description Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is characterized by small clusters of yellowish debris (called drusen) beneath the retina When drusen are located in the macular area, they cause visual loss Central vision is most often affected Two types of AMD exist: dry type and wet type Dry type AMD is nonexudative and is responsible for 85% to 90% of cases; in this type of AMD, the outer layers of the retina slowly break down Wet type AMD is exudative and may have an abrupt onset; symptoms result from the proliferation of abnormal vessels under the retina Although the cause of AMD is unknown, genetic factors may contribute to its development AMD is the most common cause of visual loss in people age 60 and older /H18546Signs and symptoms In dry type AMD, drusen can be seen beneath the retina; atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium also occurs In wet type AMD, the patient has subretinal fl uid accumulation or hemorrhage with a yellow-green discoloration that's sometimes surrounded by a pigment ring; in the advanced stage, exudates and brovascular scarring occur Grayness, haziness, or a blind spot may appear in the area of central vision; words may look blurred on a page, straight lines may appear to have kinks in them, and colors may seem dimmer The disorder may also cause dif culty with night vision and changing light conditions /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Indirect ophthalmoscopy may show changes in the macular region of the fundus The Amsler grid test may detect visual distortion retinal membranes, subretinal fl uid, and retinal thickening Although no known cure exists for dry type AMD, some evidence indicates that a diet high in beta- carotene, zinc, and vitamins A, C, and E may slow the progression of the disease For wet type AMD, treatment targets the development and progression of angiogenesis; laser treat- ments may be used Drug therapy may include a vascular endothelial growth factor antagonist the neovascular membranes Photodynamic therapy may also be helpful /H18546Nursing interventions Teach the patient and family about the disorder, including treatment and follow-up care Determine the extent of the patient's vision loss Help the patient obtain optical aids such as magni ers Assist the patient with adaptations to accommodate his vision changes; promote safety Encourage the patient to increase his consumption of vitamins A, C, and E as well as beta-carotene and zinc Urge the patient to use eye protection such as glasses or sunglasses that block ultraviolet light to pro- tect his eyes from ultraviolet light Offer emotional support Encourage the patient to express his fears and concerns, especially those related to vision loss and its impact on his ability to function Refer the patient to local support organizations as appropriate Cataracts /H18546Description Cataracts, which come in several forms, cause a loss of transparency of the lens of the eye or its capsule (See Types of cataracts ) It is a common cause of gradual vision loss that usually affects both eyes Type of cataract Description Complicated Develop as secondary effects in patients with uvetitis, glaucoma, retinitis pigmentosa, or retinal detachment or with systemic disease, such as diabetes, hypoparathyroidism, or atopic dermatitis; also develop after exposure to ionizing radiation or infrared rays Congenital Develop in utero at the anterior or posterior ocular pole; associated with heredity or maternal rubella infection in the rst trimester Senile Occur after age 50 as part of aging; the nuclear portion of the lens becomes increasingly dense, transparency decreases, and light rays strike the opaque lens and scatter Toxic Result from drug or chemical toxicity with dinitrophenol, ergot, naphthalene, or phenothiazines Traumatic Can occur at any age and are caused by mechanical trauma or exposure to chemicals, radiation, or toxic substances; the capsule ruptures, swelling occurs, and opacity increases; usually unilateralTypes of cataracts There are several forms of cataracts. They occur at various points in the life cycle, but the treatment for each is the same.

intracapsular extraction, which removes the entire lens in the capsule; or phacoemulsi ca- tion, which uses ultrasonic vibration to fragment the lens Corrective lenses may be prescribed to improve vision A plastic intraocular lens implant may be inserted in the eye as part of the surgical procedure Cataract glasses (glasses with magnifying lenses) or contact lenses may be prescribed 6 to 8 weeks after surgery /H18546Preoperative nursing interventions Explain the importance of compliance in a preadmission interview Make sure that someone can drive the patient to and from the day surgery center Tell the patient to tilt his head backward when shampooing to prevent jarring the eye and increasing intraocular pressure Administer a preoperative laxative to prevent straining during defecation, which increases intraocu- lar pressure Explain preoperative and postoperative care to decrease the patient's anxiety Answer questions and encourage the patient to discuss concerns /H18546Postoperative nursing interventions Review postoperative instructions to improve compliance and prevent complications; the patient may have dif culty reading instructions because of impaired vision Tell the patient not to bend, strain, lift, cough, sneeze, or rub the eye postoperatively; these actions can increase intraocular pressure, which can lead to complications, such as bleeding, vitreous herniation, vision loss, pain, and wound dehiscence; rubbing also increases the chance of infection Tell the patient not to make quick movements or read, which could irritate the patched eye or dis- lodge an implanted lens Teach the patient or family member how to administer eye medications properly; tell the patient to avoid using OTC eyedrops Teach the patient how to clean the eye to prevent infection Have the patient wear an eye shield and patch to protect the eye from injury; tell him to keep the eye patch dry and to wear an eye shield while sleeping Tell the patient to call the practitioner if any of these signs or symptoms occur: eye pain that isn't relieved with analgesics, yellow or green discharge, temperature above 100\u00b0 F (37.8\u00b0 C), blurred vision, nausea and vomiting, and seeing halos around lights Explain postoperative activity restrictions The patient may walk, climb stairs, watch television, and perform ADLs but should avoid engag- ing in strenuous physical activity and lifting more than 10 lb (4.5 kg) The patient may bathe or shower but should avoid getting water on the eye patch by tilting his head back when shampooing The patient should avoid bending from the waist and hanging the head forward; a long-handled grabber may be used to pick up objects Make sure the patient is cared for by a family member or friend after surgery Advise the patient to refrain from sexual activity until he receives his practitioner's approval Deviated nasal septum /H18546Description The nasal septum, which bisects the nasal cavity, is made up of cartilage and bone; deviations are common Med-Surg_Chap18.indd 322 Med-Surg_Chap18.indd deviation typically is asymptomatic, it can cause nasal obstruction and increase the risk of sinusitis and epistaxis Deviated nasal septum may be congenital or caused by trauma /H18546Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms of deviated septum include drying, crusting nasal discharge and other mucosal changes as well as bleeding that can block the sinus opening The patient may report shortness of breath and dif culty breathing through the nose; he may also report sinusitis and headache Upper respiratory tract infection, a blow to the nose, or nasal trauma can exacerbate symptoms /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis is based on visual inspection of the nasal mucosa with a bright light and nasal of to open the nasal airway and analgesics to relieve headache Long-term treatment may require septoplasty or submucous resection of the septum; in these proce- dures, the septum is surgically straightened and then stabilized with sutures and packing (consisting of petroleum jelly, iodoform, and soft gauze) for 24 to 48 hours Indications for surgery include nasal hemorrhage and an inability to pack the nose adequately because of deformity, recurrent sinusitis resulting from blocked sinus openings, and such signs and symptoms as snoring, breathing through the mouth, dry mouth, and shortness of breath Surgery is performed under local or general anesthesia and may require overnight hospitalization; its complications include and cosmetic interventions Determine the severity of the nasal airway obstruction; a patient with a blocked nasal airway needs humidi cation, oral hygiene, and other comfort measures Teach the patient about postoperative care to reduce anxiety and promote compliance /H18546Postoperative nursing interventions Keep the patient's head elevated 30 degrees to promote drainage, reduce edema, and maintain a pat- ent airway Check his vital signs and airway frequently to ensure that the packing hasn't slipped posteriorly, which could block the oral airway; take rectal, ear, or axillary temperatures while the packing is in place because the patient's only airway is his oral airway Watch for nasal bleeding and frequent swallowing; inspect the pharynx with a penlight if bleeding is suspected; keep emergency suction equipment at the patient's bedside Encourage the patient to expectorate oral secretions; record the amount and describe the secretions Change the 2 \u00d7 3 gauze dressing or drip pad, as needed, and record the frequency and amount of drainage Urge the patient to avoid swallowing blood, which can lead to nausea and vomiting Provide comfort measures, and administer analgesics, as needed, to decrease pain and promote par- ticipation in care Use a face tent to provide humidi ed air, and frequently perform oral hygiene measures; because air breathed in through the mouth isn't humidi ed like air breathed in through the nose, the oral mucous membranes can become dry Inform the patient of limitations and safety measures, such as not blowing his nose to prevent injury to the surgical site; if sneezing is necessary, the patient should open the mouth to release the pressure of the sneeze Tell the patient to notify the practitioner if signs or symptoms of infection, hemorrhage, or hematoma occur, including bleeding, pain, swelling, redness, fever, headache, or foul-smelling drainage Glaucoma /H18546Description This group of disorders is characterized by high intraocular pressure (IOP) and optic nerve damage that affects peripheral vision Med-Surg_Chap18.indd 323 Med-Surg_Chap18.indd 323 8/2/2011 3:18:41 PM 8/2/2011 3:18:41 PM324 Eye, ear, and nose disorders There are two main forms of glaucoma: Open-angle (also known as chronic, simple, or wide angle ) glaucoma begins insidiously and progresses slowly Angle-closure (also known as acute or narrow angle ) glaucoma occurs suddenly and can cause permanent vision loss in 48 to 72 hours /H18546Signs and symptoms Open-angle glaucoma may cause no symptoms, or it may cause a dull morning headache, mild ach- ing in the eyes, loss of peripheral vision, halos around lights, and reduced visual acuity (especially at night) that's uncorrected by glasses Angle-closure glaucoma causes the rapid onset of pain and pressure over the eye, blurred vision, decreased visual acuity, halos around lights, and nausea and vomiting /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Tonometry measurements reveal increased IOP; perimetry or visual eld tests measure loss of peripheral vision Ophthalmoscopy shows the effects of glaucoma on the optic disk (called cupping), whereas gonios- copy measures the angle of the anterior chamber of the eye Other diagnostic tests may include slit-lamp examination and fundus photography Drugs that may be used to treat glaucoma include topical adrenergic agonists, that reduce IOP by decreas-ing the production of aqueous humor Surgery or laser treatments may be peformed for patients who are unresponsive to drug therapy (see Procedures for glaucoma ) Bed rest is recommended for patients with acute angle-closure glaucoma /H18546Nursing interventions Encourage patient compliance by teaching the patient about the disease process and treatment Postoperatively, give medications, as ordered, to dilate the pupil and topical corticosteroids to rest the pupil and protect the affected eye Administer pain medication, antiemetics, and stool softeners, as ordered Encourage the patient to be ambulatory immediately after surgery Teach the patient to avoid activities that can increase IOP such as straining during bowel movements Argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) is a rst-line therapy for different types of glaucoma. It's used either instead of drug therapy or if drug therapy can't control the increased intra-ocular pressure (IOP). Performed as an outpatient procedure, ALT directs 40 to 80 laser beams into the trabecular network, creating holes through which the aqueous humor can re-turn to the venous circulation. For patients who are unresponsive to drug therapy or ALT, or aren't suitable candidates for these treatments, a trabeculectomy may be performed. In this glaucoma ltra- tion procedure, a fl ap of sclera is dissected free to expose the trabecular meshwork. This discrete tissue block is then removed, and a surgical hole is made in the periphery of the iris. The opening allows aqueous humor to fl ow out under the conjunctiva by creating a ltering bleb. Often, drugs such as 5-fl uorouracil are applied during or after the proce- dure to control scarring and reclosure of the hole. Patients for whom trabeculectomy has failed to maintain lower IOP or who are at high risk for failure may need a tube shunt implanted to keep the drainage pathway arti cially open. These shunts are surgically kept closed with an absorbable suture to allow healing time. Because of the time required before the shunt is operational and the dif culty of medically controlling IOP after surgery, the patient may undergo a trabeculectomy at the same time. Usually, this site fails about the same time as the shunt is healed, providing for continuous pressure reduction. When other treatments have failed to control IOP , trans- scleral cyclophotocoagulation may be performed. Between 20 and 40 laser beams are directed into the ciliary body of the eye to decrease its production of aqueous fl uid. Laser peripheral iridotomy is used to correct the narrow angle between the iris and the trabecular meshwork that blocks appropriate drainage of aqueous humor in patients with angle-closure glaucoma. A laser beam creates a small hole in the peripheral iris, allowing the fl uid to fl ow to the anterior chamber of the eye, which also results in opening of the angle of the eye.Procedures for glaucoma or chronic infl ammation of the external auditory canal Causes include water in the ear canal (swimmer's ear), trauma to the skin of the ear and resulting infection, vitamin de ciencies, and endocrine disorders such as diabetes mellitus Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas are the most common types of bacteria that cause otitis externa; Aspergillus is the most common fungus that causes the disorder Risk factors include swimming in contaminated water, cleaning the ear canal with cotton-tipped applicators, using ear phones or ear plugs, and chronic drainage from a perforated tympanic membrane /H18546Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms include mild to severe ear itching or pain that's aggravated by jaw motion, teeth clenching, opening the mouth, or chewing Other signs and symptoms include a feeling of the ear being plugged; a swollen, infl amed ear canal; foul-smelling, yellow-to-green ear discharge; thick, red and periauricular Fungal otitis externa may not produce any symptoms /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Microscopic examination reveals the causative organism Audiometric testing may reveal a partial hearing loss Otoscopy shows a swollen external ear canal, periauricular lymphadenopathy and, occasionally, regional cellulitis Treatment includes cleaning debris from the ear canal under direct visualization With mild, chronic otitis externa, the patient may need specially tted earplugs for showering or swimming Analgesics help control pain Other medications include If the patient has lymphadenopathy or a severe infection, he may need oral antibiotics Excision and abscess drainage is performed as needed /H18546Nursing interventions Clean and dry the patient's ear gently and thoroughly Use wet soaks on infected skin Give prescribed drugs; use a foam or gauze wick, as indicated, to administer otic medications To prevent recurrence, tell the patient to avoid potential irritants, such as hair care products and earrings Tell the patient to wear earplugs or to keep his head above water when swimming and to instill two or three drops of 42% acetic acid solution in 70% alcohol (diluted 50/50) into the ears after swimming to toughen the skin of the external ear canal Warn against cleaning the ears with cotton-tipped applicators or other objects Otitis media /H18546Description Otitis media is an infl ammation of the middle ear associated with fl uid accumulation; it most com- monly results from poorly functioning eustachian tubes The disorder may be acute, chronic, serous, or suppurative Acute otitis media occurs when a bacterial or viral infection of the fl uid of the middle ear occurs, which causes production of fl uid or pus Chronic otitis media occurs when the eustachian tube becomes blocked repeatedly due to allergies, multiple infections, ear trauma, or swelling of the adenoids Chronic serous otitis media is a middle ear infection with effusion without perforation Chronic suppurative otitis media is a perforated tympanic membrane with persistent drainage from the middle ear Med-Surg_Chap18.indd 325 Med-Surg_Chap18.indd 325 8/2/2011 3:18:41 PM 8/2/2011 3:18:41 PM326 Eye, ear, and nose disorders The pathogens that most commonly cause of the tympanic membrane, hearing loss, vertigo, men- ingitis, and septicemia /H18546Signs and symptoms Otitis media causes severe, deep, throbbing pain in the ear along with fever, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting The patient may also experience a sensation of fullness in the ear as well as popping or crackling sounds when swallowing or chewing Other signs and symptoms may include purulent discharge from the ear, evidence of hearing loss and, if tympanic membrane ruptures, pain that abruptly ceases /H18546Diagnosis and treatment The patient's history may include upper respiratory infection or allergies Otoscopic examination shows fl uid behind the tympanic membrane; in chronic otitis media, it reveals thickening or scarring of the tissue Culture and sensitivity testing of the exudate shows the causative organism A complete blood count shows leukocytosis (if acute otitis media results from bacteria) Radiographic studies demonstrate mastoid involvement In acute secretory otitis media, Valsalva's maneuver performed several times a day may be the only treatment required Treatment aims to eradicate the underlying cause-for instance, eliminating eustachian tube o bstruction Medications include antibiotics; rst-line agents include amoxicillin or, if the patient is allergic to penicillin, antipyrine/ benzocaine Surgical procedures include myringotomy and aspiration of middle ear fl uid, followed by insertion of a polyethylene tube into the tympanic membrane Other procedures may include myringoplasty, tympanoplasty, and mastoidectomy /H18546Nursing interventions Teach the patient and his family about the disorder, including treatment and follow-up care Administer analgesics, antipyretics, and antibiotics as ordered; institute measures to reduce fever Allow the patient and his family to verbalize their feelings and concerns; answer all questions and provide emotional support When appropriate, offer reassurance that hearing loss caused by serous otitis media is temporary Provide clear, concise explanations Prepare the patient and his family for possible surgery; provide appropriate postoperative care Teach the patient how to recognize upper respiratory tract infections, and encourage early treatment If appropriate, teach the patient to promote eustachian tube patency by performing Valsalva's maneuver several times a day, especially during airplane travel After tympanoplasty, advise the patient not to blow his nose or get his ear wet when bathing Otosclerosis /H18546Description Otosclerosis (or hardening of the ear) is an overgrowth of bone that impedes normal ossicular motion and can x the stapes to the oval window It's the most common cause of progressive conductive hearing loss in adults with normal tympanic membranes The disease has a familial tendency and usually occurs between ages 15 and 50; twice as many women are affected as men Pregnancy may trigger the onset in women Med-Surg_Chap18.indd 326 Med-Surg_Chap18.indd 326 8/2/2011 3:18:41 PM 8/2/2011 3:18:41 PMOtosclerosis 327 /H18546Signs and symptoms Progressive hearing loss, which may be unilateral at rst and may become bilateral, typically begins at an early age Vertigo also can occur The patient may report hearing his own voice better than the voices of others /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnostic tests may include audiometry; electronystagmography; and Romberg's tests; and facial nerve testing Hearing aids are recommended to improve hearing Stapedectomy (surgical removal of the stapes) may be done, and the stapes may be replaced by a prosthesis; complications of this procedure, which is typically performed under local anesthesia, include continued hearing loss, granuloma, oval window rupture that causes perilymph stula, infl am- mation, infection, prosthesis displacement, and temporary taste changes /H18546Preoperative nursing interventions Use alternative communication methods as needed; a patient with severe hearing loss may need written instructions or a signing oral interpreter Discuss preoperative tests and postoperative care to reduce anxiety and promote compliance Encourage the patient to discuss anxieties and expectations; clarify misconceptions, and inform him that his hearing won't improve until 6 weeks after surgery because of edema and packing /H18546Postoperative nursing interventions Elevate the head of the patient's bed 30 degrees; position him according to the practitioner's orders\u2014 on the unaffected side to prevent graft displacement or on the affected side to facilitate drainage Monitor vital signs, and check dressings for bleeding; attempt to quantify bleeding Check for headache, stiff neck, fever, and vertigo, which are signs and symptoms of complications Observe the patient for edema, meningitis, labyrinthitis, and infection Keep dressings intact; when removed, observe the site for bleeding, redness, drainage, and edema Clean the suture line as directed; use aseptic technique to prevent infection, and watch for signs of infection Keep packing intact; it's absorbable, and it shouldn't be removed Assess facial nerve functioning twice daily to detect nerve compromise Administer pain medications, as needed, to allow the patient to participate in care Help the patient get out of bed to prevent falls Remind the patient to avoid rapid head movements, which can cause the dizziness that commonly occurs after surgery Tell the patient not to blow his nose and to keep his mouth wide open when coughing or sneezing; Valsalva's maneuver can displace the graft over the oval window and could introduce bacteria to the middle ear by way of the eustachian tube /H18546Discharge nursing interventions Provide written instructions to increase compliance Tell the patient to avoid strenuous activity for 1 to 3 weeks but to return to work after 1 week as pre- scribed; strenuous activity can result in perilymph stula and may dislodge the prosthesis Instruct the patient to keep the ear dry for 6 weeks; he can shampoo his hair after 1 week; to avoid getting water in the affected ear while bathing, he should plug the ear with a cotton ball coated with petroleum jelly Tell the patient not to travel by air for 2 to 3 weeks to prevent barotrauma Tell the patient to avoid people with colds or upper respiratory tract infections for 4 to 6 weeks; these infections can spread to the middle ear by way of the eustachian tube Instruct the patient to report drainage, fever, otalgia (ear pain), vertigo, redness, and tenderness of the incision site Tell the patient to change the cotton ball covering the ear canal daily and as needed but not to disturb the packing in the ear canal Show the patient how to perform daily incision care Med-Surg_Chap18.indd 327 Med-Surg_Chap18.indd 327 8/2/2011 3:18:41 PM 8/2/2011 3:18:41 PM328 Eye, ear, and nose disorders Retinal detachment /H18546Description Retinal detachment is the separation of the sensory layers of the retina from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium; without treatment, the entire retina may detach, causing severe vision impairment and possible blindness It may be caused by degenerative changes in the retina or vitreous gel, intraocular infl ammation, or mechanical trauma In this disorder, vitreous body traction causes retinal tears or holes, which allow vitreous fl uid to leak behind the retina and cause it to separate Retinal detachment may be primary or secondary; a primary detachment occurs spontaneously due to a change in the retina or vitreous; a secondary detachment results from another problem, such as infl ammation or trauma /H18546Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms may occur slowly or suddenly They may include dark or irregular vitreous fl oaters, fl ashes of light, and progressive loss of vision in one area (as though a curtain is being pulled before the eye) /H18546Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis depends on ophthalmoscopy (both direct and indirect) after full pupil dilation; fl uorescein angiography, visual eld examination, and ultrasonography may also be useful Treatment requires bed rest, with the affected eye patched and the patient's head positioned so that the retinal hole is at the lowest point of the eye One of several types of surgery may be performed to nd and seal retinal holes or tears Diathermy uses extreme heat to seal the hole Laser photocoagulation uses laser-generated heat to injure the tissue and cause scars, which create a brous adhesion to seal the hole Cryotherapy uses nitrous oxide (also known as laughing gas) or carbon dioxide to injure the tissue by freezing it; the injury leaves a scar, which seals the retinal hole Scleral buckling places a band around the globe of the eye to bring the choroid into contact with the retina and hold it in place until adhesion occurs /H18546Preoperative nursing interventions Place the patient on bed rest, patch the eye as prescribed, and position the patient's head so that the retinal tear or hole is at the lowest point of the eye (if the detachment is toward the outer side of the head, have the patient lie on the affected side with the bed fl at); these interventions help prevent further detachment Provide emotional support to the patient who may be distraught at the potential loss of vision Prepare the patient for surgery by cleaning his face and giving him antibiotics and eyedrops, as ordered Teach the patient about the role of the retina and why fl oaters, fl ashes of light, and decreased vision occur Allow the patient and family to discuss their concerns Explain the preoperative routines and the surgical procedure /H18546Postoperative nursing interventions Position the patient as directed; the position varies according to the surgical procedure Tell the patient to avoid activities that increase IOP, such as sneezing, coughing, vomiting, lifting, straining during defecation, bending from the waist, and rapidly moving the head; increased IOP may cause more fl uid to fl ow behind the retina before healing is complete Administer eyedrops, antiemetics, analgesics, and antibiotics, as ordered; to reduce corneal edema and discomfort, apply ice packs as ordered Tell the patient to notify the practitioner if he experiences fl oaters, fl ashes of light, blurred vision, or pain that isn't relieved with analgesics; these symptoms indicate recurrence of detachment Teach the patient to recognize and report the signs and symptoms of infection, such as temperature above 100\u00b0 F (37.8\u00b0 C), yellow or green discharge, increased redness or pulling of the eye or lid, and vision loss Med-Surg_Chap18.indd 328 Med-Surg_Chap18.indd 328 8/2/2011 3:18:41 PM 8/2/2011 3:18:41 PMReview questions 329 Show the patient how to administer eye medications and change dressings using sterile technique to decrease the risk of infection Tell the patient to wear the eye shield at night or when napping to prevent accidental injury to the eye Discuss when the patient can return to work, resume ADLs, and drive or perform strenuous activities Review questions 1. The nurse is caring for a patient who underwent stapedectomy. To prevent postoperative complications, the nurse should instruct the patient to: /H18540A. sneeze with her mouth open. /H18540B. frequently blow her nose. /H18540C. clean her operated ear with a cotton-tipped applicator twice a day. /H18540D. resume bending and straining when she's no longer experiencing ear pain. Correct answer: A If sneezing can't be avoided, the patient should sneeze with her mouth open. This will prevent changes of air pressure in the middle ear, which can dislodge the prosthesis and graft. Option B is incorrect because blowing the nose and coughing should be avoided. Option C is incorrect because small objects, such as cotton-tipped applicators, shouldn't be inserted into the ear. Option D is incorrect because straining during a bowel movement and bending should be avoided for at least 2 to 3 weeks, or as instructed by the practitioner. 2. The nurse is assessing a 32-year-old patient with otosclerosis. The nurse should be aware that the patient's hearing loss: /H18540A. will resolve in 4 to 6 weeks without intervention. /H18540B. typically affects both ears. /H18540C. occurred suddenly. /H18540D. is associated with ear pain. Correct answer: B The hearing loss associated with otosclerosis is typically bilateral, although one ear may show a greater impairment. Option A is incorrect because otosclerosis is a progressive disorder that is not self-limiting. Option C isn't correct because otosclerosis develops slowly over time. Because oto-sclerosis doesn't cause ear pain, Option D is incorrect. 3. The nurse is teaching a patient with a detached retina who underwent scleral buckling on the left eye. The procedure included gas injection into the vitreous. Which of the following statements indicates that the patient understands the nurse's instructions? /H18540A. \"I should lie on my abdomen with my head turned to the right.\" /H18540B. \"I'll lie face down with my head turned to the left.\" /H18540C. \"I'll lie face up with my head turned to the right.\" /H18540D. \"I should lie on my back with my head turned to the left.\" Correct answer: B In a scleral buckling, the sclera is fl attened against the retina. A piece of silicone is attached to the sclera with a band that encircles the eye to keep the retina in contact with the choroid and sclera. Air or other gases may be injected into the vitreous to fl oat up against the retina and promote retinal reattachment. When a gas is used, the patient is positioned on his abdomen with the head turned to the affected eye (in this situation, the left side) so that the gas will fl oat up against the retina and aid in reattachment. The positions in Options A, C, and D don't allow the gas to fl oat up against the retina. 3:18:41 PM 8/2/2011 3:18:41 PM330 Eye, ear, and nose disorders 4. The nurse is providing care for a patient following right cataract removal surgery. In which position should the nurse place the patient? /H18540A. answer: C Positioning the patient on his back or inoperative side prevents pressure on the operative eye. Right side-lying (Option A) or prone position (Option B) may put external pressure on the affected eye. Trendelenburg's position (Option D) may increase intraocular pressure. 5. Which position would be the most appropriate for a patient who has undergone stapedectomy? /H18540A. On the affected side /H18540B. On the unaffected side /H18540C. Prone /H18540D. Sims' Correct answer: B The patient should be positioned on his unaffected side, with the operative ear up. He shouldn't be placed on the affected side (Option A) or prone (Option C). Although Sims' posi-tion (Option D) is a side-lying position, it doesn't take into consideration which side is best for after ear surgery. 6. Which symptom would occur in a patient with a detached retina? /H18540A. Flashing lights and fl Ptosis Correct answer: A Signs and symptoms of retinal detachment include abrupt fl ashing lights, fl oat- ers, loss of peripheral vision (not central vision, as in Option C), and a sudden shadow or curtain in the vision. Occasionally, vision loss is gradual. Homonymous hemianopia (Option B) can occur in stroke and traumatic brain injuries. Ptosis (Option D) can result from a stroke. 7. A 72-year-old patient is being discharged from same-day surgery after having a cataract removed from his right eye. Which discharge instruction should the nurse give the patient? /H18540A. \"Sleep on the as before.\" /H18540C. place pressure on the eyes.\" /H18540D. \"Wear an eye shield all day and remove it at night.\" Correct answer: C Rubbing or placing pressure on the eyes increases the risk of accidental injury to ocular structures. The nurse would caution against sleeping on the operative side\u2014not on the operative side (Option A)\u2014to reduce the risk of accidental injury to ocular structures. The nurse shouldn't tell the patient to resume all activities (Option B); activities such as lifting objects, straining, strenuous exercise, and sexual activity can increase IOP. An eye shield should be worn at night, not during the day (Option D); during waking hours, the patient should wear glasses or shaded lenses to protect the eye after the eye dressing has been removed. Med-Surg_Chap18.indd 330 Med-Surg_Chap18.indd 330 8/2/2011 3:18:41 PM 8/2/2011 3:18:41 PMReview questions 331 8. Which of the following increases a 40-year-old patient's risk of developing cataracts? /H18540A. A history of frequent streptococcal throat infections /H18540B. Maternal exposure to rubella during pregnancy Increased IOP Prolonged use of steroidal anti-infl D Prolonged use of steroidal anti-infl ammatory agents increases the risk of developing cataracts. The other risk factors don't contribute to the development of cataracts. 9. In caring for a patient after cataract surgery, the nurse should tell the patient to notify his physician of which of the following conditions? /H18540A. Blurred vision /H18540B. Eye pain /H18540C. Glare /H18540D. Itching Correct answer: B The patient shouldn't experience pain after cataract surgery; pain may indicate hyphema, or clouding in the anterior chamber, and infection. The patient might normally experience the other symptoms after cataract surgery. 10. When assessing a patient with glaucoma, the nurse would expect which of the following ndings? /H18540A. Complaints of double vision /H18540B. Complaints of halos around lights /H18540C. An IOP of 15 mm Hg /H18540D. A soft globe on palpation Correct answer: B Complaints of halos around lights is a common nding in a patient with glaucoma. Glaucoma doesn't cause double vision (Option A) or a soft globe on palpation (Option D). In addition to halos around lights, signs and symptoms can include loss of peripheral vision or blind spots, reddened sclera, rm globe, decreased accommodation, and occasional eye pain; patients may also be asymptom- atic. An IOP of 15 mm Hg (Option C) is within the normal range of 10 to 21 mm Hg.

it includes assessing the patient's understanding of the surgery, previous surgical experiences, speci c concerns or feelings about the surgery, and religious beliefs that may affect anxiety Determine the patient's language, his communication patterns, and the presence of any mental impairments, and arrange for assistance as needed /H18546Health history Obtain a history of allergies, such as to drugs, adhesive tape, latex, betadine, or soap Ask about preexisting illness, such as liver, respiratory, renal, cardiac, bowel, endocrine, and blood disease Ask about implanted prosthetics, pacemakers, and body jewelry, which may affect the use of electro- cautery equipment Inquire about use of medications, herbal or over-the-counter remedies, tobacco, alcohol, or drugs that could interfere with anesthesia or contribute to postoperative complications Ask about the patient's level of pain or discomfort and expectations about postoperative pain relief; perform a baseline pain assessment Ask about the patient's surgical history, including unusual reactions to anesthesia and postoperative nausea and vomiting /H18546Physical assessment Assess the cardiovascular, pulmonary, GI, and neurologic systems for baseline functioning See that a chest X-ray is performed, if ordered, to detect lung disease If the patient is age 40 or older, obtain an electrocardiogram to provide a baseline and detect arrhythmias Obtain a blood sample for a complete blood count and electrolyte levels as a baseline; if the patient is undergoing major surgery that may involve considerable blood loss, draw blood for typing and cross-matching Review the results of liver function tests, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and urinalysis to determine postoperative risk factors Obtain baseline objective data, beginning with vital signs, height, and weight, and then check for the presence of dentures or caps; also check for skin lesions, rashes, or pressure areas to report to operating room staff members to help prevent further skin breakdown If the patient is a woman of childbearing age, determine her pregnancy status using urine or teaching Provide a description of and reasons for preoperative tests, description of preoperative routines, time of surgery, probable length of surgery, and estimated amount of time in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) Advise the patient to refrain from smoking and consuming alcohol for 48 hours before surgery Explain the recovery process, including the place where the patient will awaken, nursing care pro- vided, monitoring of vital signs, equipment used, and the time he'll return to the room Cover the probable postoperative course, anticipated treatments, need to increase activity as soon as possible, need to cough and deep-breathe despite discomfort, pain medication administration, and anticipated discharge needs Explain the need for nothing-by-mouth status for at least 6 hours before surgery; explain which of the patient's usual medications, if any, will be given before surgery Explain any special procedures that must be performed before surgery, such as bowel preparation, cleaning with antimicrobial cleaners, and hair removal; hair should be removed with clippers or depila-tory cream shaving\u2014not by shaving\u2014to reduce the risk of infection Tell family members what time the patient will leave for surgery, where they can wait during surgery, when the practitioner will contact them about surgery results, and when they can visit with the patient /H18546Preanesthesia medication Preanesthesia medication is usually given while the patient is in the holding area to decrease anxiety, provide sedation, induce amnesia, prevent infection, decrease pharyngeal secretions, slow hydrochloric acid production, and prevent allergic reactions to anesthetics /H18546Informed consent Informed consent must be obtained by the practitioner before the patient receives his preanesthesia medication and should be placed in the chart The informed consent document indicates the speci c procedure to be performed; includes a list of possible complications, dis gurement, disability, and removal of body parts; is clearly worded in sim- ple terms; and contains the patient's or guardian's signature /H18546Preoperative checklist On the preoperative checklist, the nurse documents actions, such as removing jewelry and dentures, checking patient identi cation, verifying the surgical site, asking the patient to void, ensuring that all needed documents are available, and administering medications as prescribed If ordered, prophylactic antibiotics are to be given within one hour of surgical incision Intraoperative phase /H18546Description The intraoperative phase begins when the patient is transferred to the operating table and ends when he's transferred to the PACU or recovery room Universal protocol is required to prevent wrong site, wrong procedure, and wrong patient surgical errors Various types of anesthesia and anesthetics may be used (see Types of anesthesia, page 334) Postoperative phase /H18546Description The postoperative phase begins when the surgery is complete and ends with a follow-up evaluation in the clinical setting or at home PACU nurses provide initial assessment, care, and treatments while the patient recovers from the anesthesia; when the patient's activity level, respirations, blood pressure, level of consciousness (LOC), and oxygen saturation are stable, per PACU discharge criteria, he's returned to the regular unit /H18546Basic nursing actions Verify the patient's identity, position him properly in bed, and obtain the report from the PACU nurse Assess the patient's airway, respirations, and lung sounds; administer oxygen if ordered; a patient with a history of coronary artery disease should receive oxygen continuously until he's mobile Med-Surg_Chap19.indd 333 Med-Surg_Chap19.indd 333 8/2/2011 3:21:18 PM 8/2/2011 3:21:18 nursing the if the patient can't maintain an arterial oxygen saturation greater than 90% or a partial pressure of arterial oxygen greater than 80 mm Hg Obtain baseline vital signs and blood pressure, and assess apical and peripheral pulsations, skin tem- perature and color, and capillary re ll Assess the patient's LOC and neuromotor function;

obtain a home health referral if needed Provide psychosocial support; refer the patient for inpatient pastoral or social services assistance as needed; refer him to outpatient support groups or servicesA patient may receive general, regional, or local anesthesia. Type of anesthesia Description General Blocks awareness centers in the brain Produces unconsciousness, body relaxation, and loss of sensation Is administered by inhalation or I.V. infusion Regional Inhibits excitatory processes in nerve endings or bers Provides analgesia over a speci c body area Doesn't produce unconsciousness Is administered by nerve block, I.V. regional block with tourniquet, spinal (intrathecal) block, or epidural block Local Blocks nerve impulse transmission at the site of action Provides analgesia over a limited area Doesn't produce unconsciousness Is administered topically or by following chart summarizes the causes of postoperative discomforts and related nursing interventions. Discomfort Cause Nursing interventions Vomiting Fluid or air accumulation in the stomach Stomach infl ation Food and fl uid ingestion before peristalsis returns Psychological factors Adverse drug reactions Pain Electrolyte imbalances Encourage the patient to lie quietly in bed. Administer antiemetics, as prescribed. Prevent aspiration of vomitus. Maintain an accurate record of fl uid intake and output. Maintain adequate hydration. Provide comfort measures. Abdominal distention Loss of normal peristalsis for 24 to 48 hours after surgery Swallowing air during recovery from anesthesia Have the patient turn in bed, ambulate as toler- ated, and perform leg exercises if able. Have the patient avoid hot or cold liquids when peristalsis is sluggish. Insert a rectal tube to stimulate lower colonic peristalsis and gas passage. Apply heat to the abdomen to expand gas and stimulate peristalsis. Insert a nasogastric tube to aspirate fl uid or gas. Administer an enema as prescribed. Hiccups Intermittent spasms of the diaphragm that may result from direct, indirect, or refl exive irritation of the phrenic nerve Have the patient rebreathe carbon dioxide at 5-minute intervals by inhaling and exhaling into a paper bag. Aspirate the patient's stomach if the hiccups are caused by gastric dilation. Request blockage of the phrenic nerve by using local in ltration. Administer a phenothiazine as prescribed. Constipation Local infl ammation, peritonitis, or abscess Weakness resulting from surgery Administer an enema as prescribed. Administer a stool softener, as prescribed, in the early postoperative phase. Encourage early ambulation. Increase fl uids phlebitis or thrombosis Description Femoral phlebitis or thrombosis usually occurs in patients who have undergone lower abdominal surgery and in those with peritonitis or a ruptured ulcer It may result from injury to the vein by tight straps on leg holders at the time of surgery, pressure from a blanket roll under the knees, or concentration of blood caused by loss of fl uid or dehydration (see Chapter 7, Cardiovascular disorders, for details) /H18546Hemorrhage Description Hemorrhage after an operation may be caused by anesthetic interventions or internal bleeding due to surgical manipulation It's classi ed as primary, intermediary, or secondary Med-Surg_Chap19.indd nursing Primary hemorrhage occurs at the time of the operation Intermediary hemorrhage occurs within the rst few hours after the operation as a result of the return of normal blood pressure and its effect on clots in untied vessels Secondary hemorrhage occurs some time after the operation as a result of insecure taping or ero- sion of a vessel by a drainage tube Signs and symptoms A patient with hemorrhage may experience apprehensiveness, restlessness, agitation, thirst, tin- nitus, and progressive weakness followed by cold, moist, pale skin and pallid lips and conjunctivae; increased pulse rate; reduced blood pressure; decreased temperature; rapid, deep respirations; and a rapid decrease in hemoglobin level Nursing interventions Apply pressure to the area of bleeding, if accessible Provide supplemental oxygen, and maintain a patent airway Monitor the patient's vital signs frequently Give blood transfusions, I.V. fl uids, and drugs to hemodynamically stabilize the patient's condition Prepare the patient for surgery, if necessary /H18546Paralytic ileus Description Paralytic ileus is a physiologic form of intestinal obstruction that can develop after abdominal sur- gery, after anesthesia, after manipulation of the GI tract, or because of the stress response; it usually resolves spontaneously in 2 to 3 days Signs and symptoms A patient with paralytic ileus may have severe abdominal distention, extreme distress and, possi- bly, vomiting with diminished or absent bowel sounds The patient may be severely constipated or may pass fl atus and small, liquid stools Nursing interventions Maintain nothing-by-mouth status until bowel sounds return Provide I.V. fl uids as ordered Encourage frequent position changes and ambulation; decreasing opioid use and chewing gum may help resolve ileus If paralytic ileus doesn't resolve, insert a nasogastric tube /H18546Pulmonary embolism Description An embolus is a foreign body, gas bubble, blood clot, or piece of tissue that travels in the bloodstream A pulmonary embolism occurs when an embolus is dislodged from its original site and is carried in the blood to the main pulmonary artery or one of the pulmonary branches (see Chapter 9, Respiratory disorders, for details) It's common in patients who have experienced trauma as well as in immobilized patients and elderly patients and is a serious complication /H18546Respiratory complications Description Respiratory complications are serious, and they're the most common postoperative problems; their incidence is higher in patients undergoing abdominal surgery The most common respiratory complications are atelectasis, bronchitis, bronchopneumonia, lobar pneumonia, and pleurisy Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms vary according to the cause of the respiratory complication but may include adventitious breath sounds, chest pain, cough, sputum muscle use, and decreased respiratory excursion Other ndings include changes in mentation, anxiety, diaphoresis, fatigue, tachycardia, and 8/2/2011 3:21:18 PM 8/2/2011 3:21:18 PMReview questions 337 Nursing interventions Monitor respiratory status, including breath sounds, pulse oximetry, respiratory rate and depth, skin color, use of accessory muscles, vital signs, and LOC Provide supplemental oxygen, and initiate continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation levels by pulse oximetry Obtain a chest X-ray, as ordered Provide chest physiotherapy, and encourage coughing, deep breathing, and use of incentive spi- rometry to mobilize and facilitate removal of secretions Reposition the patient frequently, and assist with ambulation Administer drugs, such as antibiotics and bronchodilators, as prescribed /H18546Shock Shock is the most serious postoperative complication Shock may be hypovolemic, cardiogenic, neurogenic, or septic (see chapter 6, Disruptions in homeo- stasis, for details) /H18546Wound dehiscence and evisceration Description Wound dehiscence may occur when the edges of the wound fail to join or separate after they seem to be healing normally Evisceration may occur if a portion of the viscera protrudes through the incision Dehiscence and evisceration are most likely to occur 6 to 7 days after surgery Factors that may contribute to dehiscence and evisceration include poor nutrition, diabetes, chronic pulmonary or cardiac disease, localized wound infection, and stress on the incision Stress on the incision from coughing or vomiting may cause abdominal distention or severe stretching, leading to dehiscence Nursing interventions If dehiscence or evisceration occurs, take the following steps: Place sterile dressings soaked in normal saline over exposed viscera Monitor vital signs and report any signs of shock Place the patient on bed rest, and notify the surgeon immediately Don't allow the patient to have anything by mouth; he may need to have surgery /H18546Wound infection Description Infections of the surgical wound account for 38% of postoperative infections (see Chapter 5, Prin- ciples of wound care) Review questions 1. A patient undergoes a surgical procedure that requires the use of general anesthesia. Following general anesthesia, the patient is most at risk /H18540A. A Atelectasis occurs when the postoperative patient fails to move, cough, and breath deeply. With good nursing care, this is an avoidable complication. Anemia (Option B) is a rare complica-tion that usually occurs in patients who lose a signi cant amount of blood or continue bleeding postop- eratively. Fluid shifts that occur postoperatively may result in dehydration (Option C) and peripheral edema (Option D), but the patient is most at risk for atelectasis. Med-Surg_Chap19.indd nursing 2. The nurse is administering preoperative medication to a patient going to the operating room for an aortobi- femoral bypass. After administering preoperative medication to the patient, the nurse should: /H18540A. allow him to walk to the bathroom unassisted. /H18540B. place the bed in low position with the side rails up. /H18540C. tell him that he'll be asleep before he leaves for surgery. /H18540D. take his vital signs. Correct answer: B When the preoperative medication is given, the bed should be placed in low posi- tion, with the side rails raised. The patient should void before the preoperative medication is given\u2014not after. Option A is incorrect because the patient shouldn't get up without assistance. The patient may not be asleep (Option C), but he may be drowsy. Vital signs (Option D) should be taken before the preopera-tive medication is given. 3. The nurse is caring for a patient who was given pain medication before leaving the PACU. Upon returning to her room, the patient states that she is experiencing pain and requests more pain medication. Which is the best action for the nurse to take? /H18540A. Tell the patient that she must wait 4 hours for more pain medication. /H18540B. Give one-half of the ordered as-needed dose. /H18540C. Document the patient's pain. /H18540D. Notify the practitioner that the patient is continuing to experience pain. Correct answer: D The practitioner should be noti ed of the patient's complaint so that new medica- tion orders can be established. A patient who's experiencing pain after surgery shouldn't have to wait 4 hours for pain relief (Option A). A nurse can't alter a dose without rst consulting the practitioner (Option B); if she does, she could be charged with practicing medicine without a license. The patient's pain should be documented (Option C); however, the nurse also needs to follow up with the patient about it. 4. The nurse is evaluating a patient postoperatively for infection. Which of the following would be most indic- ative of infection? /H18540A. The presence of an indwelling catheter /H18540B. A rectal temperature of 100\u00b0 F (37.8\u00b0 C) /H18540C. Redness, warmth, and tenderness in the incision area /H18540D. A white blood cell (WBC) count of 8,000/ mL Correct answer: C Redness, warmth, and tenderness in the incision area would lead the nurse to sus- pect a postoperative infection. The presence of any invasive device (Option A) predisposes a patient to infection but alone doesn't indicate infection. A rectal temperature of 100\u00b0 F (Option B) is normal in a postoperative patient because of the infl ammatory process. Because a normal WBC count ranges from 4,000 to 10,000/ mL, Option D is incorrect. 5. The nurse is caring for a patient with a postoperative wound evisceration. Which action should the nurse perform rst? /H18540A. Explain to the patient what is happening, and provide support. /H18540B. Cover the protruding organs with sterile gauze moistened with sterile saline solution. /H18540C. Push the protruding organs back into the abdominal cavity. /H18540D. Ask the patient to drink as much fl uid as possible. Med-Surg_Chap19.indd 338 Med-Surg_Chap19.indd 338 8/2/2011 3:21:18 PMReview questions 339 Correct answer: B Immediately covering the wound with moistened gauze prevents the organs from drying. Both the gauze and the saline solution must be sterile to reduce the risk of infection. Explaining what is happening and providing support (Option A) may reduce the patient's anxiety but aren't the rst priorities. Option C is incorrect because pushing the organs back into the abdomen may tear or damage them; therefore, the nurse should avoid doing this. Option D is incorrect because evisceration requires emergency surgery, so the nurse should immediately place the patient on nothing-by-mouth status. 6. A patient in the postoperative phase of abdominal surgery is to advance his diet as tolerated. The patient has tolerated ice chips and a clear liquid diet. As the next step, the nurse would expect the patient to advance to: /H18540A. fl uid restriction. /H18540B. a full-liquid diet. /H18540C. a general diet. /H18540D. a soft diet. Correct answer: B After a clear liquid diet, which is nutritionally inadequate but minimally irritating to the stomach, a patient advances to a full-liquid diet next, which adds bland and protein foods. A soft diet (Option D) comes after that, which omits foods that are hard to chew or digest. A regular or general diet (Option C) has no limitations. Fluid restriction (Option A) is ordered in addition to the diet order for a patient in renal or congestive heart failure. 7. The patient's intake and output record contains the following information: milk, 180 mL; orange juice, 60 mL; one serving scrambled eggs; one slice toast; one can Ensure oral nutritional supplement, 240 mL; I.V. dextrose 5% in water at 100 mL/hour; 50 mL water after twice daily medications. Medications are given at 9:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. What is the patient's total intake for the 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. shift? /H18540A. 1,000 mL /H18540B. 1,250 mL /H18540C. 1,380 mL Correct answer: C The patient's total intake is 1,330 mL, based on the following equation: 180 + 60 + 240 + 800 + 50 = 1,330. 8. Which action is included in the principles of asepsis? /H18540A. Maintaining a sterile environment /H18540B. Keeping the environment as clean as possible /H18540C. Testing for microorganisms in the environment /H18540D. Cleaning an environment until it is free from germs Correct answer: B Asepsis is the process of avoiding contamination from outside sources by keeping the environment clean. A clean environment has a reduced number of microorganisms, but isn't neces-sarily sterile (the absence of all microorganisms) (Option A). Testing for microorganisms or culturing (Option C) isn't indicated for asepsis. Cleaning an environment until it is free from germs (Option D) would result in a sterile environment. Med-Surg_Chap19.indd 339 Med-Surg_Chap19.indd 339 8/2/2011 3:21:18 PM 8/2/2011 3:21:18 On the rst day after thoracotomy, the nurse's assessment of the patient reveals a temperature of 100\u00b0 F (37.8\u00b0 C), a heart rate of 96 beats/minute, blood pressure of 136/86 mm Hg, and shallow respirations of 24 breaths/minute, with rhonchi heard at the lung bases. The patient complains of incisional pain. Which nurs-ing action takes priority? /H18540A. Medicating the patient for pain /H18540B. Helping the patient out of bed /H18540C. Administering ibuprofen (Motrin) as ordered to reduce fever /H18540D. Encouraging the patient to cough and deep-breathe Correct answer: A Although all the interventions are incorporated in this patient's care plan, relieving pain and making the patient comfortable take priority. Doing so gives the patient the energy and stamina to achieve the other objectives. 10. Which intervention is most important to include in a nursing care plan for a patient with atelectasis? /H18540A. Give oxygen continuously at 3 L/minute. /H18540B. Have the patient cough and deep-breathe every 4 hours. /H18540C. Have the patient use an incentive spirometer every hour. /H18540D. Get the patient out of bed to a chair every day. Correct answer: C Incentive spirometry is used to prevent or treat atelectasis. Performed every hour, it produces deep inhalations that help open the collapsed alveoli. Giving oxygen (Option A) doesn't encourage deep inhalation. Coughing and deep breathing (Option B) is a good intervention but rarely results in as deep an inspiratory effort as incentive spirometry; it should also be performed more fre-quently than every 4 hours. Getting the patient out of bed to a chair (Option D) also helps expand the lungs and stimulate deep breathing, but it's not as important as incentive spirometry.

Med-Surg_BM.indd 344 Med-Surg_BM.indd 344 8/3/2011 7:25:11 PM 8/3/2011 7:25:11 PM345To provide appropriate care for a patient undergoing a diagnostic test, the nurse must understand the test and its uses, prepare the patient properly (including verifying that informed consent has been obtained and explaining the procedure), and monitor the patient carefully before and after the test. Test and description Uses of test Patient preparation Nursing implications Radiologic (X-ray) tests Abdominal fl at plate of abdomen or kidneys, ureters, and bladder X-ray of the abdomen or kid- neys, ureters, and bladder Detecting abdominal masses, bowel obstructions, ileus, or perforation Detecting renal and bladder masses and some renal calculi Have the patient remove clothing and metal objects. Instruct the patient to take a deep breath and hold it while the X-ray is taken. Cover the patient's reproduc- tive organs with a lead shield. Don't perform this test on a pregnant patient. Angiography X-ray of arterial blood vessels using contrast media (dye) Identifying femoral artery occlusion Detecting arterial peripheral vascular disease Checking for aneurysms, tumors, or vascular anomalies Determining status of cerebral circulation Determining condition of coronary arteries Identifying blood fl ow dynamics Instruct the patient to fast for 3 to 8 hours before the test. Mark peripheral pulses with a pen. Tell the patient to expect a warm, fl ushing sensation when the dye is injected. Check for allergies to shell- sh or iodine and for a prior reaction to dye before the X-ray. Observe the patient for signs of hemorrhage or hematoma at the insertion site. Monitor vital signs. Document the type of vascular closure device used and status of the dressing. Ambulate the patient per the standards for the type of closure device used. Check the peripheral pulses bilaterally. Compare color and tempera- ture in extremities. Monitor the patient for aller- gic reactions to the dye, such as diaphoresis, hypotension, wheezing, angioedema, and laryngospasm. Monitor the patient for signs of cerebral emboli, such as slurred speech, confusion, and hemiparesis (one-sided weak-ness). Encourage the patient to drink adequate fl uids.Nursing implications of diagnostic testsNursing implications of diagnostic Med-Surg_BM.indd 345 8/3/2011 7:25:11 PM 8/3/2011 7:25:11 PM346 Nursing implications of diagnostic tests Test and description Uses of test Patient preparation Nursing implications Radiologic (X-ray) tests (continued) Arthrography Visualization of the shape and integrity of a joint capsule following the injection of contrast media, air, or both Determining the cause of joint pain and swelling Diagnosing joint disorders and synovial cysts Tell the patient that crack- ling noises may be heard in the joint after the procedure due to the injection of air dur-ing the procedure. Explain that a local anes- thetic will be used. Assess the patient for allergies to contrast media or local anesthesia. After the test, assess the joint for swelling, and apply ice if needed. Administer an analgesic for pain and discomfort. Bone densitometry Measures bone mineral density Diagnosing osteoporosis and monitoring its progression Tell the patient to wear clothing that's easily removed from the hip area and without zippers or metal fasteners. Make sure the patient avoids calcium products for 24 hours before the test. Tell patient to remain still during the test. Cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography X-ray examination of coronary vessels using dye injected through a catheter in the femoral or antecubital vein (for right-sided cardiac catheterization) or in the femoral or brachial artery (for left-sided car-diac catheterization) Determining size and struc- ture of cardiac chambers Measuring pressures and volumes in cardiac chambers Determining valve structure and function Determining pressure in pulmonary vessels Determining extent of dam- age from heart disease Determining condition of coronary vessels Facilitating infusion of thrombolytic agents into occluded coronary arteries Performing angioplasty, atherectomy, and stent inser-tion Have the patient fast for 3 to 8 hours before the test. Prepare the patient for a warm, fl ushing sensation when the dye is injected. Scrub and clip hair around the catheter insertion site. If prescribed, administer pretest medications, such as an antihistamine, a steroid, a sedative, or a tranquilizer. Have the patient void before receiving the pretest medication or before going to the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Check for allergies to shell sh or iodine and for a prior reaction to dye before the test. Have the patient remove dentures and jewelry before the test. Start an I.V. infusion before the test and maintain it during and after the test. Obtain baseline vital signs, and monitor them continuously during the test and frequently after the test. Monitor peripheral pulses below the insertion site each time vital signs are taken. After the test, maintain pressure to the insertion site, and keep the extremity fl at and immobilized with a sandbag. Maintain bed rest for 4 to 6 hours and then ambulate the patient. Tell the patient to avoid heavy lifting and vigorous activity for several days unless the practitioner orders further restrictions. Check the catheter insertion site for hemorrhage or hematoma; apply ice if needed. Document the type of vascular closure device used and status of the dressing. Have emergency equipment avail- able to treat complications, such as arrhythmias, anaphylaxis, pneumo-thorax, and hemopericardium.

Instruct the patient to take a deep breath and hold it while the X-ray is taken. Cover the patient's reproductive organs with a lead shield. Don't perform this test on a preg- nant patient. Computed spiral CT scan Multidimensional visualization of a body part using a computer-controlled, focused X-ray beam of various speeds; contrast media may be used to enhance visualization Visualizing brain lesions, tumors, edema, and other con-ditions (cerebral CT scan) Identifying herniated disks, tumors, and other abnormali-ties (spinal CT scan) Visualizing tumors and chest lesions (thoracic CT scan) Visualizing liver, pancreas, spleen, gallbladder, reproduc-tive tract, and abdominal cavity for abnormalities (abdominal CT scan) Detecting kidney abnor- malities, such as tumors and calculi (renal CT scan) If dye is used, maintain nothing-by-mouth (NPO) sta-tus 3 to 8 hours before the test. If the patient is undergoing a cerebral CT scan, remove hair pins and jewelry, and adminis-ter a sedative, as prescribed. Explain that fl ushing or nau- sea may occur after injection of contrast media. Patients taking metformin (Glucophage) should be instructed to withhold medica-tion for 48 hours prior to the test and for a period of time after the test. Check for allergies to shell sh or iodine and for a prior reaction to dye before the test. Tell the patient to remain still during the test and breathe steadily. Prepare the patient for the large and con ning machinery; assess him for claustrophobia. If dye was used, check for signs of iodine reaction and acute renal failure after the test. If an allergic reaction occurs, administer an antihistamine as prescribed. Monitor for hypoglycemia or acido- sis in patients who withheld metformin prior to the test. Encourage the patient to drink fl uids after the test. Excretory urography X-ray visualization of the urinary tract using I.V. injected, iodine-based contrast media that concentrates in the urinary tract; also known as intravenous pyelography Determining the size, shape, and function of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder Detecting tumors, cysts, or renal calculi Detecting other renal dis- eases Detecting urinary outlet obstruction Maintain NPO status 8 to 12 hours before the test.

In the United States, it's the second leading health problem and the cause of one of every four deaths. Various risk factors for cancer have been identi ed: Tobacco is associated with cancers of the lung, mouth, tongue, upper airway, bladder, kidney, pancreas, and esophagus. Alcohol is associated with cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, and liver. Occupational exposure to carcinogens is associated with leukemia and cancers of the lung, skin, liver, bladder, nose, kidney, esophagus, and pancreas. Viruses are associated with cancers of the liver and cervix, Burkitt's lymphoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, and lymphoma. Radiation exposure is associated with leukemia, melanoma, and cancers of the lip, thyroid, lungs, breast, and digestive organs. Hormones are associated with endometrial and breast cancer. A high-fat, low- ber diet is associated with cancers of the colon, prostate, breast, esophagus, and stomach. In patients with cancer, normal cells go through a multistage process of change. During initiation, they're exposed to factors that damage them, causing mutation of their genetic codes. There are at least four types of genes that, when damaged, cause a normal cell to behave abnormally. These are oncogenes, tumor supressor genes, suicide genes, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-repair genes. During promotion, the mutated cells respond to additional factors that promote their growth. During invasion, continuous cellular division causes pressure and destruction of surrounding tissues by enzymes released from the cancer cells to promote the spread of disease. During metastasis, the cancer cells spread to other sites in the body that are far from the primary tumor site. Tumors are classi ed as benign or malignant. In benign tumors, cells grow abnormally but don't metasta- size or invade surrounding tissue. In malignant tumors, abnormal cells can spread, resulting in death for the host cells. Cancers are anatomically staged using the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) classi cation, which stages disease based on the size, penetration, and invasion of the primary tumor; the presence, extent, and location of regional node involvement; and the presence or absence of metastasis. Cancer also can be histologically graded as grade 1 (highly differentiated cells that resemble the tissue of origin most closely), 2 (intermediate differentiation), 3 (essentially undifferentiated cells), and 4 (highly undifferentiated, anaplastic cells). Patients with grade 4 disease have the poorest prognosis. Cancer treatment has four goals: Cure by eradicating the cancer to ensure long-term survival Control by arresting tumor growth Palliation by alleviating symptoms when the disease is beyond control Prophylaxis by providing treatment when the patient is at increased risk for tumor development, spread, or recurrence. Treatment may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, bone marrow transplantation, biotherapy, or any combination of these options.Nursing implications in oncology implications PM358 Nursing implications in oncology care Surgery For a patient with cancer, different types of surgery may be performed for different reasons. Diagnostic surgery is used to diagnose speci c types of cancer. Examples include laparotomy and inci- sional, excisional, aspiration, or needle biopsies. Staging surgery determines the extent of the disease and the need for additional therapy. Examples include exploratory surgery, tumor delineation, and multiple biopsies. De nitive and curative surgery removes as much of the tumor as possible. Examples include local excision of cancer in situ, cryosurgery, laser surgery, electrosurgery, and en bloc (in one piece) dissection. Preventive and prophylactic surgery is performed on tissues or organs at high risk for developing subse- quent cancer because of family history, congenital disposition, or underlying conditions. Examples include colectomy, orchiopexy, and oophorectomy. Reconstructive surgery is used to repair anatomic defects and improve function and appearance after can- cer surgery. Examples include ostomies, breast reconstruction, and prosthesis placement. Palliative surgery promotes patient comfort and quality of life by relieving the symptoms of advanced dis- ease. Examples include neurosurgical management of pain, removal of obstructive metastasis, and treatment of oncologic emergencies. Surgery to insert a mechanical device is performed to facilitate treatment or patient comfort. Devices may be inserted to facilitate drug administration, collect blood samples, or implant radioactive substances. Preoperative and postoperative care related to these types of surgery is similar to that for other types of surgery. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is the use of high-energy radiation in doses large enough to eradicate disease but small enough to miminize adverse effects. Radiation rays cause one or both strands of the DNA molecule to break, thereby preventing cellular division or replication. Rapidly dividing, well oxygenated, poorly differentiated cancer cells are most sensitive to the effects of radiation. Various types of radiation therapy may be used. With external beam therapy, the radiation source is out- side the body. With internal therapy (brachytherapy), the radiation source is placed directly on the body surface or near the body area to be irradiated. With interstitial therapy, the radiation source is implanted into the involved tissues. With systemic therapy, the radiation source is absorbed into the circulation and travels throughout the body. For internal, interstitial, or systemic radiation, safety guidelines include following safety procedures based on the type, dose, method, and half-life of the radioisotope and minimizing exposure to radiation by main-taining a safe distance and placing shields between people and radioisotope devices. Follow additional safety guidelines for interstitial radiation therapy with sealed (contained in seals, wires, or ribbons) or unsealed sources: Assign the patient to a private room, and mark the door with a radiation therapy safety sign. Assess the patient's self-care ability. Protect staff and the patient's family members from exposure to radiation by implementing time and distance restrictions, using shielding devices, and safely handling body fl uids, depending on the sealed or unsealed status of the radiation source. Keep a safety container in the patient's room. Prevent dislodgment of implanted radiation devices. Check linens, bedpans, and other equipment for signs of a dislodged implant. If the implant becomes dislodged, contact the radiation therapy department. Provide reassurance that when the radiation source is gone, the patient is no longer radioactive. care 359 Also follow additional safety guidelines for systemic radiation therapy: Wear protective gloves when handling the patient's radioactive body fl uids or items that come in con- tact with the patient's body fl uids. Use disposable food trays and eating utensils. Keep nondisposable items, linens, and other equipment in plastic bags in the patient's room to be scanned for radioactivity before removal. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is the use of antineoplastics to destroy or retard cancer cell growth. Chemotherapeutic drugs affect normal and cancer cells by interfering with DNA synthesis or cellular function during the cell cycle. They have the greatest effect on rapidly dividing cells, such as those found in bone marrow, mucous membranes, and hair follicles. The guiding principle of chemotherapy is to administer agents in doses large enough to eradicate disease but small enough to minimize adverse effects and the damage to the normal cells. Chemotherapeutic drugs are used as adjuvant therapy with either surgery or radiotherapy. Many classes of antineoplastics are used for chemotherapy. Alkylating agents are cell-cycle nonspeci c drugs that cross- link and break DNA strands, causing cell death. They're used to treat leukemias, ed as a heavy metal with alkylating properties. Antimetabolite agents are cell-cycle speci c for the S phase. They block or interfere with normal DNA or ribonucleic acid synthesis by competing for placement as a metabolite needed by the cell. They're used to treat leukemias, testicular and ovarian tumors, lymphomas, sarcomas, and lung nonspeci c drugs that interfere with DNA synthesis by inserting a compound between the DNA helix strands. They're used to treat Wilms' tumor, neuroblastoma, lymphomas, ovar-ian and testicular cancers, (Cerubidine). Vinca or plant alkaloids are cell-cycle speci c for the M phase. They block cell division by inhibiting spin- dle formation during mitosis. They're used to treat leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumor, and cancers of the lung, breast, and testes. Examples include vincristine, vin-blastine, and docetaxel (Taxotere). Topoisomerase I inhibitors cause DNA damage during DNA synthesis. They're used to treat colorectal cancer, metastatic ovarian cancer, and small-cell lung cancer. Examples include irinotecan (Camptosar) and topotecan (Hycamtin). Steroids and hormones, which are used in combination with other drugs, alter the environment that bathes the cell. They're used to treat leukemias, lymphomas, and organ tumors. available; paclitaxel, for example, inhibits microtubular function and is used to treat metastatic breast and ovarian cancer. Follow these safety guidelines when preparing, administering, or disposing of chemotherapeutic drugs: Prepare drugs under a laminar hood to prevent air from fl owing into your face (usually prepared by a pharmacist). Wear two pair of disposable gloves and a cuffed gown when mixing drugs. Perform hand hygiene before putting gloves on and after removing gloves. Don't eat, drink, smoke, or chew gum in the drug preparation area. If a chemotherapeutic drug touches the skin, wash the area thoroughly with nonabrasive soap and water as soon as care If a chemotherapeutic drug touches the eye, fl ood the eye immediately with clear water or eyewash and seek medical attention. Use spill kits for large spills on work areas or the fl oor. Don't store food or drink with chemotherapeutic drugs. Perform hand hygiene before and after administering drugs, and wear gloves. Don't dispose of materials by clipping needles, breaking syringes, or removing needles from syringes. Use needles, syringes, tubing, and connectors with luer-lock attachments. Use gauze pads when removing chemotherapy syringes and needles from injection ports or spikes from I.V. bags. Use an absorbent pad under the injection site to contain spillage. Avoid hand-to-eye and hand-to-mouth contact when handling chemotherapeutic drugs or contami- nated body fl uids. Dispose of equipment used to administer chemotherapeutic drugs in accordance with the regulations governing disposal of toxic and chemical wastes. Bone marrow transplantation Although bone marrow transplantation is a complex treatment with a high potential for severe complications, it has become a viable option for many patients with various malignant disorders. Bone marrow transplanta-tion may be considered for patients with various disorders, such as leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, neuroblastoma, metastatic breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and small-cell lung cancer. Before transplantation, the patient receives high and potentially lethal doses of radiation and chemother- apy that produce an immunosuppressed state and damage and destroy the patient's bone marrow, creating space for replacement with healthy donor marrow. There are three types of donor marrow: 1. Autologous donor marrow, the most commonly transplanted type, is harvested from the recipient during disease remission, processed, and kept in frozen storage to be reinfused at a later date. Peripheral blood stem cells can be similarly harvested by leukopheresis and are then processed and stored for later use. 2. Allogenic donor marrow is harvested from a relative or a person with similar human leukocyte antigen tissue type. 3. Synergic donor marrow is harvested from an identical twin.The donor marrow is usually infused 48 to 72 hours after the last dose of radiation or chemotherapy. Potential immediate adverse reactions include allergic response (urticaria, chills, fever), fl uid overload, and pulmonary system response to fat emboli. Potential complications include infection, hemorrhage, liver veno-occlusive disease, renal insuf ciency, GI disturbances, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and graft- versus-host disease. Nursing implications for care are based on the care plan for any severely immunosuppressed patient and include: prevention of exposure to nosocomial infections posttransplantation (strict aseptic techniques must be maintained) recognition of early signs of posttransplantation complications and graft rejection (early treatment may reverse the rejection process) provision of extensive patient and family teaching before and after transplantation recognition of the patient's and family's need for emotional support during the transplantation process. Biotherapy Biotherapy stimulates and enhances the body's immune response against tumor cells. Biotherapeutic drugs include bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccine, human tumor antigens, monoclocal antibodies such as rituximab (Rituxan), interferon, and Many biological response modi ers (BRMs) have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration since the mid-1980s. The following BRMs have had success in treating select cancers: Interferon is a protein that regulates the immune response and has antiviral and antiproliferative char- acteristics at the cellular level. Interferon is used to treat hairy cell leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia. Interferon also treats hairy cell leukemia plus malignant melanoma and follicular lymphoma. Interleukins are produced by leukocytes treats metastatic melanomas and cancers. prevents or treats thrombocyto-penia in non-myeloid cancers. Monoclonal antibodies may be tagged with radioisotopes for diagnostic testing or to kill target cancer cells; tositumomab (Bexxar) is used to treat B-cell lymphoma. Other monoclonal antibodies suppress autoimmune destruction of transplants or inhibit malignant cells (without radioactivity), such as ritux-imab (Rituxan) for for breast cancer. Colony-stimulating factors occur naturally in the body and mediate hematopoiesis. Filgrastim (Neupo- gen) and sargramostim (Leukine) are commonly used to stimulate white blood cell production; epoetin alfa (Epogen) is used to stimulate red blood cell production. Many adverse effects are associated with these treatments. Nursing implications include: familiarity with potential adverse effects and complications of BRMs careful monitoring and documentation of patient response to treatment extensive patient and family teaching. Cancer-related problems Various problems can result from cancer treatment or from the disease itself. To provide quality care, see the chart below for common cancer-related problems and their nursing implications. Cancer-related problem Nursing implications Alopecia To the patient, alopecia may be the most distressing adverse reac-tion. If caused by chemotherapy, alopecia is temporary. Radiation-induced alopecia, however, may be permanent. Prepare the patient for alopecia. Inform the patient that hair loss is usually gradual and may be reversible after treatment ends. Inform the patient that alopecia may be partial or complete and that it affects men and women. Inform the patient that alopecia may affect the scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes, and body hair. Discuss ways to improve self-image\u2014for example, by using wigs, hats, cosmetics, and scarves. Anemia Anemia can develop slowly over several courses of treatment or may be due to the disease. Assess the patient for dizziness, fatigue, pallor, and shortness of breath on minimal exertion. Monitor the patient's hematocrit, hemoglobin level, and red blood cell count. Remem- ber that a patient dehydrated from nausea, vomiting, or anorexia may exhibit a false- normal hematocrit. After this patient is rehydrated, the hematocrit will decrease. Be prepared to administer a blood transfusion to a symptomatic patient, as prescribed. Instruct the patient to rest frequently and to increase his dietary intake of iron-rich foods. Advise the patient to take a multivitamin with iron as oncology care Cancer-related problem Nursing implications Bone marrow suppression Bone marrow suppression is the most common and potentially serious adverse reaction to anti-neoplastics. Watch for the blood count nadir because that's when the patient is at greatest risk for the complications of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Plan a patient-teaching program about bone marrow suppression, including informa- tion about blood counts, potential infection sites, personal hygiene, and measures to take to prevent unnecessary exposure. Place the patient on neutropenic precautions according to institutional policy. Constipation Constipation is common in patients with colon cancer; it may indicate neurotoxicity caused by chemotherapy, or it may be caused by narcotic pain control. Assess the patient for bowel sounds, abdominal distention or pain, and fecal impaction. Encourage fl uid intake of 3 qt (2.8 L) daily unless contraindicated. Modify the diet to include more ber. Administer a laxative, stool softener, enema, or suppository, as prescribed. Monitor amount and number of stools. Depression Depression is described as a persis- tent sad or dysphoric mood. Assess the patient's psychosocial status. Encourage the patient to verbalize his concerns and needs. Offer to refer the patient to a cancer care counselor. Administer antidepressants, as prescribed. Diarrhea A common reaction to chemother- apy and radiation therapy, diarrhea can cause fl uid and electrolyte imbalances if severe. Monitor fl uid intake and output. Assess the patient for signs of dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Assess the patient for bowel sounds, abdominal cramps, and rectal irritation. Obtain stool cultures as prescribed. Administer an antidiarrheal as prescribed. Provide good perianal hygiene. Encourage fl uid intake, and modify the diet as needed. Dyspnea Dyspnea may result from lung cancer and is typically described as shortness of breath but also refers to dif cult or uncomfortable breathing. Assess the patient's breath sounds and pulse oximetry and watch for peripheral edema. Provide oxygen therapy if saturation levels fall below 92%, as ordered. Encourage the patient to pace activities with rest periods, and assist with daily activities as needed. Administer respiratory therapy as prescribed. Fatigue Fatigue is a general feeling of physical or emotional exhaustion and lack of energy that may result from anemia, decreased nutritional intake, or increased cell destruction by treatment. Assess the patient's ability to sleep or rest and level of fatigue. Assess the patient for signs of increased metabolic processes, such as fever and disease progression. Assist the patient with daily activities. Minimize physical fatigue by pacing activities and allowing adequate time for sleep and rest. Help the patient examine coping strategies. Leukopenia Leukopenia increases the patient's risk of infection, especially if the granulocyte count is under 1,000/mm 3. Provide information about good hygiene, and assess the patient frequently for signs and symptoms of infection. Teach the patient to recognize and report the signs and symptoms of infection, such as fever, cough, sore throat, or a burning sensation on urination. Teach the patient how and when to take his temperature. Caution the patient to avoid crowds and people with colds or the fl u during the nadir. Remember that the infl ammatory response may be decreased and the complications of leukopenia more dif cult to detect if the patient is receiving a corticosteroid. Administer colony-stimulating factors, as prescribed. in oncology care 363 Cancer-related problem Nursing implications Nausea and vomiting Nausea and vomiting can result from gastric mucosal irritation, chemical irritation of the central nervous system, or psychogenic factors that may be activated by sensations, suggestions, or anxiety related to chemotherapy. Control the chemical irritation by administering combinations of antiemetics as pre- scribed. Monitor the patient for signs and symptoms of aspiration because most antiemetics sedate. Control psychogenic factors by helping the patient perform relaxation techniques before chemotherapy to minimize feelings of isolation and anxiety. Encourage the patient to express feelings of anxiety. Encourage the patient to listen to music or to engage in relaxation exercises, meditation, or hypnosis to promote feelings of control and well-being. Adjust the drug administration time to meet the patient's needs. Some patients pre- fer treatments in the evening when they nd sedation comfortable. Patients who are employed may prefer their treatments on their days off. Sexual dysfunction Sexual dysfunction is a physical or emotional inability to express one-self sexually that can result from treatment or the disease. Assess the patient for sexual concerns related to fatigue, anemia, nausea, vomiting, or body image. If the patient is male, assess him for impotence; if the patient is female, assess her for menstrual problems. Give the patient information about the disease's effects and treatment. Discuss speci c measures to help the patient adapt to sexuality changes, such as using different positions and lubrication. Advise the patient that contraception is advisable during chemotherapy (or radiation therapy) to prevent birth defects from chromosomal damage. Allow the partner to visit the patient in private. Refer the patient to counselors or support groups, as needed. Stomatitis Although epithelial tissue damage can affect any mucous membrane, the most common site is the oral mucosa. Stomatitis is temporary and can range from mild and barely noticeable to severe and debilitating. (Debilitation may result from poor nutrition during acute stomatitis.) Initiate preventive mouth care before chemotherapy to provide comfort and decrease the severity of the stomatitis. Provide therapeutic mouth care, including topical antibiotics, if prescribed, and cessa- tion of mouthwash use. Encourage use of oral anesthetics before meals, pain medication, or both, if prescribed. Assess the need for diet change or alternate form of nutrition (tube feedings, total parenteral nutrition). Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia may occur with leukopenia. When the platelet count is under 50,000/mm 3, the patient is at risk for bleeding. When it's under 20,000/mm 3, the patient is at severe risk and may require a platelet transfusion. Assess the patient for bleeding gums, increased bruising or petechiae, hypermenorrhea, tarry stools, hematuria, and coffee-ground vomitus. Advise the patient to avoid cuts and bruises and to use a soft toothbrush and an electric razor. Instruct the patient to report sudden headaches, which could indicate potentially fatal intracranial bleeding. Instruct the patient to use a stool softener, as prescribed, to prevent colonic irritation and bleeding. Instruct the patient to avoid using a rectal thermometer and receiving I.M. injections to prevent bleeding.

Med-Surg_BM.indd 379 8/3/2011 7:25:13 PM 8/3/2011 7:25:13 PM380Common infectious disorders Disorder Characteristics Bacterial infections Anthrax Bacterial infection characterized as cutaneous, inhalational, or intestinal. Diagnosis con rmed by isolation of Bacillus anthracis from cultures of blood, skin, lesions, or sputum. Signs and symptoms directly related to the location of infection. Cutaneous anthrax is charac- terized by a small, elevated, itchy lesion, which develops into a vesicle and then a painless ulcer, along with enlarged lymph glands. Inhalational anthrax is characterized by fl ulike symptoms initially, followed by severe respiratory dif culty and shock. With intestinal anthrax, fever, nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite occur, which progress to abdominal pain, hematemesis, and severe diarrhea. Chlamydia Sexually transmitted infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis . Can cause urethritis and pelvic infl ammatory disease. Conjunctivitis Bacterial or viral infection of the conjunctiva of the eye. Culture from the conjunctiva identi es the causative organism. Associated with hyperemia of the eye, discharge, tearing, pain, and photophobia. Gonorrhea Sexually transmitted infection caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a gram-negative, oxidase- positive diplococcus. After exposure, epithelial cells at infection site become infected and the disease begins to spread locally. Disease pattern depends on the individual infected and the site of infection. Listeriosis Infection caused by weakly hemolytic, gram-positive bacillus Listeria monocytogenes . Primary method of is neonatal infection in utero or during pas- sage through an infected birth canal. Disease may cause abortion, premature delivery, stillbirth, or organ abscesses in fetuses. Neonates may have tense fontanels due to meningitis, be irritable or lethargic, have seizures, or be comatose. Lyme disease Infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi spirochetes. Transmitted by ixodid tick, which injects spirochete-laden saliva into the bloodstream or deposits fecal matter on the skin. After 3 to 32 days, spirochetes migrate outward, typically causing a ringlike rash, called ery- thema chronicum migrans . Spirochetes disseminate to other skin sites or organs through the bloodstream or lymphatic system. Spirochetes may survive for years in joints, or they may die after triggering an infl ammatory response in the host. As infection progresses through three stages, neurologic symptoms and impairment worsen.Common infectious disorders 8/3/2011 7:25:14 PM 8/3/2011 7:25:14 PMCommon Bacterial infections (continued) Meningitis Meningeal infl ammation caused by bacteria, viruses, protozoa, or fungi. The most common types are bacterial and viral. Disease occurs when infecting organisms enter the subarachnoid space and cause an infl am- matory response. The organisms gain access to the cerebrospinal fl uid, where they cause irrita- tion of the tissues bathed by the fl uid. Characteristic signs include fever, chills, headache, nuchal rigidity, vomiting, photophobia, lethargy, coma, positive Brudzinski's and Kernig's signs, increased deep tendon refl exes, pressure, bradycardia, and rash. Otitis media Infl ammation of the middle ear caused by a bacterial infection. Disease is commonly accompanied by a viral upper respiratory infection. Viral symptoms occur, generally followed by ear pain. Peritonitis Acute or chronic infl ammation of the peritoneum caused by bacterial invasion. Onset commonly sudden, with severe and diffuse abdominal pain. Pain intensi es and localizes in the region of infection. Pertussis (whooping cough) Highly contagious respiratory infection usually caused by the nonmotile, gram-negative coc- cobacillus Bordetella pertussis and, occasionally, by the related similar bacteria B. parapertussis or B. bronchiseptica . Transmitted by direct inhalation of contaminated droplets from a patient in an acute stage. It may also spread indirectly though soiled linen and other articles contaminated by respiratory secretions. After approximately 7 to 10 days, B. pertussis enters the tracheobronchial mucosa, where it produces progressively tenacious mucus. Known for its associated spasmodic cough, characteristically ending in a loud, crowing inspi- ratory whoop. Complications include apnea, hypoxia, seizures, pneumonia, encephalopathy, and death. Pneumonia Infection of the lung parenchyma that's bacterial, fungal, viral, or protozoal in origin. The lower respiratory tract can be exposed to pathogens by inhalation, aspiration, vascular dissemination, or direct contact with con taminated equipment. When inside, the pathogen begins to colonize and infection develops. Bacterial infection initially triggers alveolar infl ammation and edema, which produces an area of low ventilation with normal perfusion. Capillaries become engorged with blood, causing stasis. As alveolocapillary membranes break down, alveoli ll with blood and exudates, causing atelectasis, or lung collapse. Salmonellosis Disease caused by a serotype of the genus Salmonella, a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family. Most common species of Salmonella include S. typhi, which causes typhoid fever; S. enteritidis, which S. choleraesuis, which causes bacteremia. Nontyphoidal salmonellosis usually follows ingestion of contaminated dry milk, chocolate bars, pharmaceuticals of animal origin, or contaminated or inadequately processed foods, espe-cially eggs and poultry. Characteristic symptoms include fever, abdominal pain or cramps, and severe diarrhea with enterocolitis. Shigellosis Acute intestinal infection caused by the bacteria shigella, a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family. It's a short, nonmotile, gram-negative rod. Transmission occurs primarily through the fecal-oral route. After an incubation period of 1 to 4 days, shigella organisms invade the intestinal mucosa and cause infl ammation. Symptoms can range from watery stools to fever, cramps, and stools with pus, mucus, or blood. Med-Surg_BM.indd 381 Med-Surg_BM.indd 381 8/3/2011 7:25:14 PM 8/3/2011 7:25:14 PM382 Common infectious disorders Disorder Characteristics Bacterial infections (continued) Tetanus Acute exotoxin-mediated infection caused by the anaerobic, spore-forming, gram-positive bacil- lus Clostridium tetani . Transmission occurs through a puncture wound that's contaminated by soil, dust, or animal excreta containing C. tetani, or by way of burns and minor wounds. After C. tetani enters the body, it causes local infection and tissue necrosis. It also produces toxins that then enter the bloodstream and lymphatics and eventually spread to central nervous system (CNS) tissue. Disease is characterized by marked muscle hypertonicity, hyperactive deep tendon refl exes, and painful, involuntary muscle contractions. Severe muscle spasms can last up to 7 days. Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) Acute bacterial infection caused by toxin-producing, penicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococ- cus aureus, such as TSS toxin-1 or staphylococcal enterotoxins B and C. It can also be caused by Streptococcus pyogenes . Menstrual TSS is associated with tampon use. Nonmenstrual TSS is associated with infections, such as abscesses, osteomyelitis, pneumonia, endocarditis, bacteremia, and postsurgical infections. Signs and symptoms include fever, hypotension, renal failure, and multisystem involvement. Tuberculosis Infectious disease transmitted by inhaling Mycobacterium tuberculosis, an acid-fast bacillus, from an infected person. Bacilli are deposited in the lungs, the immune system responds by sending leukocytes, and infl ammation results. After a few days, leukocytes are replaced by macrophages. Bacilli are then ingested by the macrophages and carried off by the lymphatics to the lymph nodes. Macro-phages that ingest the bacilli fuse to form epithelioid cell tubercles, tiny nodules surrounded by lymphocytes. Caseous necrosis develops in the lesion, and scar tissue encapsulates the tubercle. The organ- ism may be killed in the process or exist in a dormant state. Dormant organisms may reactivate and cause local disease in the presence of immunosup- pression. Urinary tract infection Infection most commonly caused by enteric gram-negative bacilli. Results from microorganisms entering the urethra and then ascending into the bladder. Commonly causes urgency, frequency, and dysuria. Viral infections Cytomegalovirus infection A deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) virus that's a member of the herpes virus group. Transmission can occur horizontally (person-to-person contact with secretions), vertically (mother to neonate), or through blood transfusions. The virus spreads through the body in lymphocytes or mononuclear cells to the lungs, liver, GI tract, eyes, and CNS, where it commonly produces infl ammatory reactions, nocompromised (HSV) HSV is double-stranded DNA virus that causes both herpes simplex type 1 and type 2. Type 1 HSV is transmitted via oral and respiratory secretions; type 2 HSV is transmitted via sexual contact. During exposure, the virus fuses to the host cell membrane and releases proteins, turning off the host cell's protein production or synthesis. The virus then replicates and synthesizes struc-tural proteins. The virus pushes its nucleocapsid (protein coat and nucleic acid) into the cyto-plasm of the host cell and releases the viral DNA. Complete virus particles capable of surviving and infecting a living cell are transported to the cell's surface. Characteristic painful, vesicular lesions are usually observed at the site of initial infection. Herpes zoster Caused by a reactivation of varicella-zoster virus that has been lying dormant in the cerebral ganglia or the ganglia of posterior nerve roots. Small, painful, red, nodular skin lesions develop on areas along nerve paths. Lesions change to vesicles lled with pus or fl 7:25:14 PM 8/3/2011 7:25:14 PMCommon infectious disorders 383 Disorder Characteristics Viral infections (continued) Human immunode ciency virus (HIV) infectionA ribonucleic acid (RNA) retrovirus that causes acquired immunode ciency syndrome (AIDS). Virus passes from one person to another through blood-to-blood and sexual contact. In addi- tion, an infected pregnant woman can pass HIV to her baby during pregnancy or delivery as well as through breast-feeding. Most people with HIV infection develop AIDS; however, current combination drug therapy in conjunction with treatment and prophylaxis of common opportunistic infections can delay the natural progression and prolong survival. Infectious mononucleosis Viral illness caused by the Epstein-Barr virus, a B-lymphotropic herpes virus. Most cases spread by the oropharyngeal route, but transmission by blood transfusion or dur- ing cardiac surgery is also possible. The virus invades the B cells of the oropharyngeal lymphoid tissues and then replicates. Dying B cells release the virus into the blood, causing fever and other symptoms. During this period, antiviral antibodies appear and the virus disappears from the blood, lodging mainly in the parotid gland. Infl uenza A contagious respiratory illness caused by infl uenza viruses. Symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, and muscle aches. Virus could progress to eye infections, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress. Monkeypox Rare disease caused by the monkeypox virus, which belongs to the orthopoxvirus group. In humans, monkeypox causes swollen lymph nodes, fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, exhaustion, and a papular rash with lesions that eventually crust and fall off. Mumps Acute viral disease caused by an RNA virus classi ed as Rubulavirus in the Paramyxoviridae family. Virus is transmitted by droplets or by direct contact. Characterized by enlargement and tenderness of parotid gland and swelling of other salivary glands. Rabies Rapidly progressive infection of the CNS caused by an RNA virus in the Rhabdoviridae family. Transmitted by the bite of an infected animal through the skin or mucous membranes or, occasionally, in airborne droplets or infected tissue. The rabies virus begins replicating in the striated muscle cells at the bite site and then spreads along the nerve pathways to the spinal cord and brain, where it replicates again and causes a fatal encephalitis. Respiratory syncytial virus Infection of the respiratory tract caused by an enveloped RNA paramyxovirus. The organism is transmitted from person to person by respiratory secretions or by touching contaminated surfaces. Bronchiolitis or pneumonia ensues and, in severe cases, may damage the bronchiolar epithelium. Interalveolar thickening and lling of alveolar spaces with fl uid may occur. The virus is more common in winter and early spring. Rubella An enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus classi ed as a rubivirus in the Togaviridae family. Transmitted through contact with the blood, urine, stool, or nasopharyngeal secretions of an infected person. It can also be transmitted transplacentally. The virus replicates rst in the respiratory tract and then spreads through the bloodstream. Characteristic maculopapular rash usually begins on the face and then spreads rapidly. Rubeola (measles) Acute, highly contagious paramyxovirus infection that's spread by direct contact or by contami- nated airborne respiratory droplets. Portal of entry is the upper respiratory tract. Characterized by Koplik's spots (lesions on the buccal mucosa) and a pruritic macular rash that becomes papular and erythematous. Can be associated with encephalitis and 383 8/3/2011 7:25:14 PM 8/3/2011 7:25:14 PM384 Common infectious disorders Disorder Characteristics Viral infections (continued) Smallpox Acute contagious virus caused by the variola virus, a member of the Orthopoxvirus family. Transmitted from person to person by infected aerosols and air droplets. The incubation period, which is usually 12 to 14 days, is followed by the sudden onset of infl u- enzalike symptoms including fever, malaise, headache, and severe back pain. Between 2 and 3 days later, the patient may feel better; however, the characteristic rash appears, rst on the face, hands, and forearms and then after a few days progressing to the trunk. Lesions also develop in the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth, then ulcerate and release large amounts of virus into the mouth and throat. Varicella (chickenpox) Common, highly contagious exanthem caused by the varicella-zoster virus, a member of the herpes virus family. Transmitted by respiratory droplets or contact with vesicles. In utero infection is also possible. Characterized by a pruritic rash of small, erythematous macules that progresses to papules and then to clear vesicles on an erythematous base. Viral pneumonia Lung infection caused by any one of a variety of viruses, transmitted through contact with an infected individual. The virus rst attacks bronchiolar epithelial cells, causing interstitial infl ammation and desquamation. Virus invades bronchial mucous glands and goblet cells and then spreads to the alveoli, which ll with blood and fl uid. In advanced infection, a hyaline membrane may form. Fungal infections Histoplasmosis Fungal infection caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, a dimorphic fungus. Transmitted through inhalation of H. capsulatum spores or invasion of spores after minor skin trauma. Initially, infected person may be asymptomatic or have symptoms of mild respiratory illness, sometimes progressing into more severe illness affecting several organ systems. Protozoal infections Toxoplasmosis Infection caused by the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which affects both birds and mammals. Transmitted to humans by ingestion of tissue cysts in raw or undercooked meat or by fecal- oral contamination from infected cats. Direct transmission can also occur during blood transfu-sions, organ transplants, or bone marrow transplants. When tissue cysts are ingested, parasites are released, which quickly invade and multiply within the GI tract. The parasitic cells rupture the invaded host cell and then disseminate to the CNS, lymphatic tissue, skeletal muscle, myocardium, retina, and placenta. As the parasites replicate and invade adjoining cells, cell death and focal necrosis occur, sur- rounded by an acute infl ammatory response, which are the hallmarks of this infection. After the cysts reach maturity, the infl ammatory process is undetectable and the cysts remain latent within the brain until they rupture. In the normal host, the immune response checks the infection, but this isn't so with immuno- compromised or fetal hosts. In these patients, focal destruction results in necrotizing encephali-tis, pneumonia, myocarditis, and organ failure. Trichinosis Infection caused by the parasite Trichinella spiralis and transmitted through ingestion of uncooked or undercooked meat that contains encysted larvae. After gastric juices free the larva from the cyst capsule, it reaches sexual maturity in a few days. The female roundworm burrows into the intestinal mucosa and reproduces. Larvae then travel through the lymphatic system and the bloodstream. They become embed- ded as cysts in striated muscle, especially in the for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released these guidelines to improve adherence to hand hygiene in health care settings. Improved adherence to hand hygiene (that is, hand- washing or use of alcohol-based hand rubs) has been shown to terminate infection outbreaks in health care facilities, reduce transmission of antimicrobial-resistant organisms, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and reduce overall infection rates. In addition to traditional handwashing with soap and water, the CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand rubs by health care personnel for patient care because these products address some of the obstacles that health care professionals face when caring for patients. Handwashing with soap and water remains a sensible strategy for hand hygiene in non-health care settings and is recommended by the CDC and other experts. Health care personnel should wash with soap and water when their hands are visibly soiled. The use of gloves does not eliminate the need for hand hygiene. Likewise, the use of hand hygiene does not elimi-nate the need for gloves. Gloves reduce hand contamina-tion by 70% to 80%, prevent cross-contamination, and protect patients and health care personnel from infection. Hand rubs should be used before and after contact with each patient just as gloves should be changed before and after contact with each patient. When using an alcohol-based hand rub, the product should be applied to the palm of one hand. The hands and ngers should then be rubbed together, covering all sur- faces, until hands are dry. Note that the volume needed to reduce the number of bacteria on hands varies by product. Alcohol-based hand rubs signi cantly reduce the num- ber of microorganisms on the skin, are fast acting, and are less likely to cause skin irritation. Health care personnel who care for patients who are at high risk of acquiring infections, such as those in intensivecare units (ICU) or in transplant units, should avoid wearing arti cial nails and keep natural nails less than a quarter-inch long. When evaluating hand hygiene products for potential use in health care facilities, administrators or product selec-tion committees should consider the relative ef cacy of antiseptic agents against various pathogens and the accept-ability of hand hygiene products by personnel. Character-istics of a product that can affect acceptance and therefore usage include its smell, consistency, and color as well as its effect on the skin, particularly skin dryness. As part of its recommendations, the CDC is asking health care facilities to develop and implement a system for mea-suring improvements in adherence to these hand hygiene guidelines. Some of the suggested performance indicators include periodic monitoring of hand hygiene adherence and providing feedback to personnel regarding their per-formance, monitoring the volume of alcohol-based hand rub used per 1,000 patient-days, monitoring adherence to policies dealing with wearing arti cial nails, and diligently assessing the adequacy of health care personnel hand hygiene when outbreaks of infection occur. Allergic contact dermatitis due to alcohol hand rubs is very uncommon. However, with increasing use of such prod-ucts by health care personnel, it is likely that true allergic reactions will occasionally be encountered. Cleansing with alcohol-based hand rubs takes less time than traditional handwashing. In an 8-hour shift, an esti-mated 1 hour of an ICU nurse's time will be saved by using an alcohol-based hand rub. The guidelines should not be construed to legalize product claims that are not allowed by a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) product approval according to the FDA's Over-the-Counter Drug Review , nor are they intended to apply to consumer use of the products discussed.

The length of time for isolation precautions will vary depending on the nature and seriousness of the patient's infection or disease. Check with the facility's infection co ntrol department, local and state health departments, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), because recommendations can change for individual diseases or for new and emerging infections. Precautions Equipment needed Indications Standard precau-tions: Used for all patients regardless of diagnosis or presumed infection Gloves are indicated for use with all patients when touching blood and body fl uids, mucous membranes, or broken skin; when handling items or touching surfaces soiled with blood or body fl uids; and when performing venipuncture and other vascular access procedures. Masks and protective eyewear or a face shield are needed to protect mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and eyes during procedures that may generate drops of blood or other body fl uids. A gown or apron is indicated during procedures that are likely to generate splashing of blood or other body fl uids.Used when coming in contact with any of the following: Blood All body fl uids, secretions, and excretions, except sweat, regardless of whether they contain visible blood Skin that is not intact Mucous membranes Airborne precautions (used in addition to standard precau-tions): Used when microorganisms may be carried through air and dispersed widely by air currents, resulting in inhalation or deposition on a susceptible host Special air handling and ventilation procedures are needed to prevent the spread of infection.

Similar in form and content to the actual examination, the posttest consists of 150 questions based on brief clinical situations. The questions will help sharpen your test-taking skills, while assessing your knowledge of medical-surgical nursing theory and practice. To improve your chances for performing well, consider these suggestions: Read each clinical situation and question closely. Weigh the four options carefully, then select the option that best answers the question. ( Note: In this posttest, options are lettered A, B, C, and D to aid in later identi cation of correct answers and rationales. These letters won't appear on the certi cation examination.) Completely darken the circle in front of the answer that you select using a #2 pencil. (You must use a #2 pencil when taking the certi cation examination if you take a paper and pencil test.) Don't use check marks, Xs, or lines. If you decide to change your answer, erase the old answer completely. (The certi cation examination is scored electronically; an incomplete erasure may cause both answers to be scored, in which case you won't receive credit for answering the question.) If you have dif culty understanding a question or are unsure of the answer, place a small mark next to the question number and, if time permits, return to it later. If you have no idea of the correct answer, make an educated guess. (Only correct answers are counted in scoring the certi cation examination, so guessing is preferable to leaving a question unanswered.) After you complete the posttest, check your responses against the correct answers and rationales pro- vided on pages 418 to 433.

Fever and change in the clarity of urineQuestions rationales 1. Correct answer: D If Lyme disease goes untreated, arthritis, neurologic problems, and cardiac abnormalities may arise as late complications. The rst sign of Lyme disease is typically a skin lesion that enlarges and has a characteristic red border. However, not all patients develop this lesion. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because they aren't complications of Lyme disease. 2. Correct answer: C Melanomas have an irregular shape and lack uniformity in color. They may appear brown or black with red, white, or blue areas. Options A, B, and D contain inaccurate information. 3. Correct answer: D Facial lesions can contribute to situational low self-esteem and a disturbed body image. Kaposi's sarcoma is among the many psychosocial and physical traumas that may confront the patient with AIDS; anxiety, anger, grief, and depression are common emotional responses. The nurse who works with patients who have AIDS must develop excellent listening skills. The patient may be especially concerned that others will realize he has Kaposi's sarcoma. Option A doesn't provide emo-tional support to the patient. Option B ignores the patient's concerns. Option C is incorrect because the practitioner should inform the patient of the biopsy results, not the nurse. 4. Correct answer: B Zidovudine inhibits deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis within the virus that causes AIDS, interfering with viral replication. Options A, C, and D inaccurately describe the drug's action. 5. Correct answer: D Standard precautions stipulate that a health care worker who anticipates com- ing into contact with a patient's blood or body fl uids must wear gloves; this protects the health care worker. Option A is incorrect because reverse isolation is used to protect the patient from the health care worker. Option B is incorrect because a private room doesn't provide a method of barrier protection, which is needed for standard precautions. Option C is incorrect because a mask and gloves are needed only for anticipated contact with airborne droplets of blood or body fl uids; a gown is needed only for anticipated contact with splashes of blood or body fl uids. 6. Correct answer: C In partial-thickness burns, skin color varies from pink to cherry-red. Deep second-degree burns appear cherry-red and may have blisters that ooze fl uid. Options A and D are incorrect because they describe full-thickness burns. Option B is incorrect because it describes super cial partial-thickness burns. 7. Correct answer: B In a patient who has nasal packing in place, frequent swallowing may indicate bleeding in the posterior pharynx. Option A is incorrect because mouth dryness causes thirst, not frequent swallowing. Options C and D are incorrect because frequent swallowing isn't a response to analgesics. 8. Correct answer: C To prevent pressure on the graft site, which may cause graft displacement, the nurse should instruct the patient to lie on the nonoperative side. Option A is incorrect because the patient should cough or sneeze with his mouth open, not closed, to prevent increased pressure through the eustachian tube into the middle ear (which could displace the graft). Option B is incorrect because the patient should remain in bed for 24 hours after surgery to prevent graft displacement. Option D is incor-rect because rapid head movement could cause vertigo. 9. Correct answer: B With extensive, rapidly developing retinal detachment, a patient may report the sensation of a curtain dropping down in front of his eye. Options A, C, and D are incorrect because glau-coma, cataracts, and blepharitis don't cause this sensation. rationales 10. Correct answer: B The practitioner may prescribe digoxin for the patient with heart failure to increase contractility and slow the heart rate (and thus improve cardiac function); a vasodilating agent to decrease afterload; and a diuretic to reduce peripheral resistance (and thus improve cardiac output). Option A inaccurately suggests that anti-infl ammatory agents are used to treat heart failure; Option C inaccurately suggests that vasoconstricting agents are used. None of the drugs listed in Option D are prescribed for the patient with heart failure. 11. Correct answer: C When the dissecting aneurysm begins, severe chest pain (described as a tear- ing in the chest) develops; typically, the patient also has signs and symptoms of respiratory distress and ischemia of the central nervous system, limbs, kidneys, and mesentery. Option A describes a pos-sible cause\u2014not a symptom\u2014of the dissecting aneurysm. Options B and D aren't associated with this disorder. 12. Correct answer: A The nurse should encourage the patient to avoid caffeine and nicotine because they constrict vessels and would further impair his circulation; this includes encouraging the patient to quit smoking or chewing tobacco, avoid drinking caffeine-containing beverages, and avoid ingest-ing such drugs as amphetamines. Option B is incorrect because it would impair circulation. Option C is incorrect because the patient with peripheral vascular disease should keep the extremities warm and dry. This patient also should exercise daily, unless pain is experienced, not avoid daily exercise, as Option D suggests. 13. Correct answer: C Maintaining clear breath sounds would indicate that the patient has effective airway clearance. The respiratory rate in Option A is too high for an adult. The pulse oximetry reading in Option B is too low. Option D is incorrect because increased airway clearance would help decrease\u2014not increase\u2014the patient's anxiety. 14. Correct answer: C Lack of potassium intake (related to anorexia and nausea) plus potassium loss by way of gastric secretions (from vomiting) and intestinal fl uids (from diarrhea) puts this patient at high risk for a below-normal serum potassium level. Options A and D are incorrect because vomiting and diarrhea don't alter the body's calcium level; calcium is stored in bone and isn't affected by GI changes. Option B is incorrect because vomiting may increase the serum sodium level. 15. Correct answer: B A positive Chvostek's sign (contraction of facial muscles when the facial nerve is tapped) indicates neuromuscular irritability, a sign of hypocalcemia. Options A, C, and D are incorrect because a positive Chvostek's sign doesn't appear with those conditions. 16. Correct answer: D Diabetes insipidus results from lack of antidiuretic hormone, which causes signi cant urine losses. Such losses, in turn, lead to hypernatremia (an elevated serum sodium level), which causes dry and sticky mucous membranes, thirst, swollen tongue, and disorientation. Option A is incorrect because a serum sodium level of 135 mEq/L falls within the normal range and muscle cramps are a sign of hyponatremia. Option B is incorrect because numbness and a positive Trousseau's sign indi-cate hypocalcemia. Option C is incorrect because muscle irritability\u2014not weakness\u2014is characteristic of hypernatremia. 17. Correct answer: A Cardiac arrest leads to ischemia (resulting from decreased tissue perfusion) and to subsequent cardiac insuf ciency; cardiac insuf ciency causes anaerobic metabolism (metabolism occurring without oxygen), leading to lactic acid production. Ischemia of any organ or body part can cause an increase in the lactic acid level. Option B is incorrect because an irregular heartbeat doesn't necessarily cause acidosis. Option C is incorrect because sodium bicarbonate treatment causes alkalosis. Option D is incorrect because this type of acidosis occurs in diabetes mellitus. patients Cushing's syndrome (hyperadrenalism), laboratory ndings typically include sustained hyperglycemia, WBC count, hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. Option B is decreased WBC count, hyponatremia, and metabolic acidosis aren't doesn't decreased cortisol level and hyperkalemia (Option C) or hyponatremia and hypocalcemia (Option D). 19. Correct answer: C The nurse should tell the patient that only 5% of patients experience impotence after TURP. If the patient continues to seem worried, however, the nurse should advise him to speak with his surgeon. Options A and B wouldn't give the patient a chance to express his concerns. Option D is incorrect because the nurse should help the patient express his concerns initially as well as give him appropriate information; this doesn't require a referral to a psychiatric clinical nurse specialist. 20. Correct answer: B The nurse rst should check for indications of shock by taking the patient's vital signs. Clots in the urinary drainage indicate bleeding, which is common after TURP (especially during the rst 2 postoperative hours). After making sure the patient isn't in shock, the nurse should check the irrigation system (Option A), notify the practitioner (Option D), and administer ordered antispasmodic agents (Option C) because spasms can precipitate bleeding. 21. Correct answer: C The nurse should elicit the patient's concerns and listen actively as he expresses these concerns. Option A is incorrect because although the patient didn't plan to have children, he may view his sterility as yet another threat to his masculinity. The testicular cancer probably already has threatened his self-concept. Option B is incorrect because it invalidates the patient's feelings. Option D isn't the best response because the nurse can and should help the patient explore his feelings. At a later time, the nurse may suggest that the patient talk with his practitioner. 22. Correct answer: A Pain is the most common symptom of endometriosis. Option B is incorrect because infertility is a possible consequence of endometriosis. Options C and D don't refer to the most likely assessment nding for a patient with endometriosis. 23. Correct answer: A Although all of the options are important nursing interventions, monitoring for hemorrhage is the highest priority. Hemorrhage can lead to a life-threatening situation for the patient. The nurse should assess for signs and symptoms of hemorrhage every 15 minutes for the rst 2 hours, then at least hourly for the next 8 hours. 24. Correct answer: B Any activity or position that impedes venous outfl ow from the patient's head may increase blood volume inside the skull, possibly raising intracranial pressure (ICP). Increased ICP can cause brain damage and impair vital physiologic functions. Option A is incorrect because cerebral arterial pressure is affected by the balance between the arterial oxygen level and the arterial carbon diox-ide level\u2014not by the position ordered. Option C is incorrect because preventing fl exion contractures isn't a priority at this time. Option D is incorrect because the ordered position doesn't prevent aspiration of stomach contents. 25. Correct answer: D The hypothermia blanket and antipyretic medication can induce hypothermia, which in turn decreases brain metabolism and makes the brain less vulnerable to hypoxia by decreasing the need for oxygen. Option A is incorrect because diaphoresis doesn't cause hypoxia; antipyretic medi-cation may cause diaphoresis as vasodilation occurs. The integrity of intracerebral neurons (Option B) and osmotic pressure equalization (Option C) depend on an adequate supply of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and glucose, and may occur as a result of decreased cerebral metabolism and hypoxia. 26. Correct answer: C Stroke in evolution refers to continuing neurologic changes over 24 to 48 hours. The patient should be placed on his side because leaving a patient on his back may cause the tongue to Med-Surg_BM.indd 420 Med-Surg_BM.indd 420 8/3/2011 7:25:16 PM 8/3/2011 7:25:16 PMfall backward as well as the aspiration of secretions, resulting in airway obstruction that in turn may induce atelectasis and pneumonia. Option A is inappropriate for this patient because weakness on the right side (resulting from his left-sided lesion) would make him unable to maintain this position. Options B and D aren't priorities. 27. Correct answer: A A brain injury, such as the one this patient has suffered, can cause increased ICP. Slow respirations, a slow pulse, and elevated pulse pressure are associated with compromised cere-bral circulation. These changes signal increasing ICP\u2014a condition that calls for practitioner noti cation so that prompt medical intervention can help prevent additional damage. Although Options B, C, and D also are important, the nurse should take these actions only after notifying the practitioner. 28. Correct answer: A Listlessness and sleepiness suggest the patient has a decreased LOC\u2014the earli- est sign that his condition is deteriorating. Option A describes the components of the Glasgow Coma Scale, which the nurse should use to obtain an objective determination of the patient's LOC. Options B, C, and D are appropriate but don't take precedence over objective determination of the patient's LOC. 29. Correct answer: C Polyphagia (increased appetite), polydipsia (increased thirst), lethargy, and polyuria (increased urination) signal hyperglycemia and indicate a need to determine the patient's glu-cose level. Option A is incorrect because giving insulin won't affect the blood glucose level immediately. Option B is incorrect because the practitioner need not be noti ed of these common symptoms. Option D would worsen the patient's hyperglycemia. 30. Correct answer: D Dizziness, weakness, confusion, and disorientation signal an insulin reaction and severe hypoglycemia\u2014a common nding in diabetic patients who take insulin but miss a meal. Ketoacidosis (Option A) and hyperglycemia (Option B) are rare in a patient with diabetes who takes insulin and decreases his nutritional intake. Option C is incorrect because hyperlipidemia (an excessive blood fat level) doesn't cause hypoglycemia. 31. Correct answer: C AIDS isn't diagnosed until an AIDS-indicator condition occurs. Options A and B are incorrect because the ELISA test and the Western blot test identify HIV antibodies in the blood; a patient who is HIV-positive has already tested positive for HIV antibodies. Being HIV-positive isn't syn-onymous with a diagnosis of AIDS. Option D is incorrect because seroconversion is the basis for estab-lishing that a patient is HIV-positive, not for diagnosing AIDS. 32. Correct answer: B Because the patient's ABG measurements reveal hypoxemia, impaired gas exchange has the highest priority. Option A isn't relevant because the patient has a normal Pa co2 level, which means that breathing isn't a problem. Option C is incorrect because the data don't indicate a prob-lem with the patient's airway. Option D is incorrect because the patient with pneumonia already has an infection. 33. Correct answer: A Because the patient isn't in acute distress, the highest-priority nursing diagnosis is De cient knowledge related to spread of the infection . Options B, C, and D must be addressed but aren't priorities at this time; as the nurse gives the patient information about TB, these other nursing diagnoses may diminish in importance. 34. Correct answer: A Drinking alcohol daily during isoniazid therapy can induce drug-related hepati- tis. Option B is incorrect because the patient should avoid concomitant use of aluminum-containing ant-acids with isoniazid because they impair isoniazid absorption. Option C is incorrect because the patient should take isoniazid with meals for maximal absorption and to decrease GI upset. Option D gives answer: C When a chest tube is attached to suction, gentle bubbling should appear in the suction compartment continuously. Increasing the pressure should cause bubbling. None of the other options would correct the suction problem. 36. Correct answer: B High Fowler's position elevates the clavicles and helps the lungs to expand, thereby easing respirations. The other options wouldn't promote more comfortable breathing. 37. Correct answer: D An active ischemic injury in the myocardium causes displacement of the ST seg- ment. Options A, B, and C aren't associated with an MI. 38. Correct answer: B Bleeding is a major complication associated with streptokinase therapy. Strepto- kinase promotes systemic thrombolysis by activating plasminogen, which degrades brin clots; this can cause bleeding. Another complication to streptokinase is an allergic response. Although streptokinase may cause reperfusion arrhythmias, option A is incorrect because these arrhythmias usually require no treatment. Streptokinase isn't associated with chest pain (Option C) or pulmonary edema (Option D). 39. Correct answer: A Signs and symptoms of acute left ventricular dysfunction are associated primar- ily with pulmonary congestion, which is characterized by bilateral bibasilar crackles. Options B, C, and D are signs of right-sided heart failure. 40. Correct answer: B Various protocols are available for managing ventricular arrhythmias. Typically, the patient with more than ve or six PVCs per minute is treated, especially if the PVCs are multifocal; lidocaine is the most commonly used agent. Options A, C, and D don't address the patient's immediate needs. 41. Correct answer: D Exercising the upper extremities\u2014especially with heavy lifting\u2014can strain the myocardium. Options A, B, and C are appropriate discharge instructions for a patient recovering from an MI. 42. Correct answer: C Blood and body fl uid precautions are needed because hepatitis B is transmitted through the serum and body fl uids. Options A, B, and D are inappropriate for a patient with this disease. 43. Correct answer: B The patient with hepatitis B needs a high-protein\u2014not low-protein\u2014diet to enhance the recovery of injured liver cells. Options A, C, and D are inappropriate for a patient with hepatitis B. 44. Correct answer: D An S3 gallop is characteristic of heart failure; crackles indicate the presence of intra-alveolar fl uid, which may result from left-sided heart failure. Option A is incorrect because this patient wouldn't have clear breath sounds. Option B is incorrect because heart failure doesn't cause a murmur. Option C is incorrect because pleurisy, not heart failure, causes a friction rub. 45. Correct answer: D Cor pulmonale is a form of right-sided heart failure caused by pulmonary disease; only option D lists signs of right-sided heart failure. Option A is incorrect because respiratory excursion is reduced with COPD. Option B is incorrect because the patient with diagnosed COPD will have a prolonged expiratory phase. Option C is incorrect because the patient with COPD and cor pulmo-nale will have an increased respiratory rate. 46. Correct answer: C Pursed-lip and diaphragmatic breathing, which increase carbon dioxide elimi- nation, are the most effective ways to improve this patient's breathing. Option A must be done cautiously in patients with COPD because their breathing stimulus depends on a low arterial oxygen content. Option B would improve the patient's activity tolerance but not his ventilation. In conjunction with breathing exercises, option D is used to remove retained secretions and thus improve gas C Because this patient may feel full after even a small meal, he should eat smaller, more-frequent, high-calorie meals to obtain the energy he needs for breathing. Option A is incorrect because taking a bronchodilator at bedtime may contribute to insomnia. Option B is incorrect because most patients with COPD tolerate activity better if it's spaced throughout the day with frequent rest periods. Option D is incorrect because the patient should exercise before eating to obtain the energy for digestion. 48. Correct answer: B Iodine reduces thyroid vascularity and prevents release of thyroid hormone into the circulation. Propylthiouracil, which blocks thyroid hormone synthesis, is the drug most com-monly used to treat hyperthyroidism; methimazole has similar effects and can be used in patients allergic to propylthiouracil. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, is used to decrease patient anxiety and the cardiac effects of hyperthyroidism. Option A is incorrect because levothyroxine is used to treat hypothy-roidism, not hyperthyroidism. The adrenergic agents listed in Option C are inappropriate for the hyper-thyroid patient because they would further stimulate the cardiovascular system, which is already under stress from hypermetabolism. The drugs listed in Option D are used primarily to treat asthma and may lead to increased excitability and tachycardia in a patient with hyperthyroidism. 49. Correct answer: C Because hemorrhage and respiratory obstruction can develop after a subtotal thyroidectomy, the nurse must monitor vital signs every 15 minutes until the patient is stable, then every 30 minutes to 1 hour for the next several hours. Semi-Fowler's position promotes comfort and breathing and allows immobilization, which is needed to prevent strain on the suture line. Fluids should be given unless the patient experiences nausea and vomiting or has dif culty swallowing. A tracheostomy set is needed because airway obstruction may result from edema. Options A and D are incorrect because vital signs should be monitored more frequently, and the patient should be in semi-Fowler's position. Option B is incorrect because Trendelenburg's position would cause a decreased number of respirations and edema at the surgical site. 50. Correct answer: B In Addison's disease (adrenocortical insuf ciency), the release of adrenocortical hormones diminishes. Option A is incorrect because adrenocortical hormone release decreases rather than increases. Option C is incorrect because Addison's disease doesn't affect hormones produced by the adrenal medulla. Option D is incorrect because Addison's disease is thought to have an autoimmune etiology. 51. Correct answer: B Most of the blood fl ow to coronary arteries is supplied during diastole. Breath- ing patterns (Options A and C) don't affect blood fl ow. Coronary arteries receive only a minute portion of blood during systole (Option D). 52. Correct answer: B Enhancing myocardial oxygenation is always the rst priority when a patient exhibits signs or symptoms of cardiac compromise. Without adequate oxygen, the myocardium suffers damage. Decreasing the patient's anxiety (Option A), administering sublingual nitroglycerin to treat acute angina (Option C), and educating the patient (Option D) are important aspects of care delivery but don't take rst priority. 53. Correct answer: A Bronchodilators are the rst line of treatment for asthma because bronchocon- striction is the cause of reduced airfl ow. Beta-adrenergic blockers (Option B) aren't used to treat asthma and can cause bronchoconstriction. Inhaled or oral steroids (Options C and D) may be given to reduce the infl ammation but aren't used for emergency relief. 54. Correct answer: D Incentive spirometry requires the patient to take deep breaths and promotes lung expansion. Chest physiotherapy (Option A) helps mobilize secretions but won't prevent atelectasis. Placing the patient on mechanical ventilation (Option B) or reducing his oxygen requirements (Option C) won't affect the development of atelectasis.Answers and rationales 55. Correct answer: B To attempt to convert the rhythm, the nurse should rst de brillate the patient with a monophasic de brillator at 360 joules. If this fails, then the nurse should continue CPR (Option C) for 2 minutes and attempt to de brillate again. Epinephrine (Option A) and vasopressin (Option D) may be given, but not until after the rst two de brillation attempts. 56. Correct answer: D Lower back pain results from expansion of the aneurysm. The expansion causes pressure in the abdominal cavity, and the pain is referred to the lower back. Abdominal pain (Option A) is the most common symptom resulting from impaired circulation. Absent pedal pulses (Option B) are a sign of no circulation and occur after a ruptured aneurysm or in peripheral vascular disease. Angina (Option C) is associated with atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries. 57. Correct answer: D A patient with pancreatitis should avoid foods and beverages that can cause a relapse of the disease, including caffeine, which is a stimulant that will further irritate the pancreas. The patient should avoid all alcohol, not just limit his intake (Option C), because chronic alcohol use is one of the causes of pancreatitis. The patient should maintain a diet low in fats and high in calories, especially carbohydrates, not high in fats (Option A) or low in calories (Option B). 58. Correct answer: A Because peritonitis can advance to shock and circulatory failure, fl uid and elec- trolyte balance takes priority to maintain hemodynamic stability. Although the patient may periodically need gastric irrigation (Option B) to ensure patency of the nasogastric tube, pain management (Option C) for comfort, and psychosocial care (Option D) to address concerns such as anxiety, these don't take prior-ity. 59. Correct answer: B Peritonitis is characterized by abdominal pain that causes rigidity of the abdom- inal muscles. Abdominal distention (Option A) may occur as a late sign but doesn't occur early on. Bowel sounds may be normal or decreased, not increased (Option C). Right upper quadrant pain (Option D) is characteristic of cholecystitis or hepatitis. 60. Correct answer: C Abnormalities of the pulmonic valve are auscultated at the second left inter- costal space along the left sternal border. Abnormalities of the aortic valve (Option A) are heard at the second intercostal space to the right of the sternum; of the mitral valve (Option B), at the fth intercostal space in the midclavicular line; and of the tricuspid valve (Option D), at the third and fourth intercostal spaces along the sternal border. 61. Correct answer: C Troponin I levels rise rapidly and are detectable within 1 hour of myocardial injury; they aren't detectable in people without cardiac injury. LD (Option A) is present in almost all body tissues and not speci c to heart muscle, although LD isoenzymes may be useful in diagnosing cardiac injury. A CBC (Option B) is obtained to review blood counts, and a complete chemistry is obtained to review electrolytes. Because CK (Option D) is widely distributed in tissues, elevations in total serum CK lack speci city for cardiac damage. 62. Correct answer: C Because the patient's PaCO2 is high at 80 mm Hg and his metabolic measure (HCO3) is normal, he has respiratory acidosis. If he had an HCO3 below 22 mEq/L, he would have met- abolic acidosis (Option A). His pH is less than 7.35, indicating acidosis, which eliminates metabolic and respiratory alkalosis (Options B and D) as possibilities. 63. Correct answer: A The rst action the nurse should take is administering oxygen. The nurse can then take vital signs (Option D) and immediately notify the physician. If the patient doesn't already have an I.V . catheter in place, the nurse can insert one (Option B) if anaphylactic shock is developing. Obtain-ing a CBC (Option C) wouldn't help resolve the emergency 7:25:16 PM 8/3/2011 7:25:16 PM64. Correct answer: C Because this is an acute episode, the nurse should listen to the patient's lungs to see if anything has changed. The nurse shouldn't check to see if the patient can have medication (Option D), nor should she give this patient medication, especially a sedative (Option A), if he's having dif culty breathing. This patient is having an acute episode and giving him support rather than advising him to calm down (Option B) is more appropriate. 65. Correct answer: A Beta-adrenergic blockers work by blocking beta receptors in the myocardium, reducing the response to catecholamines and sympathetic nerve stimulation. They protect the myo-cardium, helping to reduce the risk of another infarction by decreasing the workload of the heart and decreasing myocardial oxygen demand. Calcium channel blockers (Option B) reduce the workload of the heart by decreasing heart rate. Opioids (Option C) reduce myocardial oxygen demand, promote vasodila-tion, and decrease anxiety. Nitrates (Option D) reduce myocardial oxygen consumption by decreasing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload) and systemic vascular resistance (afterload). 66. answer: B Jugular vein distension results from elevated venous pressure and indicates a failure of the heart to pump. Jugular vein distention isn't a symptom of abdominal aortic aneurysm (Option A) or pneumothorax (Option D). Although a severe MI (Option C) can progress to heart failure, the MI itself doesn't cause jugular vein distention. 67. Correct answer: D The nurse's role is to provide general information about the surgery and what to expect before and after surgery, and to give emotional support during this time. The nurse's role isn't to decide if the patient should have surgery (Option A) or to give minute details of the surgery (Option C). If the patient or family requests extremely detailed information, the surgeon should answer their ques-tions. Emotional support alone (Option B) during this time isn't suf cient. 68. Correct answer: C A 165-lb patient weighs 75 kg (2.2 lb = 1 kg). 20 units \u00d7 75 kg \u00d7 1 hour = 1,500 units/hour. 69. Correct answer: A One of the most common signs of digoxin toxicity is the visual disturbance known as the green halo sign. The other medications aren't associated with such an effect. 70. Correct answer: D The patient needs to know that uric acid crystals collect in the joint of the great toe and cause infl ammation. The kidneys excrete uric acid, an end product of metabolism; they don't pro- duce uric acid (Option C). The patient should be on a low-purine diet, not a high-purine diet (Option B). Good foot care (Option A) doesn't affect the development of complications. 71. Correct answer: A Early indications of MS include slurred speech and diplopia. Grief (Option B) isn't a clinical manifestation. Paralysis (Option C) is a late symptom of MS. Although depression and a short attention span may occur, dementia (Option D) is rarely associated with MS. 72. Correct answer: B An aura occurs in some patients as a warning before a seizure. The patient may experience a certain smell, a vision such as fl ashing lights, or a sensation. Atonic seizure (Option A) or drop attack refers to an abrupt loss of muscle tone. Icterus (Option C) is another term for jaundice. Dur-ing a postictal experience (Option D), which occurs after a seizure, the patient may be confused, somno-lent, and fatigued. 73. Correct answer: D Quadriplegia occurs as a result of cervical spine injuries. Aphasia (Option A) refers to dif culty expressing or understanding spoken words. Hemiparesis (Option B) describes weak- ness of one side of the body. Paraplegia (Option C) occurs as a result of injury at or below the thoracic area of the spinal cord. 74. Correct answer: B Histamine-2 receptor antagonists such as ranitidine reduce acid secretion; they work by inhibiting, not stimulating, gastrin secretion (Option C). Antacids neutralize acid (Option A), and mucosal barrier forti ers protect the mucosal barrier (Option answer: D A patient with a duodenal ulcer feels pain when his stomach is empty; eating food or taking antacids relieves the pain. The other symptoms result from gastric ulcer. 76. Correct answer: C To reduce the occurrences of dumping syndrome, the patient should be taught to lie down after eating for 30 minutes; drink fl uids only between meals, not with meals (Option A); eat smaller, more-frequent meals in a semi-recumbent position, not three meals a day (Option B); and avoid sweets and follow a low-carbohydrate, high-protein, moderate-fat diet, not a high-carbohydrate, low-fat, low-protein diet (Option D). 77. Correct answer: B The nurse should rst assess this patient for such complications as perforation, fever, abscess, stula, and sepsis; only after that should the nurse administer antibiotics (Option A) to reduce the infection. Surgery (Option D) is performed after the acute infection has subsided. Only a small percentage of these patients undergo lithotripsy (Option C). 78. Correct answer: C A pulse oximetry level above 93% and a normal respiratory rate demonstrate probable lung expansion and normal chest tube functioning. Sitting upright, leaning slightly forward (Option A) suggests that the patient still has impaired gas exchange because this position increases lung expansion. Requesting pain medication as needed (Option B) and remaining pain-free (Option D) are expected outcomes for a nursing diagnosis of Acute pain . 79. Correct answer: C In pleural effusion, in the pleural space, impairing transmis- sion of normal breath sounds. Because of the acoustic mismatch, breath sounds are diminished. Crackles (short explosive or popping sounds) (Option A) commonly accompany atelectasis, interstitial brosis, and left-sided heart failure. Rhonchi (low-pitched sounds with a snoring quality) (Option B) suggest secretions in the large airways. Wheezes (high-pitched, hissing sounds) (Option D) result from narrowed airways, as in asthma, COPD, and bronchitis. 80. Correct answer: A The patient with rheumatoid arthritis needs to understand that the disease is somewhat unpredictable characterized by periods of exacerbation and remission. Although there's no cure (Option B), symptoms can be managed at times (Option D). Surgery (Option C) may be indicated in some cases, but not always. 81. Correct answer: A Cardiomyopathy isn't usually caused by plaque in the arteries or atherosclero- sis. The etiology in most cases is a viral (Option B) or bacterial (Option C) infection or cardiotoxic effects of drugs (Option D) or alcohol. 82. Correct answer: A Atrial brillation is de ned as chaotic, asynchronous, electrical activity in the atrial tissue. On an ECG, uneven baseline brillating waves appear rather than distinguishable P waves. Ventricular brillation (Option B) results in a chaotic rhythm with no QRS complexes. Atrial fl utter (Option C) results in saw-tooth fl utter waves. P waves are present in sinus tachycardia (Option D). 83. Correct answer: D Initially, the decrease in cardiac output results in a decrease in cerebral blood fl ow that causes restlessness, agitation, or confusion. Cyanosis (Option A), decreased urine output (Option B), and presence of a fourth heart sound (Option C) are all later signs of shock. 84. Correct answer: C According to JNC 7, a systolic blood pressure of 140 to 159 mm Hg or a diastolic pressure of 90 to 99 mm Hg represents stage 1 hypertension. A systolic pressure greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg or diastolic pressure greater than or equal to 100 mm Hg represents stage 2 hypertension (Option A). A systolic pressure of 120 to 139 mm Hg or diastolic pressure of 80 to 89 mm Hg represents prehypertension (Option B). A systolic pressure less than 120 mm Hg and diastolic pressure less than 80 mm Hg are considered normal (Option D). Med-Surg_BM.indd 426 Med-Surg_BM.indd 426 8/3/2011 7:25:16 PM 8/3/2011 7:25:16 PM85. Correct answer: B The kidneys respond to a rise in blood pressure by excreting sodium and excess water. This response ultimately affects systolic blood pressure by regulating blood volume. Retaining sodium and water (Option C) would only further increase blood pressure. Sodium and water travel together across the membrane in the kidneys; one can't travel without the other (Options A and D). 86. Correct answer: D Elastic leg compression helps venous return to the heart, thereby decreasing venous stasis. Sitting (Option A) and bed rest (Option B) are contraindicated because both promote decreased blood return to the heart and venous stasis. Although ice packs (Option C) help reduce edema, they also cause vasoconstriction and impede blood fl ow. 87. Correct answer: C As blood collects in the peritoneal cavity, dilation and distention of the abdo- men occur, causing an increase in abdominal girth. The patient with DIC would have hypotension and tachycardia, not hypertension (Option A) and bradycardia (Option D). Petechiae (Option B) result when blood from tiny blood vessels leaks into the skin. 88. Correct answer: B The upright position, leaning slightly forward, avoids increasing vascular pres- sure in the nose and helps the patient avoid aspirating blood. Lying supine (Option A) won't prevent aspiration of blood. Nose blowing (Option C) can dislodge any clotting that has occurred. Bending at the waist (Option D) increases vascular pressure and promotes bleeding rather than stopping it. 89. Correct answer: C Essential thrombocytopenia is linked with immunologic disorders, such as SLE and HIV. Dressler's syndrome (Option A) is pericarditis that occurs after an MI and isn't linked to SLE. Moderate to severe anemia is associated with SLE, not polycythemia (Option B). A type of hemophilia, von Willebrand's disease (Option D) isn't linked to SLE. 90. Correct answer: C Laboratory ndings for patients with SLE usually show pancytopenia, elevated ANA titer, and decreased serum complement levels, not elevated serum complement levels (Option A). Thrombocytosis and elevated sedimentation rate (Option B) are not diagnostic for SLE. Patients may have elevated BUN and creatinine levels (Option D) from nephritis, but the increase doesn't indicate SLE. 91. Correct answer: A DVT is more common in immobilized patients who have had surgical proce- dures such as total hip replacement. Pregnancy (Option B) can cause varicose veins, which can lead to venous stasis, but it isn't a primary cause of DVT. A patient recovering from an injury (Option C) or pneumonia (Option D) may have decreased mobility but isn't at the highest risk for developing DVT. 92. Correct answer: D Leg elevation alleviates the pressure caused by thrombosis and occlusion by assisting venous return. Applying heat (Option A) would dilate the vessels and pool blood in the area of the thrombus, increasing the risk of further thrombus formation. Bed rest (Option B) adds to venous stasis by increasing the risk of thrombosis formation. When DVT is diagnosed, exercise (Option C) isn't recommended until the clot has dissolved. 93. Correct answer: B The nurse should recognize that these are common signs of Parkinson's disease, which results from degeneration of the substantia nigra in the basal ganglia of the brain where dopamine is produced and stored. This degeneration results in motor dysfunction. These aren't the typical signs of depression (Option A) or dementia (Option D). The effects of antipsychotic medication (Option C) can mimic the extrapyramidal signs of Parkinson's disease, but these drugs aren't indicated for treating Par-kinson's disease. 94. Correct answer: D Serous drainage around the pin insertion site is a normal nding; some institu- tions don't recommend crust removal because of its protective nature. A pale, cool extremity (Option A) may indicate arterial compromise. Erythema and swelling (Option B) signal infection. Severe muscle spasms (Option C) may indicate improper alignment of the body or traction.Answers and rationales 427 95. Correct answer: B The operative leg must be kept abducted to prevent dislocation of the hip. Plac- ing the patient on the left or right side with knee bent (Options A and C) doesn't promote abduction, and acute fl exion of the operated hip may cause dislocation. The head of the bed may be raised 35 to 49 degrees, not 90 degrees (Option D). 96. Correct answer: A After surgical repair of the hip, the legs and hips should be in the abducted position. The adducted, prone, and subluxated positions (Options B, C, and D) don't keep the prosthesis within the acetabulum. 97. Correct answer: C If the chest tube is inserted correctly, the nurse will hear normal bronchovesicu- lar breath sounds in that area, and the patient's oxygenation status will improve; the patient should undergo a chest X-ray to ensure reexpansion. Options A, B, and D are abnormal breath sounds. 98. Correct answer: D The blood clot blocks blood fl ow to a region of the lung tissue. That area remains ventilated, but because blood fl ow is blocked, no gas exchange can occur in that region, and a ventilation-perfusion mismatch occurs. Ventilation (Options A, B, and C) isn't initially affected by a blood clot because air can still move normally through the bronchial tree. 99. Correct answer: C The umbrella lter is placed in a patient at high risk for the formation of more clots that could potentially become pulmonary emboli. It breaks the clots into small pieces that cantly occlude the pulmonary vasculature. The lter doesn't prevent further clot formation (Option A) or release anticoagulants (Option D). It also doesn't collect the clots (Option B); if it did, it would have to be emptied periodically, requiring further surgery. 100. Correct answer: D Pleural fl uid normally seeps continually into the space from the capil- laries lining the parietal pleura is reabsorbed by the visceral pleural capillaries and lymphatics. Any condition that interferes with either the secretion or drainage of this fl uid can lead to a pleural effusion. The collapse of alveoli (Option A) or a bronchiole (Option B) has no particular name. Fluid within the alveolar space (Option C) isn't in the pleural space; such fl uid accumulation can result from heart failure or adult respiratory distress syndrome. 101. Correct answer: A Warfarin prevents vitamin K from synthesizing certain clotting factors. This oral anticoagulant can be given over the long term. Heparin (Option B) is a parenteral anticoagulant that interferes with coagulation by readily combining with antithrombin; it can't be given by mouth. Neither furosemide (Option C) nor metoprolol (Option D) affects anticoagulation. 102. Correct answer: C Furosemide is a potassium-depleting diuretic can cause In hypokalemia increases myocardial excitability, leading to ventricular tachycardia. Hypocalcemia (Option A), which slows conduction through the atrioventricular junction, can cause such bradyarrhyth-mias as atrioventricular block. Hypermagnesemia (Option B) may lead to bradycardia, not tachycardia. Hypernatremia (Option D) may cause sinus tachycardia as a result of water loss. 103. Correct answer: A Although fever, chills, hemoptysis, dyspnea, cough, and pleuritic chest pain (Options B, C, and D) are the common signs and symptoms of pneumonia, an elderly patient may rst appear with only an altered mental status and dehydration resulting from a blunted immune response. 104. Correct answer: C The patient is having dif culty breathing and is probably becoming hypoxic. As an emergency measure, the nurse can provide oxygen without waiting for a physician's order. Antibi-otics (Option A) may be warranted, but this isn't a nursing decision. The patient should be maintained on bed rest (Option B) if he's dyspneic to minimize his oxygen demands, but providing additional oxygen will deal more immediately with his problem. The patient will need nutritional support (Option D), but while dyspneic, he may be unable to spare the energy needed to eat and at the same time maintain adequate oxygenation. Med-Surg_BM.indd 428 Opioids such as morphine can cause respiratory arrest if given in large quanti- ties. It's unlikely the patient will have an asthma attack (Option A), a seizure (Option C), or wake up on his own (Option D). 106. Correct answer: B After gastric resection, a patient may require total parenteral nutrition or jejunostomy tube feedings to maintain adequate nutritional status, which promotes healing. Body image (Option A) isn't the major concern for the patient at this point because clothing can cover the incision site. Although the patient needs wound care at the incision site to prevent infection, he doesn't need addi-tional skin care measures (Option C). If spiritual needs (Option D) arise, they should be addressed when the patient demonstrates a readiness to share those needs. 107. Correct answer: B Although all the nurse should address body image (Option A), sexual con- cerns (Option C), and skin care (Option D) as needed, ostomy care-including the crucial task of helping the patient learn to safely manage the ostomy before discharge-takes priority. 108. Correct answer: C Promoting bowel rest takes priority during an acute exacerbation of Crohn's disease. The nurse accomplishes this by decreasing activity, not encouraging ambulation (Option B), and initially putting the patient on nothing-by-mouth status, not taking steps to increase his weight (Option A); although weight loss may occur, bowel rest still takes priority. Rectal bleeding (Option D) doesn't typically occur in Crohn's disease. 109. Correct answer: C Lack of intrinsic factor following gastrectomy could cause pernicious anemia as the result of the patient's inability to absorb Vitamin B12. The presence of a colostomy (Option A), GERD (Option B), or dumping syndrome (Option D) wouldn't place a patient at risk for developing anemia. 110. Correct answer: B Thrombocytopenia is a decreased number of platelets. In adults, this would be less than 100,000/ mL. A normal platelet count (Option A) ranges from 140,000/ mL to 400,000/ mL. Thrombocytopathy (Option C) is platelet dysfunction, and thrombocytosis (Option D) is an excess num-ber of platelets. 111. Correct answer: C Typically, intermittent low back pain is the rst indication of ankylosing spondylitis. Red, painful, swollen joints (Option A) occur with rheumatoid arthritis. Although ankylos-ing spondylitis may cause fatigue, it rarely produces night sweats (Option B). Neck pain and stiffness (Option D) from involvement of the cervical spine are relatively late manifestations. 112. Correct answer: C Chronic lymphocytic leukemia causes a proliferation of small, abnormal, mature B lymphocytes and decreased antibodies; it can also cause thrombocytopenia. Uncontrolled proliferation of granulocytes (Option B) occurs in myelogenous leukemia. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (Option A) and aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase (Option D) levels aren't affected. 113. Correct answer: C The patient needs to drink 3 to 5 qt (3 to 5 L) of fl uid each day-not restrict fl uid intake (Option B)-to dilute calcium and uric acid, reducing the risk of renal dysfunction. Walking, not bed rest (Option A), is encouraged to prevent further bone demineralization. The lower extremities don't need to be elevated (Option D). 114. Correct answer: D Immune function is important in the healing process, and diminished func- tioning may slow or prevent the healing process from taking place. Laboratory and kidney function test results (Options A and B) are important, but aren't the main factors in determining interventions. Although wound healing declines with age (Option C), healthy behaviors (such as proper nutrition and exercise) can enhance the older patient's response to tissue trauma.Answers and rationales suppress eosinophils, lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and other microorganisms, inhibiting the natural infl ammatory process in an infected or injured part of the body. This promotes resolution of infl ammation, stabilizes lysosomal membranes, decreases capillary permeability, and depresses phagocytosis of tissues by WBCs, thus blocking the release of more infl am- matory materials. Corticosteroids don't affect the sympathetic response (Option A), pain receptors (Option B), or neural transmission (Option D). 116. Correct answer: D Neutropenia occurs when the absolute neutrophil count falls below 1,000/mm3, refl ecting a severe risk for infection. The nurse should provide a low-bacterial diet, which means elimi- nating fresh fruits and vegetables; avoid invasive procedures such as enemas because they increase the infection risk; and practice frequent hand hygiene to lower the infection risk. Using a soft toothbrush and electric razor, avoiding enemas, and monitoring for bleeding (Option A) are thrombocytopenia precau-tions. Putting on a mask, gown, and gloves when entering the patient's room (Option B) is reverse isola-tion. A neutropenic patient doesn't need a clear liquid diet or sodium restrictions (Option C). 117. Correct answer: D A patient with DKA would receive insulin to lower glucose and I.V. fl uids to correct hypotension. Glucagon (Option A) is given to treat hypoglycemia; DKA involves hyperglyce-mia. Blood products (Option B) aren't needed to correct DKA. Glucocorticoids (Option C) aren't needed because the adrenal glands aren't involved. 118. Correct answer: D In HHNS, enough insulin is released to prevent ketosis but not enough to pre- vent hyperglycemia. Diabetes insipidus (Option A) doesn't involve hyperglycemia. Diabetic ketoacidosis (Option B) involves hyperglycemia and ketosis. In type 2 diabetes mellitus (Option C), the body produces insulin, but hyperglycemia results from insulin resistance or insuf ciency. 119. Correct answer: C During periods of infection or illness, an insulin-dependent patient may need even more insulin\u2014not less insulin (Option B) or no change (Option A)\u2014to compensate for increased blood glucose levels. Because the patient has insulin-dependent diabetes, oral antidiabetic agents (Option D) wouldn't be indicated. 120. Correct answer: C Repeating what the patient has said (or describing his feelings) encourages the patient to elaborate on his thoughts and feelings. Telling him not to worry (Option A) or saying that Hodgkin's disease is very treatable (Option B) ignores his feelings and offers false reassurance. Telling a patient what to do, such as calling his minister (Option D), also ignores his feelings. 121. Correct answer: C Human blood can contain an inherited D antigen. People with the D anti- gen have Rh-positive blood type; those lacking the antigen have Rh-negative blood. A person with Rh-negative blood must receive Rh-negative blood, not Rh-positive blood (Options A, B, and D). If an Rh-negative person receives Rh-positive blood, he develops anti-Rh agglutinins, and subsequent transfusions with Rh-positive blood may cause serious reactions, including clumping and hemolysis of red blood cells. 122. Correct answer: B Enemas are contraindicated in an acute abdominal condition of unknown origin (such as suspected appendicitis) as well as after recent colon or rectal surgery or MI, so the nurse should question the physician about the order. Options A, C, and D are correct only when enema admin-istration is appropriate. 123. Correct answer: C Fluid shifts to the site of the bowel obstruction, causing a fl uid de cit\u2014not excess fl uid (Option D)\u2014in the intravascular spaces. If the obstruction isn't resolved immediately, the patient may experience Imbalanced nutrition: Less than body requirements (Option A); however, De cient fl uid volume takes priority. The patient also may experience pain (Option B), but that nursing diagnosis also takes lower priority. Med-Surg_BM.indd 430 Med-Surg_BM.indd 430 8/3/2011 7:25:16 PM 8/3/2011 7:25:16 PM124. Correct answer: B The patient with irritable bowel syndrome needs to be on a diet high in ber (at least 25 g/day) but that doesn't contain fatty foods, which may precipitate symptoms. The other Options provide too little ber or too much fat. 125. Correct answer: A Infl ammation of the pancreas causes it to excrete pancreatic enzymes. The infl ammation also causes a blockage of the ducts from the pancreas to the GI tract; therefore, the pancre- atic enzymes are released into the blood, resulting in an elevation of amylase and lipase levels. Carbohy-drate metabolism is impaired secondary to damage to pancreatic beta cells. This impairment causes the patient to become hyperglycemic. As in many other disease processes, the serum calcium level decreases because of the saponi cation of calcium by fatty acids in the area of the infl amed pancreas. 126. Correct answer: C Hepatitis A can result from contact with contaminated feces and may be trans- mitted through infected water, milk, or food, especially shell sh from contaminated waters. Hepatitis B results from blood or sexual contact (Options A and D). Hepatitis C is usually caused by contact with infected blood, including blood transfusions (Option B). 127. Correct answer: A Recognizing the rupture of esophageal varices, or hemorrhage, takes prior- ity because the patient could succumb to this quickly. Although not as important, the nurse should also focus on controlling blood pressure (Option B) because doing so helps reduce the risk of variceal rupture. Lower priority measures include teaching the patient what foods he should avoid (such as spicy foods) (Option C) and explaining what varices are (Option D). 128. Correct answer: C Clotting factors may not be produced normally when a patient has cirrhosis, indicating an increased potential for bleeding and resulting in a prolonged prothrombin time. There's no associated change in carbon dioxide level (Option A) or pH (Option B) unless the patient is develop-ing other comorbidities, such as metabolic alkalosis. In acute cirrhosis, the WBC count can be, but isn't always, elevated (Option D). 129. Correct answer: C High bilirubin levels irritate peripheral nerves, causing an intense itching sensation. Itching isn't a symptom of prolonged prothrombin time (Option A), decreased protein levels (Option B), or increased aspartate aminotransferase levels (Option D). 130. Correct answer: D The patient should receive fl uid and electrolyte replacement as well as antibi- otics and blood replacement. He should undergo NG tube suctioning to prevent further spillage of stom-ach contents into the perineal cavity, not have an NG tube removed (Option A). Antacids (Option B) and H 2-receptor antagonists (Option C) aren't helpful in this situation. 131. Correct answer: A Straining at stool after prostatectomy can cause bleeding. Small blood clots or pieces of tissue commonly are passed in the urine for up to 2 weeks postoperatively (Option B). Tub baths (Option C) are prohibited because they cause dilation of pelvic blood vessels. Other activities are resumed based on the guidance of the physician (Option D). Sexual intercourse and driving are usually prohibited for about 3 weeks; exercising and returning to work are usually prohibited for about 6 weeks. 132. Correct answer: B The patient needs to return for follow-up urine cultures because he may have asymptomatic bacteriuria. Consuming dairy products (Option A) won't contribute to pyelone-phritis. The p atient must take the full course of antibiotics, regardless of his signs and symptoms (Option C). Pyelonephritis can recur as a relapse or new infection, frequently within 2 weeks of completing therapy (Option D). 133. Correct answer: B A dusky or cyanotic stoma indicates insuf cient blood supply, an emergency that needs prompt intervention. The stoma should be red and moist (Option A), indicating adequate blood fl ow. A urine output of less than 30 mL/hour or no urine output for more than 15 minutes should be reported; a urine output of more than 30 mL/hour is normal (Option C). Slight bleeding from the stoma when changing the appliance (Option D) may occur because the intestinal mucosa answer: C Urine retention is usually a temporary problem that requires insertion of a straight catheter. A coud\u00e9 catheter (Option A) is used only when it's dif cult to insert a standard cathe- ter, usually because of an enlarged prostate. An indwelling urinary catheter (Option B) is used for longer-term bladder problems. A three-way catheter (Option D) is used for patients who need bladder irrigation such as after a prostate resection. 135. Correct answer: B The patient is showing signs of an allergy to the iodine in the contrast medium. The rst action is to make sure the patient's airway is patent. If it's compromised, the nurse should call a cardiac arrest code. Checking the patient's vital signs (Option A) and calling the physician (Option D), although important nursing actions, should take place after making sure the patient's airway is patent. Applying a cold pack to the I.V. site (Option C) isn't indicated. 136. Correct answer: C Although the cause of diabetes insipidus is unknown, it may occur secondary to head trauma, brain tumors, or surgical ablation of the pituitary gland. Addison's disease (Option A) is caused by a de ciency of cortical hormones, whereas Cushing's syndrome (Option B) results from an excess of cortical hormones. Hypothyroidism (Option D) occurs when the thyroid gland secretes low lev-els of thyroid hormone. 137. Correct answer: A Overproduction of adrenocortical hormone results in growth arrest and obe- sity. Weight loss and heat intolerance (Option B) indicate thyroid hormone overproduction. Changes in skin texture and low body temperature (Option C) indicate thyroid hormone underproduction. Polyuria and dehydration (Option D) indicate diabetic ketoacidosis. 138. Correct answer: D In a patient with Cushing's syndrome, increased mineralocorticoid activity, which results in sodium and water retention, commonly contributes to hypertension and heart failure. Hypoglycemia and dehydration (Option A) are uncommon in a patient with Cushing's syndrome. Dia-betes mellitus and hyperglycemia may develop, but hypotension (Option B) isn't part of the disease pro-cess. Pulmonary edema and dehydration (Option C) also aren't complications of Cushing's syndrome. 139. Correct answer: C Diabetic ketoacidosis stems from an absence or inadequate amount of insulin and leads to a series of biochemical disorders. Diabetes insipidus (Option A) is caused by a de ciency of vasopressin. Hyperaldosteronism (Option B) is an excess of aldosterone production, causing sodium and fl uid excesses and hypertension. HHNS (Option D) is a coma state characterized by hyperglycemia and hyperosmolarity. 140. Correct answer: D Graves' disease is another name for hyperthyroidism, which would require a thyroid panel. A patient with Graves' disease wouldn't typically need serum glucose or calcium levels (Options A and B) or a lipid panel (Option C) because Graves' disease involves the thyroid. 141. Correct answer: D The nurse should always reassess the patient's ABCs when his ICP is elevated (normal ICP ranges from 0 to 15 mm Hg). The patient's MAP should be maintained at or above 90 mm Hg, not below 90 mm Hg (Option A). The head of the bed should be elevated between 15 and 30 degrees to promote venous drainage, not lowered to less than 15 degrees (Option B). External stimulation, such as visitors (Option C), should be limited because it could increase the patient's ICP. 142. Correct answer: A In most cases, patients should be out of bed the rst postoperative day. Using a chairlike brace for the lower back when out of bed rather than maximizing bracing while in bed (Option B), frequent repositioning rather than limiting movement (Option C), and using a rm rather than soft mattress (Option D) helps to minimize complications. Med-Surg_BM.indd 432 Med-Surg_BM.indd 432 8/3/2011 7:25:16 PM These symptoms suggest cholinergic crisis or excessive acetylcholinesterase medication and typically appear 45 to 60 minutes after the last dose of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Atropine, an anticholinergic drug, is used to antagonize acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The other drugs are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Edrophonium (Option C) is used to diagnose and pyridostigmine bromide (Option A) is used to treat myasthenia gravis and would worsen these symptoms. Acyclovir (Option D) is an antiviral and wouldn't be used to treat these symptoms. 144. Correct answer: B Complaints of halos around lights is a common nding in a patient with glau- coma. Other signs and symptoms include IOP\u2014not an IOP of 15 mm Hg (Option C), which falls within the normal range of 10 to 21 mm Hg\u2014loss of peripheral vision or blind spots, reddened sclera, a rm globe (not a soft globe, as in Option D), decreased accommodation, and occasional eye pain; patients may also be asymptomatic. Glaucoma doesn't cause double vision (Option A). 145. Correct answer: B The prosthesis should be applied upon rising in the morning. The stump and prosthesis should be inspected and cleaned daily with a mild soap, not an antiseptic soap (Option C) and not weekly (Options A and D). The prosthesis should be kept clean to prevent irritation or pressure areas from dirt or bacteria. 146. Correct answer: B In tamponade, fl uid accumulates in the pericardial sac, hindering motion of the heart muscle and causing it to pump inef ciently, which results in signs of cardiogenic shock. Ana- phylactic and septic shock (Options A and D) are types of distributive shock in which fl uid is displaced from the capillaries and leaks into surrounding tissues. Hypovolemic shock (Option C) involves the actual loss of fl uid. 147. Correct answer: C Pentamidine isethionate can cause permanent diabetes mellitus and requires monitoring of blood sugar levels. The patient's electrolyte levels, heart rate, and CBC (Options A, B, and D) can be monitored less frequently. 148. Correct answer: C The fl ow rate is determined by the rate of infusion and the number of drops per milliliter of fl uid being administered: gtt/mL \u00d7 amount to be infused divided by the number of minutes = the I.V. fl ow rate. 15 gtt/mL \u00d7 1,000 mL = 15,000 15,000 mL divided by 360 minutes = 41.6 gtt/minute, which rounds up to a fl ow rate of 42 gtt/minute. 149. Correct answer: B A condom catheter uses a condom-type device to drain urine away from the patient. Diapering the patient (Option A) may keep urine away from the body but the patient (if he's alert) or family may object because they feel it's demeaning to the patient. Because the patient with Parkinson's disease is already prone to infections of the urinary tract, he shouldn't have an indwelling urinary catheter inserted (Option C). The nurse should provide skin care as soon as the patient is inconti-nent to prevent skin maceration and breakdown, not just every 4 hours (Option D). 150. Correct answer: D The patient with a spinal cord injury should recognize fever and change in the clarity of urine as early indications of a UTI. Lower back pain (Option A) is a late sign. The patient with a spinal cord injury may not have burning or frequency of urination (Options B and C).Answers and rationales the number of incorrect responses to the posttest.
