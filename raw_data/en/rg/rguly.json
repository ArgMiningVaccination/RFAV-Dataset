Building a strong spiritual foundation helps us to achieve an overall life balance. But how do we know if we are on the right track? Meditation, self-help books, and positive affirmations are all great tools, but it can be difficult to take care of our selves consistently in the midst of a busy life. This spiritual health quiz will reveal just how connected you are to your source, and will also pinpoint areas that might need extra attention. Please give each question a \"True or False\" answer. Try to be as honest with yourself as you can. You will gain the most benefits from a true self-assessment. Commit to something spiritual that you can do regularly. Meditation and guided visualization are both useful options that will help you to connect with your source. You might enjoy praying for a few minutes each morning, or perhaps reading from an inspirational book each evening before bed will do the trick. Regardless of what you do, carving out time to connect with your soul is imperative. On the other hand, if you find yourself surrounded by people who frequently gossip, this will ultimately affect your self-esteem and even your manifesting ability. Gossip carries an inherent energy of judgment, which ends up leaking onto us. While it may feel momentarily fun to pick apart someone's choice of outfit, this tells the universe that we are also open to receiving this kind of criticism. People who are consistently negative will pull you away from your center. While it may not be realistic to avoid certain people (like family members or work associates), a spiritually balanced person knows not to actively engage in this energy just to make others feel better. Find a circle of people who inspire you to be better. Even if we are generally positive, poverty consciousness can also be imposed on us by other people. An example of this would be a friend who believes that there are no opportunities for love, abundance or good fortune. They often call their outlook as \"being realistic,\" but in truth it is simply a way for them to avoid disappointment. It is natural to want to identify with others, but whether we know it or not, we naturally take on their energy. Again, you may not be able to completely avoid these people, but you do not have to engage in their energy by agreeing with them. No one is expecting you to be positive 100% of the time, but you should always be open to the possibility of wonderful surprises in your life. What kind of experiences would you like to have in this life? How do you want to feel? What are you trying to achieve? While it is important to be flexible and open to adjusting your goals as you go, we must first claim our intention. Becoming clear in our hearts will start us on the process of becoming who we are meant to be. If you are struggling in any area of your life, try to look to other people who inspire you. For example, if your love life is difficult, ask a friend who is in a happy relationship for advice about behaviors that you could change to attract love. Whatever the topic, make sure that your source of guidance is someone that is a living example of the life that you want. The best way to counteract the social media blues is to take regular breaks from it. You should ideally have at least one day each week where you do not check social media at all. Or, block out a specific number of hours each day where you are completely logged off from the virtual world. This disconnection will encourage you to reach out and engage with the real, physical world out there. And for those of you who use social media to promote your business, fret not. There are many useful apps that can be used to pre-plan posts so that you can relax on your days off. It is also worth noting that most news outlets skew towards negative stories. This is because the most negative, violent reports tend to get the highest ratings and clicks online. Just like when drivers slow down to gawk at a car accident, it is human nature to be drawn into negative stories. But we have the choice of whether or not to feed this energy. While it is important to stay abreast of current events, it is critical to take regular breaks from the news to reconnect with your center. Try to pick at least one day per week when you do not watch or absorb any kind of news. If you can avoid TV news entirely, that would be best. Reading news online or in print is better because it allows you to use your own voice. There are countless ways to acknowledge mini-miracles in our day. Whether it's a friend buying you brunch, pulling up to a parking meter with more than enough time left, or the way the light hits your living room in the middle of a Sunday, taking note of mini-miracles lifts our mood and attracts more to us. Results: Give yourself one point for each \"True\" response. 6-8 True Answers: Awesome! Your spiritual center is strongly rooted and helping you along your journey. You know when to check in with yourself, seek guidance from others, and disconnect from patterns that pull you from your center. Best of all, you inspire others with your positive energy! The most powerful way to increase your good mojo is to help loved ones who could use a boost. You are a beacon of light that can lift those around you. 3-5 True Answers: Congratulations! You have a grounded consciousness about you that helps in all situations. You are good at checking in with yourself, but sometimes you put the needs of others first. This is noble, but is ultimately not going to serve you or your loved ones. Your best course of action is to review the items that you answered \"false\" to and make them a priority this week. 1-2 True Answers: Good Job! You are aware that there is a better way to live, and are open to finding it. However, it can be a struggle to choose love over other paths. We live in particularly complicated times, with all sorts of \"noise\" that can distort our sense of spiritual balance. The most important thing you can do right now is give yourself the room to do make changes that will help you going forward. Life is a work in progress, and you are worth investing in yourself. Go back over this list and see which areas seem to need the most attention. If you find yourself struggling to remain grateful, you may want to have a daily focus on mini-miracles. Or if you are one of the many people who spend the majority of their day online, you will want to experiment with cutting that down. The fact that you took this quiz in the first place says that your consciousness is asking for a greater connection to spirit. "}
