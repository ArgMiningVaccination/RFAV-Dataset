Sponsor ed and administer ed by : The Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association and participating Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans Who may enr oll in this Plan : All Federal employees, T ribal employees, and annuitants who are eligible to enroll in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program Enr ollment codes for this Plan: 104 Standard Option - Self Only 106 Standard Option - Self Plus One 105 Standard Option - Self and Family 1 1 1 Basic Option - Self Only 1 13 Basic Option - Self Plus One 1 12 Basic Option - Self and Family RI 71-005 Important Notice fr om the Blue Cr oss and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan About Our Pr escription Drug Coverage and Medicar e The Of fice of Personnel Management (OPM) has determined that the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan' s prescription drug coverage is, on average, expected to pay out as much as the standard Medicare prescription drug coverage will pay for all plan participants and is considered Creditable Coverage. This means you do not need to enroll in Medicare Part D and pay extra for prescription drug coverage. If you decide to enroll in Medicare Part D later , you will not have to pay a penalty for late enrollment as long as you keep your FEHB coverage. However , if you choose to enroll in Medicare Part D, you can keep your FEHB coverage and your FEHB plan will coordinate benefits with Medicare. Remember: If you are an annuitant and you cancel your FEHB coverage, you may not re-enroll in the FEHB Program. Please be advised If you lose or drop your FEHB coverage and go 63 days or longer without prescription drug coverage that is at least as good as Medicare' s prescription drug coverage, your monthly Medicare Part D premium will go up at least 1 percent per month for every month that you did not have that coverage. For example, if you go 19 months without Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage, your premium will always be at least 19% higher than what many other people pay . Y ou will have to pay this higher premium as long as you have Medicare prescription drug coverage. In addition, you may have to wait until the next Annual Coordinated Election Period (October 15 through December 7) to enroll in Medicare Part D. Medicar e' s Low Income Benefits For people with limited income and resources, extra help paying for a Medicare prescription drug plan is available. Information regarding this program is available through the Social Security Administration (SSA) online at www .socialsecurity .gov , or call the SSA at 800-772-1213, TTY : 71 1.

While death is the most tragic outcome, medical mistakes cause other problems such as permanent disabilities, extended hospital stays, longer recoveries, and additional treatments. Medical mistakes and their consequences also add significantly to the overall cost of healthcare. Hospitals and healthcare providers are being held accountable for the quality of care and reduction in medical mistakes by their accrediting bodies. Y ou can also improve the quality and safety of your own healthcare and that of your family members by learning more about and understanding your risks. T ake these simple steps: 1. Ask questions if you have doubts or concerns. Ask questions and make sure you understand the answers. Choose a doctor with whom you feel comfortable talking. T ake a relative or friend with you to help you take notes, ask questions and understand answers. 2. Keep and bring a list of all the medications you take. Bring the actual medications or give your doctor and pharmacist a list of all the medications and dosages that you take, including non-prescription (over -the-counter) medications and nutritional supplements. T ell your doctor and pharmacist about any drug, food, and other aller gies you have, such as to latex. Ask about any risks or side ef fects of the medication and what to avoid while taking it. Be sure to write down what your doctor or pharmacist says. Make sure your medication is what the doctor ordered. Ask the pharmacist about your medication if it looks dif ferent than you expected. Read the label and patient package insert when you get your medication, including all warnings and instructions. Know how to use your medication. Especially note the times and conditions when your medication should and should not be taken. Contact your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. Understand both the generic and brand names of your medication. This helps ensure you do not receive double dosing from taking both a generic and a brand. It also helps prevent you from taking a medication to which you are aller gic. 6 2023 Blue Cross\u00ae and Blue Shield\u00ae Service Benefit Plan Introduction/Plain Language/Advisory 3.

Pr eventable Healthcar e Acquir ed Conditions (\"Never Events\") When you enter the hospital for treatment of one medical problem, you do not expect to leave with additional injuries, infections, or other serious conditions that occur during the course of your stay . Although some of these complications may not be avoidable, patients do suf fer from injuries or illnesses that could have been prevented if doctors or the hospital had taken proper precautions. Errors in medical care that are clearly identifiable, preventable and serious in their consequences for patients can indicate a significant problem in the safety and credibility of a healthcare facility . These conditions and errors are sometimes called \"Never Events\" or \"Serious Reportable Events.\" W e have a benefit payment policy that encourages hospitals to reduce the likelihood of hospital-acquired conditions such as certain infections, severe bedsores, and fractures, and to reduce medical errors that should never happen.

If this law applies to you, you must enroll in Self Plus One or Self and Family coverage in a health plan that provides full benefits in the area where your children live or provide documentation to your employing of fice that you have obtained other health benefits coverage for your children. If you do not do so, your employing of fice will enroll you involuntarily as follows: If you have no FEHB coverage, your employing of fice will enroll you for Self Plus One or Self and Family coverage, as appropriate, in the lowest-cost nationwide Plan option as determined by OPM. Childr en' s Equity Act 10 2023 Blue Cross\u00ae and Blue Shield\u00ae Service Benefit Plan FEHB Facts If you have a Self Only enrollment in a fee-for -service plan or in an HMO that serves the area where your children live, your employing of fice will change your enrollment to Self Plus One or Self and Family , as appropriate, in the same option of the same plan; or If you are enrolled in an HMO that does not serve the area where the children live, your employing of fice will change your enrollment to Self Plus One or Self and Family , as appropriate, in the lowest-cost nationwide plan option as determined by OPM.

However , if you changed from another FEHB plan to us, your former plan will pay for the hospital stay until: you are dischar ged, not merely moved to an alternative care center; the day your benefits from your former plan run out; or the 92nd day after you become a member of this Plan, whichever happens first. If you ar e hospitalized when your enr ollment begins 20 2023 Blue Cross\u00ae and Blue Shield\u00ae Service Benefit Plan Section 3 These provisions apply only to the benefits of the hospitalized person. If your plan terminates participation in the FEHB in whole or in part, or if OPM orders an enrollment change, this continuation of coverage provision does not apply . In such cases, the hospitalized family member ' s benefits under the new plan begin on the ef fective date of enrollment. The pre-service claim approval processes for inpatient hospital admissions (called precertification) and for Other services (called prior approval) are detailed in this Section. A pr e-service claim is any claim, in whole or in part, that requires approval from us before you receive medical care or services. In other words, a pre-service claim for benefits may require precertification and prior approval. If you do not obtain precertification, there may be a reduction or denial of benefits. Be sure to read all of the precertification and prior approval information below and on pages 22-26. Our FEP medical policies may be found by visiting www .fepblue.or g/policies. Y ou need prior Plan appr oval for certain services Pr ecertification is the process by which - prior to your inpatient admission - we evaluate the medical necessity of your proposed stay , the procedure(s)/service(s) to be performed, the number of days required to treat your condition, and any applicable benefit criteria. Unless we are misled by the information given to us, we will not change our decision on medical necessity . In most cases, your physician or facility will take care of requesting precertification. Because you are still responsible for ensuring that your care is precertified, you should always ask your physician, hospital, inpatient residential treatment center , or skilled nursing facility whether or not they have contacted us and provided all necessary information. Y ou may contact us at the phone number on the back of your ID card to ask if we have received the request for precertification. Y ou are also responsible for enrolling in case management and working with your case manager if your care involves residential treatment or a skilled nursing facility . For information about precertification of an emer gency inpatient hospital admission, please see page 26. Inpatient hospital admission, inpatient r esidential tr eatment center admission, or skilled nursing facility admission W e will reduce our benefits for the inpatient hospital stay by $500, even if you have obtained prior approval for the service or procedure being performed during the stay , if no one contacts us for precertification. If the stay is not medically necessary , we will not provide benefits for inpatient hospital room and board or inpatient physician care; we will only pay for covered medical services and supplies that are otherwise payable on an outpatient basis. Note: If precertification was not obtained prior to admission, inpatient benefits (such as room and board) are not available for inpatient care at a residential treatment center , or , when Medicare Part A is not the primary payor , at a skilled nursing facility . W e will pay only for covered medical services and supplies that are otherwise payable on an outpatient basis. W arning: Y ou do not need precertification in these cases: Y ou are admitted to a hospital outside the United States; with the exception of admissions for gender af firming sur gery and admissions to residential treatment centers, and skilled nursing facilities. Y ou have another group health insurance policy that is the primary payor for the hospital stay; with the exception of admissions for gender af firming sur gery . (See page 76 for special instructions regarding admissions to Blue Distinction Centers for T ransplants.) Medicare Part A is the primary payor for the hospital or skilled nursing facility stay; with the exception of admissions for gender af firming sur gery . (See page 76 for special instructions regarding admissions to Blue Distinction Centers for T ransplants.) Note: If you exhaust your Medicare hospital benefits and do not want to use your Medicare lifetime reserve days, then you do need precertification. Note: Morbid obesity sur gery performed during an inpatient stay (even when Medicare Part A is your primary payor) must meet the sur gical requirements described on pages 64-65 in order for benefits to be provided for the admission and sur gical procedure. Exceptions: 21 2023 Blue Cross\u00ae and Blue Shield\u00ae Service Benefit Plan Section 3 Y ou must obtain prior appr oval for these services under both Standard and Basic Option in all outpatient and inpatient settings unless otherwise noted.

Non-urgent car e claims If you have an urgent car e claim (i.e., when waiting for your medical care or treatment could seriously jeopardize your life, health, or ability to regain maximum function, or in the opinion of a physician with knowledge of your medical condition, would subject you to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without this care or treatment), we will expedite our review of the claim and notify you of our decision within 72 hours as long as we receive suf ficient information to complete the review . (For concurrent care claims that are also ur gent care claims, please see If your treatment needs to be extended on page 27.) If you request that we review your claim as an ur gent care claim, we will review the documentation you provide and decide whether or not it is an ur gent care claim by applying the judgment of a prudent layperson who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine. If you fail to provide suf ficient information, we will contact you within 24 hours after we receive the claim to let you know what information we need to complete our review of the claim. Y ou will then have up to 48 hours to provide the required information. W e will make our decision on the claim within 48 hours of (1) the time we received the additional information or (2) the end of the time frame, whichever is earlier . Urgent car e claims 25 2023 Blue Cross\u00ae and Blue Shield\u00ae Service Benefit Plan Section 3 W e may provide our decision orally within these time frames, but we will follow up with written or electronic notification within three days of oral notification.

Y ou may also call OPM' s FEHB 1 at 202-606-0727 between 8 a.m. and 5 p. m. Eastern T ime (excluding holidays) to ask for the simultaneous review . W e will cooperate with OPM so they can quickly review your claim on appeal. In addition, if you did not indicate that your claim was a claim for ur gent care, call us at the phone number listed on the back of your ID card. If it is determined that your claim is an ur gent care claim, we will expedite our review (if we have not yet responded to your claim). A concurrent care claim involves care provided over a period of time or over a number of treatments. W e will treat any reduction or termination of our pre-approved course of treatment before the end of the approved period of time or number of treatments as an appealable decision. This does not include reduction or termination due to benefit changes or if your enrollment ends. If we believe a reduction or termination is warranted, we will allow you suf ficient time to appeal and obtain a decision from us before the reduction or termination takes ef fect.

If you do not phone us within two business days, a $500 penalty may apply - see W arning under Inpatient hospital admissions earlier in this Section and If your facility stay needs to be extended below . Admissions to r esidential tr eatment centers do not qualify as emergencies. Emergency inpatient admission Y ou do not need precertification of a maternity admission for a routine delivery . However , if your medical condition requires you to stay more than 48 hours after a vaginal delivery or 96 hours after a cesarean section, your physician or the hospital must contact us for precertification of additional days. Further , if your newborn stays after you are dischar ged, then your physician or the hospital must contact us for precertification of additional days for your newborn. Note: When a newborn requires definitive treatment during or after the mother ' s confinement, the newborn is considered a patient in their own right. If the newborn is eligible for coverage, regular medical or sur gical benefits apply rather than maternity benefits. Maternity car e If your hospital stay - including for maternity care - needs to be extended, you, your representative, your physician, or the hospital must ask us to approve the additional days. If you remain in the hospital beyond the number of days we approved and did not get the additional days precertified, then: for the part of the admission that was medically necessary , we will pay inpatient benefits, but for the part of the admission that was not medically necessary , we will pay only medical services and supplies otherwise payable on an outpatient basis and we will not pay inpatient benefits. If your r esidential tr eatment center stay needs to be extended, you, your representative, your physician or the residential treatment center must ask us to approve the additional days. If you remain in the residential treatment center beyond the number of days approved and did not get the additional days precertified, we will provide benefits for medically necessary covered services, other than room and board and inpatient physician care, at the level we would have paid if they had been provided on an outpatient basis. If your facility stay needs to be extended 26 2023 Blue Cross\u00ae and Blue Shield\u00ae Service Benefit Plan Section 3 If you request an extension of an ongoing course of treatment at least 24 hours prior to the expiration of the approved time period and this is also an ur gent care claim, we will make a decision within 24 hours after we receive the claim. If your tr eatment needs to be extended If you have a pr e-service claim and you do not agree with our decision regarding precertification of an inpatient admission or prior approval of Other services , you may request a review by following the procedures listed below . Note that these procedures apply to requests for reconsideration of concurrent care claims as well (see page 152 for definition). (If you have already received the service, supply , or treatment, then your claim is a post-service claim and you must follow the entire disputed claims process detailed in Section 8.) If you disagr ee with our pr e-service claim decision W ithin 6 months of our initial decision, you may ask us in writing to reconsider our initial decision. Follow Step 1 of the disputed claims process detailed in Section 8 of this brochure.

Y our Costs for Cover ed Services This is what you will pay out-of-pocket for your covered care: Cost-share or cost-sharing is the general term used to refer to your out-of-pocket costs (e.g., deductible, coinsurance, and copayments) for the covered care you receive. Note: Y ou may have to pay the deductible, coinsurance, and/or copayment amount(s) that apply to your care at the time you receive the services. Cost-shar e/Cost- sharing A copayment is a fixed amount of money you pay to the provider , facility , pharmacy , etc., when you receive certain services. Example: If you have Standard Option when you see your Preferred physician, you pay a copayment of $25 for the of fice visit, and we then pay the remainder of the amount we allow for the of fice visit. (Y ou may have to pay separately for other services you receive while in the physician' s of fice.) When you go into a Preferred hospital, you pay a copayment of $350 per admission. W e then pay the remainder of the amount we allow for the covered services you receive. Copayments do not apply to services and supplies that are subject to a deductible and/or coinsurance amount. Note: If the billed amount (or the Plan allowance that providers we contract with have agreed to accept as payment in full) is less than your copayment, you pay the lower amount. Note: When multiple copayment services are performed by the same professional or facility provider on the same day , only one copayment applies per provider per day . When the copayment amounts are dif ferent, the highest copayment is applicable. Y ou may be responsible for a separate copayment for some services. Example: If you have Basic Option when you visit the outpatient department of a Preferred hospital for non-emer gency treatment services, your copayment is $150 (see page 81). If you also receive an ultrasound in the outpatient department of the same hospital on the same day , you will not be responsible for the $40 copayment for the ultrasound (shown on page 83). Copayment A deductible is a fixed amount of covered expenses you must incur for certain covered services and supplies before we start paying benefits for them. Copayments and coinsurance amounts do not count toward your deductible. When a covered service or supply is subject to a deductible, only the Plan allowance for the service or supply that you then pay counts toward meeting your deductible. Under Standard Option , the calendar year deductible is $350 per person. After the deductible amount is satisfied for an individual, covered services are payable for that individual. Under a Self Plus One enrollment, both family members must meet the individual deductible. Under a Self and Family enrollment, an individual may meet the individual deductible, or all family members' individual deductibles are considered to be satisfied when the family members' deductibles are combined and reach $700. Note: If the billed amount (or the Plan allowance that providers we contract with have agreed to accept as payment in full) is less than the remaining portion of your deductible, you pay the lower amount. Example: If the billed amount is $100, the provider has an agreement with us to accept $80, and you have not paid any amount toward meeting your Standard Option calendar year deductible, you must pay $80. W e will apply $80 to your deductible. W e will begin paying benefits once the remaining portion of your Standard Option calendar year deductible ($270) has been satisfied. Note: If you change plans during Open Season and the ef fective date of your new plan is after January 1 of the next year , you do not have to start a new deductible under your prior plan between January 1 and the ef fective date of your new plan. If you change plans at another time during the year , you must begin a new deductible under your new plan. Under Basic Option , there is no calendar year deductible . Deductible 28 2023 Blue Cross\u00ae and Blue Shield\u00ae Service Benefit Plan Section 4 Coinsurance is the percentage of the Plan allowance that you must pay for your care. Y our coinsurance is based on the Plan allowance, or billed amount, whichever is less. Under Standard Option only , coinsurance does not begin until you have met your calendar year deductible. See Section 5(i) for information about the deductible and overseas benefits. Example: Y ou pay 15% of the Plan allowance under Standard Option for durable medical equipment obtained from a Preferred provider , after meeting your $350 calendar year deductible. Coinsurance Note: If your pr ovider r outinely waives (does not require you to pay) your applicable deductible (under Standard Option only), coinsurance, or copayments, the provider is misstating the fee and may be violating the law . In this case, when we calculate our share, we will reduce the provider ' s fee by the amount waived. Example: If your physician ordinarily char ges $100 for a service but routinely waives your 35% Standard Option coinsurance, the actual char ge is $65. W e will pay $42.25 (65% of the actual char ge of $65). If your pr ovider r outinely waives your cost In some instances, a Preferred, Participating, or Member provider may ask you to sign a \"waiver\" prior to receiving care. This waiver may state that you accept responsibility for the total char ge for any care that is not covered by your health plan. If you sign such a waiver , whether or not you are responsible for the total char ge depends on the contracts that the Local Plan has with its providers. If you are asked to sign this type of waiver , please be aware that, if benefits are denied for the services, you could be legally liable for the related expenses. If you would like more information about waivers, please contact us at the customer service phone number on the back of your ID card. W aivers Our \" Plan allowance \" is the amount we use to calculate our payment for certain types of covered services. Fee-for -service plans arrive at their allowances in dif ferent ways, so allowances vary . For information about how we determine our Plan allowance, see the definition of Plan allowance in Section 10. Often, the provider ' s bill is more than a fee-for -service plan' s allowance. It is possible for a provider ' s bill to exceed the plan' s allowance by a significant amount. Whether or not you have to pay the dif ference between our allowance and the bill will depend on the type of provider you use. Providers that have agreements with this Plan are Preferred or Participating and will not bill you for any balances that are in excess of our allowance for covered services. See the descriptions appearing below for the types of providers available in this Plan. Pr eferr ed pr oviders . These types of providers have agreements with the Local Plan to limit what they bill our members. Because of that, when you use a Preferred provider , your share of the provider ' s bill for covered care is limited. Under Standard Option , your share consists only of your deductible and coinsurance or copayment. Here is an example about coinsurance: Y ou see a Preferred physician who char ges $250, but our allowance is $100. If you have met your deductible, you are only responsible for your coinsurance. That is, under Standard Option, you pay just 15% of our $100 allowance ($15). Because of the agreement, your Preferred physician will not bill you for the $150 dif ference between our allowance and the bill. Under Basic Option , your share consists only of your copayment or coinsurance amount, since there is no calendar year deductible. Here is an example involving a copayment: Y ou see a Preferred physician who char ges $250 for covered services subject to a $30 copayment. Even though our allowance may be $100, you still pay just the $30 copayment. Because of the agreement, your Preferred physician will not bill you for the $220 dif ference between your copayment and the bill. Remember , under Basic Option, you must use Pr eferr ed pr oviders in order to r eceive benefits. See page 20 for the exceptions to this requirement. Differ ences between our allowance and the bill 29 2023 Blue Cross\u00ae and Blue Shield\u00ae Service Benefit Plan Section 4 Participating pr oviders. These types of Non-pr eferr ed providers have agreements with the Local Plan to limit what they bill our members. Under Standard Option , when you use a Participating provider , your share of covered char ges consists only of your deductible and coinsurance or copayment. Here is an example: Y ou see a Participating physician who char ges $250, but the Plan allowance is $100. If you have met your deductible, you are only responsible for your coinsurance. That is, under Standard Option, you pay just 35% of our $100 allowance ($35). Because of the agreement, your Participating physician will not bill you for the $150 dif ference between our allowance and the bill. Under Basic Option, ther e ar e no benefits for car e performed by Participating pr oviders; you pay all charges. See page 20 for the exceptions to this requirement. Non-participating pr oviders. These Non-pr eferr ed pr oviders have no agreement to limit what they will bill you. As a result, your share of the provider ' s bill could be significantly more than what you would pay for covered care from a Preferred provider . If you plan to use a Non-participating provider for your care, we encourage you to ask the provider about the expected costs and visit our website, www .fepblue.or g, or call us at the customer service phone number on the back of your ID card for assistance in estimating your total out-of-pocket expenses. Under Standard Option , when you use a Non-participating provider , you will pay your deductible and coinsurance - plus any dif ference between our allowance and the char ges on the bill (except in certain circumstances - see pages 156-158). For example, you see a Non-participating physician who char ges $250. The Plan allowance is again $100, and you have met your deductible. Y ou are responsible for your coinsurance, so you pay 35% of the $100 Plan allowance or $35. Plus, because there is no agreement between the Non-participating physician and us, the physician can bill you for the $150 dif ference between our allowance and the bill. This means you would pay a total of $185 ($35 + $150) for the Non-participating physician' s services, rather than $15 for the same services when performed by a Preferred physician. W e encourage you to always visit Pr eferr ed pr oviders for your car e. Using Non-participating or Non-member pr oviders could r esult in your having to pay significantly gr eater amounts for the services you r eceive. Under Basic Option, ther e ar e no benefits for car e performed by Non-participating pr oviders; you pay all charges. See page 20 for the exceptions to this requirement. The following examples illustrate how much Standard Option members have to pay out-of-pocket for services performed by Preferred providers, Participating/Member providers, and Non-participating/ Non-member providers. The first example shows services provided by a physician and the second example shows facility care billed by an ambulatory sur gical facility . In both examples, your calendar year deductible has already been met. Use this information for illustrative purposes only . Basic Option benefit levels for physician care begin on page 39; see page 81 for Basic Option benefit levels that apply to outpatient hospital or ambulatory sur gical facility care. In the following example, we compare how much you have to pay out-of-pocket for services provided by a Preferred physician, a Participating physician, and a Non-participating physician. The table uses our example of a service for which the physician char ges $250 and the Plan allowance is $100. 30 2023 Blue Cross\u00ae and Blue Shield\u00ae Service Benefit Plan Section 4 EXAMPLE Pr eferr ed Physician Standard Option Physician's char ge: $250 Our allowance: W e set it at: 100 W e pay: 85% of our allowance: 85 Y ou owe: of our Y ou applicable +Dif ference up to char ge?: No: 0 T OT AL YOU P A Y : $15 Participating Physician Standard Option Physician's char ge: $250 Our allowance: W e set it at: 100 W e pay: 65% of our allowance: 65 Y ou owe: of our Y ou applicable +Dif ference up to char ge?: No: 0 T OT AL YOU P A Y : $35 Non-participating Physician Standard Option Physician's char ge: $250 Our allowance: W e set it at: 100 W e pay: 65% of our allowance: 65 Y ou owe: of our Y ou applicable +Dif ference up to char ge?: Y es: 150 T OT AL YOU P A Y : $185 Note: If you had not met any of your Standard Option deductible in the above example, only our allowance ($100), which you would pay in full, would count toward your deductible. Y ou should also see section Important Notice About Surprise Billing - Know Y our Rights on page 32 that describes your protections against surprise billing under the No Surprises Act. In the following example, we compare how much you have to pay out-of-pocket for services billed by a Preferred, Member , and Non-member ambulatory sur gical facility for facility care associated with an outpatient sur gical procedure. The table uses an example of services for which the ambulatory sur gical facility char ges $5,000. The Plan allowance is $2,900 when the services are provided at a Preferred or Member facility , and the Plan allowance is $2,500 when the services are provided at a Non-member facility .

Y ou ar e r esponsible for paying all expenses over our allowance, r egardless of the total amount billed, in addition to your calendar year deductible and coinsurance. For example, if you use a Non-member facility that charges $60,000 for facility car e r elated to outpatient bariatric surgery , and we pay the $1,625 amount illustrated above, you would owe $58,375 ($60,000 - $1,625 = $58,375). This example assumes your calendar year deductible has been met. The No Surprises Act (NSA) is a federal law that provides you with protections against \"surprise billing\" and \"balance billing\" under certain circumstances. A surprise bill is an unexpected bill you receive from a Non-participating healthcare provider , facility , or air ambulance service for healthcare. Surprise bills can happen when you receive emer gency care - when you have little or no say in the facility or provider from whom you receive care. They can also happen when you received non- emer gency services at participating facilities, but you receive some care from Non-participating providers. Balance billing happens when you receive a bill from the non-participating provider , facility , or air ambulance service for the dif ference between the Non-participating provider ' s char ge and the amount payable by your health plan. Y our health plan must comply with the NSA protections that hold you harmless from unexpected bills. For specific information on surprise billing, the rights and protections you have, and your responsibilities go to www .fepblue.or g/NSA or contact the customer service phone number on the back of your ID card.

When your eligible out-of-pocket expenses reach this catastrophic protection maximum, you no longer have to pay the associated cost- sharing amounts for the rest of the calendar year . For Self Plus One and Self and Family enrollments, once any individual family member reaches the Self Only catastrophic protection out-of-pocket maximum during the calendar year , that member ' s claims will no longer be subject to associated cost- sharing amounts for the rest of the year . All other family members will be required to meet the balance of the catastrophic protection out-of-pocket maximum.

Y ou should be aware that some Non-preferred (non-PPO) professional providers may provide services in Preferred (PPO) facilities. W e provide benefits at Preferred benefit levels for emer gency room services performed by both PPO and non-PPO providers when their services are related to an accidental injury or medical emer gency . The Plan allowance for these services is determined by the contracting status of the provider . If services are performed by non-PPO professional providers in a PPO facility , you will be responsible for your cost-share for those services. For more information, see page 32, NSA. PPO benefits apply only when you use a PPO provider (except as described above). When no PPO provider is available, non-PPO benefits apply .

Refer to the guidelines appearing below for additional information. What is an accidental injury? An accidental injury is an injury caused by an external force or element such as a blow or fall and which requires immediate medical attention, including animal bites and poisonings. (See Section 5(g) for dental care for accidental injury .) What is a medical emergency? A medical emer gency is the sudden and unexpected onset of a condition or an injury that you believe endangers your life or could result in serious injury or disability , and requires immediate medical or sur gical care. Some problems are emer gencies because, if not treated promptly , they might become more serious; examples include deep cuts and broken bones. Others are emer gencies because they are potentially life threatening, such as heart attacks, strokes, poisonings, gunshot wounds, or sudden inability to breathe. There are many other acute conditions that we may determine are medical emer gencies - what they all have in common is the need for quick action. Basic Option benefits for emergency car e Under Basic Option, you are encouraged to seek care from Preferred providers in cases of accidental injury or medical emer gency . However , if you need care immediately and cannot access a Preferred provider , we will provide benefits for the initial treatment provided in the emer gency room of any hospital - even if the hospital is not a Preferred facility . W e will also provide benefits if you are admitted directly to the hospital from the emer gency room until your condition has been stabilized. In addition, we will provide benefits for emer gency ambulance transportation provided by Preferred or Non-preferred ambulance providers if the transport is due to a medical emer gency or accidental injury . W e provide emer gency benefits when you have acute symptoms of suf ficient severity - including severe pain - such that a prudent layperson, who possesses average knowledge of health and medicine, could reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical attention to result in serious jeopardy to the person' s health, or with respect to a pregnant member , the health of the member and their unborn child. 94 2023 Blue Cross\u00ae and Blue Shield\u00ae Service Benefit Plan Standard and Basic Option Section 5(d) Standard and Basic Option Benefit Description Y ou Pay Note: For Standard Option, we state whether or not the calendar year deductible applies for each benefit listed in this Section.

See pages 1 14-1 15 for information about your cost-share for specialty drugs purchased at a Preferred retail pharmacy that are af fected by these restrictions. 104 2023 Blue Cross\u00ae and Blue Shield\u00ae Service Benefit Plan Standard and Basic Option Section 5(f) Standard and Basic Option What is cover ed. Under Basic Option, we use a managed formulary for certain drug classes. If you purchase a drug in a class included in the managed formulary that is not on the managed formulary , you will pay the full cost of that drug since that drug is not covered under your benefit. Under Standard Option and Basic Option Note: Both formularies include lists of preferred drugs that are safe, ef fective and appropriate for our members, and are available at lower costs than non-preferred drugs. If your physician prescribed a more expensive non-preferred drug for you, we may ask that he or she prescribe a preferred drug instead; we encourage you to do the same. If you purchase a drug that is not on our preferred drug list, your cost will be higher . Y our cooperation with our cost-savings ef forts helps keep your premium af fordable. Note: Some drugs, nutritional supplements, and supplies are not covered (see pages 1 18-1 19); we may also exclude certain U.S. FDA-approved drugs when multiple generic equivalents/alternative medications are available. If you purchase a drug, nutritional supplement, or supply that is not covered, you will be responsible for the full cost of the item. Note: Befor e filling your pr escription, please check the pr eferr ed/non-pr eferr ed status of the drug. Other than changes resulting from new drugs or safety issues, the preferred drug list is updated periodically during the year . Changes to the preferred drug list are not considered benefit changes. Note: Member cost-share for prescription drugs is determined by the tier to which a drug has been assigned. T o determine the tier assignments for formulary drugs, we work with our Pharmacy and Medical Policy Committee, a group of physicians and pharmacists who are not employees or agents of, nor have financial interest in, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan. The Committee meets quarterly to review new and existing drugs to assist us in our assessment. Drugs determined to be of equal therapeutic value and similar safety and ef ficacy are then evaluated on the basis of cost. The Committee' s recommendations, together with our evaluation of the relative cost of the drugs, determine the placement of formulary drugs on a specific tier . Using lower cost preferred drugs will provide you with a high-quality , cost-ef fective prescription drug benefit. Our payment levels are generally categorized as: T ier 1: Includes generic drugs T ier 2: Includes preferred brand-name drugs T ier 3: Includes non-preferred brand-name drugs T ier 4: Includes preferred specialty drugs T ier 5: Includes non-preferred specialty drugs Y ou can view both the Standard Option and Basic Option formularies, which include the preferred drug list for each, on our website at www .fepblue.or g or call 800-624-5060, TTY : 71 1, for assistance. Changes to the formulary are not considered benefit changes. Any savings we receive on the cost of drugs purchased under this Plan from drug manufacturers are credited to the reserves held for this Plan. Generic equivalents Generic equivalent drugs have the same active ingredients as their brand-name equivalents. By filling your prescriptions (or those of family members covered by the Plan) at a retail pharmacy , through the Specialty Drug Pharmacy Program, or , for Standard Option members and for Basic Option members with primary Medicare Part B, through the Mail Service Prescription Drug Program, you authorize the pharmacist to substitute any available U.S. FDA-approved generic equivalent, unless you or your physician specifically requests a brand-name drug and indicates \"dispense as written.\" Keep in mind that Basic Option members must use Pr eferr ed pr oviders in order to r eceive benefits. See Section 10, Definitions , page 154, for more information about generic alternatives and generic equivalents. Disclosure of information. As part of our administration of prescription drug benefits, we may disclose information about your prescription drug utilization, including the names of your prescribing physicians, to any treating physicians or dispensing pharmacies. 105 2023 Blue Cross\u00ae and Blue Shield\u00ae Service Benefit Plan Standard and Basic Option Section 5(f) Standard and Basic Option These ar e the dispensing limitations. Standard Option: Subject to manufacturer packaging and your prescriber ' s instructions, you may purchase up to a 90-day supply of covered drugs and supplies through the Retail Pharmacy Program. Y ou may purchase a supply of mor e than 21 days up to 90 days through the Mail Service Prescription Drug Program for a single copayment. Basic Option: When you fill T ier 1 (generic), T ier 2 (preferred brand-name), and T ier 3 (non-preferred brand-name) prescriptions at a Preferred retail pharmacy , you may purchase up to a 30-day supply for a single copayment, or up to a 90-day supply for additional copayments unless otherwise noted. Members with primary Medicare Part B coverage may purchase a supply of mor e than 21 days up to 90 days through the Mail Service Prescription Drug Program for a single copayment. Under Standard Option and Basic Option Benefits for T ier 4 and T ier 5 specialty drugs purchased at a retail pharmacy are limited to one purchase of up to a 30-day supply for each prescription dispensed. All refills must be obtained through the Specialty Drug Pharmacy Program. Benefits for the first three fills of each T ier 4 or T ier 5 specialty drug are limited to a 30-day supply . Benefits are available for a 90-day supply after the third fill of the specialty drug. See page 1 16 for more information. Note: Certain drugs such as narcotics may have additional limits or requirements as established by the U.S. FDA or by national scientific or medical practice guidelines (such as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Medical Association, etc.) on the quantities that a pharmacy may dispense. In addition, pharmacy dispensing practices are regulated by the state where they are located and may also be determined by individual pharmacies. Due to safety requirements, some medications are dispensed as originally packaged by the manufacturer and we cannot make adjustments to the packaged quantity or otherwise open or split packages to create 22, 30, and 90-day supplies of those medications. In most cases, r efills cannot be obtained until 75% of the pr escription has been used. Contr olled substances cannot be r efilled until 80% of the pr escription has been used. Controlled substances are medications that can cause physical and mental dependence, and have restrictions on how they can be filled and refilled. They are regulated and classified by the DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) based on how likely they are to cause dependence. Call us or visit our website if you have any questions about dispensing limits. Please note that in the event of a national or other emer gency , or if you are a reservist or National Guard member who is called to active military duty , you should contact us regarding your prescription drug needs. See the contact information below . Note: Benefits for certain self-injectable (self-administered) drugs are provided only when they are dispensed by a pharmacy under the pharmacy benefit. Medical benefits will be provided for a once-per -lifetime dose per therapeutic category of drugs dispensed by your provider or any non-pharmacy-benefit provider .

Patient Safety and Quality Monitoring (PSQM) W e have a special program to promote patient safety and monitor healthcare quality . Our Patient Safety and Quality Monitoring (PSQM) program features a set of closely aligned programs that are designed to promote the safe and appropriate use of medications. Examples of these programs include: Prior approval - As described on page 107, this program requires that approval be obtained for certain prescription drugs and supplies before we provide benefits for them. Safety checks - Before your prescription is filled, we perform quality and safety checks for usage precautions, drug interactions, drug duplication, excessive use, and frequency of refills. 106 2023 Blue Cross\u00ae and Blue Shield\u00ae Service Benefit Plan Standard and Basic Option Section 5(f) Standard and Basic Option Quantity allowances - Specific allowances for several medications are based on U.S. FDA-approved recommendations, national scientific and generally accepted standards of medical practice guidelines (such as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Medical Association, etc.), and manufacturer guidelines.

Prior Appr oval As part of our Patient Safety and Quality Monitoring (PSQM) program (see page 106), you must make sur e that your physician obtains prior appr oval for certain pr escription drugs and supplies in order to use your pr escription drug coverage. In providing prior approval, we may limit benefits to quantities prescribed in accordance with generally accepted standards of medical, dental, or psychiatric practice in the United States. Our prior approval process may include step therapy , which requires you to use a generic and/or preferred medication(s) before a non-preferred medication is covered. Prior appr oval must be r enewed periodically . T o obtain a list of these drugs and supplies and to obtain prior approval request forms, call the Retail Pharmacy Program at 800-624-5060, TTY : 71 1. Y ou can also obtain the list and forms through our website at www .fepblue.or g. Please read Section 3 for more information about prior approval. Please note that updates to the list of drugs and supplies requiring prior approval are made periodically during the year . New drugs and supplies may be added to the list and prior approval criteria may change. Changes to the prior approval list or to prior approval criteria are not considered benefit changes. Note: If your prescription requires prior approval and you have not yet obtained prior approval, you must pay the full cost of the drug or supply at the time of purchase and file a claim with the Retail Pharmacy Program to be reimbursed. Please refer to Section 7 for instructions on how to file prescription drug claims. Note: It is your responsibility to know the prior approval authorization expiration date for your medication.

Y ou may appeal directly to the U.S. Of fice of Personnel Management (OPM) if we do not follow required claims processes. For more information or to make an inquiry about situations in which you are entitled to immediately appeal to OPM, including additional requirements not listed in Sections 3, 7, and 8 of this brochure, please call your Plan' s customer service representative at the phone number found on your enrollment card, our brochure, or our website ( www .fepblue.or g).

Our reconsideration will take into account all comments, documents, records, and other information submitted by you relating to the claim, without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination. When our initial decision is based (in whole or in part) on a medical judgment (i.e., medical necessity , experimental/investigational), we will consult with a healthcare professional who has appropriate training and experience in the field of medicine involved in the medical judgment and who was not involved in making the initial decision. Our reconsideration will not take into account the initial decision. The review will not be conducted by the same person, or their subordinate, who made the initial decision. W e will not make our decisions regarding hiring, compensation, termination, promotion, or other similar matters with respect to any individual (such as a claims adjudicator or medical expert) based upon the likelihood that the individual will support the denial of benefits. Step Description Ask us in writing to reconsider our initial decision. Y ou must: a) W rite to us within 6 months from the date of our decision; and b) Send your request to us at the address shown on your explanation of benefits (EOB) form for the Local Plan that processed the claim (or , for Prescription drug benefits, our Retail Pharmacy Program, Mail Service Prescription Drug Program, or the Specialty Drug Pharmacy Program); and c) Include a statement about why you believe our initial decision was wrong, based on specific benefit provisions in this brochure; and d) Include copies of documents that support your claim, such as physicians' letters, operative reports, bills, medical records, and explanation of benefits (EOB) forms.

W e will provide you with this information suf ficiently in advance of the date that we are required to provide you with our reconsideration decision to allow you a reasonable opportunity to respond to us before that date. However , our failure to provide you with new evidence or rationale in suf ficient time to allow you to timely respond shall not invalidate our decision on reconsideration. Y ou may respond to that new evidence or rationale at the OPM review stage described in Step 3. 1 In the case of a post-service claim, we have 30 days from the date we receive your request to: a) Pay the claim or b) W rite to you and maintain our denial or 2 139 2023 Blue Cross\u00ae and Blue Shield\u00ae Service Benefit Plan Section 8 c) Ask you or your provider for more information.

W e will write to you with our decision. If you do not agree with our decision, you may ask OPM to review it. Y ou must write to OPM within: 90 days after the date of our letter upholding our initial decision; or 120 days after you first wrote to us - if we did not answer that request in some way within 30 days; or 120 days after we asked for additional information - if we did not send you a decision within 30 days after we received the additional information.

Please note that by providing your email address, you may receive OPM' s decision more quickly . Note: If you want OPM to review more than one claim, you must clearly identify which documents apply to which claim. Note: Y ou are the only person who has a right to file a disputed claim with OPM. Parties acting as your representative, such as medical providers, must include a copy of your specific written consent with the review request. However , for ur gent care claims, a healthcare professional with knowledge of your medical condition may act as your authorized representative without your express consent. Note: The above deadlines may be extended if you show that you were unable to meet the deadline because of reasons beyond your control. 3 OPM will review your disputed claim request and will use the information it collects from you and us to decide whether our decision is correct. OPM will determine if we correctly applied the terms of our contract when we denied your claim or request for service. OPM will send you a final decision within 60 days. There are no other administrative appeals. If you do not agree with OPM' s decision, your only recourse is to file a lawsuit. If you decide to sue, you must file the suit against OPM in Federal court by December 31 of the third year after the year in which you received the disputed services, drugs, or supplies, or from the year in which you were denied precertification or prior approval. This is the only deadline that may not be extended. OPM may disclose the information it collects during the review process to support their disputed claims decision. This information will become part of the court record. Y ou may not file a lawsuit until you have completed the disputed claims process.

For example, we do not determine whether you or a family member is covered under this Plan. Y ou must raise eligibility issues with your agency personnel/payroll of fice if you are an employee, your retirement system if you are an annuitant, or the Of fice of W orkers' Compensation Programs if you are receiving W orkers' Compensation benefits. 141 2023 Blue Cross\u00ae and Blue Shield\u00ae Service Benefit Plan Section 8 Section 9. Coordinating Benefits W ith Medicar e and Other Coverage Y ou must tell us if you or a cover ed family member has coverage under any other gr oup health plan or has automobile insurance that pays healthcar e expenses without r egard to fault. This is called \"double coverage.\" When you have double coverage, one plan normally pays its benefits in full as the primary payor and the other plan pays a r educed benefit as the secondary payor . W e, like other insur ers, determine which coverage is primary according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' (NAIC) guidelines. For example: If you are covered under our Plan as a dependent, any group health insurance you have from your employer will pay primary and we will pay secondary . If you are an annuitant under our Plan and also are actively employed, any group health insurance you have from your employer will pay primary and we will pay secondary . When you are entitled to the payment of healthcare expenses under automobile insurance, including no-fault insurance and other insurance that pays without regard to fault, your automobile insurance is the primary payor and we are the secondary payor . For more information on NAIC rules regarding the coordinating of benefits, visit our website at www .fepblue.or g/coordinationofbenefits. When we are the primary payor , we will pay the benefits described in this brochure. When we are the secondary payor , we will determine our allowance. After the primary plan processes the benefit, we will pay what is left of our allowance, up to our regular benefit. W e will not pay more than our allowance. For example, we will generally only make up the dif ference between the primary payor ' s benefits payment and 100% of the Plan allowance, subject to our applicable deductible (under Standard Option) and coinsurance or copayment amounts, except when Medicare is the primary payor (see page 150). Thus, it is possible that the combined payments from both plans may not equal the entire amount billed by the provider . Note: When we pay secondary to primary coverage you have from a prepaid plan (HMO), we base our benefits on your out-of-pocket liability under the prepaid plan (generally , the prepaid plan' s copayments), subject to our deductible (under Standard Option) and coinsurance or copayment amounts. In certain circumstances when we are secondary and there is no adverse ef fect on you (that is, you do not pay any more), we may also take advantage of any provider discount arrangements your primary plan may have and only make up the dif ference between the primary plan' s payment and the amount the provider has agreed to accept as payment in full from the primary plan. Note: Any visit limitations that apply to your care under this plan are still in ef fect when we are the secondary payor . Remember: Even if you do not file a claim with your other plan, you must still tell us that you have double coverage, and you must also send us documents about your other coverage if we ask for them. Please see Section 4, Y our Costs for Cover ed Services , for mor e information about how we pay claims. When you have other health coverage TRICARE is the healthcare program for eligible dependents of military persons, and retirees of the military . TRICARE includes the CHAMPUS program. CHAMPV A provides health coverage to disabled V eterans and their eligible dependents. If TRICARE or CHAMPV A and this Plan cover you, we pay first. See your TRICARE or CHAMPV A Health Benefits Advisor if you have questions about these programs. TRICARE and CHAMPV A 142 2023 Blue Cross\u00ae and Blue Shield\u00ae Service Benefit Plan Section 9 Suspended FEHB coverage to enr oll in TRICARE or CHAMPV A: If you are an annuitant or former spouse, you can suspend your FEHB coverage to enroll in one of these programs, eliminating your FEHB premium. (OPM does not contribute to any applicable Plan premiums.) For information on suspending your FEHB enrollment, contact your retirement or employing of fice. If you later want to re-enroll in the FEHB Program, generally you may do so only at the next Open Season unless you involuntarily lose coverage under TRICARE or CHAMPV A. Every job-related injury or illness should be reported as soon as possible to your supervisor . Injury also means any illness or disease that is caused or aggravated by the employment as well as damage to medical braces, artificial limbs and other prosthetic devices. If you are a federal or postal employee, ask your supervisor to authorize medical treatment by use of form CA-16 before you obtain treatment. If your medical treatment is accepted by the Dept. of Labor Of fice of W orkers' Compensation (OWCP), the provider will be compensated by OWCP . If your treatment is determined not job-related, we will process your benefit according to the terms of this plan, including use of in-network providers. T ake form CA-16 and form OWCP-1500/HCF A-1500 to your provider , or send it to your provider as soon as possible after treatment, to avoid complications about whether your treatment is covered by this plan or by OWCP . W e do not cover services that: Y ou (or a covered family member) need because of a workplace-related illness or injury that the Of fice of W orkers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) or a similar federal or state agency determines they must provide; or OWCP or a similar agency pays for through a third-party injury settlement or other similar proceeding that is based on a claim you filed under OWCP or similar laws. Once OWCP or a similar agency pays its maximum benefits for your treatment, we will cover your care. W orkers' Compensation When you have this Plan and Medicaid, we pay first. Suspended FEHB coverage to enr oll in Medicaid or a similar state-sponsor ed pr ogram of medical assistance: If you are an annuitant or former spouse, you can suspend your FEHB coverage to enroll in one of these state programs, eliminating your FEHB premium. For information on suspending your FEHB enrollment, contact your retirement or employing of fice. If you later want to re-enroll in the FEHB Program, generally you may do so only at the next Open Season unless you involuntarily lose coverage under the state program. Medicaid W e do not cover services and supplies when a local, state, or federal government agency directly or indirectly pays for them. When other Government agencies ar e r esponsible for your car e If another person or entity , through an act or omission, causes you to suf fer an injury or illness, and if we paid benefits for that injury or illness, you must agree to the provisions listed below . In addition, if you are injured and no other person or entity is responsible but you receive (or are entitled to) a recovery from another source, and if we paid benefits for that injury , you must agree to the following provisions: All recoveries you or your representatives obtain (whether by lawsuit, settlement, insurance or benefit program claims, or otherwise), no matter how described or designated, must be used to reimburse us in full for benefits we paid. Our share of any recovery extends only to the amount of benefits we have paid or will pay to you, your representatives, and/or healthcare providers on your behalf. For purposes of this provision, \"you\" includes your covered dependents, and \"your representatives\" include, if applicable, your heirs, administrators, legal representatives, parents (if you are a minor), successors, or assignees. This is our right of recovery . When others ar e r esponsible for injuries 143 2023 Blue Cross\u00ae and Blue Shield\u00ae Service Benefit Plan Section 9 W e are entitled under our right of recovery to be reimbursed for our benefit payments even if you are not \"made whole\" for all of your damages in the recoveries that you receive. Our right of recovery is not subject to reduction for attorney' s fees and costs under the \"common fund\" or any other doctrine. W e will not reduce our share of any recovery unless, in the exercise of our discretion, we agree in writing to a reduction (1) because you do not receive the full amount of damages that you claimed or (2) because you had to pay attorneys' fees. Y ou must cooperate in doing what is reasonably necessary to assist us with our right of recovery . Y ou must not take any action that may prejudice our right of recovery . If you do not seek damages for your illness or injury , you must permit us to initiate recovery on your behalf (including the right to bring suit in your name). This is called subrogation. If you do seek damages for your illness or injury , you must tell us promptly that you have made a claim against another party for a condition that we have paid or may pay benefits for , you must seek recovery of our benefit payments and liabilities, and you must tell us about any recoveries you obtain, whether in or out of court. W e may seek a first priority lien on the proceeds of your claim in order to reimburse ourselves to the full amount of benefits we have paid or will pay . W e may request that you sign a reimbursement agreement and/or assign to us (1) your right to bring an action or (2) your right to the proceeds of a claim for your illness or injury . W e may delay processing of your claims until you provide the signed reimbursement agreement and/or assignment, and we may enforce our right of recovery by of fsetting future benefits. Note: W e will pay the costs of any covered services you receive that are in excess of any recoveries made. Our rights of recovery and subrogation as described in this Section may be enforced, at the Carrier ' s option, by the Carrier , by any of the Local Plans that administered the benefits paid in connection with the injury or illness at issue, or by any combination of these entities. Please be aware that more than one Local Plan may have a right of recovery/subrogation for claims arising from a single incident (e.g., a car accident resulting in claims paid by multiple Local Plans) and that the resolution by one Local Plan of its lien will not eliminate another Local Plan' s right of recovery . Among the other situations covered by this provision, the circumstances in which we may subrogate or assert a right of recovery shall also include: When a third party injures you, for example, in an automobile accident or through medical malpractice; When you are injured on premises owned by a third party; or When you are injured and benefits are available to you or your dependent, under any law or under any type of insurance, including, but not limited to: - No-fault insurance and other insurance that pays without regard to fault, including personal injury protection benefits, regardless of any election made by you to treat those benefits as secondary to this Plan - Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage - W orkers' Compensation benefits - Medical reimbursement coverage Contact us if you need more information about subrogation. 144 2023 Blue Cross\u00ae and Blue Shield\u00ae Service Benefit Plan Section 9 Some FEHB plans already cover some dental and vision services. When you are covered by more than one dental/vision plan, coverage provided under your FEHB plan remains as your primary coverage. FEDVIP coverage pays secondary to that coverage. When you enroll in a dental and/or vision plan, you will be asked to provide information on your FEHB plan so that your plans can coordinate benefits. Providing your FEHB information may reduce your out-of-pocket cost. When you have Federal Employees Dental and V ision Insurance Plan (FEDVIP) If you are a participant in an approved clinical trial, this health Plan will provide benefits for covered related care as follows, if it is not provided by the clinical trial: Routine car e costs - costs for medically necessary services such as doctor visits, lab tests, X-rays and scans, and hospitalizations related to treating the patient' s condition, whether the patient is in a clinical trial or is receiving standard therapy . W e provide benefits for these types of costs at the benefit levels described in Section 5 ( Benefits ) when the services are covered under the Plan and we determine that they are medically necessary . Extra car e costs - costs of covered services related to taking part in a clinical trial such as additional tests that a patient may need as part of the trial, but not as part of the patient' s routine care. This Plan covers extra care costs related to taking part in an approved clinical trial for a covered stem cell transplant such as additional tests that a patient may need as part of the clinical trial protocol, but not as part of the patient' s routine care. For more information about approved clinical trials for covered stem cell transplants, see pages 69-76. Extra car e costs r elated to taking part in any other type of clinical trial ar e not cover ed . W e encourage you to contact us at the customer service phone number on the back of your ID card to discuss specific services if you participate in a clinical trial. Resear ch costs - costs related to conducting the clinical trial such as research physician and nurse time, analysis of results, and clinical tests performed only for research purposes. These costs are generally covered by the clinical trials. This Plan does not cover these costs. An approved clinical trial includes a phase I, phase II, phase III, or phase IV clinical trial that is conducted in relation to the prevention, detection, or treatment of cancer or other life-threatening disease or condition, and is either Federally funded; conducted under an investigational new drug application reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA); or is a drug trial that is exempt from the requirement of an investigational new drug application.

When you have Medicar e The Original Medicare Plan (Original Medicare) is available everywhere in the United States. It is the way everyone used to get Medicare benefits and is the way most people get their Medicare Part A and Part B benefits now . Y ou may go to any doctor , specialist, or hospital that accepts Medicare. The Original Medicare Plan pays its share and you pay your share. All physicians and other providers are required by law to file claims directly to Medicare for members with Medicare Part B, when Medicare is primary . This is true whether or not they accept Medicare. When you are enrolled in Original Medicare along with this Plan, you still need to follow the rules in this brochure for us to cover your care. For example, you must continue to obtain prior approval for some prescription drugs and or gan/tissue transplants before we will pay benefits. However , you do not have to precertify inpatient hospital stays when Medicare Part A is primary (see page 21 for exceptions). Claims pr ocess when you have the Original Medicar e Plan - Y ou will probably not need to file a claim form when you have both our Plan and the Original Medicare Plan. The Original Medicar e Plan (Part A or Part B) 145 2023 Blue Cross\u00ae and Blue Shield\u00ae Service Benefit Plan Section 9 When we are the primary payor , we process the claim first. When the Original Medicare Plan is the primary payor , Medicare processes your claim first. In most cases, your claim will be coordinated automatically and we will then provide secondary benefits for the covered char ges. T o find out if you need to do something to file your claims, call us at the customer service phone number on the back of your Service Benefit Plan ID card or visit our website at www .fepblue.or g. W e waive some costs if the Original Medicar e Plan is your primary payor - W e will waive some out-of-pocket costs as follows: When Medicar e Part A is primary - Under Standard Option, we will waive our: - Inpatient hospital per -admission copayments; and - Inpatient Member and Non-member hospital coinsurance. Under Basic Option, we will waive our: - Inpatient hospital per -day copayments. Note: Once you have exhausted your Medicare Part A benefits: Under Standard Option , you must then pay any dif ference between our allowance and the billed amount at Non-member hospitals.

Y ou can find more information about how our Plan coordinates benefits with Medicare in our Medicare and Y ou Guide for Federal Employees available online at www .fepblue.or g. Y ou must tell us if you or a covered family member has Medicare coverage, and let us obtain information about services denied or paid under Medicare if we ask. Y ou must also tell us about other coverage you or your covered family members may have, as this coverage may af fect the primary/secondary status of this Plan and Medicare. T ell us about your Medicar e coverage If you are enrolled in Medicare Part B, a physician may ask you to sign a private contract agreeing that you can be billed directly for services ordinarily covered by Original Medicare. Should you sign an agreement, Medicare will not pay any portion of the char ges, and we will not increase our payment. W e will still limit our payment to the amount we would have paid after Original Medicare' s payment. Y ou may be responsible for paying the dif ference between the billed amount and the amount we paid. Private contract with your physician 146 2023 Blue Cross\u00ae and Blue Shield\u00ae Service Benefit Plan Section 9 If you are eligible for Medicare, you may choose to enroll in and get your Medicare benefits from a Medicare Advantage plan. These are private healthcare choices (like HMOs and regional PPOs) in some areas of the country . T o learn more about Medicare Advantage plans, contact Medicare at 800-MEDICARE (800-633-4227), TTY : 71 1, or at www .medicare.gov . If you enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan, the following options are available to you: This Plan and another plan' s Medicar e Advantage plan: Y ou may enroll in another plan' s Medicare Advantage plan and also remain enrolled in our FEHB Plan. If you enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan, tell us. W e will need to know whether you are in the Original Medicare Plan or in a Medicare Advantage plan so we can correctly coordinate benefits with Medicare. Under Standard Option, we will still provide benefits when your Medicare Advantage plan is primary , even out of the Medicare Advantage plan' s network and/or service area. However , we will not waive any of our copayments, coinsurance, or deductibles, if you receive services from providers who do not participate in the Medicare Advantage plan. Under Basic Option, we provide benefits for care received from Preferred providers when your Medicare Advantage plan is primary , even out of the Medicare Advantage plan' s network and/or service area. However , we will not waive any of our copayments or coinsurance for services you receive from Preferred providers who do not participate in the Medicare Advantage plan. Please remember that you must receive care from Preferred providers in order to receive Basic Option benefits. See page 20 for the exceptions to this requirement. Suspended FEHB coverage to enr oll in a Medicar e Advantage plan: If you are an annuitant or former spouse, you can suspend your FEHB coverage to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan, eliminating your FEHB premium. (OPM does not contribute to your Medicare Advantage plan premium.) For information on suspending your FEHB enrollment, contact your retirement or employing of fice. If you later want to re-enroll in the FEHB Program, generally you may do so only at the next Open Season unless you involuntarily lose coverage or move out of the Medicare Advantage plan' s service area. Medicar e Advantage (Part C) When we are the primary payor , we process the claim first. If you enroll in Medicare Part D and we are the secondary payor , we will review claims for your prescription drug costs that are not covered by Medicare Part D and consider them for payment under the FEHB plan. Medicar e pr escription drug coverage (Part D) This health plan does not coordinate its prescription drug benefits with Medicare Part B. Medicar e pr escription drug coverage (Part B) 147 2023 Blue Cross\u00ae and Blue Shield\u00ae Service Benefit Plan Section 9 Medicare always makes the final determination as to whether they are the primary payor . The following chart illustrates whether Medicare or this Plan should be the primary payor for you according to your employment status and other factors determined by Medicare. It is critical that you tell us if you or a covered family member has Medicare coverage so we can administer these requirements correctly . (Having coverage under mor e than two health plans may change the order of benefits determined on this chart.) Primary Payor Chart A.

Y our physician and hospital must follow Medicare rules and cannot bill you for more than they could bill you if you had Medicare. Y ou and the FEHB benefit from these payment limits. Outpatient hospital care and non-physician-based care are not covered by this law; regular Plan benefits apply . The following chart has more information about the limits. If you: are age 65 or over; and do not have Medicare Part A, Part B, or both; and have this Plan as an annuitant or as a former spouse, or as a family member of an annuitant or former spouse; and are not employed in a position that gives FEHB coverage. (Y our employing of fice can tell you if this applies.) Then, for your inpatient hospital car e: The law requires us to base our payment on an amount - the \"equivalent Medicare amount\" - set by Medicare' s rules for what Medicare would pay , not on the actual char ge. Y ou are responsible for your deductible (Standard Option only), coinsurance, or copayments under this Plan. Y ou are not responsible for any char ges greater than the equivalent Medicare amount; we will show that amount on the explanation of benefits (EOB) form that we send you. The law prohibits a hospital from collecting more than the equivalent Medicare amount. And, for your physician car e, the law requires us to base our payment and your applicable coinsurance or copayment on: an amount set by Medicare and called the \"Medicare-approved amount,\" or the actual char ge if it is lower than the Medicare-approved amount. If your physician: Participates with Medicare or accepts Medicare assignment for the claim and is in our Preferred network Then you ar e r esponsible for: Standard Option - your deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments. Basic Option - your copayments and coinsurance. If your physician: Participates with Medicare or accepts Medicare assignment and is not in our Preferred network Then you ar e r esponsible for: Standard Option - your deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments, and any balance up to the Medicare-approved amount. Basic Option - all char ges. If your physician: Does not participate with Medicare and is in our Preferred network Note: In many cases, your payment will be less because of our Preferred agreements. Contact your Local Plan for information about what your specific Preferred provider can collect from you. Then you ar e r esponsible for: Standard Option - your deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments, and any balance up to 1 15% of the Medicare-approved amount. Basic Option - your copayments and coinsurance, and any balance up to 1 15% of the Medicare-approved amount. If your physician: Does not participate with Medicare and is not in our Preferred network Then you ar e r esponsible for: Standard Option - your deductibles, coinsurance, copayments, and any balance up to 1 15% of the Medicare-approved amount. Basic Option - all char ges. 149 2023 Blue Cross\u00ae and Blue Shield\u00ae Service Benefit Plan Section 9 If your physician: Opts-out of Medicare via private contract Then you ar e r esponsible for: Standard Option - your deductibles, coinsurance, copayments, and any balance your physician char ges. Basic Option - your deductibles, coinsurance, copayments, and any balance your physician char ges. It is generally to your financial advantage to use a physician who participates with Medicare. Such physicians are permitted to collect only up to the Medicare-approved amount. Our explanation of benefits (EOB) form will tell you how much the physician or hospital can collect from you. If your physician or hospital tries to collect more than allowed by law , ask the physician or hospital to reduce the char ges. If you have paid more than allowed, ask for a refund. If you need further assistance, call us. A physician may have opted-out of Medicare and may or may not ask you to sign a private contract agreeing that you can be billed directly for services ordinarily covered by Original Medicare. This is dif ferent than a Non-participating doctor , and we recommend you ask your physician if they have opted-out of Medicare. Should you visit an opt-out physician, the physician will not be limited to 1 15% of the Medicare-approved amount. Y ou may be responsible for paying the dif ference between the billed amount and our regular in-network/out-of-network benefits. Physicians Who Opt-Out of Medicar e W e limit our payment to an amount that supplements the benefits that Medicare would pay under Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) and Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance), regardless of whether Medicare pays. Note: W e pay our regular benefits for emer gency services to a facility provider , such as a hospital, that does not participate with Medicare and is not reimbursed by Medicare. W e use the Department of V eterans Af fairs (V A) Medicare-equivalent Remittance Advice (MRA) when the MRA statement is submitted to determine our payment for covered services provided to you if Medicare is primary , when Medicare does not pay the V A facility . If you are covered by Medicare Part B and it is primary , your out-of-pocket costs for services that both Medicare Part B and we cover depend on whether your physician accepts Medicare assignment for the claim. If your physician accepts Medicare assignment, you pay nothing for covered char ges (see note below for Basic Option). If your physician does not accept Medicare assignment, you pay the dif ference between the \"limiting char ge\" or the physician' s char ge (whichever is less) and our payment combined with Medicare' s payment (see note below for Basic Option). Note: Under Basic Option, you must see Pr eferr ed providers in order to receive benefits. See page 20 for the exceptions to this requirement. It is important to know that a physician who does not accept Medicare assignment may not bill you for more than 1 15% of the amount Medicare bases its payment on, called the \"limiting char ge.\" The Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) form that you receive from Medicare will have more information about the limiting char ge. If your physician tries to collect more than allowed by law , ask the physician to reduce the char ges. If the physician does not, report the physician to the Medicare carrier that sent you the MSN form. Call us if you need further assistance.

Intensive outpatient car e A Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan that serves a specific geographic area. Local Plan 154 2023 Blue Cross\u00ae and Blue Shield\u00ae Service Benefit Plan Section 10 The term medical food, as defined in Section 5(b) of the Orphan Drug Act (21 U.S.C. 360ee (b) (3)) is \"a food which is formulated to be consumed or administered enterally under the supervision of a physician and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation.\" In general, to be considered a medical food, a product must, at a minimum, meet the following criteria: the product must be a food for oral or tube feeding; the product must be labeled for the dietary management of a specific medical disorder , disease, or condition for which there are distinctive nutritional requirements; and the product must be intended to be used under medical supervision. Medical foods All benefits are subject to the definitions, limitations, and exclusions in this brochure and are payable only when we determine that the criteria for medical necessity are met. Medical necessity shall mean healthcare services that a physician, hospital, or other covered professional or facility provider , exercising prudent clinical judgment, would provide to a patient for the purpose of preventing, evaluating, diagnosing, or treating an illness, injury , disease, or its symptoms, and that are: 1. In accordance with generally accepted standards of medical practice in the United States; and 2. Clinically appropriate, in terms of type, frequency , extent, site, and duration; and considered ef fective for the patient' s illness, injury , disease, or its symptoms; and 3. Not primarily for the convenience of the patient, physician, or other healthcare provider , and not more costly than an alternative service or sequence of services at least as likely to produce equivalent therapeutic or diagnostic results for the diagnosis or treatment of that patient' s illness, injury , or disease, or its symptoms; and 4. Not part of or associated with scholastic education or vocational training of the patient; and 5. In the case of inpatient care, able to be provided safely only in the inpatient setting. For these purposes, \"generally accepted standards of medical practice\" means standards that are based on credible scientific evidence published in peer -reviewed medical literature generally recognized by the relevant medical community and physician specialty society recommendations. The fact that one of our cover ed physicians, hospitals, or other pr ofessional or facility pr oviders has pr escribed, r ecommended, or appr oved a service or supply does not, in itself, make it medically necessary or cover ed under this Plan. Medical necessity Under the telehealth benefit you have on-demand access to care for common, non-emer gent conditions. Examples of common conditions include sinus problems, rashes, aller gies, cold and flu symptoms, etc. Minor acute conditions Errors in medical care that are clearly identifiable, preventable, and serious in their consequences, such as sur gery performed on a wrong body part, and specific conditions that are acquired during your hospital stay , such as severe bed sores. For more information, see pages 7-8. Never Events Although you may stay overnight in a hospital room and receive meals and other hospital services, some services and overnight stays - including \"observation services\" - are actually outpatient care. Observation care includes care provided to members who require significant treatment or monitoring before a physician can decide whether to admit them on an inpatient basis, or dischar ge them to home. The provider may need 6 to 24 hours or more to make that decision. If you are in the hospital more than a few hours, always ask your physician or the hospital staf f if your stay is considered inpatient or outpatient. Observation services Y ou are an outpatient if you are getting emer gency department services, observation services, outpatient sur gery , lab tests, X-rays, or any other hospital services, and the doctor has not written an order to admit you to a hospital as an inpatient. In these cases, you are an outpatient even if you are admitted to a room in the hospital for observation and spend the night at the hospital. Outpatient Our Plan allowance is the amount we use to determine our payment and your cost-share for covered services. Fee-for -service plans determine their allowances in dif ferent ways. If the amount your provider bills for covered services is less than our allowance, we base your share (coinsurance, deductible, and/or copayments), on the billed amount. W e determine our allowance as follows: Plan allowance 155 2023 Blue Cross\u00ae and Blue Shield\u00ae Service Benefit Plan Section 10 PPO pr oviders - Our allowance (which we may refer to as the \"PP A\" for \"Preferred Provider Allowance\") is the negotiated amount that Preferred providers (hospitals and other facilities, physicians, and other covered healthcare professionals that contract with each local Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plan, and retail pharmacies that contract with CVS Caremark) have agreed to accept as payment in full, when we pay primary benefits. Our PPO allowance includes any known discounts that can be accurately calculated at the time your claim is processed. For PPO facilities, we sometimes refer to our allowance as the \"Preferred rate.\" The Preferred rate may be subject to a periodic adjustment after your claim is processed that may decrease or increase the amount of our payment that is due to the facility . However , your cost-sharing (if any) does not change. If our payment amount is decreased, we credit the amount of the decrease to the reserves of this Plan. If our payment amount is increased, we pay that cost on your behalf. (See page 123 for special information about limits on the amounts Preferred dentists can char ge you under Standard Option.) Participating pr oviders - Our allowance (which we may refer to as the \"P AR\" for \"Participating Provider Allowance\") is the negotiated amount that these providers (hospitals and other facilities, physicians, and other covered healthcare professionals that contract with some local Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans) have agreed to accept as payment in full, when we pay primary benefits. For facilities, we sometimes refer to our allowance as the \"Member rate.\" The Member rate includes any known discounts that can be accurately calculated at the time your claim is processed, and may be subject to a periodic adjustment after your claim is processed that may decrease or increase the amount of our payment that is due to the facility . However , your cost-sharing (if any) does not change. If our payment amount is decreased, we credit the amount of the decrease to the reserves of this Plan. If our payment amount is increased, we pay that cost on your behalf. Non-participating pr oviders - W e have no agreements with these providers to limit what they can bill you for their services. This means that using Non-participating providers could result in your having to pay significantly greater amounts for the services you receive. W e determine our allowance as follows: - For inpatient services at hospitals, and other facilities that do not contract with your local Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plan (\"Non-member facilities\"), our allowance is based on the Local Plan Allowance. The Local Plan Allowance varies by region and is determined by each Plan. If you would like additional information, or to obtain the current allowed amount, please call the customer service phone number on the back of your ID card. For inpatient stays resulting from medical emer gencies or accidental injuries, or for emer gency deliveries, our allowance is the lesser of the billed amount or the qualifying payment amount (QP A) determined in accordance with federal laws and regulations; - For outpatient, non-emer gency services at hospitals and other facilities that do not contract with your local Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plan (\"Non-member facilities\"), our allowance is the Local Plan Allowance. This allowance applies to all of the covered services billed by the hospital. If you plan on using a Non-member hospital, or other Non-member facility , for your outpatient procedure, please call us before you receive services at the customer service phone number on the back of your ID card to obtain the current allowed amount and assistance in estimating your total out-of-pocket expenses; - For outpatient dialysis services performed or billed by hospitals and other facilities that do not contract with the local Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plan (\"Non-member facilities\"), our allowance is the Local Plan allowance in the geographic area in which the care was performed or obtained. This allowance applies to the covered dialysis services billed by the hospital or facility . Contact your Local Plan if you need more information. Please keep in mind that Non-member facilities may bill you for any dif ference between the allowance and the billed amount. Y ou may be able to reduce your out-of-pocket expenses by using a Preferred hospital for your outpatient sur gical procedure or dialysis.

In the absence of a Medicare participating fee schedule amount or ASP for any service, drug, or supply , our allowance is the Local Plan Allowance. Contact your Local Plan if you need more information. W e may refer to our allowance for Non-participating providers as the \"NP A\" (for \"Non-participating Provider Allowance\"); - For emer gency medical services performed in the emer gency department of a hospital provided by physicians and other covered healthcare professionals, and air ambulance providers that do not contract with your local Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plan, our allowance is the lesser of the billed amount or the qualifying payment amount (QP A) determined in accordance with federal laws and regulations; - For prescription drugs furnished by retail pharmacies that do not contract with CVS Caremark, our allowance is the average wholesale price (A WP) of a drug on the date it is dispensed, as set forth by Medi-Span in its national drug data file; and - For services you receive outside of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. V ir gin Islands from providers that do not contract with us or with the Overseas Assistance Center (provided by GMMI), we use our Overseas Fee Schedule to determine our allowance. Our fee schedule is based on a percentage of the amounts we allow for Non-participating providers in the W ashington, D.C., area, or a customary percent of billed char ge, whichever is higher . Note: Using Non-participating or Non-member pr oviders could r esult in your having to pay significantly gr eater amounts for the services you r eceive. Non-participating and Non-member providers are under no obligation to accept our allowance as payment in full. If you use Non- participating and/or Non-member providers, you will be responsible for any dif ference between our payment and the billed amount (except in certain circumstances involving covered Non-participating professional care - see below). In addition, you will be responsible for any applicable deductible, coinsurance, or copayment. Y ou can reduce your out-of-pocket expenses by using Preferred providers whenever possible. T o locate a Preferred provider , visit www .fepblue.or g/provider to use our National Doctor & Hospital Finder , or call us at the customer service phone number on the back of your ID card. W e encourage you to always use Preferred providers for your care. Note: For certain covered services from Non-participating professional providers, your responsibility for the dif ference between the Non-participating Provider Allowance (NP A) and the billed amount may be limited. See page 32. For more information, see Dif ferences between our allowance and the bill in Section 4. For more information about how we pay providers overseas, see pages 32 and 130.
