While combination antiretroviral therapies have significantly reduced HIV related morbidity and mortality, and also reduce transmission risk, ending the pandemic will require an effective vaccine to prevent new infections, and a strategy to cure HIV for those already living with t he virus. These dual g oals however are still a long way off. One of the biggest cha llenges facing both HIV vaccine and cure development is HIV's extensive genetic diversity. At the same time however, the detailed study of both individual- and population-level HIV diversity can yield key biological insights that can help inform HIV vaccine and curative approaches. This thesis encompasses three original research chapters united under this theme. The first original research chapter of this thesis identifies mutational immune escape pathways in HIV subtypes A1 and D, two understudied subtypes that co-circulate in Uganda. It then goes on to formally compare escape pathways between HIV subtypes and characterize the mechanisms whereby they arise. This research was among the first to systematically explore the influence of viral genetic context on HIV diversity and identify constrained viral sites that may r epresent useful vaccine targets for these subtypes. The second original research chapt er transitions to HIV cure research by highlighting the challenges imposed by intra- and inter-individual HIV diversity to the application of a novel molecular assay for HIV reservoir quantification. The third and final original research chapter describes the genetic composition of HIV sequences that persist in the body despite long-term antiretroviral therapy. Specifically, this study leverages information from HIV's within-hos t evolutionary history prior to therapy to estimate how long a given HIV sequence has been persisting in the body, revealing that the longest-lived HIV sequences are ones that harbour major genomic defects. While HIV diversity poses an enormous challenge to vaccine and cure development, results illuminate how it can also be harnessed to gain novel insights into HIV biology towards achieving these goals Keywords : HIV; genetic diversity; evolution; phylogenetics; vaccine; reservoir v Dedication To every person whose life has been impacted by HIV, may this work contribute in some small way to the end of this pandemic. vi Acknowledgements Science is truly a team effort and likewise completion of a PhD takes a great deal of support from many people, something I have been fortunate to receive throughout my scientific and graduate career.

Introduction 1.1. The HIV Pandemic: despite the major success of cART, HIV genetic diversity remains a major challenge to vaccine and curative strategies The first cases of what came to be known as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) were reported in the United States in 19811, 2. To date, an estimated 84.2 million people have been infected with Hu man Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), the causative agent of AIDS3, 4, and 40.1 million people have died of AIDS -related causes5. If left untreated, HIV infection is characterized by a progressive loss of CD4+ T-lymphocytes (CD4+ T-cells) that, over time, leads to immune dysfunction, opportunistic infection, AIDS and eventually death 6. The advent of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in 1996 however transformed HIV into a chronic and manageable condition, dramatically reducing HIV-related morbidity and mortality7-11 and also blocking HIV transmission12, 13. Despite this, disparities in access to antiretroviral treatment14-17 and drug resistance18, 19 remain ongoing challenges to pandemic control, where most of the most heavily affected global regions failed to reach the UNAIDS \"9 0-90-90\" targets of having 90% of people living with HIV (PLWH) be aware of their diagnosis, 90% of all people with diagnosed HIV infection receiving cART, and 90% of individuals receiving cART achieving viral suppression by 2020 20. Indeed, 1.5 million new HIV infections and 650,000 HIV-related deaths occurred in 2021, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa5. Moreover, even though cART potently reduces viremia to undetectable levels, viral recrudescence rapidly occurs if cART is stopped 21, 22. This rebound is the result of a persistent viral reservoir in PLWH, where a stably integrated HIV genome, termed a provirus, exists in a semi-quiescent state and can reactivate in the absence of cART to re-establish viral replication 23-26. cART must therefore be maintained for life, adding a further major challenge to ending the HIV pandemic. The development of a safe and effective vaccine to prevent HIV infection therefore remains critical. Despite substantial efforts over the past 40 years however 27, an HIV vaccine remains elusive and development faces significant challenges. One such challenge is the enormous global genetic diversity of HIV 27, both between and within hosts, that results from HIV's high mutational capacity28. The past decade has also seen a dramatic increase in the pursuit of approaches to permanently silence or eradicate the persistent reservoir, towards the 2 ultimate goal of developing strategies to achieve cART-free HIV remission or cure29. Although an HIV cure has now been achieved in a handful of individuals using high risk, experimental procedures involving stem cell transplantation 30, 31, a safe and scalable curative approach remains a distant goal, and is similarly hampered by both inter- and intra-host HIV diversity. In short, understanding HIV diversity is critical to the advancement of both vaccine and curative approaches, which are in turn critical to ending the pandemic. 1.2. Structure of the HIV-1 Genome While Human Immunodeficiency Virus types 1 and 2 both cause AIDS3, 4, 32, only a limited number of HIV-2 infections occur annually, largely in West Africa32. Rather, it is HIV-1 (specifically HIV-1 group M; see section 1.4) that is responsible for the HIV pandemic 33. HIV hereafter refers to HIV-1 group M strains. HIV-1 is an enveloped retrovirus. Virions are approximately 120nm in size, and contain two copies of HIV's singl e-stranded positive-sense RNA genome34. The HIV-1 genome the typical retroviral fashion of 5'-LTR- gag-pol-env- LTR-3', and in total encodes nine genes that translate into 15 proteins35(Figure 1-1) . This includes the structural gene gag (group-specific antigen), which is transcribed into a single precursor polyprotein pr55gag and subsequently cleaved by HIV-1 protease into several proteins including matrix (p17), which lines the inner membrane of the mature virion providing it structure and shape, capsid (p24), which forms the core of the viral particle, nucleocapsid (p7), which coats the genomic RNA within the virion and binds the packaging signal ( ) of the genome to recruit full-length viral RNA to the assembling virion, and p6, which mediates efficient viral particle release 36. Gag also encodes two spacer peptides (p1 and p2) of no known function36. The HIV-1 genome also encodes the enzymatic polymerase , or pol, gene, which is expressed as a Gag-Pol precursor polyprotein (pr160gag-pol) that is generated by a ribosomal frameshift during translation37. The Pol region of the Gag-Pol polyprotein is subsequently cleaved by the viral protease 38 into four proteins with unique enz ymatic function: Protease (p6), which performs proteolytic well Transcriptase stranded DNA, RNaseH (p15), which degrades the RNA from the RNA:DNA hybrid following reverse transcription, and Integras e (p31), which incorporates the double- 3 stranded DNA HIV-1 genome into that of the host cell39. The HIV-1 genome also contains the env gene, which encodes the glycoprotein precursor gp16040. Gp160 is cleaved into two proteins by a host cellular protease40: the cell surface protein gp120, which binds to the host cell surface receptor CD4 and co-receptors CCR5 and/or CXCR4 to initiate viral entry into the host cell 39, and the transmembrane glycoprotein gp41, which facilitates fusion of the viral envelope with the pl asma membrane of the host cell39. The HIV-1 genome also encodes the regulatory genes tat and rev, which promote viral RNA transcription and fac ilitate the export of unspliced and partially spliced viral RNA transcripts out of the nucleus, respectively39, 41-44. Finally, the HIV-1 genome encodes four accessory proteins that play important roles in HIV-1 infectivity and pathogenesis39. Vif (viral infectivity factor) antagonize s the APOBEC3 family of antiviral host cell proteins that would otherwise induce hypermutation in the viral genome45-47. Vpr (viral protein R) is involved in the transpor t of the pre-integration complex into the nucleus for integration of the vira l genome into that of the host cell48. Vpu (viral protein U) enhances virion release through down-regulat ion of the cell surface receptors CD4 and tetherin49-54. Nef (negative factor) is a highly pleiot ropic protein critical for viral pathogenesis whose functions include enhancement of virion release through down-regulation of CD4 55, host immune evasion through down-regulation of host Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) Class I A and B56-58, enhancement of virion infectivity through down-regulation of the host cell transme mbrane proteins SER INC3 and SERINC559, 60, and promotion of viral replication through enhancement of T-lymphocyte activation61-63. Figure 1-1 Organization of the HIV-1 genome All genes, including structural gag, enzymatic poly merase (pol) and envelope, regulatory tat and rev, and accessory vif, vpr, vpu and nef, and thei r corresponding proteins are indicated. Numbering corresponds to reference strain H XB2 predominantly CD4+ T-lymphocytes (CD4+ T-cells)64, 65(Figure 1- 2). Infection begins when the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120, which exists as a heterodimeric trimer along with the transmembrane gp4166, interacts with the host cell surface receptor CD464, 65. This interaction induces a conformational change in gp120, allowing it to bind to the chemokine co-receptor CCR5 and/or CXCR444, 67. Binding to the co-receptor triggers further conformational changes in gp120 that expose the fusion peptide of gp4168. This fusion peptide is then inserted into the host cell plasma membrane, triggering its fusion with the viral envelope membrane68-70. Following membrane fusion, the virion contents are emptied into the host cell cytoplasm and uncoating of the viral capsid begins, releasing the viral genomic material, nucleocapsid proteins, viral enzymes and other proteins 71. Following uncoating, reverse transcription then occurs where the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme converts the singl e-stranded RNA genome into double-stranded DNA with the assistance of viral RNase H72. HIV-1 Reverse Transcriptase lacks proofreading ability and as such has poor fidelity, introduci ng mutations in the viral genome at a rate of approximately one error per replication cycle28. The error prone nature of this enzyme contributes to the high level of genetic diversity of HIV by producing a large pool of within-host viral variants on which selective pressures, including host immune responses, act to shape within-host HIV evolution throughout the course of untreated infection 73-75. Following reverse transcription, the pre- integration complex (PIC) is formed, comprised of the double-stranded DNA viral g enome, Reverse Transcriptase, Integrase, Vpr, Matrix and Nucleocapsid proteins, as well as host proteins76. The PIC is transported into the nucleus where Integrase catalyzes the insertion of the double-stranded DNA HIV-1 genome into that of the host cell, creating a stably integrated version of the viral genome referred to as a provirus 48, 77-79. The integrated provirus serves as a template for transcription of viral mRNAs, where the earliest transcripts are multiply spliced80, 81. These mRNAs are readily transported into the cytoplasm and translated by the host cellular machinery into the regulatory protei ns Tat and Rev, as well as the accessory protein Nef80, 81. In a positive feedback manner, increasing levels of Tat further enhance the stable transcription of fu ll-length HIV mRNAs, some of which are subsequently singly 5 spliced before nuclear export, that encode other viral proteins or are packaged into new virions as genomic RNA41, 42. Rev enhances the nuclear export of these full-length and singly spliced mRNAs43, 82. Viral proteins and genomic RNAs are recruited to the cell surface for new virion assembly83, 84. Matrix proteins recruit the Gag and Gag-Pol precursor polyproteins to the cell membrane83 and gp160 is cleaved into gp120 and gp41 by a host cell protease while transiting to the cell membrane84. Gag p6 initiates the egress of these immature virions72, 85. Following budding, virions undergo a maturation step in which the Gag and Gag-Pol precursors are cleaved into their respective proteins, and Matrix and Capsid proteins assemble to form mature virions, which can then go on to infect new cells72, 85.

HIV-1 Origins and Global Genetic Diversity HIV-1 is comprised of four groups: M, 'main' ( i.e. the pandemic strain), O 'outlier', N 'non-M, non-O' and P 'putative' 87, 88. Each of these groups originate from independent 6 zoonotic transmission of specific Simian Immunod eficiency Virus (SIV) strains from great apes in West-Equatorial Africa in the early 19th century33, 89, 90. Groups M and N are most closely related to SIVcpz from chimpanzees ( Pan troglodytes troglodytes )91, while groups O and P most likely originated from independent cross-species transfer events of SIVgor from gorillas ( gorilla gorilla gorilla )88, 92. HIV-1 reached low-level prevalence in the Congo Basin during colonial rule, and subsequent socio-behavioural and demographic shifts following independence of countries in this region in the mid-20 th century drove significant increases in HIV transmission33, 90. HIV-1 subsequently disseminated to other regions in Africa along rail and water transportation routes33. Following zoonotic transfer, HIV-1 group M diversified rapidly90, and today consists of 9 subtypes- A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, and K- and over 120 distinct circulating recombinant forms (CRFs)93. The geographic distribution of these subtypes however is not uniform due to independent seeding of the epidemics in diffe rent parts of the world ( i.e. founder effects) 93 (Figure 1- 3). Globally, subtype C is the most prevalent, accounting for approximately 47% of all infections and dominating in Southern Af rica and India, and making significant contributions to epidemics in East Africa93. Subtype B, the most extensively studied subtype, accounts for approximately 12% of infections and dominates in North and South America, the Ca ribbean and Western Europe93. Subtype A accounts for roughly 10% of HIV-1 infections globally and makes a significant contribution to the epidemics of East Africa, where subtype D is also co mmon, as well as the Eastern European and Central Asian HIV-1 epidemics 93. HIV-1 infections in West Africa are most commonly subtype G and CRF02_AG, while CRF01_AE is the dominant form of HIV-1 in South East Asia 93. Globally, the highest level of subtype diversity is observed in West-Central Africa, consistent with zoonotic transmi ssion and subsequent diversification in this area93. HIV's enormous global diversity poses a significant challenge to the design of both HIV vaccine and curative strategies, and efforts to understand this diversity, and the forces that shape it, are critical to achieving these goals. 7 Figure 1-3.

Heterosexually-acquired HIV infections are typically initiated by a single transmitted-founder virus95-97, which then rapidly diversifies into a pool of closely related within-host variants73-75, owing to the error-prone nature of reverse transcriptase73, 74. During acute HIV-1 infection, during which time many individual s experience an influenza-lik e sero-conversion illness98, HIV RNA copies can reach a peak of up to roughly 106 copies/mL blood plasma three to six weeks following infection99(Figure 1-4 ). HIV RNA levels subsequently decline to a much lower viral set point99, as the host CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response arises100-102, and potently eliminates infected cells (set points vary greatly between individuals, averaging approximately 104-105 copies/mL103-106, but ranging from undetectable viral loads in rare HIV elite controllers, and > 105 copies/mL in rapid progressors107, 108). Early on, various lines of evidence already pointed to a critical role for CTLs in HIV control: CTLs inhibit HIV replication ex vivo109, depletion of CD8+ 8 lymphocytes in non-human primate models led to an inability to co ntrol SIV infection110, 111, and a strong temporal relationship existed between the initial CTL response and the establishment of the viral set point101, 112. Later studies also confirmed highly significant association between carriage of specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I alleles, which restrict CTL responses, and HIV viremia control (see sections 1.7 -1.9 below) 113- 119. Despite clear evidence that CTL initially potently control HIV replication in vivo , these cells are incapable of eliminat ing HIV-1, due in large par t to the virus' ability to mutationally escape these responses (detailed in sections 1.7- 1.9 below). If left untreated, HIV replication would continue at set point levels, with concomitant progressive loss of CD4+ T-cells, though individuals may not experience any clinical symptoms for an average of 5-10 years 120, 121. Eventually however, if cART is not initiated, immunodeficiency due to progressive CD4+ T-cell depletion will lead to the emergence of opportunistic infections, AIDS and eventually death6.

The Host CTL Response Against HIV-1 Host CTLs recognize and kill HIV-infected CD4+ T-cells100-102. This recognition is achieved when the T-cell receptor (TCR) on the surface of the CTL interacts with a viral 9 antigenic peptide complexed to a Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) Class I molecule on the surface of the infected CD4+ T-cell122. Because TCR recognition of viral peptide antigen is facilitated by HLA, t he CTL response is HLA-restricted122. Nevertheless, each component of this interaction - the HLA Class I molecule, the viral peptide antigen, and the TCR - plays a critical role in the ability of CTL to targeted HIV-infected cells. 1.6.1. HLA Class I Structure and Diversity The HLA Class I system, the human equiva lent of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I system, is located on the short arm of chromosome 6 (6p21.3) and contains the most polymorphic set of genes in the human genome 123, 124. HLA Class I molecules are encoded by the HLA-A, -B and -C loci 124, where more than 24,000 unique HLA-A, -B and -C alleles have been described to date (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/about/statistics/). Each individual expresses six HLA class I alleles (two from each of the HLA-A, -B, and -C loci) 125. This extensive within- and between-host HLA class I diversity ensures that a broad range of epitopes - viral proteins that have been degraded into shorter antigenic peptides within the infected cell - can be presented by individuals and populations 126. Each HLA Class I molecule consists of two polypeptide chains: the HLA-encoded chain, which determines peptide specificity127-129, and the non-HLA encoded invariant 2-microglobulin chain, which contributes to the structural stability of the molecule123, 128, 129. The 1 and 2 domains of the chain form the peptide-binding groove of the HLA molecule, which has 6 binding pockets, A-F, while 3 is an immunoglobulin-like domain123. HLA Class I molecules typically bind epitopes 8-10 amino acids in length123, 130-132, though some can bind slightly longer peptides133, 134. In general, the amino acid side chains of the second and carboxyl-terminal peptide residues of the epitope bind the B and F pockets of the peptide-binding groove of the HLA molecule respectively, and are thus termed HLA \"anchor residues\"130, though other residues throughout the peptide can also affect the HLA-peptide in teraction and are referred to as \"secondary\" or \"auxiliary anchor\" residues135. These epitope anchor residues strongly determine HLA-peptide specificity130, 136, and ensure that each HLA Class I molecule can bind a large and diverse array of viral epitopes with specific motifs. 10 1.6.2. HIV-1 Epitope Processing and Antigen Presentation In order to be presented on the surface of an HIV-infected cell in complex with Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) Class I, viral proteins that are being expressed within the infected cell must first be degraded into shorter antigenic peptides, or epitopes, in the cell cytoplasm 137. This degradation is performed by the host cell proteasome, a large multicatalytic protease complex138-143. Peptides are then transported into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the host cell protein transporters associated with antigen processing 1 and 2 (TAP-1 and TAP-2) 144-147. Concomitantly, the incomplete and unstable HLA Class I chains, present in the ER membrane, bind the chaperone calnexin, holding the HLA molecule in a partially folded state148. 2-microglobulin then binds to the HLA molecule and calnexin disassociates149. After this, the HLA molecule binds the peptide-loading complex, which is an assembly of proteins including the chaperone calreticulin 150, tapasin, which serves as an intermediary between the HLA and TAP-1 and TAP-2151, 152, and ERp57, an enzyme involved in loading the epitope onto the HLA148. Once an epitope of appropriate specificity binds, the HLA molecule is stable and the peptide-loading complex is released153. The peptide-HLA complex can then leave the ER and be transported to the cell surface for recognition153. 1.6.3. TCR-mediated Recognition of the Peptide-HLA Complex The TCR on the surface of the CTL consists of an -heterodimer that is expressed as a complex with CD3154-156. The and chains each contain a variable and a constant region154-156. The variable chain contains three complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), where the CDR3 region primarily determines antigen recognition and specificity 154-157. Recognition of the peptide-HLA complex on the surface of the infected cell by the TCR triggers a signalling cascade within the CTL that, when paired with additional co-stimulatory158, 159 and cytokine signals160, ultimately leads to a cytolytic response against the infected cell161-164. In this response, granzyme is delivered to the infected cell through perforin-derived pores and subsequently induces cell death through the cleavage and activation of intracellular caspases165, 166. 11 1.7. CTL Response Drives HIV Evolution that is Reproducible Based on Host HLA The host CTL response reduces initial peak viremia to a set point level by eliminating infected cells that display peptide epitopes encoded by the pool of HIV variants replicating within the individual 100-102, 122. Some of these variants however will already encode, or will soon develop, muta tions that abrogate ep itope processing, HLA presentation and/or TCR recognition, allowing cells harbouring such variants to escape CTL recognition. This phenomenon of viral escape from the host CTL response was first observed in vivo as an accumulation of mutations in viral antigens targeted by the host T-cell response, where in some cases the appearance of particular mutations coincided with a shift in the CTL epitopes targeted 167. This represented the earliest evidence that CTL represent a major selective force that continually acts on the within-host pool of variants, thereby driving ongoing HIV evolution and diversification over time 73-75. This same report also correctly inferred that, si nce the CTL response is HLA-restricted, immune escape from CTL responses would be highly HLA allele-dependent167. Indeed, HIV evolution in response to HLA-associated CTL pressures is highly reproducible in nature168. For example, 75% of individuals expressing HLA-B*57 who acquire HIV-1 subtype B will select for the Gag T242N immune escape mutation169, 170, which is located at position three of the Gag TW10 epitope, likely within weeks of infection. Subsequently, 50% of these i ndividuals will select for G248A in the same epitope, thereby conferring complete escape from the host CTL response to this particular epitope 170-172. Owing to the reproducible nature of selection of CTL escape mutations based on HLA class I alleles expressed by the host, these mutations are also referred to as HLA-associated escape mutations. 1.8. Mechanisms of CTL escape CTL escape mutations can be classified into three broad categories based on their mechanism of action ( Figure 1-5) . The first category, antigen processing mutations, affect the degradation of viral proteins into the epitope required for binding and presentation by the host HLA Class I allele 173. The B*57-associated Gag A146P mutation, which is located immediately upstream of the Gag IW9 epitope (Gag codons 147-155) provides an example 168, 174. This substitution prevents N-terminal 12 aminopeptidase trimming of the epitope and therefore its loading on to HLA*57174. Antigen processing mutations can also occur within or distant (either upstream or downstream) from the epitope 175. The second category, HLA-binding mutations, typically occur at epitope anchor positions, thereby reducing the affinity of the peptide-HLA interaction 171. Gag R264K, for example, is located at position two of the B*27-restricted Gag KK10 epitope to HLA- B*27176. The third category of mutations, termed TCR escape mutations, reduce or eliminate recognition of the peptide-HLA complex by the CTL's TCR168. These mutations typically occur at residues in the central region of the epitope that commonly interact with the TCR168. The B*27-associated Gag L268M mutation for example, selected at position six of the Gag KK10 epitope, provides an example167. Epitopes harbouring but many clonotypes cannot recognize the altered peptide-HLA complex177. Figure 1-5 HIV-1 antigen presentation to CTL and mechanisms of HLA-mediated immune escape.

Fitness Costs of CTL Escape Mutations: Selection, Reversion and Compensation CTL escape mutations are selected as they confer an overall fitness advantage to the virus in the presence of that specific host immune response168. Many of these mutations however incur a replicative cost to the virus, such that the original (\"wild-type\") variant actually has the fitness advantage in the absence of the specific selecting immune response 168. The negative replicative effects of certain escape mutations have been clearly demonstrated in vitro by engineering them into HIV reference strains178, and are further supported by the observation that certain CTL escape mutations typically revert back to the subtype consensus when transmitted to an individual who lacks the restricting HLA 169, 170, 179-182. In many cases however, the fitness cost of these escape mutations are negligible, or can be rescued, in full or in part, by compensatory mutations168. For example, the B*27-associated R264K mutation, located at position two of the Gag KK10 epitope, reduces replication capacity so severely that is never occurs alone in vivo 168, 183. Instead, it arises only in the presence of the compensating S173A mutation that nearly fully rescues R264K-mediated replicative costs183. Likewise, the B*57-associated Gag T242N mutation has a very modest impact on viral replication capacity that becomes progressively more severe as additional B*57-associated escape mutations also accumulate 184-186. However, these additional escape mutations are paired with compensatory mutations that lessen their impact on viral replication capacity186. While escape from HIV-specific CTL responses has overall negative implications for the host - indeed, loss of the immunodomi nant Gag KK10 epitope in B*27-expressing individuals following selection of the R264K escape mutation is associated with progression to AIDS 176 - selection of fitness-costly CTL escape mutations can dampen the extent of negative impact and in some cases possibly even provide some residual benefit 168. Lower HIV replication capacity for example is associated with lower viral load and CD4+ T-cell decline187-190. Moreover, individuals who express 'protective' HLA 14 alleles that are associated with slower HIV disease progression113-116, 118, 119, most notably elite controllers who naturally suppress viral replication to undetectable levels107, tend to select for CTL escape mutations that either attenuate viral replication capacity or reduce the function of key viral proteins 178, 191-194. 1.10. Relevance of CTL Escape for HIV Vaccine Design The observation that certain CTL escape mu tations come at a replicative cost to the virus initially gave rise to the idea that vaccines designed to elicit CTL responses against such critical viral sites may be effective, if not in preventing infection, in eliciting durable HIV control 168, 195. The selection of immunogens to generate such responses is however complex, and several approaches have been pursued196. 'Conserved element' vaccines feature immunogens from highly conserved regions of the HIV genome197-199 under the assumption that such regions are immunogenic, and that selection of CTL escape mutations in these regions w ill be fitness costly to the virus 168, 197-199. While epitopes whose targeting is associated with lower viral loads do tend to be more conserved197, the relationship between HIV-1 sequence conservation and fitness costs of mutation is not uniform199. 'Mosaic' vaccine immunogens aim to maximize HIV-1 sequence diversity coverage with the goal of eliciting a strong, broad CTL response against both susceptible and common escaped viral forms that will control viral replication and limit HIV's ability to muta te away from this response via common pathways 168, 200. Eliciting CTL responses against escape mutants is however challenging168, as many, particularly those that abrogate epitope-HLA binding, lead to complete loss of CTL recognition186. As such, identification of sites in the HIV genome under HLA-mediated selective pressures and the mechanisms behind HLA-mediated immune escape is critical to CTL vaccine immunogen design. Indeed, failure of the STEP 201, 202 and RV144203 vaccine trials to elicit CTL-mediated protection underscores the need for refinement of this, and other196, aspects of vaccine design. 1.11. Population-level Identification of HLA-associated Polymorphisms The early realization that CTL escape mutations were largely reproducible based on host HLA led to the realization that these escape mutations could be systematically 15 identified, in an unbiased way, by analyzing large population-level datasets of host HLA Class I alleles linked to HIV genotype data, by statistical association. The first such study analyzed a dataset of 473 HIV-1 subtype B Reverse Transcriptase sequences linked to host HLA class I types, and identified 64 significant positive associations between HIV polymorphisms and HLA alleles, demonstrating widespread evidence of HIV adaptation to HLA-restricted responses at the population level 204. HIV residues identified as being statistically associated with a given HLA allele are referred to as \"HLA-associated polymorphisms\", whereas those experimentally verified to confer CTL escape in individuals with specific HLA alleles are termed \"HLA-associated escape mutations\". However, this initial study used standard statistical association methods that assume independence of observations (in th is case, the HIV sequences) , thus failing to account for the sequences' shared ancestry 205, 206. Violating this assumption made it impossible to confirm whether a given HLA-associated polymorphism had been selected in the current host (which would support reproducible HLA-driven selection of mutations), or had been transmitted from previous hosts (which could instead point to founder effects) 205. To overcome this confounding effect, later studies seeking to identify HLA- associated polymorphisms using such approaches corrected for the underlying phylogenetic relationships between the HIV sequences in the dataset 171, 206, 207. Here, the null hypothesis that the observed HIV polymorphism in the present host is the result of neutral evolution along the phylogeny is tested against the alternative hypothesis that the polymorphism was selected due to HLA-mediated selective pressures in the current host 171, 207. Such approaches tested for associations between each HLA and each HIV polymorphism in the dataset while also considering other possible confounders such as co-varying amino acids and HLA linkage dis equilibrium, and correct ing for multiple comparisons, thereby identifying HLA-asso ciated polymorphisms in a comprehensive and unbiased way 171, 207, 208. Most of these studies also adopted standardized nomenclature: HLA-associated polymorphisms that are statistically over-represented in individuals with a given HLA allele were termed 'adapted', and presumed to represent CTL escape mutations, while HLA-associated pol ymorphisms that are statistically under- represented in individuals with a given HLA allele were termed 'non-adapted', and presumed to represent the HLA-susceptible form 171. Since their first application to this problem in 2007205, phylogenetically-corrected approaches have been applied to identify HLA-associated polymorphisms in the subtype 16 B epidemics of Canada, the United States and Australia170, 171, 206, 208, Japan209 and Mexico210, as well as the subtype C211 and CRF01_AE212, 213 epidemics in South Africa and South East Asia, respectively. Selection of HLA-associated polymorphisms in other HIV subtypes and host populations however remains understudied. 1.12. Influence of Host Popul ation Genetics on Selection of HLA-associated Polymorphisms Given that immune escape mutations are reproducibly selected based on the host HLA Class I alleles expressed by an individual, then HLA-associated polymorphisms selected in a population will reflect the HL A alleles within that population 168. This in turn influences which epitopes may be ideal for inclusion in region- and/or population-specific CTL-based vaccines. Population-specific HIV adaptation to HLA is illustrated perfectly by the HIV- 1 epidemics in Canada, the United States, Australia, Japan and Mexico, where subtype B predominates but population HLA alleles differ greatly: more than 50% of HLA-associated polymorphisms identified in Mexico 210 and Japan209 differed from those identified in Canada, the United States and Australia due to this phenomenon168. Further, host population immunogenetics influence not only the nature of HLA-associated polymorphism selected in a given population, but also their prevalence in the population168. The I135X mutation in Reverse Transcriptase, which is located at the C-terminus of the Pol TI8 epi tope (RT codons 128-135), and is selected by HLA-B*51 (as well as HLA-B*52), provides an excellent example of this phenomenon, as I135X frequency correlates nearly perfectly with the frequency of its restricting allele(s) in different host populations globally 214. In fact, the escape variant 135T is the consensus residue in the Japanese HIV epidemic wher e HLA-B*51 and B*52 expression is extremely high214, as well as a regional epidemic in Canada where the host B*51 frequency is high215, whereas in all other regions w here HIV subtype B predominates and B*51 prevalence is relatively low, the consensus is the expected \"I\" at this position 216. Observations such as this supported the notion that CTL-based vaccine designs may need to take into consideration the HLA Class I allele profiles of the population in the delivery region. 17 1.13. Influence of Viral Genetic Context on Selection of HLA- associated Polymorphisms Though host (and host population) HLA genetics clearly influence HIV polymorphism, the influence of the viral genetic context on the selection of HLA-associated polymorphisms was less well understood, though evidence that HIV subtype influences viral evolution (including drug resistance) 217-226, pathogenesis227-231 and immunity232-237 suggests that it plays an important role. Indeed, one reason why the rate of HIV disease progression varies by HIV subtype may be because the sequence of certain key epitopes can vary between subtypes , which in turn can impact HLA-mediated viremia control 232, 235, 236. HLA-B*35 for example is associated with faster disease progression in subtype B, but not subtype C, partly because the subtype B consensus sequence in the critical Gag NY10 epitope has reduced affinity for B*35 235. Subtype- specific fitness constraints have also been shown to impact CTL escape mutation selection. HLA-B*57/58:01 esc ape in the Gag KF11 epitope for example differs between subtypes B and C: the A163G mutation, wh ich is commonly selected in subtype C, significantly reduces viral replication in subtype B, where S173T is instead commonly selected 234, 237. Likewise, the Gag TW10 escape variant M250I is readily selected in subtype C but not subtype B because it hinders viral replication in subtype B233. Differential escape also occurs between subtype A1 and D in the Gag TW10, KF11 and IW9 epitopes 238, 239, though the mechanisms behind these differences are incompletely known. While viral genetic context likely influences HLA-driven evolution in HIV, which in turn influences which CTL epitopes may be most relevant to include in subtype-specific CTL vaccines, no population-level studies had been undertaken at the time that I began graduate studies, particularly between HIV subtypes common in geographic regions with the highest HIV incidence. Mechanistic investigations into observed differences also remained limited. As such, Chapter 2 of this thesis describes the first population-level identification of HLA-associated polymorphi sms in HIV-1 subtypes A1 and D, two understudied subtypes that co-circulate in Uganda. It also represents the first population-level comparison of HLA-mediated selection pressure between these subtypes, formally investigating the contribution of the viral genetic context pl ays in HLA-mediated selection pressure, and investigating some of the mechanisms behind their selection. 18 1.14. The Persistent Reservoir as a Barrier to an HIV Cure Alongside ongoing efforts in HIV vaccine development, the past decade has also seen substantial growth in research to ac hieve cART-free HIV remission or cure. These strategies too will need to contend with HIV' s extensive within- and between-host genetic diversity. While most HIV-infected cells die shortly fo llowing infection, either directly from viral cytopathic effects or from immune-mediated killing240, a small minority, harbouring stably integrated provirus es, persist long-term23-26. These persisting cells form the viral reservoir, which will rapidly re-seed infection if ART is discontinued21, 22. Adherence to ART is therefore required for life, and curing HIV will require elimination or permanent silencing of this reservoir29. To date, at least eight people are believed to have been cured of HIV or to have attained a stat e of durable ART-free remission, providing landmark successes that demonstrat e the possibility of an HIV cure and provide critical insights into how this can be achieved. Timoth y Ray Brown, the \"Berlin Patient\", was the first person cured of HIV30, who, following two allogeneic stem-cell transplants from a CCR532/32 donor, in a final effort to cure his treatment-refractive acute myeloid leukemia and potentially also cure his HIV, remained HIV-free from 2008 until his death 12 years later in 2020 when his cancer recu rred. The \"London Patient\", Adam Castillejo, joined Timothy Brown in 2019 as the second person cured of HIV 31, also following allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. The same year an allogeneic stem-cell transplant-mediated cure was also reported in a Dusseldorf man 241, 242 and in 2022 the \"City of Hope Patient\" became the fourth person cured of HIV using this method243, though the period of follow-up for the latter individual is still relatively short (approximately 2 years). Stem-cell transplantation is however not a sca lable method to achieve an HIV cure due to safety, cost and feasibility concerns241. Durable HIV remission has been achieved in a Spanish women following administration of several immunomodulatory agents, though virus capable of reseeding HIV viremia is still detectable ex vivo in this individual244. More recently two women, the \"San Francisco Patient\" and the \"Esperanza Patient\", have been functionally cured of HIV after their immune systems naturally eradicated all HIV capable of reseeding viremia, joining a Sydney Blood Bank Cohort man who, through the combined effects of a strong natural anti-HIV immune response, partial 19 resistance to some HIV variants, protective HLA Class I alleles and infection with a weakened HIV variant, has been cured of HIV for over 20 years245. Every additional report offers renewed hope that a scalable HIV cure may one day be possible, and gives further insight into how this may be achieved. Numerous strategies to achieve ART-free remission or cure are being explored. Major approaches include \"Block and Lock\" 246, which aims to permanently silence proviruses, for example through Tat inhibition247 so they cannot reseed viremia. Other strategies involve gene therapy. Some of these approaches aim to engineer immune cells that are resistant to HIV infection, for example by using Zinc finger nuclease or CRISPR-mediated approaches to knock out CCR5 expression on CD4+ T-cells 248-250. Others use to inactivate (or excise) the provirus from reservoir-harbouring cells 251, 252. Among the most widely considered approaches however is the \"Shock and Kill\" strategy253, a two-pronged approach which aims to reactivate the reservoir using latency-reversing agents while also boosting the immune system's ability to eliminate these cells. With respect to the latter, recent data also indicate that administration of broadly neutralizing antibodies may enhance immune-mediated elimination of reservoir cells 254-257, including findings that delivery of 3BNC117 at ART initiation enhanced elimination of plasma HIV and infected cells, enhanced HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses and was also associated with sustained ART-free virologic control, among participants with 3BNC117-sensitive virus 258. In order to design strategies to eliminate the reservoir however, we must first develop an in-depth understanding of the genetically diverse within-host pool of proviruses that persist despite ART, and the dynamic processes that lead to its formation and persistence. 1.15. Dynamics of the Persistent Reservoir 1.15.1. Formation and Seeding of the Persistent Reservoir The persistent reservoir begins to form essentially immediately after HIV transmission ( Figure 1-6) . SIV models demonstrate that, even when treated within 3 days of infection before plasma viremia can be detected, rhesus macaques intra-rectally- infected with SIV mac251 will experience viral rebound upon tr eatment cessation as a result of reactivation from a persistent reservoir259. Additional early evidence came from a paediatric HIV infection case, the \"Mississippi Child\", an infant with detectable HIV DNA 20 and RNA who began ART within 30 hours of birth 260. ART (and viremia suppression) was maintained for the following 15-18 months, after which ART was discontinued. Viremia rebound did not occur for another 27 months 260, demonstrating the existence of a small, yet long-lived, reservoir despite ex tremely early treatment initiation. While the Mississippi Child achieved sustained viral remission for some time off-ART, this is not the norm however, as even children who initiated ART very early and who maintained suppression for many years typically ex perience rapid viral rebound following ART cessation 261. The same is true in adults: though early ART initiation significantly limits reservoir size262 and in some cases can delay viral recrudescence following ART cessation263-266, rebound nevertheless occurs. Seeding of the persistent reservoir cont inues throughout untreated infection. Evidence supporting this comes from studies demonstrating strong correlations between reservoir size, genetic diversity, and duration of unt reated infection267-274, as well as the routine recovery of within-host variants from throughout untreated infection when the proviral pool is sampled during long-term ART 275-280. Indeed, since the within-host HIV quasispecies diversifies rapidly and continuously throughout untreated infection73-75, and since within-host HIV sequences continually enter the reservoir during this time273, 274, 278, early investigations that sought to interpret on-ART proviral composition in the context of the individual's pre-ART HIV evolutionary history sought to investigate whether the reservoir truly preserved the full spectrum of viral variants ever generated within an individual 275, 276. If so, and if this level of diversity was very high, this could represent an even greater challenge for HIV cure interventions, particularly those aiming to enhance naturally-occurring immune responses to eliminate reservoir cells. As such, investigation into within-host reservoir genetic composition and the factors shaping it over time are critical. 21 Figure 1-6 Formation of the persistent reservoir starts early, and continues throughout, untreated HIV inf ection, where the fate of proviruses thereafter is variable. Following infection, plasma vi ral load (green line) increases and subsequently reaches a set point. HIV diversifies rapidly in to a pool of closely related vi ral variants (coloured viruses). Throughout this time, these variants are archiv ed to the persistent reservoir as integrated proviruses (coloured genome) in the host cell (gre y). The fate (denoted '?') of each of these integrated proviruses once they enter into the rese rvoir is however variable and influenced by a variety of host and viral factors (see Figure 1-7). 1.15.2. Genomic Integrity of the Persistent Reservoir Initial reports describing the existence of a persistent reservoir were based on the discovery that CD4+ T-cells isolated from individuals on ART could be readily induced, in vitro, to produce infectious HIV using an approach now commonly referred to as the Quantitative Viral Outgrowth Assay (QVOA)23-26, 281. This assay provides an estimate of infectious HIV units per million CD4+ T-cells (IUPM). The overwhelming majority of proviruses persisting during ART howev er cannot produce infectious HIV 282. This is because they harbour gross genetic defects, such as large deletions or hypermutation, which render them incapable of producing r eplication-competent virus. The earliest evidence confirming this came from a study that performed near-full-length sequencing of individual proviruses from cells that failed to yield replication competent virus in viral outgrowth assays, revealing that roughly 90% contained gross defects 283. Later studies, which further improved on methods to isolate and sequence individual near-full length proviruses 284, 285 and more definitively classify them as intact or defective indicated that 22 in fact only 2-5% of proviruses persisting on ART are intact284, though this percentage can vary substantially between individuals as well as by infection stage at ART initiation282. The extremely high proportion of defecti ve proviruses however means that reservoir size estimates determined using the Quantitative Viral Outgrowth Assay281, which only measures cells harbouring intact HIV genomes that successfully reactivate after in vitro stimulation, are on average more than 2 log 10 lower than estimates derived from PCR-based assays that target a single vi ral region, which measure all proviruses for which the target is intact, even if the provirus has defects elsewhere286. Defective proviruses contain a variety of different flaws. The most common defects are large genomic deletions: consistently 70-90% of proviruses recovered from individuals on long-term ART have large deletions spanning most of the HIV coding region 282-285, 287, 288. These deletions arise during reverse transcription of HIV RNA from the incoming virion, resulting in integration of a provirus that is missing a large portion of the viral genome. Proviruses rendered replic ation incompetent by APOBEC3G-induced hypermutation typically make up 10% or less of the persisting proviral pool 282-285, 287, 288. Proviruses with defects in their packaging signal ( ) and/or multiple splice donor (MSD) site, key RNA elements located in the 5' long te rminal repeat region of the viral genome, consistently represent 5-10% of proviruses282-285, 287, 288. Though these regions are relatively short, they are critical: the packaging signal recruits genomic RNAs to newly forming virions 289, and reconstructed infectious molecular clones of viruses containing deletions in this region are unable to replicate in vitro283, as are those with point mutations in their MSD283. Proviruses with other defects such as gene inversions, scrambles (where genes or gene regions are in the wrong order in the genome), premature stop codons or human-HIV chimeras have also been recovered. The within-host distribution of proviruses with these different defects varies somewhat between individuals 282-285, 287, 288, and may also vary based on the specific analysis pipeline used for genomic integrity classifica tion (as many proviruses will have multiple defects, but most pipelines feature a decisi on tree that will classify a pr ovirus into a single category only)290. Proviruses lacking any of these defects are considered genomically intact and therefore theoretically capable of reactivating from the reservoir at any time to produce infectious HIV. Though the lar ge pool of defective proviruses can contribute to pre-ART plasma HIV RNA291, and may contribute to ongoing low-level immune activation during ART292-294, suggesting that it may play a relevant role in HIV pathogenesis, HIV cure 23 interventions primarily seek to eliminate the much smaller subset of replication- competent reservoir sequences288. Being able to accurately identify, and quantify, these sequences, and achieving an understanding of their within-host diversity and unique features, is therefore paramount. 1.16. Reservoir Quantification Until recently, the Quantitative Viral Outgrowth Assay (QVOA) was the gold standard for reservoir quantification295. This assay involves the ex vivo reactivation and culture of virus from serially-diluted CD4+ T- cells isolated from individuals living with HIV, whereby the frequency of virus-positive wells at each serial dilution can be used to estimate the number of replication competent HIV copies per million CD4+ T-cells in the infected individual 295, 296. While QVOA is selective for intact, replication-competent virus, it is poorly scalable: it requires large number s of CD4+ T-cells, and it is time, resource and labour intensive295. Moreover, a single round of stimulation is often insufficient to reactivate all replication-competent virus pr esent, so this assay routinely underestimates the size the replication-competent reservoir297. Another concern is that virus readily reactivated from the reservoir in vitro in this assay may not be representative of virus that reseeds viremia following ART cessation298, though it is not clear whether this is due to a bias in the subset of cells that is capable of reactivation in vitro, or because the cellular source of rebound viremia is not usually located in blood 299. Other assays in part addressing the scalability chall enges of QVOA have been developed, such HIV DNA quantification300, gag-specific ddPCR301, TILDA302 and AluPCR303. However, none of these assays are selective for intact proviruses. The Intact Proviral DNA Assay (IPDA)288 was recently developed to address the need for a scalable, selective assay to quantify the intact persistent HIV reservoir. The IPDA is a duplexed droplet digital PCR assay targeting two sites in the HIV genome likely to be missing or mutated in defective proviruses, thus allowing for the selective quantification of intact proviruses 288. Human DNA is also quantified in parallel, allowing Intact HIV copies per million CD4+ T-cells to be calculated288. This assay has since rapidly been adopted in both research and clinical studies globally258. The sequence of the two primer and probes sets used in the IP DA however were originally designed using a limited number of HIV subtype B sequences from cohorts in the United States288. Moreover, while the IPDA represents a major advance in the field, any molecular assay 24 that requires multiple oligonucleotides to bind to the genome of a highly genetically variable pathogen is likely to experience challenges in accurately detecting all strains. Indeed, this was the case for the IPDA. Chapter 3 of this thesis therefore describes an investigation of the impact of both with in- and between-host HIV diversity in the application of the IPDA, and strategies towards overcoming these challenges. 1.17. Pre-ART and on-ART Reservoir Modulation While seeding of the persistent reservoir begins early and continues throughout untreated infection, its composition is fa r from static. Indeed, HIV sequences are continually being purged from the reservoir, for example through immune-mediated elimination or cell death from virus cytopathic effects following proviral reactivation 240. Recent studies have revealed however, that this rate of \"turn over\" of the reservoir is much more rapid during untreated infection compared to during ART. One study, from 2016 in a predominantly HIV subtype B cohort, estimated that the half-life of persisting proviral DNA during untreated infection to be approximately 0.75 years 275. This estimate was broadly similar to that in a cohort of participants from Zambia with HIV subtype C, where pre-ART proviral half-life was estimat ed at a median 0.78 years (range 0.45- 2.28 years) 304. A recent study of Kenyan women with HIV super-infection produced a slightly longer estimate, of 2.1 (range 0.58- 5. 7) years during untreated infection279. Estimates of pre-ART proviral turnover rates were more variable in a small cohort of viremic controllers with HIV subtype B, ranging from less than one year to virtually no decay, depending on the individual 273. It is also important to note that all of these estimates were derived from analyses of sub-genomic (ra ther than full-length) HIV sequences, many of which likely contain defects elsewhere in the genome, and therefore that these estimates represent the half-life of the broade r pool of defective persisting proviruses during untreated infection. In contrast, estimates of proviral half- life during long-term ART are substantially longer. Initial studies of the half-life of t he intact, replication competent reservoir produced an estimated half-life of 44 months (3.7 years) 281, while initial studies of the overall (predominantly defective) proviral pool estimated an average on-ART half-life of 12 years, though this ranged from 6- 240 years depending on the participant305. More recent studies using the Intact Proviral DNA Assay (IPDA, see section 1.16, above) have further revealed on-ART reservoir decay to be biphasic, where an inflection point occurs 25 approximately seven years following ART initiati on after which proviral turnover further slows306. Specifically, the half-life of intact provir uses was estimated at four years in the first seven years following ART initiation and nearly 19 years thereafter, whereas the half-life of defective proviruses was estimated at 17 years for the first 7 years and 45 years thereafter 306. Application of this and similar reservoir quantification methods, as well as longitudinal sequencing307, to other cohorts produced similar decay rate estimates308-312. The discrepancy between proviral decay rate s pre- and on-ART is believed to be attributable to marked reductions in inflammatory conditions that occur upon ART initiation313 which promote the stability of persistently-infected cells277, 314, 315. This phenomenon is also believed to be responsible for the observation that proviruses persisting during long-term ART are typically skewed towards viruses that integrated in the year or two prior to ART initiation, with viruses dating to earlier periods of untreated infection usually being less abundant (see sect ion 1.19, below). Nevertheless, the discovery that reservoir composition is highly dynamic both pre- and on-ART underscores the need to understand these dynam ics, and the factors driving these changes. 1.18. Mechanisms of Persistence and Reservoir Composition Alteration 1.18.1. Homeostatic Proliferation, Clonal Expansion and Integration Site The within-host CD4+ T-cell repertoire is sustained through homeostatic proliferation, the process whereby a cell divides without antigenic stimulation in order to preserve itself 316-318. This process is somewhat dysregulated in HIV, as infection- mediated decreases in IL-7 receptor expression, combined with chronic immune activation and immune exhaustion limit the proliferative capacity of CD4+ T-cells 319-323. To counterbalance this, IL-7 expression is up-r egulated in HIV infection in an effort to drive CD4+ T-cell proliferation, thereby promoting the persi stence and survival of cells harbouring an HIV-1 provirus314, 324, 325. Homeostatic proliferation is therefore one mechanism in which the reservoir sustains itself, as any provirus integrated into a CD4+ T-cell will therefore be passed on to all daughter cells 326 (Figure 1-7) . 26 It is now appreciated that one of the major ways in which the reservoir sustains itself is through clonal expansion. Clonal expansion is the process by which CD4+ T-cells significantly proliferate in response to stimulation by their cognate antigen, producing many clonal daughter cells 294, 327, 328. If the cell harbours an HIV provirus, then this will generate a population of identical CD4+ T-cell clo nes, each harbouring the same Figure 1.7) . Clonally expanded identical sequences make a significant contribution to the persisti ng proviral pool in most individuals283-285, 307, 329-332 and make up an increasingly large portion of the reservoir over time333-335. Clonally expanded sequences can arise early in infection336 and both intact297, 327, 329, 337, 338 and defective282, 283 clones have been recovered. Following cl earance of the antigen, clonally expanded populations will contract, and indeed th is dynamic \"waxing and waning\" of provirus-harbouring CD4+ T-cell cl onal populations has been described 330. Moreover, clonal expansion and contraction can result in expression of viral RNA, leading to intermittent viremia during otherwise suppressive ART 339. The likelihood of clonal expansion is also linked to the site of proviral integration in the human genome. HIV preferentially integrates into the introns of highly-expressed genes in gene dense regions 340-342 as a result of the interaction of the HIV capsid with the host cell protein CPSF6343, which mediates passage into the nucleus, and HIV Integrase with LEDGF/p75344, a chromatin binding factor associated with actively transcribed genes. However, integration into specific genes associated with cell growth, proliferation and survival, clonal expansion in the reservoir 333-335, 345-347. Proviral integration site may also in fluence HIV persistenc e, and therefore the within-host proviral landscape over time ( Figure 1-7 ). Comparisons of integration site distribution between in vitro infected PBMCs and CD4+ T-cells isolated from individuals on ART indicate that integration sites in the most highly expressed genes were underrepresented in the latter, suggesting that proviruses integrated in highly expressed genes are selected against in vivo347. Moreover, integration site analysis of the reservoirs of elite controllers revealed a marked enrichment in integrations within transcriptionally inactive hos t genome regions, such as centromeric satellite DNA and Kruppel- associated box chromatin containing zinc finger genes, both of which are associated with heterochromatin features 348. Integration sites were also further from 27 transcriptional start sites and accessible chromatin in the host genome, and were enriched for repressive marks348. Intact proviruses in elite controllers are also more commonly integrated in heterochromatin r egions compared to defective proviruses349. While this suggests that distinctive integration site distribution is an additional mechanism of HIV elite control 348, it also suggests that proviral integration in transcriptionally inactive or less active gene regions can promote proviral persistence. Together, homeostatic proliferation, clonal ex pansion and proviral integration site can modulate the composition of the persistent reservoir over time, altering the diversity therein that must be eliminated. 1.18.2. Immune Recognition, Evasion and Preferential Elimination The immune response represents another force that continually shapes reservoir composition, even during ART ( Figure 1-7 ). Proviruses in the persistent reservoir can express both HIV RNA328, 350 and proteins292, 351 and can be recognized and eliminated by the host CTL response352-354, though there is evidence that some persisting proviruses exhibit inherent resistance to CTL-mediated elimination355. Even cells harbouring defective proviruses can express RNA293 and proteins292, 354, and be recognized and killed by host CTLs354. Indeed, maintenance of Nef-specific CTL responses during long-term suppressive ART suggests that the reservoir remains \"visible\" to the immune system during this time356. Though many proviruses harbour immune escape mutations in CTL epitopes that may aid their survival should the cells harbouring them reactivate 352, a substantial portion of reservoir sequences have no detectable escape mutations357 and sequences with escape mutations do not appear to be increasing over time308, suggesting that immune escape may not represent a major facilitator of proviral persistence. Substantial evidence suggests that selective pressure on the reservoir may vary by genomic integrity and the presence of specific genomic elements, in turn influencing the ability of specific proviruses to persist. As previously mentioned, intact proviruses decline more quickly from the reservoir than defective ones 306, 308-312 (see section 1.17), where the former decay at a rate of approximately 16% per year in the first seven years following ART-initiation and 4% thereafter and the latter at a rate of 4% per year in the first seven years following ART-initiation and 1.5% per year thereafter 306. Decay rates 28 also differ between defective proviral types, where those with 3' defects are gradually eliminated over time while those 5' region defects remain relatively stable in frequency 306. Longitudinal sequencing also suggests that intact proviruses, as well as those with genomic elements promoting protein expression, such as splice donor and acceptor sites, also decrease in frequency over time, but those without these elements tend to stably persist 307. Moreover, the presence of an intact nef gene may promote proviral persistence through a role in immune evasion358. As genomic integrity plays an important role in HIV persi stence, understanding its impact on proviral longevity, and concomitantly on reservoir composition, remains critical.

Reservoir Composition after Long-term ART At the time that I initiated my PhD, only one study had attempted to interpret individuals' on-ART proviral landscapes in context of their with in-host, pre-ART HIV evolutionary histories275, an approach essential to fully understanding on-ART reservoir 29 composition and longevity. Since then, a grow ing number of studies, including from our group, have addressed this knowledge gap by applying within-host phylogenetic approaches to this question 275-279. Broadly, these studies have revealed that on-ART proviral pools are typically skewed towards variants that integrated in the year or two prior to ART initiation 275, 277-279, but the extent of this skewing varies widely, and proviruses dating to earlier periods of infection are recovered in nearly all individuals studied 275-279. In one recent study of 13 women with HIV subtype C for example, the percentage of proviruses archived within one y ear prior to ART initiation ranged from 17- 100% between participants, where in one participant a particularly old provirus was recovered that dated to the time of their sero-conversion277. However, all but one of these studies solely used sub-genomic proviral sequences derived from proviruses of unknown - but likely defective - genomic integrity 275, 276, 278, 279, while the remaining study solely used sequences from ex vivo reactivated, replication-competent virus277. Moreover, the extent of skewing observed in the study that investigated replication-competent virus 277 appeared more dramatic than the studies that investigated sub- genomic (and likely largely defective) HIV sequences275, 276, 278, 279, further suggesting that genomic integrity may influence proviral persistence and survival - but no studies to date have simultaneously collected both intact and defective sequences to determine whether proviral age distribution differs by genomic integrity. Chapter 4 of this thesis therefore uses within-host phylogenetic reconstruction approaches to simultaneously investigate the age distribution a variety of persisting HIV sequences of varying genomic integrity, including sequences from in vivo and ex vivo reactivation events, to address this knowledge gap. 1.20. The COVID-19 pandemic and its Impact on my PhD research Following initial reports of a novel cor onavirus-related disease in late 2019, the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020. In response to public health efforts to manage the pandemic in British Columbia, which included social distancing measures and restrictions on non-essential wo rk, the Simon Fraser University campus and laboratories were closed to all non-COVI D-19 research activities in April 2020. Rather than stay home, I, along with many other students and scientists, placed my PhD research on hold for the following 12-16 mont hs and instead pivoted my skills to COVID- 30 19 research. During that time I had the opportunity to contribute to COVID-19 clinical and diagnostic research projects, which in some cases helped support changes in practice and policy and resulted in three publications on which I am first or co-first author (each included in Appendix B of this thesis). Following this, I returned to my original thesis work focusing on HIV. 31 References 1. Control CfD. MMWR- Pneumo cystis Pneumonia\u2014 Los Angeles.

Abstract The extent to which viral genetic cont ext influences HIV adaptation to Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I-restricted immune pressures remains incompletely understood. The Ugandan HIV epidemic, where major pandemic group M subtypes A1 and D co-circulate in a single host population, pr ovides an opportunity to investigate this question. We characterized plasma HIV RNA gag, pol and nef sequences, along with host HLA genotypes, in 464 antiretroviral-na\u00efve individuals chronically infected with HIV subtypes A1 or D. Using phylogenetically-inf ormed statistical approaches, we identified HLA-associated polymorphisms and formally compared their strengths of selection between viral subtypes. A substantial number (32%) of HLA-associated polymorphisms identified in subtypes A1 and/or D had previous ly been reported in subtypes B, C and/or Circulating Recombinant Form (CRF) 01_AE, confirming the shared nature of many HLA-driven escape pathways regardless of viral genetic context. Nevertheless, 34% of identified HLA-associated polymorphisms were significantly differentially selected between subtypes A1 and D. Experimental invest igation of select examples of subtype- specific escape revealed distinct underlying mechanisms with important implications for vaccine design: whereas some were attributable to subtype-specific sequence variation that influenced epitope-HLA binding, others were attributable to differential mutational barriers to immune escape. Overall, our resu lts confirm HIV genetic context as a key modulator of viral adaptation to host cellular immunity and highlight the power of combined bioinformatic and mechanistic studies, paired with knowledge of epitope immunogenicity, to identify appropriate viral regions for inclusion in subtype-specific and universal HIV vaccine strategies. 2.3. Importance The identification of HIV polymorphisms reproducibly selected under pressure by specific HLA alleles, and the elucidation of th eir impact on viral function, can help identify immunogenic viral regions where immune escape incurs a fitness cost. However, our knowledge of HLA-driven escape pathways and their functional costs is largely limited to 61 HIV subtype B, and to a lesser extent C. Our study represents the first characterization of HLA-driven adaptation pathways in HIV subtypes A1 and D, which dominate in East Africa, and the first statistically rigorous characterization of differential HLA-driven escape across viral subtypes. Results support a considerable impact of viral genetic context on HIV adaptation to hos t HLA, where HIV subtype-sp ecific sequence variation influences both epitope-HLA binding and the fitness costs of escape. Integrated bioinformatic and mechanistic characterization of these and other instances of differential escape could aid rational CTL-based vaccine immunogen selection for both subtype-specific and universal HIV vaccines. 2.4. Introduction Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I-restricted CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) evolutionary pressure on an HIV-infected individual's viral quasispecies, driving the selection of reproducible mutational pathways 1-4. Using population-based approaches, HLA-associated polymorphisms in HIV, many of which have been experimentally confirmed as immune escape mutations, have been comprehensively mapped across subtype B 5-9 and to a lesser extent subtype C and Circulating Recombinant Form (CRF) 01_AE 10-13. However, our knowledge of HLA-driven escape in other ma jor HIV subtypes, as well as the extent to which the viral genetic context modulates these pathways, remains limited. It is also well-established that the immune evasion benefits of some escape mutations are offset by costs to viral replication and/or protein function 14-23. A leading CTL-based HIV vaccine strategy aims to focus immune responses against such \"constrained\" regions 24; novel approaches to identify them within the diverse HIV subtypes 25 would thus be useful. Characterization of HLA-driven adaptation pathways across HIV subtypes is even more relevant given the accumulating evidence that HIV subtype modulates viral evolution 26-29, pathogenesis 30-34 and immunity 35-40. Notably, infecting HIV subtype influences the rate of clinical progression in untreated infection 30- 37. Though the mechanisms underlying these effects are incompletely known, differential HLA-mediated viremia control as a result of sequence variation in key HIV CTL epitopes contributes at least in part 35-37. HLA-B*35 expression for example is associated with faster progression in subtype B, but not C, infection in part because the subtype B consensus sequence of the key NY10 epit ope (Gag codons 253- 262) has reduced 62 affinity for B*35 37. Instances of differential HLA-driven escape mutations across viral subtypes, attributable to viral backbone-specific fitness constraints 38-40, have also been described. For example, HLA-B*57/58:01-dri ven escape in KF11 (Gag 162-172) occurs via A163G in subtype C but S173T in subt ype B, as the former compromises viral replication in a subtype B backbone 38, 39; similarly M250I, located one codon downstream of TW10 (Gag 240-249) is readily se lected in subtype C but only rarely in subtype B where it attenuates viral replication 40. Differential HLA-B*57-associated escape within the KF11, IW9 (Gag 147-155) and TW10 epitopes has also been described between subtypes A1 and D, though the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated 41, 42. A framework to identify viral regions that differ in immunogenicity between HIV subtypes, or where the functional costs of immune escape differ between HIV subtypes, could thus aid in vaccine design. We develop and apply such a framework here. We begin by characterizing pathways of HLA-mediated adaptation in HIV subtypes A1 and D, two understudied viral subtypes that co-circulate in East Africa for which HLA-driven escape pathways have not yet been elucidated. Next, using a novel phylogenetically-informed comparative statistical approach, we demonstrate that mo re than one-third of identified HLA-driven escape pathways are differentially select ed between these subtypes. Finally, we mechanistically investigate two instances of statistically significant differential escape between subtypes, and identify subtype-spec ific epitope-HLA binding and mutational constraints on immune escape as their likely causes. Our results confirm that viral genetic context modulates HIV adaptation to host cellular immunity and highlight the utility of integrated bioinformatic and molecular appr oaches to identify candidate epitopes for inclusion in subtype-specific and universal CTL-based HIV vaccines. 2.5. Results 2.5.1. Subtype A1 and D cohort subsets exhibit distinct HIV, but concordant host, genetic profiles Host population HLA class I allele frequencies influence the prevalence of HLA- associated polymorphisms in circulating HIV strains 10, 43-45. To avoid confounding by this and other host population-related fa ctors, studies attempting to identify differences in HLA-driven evolution across HIV subtypes must be undertaken in a single host 63 population where two or more viral subtypes co-circulate to substantial frequencies. Uganda, where HIV subtypes A1 and D co-circulate, represents such a locale. We began by amplifying and bulk sequencing plasma HIV RNA gag, polymerase (pol) and nef from 513 chronically HIV-infected antiretr oviral-naive participants of two established cohort studies 46-48. Pol was amplified in two segments: protease-reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase . Overall, 464 (90.4%) participants harboured a gag, pol and/or nef sequence that could be classified as \"pure\" s ubtype A1 or D. This included 257 (50%) subtype A1-infected participants, 185 (36%) s ubtype D-infected participants and 22 (4%) participants likely infected with a subtype A1/D recombinant but whose individual HIV genes could be classified as a single subtype ( e.g. a participant infected with a virus whose 5' and 3' halves were A1 and D respectively would be classified as A1 for Gag and D for Nef) ( Figure 2-1 ). The remaining 49 (10%) participants were excluded because they harboured other viral subtypes and/or inter-subtype recombinants where breakpoints occurred within the studied genes. In total, our analysis included 203 gag, 222 protease-RT , 200 integrase and 210 nef subtype A1 sequences, well as 134 gag, 154 , 140 integrase and 127 nef subtype 2-1 Maximum likelihood phylogenies A1 D protease-rt , integrase and nef datasets. protease-rt , 200 integrase and 210 nef sequences were collected. subtype D, 134 gag, 154 protease-rt , 140 integrase and 127 nef sequences were collected. 64 All sequences cluster according to their classified subtype (A1=black; D= green). All phylogenies are drawn on the same distance sca le; units are in estimated nucle otide substitutions per site. Critically, the HLA class I frequencies of the subtype A1 and D cohort subsets were highly comparable. Of the 106 total HLA-A, -B, and -C alleles observed, none differed significantly in frequency between cohort subsets at the predefined false discovery rate threshold of q<0.2 (all comparisons were p>0.05 except HLA-B*47:01 which was p=0.03) ( Figure 2-2 ). Figure 2-2 HLA class I allele frequencies in subtype A1 and D cohort subsets. HLA alleles present at >1% frequency in either are shown (subtype A1=black; subtype D=green). Cohort subsets di d not differ in the frequency of any HLA allele at q<0.2. The 22 (4%) individuals likely infected wi th recombinant subtype A1/D vi ruses, but for whom individual HIV gene fragments could never theless be classified as \"pure\" subtypes, were excluded from this analysis. 66 Cohort subsets were also generally well matched for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics ( Table 2-1 ). They did not differ significantly with respect to plasma viral load (pVL) (median [IQR] subtype A1: 5.2 [4.6-5.7] log 10 HIV RNA copies/mL, [4.6-5.5] log 10 D: 75%, p=0.15), though (median [IQR] subtype A1: 35 [30- 41] years, subtype D: years, p=0.02). Together, these results are c onsistent with HIV subtypes A1 and D co- circulating in a single host population, ther eby minimizing the potential for confounding by host-related differences between cohort subsets.

Identification of HLA-associated polymorphisms in HIV subtypes A1 and D Using phylogenetically-informed approaches (9, 49 and methods), we identified a total of 385 unique HLA-associated polymorphisms, occurring at 183 unique HIV codons, in subtype A1 and D Gag, Prot p<8x10-4 in subtype 2-3 and Extended Data File S1 [not shown]). Specific ally, 251 associations were identified at 123 codons in subtype A1 (55 [22%] in Gag, 11 [4 %] in Protease, 78 [31%] in RT, 52 [21%] Integrase and 55 [22%] in Nef), while 180 HLA-associated polymorphisms were identified at 105 codons in subtype D (36 [20%] in Gag, 5 [3%] in Protease, 47 [26%] in RT, 26 [14%] in Integrase and 66 [37%] in Nef). Consistent with previous observations in subtypes B and C and CRF01_AE 8-13, Nef exhibited the highest density of HLA- 67 polymorphisms. In subtype A1, 13% of Nef's harboured at RT to of codons in other viral proteins. In total, 32% of the 385 unique HLA-associated polymorphisms had been previously described in at least one other HIV subtype 9, 10, 12, 13, 45 (Extended Data File S1 [not shown]). HLA-A*03: 01-associated Gag K28Q located within the A*03:01-restricted RY10 epitope 50 and ranks among the strongest HLA associations identified in subtype B 9 and has also been described in subtype C 12, was among the strongest associations in subtype A1. We also observed numerous examples where the same HIV polymorphism is selected by more than one HLA allele. Gag K28Q in subtype A1 for example is also strongly se lected by HLA-A*30:01; this association has also been reported in subtypes B and C 9, 12. We also observed cases where HLA alleles exert opposing selection on HIV. S123D in RT in subtype A1 for example represents the adapted (inferred escaped) form for HLA- B*57:03, but the non-adapted (inferred susceptible) form for HLA-B*49:01. Clusters of mutations selected by the same HLA allele, which often denote the presence of novel CTL epitopes 7, were also observed. Nef Y102H and E108D in subtype A1 for example, are selected by HLA-B*44:03, supporting the existence of a novel B*44:03-restricted epitope here. Numerous HIV polymorphisms were selected by the same HLA in both subtypes A1 and D, for example HLA-C*07:01-associated Nef K105R which is also selected by this allele in subtypes B, C and CRF01_AE 9, 12, 13. Other HLA-associated polymorphisms were identified in only one subtype. Gag E161D for example, located one residue upstream of the HLA-B*57-restricted Gag KF11 epitope, was associated with HLA- B*57:03 in subtype D, whereas no HLA associat ions were identified at q<0.2 in subtype A1 at this site. 68 Figure 2-3 Immune escape maps of HLA-associated polymorphisms identified in subtypes A1 and D. HLA-associated polymor phisms identified in HIV subtype A1 (black subtype consensus sequence) are displayed above; t hose identified in subtype D (g reen consensus sequence) are shown below. HIV subtype consensus sequences were obtained from the Los Alamos HIV sequence database, aligned to the HXB2 reference strain and gap-stripped to preserve HXB2 codon numbering. HIV resi dues that are overrepresented amo ng individuals expr essing the given HLA allele are shown in red - these represent the HLA 'adapted' (inferred escaped) form. By contrast, HIV residues that are underrepresented in individuals expressing the given HLA allele 69 are shown in blue - these repres ent the 'non-adapted' (inferred susceptible) form for that HLA allele. Groups of polymorphisms in close proximity that are selected by the same HLA allele are boxed in yellow. HLA-associated HIV polymorphisms that do not su rvive correction for HIV codon co-variation are shown in lower case letters.

Substantial HIV subtype-specific adaptation to host HLA Though immune escape maps provide a convenient way to visualize HLA- associated HIV polymorphisms, they cannot be used to definitively identify viral sites under differential HLA-mediated selection between HIV subtypes. Even if the same association appears on multiple escape maps, its strength of sele ction may still differ between subtypes; conversely, the absence of a particular polymorphism on a given escape map may be simply because it narrowl y missed the predefined statistical cutoff. We therefore employed a novel modification of a phylogenetically-corrected logistic regression approach ( 9, 10, 49, 51 and methods) to identify instances of statistically significant differential HLA-mediated selection between HIV subtypes A1 and D. Briefly, we took the union of all polymorphisms identified in either subtype where 3 individuals in both cohort subsets carried the relevant HLA allele, in total 289 HLA-associated polymorphisms. We then assess ed whether, after controlling for other covariates, viral subtype represented a significant independent predictor of each HLA-associated viral polymorphism. If so, it was classified as differentially selected between subtypes. Overall, 34% (99 of 289) of polymorphis ms were differentially selected between subtypes A1 D at q<0.1 and , The proportion of HLA-associated polymorphisms that were differentially selected across subtypes A1 and D was not signifi cantly different across all viral proteins investigated (all p>0.05 by Fisher's exac t test). In descending order these were 71 Protease, where 60% (6/10) of polymorphisms polymorphisms exhibiting differential selection between subtypes A1 and D. The natural logarithm of the odds ratio (lnOR) of selecti on of HLA-associat ed polymorphisms in Gag, Nef, Protease, Reverse Transcriptase and In tegrase that were differentially selected between subtypes A1 (black) and D (green) are shown. The lnOR of a specific association is only shown if it was independently statistically significant in a given HIV subtype; otherwise it is set to 0. In most cases, differential selection of an HLA-associated po lymorphism occurred because the polymorphism is selected in one subtype but not the other (e.g. B*57:03-Gag T242N is significantly selected in subtype D with a lnOR of 5.6, but not in subtype A1). A small filled circle (\u0001) denotes cases where the same HIV polymorphism was selected at significantly different strengths in the two subtypes. For example, HLA-C*07:01 selects for Nef K105R in subtype A1 72 (lnOR= 2.3) but more strongly in subtype D (lnO R= 6). Polymorphisms differentially selected at a false discovery rate threshold of q<0.1 and p<0. 05 are shown. Infinite positive or negative lnORs were set to 6 or -6 respecti vely for visualization purposes. The vast majority of differentially sele cted viral polymorphisms (92 of 99; 93%) occurred because they were selected by the relevant HLA allele in one subtype but not the other (46 were selected in subtype A1 but not D and 46 vice-versa) ( Figure 2-4 ). epitope (codons 240-249), was among the strongest instances of differential selection identified. In subtype D, the odds ratio [OR] of selection of Gag T242N by B*57:03 is 268 (corresponding to 5.6 when expressed as a natural logarithm [lnOR]) whereas in subtype A1 the OR of this association is not significantly different than 1. Applying our test for differential escape bet ween HIV subtypes A1 and D for B*57:03- associated T242N thus yielded highly statistically significant selected in subtype D but not A1, represented the most significant instances of differential selection in these proteins respectively, while HLA-A*30:01-associated K281R in RT, selected in subtype A1 alone, was the most significant instance of differential selection in this protein (p=1.6x10-5; q=4x10-4). The remaining 7 instances of differentia l selection occurred when the same HLA allele selected the same polymorphism in both subtypes at significantly different strengths (3 were more strongly selected in subtype A1 than D, and 4 vice-versa) (Figure 2-4 ). For example, HLA-C*07:01 selected Nef K105R a in subtype D in subtype (intersubtype codon 97 with a lnOR= 4.2 in subtype A1 to lnOR= 3.6 in subty pe D (p=0.03; q=0.07). Results therefore indicate that, while HIV subtypes A1 and D di splay substantial overlap in their preferred mutational pathways for adaptation to host HLA (66% of identified polymorphisms were not differentially selected between the two subtypes), viral genetic context nevertheless plays a key role in defining these pathways. 73 2.5.4. Mechanisms underlying differential HLA-associated adaptation between HIV subtypes Understanding the mechanisms underlying differ ential escape is critical if we are to leverage this information for vaccine design. In particular, instances of differential escape attributable to epitope immunogenicity ( e.g. because a particular epitope binds poorly its cognate HLA in a given subtype) might identify less useful vaccine epitopes for a given viral subtype, while those attributable to higher mutational barriers to escape in a particular HIV subtype might identify more useful vaccine epitopes. We thus interpreted our list of differentially-selected viral polymorphisms ( Figure 2-4 ) in context of subtype- specific HIV genetic variation, published CTL epitope immunogenicity data, protein domain structural predictions and epitope/HLA binding predictions to identify candidates for mechanistic characterization. We identified HLA-B*57:03-associated Gag T242N as a candidate for differential escape due to subtyp e-specific fitness costs and HLA-B*15:03- associated Nef K105R as a candidate for di fferential escape due to subtype-specific differences in epitope/HLA binding. HIV subtype-specific functional constraints underlie some instances of differential escape: B*57:03-Gag T242N Gag TW10 is strongly and frequently recognized by B*57-expressing individuals infected with various HIV subtypes 15, 50, 52 including A1 and D 41, 53. However, whereas Gag T242N is reproducibly selected by B*57:03 in subtype D (and others 9, 45), it is not selected by this allele in subtype A1 ( Figure 2-4 ), despite our cohort being sufficiently powered to detect it (see discussion). Notably, the subtype A1 consensus differs from that of all other major subtypes and CRFs at Gag codon 243, the residue immediately downstream of the mutation site: 75% of subtype A1 sequences harbour Proline whereas >97% of sequences belonging to subtypes B, C, D, G, and H as well as CRF01_AE and CRF02_AG harbour Leucine ( http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/ ). In fact, the TW10 consensus sequence in subtypes D and A1 differ only at this residue: 240TSTLQEQIGW 249 in D compared to 240TSTPQEQIGW 249 in A1. Gag T242N can however occur in subty pe A1 under some circumstances. We observed 8 instances of this mutation in s ubtype A1-infected individuals, 7 of whom expressed B*57:02 or B*58:01, alleles that belong to the same HLA supertype as B*57:03. In subtype A1 however , T242N never occurred in conjunction with the subtype 74 consensus Proline at position 243; rather , the adjacent residue was the HIV group M consensus L243 (3/8), V243 (2/8), T243 (1/8), I243 (1/8) or a mixture of the latter two (1/8). We therefore hypothesized that consensus P243 prevents the selection of T242N in subtype A1 41. In silico structural models of Gag codons 232- 254 in subtypes A1 and D, which encompass helix 6 of p24Gag and the region immediately upstream, supported this hypothesis ( Figure 2-5A ). Atomic distances between alig ned structures were expressed in terms of root mean square deviation (RMSD)54, where values greater than 2.5-3\u00c5 in silico indicate substantial structural differences55-57. The subtype A1 consensus Proline at Gag 243 already notably alters the peptide structure compared to subtype D. Furthermore, whereas T242N is predicted to only minimally impact helix 6 structure in subtype D (RMSD between predict ed structures of 0.77\u00c5), T242N in subtype A1 is predicted to prevent helix 6 formation and to disrupt upstream protein folding (RMSD between predicted structures of 4.3\u00c5). To confirm mutational antagonism between T242N and P243 we engineered the former into a recombinant virus that har boured a participant-derived subtype A1 Gag- D Gag- Protease sequence, in an HIV NL4.3 reference strain backbone and generated virus stocks pseudotyped with the Vesicular stomatitis virus-G (VSVg) reporter CD4+ T-cell line and measuring the %GFP-expressing ( i.e. infected) cells 48 hours later. All viral stocks were confirmed to be infectious, though titers of the T242N-containing subtype A1 mutant were lower than the others ( Figure 2-5B ). We then assessed the ability of these viruses to replicate in the same GFP-reporter T-cell line 59. Cells were infected with a standard viral inoculum (multiplicity of infection 0.003) and viral spread was monitored by flow cytometry over up to 8 days post-infection. Dramatic differences in the impact of T242N on viral replication were observed between the two subtypes ( Figure 2-5C ). Consistent with previous observations in subtypes B and C19, 60, which also harbour Leucine at codon 243, T242N conferred a modest impact on viral replication capacity in subtype D (0.96 relative to parental, p=0.1) but completely abrogated vira l replication in subtype A1 (p=0.004). Complete abrogation of T242N-containing subtyp e A1 viral replication continued to be observed even when cultures were infected at multiplicities of infection of up to 0.05 (data not shown). Viral replication was similarly abolished when T242N was engineered 75 into a recombinant HIV NL4.3 strain harbouring consensus subtype Subtype-specific constraints drive differential B*57:03- mediated selection of Gag T242 N between subtypes A1 and D. panel A: in silico modeling of the effect of Gag T242N (re d, bottom models) on the structure of subtype D (green, left) and A1 (grey, right) consensus p24Gag codons 232- 254 (top models). Differences in the subtype D and A1 consensus sequence at codon 243 are highlighted (subtype 77 D Leucine, light green; s ubtype A1 Proline, light grey). While T242N is predicted to have minimal impact in subtype D (green, left, top vs botto m), its introduction into subtype A1 p24Gag is predicted to substantially alter pept ide structure (grey, right, top vs bottom) by disrupting helix formation ( ie codon 241, blue) and upstream folding. panel B: representative flow cytometry plots confirming infectivity (GFP) of VSVg-pseudotyped recombinant virus stocks, generated from participant-derived plasma HIV RNA sequences, in a CEM-derived LTR-driven GFP-reporter T- cell line, during experiments to determine viral titre.

Two independent experiments were performed. 78 Subtype-specific epitope presentation underlies some instances of differential escape: B*15:03- K105R While the above result confirms that subtype-specific mutational barriers underlie some instances of differential escape, ot her cases likely reflect a lack of immune pressure in a given subtype because the relevant CTL epitope is not efficiently presented by the restricting HLA in that viral genetic context. Nef K105R, which is selected by B*15:03 in subtype A1 D (intersubtype comparis on p=0.005, q=0.02) (Figure 2-4 ) represented a candidate for this la tter mechanism. Of note, K105R is reproducibly selected by another allele, HLA- C*07:01, in both subtypes, in fact more strongly in D than A1 ( Figure 2-4 ). This suggests that differ ential selection of K105R by B*15:03 is not due to subtype-specific fitne ss costs, but rather be cause B*15:03 exerts greater selective pressure on this region of Nef in subtype A1 compared to D due to higher affinity binding of a putative viral epitope to this allele in subtype A1. We first confirmed that K105R did not substantially impact Nef's three most well- characterized functions - cell-surface CD4, HLA class I and SERINC5 downregulation 61- in either subtype backbone ( As hypothesized, impact Nef-mediated CD4 downregulation capacity in subtype D (the mean function of K105R relative to subtype consensus was 0.99 [st andard A1 Nef function, where CD4 (mean 1.0 [0.009], p=0.75), SERINC5 (mean 1.0 [0.03], p=0.5) downregulation function not significantly different than consensus ( Figure 2-7B ). We then investigated whether differential B*15:03-mediated selection of Nef K105R is due to the presence of a B*15:03-re stricted epitope in subt ype A1 but not D. As no B*15:03 epitopes have been mapped in this region we used netMHC 4.0 65 to codons 104-112, where K105R at position 2. Consistent with our hypothesis, the subtype A1 consensus sequence (RL9; 104RKRQEILDL 112) was predicted to bind nearly seven-fold more strongly to B*15:03 (predicted binding affinity: 131.2nM) than the Epitope binding to B*15:03 was experiment ally confirmed using a competitive binding assay where a titration of the epitope of interest competes with a fixed dose of a fluorescently-labeled reference peptide for B*15:03 binding on the surface of cells 66-68 (Figure 2-7E ). The reference peptide used was IY9 4 on the fluorophore was conjugated. The IY9 reference peptide, predic ted high for B*15:03 (3.3nM, Figure 2-7C ), selectively bound K562-derived cells engineered stably express across a 64-fold dilution range ( Figure 2-7D ). It also behaved as expected in competition experiments, where titration of unlabeled IY9 consistently reduced median fluorescence of target ce lls by up to 53% in a dose-dependent manner, while titration of the negative control HLA-A*02:01-specific FS8 epitope, which spans Gag codons 433-440 70 and has a predicted B*15:03 binding affinity of 40,487nM (Figure 2-7C ), did not reduce fluorescence at any concentration tested ( Figure 2-7E ). Having validated our assay to be B*15:03 and peptide-specific, we tested the predicted subtype A1 and D RL9/ QL9 epitopes for their abilit y to compete IY9 for B*15:03 binding ( Figure 2-7E ). While both RL9 and QL9 were able to compete with IY9 for binding to B*15:03 in a dose-dependent manner, subtype A1 RL9 consistently reduced median fluorescence relative to no competitor peptide to a greater extent than subtype D QL9 over all concentrations tested (mean 9% [standard deviation 2.7%] greater reduction in subtype A1 than subt ype D). These results are consistent with netMHC binding predictions ( Figure 2-7C ) for these epitopes and support the notion that the subtype A1 epitope sequence is more immunogenic. Therefore the absence of the B*15:03-restricted K105R polymorphism in the context of subtype D infection is likely attributable to reduced or absent B*15:03-mediated selective pressure on this region of Nef in vivo . 80 Figure 2-7 Subtype-specific mediated selection Nef K105R between subtypes A1 and D. panel A: representative flow cytomet ry plots depicting the ability of consensus and K105R Nef subtype D (top) and A1 (bottom) sequences to downregulate CD4, HLA Cla ss I and SERINC5 in a transfection-based assay (parental subtype cont rol (\"No Nef\") corresponds to empty pSelect-GFP vector.

Discussion This study represents the first system atic characterization of HLA-driven polymorphisms in major HIV group M subtypes A1 and D, and the first rigorous statistical investigation of the extent to which muta tional immune escape pathways differ across HIV subtypes in a cohort that was carefully selected to minimize confounding by host immunogenetic, sociodemographic and other factors. Overall our results indicate that, while many immune escape pathways are shared across HIV subtypes - 32% of HLA-associated polymorphisms identified in the present study had been previously described in at least one other HIV subtype - a subst antial proportion are not. In particular, our observation that 34% of HLA-associated polymorphisms are statistically significantly differentially selected between subtypes A1 and D identifies the viral genetic backbone as a key modulator of immune-driven HIV evolution. The HLA-associated polymorphisms presently identified generally corroborate previous observations in subtypes A1 and D 41, 42, though some differences are noted. Gag T242N had previously been observed among individuals expressing B58 supertype alleles in subtype D, but not A1, in a Kenyan cohort 41; our study, performed at subtype- level HLA resolution, further identifies B*57:03 is the specific allele responsible for these differential effects. However, the Kenyan study also identified other B58 supertype- associated escape mutations in Gag that were not observed presently, at least not at the 82 stringent q<0.2 cutoff: these in cluded P243T in the KF11 epitope in bot h subtypes A1 and D, and A162X in subtype A1 41. B*57-associated Gag I147L in the IW9 epitope, previously described in subtype D41, was also not observed presently. While confounding by regional differences in HLA frequencies cannot be ruled out, and issues relating to statistical power must be acknowledged, the observation that the Ugandan and Kenyan subtype A1 and D Gag consensus sequences differ at 10 and 7 codons respectively suggests that the influence of HIV genetic context on HLA-mediated adaptation may be even more nuanced, with differences possibly occurring at the sub-subty pe or regional levels. The observation that 13% of polymorphisms restricted by a given HLA allele (where the frequency of each allele was verified to be comparable between cohorts) in subtype B were differentially selected in Japan compared to Canada/USA/Australia also supports regional HIV strain variation as a determinant of immune escape pathways, though confounding by other host population factors, in particular T-ce ll repertoire genetics, cannot be ruled out 10. While our study supports a role of viral genetics in modulating immune-driven HIV evolution, our estimate that 34% of HLA-associated polymorphisms differ between viral subtypes is nevertheless lower than earlier estimates. In particular, a study comparing HLA-associated polymorphisms identif ied in subtype B-infected individuals in Canada and subtype C-infected individuals in S outh Africa estimated that HLA-mediated selection differed in 86% of shared epitopes, defined at the HLA allele level, between these HIV subtypes 11. This study however did not formally test for differential escape and was also likely confounded by differences in HLA subtype frequencies between cohorts ( e.g. B*57:01 versus B*57:03 being the most common B*57 allele in Canada and South Africa, respectively 39, 71). Our observations that 32% of identified polymorphisms represented canonical escape mutations descr ibed in other subtypes, and furthermore that 66% of identified HLA-associated polymorphisms did not significantly differ in strength of selection across subtypes A1 a nd D, underscores that, despite substantial differences, many immune escape pathways are nonetheless shared across HIV subtypes. We further confirm that distinct mechanisms, namely subtype-specific fitness costs of escape and differential epitope binding, explain specific instances of differential HLA-driven adaptation. This is important as the underlying mechanism has vaccine design implications. Gag TW10 for example is highly immunogenic in multiple HIV 83 subtypes14, 15, 41, 52 and escape via T242N confers modest in vitro yet likely substantial in vivo fitness costs in most viral subtypes as evidenced by its rapid and frequent reversion upon transmission to an HLA-mismatched host 15, 72. Here we demonstrate, through site- directed mutagenesis of one participant-derived and one consensus sequence, that the T242N-P243 combination completely abrogates viral replication in subtype A1. Though we cannot completely rule out the possib ility that compensator y mutational pathways could exist in some subtype A1 contexts, th e severity of this defect demonstrated here and the lack of observation of T242N-P243 in natural sequences in this and other 41, 42 studies renders this somewhat unlikely. We hypothesize that T242N reduces fitness by destabilizing HIV capsid structure in t he subtype A1 consensus viral backbone, a conclusion that is supported by our pepti de modeling experiments and our observation that T242N/P243-containing subtype A1 viruses display lower infectivity, even when VSVg-pseudotyped. While Gag T242N is reported to increase HIV capsid sensitivity to the cellular restriction factor TRIM5 73, and we cannot rule out the contribution of TRIM5 to our results, subtype A1 capsid is less sensitive to TRIM5 than that of other subtypes 73 and the CEM-derived T-cell line used in our viral spread assay expresses relatively high levels of cyclophilin A 74 that counteracts the effect of TRIM5 on capsid stability 75. Regardless of the specific mechanism underlying the fitness cost, these observations support inclusion of this epit ope in pan-subtype HIV vaccines and further identify it as a particularly useful immunogen in subtype A1. Other cases of differential adaptation identify epitopes t hat are likely to represent Nef K105R, is unlikely to be immunogenic in subtype D due to weaker binding of its cognate sequence to this allele. Further evaluation of RL9's immunogenicity in subtype A1 and others are merited, though K105R's lack of in vitro functional cost suggests a relatively low barrier to escape. Integrated bioinformatic and molecular approaches such as that described in the present study, combined with inform ation on epitope immunogenicity and HLA- mediated viremia control, could thus aid rational selection of CTL-based vaccine immunogens. The present study is not without lim itations. Our subtype A1 and D cohort subsets are smaller, and thus lower-powered, than those normally used to identify HLA- associated polymorphisms 9, 10, 12, 13, 45, and as such these immune escape maps should 84 not be considered comprehensive. Power limitations also precluded us from investigating certain associations more fu lly. Our observation that HLA-B*57:02 was significantly associated with Gag T242N in subtype A1 (p=1.9x10-6; q=0.006) ( Figure 2- 3 and Extended Data File S1 [not shown]) was particularly intriguing, however we could not assess whether this association is differentially selected between subtypes A1 and D because only two indivi duals expressed B*57:02 in t he latter group. Our ability to determine why Gag T242N is selected by B*57:02, but not the more common HLA-B*57:03, in subtype A1 is similarly limited, t hough it is worth noting that the absence of selection by the latter is not attributable to a lack of statistical power: whereas 4 of 6 subtype A1-infected individuals expressi ng B*57:02 harboured T242N, statistically significant association after phylogenetic correction, T242N was observed in only 1 of 15 B*57:03-expressing subtype A1-infected individuals, who also expressed B*57:02. Even more intriguingly, all 8 instanc es of T242N in subtype A1, of which 4 occurred in B*57:02-expressing individuals, never occurred with the subtype consensus Proline at the adjacent codon 243, suggesting that B*57:02 was pressuring HIV to escape via P243X in subtype A1. Indeed, B*57:02 carriage was negatively associated with Gag P243 in subtype A1 with a lnOR= - , p=0.007, but this association did not survive our stringent multiple comparisons co rrection and thus is not featured on our immune escape map. Nevertheless, this suggests that differences in TW10 epitope presentation between B*57:02 and B*57:03 in subtype A1 may alter immune selection pressures on this epitope. This notion is supported by descriptions of B*57-mediated selection of P243T in subtype A1 41, as well as the fact that B*57:03 and B*57:02 differ by a single residue in their peptide-binding groove that likely interacts with this region of TW10 76. Indeed, selection of distinct escape mutations by highly closely-related HLA alleles presenting the same viral epitope have previously been described77-79. The well-matched clinical profiles of our cohort subsets are also worth mentioning given the accumulating evidence that HIV subtype D i associated with more rapid progression than subtype A130-34. We did not deliberately select cohort subsets to have comparable clinical profiles. Rather, this likely reflects the fact that we studied the baseline (pre-therapy) cross-section of two HIV treatment cohorts (see methods) - and treatment eligibility is guided in part by immunological (CD4+ T-cell count) criteria. Though it is possible that cohort subsets di ffer in terms of infection duration (this information is not known for study partici pants), the majority of HLA-driven escape and 85 reversion events occur well before CD4+ T-cell counts reach the levels observed in the present study51. In fact, HLA-associated polymorphisms in other HIV subtypes have been determined using the baseline (treatment -naive) cross-section of HIV treatment cohort(s) with CD4 and pVL profiles comparable to the present cohort 7-10, 12, 13, 45, 80. The value of integrated bioinformatic and molecular studies such as the present one is worth stating directly. While techniques such as IFN- ELISpot can identify HIV epitopes recognized in vitro in one or more viral subtypes, these may not necessarily be relevant in vivo . In contrast, HLA-associated polymorphisms identified at the population level identify specific HIV regions under st rong and reproducible selection (that is, immunogenic viral regions) in vivo . Integrated bioinformatic and molecular studies thus offer a complementary approach to rational immunogen selection that begins with an in vivo relevant observation ( i.e. the identification of viral sites under differential HLA- mediated selective pressure) and subsequently proceeds to mechanistic characterization to inform immunogen selection. While only two examples of differential escape were investigated in the present st udy, in many cases a putative mechanism could be proposed for future validation. For example, epitope binding predictions and subtype-specific sequence conservation data s uggest that the lack of selection of both RT 514D and RT 179I by HLA-B*49:01 in s ubtype D may be attributable to subtype- specific fitness costs, while the lack of B*42:01-mediated selection of Nef 20M in subtype A1 is likely attributable to suboptimal epitope binding. In conclusion, our study represents the first characterization of HLA-driven adaptation pathways in HIV subtypes A1 and D and the first statistically rigorous characterization of differential HLA-driven escape across viral subtypes. Results support a considerable impact of the viral genetic context on HIV adaptation to host HLA, where differences are attributable to subtype-specific sequence variations that influence epitope-HLA binding or determine the mutational barrier to immune escape. A framework to identify viral regions that differ in terms of epitope binding and the functional costs of immune escape across HIV subtypes could aid in vaccine design: the present study highlights the power of combined bioinformatic and mechanistic studies, paired with knowledge of epitope immunogenicity, towards this goal. 86 2.7. Methods 2.7.1. Participants and ethics statement Participants comprised a subset of the 513 individuals originally recruited to two established Ugandan HIV treatment cohorts, the Adherence Monitoring Uganda (AMU) cohort and the Uganda AIDS Rural Treat ment Outcomes (UARTO) cohort 46-48. All participants were antiretroviral naive at baseline (cohort entry), which is when HIV genotyping was performed for the present analysis. While duration of infection is unknown, CD4 count and viral load distributions indicate that majority of participants are likely to be in chronic infection ( Table 2-1 ), which is appropriate for identifying HLA- associated polymorphisms statistically, as by this stage a majority of HLA-driven escape (and reversion) will have occurred, thereby incr easing statistical power to identify such associations 51. All participants were enroll ed under REB-approved protocols and provided written informed consent. Ethics approval to conduct this study was obtained from the Institutional Review Boards of Providence Health Care/University of British Columbia, Simon Fraser University and the Mbarara University of Science and Technology. 2.7.2. Host and viral genotyping Total nucleic acids were extracted from 500 \u00b5l blood plasma using standard methods. HIV gag, protease- reverse transcriptase (amplified together), integrase , and (SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum Taq High Fidelity DNA Polymerase, Invitrogen) followed by a nested round of PCR (Expand HiFi Syst em, Roche) using gene-specific primers optimized for pan-HIV group M binding. Amplicons were bulk (directly) sequenced using a 3730xl or 3130xl automated DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Chromatograms were analyzed using Sequencher version 5.0.1 (Gene Codes) or RECall 81 with nucleotide mixtures called if the height of the secondary peak exceeded 25% of the height of the dominant peak (Sequencher) or 20% of the dominant peak area (RECall). Analysis was restricted to gag, protease-RT , integrase and nef sequences identified as \"pure\" subtypes A1 or D, determined by first screening sequences with the Recombinant Identification Program (RIP) 3.0 at a window size of 100 (https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/RIP/RIP.html ) and then inferring and visualizing 87 gene-specific maximum-likelihood phylogenies as follows. (options: class I typing was performed using sequence-based methods86. Inter-cohort differences in HLA allele frequency were assessed using the Los Alamos HIV Immunology Database's HLA Comparison tool (http://www.hiv. lanl.gov/content/immunology/hl a/hla_compare.html). Multiple comparisons were addressed using q-values, the p-value analogue of the false discovery rate (FDR). The FDR is the expected proportion of false positives among results deemed significant at a given p-value threshold (e.g. at a q \u0001 0.2, we expect 20% of identified associations to be false positives). 2.7.3. GenBank accession numbers Subtype A1 and D HIV gag, integrase and nef sequences have been deposited into for a subset of participants we re previously submitted as part of 87 and have been updated to include the entire protease and reverse transcriptase deposited under the accession numbers MH925335- MH925337. 2.7.4. Identification of HLA-associated polymorphisms Established phylogenetically-corrected stat istical methods were used to identify HLA-associated polymorphisms in subtypes A1 and D separately 9, 49. To preserve universal HIV codon numbering conventions, the HIV subtype B reference strain HXB2 sequence was added to each HIV dataset, aligned as above, and all columns where HXB2 was gapped were stripped out. Evidence for selection by HLA class I and/or co-varying amino acids in HIV Gag, Protease- RT, Integrase and Nef was assessed using a weighted logistic regression approach. In this model, the amino acid is assumed to evolve independently down the tree until it reaches the tips, which represent the studied HIV sequences. On each tree tip, selection pre ssure arising from HLA alleles expressed by the participant is directly modeled using a stochastic additive pr ocess that treats each HLA allele as a binary variable ( i.e. presence/absence of the allele in question). Covarying HIV amino acids are also included as model variables. To identify the factors 89 that contribute to the obser ved HIV sequence at the tree tips, a forward selection approach is employed, in which the most significant HLA-HIV amino acid (or HIV amino acid-HIV amino acid) association is iteratively added. Here, the null hypothesis that the observed HIV amino acid at the tree tips can be explained by neutral evolution along the phylogeny is tested against the alternative hypothesis that its presence is better explained by the presence of an HLA class I allele(s) and/or co-varying HIV amino acid(s). P-values are computed using the likelihood ratio test and q<0.2 was used to define statistical significance, as in previous studies 7-9, 12, 13, 45. HLA-associated polymorphisms were grouped into two categories: adapted (inferred escaped) forms, which represent HIV amino acids significantly overrepresented in the presence of the HLA allele and nonadapted (inferred susceptible) forms, which represent HIV amino acids significantly underrepresented in the presence of th e allele in question. A novel modification to an existing weighted logistic regression approach was used to identify instances of differential selection of HLA-associated polymorphisms across HIV subtypes 9, 10, 49, 51. This test was applied to all polymorphisms identified in subtype A1 and/or D where at least three individuals in both cohorts harboured the restricting HLA allele. Briefly, the null model treats each HIV polymorphism as the outcome variable and the single restricting HLA allele as the predictor. This model is then compared to a more expressive one that includes an interaction term for subtype using a likelihood ratio test. To increase the stringency of the test, polymorphisms differentially selected at the more conser vative threshold of p<0.05, were conformational modeling In silico predicted peptide structures were using PEP-FOLD (version 2.0) 88-90 and visualized using PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (version 2.0.7, Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC). Root mean square deviation (RMSD), calculated as the square root of the mean of the square of the distances between the matched atoms, was determined between structures using the Visual Molecular Dynamics program (version 1.9.4) 54 to assess similarity of structures. 90 2.7.6. Recombinant virus generation and replicative assessment The Gag T242N mutation was engineered into one arbitrarily selected subtype A1 and one subtype D participant-derived Gag-Protease sequence using overlap- extension PCR, where resulting amplicons were designed to have an approximately 20 base pair overlap with a pNL4.3 (subtype B) reference strain plasmid lacking Gag- Protease described in 91. T242N mutant HIV subtype A1 Gag-Protease sequences were synthesized as three roughly equal-sized gBlocks (Integrated DNA Technologies) wi th approximately 20 base pair overlap between fragments as well as with the Gag-Protease pNL4.3 refer ence strain plasmid. Inserts were fused pNL4.3 using Gibson Enzymatic Assembly ( 92, NEBuilder, New England BioLabs) at a 3:1 insert:backbone molar ratio. The entire HIV coding region of the resulting recombinant plasmids was sequenced to confirm carriage of only the mutations of interest. Viral stocks pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSVg) envelope 58 were obtained by co-transfecting 13 \u00b5g of recombinant plasmid into 2.8 million HEK 293T cells along with 1.3 \u00b5g of (Lipofectamine LTX, ThermoFisher Scientific). VSVg pseudotyping was done in order to ensure that all recombinant viruses were capable of at least a first round of infection. Culture supernatants containing recombinant virions were harvested at 48 hours post-transfection and frozen prior to use. Recombinant viral stocks were titered by infecting a CEM-derived reporter CD4+ T-cell line har bouring an HIV Long Terminal Repeat (LTR)- driven Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) ex pression cell viral inocula and measuring the %GFP-expressing ( i.e. infected) cells 48 hours post-infection (Day 2). The volume of viral stock required to achieve 0.3% GFP+ cells on Day 2 was then determined by linear extrapolation. Viral replication was assessed using a published multi-cycle reporter assay 59. Briefly, the CEM-GXR GFP-reporter T-cell line was infected at a MOI of 0.003 - that is, to achieve 0.3% GFP-positive ( i.e. infected) cells on day 2. To quantify subsequent viral spread, the percentage of infe cted cells was measured via flow cytometry (Guava 8HT, Millipore) daily for up to 8 days thereafter. R eplication capacity was then calculated as the natural log of the slope of viral spread during the exponential phase. Replication capacities of viruses harbouring T242N were compared to their subtype parental or consensus control. Replication of each participant-derived recombinant virus was 91 assessed in a minimum of three independent experiments; consensus-derived recombinant viruses were assessed in duplicate. 2.7.7. Nef-mediated HLA and SERINC5 downregulation K105R was A1 or D consensus Nef (HIV LANL) gBlocks (Integrated DNA Technologies) via overlap-exte nsion Amplicons were cloned into pSELECT-GFPzeo, which contains dual promot ers driving the expression of GFP as well as the gene of interest, and sequence-conf irmed. The ability of each Nef clone to downregulate cell-surface CD4 and HLA class I was determined as previously described 94. Briefly, a CEM CD4+ T-cell line engineered to express high levels of HLA-A*02 (CEM- A*02) was transfected with consensus or mut ant Nef clones by electroporation. Cells were stained 20-24 hours post-transfecti on with Median Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) or HLA downregulation function of each Nef mutant was normalized to that of its subtype consensus control using the following equation: (MFI negative control - MFI mutant)/(MFI negative control - MFI subtype consensus ). The function of each mutant and consensus Nef sequence was assessed in a minimum of three independent experiments. To assess SERINC5 downregulation function, CEM-A*02 cells were co- transfected with 1 of Nef plasmid and 5 \u00b5g of a plasmid expressing an internally HA- tagged SERINC5 by electroporation 95. Cells were stained 20-22 hours post-transfection anti-HA antibody (Biolegend). The SERINC5 downregulation function of each mutant was normalized to that of its corresponding subtype consensus control using the same equation as above. The function of each Nef mutant and consensus sequence was assessed in a minimum of three independent experiments. 92 2.7.8. Epitope Competitive Binding Assay Subtype-specific epitope binding to using a competition-based cellular binding assay 66-68. Candidate subtype A1 and D epitopes spanning Nef residue 105 that displayed the highest affinity for HLA-B*15:03 were identified using netMHC 4.0 software 65. To 69) sequence was modified to contain a Cysteine at position 4 to yield IQQ on (pH cells 96 K562-derived cells retrovirally transduced to stably express HLA- B*15:03 to confirm HLA specificity and to determine the optimal concentration of the reference peptide for use in competitive binding assays. In the competitive binding assay, a fixed concentration of fluorescently-labeled IY9 was mixed with a titration of the candidate or control epitope cells at 4\u00b0C for 24 hours in the dark. Median fluorescence intensity was then determined by flow cytometry (Guava 8HT, Millipore) and analyzed us ing FlowJo (version 9.9.5). Three independent experiments were performed. 2.8.

Yanqin Ren, Winiffer Conce Alberto, Szu Han Huang and QVOA data for non-Vancouver-based ( Figures 3-1C, Other co-authors Proviral DNA Assay (IPDA) was developed to address the critical need for a scalable method for intact HIV-1 reserv oir quantification. This droplet digital PCR- based assay simultaneously targets two HIV-1 regions to distinguish genomically intact proviruses against a large background of defective ones, and its application has yielded insights into HIV-1 persistence. Reports of assay failures however, attributed to HIV-1 polymorphism, have recently emerged. Here, we describe a diverse North American cohort of people with HIV-1 subtype B, where the IPDA yielded a failure rate of 28% due to viral polymorphism. We further demonstrate that within-host HIV-1 diversity can lead the IPDA to underestimate intact reservoir size, and provide examples of how this phenomenon could lead to erroneous interpretation of clinical trial data. While the IPDA represents a major methodological advance, HI V-1 diversity should be addressed before its widespread adoption as a principal readout in HIV-1 remission trials. 3.3. Introduction The Intact Proviral DNA Assay (IPDA) was developed to address the critical need for a precise and scalable method to quantify in tact HIV-1 proviruses, which represent the main barrier to achieving HIV-1 remission or cure1. This duplexed droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay simultaneously targets two HIV-1 regions, the Packaging Signal ( ) near the 5' end of the viral genome and the Rev Responsive Element (RRE) within Envelope (env), to distinguish genomically intact proviruses against a large background of defective ones. The IPDA requires less time, resources and biological material than the current gold standard for replication-com petent HIV-1 reservoir measurement, the Quantitative Viral Outgrowth Assay (QVOA) 2, while also quantifying the total proviral burden. Application of the assay to increasing numbers of individuals living with HIV-1 has yielded insights into reservoir composition and dynamics 3-6, and the assay is being recommended for use in clinical trials evaluating HIV-1 remission strategies4, 5, 7. 104Recently however, instances of assay failure, attributable to natural HIV-1 polymorphism in primer and/or prob e binding regions, have been described5-7. While detection failures are expected for any molecular assay targeting a genetically variable pathogen, this rate has varied markedly across studies, ranging from 0% in the initial two reports (0/62 1 and 0/814) to 12% (6/50) in the most recent publication7, where the assay was performed by the same group. A recent multi-cohort study comprising 400 individuals reports an overall 6.3% failure rate 5; however because this study includes the above4 and other published cohorts with 0% failure rates8-10 it can be inferred that the rates for the unpublished datasets are higher. Thus, while the IPDA is undeniably a major methodological advance, further study is needed to delineate the impact of HIV-1 sequence diversity. This is particularly relevant to clinical trials, which would either require an accurate anticipated rate of failure for power calculations, or strategies to address diversity directly, which might include pre-enrolment screening to determine IPDA-detectability of an indi vidual's virus and/or developm ent of secondary primers and probes. Here, we aimed to further develop the IPDA by assessing its performance within a diverse cohort of individuals with HIV-1 subtype B from across North America. Our study is unique in a number of ways. First, with the exception of one study that investigated a subset (20%) of assay failures by HIV-1 sequencing 5, no studies to date have combined IPDA, QVOA and HIV sequencing to examine the frequency and potential implications of assay failures in detail. We describe an IPDA failure rate of 28% in our cohort, where we used QVOA to conf irm that intact proviruses were indeed present in these cases, and where we present the underlying sequence polymorphisms for each case of failure. Second, we illustrate how wi thin-host HIV divers ity - specifically, cases where an individual harbours viral variants that are detectable and others that are undetectable by the assay - could lead the IPDA to underestimate intact HIV-1 reservoir size. We further provide examples of how this type of error could negatively impact clinical trial results interpretation. Third, our study provides an assessment of the IPDA by a group other than its original developers (or the associated company Accelevir Diagnostics). This could benefit the field, given that a major advantage of the IPDA is its potential for broad accessibility. Our failure rate of 28% occu rred in the context of our efforts to precisely match the reported experimental conditions, with one exception. Whereas Peluso et al 4 indicate that gates to define pos itive droplets can be drawn tightly 105against double-negative droplets as defined in samples from individuals without HIV-1, we demonstrate that fluorescence signal from -positive templates (labeled with FAM) can bleed into the env channel, creating a false double-positive population, if gated in this manner. This represents a previously unr eported source of error in the IPDA. Taken together, we present an independent assessment of the scope of the challenge of addressing HIV-1 diversity in the IPDA , and - through sequence characterization - contribute to understandi ng the catalogue of polymorphisms that will need to be addressed with secondary primers and probes, towards improved iterations of this valuable assay. 3.4. Results 3.4.1. IPDA measurements in a diverse North American cohort We applied the IPDA to 46 individuals with HIV-1 subtype B who had achieved viral suppression from cohorts across Canada, the USA and Mexico. Initial assay results yielded a median of 29 (interquartile range [IQR] 0-93) intact proviruses/million CD4+ T- cells ( Figure A-1 ), however among these were 17 participants (37%) for whom the IPDA did not detect any intact (i.e. and env double-positive) proviruses. In four of these individuals, both - and env- single-positive proviruses were detected, suggesting a true negative result (see example in Figure 3-1A and Figure A-2 ). In the remaining 13 individuals however, the IPDA did not detect - and/or env- single-positive proviruses above background levels and instead yielded assay failure5, 7 (Figure 3-1A , Figure A2 in eight of these participants only -positive proviruses were detected, in four only env-positive proviruses were detected, and in one participant no proviruses were detected. Fu rthermore, replication competent HIV-1 was recovered in 11/11 (100%) cases where sufficient biological material was available to perform QVOA, consistent with the failure of IP DA to detect autologous intact proviruses. 3.4.2. HIV sequence polymorphism can cause IPDA detection failure We next investigated the presumed cases of IPDA failure using HIV-1 sequencing. IPDA env probe, where in silico -predicted reservoir distributions that took these polymorphisms into account 106(Figure 3-1B, left ) differed markedly from the original experimentally-obtained result (Figure 3-1B, center ). Substituting an autologous env probe rescued detection in silico -predicted levels Figure 3-1B, right ), confirming that V-1 polymorphism can cause the IPDA to fail. Mismatches in the pr obe and/or at the 3' end of a primer were confirmed in all 13 cases of presumed assay detection failure ( Figure 3-1C ). Together, this yielded an overall failure rate of 13/46 (28%). Indeed, exclusion of these 13 data points markedly improved the correlation between IPDA and QVOA results among those for whom sufficient biological material was available to perform the latter assay, from =0.03, p=0.83 to =0.35, p=0.07 ( Figure 3-1D ), bringing this correlation more in line with that reported by the original authors 1 and what is expected biologically. By contrast, the correlation between QVOA and total HIV-1 gag DNA, measured using different HIV-1 primers and probe located in a conserved region11, was significant without exclusion of these data points ( Figure 3-1E ). 107 Figure 3-1 Inter-individual HIV diversity can lead to detection failure by the IPDA. panel A: IPDA 2D ddPCR plots.

HIV gag copies report the point estimate from at least 4 merged technical replicates for each sample. 3.4.3. Within-host HIV diversity can cause reservoir underestimation Though laborious to correct, complete detection failures due to HIV-1 polymorphism are nevertheless easy to flag due to their characteristic ddPCR plot presentation ( Figure 3-1A, Figure A-2 ). In contrast, within-host HIV-1 diversity in IPDA primer or probe regions (see Figure 3-1B for an example of diversity within a probe region) could lead the IPDA to underestimate intact reservoir size if the within-host variants were differentially detectable by the assay. Such partial detection failures would not be easy to identify. Moreover, if IPDA-detectable and non-detectable reservoir subpopulations were differentially susceptible to HIV-1 cure interventions, this could lead to erroneous conclusions regarding intervention efficacy. Though such a scenario remains hypotheti cal, we nevertheless illustrate our point using HIV-1-specific broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) as an example. bNAbs can facilitate elimination of HIV-1-infected cells 12 in part by targeting them for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)12, 13. As such, they are being evaluated in clinical trials, some of which use the IPDA as a readout (e.g: ACTG A538614). Participant 91C33 from a published trial15 provides a hypothetical example. This individual did not respond to (off-ART) infusions of the bNAbs 3BNC117 and 10-1074 because they harboured a plasma HIV-1 s ubpopulation that was resistant to both bNAbs 15 (Figure 3-2A ). Of note, this plasma HIV- subpopulation also harboured a 109mismatch to the IPDA env probe that we predicted would cause signal failure. We experimentally confirmed that, using the published conditions, the IPDA could not detect templates harbouring this polymorphism ( Figure 3-2B ), though signal could be detected if the annealing/extension temper ature was lowered to 53\u00b0C to account for the mismatch (Figure A-3 ). In contrast, templates representing the bNAb-sensitive strains could be detected readily using the published conditions ( Figure 3-2B ). Theoretically, if a person harbouring such diversity in their reservoir were to be successfully treated with one or both bNAbs in a trial that used the IPDA as t he sole readout, the intervention's effect on reducing the reservoir would be overestima ted because the assay was only capable of detecting the susceptible reservoir fraction ( Figure 3-2E, left ). ART-suppressed participant OM5346 provi example. Pre-ART HIV-1 resistance genotyping identified subtype B infection, however single-genome sequencing of pre-ART plasma and proviruses sampled during long-term ART revealed co-infection with a non-B strain ( Figure A-4 ). While the IPDA is only designed for subtype B, the co-infecting strain harboured no critical mismatches within IPDA target regions except for a G-to-A mismat ch at position 13 (G13A) of the env probe. Importantly, G13A is the most frequent env probe polymorphism [~5%] in subtype B (and was observed in 2/10 study participants for whom env was sequenced), and the original report indicated that the IPDA was capable of detecting this variant, at least when present on a plasmid template 1. As such, the assay should be able to detect this strain despite its non-B status. Using QV OA, we successfully isolated replication- competent subtype B (virus 3) and co-infecting (virus 4) strains from OM5346's reservoir, confirming both of these as true intended targets of the IPDA ( Figure 3-2C ). We further observed that these viruses were differentially susceptible to 3BNC117- and 10-1074-mediated ADCC: while virus 3-infected cells could be eliminated by but not 3BNC117-, mediated ADCC (25% and 0% relati ve reduction, respectively), the opposite was true for virus 4 (0% and 32% relative reduction, respectively) ( Figure 3-2C, Figure A-5). We further confirmed that, while the IPDA could readily detect provirus 3 at concentrations approximating biological samples, the assay could not distinguish provirus 4 at these concentrations ( Figure 3-2D, Figure A-6A ). Similarly, at biological concentrations, the IPDA could not detect a sy nthetic DNA template encoding the virus 4 sequence, though noticeable signal elevation occurred at ~100-fold higher template concentrations ( Figure A-6B ). Importantly, a secondary env primer/probe set (see below 110and methods) readily detected both viruses at all concentrations, regardless of template type ( Figure A-6 ). In the hypothetical case where this individual were to be successfully treated with a bNAb in a trial that used IPDA as a sole readout, different erroneous interpretations could occur depending on the intervention used. Specifically, if this individual were to be successfully treated with 10-1074, the IPDA would overestimate the intervention's effect on the reservoir because the assay was only capable of detecting the susceptible reservoir fraction. In contrast, if the individual were to be successfully treated with 3BNC117, the IPDA would erroneously conclude that the intervention had no effect because the assay was only capable of detecting the resistant reservoir fraction ( Figure 3-2E, panel A: 91C33 identified accession number s. 91C33 harbored one HIV subpopulation that matched the IPDA env probe and was sensitive to bNAbs 3BNC117 and 10-1074, and another that harbored a mismatch at position 4 of the IPDA env probe and was resistant to both bNAbs.

The solid line indicates the observed effect by IPDA; dashed line indicates the true effect. An intervention's impact on the reservoir could be overestimated when a subset of within-hos t HIV sequences are undetectable by IPDA and resistant to treatment (e.g . 91C33 during treatment wi th 3BNC117 or 10-1074, or OM5346 during treatment with 10- 1074). Conversely, an intervention's impact on the reservoir could be underestimated when a subset of within -host HIV sequences are undetectable by IPDA and sensitive to treatment (e.g. OM5346 during treatment with 3BNC117). In a worst-case scenario, one could erroneously conclude that the treatment had no effect. 3.4.4. Optical bleed-through as a source of error in the IPDA Though HIV-1 polymorphism can clearly cause the IPDA to fail in some instances, certain mismatches can be tolerated4, 5. This is due to the assay's use of endpoint (rather than real-time) PCR detection, such that polymorphisms that reduce signal can yield lower-amp litude droplets that can never theless still be scored as positive, provided that they are sufficiently separated from the negative population. In fact, participant OM5346's two viral populations illustrate this phenomenon: virus 3, which harbours a single nucleotide deletion as well as a mismatch in the probe, produces modest yet clearly discernible signal in the channel, whereas virus 4, which also harbours minor primer/probe mi smatches, produces higher-amplitude signal (Figure 3-3 ). Detailed investigation of such instances of HIV-1 sequence-driven amplitude modulations led us to identify another source of potential error, in the form of optical bleed-through, a challenge in multiplexed digital PCR assays 16. This occurs when fluorescence from the channel, which features the FAM fluorophore, bleeds into the env channel, which features the VIC fluorophore, to varying extents. This in turn has implications for the appropriate placement of thresholds defining negative and positive 113populations. Critically, because the extent of bleed-through is determined by the amplitude of the signal, which is in turn determined by the extent of match to the assay probe, the extent of fluorescence spillover is HIV-1 sequence-specific. We demonstrate this by applying the IPDA to synthetic templates encoding the regions of OM5346 viruses 3 and 4, without a corresponding env template present ( Figure 3-3 ). Virus 3's signal, which is modest, does not bleed into the env channel. By contrast, virus 4's high amplitude signal bleeds noticeably into the env channel. Thus, whereas a tight threshold based on the negative population can be drawn for virus 3, doing so for virus 4 creates env signal (and in fact intact provirus signal) even when no env template is present. This channel bleed-through for virus 4 thus likely contributed to the small amount of env signal in Figure 3-2D (events adjoining the negative population). While ddPCR instruments are factory-tuned to mitigate spectral overlap, this basic property of fluorophores underscores the instrument manufacturer's instruction that appropriate thresholds can only be drawn if negative and positive populations clearly separate from one another 17. Similarly, it cautions against the setting of gates solely based on data from uninfected donors, as suggested by Peluso et al4 as a strategy for suboptimal amplifications. 114 Figure 3-3 HIV sequence-specific optical bleed-through prohibits on negative panel A: 2D and env 1D plots of OM5346 virus 3 region sequence when tested as a synthetic DNA gene fragment (Virus 3 gBlock) without corresponding env template. Minimal - to env- channel spillover occurs and the positive droplet threshold can be drawn tightly to the double negative population wi thout consequence (note the presenc e of panel B: 2D and env 1D plots of OM5346 4 gBlock), without corresponding env template. Drawing a tight threshold causes optical bleed through of (FAM) fluorescence into the env (VIC) channel to yield a false-positive env (and by extension, false-positive intact) signal. panel C: 2D and env 1D plots of OM5346 Virus 4 region sequence, tested as a syn thetic DNA gene fragment (Virus 4 gBlock) without corresponding env template, with a threshold drawn at an appropriate distance from the double negative population. This threshold accommodates the fluorescence shift and thus avoids the creati on of false-positive intact or env-positive droplet population (note the presence of a single false-double positive dr oplet). Representative plots from one of 3 technical replicates from one experiment are shown. 3.4.5. Addressing inter-host HIV diversity in the IPDA The IPDA offers major scalability and accessibility advantages over existing molecular18 or culture-based approaches2, and a recent study that employed a quadruplexed qPCR assay confirmed that, of all probes evaluated, those used in the IPDA offered the greatest selectivity for intact proviruses 18. Unfortunately, the requirement to discriminate proviral defects in the region restricts the options for placement and sequence of these oligonucleotides19, and the limited data currently available for region polymorphisms in IPDA failure cases ( Figure 3-1C and 5) reveal few common polymorphisms that could be used to design secondary primer/probe sets. By contrast, placement of the 3' target is less constrained1. This allowed us to develop a secondary primer/probe set in the intact-d iscriminating RRE region, approximately 50 bases downstream of the original location, as a first step towards addressing HIV-1 diversity with a strategy other than autologous oligonucleotide design 3, 5 or data exclusion7. This primer/probe set rescued detection of env-positive proviruses in IPDA env detection failure ( Figure 3-4A ). When applied to the 36 participants for whom the IPDA detected env-positive proviruses (excluding OM5346 who harboured within-host failed to detect env-positive proviruses in 3 (8%) individuals, indicating that it is not a universal solution. For the remaining 33 (92%) however it yielded measurements that correlated strongly with those from the IPDA (Figure 3-4B ). The secondary primer/probe set co uld therefore be used to confirm instances of detection failure without confirmatory viral sequencing as well as to estimate intact provirus levels, though users must note that, unlike the IPDA env reaction, it cannot discriminate hypermutated sequences. 116 Figure 3-4 Performance of the secondary env primer/probe set. panel A: A secondary env primer/probe set rescued detect ion in all 9 cases of IPDA env detection failure (p= 0.004, B: env primer/probe set performs comparably to the IPDA in sa mples detectable by the latter assay. Black data points denote 33 participants whose reservoir was detectable by both IPDA and secondary env primer/probe sets; red data points denot e 3 participants whose reservoir was detectable by IPDA but not using the secondary env primer/probe set. Excluding the latter 3 points yielded a Spearman's =0.82, p<0.0001 (shown on figure) . Including these 3 red data points yielded a Spearman's =0.68, p<0.0001. Data points show point estimate from 4 merged technical replicates for each participant sample. 3.5. Discussion The IPDA is undeniably a major advance in HIV-1 persistence research, but recent reports of variable and increasing fa ilure rates due to HIV-1 polymorphism are concerning. While the original and early fo llow-up studies acknowledged HIV-1 diversity as a potential limitation that would require custom primer/probe sets, neither study reported any failures due to viral polymor phism (out of 62 and 81 participants, respectively) 1, 4. More recent studies of 61 and 50 participants reported failure rates of 9.8% and 12% respectively6, 7. The largest study undertaken to date using the IPDA, a multi-cohort study published by the assay's dev elopers, reports an overall failure rate of 6.3% of 400 participants5, though it is important to note that this study includes a number of published cohorts including four with 0% failure rates4, 8-10. As such, the inferred failure rate for some of the unpublished datasets could be as high as 18%, a value that approaches the 28% rate reported in the present indicate that as the IPDA is applied to diverse cohorts, detection failures will occur, and not infrequently . The data also together suggest that failure rates may vary markedly by cohort, presumably due to local HIV-1 diversity in regions where HIV-1 subtype B circulates. Indeed, failure rates differed markedly between regions in our own study: whereas the failure rates in the Vancouver and Toronto cohorts were 2/15 (13%) and 3/19 (16%) respectively, those in the Washington, D.C. and Bronx, N.Y. cohorts were 4/7 (57%) and 3/4 (75%) respectively. Moreover, these failures were not attribut able to shared HIV-1 polymorphisms nor to epidemiologic linkage ( Figure 3-1C ), and all infections were HIV-1 subtype B. The first step towards mitigating this issue is to raise awareness: samples that yield no or env single-positive proviruses should be flagged as unreportable until has been addressed (e.g . using autologous primers/probes 1, 4). Nevertheless, elevated failure rates limit the assay's sca lability and utility: autologous probe design is time-consuming and costly, and exclusion of assay failures could bias study results if failure rates are substantial. Our findings therefore underscore the importance of better underst anding the frequency and nature of HIV-1 polymorphisms within IPDA target regions and their impact on intact proviral quantification. Analysis of HIV-1 subtype B sequences from unique individuals in the Los Alamos HIV database revealed that 23% of 9,360 env sequences harboured at least one env probe mismatch (which is similar to our env detection failure rate of 9/46 or 20%), while 50% of 1,489 sequences harboured at least one probe mismatch (which is substantially greater than our detection failure rate of 5/46 or 11%). This suggests that the env reaction may be more sensitive to polymorphism than the reaction, but larger studies linking proviral sequence to IPDA readouts are needed to confirm this. Similarly, due to a paucity of studies that pair detailed within-host sequence characterization with IPDA measurements, it is not currently possible to estimate the extent and impact of within-host HIV-1 diversity on intact reservoir quantification by the IPDA. Nevertheless, when taken together with Gaebler et al's 18 observation that 4 of 9 (44%) studied reservoirs were heterogeneous in an IPDA probe region, our combined observations suggest that the impact of within-host HIV-1 diversity on IPDA accuracy may be non-negligible. 118In conclusion, we provide an independent assessment of HIV-1 sequence diversity as a source of error in the IPDA by integrating IPDA, QVOA, and viral sequence data to characterize detection failures. We report a substantially higher rate of complete detection failures than previous studies, and additionally identify partial detection failures, attributable to within-host viral variation, as a source of error in the IPDA. The latter issue is particularly challenging given that it is essentially impossible to detect without HIV-1 sequencing, but given the reservoir's highly dynamic nature 20 and our identification of cases where within-host dive rsity is linked to HIV-1 cure intervention susceptibility, it should not be i gnored. Given the clear value of the IPDA , iterative efforts to refine this assay are a priority. In the meantime, we recommend that proviral sequencing, at minimum within the IPDA target regions, should be performed for participants of HIV-1 remission clinical trials in which the IPDA is employed, and secondary and/or autologous primers/probes used to mitigate HIV-1 diversity. 3.6. Methods 3.6.1. Participants and Ethics Statement We studied 46 individuals with HIV-1 subtype B who were recruited to cohorts in Toronto (N=19), Vancouver (N=15), New York City (N=4), Washington, D.C. (N=7), and Mexico City (N=1). For Vancouver participants, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by density gradient separation Fetal Bovine Serum+ 10% other sites provided a leukapheresis sample from which PBMCs were isolated and cryopreserved as above. All participants were on long-term, virally suppressive combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) at time of sampling, with the exception of one elite controller. Participants' duration of untreated HIV-1 infection ranged from 1 month to >10 years, though the exact duration was unknown for most participants. Ethical approval to conduct this study was obtained from the Institutional Review Boards of Simon Fraser University, Providence Health Care/University of Britis h Columbia, Weill Cornell Medicine, and the George Washington University. All particip ants provided written informed consent. 1193.6.2. Quantitative Viral Outgrowth Assay (QVOA) For participants for whom sufficient biological material was available, the Quantitative Viral Outgrowth Assay (QVOA) was performed2. CD4+ T-cells were isolated from PBMCs by negative selection and plated in serial dilution at either 4 or 6 concentrations (12 replicate wells/concentration, 24-well plates). CD4+ T-cells were stimulated with g/mL) and irradiated allogeneic HIV-1- negative PBMCs were added to further induce viral reactivation. MOLT-4/CCR5 cells were added at 24hrs post-stimulation as targets for viral infection. Culture and p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was run on day 14 to identify virus-positive wells. Infectious Units per Million CD4+ T-cells (IUPM) was determined using the Extreme Limiting Dilution Analysis (ELDA) software (version 1.0, http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda/) 21. Culture supernatants from virus-positive wells were frozen (-80\u00b0C) future use. 3.6.3. Intact Proviral DNA Assay (IPDA) Genomic DNA was isolated from a median 4.5 (interquartile range [IQR] 4-5) million CD4+ T-cells using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) with precautions to minimize DNA shearing. Intact HIV-1 copi es/million CD4+ T-cells were determined by the Intact Proviral DNA Assay (IPDA)1, where HIV-1 and human RPP30 reactions were conducted independently in parallel and copies were normalized to the quantity of input DNA. In each ddPCR reaction, a median 7.5ng (IQR DNA Probes ( dUTPs, (final concentration 250nM, ThermoFisher Scientific) and designed by modifying the published IPDA env probe to match the participant's sequence (VIC-CCTTGGGTTTCTGGGA- MGBNFQ). Droplets were prepared using either the Automated or QX200 Droplet G enerator (BioRad) and cycled at 95\u00b0C for minutes; 45 cycles of (94\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 59\u00b0C for 1 minute) and 98\u00b0C for 10 minutes 1. Droplets were analyzed on a QX200 Droplet Reader (BioRad) using QuantaSoft software (Bio Rad, version 1.7.4), where replic ate wells were merged prior to analysis. Four technical replicates were performed for each participant sample, where a median (IQR) 243,100 (106,200- 265, 950) cells were assayed in total. Intact HIV-1 copies ( and env double-positive droplets) were corrected for DNA shearing based on the frequency of RPP30 and RPP30-Shear double positive droplets. The median (IQR) DNA shearing index (DSI), measuring the proportion of sheared DNA in a sample, was 0.31 (0.28- 0.35), highly comparable to that reported by the original authors 1. For the experiments that evaluated the IPDA's ability to detect the specific env sequences harboured gBlocks [IDT] for OM5346) we re used as Total HIV-1 gag copies/million CD4+ T-cells11 (Figure 3-1E ) were measured in reactions prepared using RPP30, as described above, and the following HIV-1-specific primers and probe (5'-> 3'): HIV-1 gag Forward - TCTCGACGCAGGACTCG; HIV-1 gag Reverse - TACTGACGCTCTCGCACC; HIV-1 gag Probe- FAM- CTCTCTCCT/ZEN/TCTAGCCTC- 3IABkFQ (IDT). Reactions were at: 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes; 40 cycles of (94\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 53\u00b0C for 1 minute) and 98\u00b0C for 10 minutes. A minimum of 4 (maximum 8) technical replicates were performed for each sample, where data from replicate wells was merged prior to analysis. 3.6.4. HIV-1 proviral amplification and sequencing Single-template, CD4+ T-cells by nested PCR using Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase High 121Fidelity (Invitrogen) such that ~25% of th e resulting PCR reactions yielded an amplicon. First round primers were: Forward - AAATCTCTAGCAGTGGCGCCCGAACAG, Reverse minutes; 10 cycles of (92\u00b0C for 10 seconds, 60\u00b0C for 30 seconds and 68\u00b0C for 10 minutes); 20 cycles of (92\u00b0C for 10 seconds, 55\u00b0C for 30 seconds and 68\u00b0C for 10 minutes); 68\u00b0C for 10 minutes 22, 23. Amplicons were sequenced using Illumina MiSeq technology and de novo assembled using the custom software MiCall (https://github.com/cfe-lab/MiCall) which f eatures an in-house mo dification of the Iterative Virus Assembler (IVA)24, or through collaboration with the Massachusetts General Hospital CCIB Core. 3.6.5. In silico predicted IPDA results Linked excised BC-004 of IPDA re sults under the assumpti on that intact probe regions would be detect ed by the assay. A or env probe region sequence was considered defective if it contained mutations associated with defective proviruses (e.g. those consistent with hypermutation 1 or common splice donor site mutations19) or if it was completely absent. All other probe region sequences, regardless of whether they matched the published IPDA probe sequence, were considered intact. 3.6.6. Targeted HIV-1 sequencing For participant OM5346, HIV-1 RNA was extracted from QVOA outgrowth viruses and pre-ART plasma, after which gp160 (QVOA) and gp120/Pol (plasma) were from endpoint-diluted templates by nested RT-PCR using HIV-1-specific primers and high fidelity enzymes. For participants with suspected IPDA detection failure, and for whom HIV-1 sequences were not already available, the IPDA and/or env amplicon regions were bulk-amplified from using specific primers. Amplicons were sequenced using Next Generat ion (Illumina MiSeq) technologies. Sanger chromatograms were analyzed using Sequencher (version 5.0.1, Gene Codes), while Illumina MiSeq reads were de novo assembled as described Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assays Total CD4+ T-cells were isolated, as described were then infected with the participant virus of interest collected from QVOA supernatant, and monitored by flow washed and incubated with the broadly neutralizing antibody of interest (either 3BNC117 or 10-1074, NIH 10g/mL) cells were selected (EasySep, StemCell Technologies) from PBMCs of allogeneic, HIV-1-negative donors and activated using interleukin-15 (IL-15) provided by the National Cancer Institute Biological Research Branch. Activated NK cells were then co-c ultured with the infe get (E:T) ratio of 1:1. Following co-culture, cells were stained with fluorophore-conjugat ed antibodies LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Stain amine-reactive dye (Inv itrogen). The percentages (%) of infected cells remaining post-ADCC relative to no antibody control were then determined using the following formula: (1- ((%Gag+ cells amongst viable CD3+ cells in no antibody condition)- (%Gag+ cells among viable CD3+ ce lls in test condition))/(%Gag+ cells amongst viable CD3+ cells under no antibody condition))*100. Two independent experiments were conducted, each with three technical replicates. Data were collected using Attune TM NxT software (ThermoFisher Scientific, version 2.7) and analyzed FlowJo (Becton Dickinson, version 10.6). 3.6.8. amplification and sequencing was performed from plasma (sampled in 2012), proviruses from purified CD4+ T-cells isolated during suppressive cART (sampled in 2017 and and replication- 123competent HIV-1 strains isol ated by QVOA (from the 2017 sample) as described above. The 2012 and 2017/2019 samples were shipped directly to, and amplified in, two separate laboratories. A plasma HIV-1 pol sequence derived from clinical drug resistance testing in 2012 was also incorporated into the analysis. pol and gp120 sequences were specifically amplified or retrieved from MAFFT (version 7.427)25 in and inspected in AliView (version 1.19)26. Maximum-likelihood phylogenies were inferred using PhyML (version 3.0)27 under a General Time Reversible nucleotide substitution model and visualized using FigTree (version 1.3.1). of primer/probe set HIV-1 Subtype B envelope sequences, limited to one per individual, were retrieved from the HIV LANL database (N=4,670, https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/components/sequence/HIV/search/search.html) and aligned. Sequence conservation was assessed across 16-25 base-pair intervals, and three intervals that maximized sequence conservation while meeting ddPCR assay specifications (i.e. amplicon length, T m) were chosen as secondary primer and probe locations. These were (5'->3'): Secondary env Forward Primer ACTATGGGCGCAGCGTC (representing nucleotides 7,809-7,825 in the HIV-1 genomic reference 7,921, 88% conservation). Reaction composition and cycling conditions were same as those used for the IPDA as described above. Accurate quantification using the Secondary env primer/probe set was verified using DNA extracted from the J-Lat 9.2 cell line (obtained from the NIH AIDS Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH, contributed by Dr. Eric Verdin) 28 (Figure A-7 ), where 3 independent experiments, each with 4 technical r eplicates, were performed and replicate wells were merged prior to data analysis. \u0001 1243.6.10.

Winnie Dong in part collected near-full length and subgenomic HIV sequence data. Don Kirkby, Daniel MacMillan and Charlotte Beelen developed the in-house de novo sequence assembly pipeline. Other co-authors provided technical assistance (T.M.M., H.S., Understanding proviral longevity is critical to HIV remission strategies, but previous phylogenetic studies that have inferred within-host proviral ages have not discriminated intact from defective viral genomes. We characterized the ages of intact and defective proviruses, ex vivo reactivated proviruses, along with plasma HIV sequences from post-ART rebound and on-ART low-level viremia events, in six participants who had received ART for a median 9.5 years. Methods: We used single-template-sequencing to longitudinally characterize evolving plasma HIV ( nef) populations over a median of 7 years pre-ART, along with near-full-genomes of HIV sequences persisting on ART. To mitigate uncertainty in within-host phylogenetic reconstruction, we inferred a median 1,500 phylogenies per participant from nef sequence alignments using Bayesian approaches. We calculated host-specific pre-ART HIV evolutionary rates from these trees, which were then used to convert root-to-tip distances of on-ART sequences to their integration dates. Results: We collected 885 pre-ART nef sequences 30% with intact dominated 5 of 6 participants' on-ART proviral landscapes, where we observed numerous examples of unique proviruses sharing exact deletion \"breakpoints\" both within and across participants. Clonal sequences, ranging from 17-55% within-host frequency, were enriched among intact and psi-defective proviruses, but not proviruses with large deletions or hypermutation. This suggests that clonal expansion is a less critical enabler of longevity for the latter proviruses, which instead possess an inherent persistence advantage through decreased like lihood of HIV expression. While all participants' on-ART proviral pools contained at least some sequences dating to earlier periods of untreated infection, all of the longest -lived proviruses were defective. All intact proviruses and sequences from ex vivo and in vivo viral rebound events dated to near ART initiation. Intriguingly, on-ART low-level viremia was phylogenies suggesti ng a potential defective proviral origin in some cases. Conclusion: Results strongly suggest that genomic integrity reduces proviral longevity. Nevertheless, further investigation of the anatomic/ cellular sources of low-level 130viremia is needed before firmly concluding that HIV remission strategies need only focus on eliminating the smaller subset of genetically younger proviruses. 4.3. Introduction Like all retroviruses, Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrates its genome into that of the host cell, usually a CD4+ T-lymphocyte1, 2, following infection. Most productively infected cells die or are eliminated by the immune system following infection 3, but a small minority persist even during long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART)4-7, and will fuel viral r ebound if treatment is interrupt ed. As a result, ART needs to be maintained for life. Achieving ART-free remission, or a complete cure of HIV infection, will require permanent inactivation or elimi nation of this persi stent HIV reservoir 8. Understanding its composition, genetic diversity and longevity is key to designing eradication strategies. Seeding of the persistent HI V reservoir begins virtually immediately following infection 9-11, and continues until ART initiation12-15. During untreated HIV infection however, archived proviruses \"turn over\" relatively rapidly: recent studies have estimated the average half-life of archived proviruses to be on the order of a year during untreated infection 13, 16, 17, compared to ~4 years for replication-competent and ~17 years for defective proviruses during ART18-20. As a result, on-ART proviral composition is typically skewed towards proviruses that were archived in the year or two prior to ART initiation12-15, 21, 22. Nevertheless, proviruses that integrated throughout untreated infection, including those dating back to transmission, are routi nely recovered during suppressive ART12-15, and some individuals' notably retain that nearly fully recapitulate their within-host HIV evolutionary history12. Critically, only an estimated ~5% of prov iruses persisting on ART are genetically intact and potentially capable of pr oducing replication-competent HIV23-25. The remaining ~95% are defective due to large genomic deletions, hypermutation, packaging signal region defects, inversions or scrambles of genes, inactivating point mutations and/or internal stop codons 23, 25, 26. Though cells harbouring such defective proviruses cannot produce replication-competent HIV, some can produce HIV mRNAs and even proteins24, 27, allowing them to be recognized and eliminated by the immune system27, 28. It has also recently been shown that defective proviruses can contribute to plasma viremia29. 131This raises the question of whether defecti ve proviruses might also contribute to episodes of low-level HIV viremia observed in some individuals despite ART30, 31, a hypothesis that is supported by the observation that on-ART residual plasma viremia correlates with levels of both cell-associated HIV RNA and DNA 32. Together, these observations suggest that detailed characterization of defective proviruses is also relevant to HIV cure intervention development In particular, knowledge gaps remain in our understanding of the influence of genomic integrity on proviral longevity. While recent on-ART longitudinal studies (using proviral quantification methods that discriminate intact from defective genomes 19, 33, 34, proviral sequencing35, or both36) indicate that intact proviruses decay more rapidly than defective ones, these studies did not elucidate the ages of individual proviral sequences (whether intact or defective). Moreover, wh ile a number of studies have used within-host phylogenetic approaches to elucidate the integration dates of proviruses sampled during ART 12-15, 21, 22, all but one exclusively collected sub-genomic sequences, many of which are likely to be defective elsewhere in the genome23, 25, while the remaining one exclusively sampled replication-competent HIV obtained after ex vivo stimulation22. Of note, the latter study showed the strongest skewing towards sequences that integrated near ART, consistent with the notion that intact proviruses also turn over more rapidly than defective ones during untreated infection. No studies to our knowledge have leveraged information from pre-ART within- host evolutionary history to elucidate the integration dates of intact pr oviruses, defective proviruses, ex vivo reactivated HIV sequences along with plasma HIV RNA sequences from both rebound and low level viremia events during otherwise long-term suppressive ART. Here, we employed a phylogenetic approach 12 to investigate the age distribution of these diverse types of persisting HIV sequences in six individuals who had been receiving ART for a median of > 9 years. 4.4. Results 4.4.1. Participant characteristics and reservoir sampling We isolated 2,336 near-full- length proviruses (median 352; range 195-733 per participant) by single-genome amplification at a single time point from six individuals with HIV who had been receiving suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) for a median 9.3 132(range 7.2- 12.2) years ( Table 4-1 ). As our quality control procedure verified that each amplicon was sequenced end-to-end (see methods), we could definitively classify each provirus as genome-intact or defective ( i.e. there was no \"inferred intact\" category), and assess clonality. Additional post-ART sampling was performed for 4 participants: from BC-003 and BC-004, we isolated 2 and 7 full-genome HIV RNA sequences, respectively, from limiting-dilution Quantitative Viral Outgrowth Assays (QVOA) performed on the same sample as used for proviral amplification (QVOA was also performed for BC-001 and BC-002, but yielded no viral outgrowth)( Table 4-1 ). From participant BC-001 we isolated 9 subgenomic ( nef) HIV RNA sequences from a viremia rebound event following ART interruption under the assumption that t hese represented replic ation competent HIV emerging from the Table 4-1 ). From BC-001, BC-002 and RNA sequences from low-level viremi a (LLV) events during ART, hypothesizing that these represented HIV RNA emerging from the reservoir from proviruses of varying genomic integrity ( Table 4-1) . (median 141; range 65-221 per parti cipant) from a median 8 (range 4- 17) historic longitudinal plasma samples t hat spanned a median 7.1 (range 0.75- 14.25) years prior to ART ( Table 4-1 ). These were used to reconstruct participants' within-host HIV's evolutionary histories and to infer reservoir ages, as described below. The nef region was used because it is rich in phylogenetic signal and it is representative of within-host HIV diversity elsewhere in the genome 12, and it is more likely to be intact in proviral sequences25, thereby maximizing the number of proviruses whose integration dates could be inferred. All participants had HIV subtype B, and sequences were monophyletic with no evidence of recombination or eristics and Sampling Summary Participant Years of pre-ART sampling (n time points) Number of pre-ART HIV RNA sequences collected (% unique) Subsequent years of ART Number of proviral sequences collected on ART BC-001 10 (15) 102 (91%) 9.5 317 BC-002 9.5 (17) 160 (82%) 9.6 265 BC-003 4.75 (8) 122 (93%) 8.7 733 BC-004 0.75 (4) 65 (91%) 9.1 440 BC-021 2.5 (8) 221 (79%) 12.2 386 BC-027 14.25 (7) 215 (82%) 7.2 195 Participant Number of QVOA sequences collected on ART (% unique) Number of rebound HIV RNA sequences collected (% unique) Number of low-level viremia sequences unique) BC-001 BC-002 - - BC-003 BC-004 7 (100%) - 90 (9%) BC-021 - - - BC-027 - - - 4.4.2. Proviral landscape during long-term ART We begin by describing each participant's on-ART proviral landscape. Participant BC-001 had been receiving suppressive ART for 9.5 years prior to proviral sampling ( Table 4-1 ). Of the 317 near full-length proviruses collected, only five (2%) were intact, all of which were unique ( Figure 4-1A, Table 4-2 ). This proportion was slightly lower than the 5% intact predicted by the IPDA, which quantified 85 intact out of a total of 1,757 HIV Copies/Million CD4+ T-cells ( Figure 4-1B ). This is not unexpected given the inefficiency of long-template amplification37, as well as the ability of proviral sequencing to capture small defects, such as premature stop codons, that are not captured by the IPDA 25. Proviruses with large deletions were the most common (n=138; 44% overall, 36% of which were clonal), and these varied greatly in length ( e.g. the shortest provirus was only 497 base pairs) ( Figure 4-1A ). These typically featured a 134single large deletion that broadly spanned hal f or nearly the whole genome (proviruses with two or more smaller deletions were less common), and many had additional defects such as gene inversions, scrambles and hypermutation. Hypermutated proviruses were the next (n=95; 30% overall; of which 20% were clonal), followed by those with packaging signal defects (n=68; 21%, of which 84% were clonal). Sequences prematur chimeras made up only 3% of BC-001's proviral pool. These included four sequences with inversions (2 unique), each of which began with a short portion of gag in the reverse orientation with the remainder of the genome in the correct orientation, one sequence with a scramble in env, two unique sequences with premature stop codons in pol, and four unique HIV-Human chimeras consisting of a partial nef fused to portion of chromosome 11, 6 or 22. Overall, 128 of BC-001's 317 proviruses (40%) represented one of 18 clones, each recovered between 2 - 32 times ( Figures 4-1C, 4-1D ). Among these were a provirus with a packaging signal defect (recovered 20 times), one with a ~7,500 base deletion with only partial env and nef remaining (recovered 24 times) and one with a packaging signal defect (recovered 32 times), which together made up 24% of the proviral pool. Nef was the most commonly intact gene: 131 (41%) harboured an intact nef. 135 Figure 4-1 Proviral land scape for participant BC-001. panel A : Graphic depicting the 317 near-f ull-length proviral genomes isolated from BC-001, stratified by tact genomes are depicted in lime green; defective provirus types are depicted in other colors as shown in the l egend.

Only one (0.4%) of the 265 proviruses recovered was intact (Figure 4-2A, Table 4-2 ), which was lower than the 5% estimated by IPDA (99 Intact out of 4,052 Total HIV Copies per Million CD4+ T-cells; Figure 4-2B ). Proviruses with large most abundant (n=201; overall 76%; 38% clonal), where the shortest provirus was only 263 bases ( Figure 4-2A ). Next most frequent were hypermutated proviruses (n= 34, 13%), those with packaging 15, 6%), and unique inversions (n=9; 3%). One sequence with a scramble in env and four unique sequences with premature stop codons were also recove red. Overall, 81 of BC-002's proviruses (31%) represented one of 16 clones, eac h recovered between 2 - 19 times ( Figures 4- 2C, -2D ). The two largest clones, isolated 19 times each, harboured ~4,800 and ~8,500 base deletions. Nef was the gene (n= participant BC-002. Same as Figure 4-1, except for the 265 proviruses isolated for BC-002. Participant BC-003 received suppressive ART for 8.7 years prior to proviral sampling ( Table 4-1 ). Of the 733 proviruses recovered, 15 (2%) were intact (11 were unique) ( Figure 4-3A, Table 4-2 ), which was substantially lower than the 12% intact estimated by the IPDA (328 intact of 1,930 of participant had revealed a 47% frequency of naive cells21, which have been shown to be enriched in 5% 199 Intact HIV the next most abundant (n=285; 39%), where some clearly highlighted how template switching between repeated genomic elements during reverse transcription can lead to the reproducible formation of large deletions at the same sites 39, 40. For example, we recovered two distinct sequences with a deletion spanning HXB2 coordinates 3,698 - 9,589, where the 5' end of the deletion, and the bases immediately following it, were 'GGGAA'. Moreover, such deletion \"hotspots\" are consistent across individuals. For example, 13 distinct sequences from BC-003 had a deletion spanning HXB2 4,781 - 9,064, where the 5' end of the deletion, and the bases immediately following it, were 'TTTTAAAAGAAAAGGGGGGA'. These exact deletion breakpoints were observed in one of BC-001's proviruses, one of BC- 004's, 11 unique proviruses recovered from BC-021, and have previously been described by others 23, 26. Proviruses with packaging signal defects comprised 5% of BC- 003's reservoir (n= 34 sequences), stop codons (n=6) and a single human-HIV chimera, featuring a partial nef fused to chromosome 6, were also recover ed. Overall, 121 (17%) of BC-003's proviruses represented one of 31 clones, each re covered between 2 - 23 times ( Figures 4-3C, - 3D). The largest clone, isolated 23 times, contained a ~7,000 base pair deletion. Gag was the most commonly intact gene in BC-003's dataset (n=201; 27%, n= 201), followed by nef (n =115; 16%), values that are lower than average due to the high proportion of hypermutated proviruses. 139 Figure 4-3 Proviral landscape for participant BC-003. Same as Figure 4-1, except for t he 733 proviruses isolated for BC-003. Participant BC-004 was virally suppressed fo r 9.1 years prior to proviral sampling (Table 4-1 ). Of the 440 proviruses recovered, 47 (11%) were intact (24 unique) ( Figure 4-4A ), consistent with the IPDA estimate of defects the most common, though proviruses with inversions premature stop codons (n=4) and two unique HIV-human chimeras, both of which combined a portion of nef (or a portion of env and nef) with chromosome 6 were also recovered. Overall, 169 (38%) proviruses 12% 238 times ( Figures 4-4C, -4D ). Nef (n=165; 38%). Figure 4-4 Proviral landscape for participant BC-004. Same as Figure 4-1, except for t he 440 proviruses isolated for BC-004. Participant BC-021 received suppressive cA RT for 12.2 years prior to proviral sampling ( Table 4-1 ). Of the 386 proviruses recover ed, nine (2%, four unique) were intact ( Figure 4-5A, Table 4-2 ), which is less than the 9% estimated by IPDA, which measured 70 intact out of 765 Total HIV Copies/Million CD4+ T-cells ( Figure 4-5B ). Large deletions were by far the most common, (n= 349, 90%), followed by packaging 9% 160 with premature stop codons in env and one with a scramble were also recovered. Overall, 140 sequences represented one of 30 clones that were recovered between 2- 37 times ( Figure 4-5C, -5D ). The largest clone, a provirus a ~5,500 base deletion, comprised 10% of all proviruses recovered. Gag and nef were the most commonly intact genes in recovered proviruses (n=145; 38% and n= 93; 24%, scape for participant BC-021 . Same as Figure 4-1, except for t he 386 proviruses isolated for BC-021. 9% 70 Intact proviral sampling ( Table 4-1 ). Of 195 proviruses recovered, 14 (7%, 6 unique) were intact (Figure 4-6A, Table 4-2 ), which was comparable to the IPDA estimate of 6% (32 intact of 517 Total HIV Figure 4-6B signal defects (n= 44; 23%) were the most common, though seven hypermutated proviruses and one with an inversion were also recovered ( Figure 4-6A ). BC-027's proviral pool exhibited the greatest clonality of all participants studied, where 107 (55%) sequences represented one of 18 clones recovered between 2- 39 times (Figure 4-6C, -6D ). The dominant clone, harbouring a represented 20% of all proviruses recovered. Nef was the most commonly intact gene among recovered proviruses (65%, n= 127). 143 Figure 4-6 Proviral landscap e for participant BC-027. Same as Figure 4-1, except for t he 195 proviruses isolated for BC-027. 4.4.3. Clonality varies by proviral genomic integrity As clonal expansion is an important driver of HIV persistence41, we investigated whether clonal sequence frequency differed by proviral genomic integrity. In a combined analysis across participants, intact proviruses were significantly enriched for clonally expanded sequences ( Figure 4-7A ): 19% of intact compared to 8% of other proviruses were part of a clonal set (Odds Ratio [OR] 2.7; p= 0.01). Proviruses with packaging signal defects were also more likely to be clones (OR 2.8; p=0.0007; Figure 4-7B ), but 6% deletions (p=0.6; Figure 4-7C ). Hypermutated proviruses by contrast were less to clones (OR 0.51; p=0.0009, Figure 4-7D ). Figure 4-7 Relationship between proviral sequence integrity and likelihood of being clonal. Each panel investigates a specific type of provirus, where the co mparison group is all proviruses not belonging to that category. The proportion of clonal sequence s is in yellow, with unique sequences in purple. P-values ar e computed using Fisher's exact test and are not corrected for multiple comparisons. 4.4.4. Do intact and defective proviruses differ in age? We next used a phylogenetic approach12 to investigate whether intact reservoir sequences differ from the much larger pool of defective proviruses persisting on ART with respect to their longevity. To do this, we inferred a random sample of 1,500 - related longitudinal pre-ART plasma HIV RNA nef sequences with the HIV sequence s whose integration dates we wished to estimate (where these inclu ded on-ART proviruses, QVOA outgrowth sequences, HIV RNA isolated from low-level viremia on-ART, and HIV RNA isolated after ART interruption). Inferring a large number of trees mitigates the uncertainty in within-host phylogenetic reconstruction. Next, we rooted each phylogeny at the location that represents the inferred most recent common ancestor of the dataset. If plasma HIV RNA sampling goes back far enough, this root would represent the transmission event; if it does not go back far enough, it would repres ent a descendant of this founder. We then fit a linear model relating the root-to-tip genet ic distances of unique pre-ART plasma HIV RNA nef sequences to their sampling dates. The slope, which represents the average within-host pre-ART nef evolutionary rate, was then used to convert the root-to-tip distance of any sequence of interest to its integration date. We conditioned these dates over all phylogenies that met our quality control criteria (see methods), yielding integration date point estimates and 95% high est posterior density (HPD) intervals for each sequence of interest. As this analysis requires an intact nef, it was restricted to intact nef-containing proviruses (median 121; range 70- 165 proviruses per a median 32% (range 16- 65%) of proviruses collected. Participant BC-001 Participant BC-001 was diagnosed with HIV in August 1996. He initiated ART in August 2006 but interrupted shortly thereafter, and did not durably suppress until June 2008 ( Figure 4-8A ). We collected 102 (93 unique) plasma HIV RNA nef sequences from 15 pre-ART time points spanning ~10 years, al ong with 317 proviruses from a single time point in June 2016, ~9.5 years after ART initiation, 131 (41%) of which had an intact nef (Figure 4-8A, Table 4-1 ). We also isolated nine (five unique) HIV RNA nef sequences from the September 2007 viremia rebound (to 23,000 HIV RNA copies/mL) following initial ART interruption, and one from a viremia \"blip\" (to 76 HIV RNA copies/ml) in September 2015. All 1,500 rooted within-host phylogenies showed strong molecular clock signal, with linear models yielding a median AIC of 148 (I nterquartile Range [IQR] 131- 164) and an and 4-8C) . Consistent with the participant's mid-1996 HIV diagnosis, the mean root date of months to the participant's HIV diagnosis date. The unique proviral and HIV RNA sequences sampled post-ART interspersed throughout the phylogeny , consistent with their continual archiving throughout infection ( Figure 4-8B ). Dating these sequences using the linear model revealed that the oldest, a provirus with a large deletion, was estimated to have integrated in May 1997, approxim ately 19 years prior to sampling, while the youngest was estimated to have integrated in March 2008, during the ART interruption, consistent with reservoir re-seeding during this rebound event. Overall, ~50% of sequences were estimated to have integrated between the 1.25 years prior to ART and the rebound event, which is consistent with reports that reservoirs are typically enriched in sequences that integrated around the time of ART initiation 13-15, 22. Strikingly, all old sequences (those that had integrated in 2001 or prior) were defective proviruses, whereas all intact prov iruses, as well as the 9 HIV RNA sequences that were isolated from the 2007 viremia r ebound, that presumably represent intact, replication-competent HIV em erging from the reservoir, were estimated to have integrated in the 2.75 years prior to ART ( Figure 4-8D ). Though this supports the hypothesis that the intact reservoir is overall younger than the much larger defective proviral pool, this comparison did not reach statistical significance (p= 0.28 Figure 4- 8D), as a substantial fraction of defective prov iruses also dated to this period. Of note, the sequence isolated from the 2015 viremia \"blip\" was estimated to have integrated in March 2006, close to ART initiation. Integration dates did not significantly differ between types of defective proviruses (Kruskal-Wallis p=0.05). 147 Figure 4-8 Within-host HIV evolutionary reconstruction and integration date inference of on-ART sequen ces for participant BC-001. 148panel A: Participant clinical and samplin g history.

Participant BC-002 Participant BC-002 was diagnosed with HIV in April 1995 ( Figure 4-9A ). Viremia was incompletely suppressed on dual ART between July 2000 and December 2006, at which point suppression was achieved on triple ART. Viral suppression was maintained until May 2011, after which frequent low-level viremia occurred, reaching a peak of 1,063 copies HIV RNA/mL in March 2013. A total of 160 (131 unique, 82%) plasma HIV RNA nef sequences were collected from 17 time points spanning 9.5 years pre-ART ( Figure 4-9A, Table 4-1 ), along with 265 proviruses sampled from a single on-ART time point in August 2016, 9.6 years after ART initia tion, 70 (26%) of which had an intact nef. We also isolated 13 (10 unique) plasma HIV RNA nef sequences from the 2013 low-level viremia. All 1,500 rooted within-host phylogenies exhibited a strong molecular clock ( AIC median 106; IQR 82-121), yielding Figures -9C ). The (95% HPD 25-August-1989 - 30-October-1994), three years prior to diagnosis. Proviral and HIV RNA sequences sampled on ART interspersed through the tree, where the oldest one, a defective provirus, was estimated to have integrated in the first year of infection, maki ng it nearly 21 years old at time of sampling (Figure 4-9D ). Nevertheless, approximately 50% of proviruses were estimated to have integrated in the 2.25 years prior to ART. 149Like BC-001, all of BC-002's old provir uses (those estimated to have integrated in 1999 or earlier) were defective. By contrast, the single intact provirus was estimated to have integrated in 2004, though many defective proviruses dating to around this time were also recovered. Notably, the HIV RNA sequences recovered during persistent low-level viremia were highly genetically diverse and included sequences dating as far back as 1995; in fact these sequences were overall on average slightly older than sampled proviruses (p=0.027; Figure 4-9D ). Of note, four of these old low-level viremia sequences, one of which was recovered four ti mes, mapped to a single clade where the most closely related sequence was a defective provirus ( Figure 4-9D , near top of tree). This suggests that defective proviruses might contribute to low-level viremia, though we cannot rule out that this viremia was driven by intact proviruses that we were not able to sample. Proviruses with defects tended to be slightly younger than those with large deletions (p= 0.043) though otherwise no age differences were found between defective proviral types ( Figure 4-9D ). 150 Figure 4-9 Within-host evolutionary reconstruction and integration date inference of on-ART sequen ces for participant BC-002. Same as Figure 4-8, except for participant BC-002. In panel A , the yellow shading denotes the period of non-suppressi ve dual ART. In panel D , the Kruskal-Wallis test comparing the three 151types of defective proviruses was statistically significant, so the p-values for the individual between-group comparisons, corrected for multiple comparisons, are shown. Participant BC-003 Participant BC-003 was diagnosed with HIV in 2002 before achieving viral suppression on ART in October 2007 ( Figure 4-10A ). Suppression was largely maintained for ~ 9 years with the exception of low-level viremia (<250 HIV RNA copies/mL) in April 2010 and June 2015. We isolated 122 (113 unique, 93%) plasma HIV RNA nef sequences from 8 pre-ART time point s spanning 4.75 years, along with 733 proviruses on-ART, of which 115 (16%) had an intact nef (Figure 4-10A, Table 4-1 ). We also isolated one full and one partial HIV RNA genome from limiting-dilution QVOA performed on the same sample as the proviral isolation, but attempts to isolate HIV RNA from low-level viremia were unsuccessful ( Figure 4-10A, Table 4-1 ). All 4,500 rooted within-host phylogenies showed strong molecular clock signal (median AIC 137; IQR 120- 156), yielding a mean (95% HPD 6- February-2001 - 27-August-2002), which was only a few months prior to diagnosis (representative phylogeny and linear model in Figure 4-10B, - 10C). Except for two proviruses that were estimated to have integrated in 2002 and 2004, both with large deletions, all other sequences dated to the 2.75 years prior to ART (Figure 4-10C, 4-10D ). Nevertheless, intact pr oviruses and HIV RNA sequences isolated from QVOA were on average significantly younger than defective proviruses (p=0.03; Figure 4-10D ). No significant differences were observed between defective proviral types (Kruskal-Wallis p= 0.8). 152 Figure 4-10 Within-host HIV evolutionary reconstruction and integration date inference of on-ART sequen ces for participant BC-003. Same ept for participant BC-003. 153Participant BC-004 Participant BC-004 was diagnosed with HI V in 2005. In contrast to all other participants who initiated ART in advanced chronic infection, BC-004 initiated ART within ~18 months of diagnosis ( Figure 4-11A ). BC-004 experienced intermittent low-level viremia for 4 years after ART initiation, but was otherwise suppressed except for another \"blip\" in 2019. We isolated 65 (59 unique, 91%) plasma HIV RNA nef sequences from 4 pre-ART time points spanning 8 months, al ong with 440 proviral genomes (165; 38% with an intact nef), and RNA genomes from QVOA ( Figure 4-11A, Table 4-1). We also isolated 46 (4 unique) and 44 (4 unique) plasma HIV RNA nef sequences from the low-level viremia in 2011 and 2019, respectively. Of the 1,500 rooted within-host phylogenies, only 379 (25%) had sufficient molecular clock signal to pass quality control criteria (median AIC 13.5; IQR 11.5- 16. 1), which is not surprising given that early ART initiation limited the extent of within-host HIV evolution. The passing models yielded a mean pre-ART nef evolutionary Figures -11C ) and mean root HPD 14-October-2004 - 4- September-2005), consistent with HIV diagnos is during early infection. Due to the uncertainty of inferring within-host HIV evol utionary rates from the very limited pre-ART period in this participant, estimated integration dates featured wide 95% HPD intervals, and therefore these dates (and associated analyses) should be interpreted with some caution. Though no significant differences we re observed between intact and defective proviruses (p=0.41), it was interesting that the oldest provirus, estimated to have integrated in October 2005, 6 months following transmission, was defective due to a large deletion ( Figure 4-11D ). Moreover, and consistent with BC-002, sequences isolated from both low-level viremia events ex clusively dated to th e earliest infection stage, and therefore were over all significantly older than both intact (p=0.0002) and defective (p=0.0005) sequences sequences mapped to a single sub-clade that contained both intact and defective proviruses sampled on ART, along with plasma HIV RNA sequences sampled at the earliest time point ( Figure 4-11B , near top of tree). This suggests that the viremia blips in both 2011 and 2019 originated from a single ancestral within-host lineage that had subsequently gone extinct in plasma shortly following infection, but where both intact and defective proviruses representing this lineage persisted for >15 years and 154contributed to persistent low-level viremia. In tegration dates of defective proviruses did not differ based on defect type (Kruskal-Wallis p= 0.48). 155 Figure 4-11 Within-host HIV evolutionary reconstruction and integration date inference of on-ART sequen ces for participant BC-004. Same ept for participant BC-004. 156Participant BC-021 Participant BC-021 was diagnosed with HIV in November 2002 and achieved viral suppression on ART in April 2007 ( Figure 4-12A ). Suppression was largely maintained thereafter except for a \"blip\" to 367 HIV RNA copies/mL in May 2018 from which sequence isolation was unsuccessful. We isolated 221 (175 unique, 79%) plasma HIV RNA nef sequences from 8 pre-cART time points spanning 2.5 years and 386 proviruses from a single time point in July 2019, of which 93 (24%) had an intact nef gene ( Figure 4-12A, Table 4-1 ). All 3,000 rooted phylogenies demonstrated strong molecular clock signal (median AIC 263 [IQR 239- 282]), yielding a mean 12B, 4-12C ). 18-December-2001- 21- August-2002), which was only slightly later than the participant's estimated 2001 infection date. BC-021's proviral pool, both intact and defective, was markedly skewed in age, with 63 of the 65 (97%) unique sequences dating to the 2 years prior to ART (Figure 4-12D ). Though intact and defective proviruses did not significantly differ in age (p=0.99), it was notable that t he two old proviruses, the oldest of which was estimated to have integrated in May 2003, 16 years prior to sampling, both harboured large deletions. There were no significant age differences between defective provirus types (p=0.1, Figure 4-12D ). 157 Figure 4-12 Within-host evolutionary reconstruction and integration date inference of on-ART sequen ces for participant BC-021. Same ept for participant BC-021. 158Participant BC-027 Participant BC-027 was diagnosed with HIV in 1985, received various non- suppressive ART regimens beginning in the mid-1990s, and finally achieved suppression in December 2011, which was maintained except for two blips <80 copies mL from which sequence isolation was unsuccessful ( Figure 4-13A ). We isolated 215 (176 unique, 82%) pre-ART plasma HIV RNA nef sequences from 7 time points spanning a ~14 year period, along with 195 pr oviruses on-ART in 2019, of which 127 (65%) had an intact nef (Figure 4-13A, Table 4-1 ). All 1,500 within-host rooted molecular clock signal (median AIC: 366), yielding a Figure 3-January-1990 - 11-March-1995) , indicating that we did not reconstruct back to the founder virus but rather one of its descendants. Though integration dates did not significantly differ between intact and defective proviruses (p=0.96), it was again notable that all of the old proviruses, the oldest of which was estimated to have integrated in 1996 ( i.e. ~23 years prior to sampling) were defective. Notably, BC-027 was the only participant for whom no proviruses were recovered that dated to the earliest years of infection (1996 was approximately 10 years followi ng infection). Defective proviruses did not differ significantly in p=0.31) ( Figure 4-13D ). 159 Figure 4-13 reconstruction and integration date inference of on-ART sequen ces for participant BC-027. Same as Figure 4-8, exc ept for participant BC-027. 1604.4.5. Estimated integration date distribution does not differ by clonality We concluded by investigating whether estimated reservoir integration date distribution varied between unique versus clonal sequences (sequences isolated from viral rebound and low-level viremia events were not included here, as only nef was sequenced). No difference in the estimated in tegration date distribution between clonal and unique sequences was observed in any participant ( Figure 4-14A-F , all p>0.1). This remained true when within-host sequences were additionally stratified by genomic integrity (data not shown, all p>0.13). 161 Figure 4-14 Lack of relationship between sequence clonality and age. Estimated integration dates of distinct proviruses that were observed two or more times (clonal) versus only once (unique), where each panel depicts one participant. Open diamonds denote defective proviruses; closed diamonds include in tact proviruses as well as HIV RNA sequences recovered from ex vivo reactivation (QVOA), if any. 4.5. Discussion For four of the six participants (BC-001 through BC-004), we had previously used similar methods to infer the ages of subgenomic ( nef) proviral sequences sampled on ART12, 21, but these studies did not allow us to explore relationships re-sampled near-full-genome proviruses from these four participants along with two others to address these questions. As expected23, 25, 42, on-ART proviral pools were overwhelmingly defective, with an overall median of only 2% genomically intact sequences. Proviruses with large deletions dominated in 5 of 6 participants, where identification of consistent deletion breakpoints around repeated HIV genomic motifs, both within and across individuals, underscored the reproducible mechanisms whereb y these deletions are generated 23, 26. By contrast, hypermutated proviruses dominated (53%) in a sixth participant, possibly due to their unusually high proportion (47%) of na\u00efve CD4+ T-cells, which have been shown to be enriched in hypermutated proviruses 38. Heterogeneity in proviral composition was also clearly illustrated by the ma rked variation in each partici pant's proporti on of clonal sequences, which varied from 17 to 55%. Notably, we found that the odds of being part of a clonal set were greater for intact (as well as -defective) proviruses, and lesser for hypermutated ones. This may again be due to proviral distribution across CD4+ T-cell subsets38: While intact and defective proviruses have been shown to be enriched in effector memory CD4+ T-cells (T EM), which have the highest proliferative capacity38, 43, hypermutated proviruses have been shown to be enriched in naive CD4+ T-cells , which have the lowest proliferative capacity38, 43, 44. These results suggest that clonal expansion plays a particularly prominent role in the persistence of intact and -defective proviruses, and highlight how inter-individual differences in features su as CD4+ T-cell subset distribution can influence within-host proviral composition. The results also extend our understanding of proviral dynamics and persistence. Consistent with prior studies13-15, 22, on-ART proviral pools were generally skewed towards variants archived in the years immediately preceding ART initiation, though the degree of skewing ranged from relatively subtle ( e.g. participant BC-001) to quite pronounced ( e.g participant BC-021). Despite this skewing, sequences dating to earlier periods of untreated infection were recovered in all participants, including sequences dating to shortly following infection in five of six participants, some of which had been persisting for more than 20 years at time of sampling. The only exception was BC-027, who acquired HIV in 1985: the oldest sequence recovered from this individual dated to 1996, 11 years following infection but still r oughly 23 years prior to sampling. Overall, these results confirm that proviruses are continually archived throughout untreated 163infection, where heterogeneous rates of within -host pre-ART proviral turnover influence the extent to which a given individual's proviral pool skews towards more recently-archived sequences over time, as older sequences are gradually eliminated 13, 16, 17. Importantly, our results extend prior studies by demonstrating that, in all participants, the oldest proviruses were in all cases defective. While age differences between intact and defective proviruses were not statistically significant in most participants due to limited recovery of intact sequences (except BC -003, where this difference did reach significance), this observation is nevertheless consistent with more rapid turnover of intact proviruses 19, 33, 35, likely because of their higher potential for viral protein expression and thus immune-mediated elimination27, 35. Indeed, our observation that intact proviruses are significantly more likely to be clonal than those harbouring large deletions is consistent with latter having an inherent persistence advantage even without clonal expansion, where this advantage is likely attributable to lower likelihood of immune elimination due to limited or no viral antigen presentation. These results also explain existing observations that replicat ion-competent HIV sequences are even more skewed towards integration dates closer to ART 22, compared to the overall largely defective proviral pool12-15, 21. Of note, even though we observed differential clonality by genomic integrity, there was no evidence that clonal sequences were the most ancient (and in fact the oldest recovered sequence in each individual was never part of a clonal set). Taken together, our results suggest that, although lack of genomic integrity can increase the likelihood of proviral persistenc e, this is not achieved through clonal expansion (particularly for proviruses with large deletions). In three participants (BC-001, BC-002 and BC-004), we additionally sampled plasma HIV RNA during on-ART low-level viremi a. Strikingly, in two of these individuals (BC-002 and BC-004), recovered sequences included some of the oldest isolated within-host. In BC-002, the oldest sequences recovered from low-level viremia clustered closely with a defective provirus sequence, while in BC-004, all low-level viremia sequences clustered within an ancestral clade that included both intact and defective proviruses. By contrast, the single low-level viremia sequence isolated from BC-001 dated to the year prior to ART initiation, and was most closely related to an intact sequence. These results suggest that proviruses capable of reactivating to produce low- level viremia are highly heterogeneous, can be extremely long-lived, and may in some cases originate from proviruses with genetic defects, though we cannot rule out failure to 164sample the proviruses most closely related to these reactivating sequences. Nevertheless, the recent observation that defective proviruses contribute to plasma viremia during untreated infection 29 supports this notion. By contrast, in the one individual for whom we sampled plasma HIV RNA variants that rebounded to high levels following ART interruption (BC-001), these sequences uniformly dated to the year prior to ART, consistent with them being derived from more recently-integrated, intact and replication-competent proviruses. Our study has some limitations. Despite extensive sampling, we recovered fewer intact proviruses than anticipated based on IPDA measurements, reflecting the inefficiency of long-range PCR 37. We isolated proviruses directly from bulk-purified CD4+ T-cells, so we could not investigate proviral distribution across T-cell subsets. As we did not determine integration site we cannot definitively state that identical sequences are clonal, though the likelihood is extremely high as we only included sequences that were sequenced end-to-end, and a prior study demonstrated that proviruses with 100% sequence identity have the same integration site 45. On the other hand, we also acknowledge that sequences we isolated only once may still be part of a clonal set, where other clones remained un-sampled. Our phylogenetic approach for inferring HIV integration dates assumes a strict molecula r clock, which may not be ideal over long time frames46. Lastly, because nef was used to calibrate within-host clocks, we could only infer the integration dates of sequences with an intact nef gene. Though nef was the most (or second most) likely HIV gene to be intact among proviruses in all participants, we cannot rule out differential age distributions of proviruses with defective versus intact nef sequences, which is not implausible as there is evidence that an intact nef promotes proviral longevity 38. Nevertheless, the consistency of our proviral age distributions with prior studies13-15, 22 that have used gag and env for dating suggests that our results are not overly biased. There are also no ideal solutions to this challenge, as the high prevalence of proviruses with large deletions means that no single HIV region can be used to date all proviruses phylogenetically, nor can hypermutated sequences be dated using such approaches. Our study also has some strengths. To ou r knowledge, it is the first to use phylogenetic methods to simultaneously infer the ages of intact and defective proviruses, along with ex vivo and in vivo reactivated HIV sequences. Moreover, as these sequences were largely sampled after a median of 9.5 years of ART, during the much 165slower second phase of on-ART decay19, 20, they more accurately represent the truly long-lived reservoir. We addressed the key issue of within-host phylogenetic reconstruction uncertainty by inferring 1,500- 4,500 phylogenies per participant using Bayesian approaches, and conditioning all integr ation (and root) dates over all trees. Moreover, as opposed to approaches that date sequences by phylogenetic clustering, which have the limitation of only being able to assign sequences of interest to the dates that pre-ART plasma HIV RNA sequences were sampled 22, 47, our method converts a sequence's root-to-tip distance to its integr ation date using a host-specific rate of evolution inferred from longitudinal pre-AR T HIV RNA sequences, allowing dates earlier than the first sampled pre-ART plasma sequence, and later than the last, to be assigned. This is important in cases such as BC-021 whose pre-ART sampling stops ~2 years prior to ART initiation, but where substantial HIV evolution and proviral archiving undoubtedly took place during this time. Overall, our observations are consistent with clonal expansion as a mechanism to sustain intact proviral lineages 41, but suggest that it is less critical for sustaining proviruses with large deletions and hyper mutation, which already possess an inherent persistence advantage through decreased likelihood of viral protein expression. Our results also strongly suggest that the (typica lly smaller) population of extremely long- lived proviruses that are found in nearly all individuals on ART are all defective. This, along with our observation that all intact proviruses as well as HIV sequences from ex vivo and in vivo rebound events dated to near ART initiation, strongly suggests that genomic integrity reduces proviral longevity. In striking contrast to HIV isolated from rebound events however, a subst antial proportion of those isolated from low-level viremia on ART were among the oldest within-host sequences recovered, with phylogenetic analysis suggesting a potential defective proviral origin for some. The anatomical and cellular sources and genomic integrity of proviruses fueling low-level viremia requires additional investigation before firmly concluding that HIV remission strategies need only focus on eliminating the smaller subset of genetically younger proviruses. 1664.6. Methods 4.6.1. Participants and sampling We recruited six participants with HIV through the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS in Vancouver, Canada. All were male, and had initiated ART a median 7.9 (range 1.9- 26.5) years after HIV diagnosis. A median 8 (range 4- 17) longitudinal plasma samples per participant we re studied in order to reconstruct pre-ART within-host HIV evolutionary hi stories. At the time of per ipheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) sampling on ART, participants' plas ma viral loads had been largely suppressed for a median 9.3 (range 7.2- 12.2) years. At this time, PBMCs were isolated from whole blood by density gradient centrifugation and cryopreserved at -150\u00b0C until use. We additionally studied a plasma sample from a viremia rebound event following ART interruption (BC-001), as well as plasma samples from on-ART 4.6.2. Ethics statement Ethical approval to conduct this study was obtained from the research ethics boards of Providence Health Care/ Universi ty of British Columbia and Simon Fraser University. All participants provided written informed consent. 4.6.3. Intact Proviral DNA Assay (IPDA) Intact and total proviral DNA loads was quantified for each participant using the Intact Proviral DNA Assay (IPDA)25, 48. Briefly, CD4+ T-cells Human CD4+ T-cell Enrichment Kit, StemCell Technologies) and genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA MiniKit (Qiagen) with precautions to minimize DNA shearing. Quantification of HIV and human DNA was performed in independent wells on the same assay plate, where copies were normalized to input DNA quantity. Each ddPCR reaction combined 7ng (RPP30) or 700ng (HIV) of Probes (no dUTPs, BioRad), primers (final concentration 900nM, Integrated DNA Technologies), probes (final concentration 250nM, ThermoFisher Scientific), XhoI restriction en zyme (New England autologous probe (VIC-CCTTGGGTT TCTGGGA-MGBNFQ) was used, as the published IPDA probe failed due to these polymorphisms48. Droplets were generated using an Automated Droplet Generator (B ioRad) and cycled at 95\u00b0C for 10 min; 45 cycles of (94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 59\u00b0C for 1 min) and 98\u00b0C for 10 minutes. Droplets were read using a QX200 Droplet Reader (BioRad) and analyzed in QuantaSoft (BioRad, version 1.7.1), where replicate wells were merged prior to analysis. Intact HIV copies ( and env double-positive droplets) were corrected for DNA shearing based on the frequency of RPP30 and RPP30-Shear double-positive droplets. Total HIV copies were also estimated based on intact and defective provirus frequencies. 4.6.4. Near full-length DNA extracted from CD4+ T-cells using Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen), where IPDA -determined total proviral loads were used to dilute DNA such that no more than 30% of resulting PCR reactions yielded min; 10 cycles of (92\u00b0C for 10 sec, 60\u00b0C for 20 sec and 68\u00b0C for 10 min); 20 cycles of (92\u00b0C for 10 sec, 55\u00b0C for 30 sec and 68\u00b0C for 10 min); 68\u00b0C for 10 min. Amplicons were prepared using Library Prep Kit (Illumina) and sequenced (Illumina 168MiSeq). Reads were de novo assembled using an in-house modification of the Iterative Virus Assembler50 (IVA) implemented in the custom software MiCall ( http://github.com/cfe- lab/MiCall ) to create an HIV consensus sequence. An in-house quality control pipeline then verified that each consensus sequence feat ured least part of the 2nd round forward and reverse primers at its 5' and 3' ends, and a minimum read depth of 100 over all positions; sequences not meeting these criteria were discarded. Verification of the 2nd round primers at each end allows us to confir m that each amplicon was sequenced end- to-end, therefore allowing us to definitively classify each provirus as genome-intact or defective and assess clonality. We validated our pipeline by single-genome sequencing DNA extracted from a cell line with a single in tegrated HIV copy per cell (J-Lat 9.2) in 100 independent replicates, as well as by sequencing a panel of purified pNL4-3 plasmid genomes for which specific gene regions had been excised 51-54. The J-Lat validation yielded 19 consensus base errors out of a total 896,233 bases sequenced ( i.e. an error rate of 1.2 x 10-5), while the plasmid sequencing reconstructed the deletion breakpoints with 100% accuracy in all cases. HIV genomic integrity was determined using an in-house modification of HIV SeqinR55. In this cascading pipeline, sequences less than 8,000 base pairs are classified as defective due to a large deletion. Remaining sequences are NCBI blasted and mapped. Sequences with inversions (portions of the genome in the reverse orientation) or scrambles (genes or portions in the inco rrect order) were classified as defective. Remaining sequences are aligned using MUSCLE 56 and verified for hypermutation using Hypermut 2.057. Non-hypermutated sequences are then translated into amino acids and checked in parallel for insertions/deletions in the packaging signal ( ) region and for internal stop codons in all genes; sequences passing all of these criteria are deemed intact. The SeqinR calls for all non-hypermutated sequences >8,000bp, including all intact calls, were manually verified prio r to final classification. For each non- hypermutated sequence, each HIV gene was excised and checked for the presence of start and stop codons (where applicable), inte rnal stop codons, hypermutation, e.g. large insertions/deletions). 1694.6.5. Reconstruction of within-host HIV evolutionary history from historic plasma samples Each participant's HIV evolutionary hist ory was reconstructed from HIV RNA sub- genomic ( nef) sequences isolated from longitudinal archived plasma, allowing us to interpret on-ART reservoi r diversity in context of this evolution, and infer the integration dates of sequences persisting on ART. To do this, total nucleic acids were extracted from 500mL of plasma on the NucliSENS EasyMag (bioMerieux). cDNA was generated using Expand Reverse Transcriptase (Roche) and endpoint diluted such that subsequent PCR reactions, performed using the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche), yielded no more than 30% positive amplicons. Primers, designed to amplify all major HIV-1 group M subtypes, were (5'-> 3'): (Applied BioSystems) and chromatograms were analyzed using Sequencher (v.5.0, Gene Codes). This same procedure was used to characterize HIV RNA nef sequences from on-ART viremia rebound and low-level viremia events any samples with pVL < 250 copies/mL were DNAse treated after extraction). All HIV RNA sequences were checked for the presence of mixtures, hypermutation or suspected within-host recombination (identified using RDP4 58) prior to phylogenetic inference. 4.6.6. Sequence isolation from Quantitative Viral Outgrowth Assay (QVOA) QVOA59 was performed for four participants for whom sufficient biological material was available (BC-001, BC-002, BC-003 and BC-004). CD4+ T-cells were isolated by negative selection as described abov e and plated in serial dilution at six concentrations, with twelve replicate wells per concentration. CD4+ T-cells were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA , 2ug/mL) HIV- negative PBMCs to induce viral reactivation, with MOLT-4/CCR5 cells added at 24 hours post stimulation as additional target cells. Culture media (RPMI 1640 three days and p24 170enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was run on day 14 to identify virus- positive wells. Infectious Units per Million CD4+ T-cells (IUPM) was determined using the Extreme Limiting Dilution software (v1.0, http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda/ 60), and supernatants from limiting-dilution virus- positive wells were frozen at -80C. For the two participants in whom virus reactivation and replication occurred (BC-003 and BC-004) , near-full length HIV RNA genomes were amplified in five overlapping amplicons from these supernatants, sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq, and assembled as 4.6.7. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic inference Between-host phylogenies were inferred using gag and nef sequences. Briefly, sequences were aligned in a codon-aware manner in MAFFT61 and manually edited in AliView62. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were generated using IQ-Tree63 implemented with automated model selection using ModelFinder64 with an Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) selection criteri on. Branch support values were derived from 1,000 bootstraps. Phylogenies were visualized using the R package ggtree65. Within-host phylogenies, used for reservoir dating, were inferred using nef sequence alignments comprising all unique plasma, proviral and QVOA sequences collected per participant. To mitigate uncertainty in within-host HIV phylogenetic reconstruction, we inferred a minimum 1,500 phylogenies per participant using a Bayesian approaches as follows. The best-fitting substitution model for each dataset was determined using jModelTest (version 2.1.10, 66). Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods were then used to build a random sample of phylogenies for each participant. Two parallel runs with MCMC ch ains of five million generations, sampled every 10,000 generations, were performed in Mr. Bayes (version 3.2.5 67), using the best-fitting substitution model (or second best fitting model when runs did not readily converge) and model-specific or default prio rs. Convergence was assessed by ensuring that the deviation of split frequencies was < 0.03, that the effective sampling size of all parameters was 200 and through visual inspection of parameter traces in Tracer (version1.7.2, 68). The first 25% of iterations were discarded as burn-in. A median 1,500 (range 1,500- 4,500) phylogenies were inferr ed per participant. Node support values are derived from Bayesian posterior probab ilities from the consensus tree. 171Integration dates of on-ART sequences of interest were inferred using a phylogenetic approach12 as follows. As within-host sequence divergence from the transmitted/founder virus increases over time46, 69, 70, each participant's phylogeny was first rooted at the location that maximized the correlation between the root-to-tip distance and the sampling date of the pre-ART plasma HIV RNA sequences . This root represents each dataset's most recent common ancestor (the transmission event if plasma HIV RNA sampling goes back far enough, or a subsequent within-host descendant if it does not). Linear regression was then used to relate the sampling dates of the pre-ART plasma HIV RNA sequences and their root-to- tip divergence, where the slope of the regression represents the aver age evolutionary rate and the x-intercept represents the root date. This regression is then used to co nvert the root-to-tip distances of individual on-ART sequences of interest to their esti mated integration dates. Linear model fit was assessed by comparing the AIC of the null model (a zero slope) with that of the regression, where a AIC 10 was required to include a model in the analysis (a median 1,500, range 379- 4,500 phylogenies per participant met this criterion). Estimated integration dates for each sequence were averaged across all passing phylogenies per participant. Highest posterior density intervals were computed using the R package HDInterval (version 0.2.2). 4.6.8.

Conclusions, Summary and Implications HIV genetic diversity poses an enormou s challenge to our ability to end the pandemic. At the same time however, this extensive diversity can be harnessed to gain novel insights into HIV biology, towards achieving the ultimate dual goals of developing effective strategies for prevention and cure. This \"double edged sword\" aspect of HIV genetic diversity is reflected in the original re search that composes this thesis, and is the reason that the thesis is entitled \" Addressing and Leveraging Between- and Within-Host HIV Genetic Diversity Towards Ending the HIV Pandemic \". Overcoming HIV's extraordi nary population- and individual-level genetic diversity is a key challenge to vaccine design. This has long been known, and the challenges have been outlined time and again, including in a seminal review article by Drs. Brian Gaschen and Bette Korber, titled \" Diversity considerations in HIV-1 vaccine selection \", published 20 years ago 1. Despite nearly 40 years of effort however, we are still a long way from a safe and effective preventive vaccine2. As outlined in this thesis, the selective pressure of the host's immune response plays a major role in driving within- and between-host HIV evolution over time as the virus continually mutates to evade host responses, limiting the host's abilit y to control or eliminate in fection, and cont ributing to ever-increasing HIV diversity. While this thesis specifically focused on the effects of HLA-restricted CD8+ T-cell responses on driving HIV evolution, HIV-specific antibodies similarly rapidly and continually drive evolution within the viral envelope gene, contributing to within-host genetic bottleneck after bottleneck as the host antibody response continually adapts in an effort to keep pace with envelope escape 3. This diversity however can also be leveraged to design vaccine strategies. The 'conserved elements' approach4-6, which capitalizes on known mutational constraints and replicative costs of immune escape in ke y conserved regions, illustrates the most basic way in which knowledge of HIV conservation and diversity can aid immunogen selection. But there are other more detail ed and precise ways that HIV diversity can specifically guide vaccine immunogen select ion. Large-scale statistical studies identifying HLA-associated immune escape pathways and subsequent experimental investigations into the impact of specific polymorphisms on viral fitness can identify sites 179within the viral proteome that are particularly constrained, where mutational escape can only occur at a substantial replicative cost7. Such studies help to identify the mutationally constrained \"Achilles heels\" of the virus with the aim of \"hitting HI V where it hurts\", conferring a benefit to the host7. Towards this goal, chapter 2 of this thesis describes the first statistically rigorous identification of 385 unique HLA-associated polymorphisms in HIV-1 subtypes A1 and D, two understudied subtypes co-circulating in Uganda, providing insight into viral sites under selective pressure in HIV subtypes and host populations where a preventive HIV vaccine is most pressingly needed. Importantly, this work leveraged the genetic diversity between these subtypes to reveal that 34% of HLA- associated mutation pathways differed between them, and further identified specific viral sites that were particularly mutationally constrained in each subtype. This work underscores the extent to which vaccine immunogen selection may need to be tailored if region-specific vaccines were to be pursued. Indeed, immunogen design and selection is critical to vaccine success. The recent failure of two phase 2b/3 vaccine trials in sub- Saharan Africa, HVTN 702 (Uhambo) and HVTN 705 (Imbokodo), to elicit protection against HIV infection underscores the importance of this 8. The immunogen for HVTN 702 was adapted from a subtype B/E design originally tailored to the Thai HIV epidemic in which it was originally tested 9, to HIV subtype C which predominates in Southern Africa8, while the HVTN 705 regimen contained quadrivalent mosaic gag/pol/env immunogens assembled using computational optimization methods to maximize the breadth of HIV sequence diversity covered in potential T-cell epitopes, paired with a clade C-specific env booster 10-12. Despite these major setbacks, another very different example of how the detailed study of within-host immune escape can inform vaccine design has recently shown some success. This is the design of sequentia l immunogens that recapitulate the natural within-host evolution of HIV under antibody selection pressures, with the goal of eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) via vaccination 13, 14. In this approach, immunogens, either based on the natural HIV sequence evolution observed to induce bNAbs in vivo or structurally designed to have an affinity gradient to drive the development of these bNAbs, are sequentially introduced to stimulate affinity maturation of antibodies toward the development of specific bNAbs, thus mimicking the effect HIV evolution can have on bNAb development in vivo 13, 14. Willis et. al. recently describe the development of a priming immunogen engineered for, and capable of, binding the B-cell 180receptor (BCR) of the germ line precursor of the PCT64 and PG9 V2-apex class of bNAbs, as well as the bNAbs themselves15. Moreover, Melzi et. al. demonstrate the ability of this immunogen, whether delivered as a protein or m RNA-Lipid Nanoparticle (mRNA-LNP), to elicit activation, germinal center recruitment and selection of maturation mutations in a humanized-mouse model expressing the germline BCR of PCT64, presenting promising evidence that the study of HIV evolution and genetic diversity can be harnessed towards HIV vaccine development 16. This study also demonstrated enhanced effect when the immunogen was delivered using mRNA-LNP technology, as used in some SARS-CoV-2 vaccines 17, 18, further highlighting the promise and utility of this vaccine delivery technology16. Similar to HIV vaccine development, progress towards an HIV cure is hampered by the challenges posed by HIV genetic diversity. At the most basic level, the field urgently requires accurate, scalable methods to quantify intact reservoir size - both as a basic tool to understand reserv oir biology but also to a ssess the ability of candidate interventions to reduce reservoir size. The impact of HIV diversity on the recently developed Intact Proviral DNA Assay (IPDA) 19, a ddPCR-based intact reservoir quantification assay that is rapidly being adopted in research and clinical studies20, was not fully realized until after the method began to be implemented more widely. Chapter 3 of this thesis describes the first independent characterization of the IPDA assay, revealing that it can fail in up to ~30% of subtype B infections due to between-host HIV polymorphism, and that it can also underestimate reservoir size due to within-host sequence heterogeneity. This work addressed these challenges by first alerting the field to the nature and extent of the issue, and also by developing a secondary probe set to mitigate these challenges as this important assay is applied more and more widely. Indeed, HIV diversity mitigating approaches in the IPDA developed as part of this thesis have since been further implemented to measure intact reservoir size in participants of clinical trials globally, including those with non-subtype B infections 20. This work on the IPDA thus represented an important first st ep towards acknowledging and addressing HIV genetic diversity as a challenge to the development of curative strategies. The within-host HIV reservoir that persists during ART is highly genetically diverse and dynamic, and achieving a deeper understanding of reservoir composition and dynamics is critical to designing effective HIV cure strategies. Chapter 4 of this thesis, which represents the first study to compare the longevity of proviruses with 181varying genomic integrity sampled during long-term ART, clearly demonstrates how the detailed study of within-host HIV evolution can be leveraged to gain key insights into reservoir dynamics. In this study, we used longitudinal HIV sequenc es collected pre-ART to infer a host-specific rate of HIV evolutio n, which we then used to convert the root-to- tip distances of on-ART sampled proviruses to their original integration dates. We found that, while all individuals preserved at least some extremely long-lived proviruses that dated back to the earlier years of infection, these were in all cases defective. Intact proviruses by contrast, which are the most critical to eliminate, typically entered into the reservoir in the year or two prior to ART in itiation. Strikingly however, we also found evidence to suggest that low-level viremia in otherwise well-suppressed individuals may in some cases originate from defective prov iruses, suggesting that defective proviruses may be clinically relevant. By harnessing within-host HIV diversity, this work yielded novel insights into reservoir composition and dynamics, which may in turn advance curative approaches. In conclusion, HIV genetic diversity continues to pose an enormous challenge to the development of strategies to end the HIV pandemic. At the same time however it can be harnessed to yield key insights, as the work in this thesis shows. Nothing perhaps has brought viral diversity as a challenge to pandemic management more keenly to the forefront than the COVID-19 pandemic however. In real-time, the entire world has watched the rapid development of immune escape, its negative implications for both natural and vaccine-induced immunity and the strategies we can take, such as variant-specific or bivalent vaccines 21, to overcome these challenges. The rapid successes seen in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development are built upon decades of incremental increases in understanding of, and successes towards managi ng, other viral pathogens, work from countless scientist across generations. The work described in this thesis demonstrates that steps likewise can be taken to overcome the challenge posed by HIV diversity towards the development of an HIV vaccine and cure, and the ut ility of this diversity to deepening our understanding of HIV biology. In doing so, it has broader implications for our ability to tackle each new pathogen that we face as a society. 182References 1. Gaschen B , et al.

We used droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) to dem- onstrate that human DNA levels, a stable molecular marker of sampling quality, were significantly lower in samples from 40 confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases that yielded negative diagnostic test re sults (ie, suspected false-negative test results) compared with a representative pool of 87 specimens submitted for COVID-19 testing. Our results support suboptimal biolog-ical sampling as a contributor to false-negative COVID-19 test results and underscore the importance of proper training and technique in the collection of nasopharyngeal specimens. Keywords. COVID-19; ddPCR; false negative; nasopha- ryngeal swab; sample quality. Accurate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis is critical to a successful clinical and public health response. Current COVID-19 tests detect 1 or more targets in the se-vere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ribonucleic acid (RNA) genome, usually by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and naso-pharyngeal swabs have been the preferred sample for testing to date [ 1]. Although PCR-based tests are highly sensitive, false-negative COVID-19 test results do occur [ 2, 3], although reported rates vary. A recent large retrospective study esti-mated the clinical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays to be between 58% and 96% [ 4], whereas another reported a 67% SARS-CoV-2 RNA detectability rate in respiratory sam- ples taken within 7 days of hospitalization for COVID-19 [ 5]. Various factors other than molecular technology contribute to test sensitivity, including the timing of sample collection with respect to infection stage [ 6, 7] as well as specimen storage and transport [ 2]. Improper specimen collection could also con- tribute to false-negative COVID-19 test results. Although naso-pharyngeal swabs are routinely ordered for respiratory viruses, the collection of a high-quality specimen requires training and expertise because it involves insertion of the swab to the pos-terior nasopharynx, a depth of approximately 7 cm, followed by rotation and withdrawal of the swab [ 8]. To investigate sub- optimal sample collection as a possible cause of false-negative test results, we quantified human deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) levels recovered on nasopharyngeal swabs submitted to a single laboratory for COVID-19 testing, hypothesizing that human DNA could serve as a stable molecular marker of specimen col-lection quality. METHODS The St. Paul's Hospital Virology laboratory is 1 of 5 provincially designated SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic laboratories in British Columbia, Canada. COVID-19 testing on nasopharyngeal swabs (Copan UTM collection kit or BD universal viral trans-port system) was performed by total nucleic acid extraction from 500 L medium on the Roche MagNA Pure 96 followed by real-time RT-PCR using using the Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 test. Between March and May 2020, we identified 40 suspected false-negative nasopharyngeal swab test results from presumed or confirmed COVID-19 cases for which >1 mL medium re-mained for retesting. These included 23 negative samples from individuals who recorded a positive test within \u00b112 days of the negative test (in which the median time elapsed between nega-tive and positive tests was 4 days, with an interquartile range of 1-6 days) and 17 samples from individuals who tested negative but for whom there was high clinical suspicion of infection by the treating physician with no alternate diagnosis established. A convenience sample of 87 consecutively submitted nasopha-ryngeal swabs served as a comparison dataset. Remnant spe-cimens were stored at 20\u00b0C until retesting. To standardize nucleic acid extraction across all specimens and to maxi-mize viral RNA recovery, 1 mL medium was extracted on the BioM\u00e9rieux EasyMag and eluted in 35 L buffer. SARS-CoV-2 detection in suspect false-negative samples was reattempted using a nested RT-PCR and esearch Contributions The following article was reproduced with rights granted by Oxford University Press via RightsLink (License Number: 5447860186038). \u00a9 Oxford University Press, Kinloch et al. 196900 JID 2020:222 (15 September) BRIEF REPORTconserved regions in open reading frame (ORF)-1a and Spike [10], in which the lower limit of detection of this assay was esti- mated in-house using serial dilutions of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA standards (Exact Diagnostics). Human DNA levels were quantified using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), a technique in which each sample is fraction-ated into 20 000 nL-sized water-in-oil droplets before PCR amplification sequence-specific primers and fluores-cent probes, and in which Poisson statistics are used to cal-culate input template concentrations at reaction endpoint. Nucleic acid extracts were combined with primer/probe sets targeting 2 regions in the human RPP30 gene ~8 kb apart, ddPCR Supermix for Biolabs), and quencher; 3IABkFQ = 3' Iowa Black Fluorescent Quencher). Droplets were generated using an Automated Droplet Generator (BioRad) and cycled at 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes; 40 cycles of (94\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 53\u00b0C for 1 minute) and 98\u00b0C for 10 minutes and analyzed on a QX200 Droplet Reader (BioRad) using QuantaSoft software (version 1.7.4; BioRad). Measured copies of RPP30/reaction are averaged across primer/probe sets, divided by 2 (as each human cell carries 2 RPP30 copies), and normalized to input volume to determine cells/L extract. A convenience panel of 91 remnant nucleic acid extracts per- formed on the Roche MagNA Pure 96 as part of COVID-19 testing was also assessed for human RNAseP RNA levels using the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC) protocol on a Roche Lightcycler 480 [ 11] and human RPP30 DNA levels as described above. This study was approved by the Providence Health Care/ University of British Columbia and Simon Fraser University Research Ethics Boards. RESULTS We began by validating a SARS-CoV-2-nested RT-PCR/sequencing protocol targeting ORF1a and Spike [ 10] on a blinded test panel of 24 SARS-CoV-2-negative and -positive samples extracted on the EasyMag, and confirming 100% concordance with results obtained using the Roche LightMix 2019-nCoV real-time RT-PCR assay (in which positives in the latter assay yielded C t values of 21.5 to 35.4; data not shown). Using synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA standards, we further estimated the in-house lower limit of detection (LLOD) of the nested RT-PCR assay to be ~1.5 copies/re- action (data not shown), which is lower than the reported LLOD of ~10 copies/reaction from the Roche LightMix 2019-nCoV real-time kit package insert. Reasoning that the nested RT-PCR assay might therefore offer increased SARS-CoV-2 detection sensitivity compared with the orig-inal real-time RT-PCR assay, we retested the 40 suspected false-negative specimens by nested RT-PCR. However, all suspect false-negative samples again tested negative. This indicated that the original negative results were not likely attributable to suboptimal real-time RT-PCR assay perfor-mance, but rather suggested that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was ex-ceedingly low or absent in these samples. We then investigated whether human DNA recovered on the nasopharyngeal swab could serve as a molecular marker of specimen collection quality, reasoning that DNA (by virtue of its stability) would be well preserved in remnant clinical specimens. We used a sensitive, multiplexed ddPCR protocol for absolute human RPP30 gene copy number quantification [ 12]. Overall, we observed significantly lower human DNA levels in the suspected false-negative nasopharyngeal swab samples compared with a panel of consecutive samples sub-mitted for testing during the same period, although overlap between groups was still substantial ( P < .001) ( Figure 1 ). Specifically, suspected false-negative specimens harbored a median 3409 (interquartile range [IQR], 1213-4242) human cells/L extract, whereas samples in the comparison group harbored a median 5539 (IQR, 3649-7744) human cells/L. Further stratification of the false-negative samples by type (ie, negative tests from individuals with a confirmed positive test within \u00b112 days, and negative tests from individuals with high clinical suspicion of infection) revealed that both subgroups harbored significantly less human DNA compared with the control group ( P < .001 and P = .006, respectively). This sup- ports suboptimal biological sampling as a contributing cause of false-negative COVID-19 test results. We chose human DNA as a molecular marker of sam- pling quality because of its stability. However, the US-CDC RNA-specific primer/probe set, in part to assess sample quality [ 11]. To investigate the relation- ship between human cells as measured by RPP30 gene copy number using ddPCR, and RNAseP RNA C t values measured by real time RT-PCR, we retrospectively quan-tified both molecules in a convenience panel of 91 rem-nant nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid extracts generated on the Roche MagNA Pure 96. The measurements correl-ated strongly: RNAseP RNA C t values ranged from 19.65 to 27.77, whereas human cells/L extract measured by ddPCR ranged from 82 to 32 498 (median, 1454; IQR, 667-4100) human cells/L extract, yielding a Spearman's 2020:222 (15 September) 901DISCUSSION Our results underscore the importance of proper training and technique in the collection of high-quality nasopharyn-geal specimens. They also highlight the potential utility of including a molecular marker of sampling quality in SARS- CoV-2 diagnostic assays that co uld serve as an endogenous control. Although the major commercial assays (eg, Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2; https://www.fda.gov/media/136049 ) in- clude control for nucleic acid extraction and RT-PCR amplification, these do not provide a measure of biological sampling quality. Although the US-CDC 2019-nCoV real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel does feature a human RNAseP RNA-specific primer/probe set, in part to assess sample quality [ 11], our findings suggest that the interpretation criteria for this control may be too liberal. Specifically, the US-CDC's instructions for use, issued on March 15, 2020, state that failure to detect RNAseP within 40 PCR cycles can indicate insufficient biological material in the sample or other assay problems. In our retrospective test panel of 91 remnant nasopharyngeal nucleic acid extracts, however, the 90th percentile C t value for RNAseP was 25.9 (range 19.65 to 27.77; see Results). The observation that even the lowest decile of samples in terms of RNAseP RNA levels (possibly representing those for which sampling was the least robust) still amplified well before C t <40 suggests that this threshold may be insufficient to identify suboptimally col-lected samples. Some limitations of our study merit mention. Our use of a convenience sample of 87 consecutively submitted nasopharyn-geal swabs may not represent an ideal control group, because there is no guarantee that these samples were collected using appropriate or consistent technique. Indeed, the wide range of human DNA levels observed in this group, and the substantial overlap with the suspected false-negative group, corroborate this notion. However, this limitation should only serve to re- duce our study's statistical power. Moreover, approximately 40% of our suspected false-negative tests derived from patients with high clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection but whose di-agnosis was never confirmed. Because diagnoses may not have been made in a consistent manner across treating physicians, these samples may be less likely to represent false-negative re-sults. However, our observation that human DNA levels in both subcategories of the false-negative group were significantly lower than in the comparison group suggests that this limita-tion may be minimal. It is also important to note that our study was not designed to identify a threshold of human DNA (or RNA) that could define a properly collected SARS-CoV-2 na- sopharyngeal swab. Future studies attempting to do so would need to consider that recovery efficiency (and thus total yield) of different types of nucleic acid may differ by extraction plat-form (eg, human DNA levels recovered in the present study differed between BioM\u00e9rieux and MagNA Pure platforms; see Results), and possibly by swab type. It is also important to note that, although human DNA levels can serve as a surrogate marker of the amount of biological material collected, sampling the correct anatomical location is also critical, particularly for nasopharyngeal swabs. CONCLUSIONS Our observations strongly support suboptimal biological sam-pling, but not PCR sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, as a contributing cause of false-negative COVID-19 test results.

We compared 2 recommended nasopharyngeal swab collection techniques in adult volunteers and found that swab ro- tation following nasopharyngeal contact did not recover additional nucleic acid (as measured by human DNA/RNA copy number). Rotation was also less tolerable for participants. Notably, both discomfort and nucleic acid recovery were significantly higher in Asian participants, consistent with nasal anatomy differences. Our results suggest that it is unnecessary to rotate the swab in place following contact with the nasopharynx and reveal that procedural discomfort levels can differ by ethnicity. Keywords: biological material; COVID-19; ddPCR; ethnicity; nasopharyngeal swab; participant experience; RT-ddPCR; sample quality. Nasopharyngeal swabs are critical for accurate diagnosis of respiratory tract infections including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [ 1, 2]. Specimen collection, which involves inserting a long flexible swab through the nostril along the floor of the nasal cavity to a depth of ~7 cm and into the nasopharynx, must be performed by a trained he alth care professional familiar with the technique and nasal anatomy [ 1]. There is, however, no consensus for optimal swab collection. Following contact with the nasopharynx, the World Health Organization, for example, recommends that the swab be left in place for a few seconds be-fore withdrawal [ 3], while the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that the swab be \"gently rubbed and rolled\" and left in place for several seconds before withdrawal [ 4]. Other guidance documents recommend that the swab be rotated in place before removal [ 5-8]. Given that swab insertion/removal is invasive and uncomfortable [ 1, 9], a better understanding of the impact of postinsertion collection techniques on sample quality and patient experience may refine collection methods. We recruited adult volunteers to undergo a nasopharyngeal swab with or without rotation and to provide saliva, an alter- native COVID-19 diagnostic specimen [ 10-12 ], as a compar- ator. Participants rated their discomfort during the swab on an 11-point scale [ 13] and were asked which specimen, swab or saliva, was less unpleasant to give. We assessed nucleic acid re-covery as a marker of swab collection quality [ 2], where human RPP30 [ 2] and human RNase P copy numbers were used as sur- rogates for DNA and RNA recovery, respectively. METHODS We recruited 69 participants over 3 days in July 2020. For safety reasons, participation was restricted to individuals without symptoms of COVID-19 or other respiratory illnesses, and participants were assumed to be COVID-19 negative. A single experienced health care provider collected all nasopharyn-geal swabs using the Puritan UniTranz-RT transport system (Puritan Medical Products). Due to the potential for mild trauma incurred by the procedure, each participant underwent only 1 swab. To do this, participants were assigned to 1 of the 2 swab collection techniques at study entry, though they were blinded to the specific technique until immediately before the procedure. Before collection, the provider instructed partici-pants to alternatingly apply pressure to each nasal ala to iden-tify the less congested nostril. The provider estimated the depth to the participant's posterior nasopharynx by he Creative Commons Attribution- non- commercial-NoDerivative 4.0 International Public License. 2002 alexternally from the nasal ala to tragus and viewed the nasal pas- sage to check for mucus and obstructions (if mucus was vis-ible, the participant was instructed to blow their nose [ 1]). With the participant's head tilted back slightly, the provider gently inserted the swab into the identified nostril along the lateral aspect of the nasal cavity floor and into the nasopharynx. For half the participants, the swab was removed after reaching the nasopharynx (\"in-out\" swab). For the remaining participants, the swab was rotated in place for 10 seconds following place-ment in the nasopharynx (\"rotation\" swab) and then removed. Swabs were immediately placed in transport medium. To help evaluate participant experience in providing samples for diag-nostic purposes, participants were also asked to provide ~2 mL of saliva into a sterile container (Starplex Scientific) by focusing on pooling saliva and gently expelling it into the container, re- peating until the required volume was achieved. Participants were asked to rate their discomfort during the swab on an 11-point scale [ 13], where \"0\" denoted a complete absence of discomfort and \"10\" denoted the most severe discomfort pos-sible. Finally, participants were offered the hypothetical choice of providing saliva or undergoing a nasopharyngeal swab for a diagnostic purpose and asked: Purely based on your experience today , which sample would you prefer to give and why? Swabs were processed within 5 hours of collection. Total nu- cleic acids were extracted from 1 mL of medium on a NucliSens easyMAG (BioM\u00e9rieux) and eluted in 60 L. Eluates were split into 3 aliquots and frozen at -80\u00b0C until use. Droplet digital pol-ymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) ddPCR were used to quantify human RPP30 copy numbers and RNase P transcript numbers, respectively. In this technology, each sample is fractionated into 20 000-nL-sized water-in-oil droplets before amplification with sequence-specific primers and fluorescent probes, and input template concentrations are calculated at the end point using Poisson statistics. The RPP30 assay, described previously, yields a final measurement of cells/L extract [ 2]. In the RNase P assay, nucleic acid ex- tracts were combined with CDC-developed RNAseP-specific primer/probe set [ 14], and the One-Step RT-ddPCR Advanced Kit for Probes (BioRad). Primer and probe are as follows: Forward Primer-AGATTTGGACCTGCGAGCG, Reverse Primer-GAGCGGCTGTCTCCACAAGT, Probe-FAM- ZEN quencher; 3IABkFQ = 3' Iowa Black Quencher). Droplets were generated using an Automated Droplet Generator (BioRad) and cycled at 50\u00b0C for 60 minutes, 40 cycles of (94\u00b0C for 30 seconds and 55\u00b0C for 1 minute), and 98\u00b0C for 10 minutes and analyzed on a QX200 Droplet Reader using QuantaSoft software, version 1.7.4 (BioRad). Measured RNase P copies were normalized to input volume to determine RNase P copies/L extract. RNase P levels were also assessed using real-time RT-PCR with the same primer/probe set on a Roche Lightcycler 480 according to the CDC protocol [ 15]. All 3 assays were performed on in- dependent extract aliquots to avoid freeze-thaw. All ddPCR and RT-ddPCR assays were performed in duplicate, and results were averaged between replicates. Nonparametric statistics were used for all correlations and between-group comparisons. Contingency tables were analyzed using Fisher's exact test. Lin's concordance coefficient was used to calculate concordance be- tween replicates. As the purpose of this study was to evaluate nasopharyngeal swab collection techniques, human DNA/RNA was not quantified in saliva samples. Patient Consent Statement This study was approved by the Providence Health Care/ University of British Columbia and Simon Fraser University Research Ethics Boards. All participants provided written in-formed consent. RESULTS The median age of the 69 participants (interquartile range [IQR]) was 42 (36-54) years; 43 (62%) were 44 (64%) White, 21 (30%) Asian (in-cluding 14 East, 1 Central, 3 South, and 3 Southeast), and 4 (6%) other (including 2 Latino and 2 mixed ethnicity). For 5 (7.2%) participants, the nasopharyngeal swab was unsuccessful due to obstruction despite attempts through both nares, leaving 64 (34 \"in-out\" and 30 \"rotation\") swabs for analysis. Discomfort scores ranged from 1 (minimal discomfort) to 10 (maximum discomfort) in both swab groups, with no significant differ-ence between them (median [IQR], 5 [3.75-5] for \"in-out\" vs 4.5 [4-6] for \"rotation\"; P = .51) ( Figure 1A ). This suggests that most of the discomfort occurs during swab insertion/with-drawal, a notion that is supported by the significantly higher discomfort reported by participants with occlusions ( P < .001) ( Figure 1B ). However, responses to additional study questions suggested that swab rotation was less tolerable. First, though most participants preferred giving saliva, 10 of 34 (29.4%) par-ticipants in the \"in-out\" group preferred the swab, vs only 3 of 30 (10%) participants in the \"rotation\" group (Fisher exact test P = .068) ( Figure 1C ), citing that the swab was easier, faster, and/or generally less unpleasant than giving saliva. Moreover, 2 participants in the \"rotation\" group mentioned that they had previously undergone an \"in-out\" swab and that the additional rotation made the procedure more uncomfortable. One added that, given the choice between \"in-out\" swab and saliva, they preferred the swab, but given the choice between \"rotation\" swab and saliva, they preferred saliva. Discomfort scores did not differ by sex ( P = .85) or age (Spearman's = 0.05; P = .7). Of note, however, Asian participants reported significantly higher discomfort scores compared with White participants (median [IQR], 5 [4-7] vs 4 [3.5-5], RNase P (RNA) copy numbers were measured as surrogates of nucleic acid recovery. Concordance between replicates was both 0.98; = 0.91; P < .0001), and measurements of both targets correlated strongly with one another (Spearman's = 0.84; P < .0001). Both RPP30 and RNase levels varied markedly regardless of swab tech- nique: RPP30 levels extended over a 42-fold 1751 cells/L extract) ( Figure 2A ), while RNase P levels extended over a 20-fold range (from 183 to 3570 copies/L extract) ( Figure 2B ). Moreover, we significant dif- ferences in levels by swab technique for .83) 2A P = .84) ( Figure 2B ). Together, this indicates that swab rotation does not recover more nucleic acid and suggests that the amount of cellular material recovered is participant-specific. Indeed, when stratified by ethnicity, nucleic acid recovery was signif-icantly higher in Asians, who reported on average higher dis-comfort levels (see Figure 1D ). Specifically, the median vs 431 (223-621) cells/L vs ( = .026) ( Figure 2C ), while (1167-2095) vs 1193 (531-1758) RNase P copies/L extract groups (P = .038) ( Figure 2D ). No significant differences in RPP30 or RNase P levels were observed by sex, age, or recruitment date (a surrogate of nucleic acid extraction run). RNAse P levels were also measured using the CDC 2019-nCoV real-time RT-PCR diagnostic assay [ 15]. The resulting cycle threshold (Ct) values correlated strongly with those measured using RT-ddPCR (Spearman's = -0.9; P < .0001) and yielded results entirely consistent with those described above (data not shown).\"In-Out\" n = 34\"Rotation\" n = 30 \"In-Out\" \"Rotation\"Successful swab n = 64Occlusion n = 5 White n = 41Asian n = 20012345678910Discomfort scoreP = .51 P < .001 020406080100Percentage of participants Preferred swab Preferred saliva P = .047 P = .068A C012345678910Discomfort scoreB 012345678910Discomfort scoreD Figure 1. Differences in participant experience by nasopharyngeal swab technique and ethnicity. A, No difference in discomfort score bet ween \"in-out\" (black circles) and \"rotation\" (white circles) swab groups was observed. B, Signicantly higher discomfort was reported in participants with oc clusion (gray squares) compared with those with a successful swab (black and white circles, denoting the groups described in (A). C, A greater proportion of \"rotation\" sw ab participants preferred to give saliva com- pared with \"in-out\" swab participants. D, Signicantly higher discomfort scores were reported in Asian compared with White part icipants. Individuals of other ethnicities were excluded due to low numbers (n = 4).\u000e observations have the potential to improve nasopharyngeal sample collection. For 7.2% of individuals, nasopharyngeal sam-pling was not possible due to obstructions (eg, nasal polyps or deviated septum), and the procedure caused significantly more discomfort in these individuals. Providers should be aware of the frequency and discomfort implications of such occlusions and should be issued appropriate guidance (eg, do not force swab; sample \"midturbinate\" area of the nasal cavity if the na-sopharynx cannot be reached and note the swab location). Our observations further indicated that, despite being widely re-commended, swab rotation upon contact with the nasopharynx does not enhance nucleic acid recovery and is less tolerable. We speculate that swab saturation is essentially achieved during entry and very brief resting in the nasopharynx, such that rota-tion does not recover additional material. As we followed guid- ance to remove excess mucus before swabbing (as it can reduce the collection of desired cellular material [ 16]), our results are unlikely attributable to mucus collection. By extension, our re- sults further suggest that, while sometimes recommended [ 8], swabbing both nares is an unnecessary practice. The marked spread in discomfort scores was also notable. Though the average score in our study (5 on an 11-point scale) is similar to previous reports for nasopharyngeal swabs (an average of 3 on a 6-point scale [ 9]), the variation in discomfort levels from minimal to extreme underscores the need for providers to be mindful of interindividual dif-ferences in experience. Intriguingly, Asian participants re-ported on average 1-point greater discomfort than White participants. This may be related to differences in the shape, contour, and/or size of the nasal cavities and nasopharynx. Indeed, after adjustment for weight, age, and sex, a study of facial anthropometric differences by ethnicity reported sig-nificantly lower nasal volumes (measured at 0-4 cm from the nostril), lower mean cross-sectional nasal area (at 0-6 cm), and longer distances to the minimal cross-sectional area in 0200400600800100012001400160018002000Cells/ L extract Cells/ L extractP = .83 P = .84 0200400600800100012001400160018002000P = .026 P = .03805001000150020002500300035004000RNase P copies/ L extract RNase P copies/ L extract 05001000150020002500300035004000AB C D\"In-Out\" n = 34\"Rotation\" n = 30\"In-Out\" n = 34\"Rotation\" n = 30 White n = 41Asian n = 20White n = 41Asian n = 20 Figure 2. Differences in nucleic acid recovery by nasopharyngeal swab technique and ethnicity. A and B, No difference in DNA (RPP30, cel ls/L extract (A)) or RNA re- covery (RNase P , RNase P copies/L extract (B)) between \"in-out\" (black circles) and \"rotation\" (white circles) swab techni que groups was observed. C and D, Signicantly higher levels of DNA (RPP30, cells/L extract (C)) and RNA (RNase P , RNase P copies/L extract (D)) were recovered on swabs fro m Asian compared with White participants. Individuals of other ethnicities were excluded due to low numbers (n = 4).\u000e with White individuals [ 17], differences that could affect individual experience during the procedure. Our recovery of higher levels of nucleic acid on swabs from Asian participants is also consistent with narrower nasal pas- sages in this group compared with White individuals [ 17]. Specifically, narrower nasal passages could increase both swab discomfort and mucosal contact, though marked varia-tion in nucleic acid recovery across all ethnicities was noted. Nevertheless, health care providers should be sensitive to dif-ferences in discomfort levels across diverse populations. Some limitations of our study merit mention. We assume that total human DNA/RNA targets are appropriate markers of respiratory pathogen collection quality [ 2], which is consistent with the inclusion of RNase P in the CDC 2019-nCoV real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel as part of quality control [ 15]. While respiratory epithelial cells, which are the targets of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens, exhibit a unique transcrip-tional profile that could facilitate their selective quantification [ 18], these cells are estimated to represent 85% of all human cells in this anatomical region [ 18], suggesting that the majority of human DNA/RNA quantified here is derived from this most relevant cell type. As swabs vary in design, the absolute discom-fort scores and nucleic acid quantities recovered may not be ap-plicable to all swabs, though our general observations should be. Protocol differences also prevent direct comparison of re- covered nucleic acid across studies (eg, the swab, silica input during nucleic acid extraction, and elution volumes differed be-tween the present and a previous study by our group [ 2]). CONCLUSIONS When performing nasopharyngeal sampling, rotation of the swab upon contact with the nasopharynx does not enhance sample quality. Swab rotation also increases the procedure duration, which represents an additional disadvantage in the context of mass screening. The observation that procedural dis-comfort levels differ significantly by ethnicity underscores the need for care providers to be sensitive to such differences and more broadly underscores the importance of diverse participant representation in health research. Review and standardization of nasopharyngeal swab collection guidance notes should be a priority in the current COVID-19 pandemic.

They hold similar potential to advance COVID-19 control and prevention, but SARS-CoV-2 viral load tests are not yet widely available. SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic tests, which typically employ real-time RT-PCR, yield semiquantitative results only. Droplet digital RT-PCR for SARS- CoV-2 RNA real-time RT-PCR ebased SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests were evaluated for use in RT-ddPCR; three were identi ed as the most efcient, precise, and sensitive for RT-ddPCR ebased SARS-CoV-2 RNA quanti set was preci- sion, as the coef cient of variation, was approximately 2% at 1000 input copies/reaction. Lower limits of quanti cation and detection for this primer/probe set were 18.6 and 4.4 input SARS- CoV-2 RNA copies/reaction, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral loads in a convenience panel of 48COVID-19 epositive diagnostic specimens spanned a 6.2log 10range, con RT-ddPCR ederived SARS-CoV-2 Egene copy numbers were further calibrated against cycle threshold values from a commercial real-time RT-PCR diagnostic platform. This log-linear rela-tionship can be used to mathematically derive SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy numbers from cycle threshold values, allowing the wealth of available diagnostic test data to be harnessed to address foundational questions in have revolutionized our ability to manage viral diseases.1e6Although not yet widely available for SARS-CoV-2, quantitative assays could advance our understanding of COVID-19 biology and inform infection prevention and control measures.7,8Most SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic assays, however, which use real-time RT-PCR to detect one or more SARS-CoV-2 genomic targets using sequence-speci c primers coupled with a fluorescent probe, are only semiquantitative. These tests produce cycle threshold (C t) values as readouts, which represent the PCR cycle where the sample began to produce fluorescent signal above background. Although each C t value decrement corresponds to a roughly twofold higher viral load (due to the exponential nature of PCR ampli - cation), C tvalues cannot be directly interpreted viral loads without calibration to a quantita- tive standard.9,10Rather, C tvalues are interpreted as posi- tive, indeterminate, or negative based on assay-speci c cutoffs and evolving clinical guidelines. Due to differences in nucleic acid extraction method, viral target, and other parameters, C tvalues are also not directly comparable across assays or technology platforms.

In ddPCR, however, each reaction is fractionated into 20,000 nL esized droplets prior to massively parallel PCR ampli cation. At end point, each droplet is categorized as positive (target present) or negative (target absent), allowing for absolute target quanti cation using Poisson statistics.

Furthermore, no studies to our knowledge have calibrated SARS-CoV-2 viral loads to diagnostic test C tvalues. Here, eight SARS-CoV- 2especic primer/probe sets, originally developed for real- time RT-PCR,27are evaluated for use in RT-ddPCR. The authors also derive a linear equation relating RT- ddPCRederived SARS-CoV-2 viral loads and real-time RT-PCR ederived C SARS-CoV (COVID19) E-gene assay, allowing conversion of existing COVID-19diagnostic results to viral loads.

SARS-CoV-2 Synthetic RNA Standards RT-ddPCR assays were evaluated using commercial syn- thetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA standards comprising six nonoverlapping 5000-base fragments quantities encoding the 2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank Twist Biosciences, San Francisco, CA; supplied at approximately 1 million copies/fragment/ mL). To avoid degradation, RNA standards were stored at /C080/C14C and thawed only once, immediately before use, to perform the analytical efciency, precision, analytical sensitivity, and dynamic range analyses described herein. Moreover, to mimic nucleic acid composition of a real biological specimen, all assays employing these standards were supplemented with a consistent, physiologically relevant amount of nucleicacid extracted from pooled remnant SARS-CoV- 2enegative nasopharyngeal swabs ( Supplemental Figure S1 ). Brie fly, 1-mL aliquots of pooled viral trans- port medium were extracted on the NucliSens EasyMag (BioMerieux, Marcy-l 'Etoile, France), eluted in 60 mLa n d repooled. The resulting material contained DNA from on average 2200 human cells/ mL (as quanti ed using human RPP30 DNA copy numbers by ddPCR as described in33) and 4400 human RNAse P copies/ mL extract (as quanti ed by RT-ddPCR as described in34), concentrations that are in line with human DNA and RNA levels recovered on nasopharyngeal swabs.33,34 RT-ddPCR for SARS-CoV-2 Quanti cation RT-ddPCR reactions were performed combining relevant SARS-CoV-2 RNA template with target-speci c primers and probe (900 nmol/L and 250 nmol/L, respectively; In- tegrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) ( Table 1 ), One- Step RT-ddPCR Advanced Kit for Probes Supermix, Reverse Transcriptase, and DTT (300 nmol/L) (all from CA), restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), background nucleic acid (for reactions employing synthetic RNA template only, see above), and nuclease free water. Droplets were generated using an Automated Droplet Generator (BioRad) and cycledunder primer/probe set especic conditions (see below) (Figure 1 ). Analysis was performed on a QX200 Droplet Reader (BioRad) using QuantaSoft software version 1.7.4 (BioRad) where replicate wells were merged prior to analysis. Thermal Cycling Temperature Optimization For each primer/probe set, acceptable thermal cycling tem- perature ranges for reverse transcription and PCR annealing/ Figure 1 Thermal cycling optimization.

Positive droplets ( blue ) are above the threshold ( pink line ); negative droplets ( gray ) are below the line. Colored boxes below each well indicate whether results met standards for inclusion ( green ) or not ( red)(Materials and set.RT-ddPCR SARS-CoV-2 RNA cation The Journal -jmdjournal.org 909 208extension were determined by modifying the manufacturer- recommended default conditions, which are 42/C14Ct o5 0/C14C for 1 hour (for reverse transcription); 95/C14C for 10 minutes; 40 cycles of (94/C14C for 30 seconds followed by 50/C14Ct o 63/C14C for 1 minute); 98/C14C for 10 minutes, and 4/C14Ci nnite hold. To determine acceptable temperature ranges for reverse transcription, a thermal gradient from 42/C14Ct o 51.5/C14C was performed while xing the annealing/extension step at 52/C14C. Using the optimized reverse transcription temperature, a thermal gradient from 50/C14Ct o6 3/C14C was then performed to identify acceptable annealing/extension tem- perature ranges. Temperatures that produced insuf cient separation of positive from negative droplets or nonspeci c ampli cation were deemed unacceptable, as were those that produced consecutive 95% con dence intervals (CIs) of copy number estimates outside those of the maximal point estimate. Analytical Ef ciency and Precision The analytical ciency of set to quan- tify SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-ddPCR was determined using synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA standards at 1000 and 100 input copies. A minimum of three (maximum four) technical replicates were performed at each concentration, where results were expressed as the point estimate with 95% total Poisson CI derived from merged replicates. As such, primer/probe sets that yield nonoverlapping 95% total Poisson CIs around the point estimate can be considered signicantly different from one another. Analytical ef - ciency was calculated by dividing the measured SARS- CoV-2 copy number by the expected input copy number and multiplying by 100. Precision was expressed as the coef - cient of variation (CV), expressed as a percentage, across technical replicates. Linear Dynamic Range The linear dynamic range (LDR) of each primer/probe set of interest was determined across a serial 1:2 dilution series from 114,286 to 1.2 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/reaction. This range of concentrations was chosen because it crosses the entire range of recommended input copies for a ddPCR reaction seeking to quantify the target of interest (see the manufacturer 's protocol). Reactions were performed in duplicate. The upper limit of quanti cation and lower limit of quanti cation (LLOQ) were de ned as the upper and lower boundaries of the concentration range over which the relationship between measured and input SARS-CoV-2RNA copies was linear. The determination was made by iteratively restricting the range of concentrations included in the linear regression of measured versus input SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies to identify the ones which maximized the co-efcient of determination ( R 2) value and minimized the residuals. Assay Analytical Sensitivity Assay analytical sensitivity, de ned as the lower limit of detection (LLOD), was determined for primer/probe sets of interest by serially diluting synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA standards to between 47.6 and 0.74 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/reaction. Between 6 and 18 technical replicates were performed for each dilution, and results were analyzed using probit regression. The LLOD, determined through interpo- lation of the probit curve, was de ned as the concentration of input SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a reaction where the prob- ability of detection was 95%. SARS-CoV-2 RNA Quanti cation in Biological Specimens, and Relationship to C tValue Optimized RT-ddPCR assays were applied to a conve- nience sample of 48 consecutive remnant SARS-CoV- 2epositive diagnostic nasopharyngeal swab specimens that were originally submitted to the St. Paul 'sH o s p i t a l Virology Laboratory in Vancouver, Canada for diagnostic testing using the Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay. For these samples, total nucleic acids were re-extracted from 250 mL of remnant medium using the BioMerieux NucliSens EasyMag and eluted in 50 mL. Eluates were aliquoted and frozen at /C080/C14C prior to single use. SARS- CoV-2 copy numbers were quanti ed by RT-ddPCR as described above. As the main goal was to characterize the relationship between C tvalues and SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels without confounding by extraction platform, quan- tity of input material, or SARS-CoV-2 genomic target, these extracts were re-tested using a commercial real-time RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic (TIB Molbiol, Berlin, Germany), implemented on LightCycler 480 (Roche Di- agnostics, Basel, Switzerland).35Finally, to be responsive to a recent recommendation that SARS-CoV-2 viral loads be reported in terms of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies per human cell equivalents,9human cells/microliter of extract were measured by ddPCR as previously described33and additionally results reported as SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/ 1000 human cells.Table 2 Acceptable Thermal Cycling Temperature Ranges for Primer/Probe Sets Assessed in of Molecular Diagnostics 209Statistical Analysis SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy numbers were expressed as point estimates with 95% total P oisson CIs derived from merged replicates, calcula ted using QuantaSoft software version 1.7.4 (Bio-Rad). Ass ay precision was reported as the CV, expressed as a perce ntage, across technical rep- licates. Assay linear dynamic range was determined by identifying the range of concentr ations that maximized the coefcient of determination ( R2) and minimized the re- siduals in the relationship between measured and input SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies. Assay LLOD was determined by probit regression. Correlation between SARS-CoV-2 RNA gene copies meas ured using different primer/probe sets was determined by Spearman 'sr h o( r). Where it was appropriate to measure concordance, Lin 's concordance correlation coef cient ( rc) was calculated. The relation- ship between SARS-CoV-2 viral load as measured by RT- ddPCR and diagnostic test C tvalue was evaluated usinglinear regression. Statistical anal yses were performed using GraphPad Prism software version 8 (GraphPadSoftware, San Diego, CA) or Microsoft Excel software version 14.7.2 (Micro soft, Redmond, WA) with P<0.05 considered statistically signi cant. Results Thermal Cycling Optimization for SARS-CoV-2 Quanti cation by RT-ddPCR Eight primer/probe sets originally developed for SARS-CoV- 2 diagnostic testing by real-time RT-PCR were evaluated for use in RT-ddPCR ( Table 1 ). Because these primer/probe sets vary in sequence, amplicon length, and SARS-CoV-2 genomic target, the acceptable temperature ranges were rst determined for reverse transcription and PCR annealing/ extension. Most primer/probe sets were tolerant of a wide temperature range, and background signal was essentially Figure 2 Analytical ef ciency and precision of primer/probe sets.

The E-Sarbeco primer/probe set, for example, produced consistent amplitude proles, copy number estimates, and essentially zero back- ground at annealing/extension temperatures ranging from 50/C14Ct o6 3/C14C(Figure 1 A) (data not shown). The over a 50/C14Ct o6 positive and negative droplet separation was insuf cient at higher temperatures (Figure 1 B). Acceptable temperature ranges for each primer/ probe set are shown in Table 2 . All subsequent experiments were performed at reverse transcription 42.7/C14C and anneal- ing/extension 50.9/C14C except those for HKU-ORF and US- CDC-N1, which were performed at reverse transcription 45.7/C14C and annealing/extension 55.1/C14C, based on initial, more subjective assessments of RT-ddPCR plot quality. Analytical Ef ciency and Precision quanti ca- tion for each primer/probe set, calculated as the percentage of input viral RNA copies detected by the assay, was next evaluated. Precision, calculated as the dispersion of measured copies around the mean (CV), was also evaluated. Analytical ef ciency and precision were evaluated at 1000 and 100 SARS-CoV-2 RNA target input copies. At 1000 input copies, primer/probe set analytical ef ciency ranged from 83% (E-Sarbeco) to 15% (US-CDC-N1) ( 2 A). At 100 copies, the analytical ef ciency hierarchy was identical, with values ranging from 74% (E-Sarbeco) to 12% (US-CDC-N1). Of all primer/probe sets evaluated, the E- Sarbeco, IP2, and IP4 sets had the highest analytical ef - ciencies by a substantial margin. At 1000 and 100 target copies, E-Sarbeco analytical ef ciency analytical ciency the China-ORF primer/probe set was only 46% and 39% at 1000 and 100 input copies, respec- tively, and the analytical ef ciencies of the remaining sets were<30% regardless of input copy number. Furthermore, while measurement precision generally decreased at the lower template concentration, 36the E-Sarbeco, IP2, and IP4 primer/probe sets were nevertheless among the most precise, with CVs of <5% at 1000 input copies and <15% at 100input copies ( Figure 2 B). Combined analytical ef ciency and precision data con rmed E-Sarbeco, RT-ddPCR ( Figure 2 , C and D), so these were moved forward for further characterization. Reduced Analytical Ef ciency When IP2 and IP4 Are Duplexed in were originally designed for duplexing in real-time RT-PCR,29the authors evaluated them in duplex for RT-ddPCR. Duplexing, however, decreased analytical ef ciency, from 70% to 52% (at 1000 input copies) and 55% to 37% (at 100 input copies) for IP2, and from 69% to 49% (at 1000 input copies) and 59% to 38% (at 100 input copies) for IP4 ( Supplemental Figure S2 A). Duplexing also decreased precision ( Supplemental Figure S2 B). For IP2, CV increased from 5% to 11% when duplexing at 1000 input copies, and from 15% to 25% when duplexing at 100 input copies. For IP4, CV increasedfrom 4% to 7% (1000 input copies) and 14% to 21% (100 input copies) with duplexing. Duplexing of these re- actions is therefore not recommended in RT-ddPCR, and all IP2 and IP4 assays were performed as single reactions. LDR and Limits of Quanti cation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-ddPCR Droplet achieve absolute target copy number quanti cation without a standard curve. To and IP4 assays, the authors set up 18 twofold serial dilutions of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA beginning at 114,286 copies/ reaction (this copy number is obtained when 120,000 copies are added to a 21- mL reaction, of which 20 mL is used for droplet generation) and ending with 2.32 copies/reaction. This input copy number range crosses nearly the entire manufacturer-recommended template input range for ddPCR reactions seeking to quantify the target of interest, which is 1 to 100,000 copies/reaction (see the manufac- turer 's protocol). The LDR of each assay was determined by iteratively restricting the range of concentrations included in the linear regression of measured versus input SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies to identify the range that maximized the R2value and minimized the residuals. For E-Sarbeco, the regression spanning 18.6 to 114,286 input SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies Figure 3 Linear dynamic range dilutions of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA standards ranging from 114,286 to 2.32 copies/reaction (shown as log 10values), using the E-Sarbeco primer/probe set.

Restricting the linear regression to this range also minimizedthe residuals of all included data points to /C60.065log 10 copies/reaction ( Figure 3 A). The IP2 assay, although less efcient than E-Sarbeco, had the same estimated LDR of 18.6 to 114,286 input copies/reaction ( Figure 3 B). This produced an R2value of and residuals within /C60.065log 10copies/reaction across ( Figure 3 B). The LDR of IP4 was estimated as 37.2 to 114,286 input copies/reaction, an approximately 3000-fold range, which yielded an R2Z0.9975 and produced residuals within /C60.11log 10copies/reaction across this range ( Figure 3 C). For all three assays, 114,286 input copies/reaction should be considered a conservative estimate of the upper limit of quanti cation, because saturation of the RT-ddPCR reaction or loss of linearity was still not achieved at this concentration. LLOD of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-ddPCR The authors next determined the analysis applied to serial dilutions of synthetic SARS-CoV- 2 RNA standards revealed the E-Sarbeco RT-ddPCR assay to be the most analytically sensitive of the three, which is consistent with it also having the highest analytical ef - ciency. Speci cally, the estimated CI, 2.4-5.7) SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/ reaction ( Figure 4 A). The estimated LLOD of the IP2 assay was 7.8 (95% CI, 4.4-10.3) SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/re- action ( Figure 4 B), whereas that of IP4 was 12.6 (95% CI, 6.9-16.5) SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies per reaction (Figure 4 C). SARS-CoV-2 Viral Loads in Biological Samples SARS-CoV-2 viral loads were measured in 48 con rmed SARS-CoV-2 epositive samples using the E-Sarbeco, IP2, and IP4 primer/probe sets (note that samples with original diagnostic test C tvalues <19 required RNA extracts to be diluted up to 1:200 prior to quanti cation to ensure that input copies measurements fell within each assay 's LDR). The results revealed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA in these bio- logical samples varied over a 6.2 log 10range ( Figure 5 A). Average copy numbers measured using the E-Sarbeco assay (which targets the Egene) were higher than those using the IP2 and IP4 assays (which target ORF1a and ORF1b , respectively) ( Figure 5 A). This is consistent with assay analytical ef ciency ( Figure 2 ) and in vivo coronavirus RNA expression patterns, where transcripts covering the 30 end of the genome are more abundant than those covering the 50end.37e40Speci cally, the median Egene copy number was 5.1 [interquartile range (IQR), 3.9 to 5.7] log 10 copies/ mL extract compared with a median of 4.9 (IQR, 3.9 Figure 4 Lower limit of detection (LLOD) of (%) in 1:2 in serial dilutions of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA from 47.6 to 0.74 in put copies/reaction using the E-Sarbeco primer/probe set is analyzed using probit regression ( solid black line ;dashed line denotes the 95% CI).

C:Same as A, but for the IP4 primer/probe set.Kinloch et al 914 jmdjournal.org -The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics 213to 5.5) log 10copies/ mL extract for the IP2 target, and a median of 4.9 (IQR, 3.9 to 5.6) log 10copies/ mL extract for the IP4 target. SARS-CoV-2 Egene, IP2, and IP4 copy numbers in samples correlated strongly with one another (Spearman 'sr>0.99; P<0.0001 for all pairwise analyses) ( Figure 5 ,BeD). Consistent with comparable ORF1a andORF1b RNA transcript levels in vivo ,37,38,40IP2 and IP4 copy numbers were D). Based on a recent recom- mendation,9the authors also report their results in terms of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies per human cell equivalents: re- sults for E-Sarbeco spanned a sevenfold range from 1.05 to 7.3 log 10SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/1000 human cells, with IP2 and IP4 log 10copy numbers lower, as expected (Supplemental Figure S3 A). The Spearman 's correlationbetween absolute and human cell enormalized viral loads was strong ( P<0.0001) ( Supplemental Figure S3 B), which is consistent with the assumption that the amount of bio- logical material collected by nasopharyngeal swabs is rela- tively consistent. Inferring SARS-CoV-2 Viral Loads from Diagnostic C t Values Finally, the relationship between C tvalues produced by a commercial COVID-19 diagnostic platform and SARS- CoV-2 RNA copy numbers was characterized. The LightMix 2019-nCoV real-time Molbiol), implemented a LightCycler 480 (Roche Diagnostics) because commercial diagnostic reagents comprising the E-Sarbeco primer/probe Figure 5 Log 10SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads in diagnostic specimens.

D:Spearman 's r) and Lin 's correlation ( rc) The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics -jmdjournal.org 915 214set exist for this platform28and because it takes puri ed nucleic acids as input, thereby allowing direct comparison of results from the same starting material (real-time RT-PCR platforms that take biological material as input are subop- timal for such a comparison because the onboard extraction introduces an additional variable). Because the C tvalues reported for the LightMix assay are based on a 9- mL extract input volume in the authors 'laboratory,35their primary analysis reported RT-ddPCR results in terms of SARS- CoV-2 copies equivalent (ie, SARS-CoV-2 copies in 9 mL of extract), to allow direct conversion of C tvalues to ab- solute viral copy numbers. Sample C tvalues ranged from 11.34 to 31.18 [median 18.69 (IQR, 16.73 to 22.69)] using LightMix assay. The relationship between C tvalue and SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy numbers was log-linear, with an R2Z0.9990 (Figure 6 ). Despite this strong r elationship, inspection of the residuals nevertheless su ggested modest departures from log-linearity at the extremes of the linear range (Supplemental Figure S4 ). The relationship between C t value and absolute SARS-CoV-2 Egene copies can thus be g i v e nb yl o g 10 SARS-CoV-2 E gene copies equivalent Z/C00.3038 C t\u00fe11.7 ( Figure 6 ). That is, a C t value of 20 corresponds t o 453,942 (ie, 5.66 log 10)S A R S -CoV-2 RNA copies, whereas a C tvalue of 30 corresponds to 416 (ie, 2.62 log 10) viral copies. This equation also predicts that the C tvalues corresponding to the LLOQ and LLOD of the E-Sarbeco assays are 34.8 and 36.84, respectively. When measured SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy numbers are expressed as human cell enormalized viral loads, the relationship with the C tvalue is given by log10 SARS-CoV-2 ). An extract that yielded a C tvalue of 20, therefore, is estimated to have contained 48 ,978 (ie, 4.69 log 10) SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/1000 human cells, whereas one with a C t value of 30 is estimated to have contained 45 (ie, 1.66log 10) copies/1000 human cells. Discussion Although real-time and droplet digital RT-PCR both employ target-speci c primers coupled with fluorescence-based amplicon detection, there are key differences in reaction chemistry (eg, RT-ddPCR reagents must be compatible with water-in-oil droplet (eg, whereas fluorescent quenchers, ddPCR typically uses dark quenchers). As a result, assays developed for one platform may not always translate seamlessly to the other. For example, ddPCR probes should ideally not have a guanine at their 50end because this quenches the fluorescence signal even following hydrolysis (see the manufacturer 's protocol), but the HKU-N probe has a G at its 50end ( Table 1 ). It is perhaps therefore not surprising that the overall performance of the eight primer/probe sets in RT-ddPCR did not exactly mirror that in RT-PCR.41,42 Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 RNA quanti by RT-ddPCR, ef cient in real-time RT-PCR.41,42The authors 'results also con rm previous reports of the E- Sarbeco primer/probe set performing well in RT- ddPCR.11,23Other primer/probe sets, however, notably US CDC-N1, HKU-ORF, and China-ORF, did not perform as well in the authors 'RT-ddPCR assay compared with a previous report.11One key difference is that, whereas the authors used sequence-speci c reverse transcription (with the reverse primer) in a one-step RT-ddPCR reaction, the previous study featured an indepen- dent reverse transcription reaction primed with random hexamers and oligo dT dwhich can yield higher ef - ciency than sequence-speci cp r i m i n g 36,43e45dto generate cDNA for input into a ddPCR reaction. This is therst study to evaluate IP2 or IP4 primer/probe sets in RT-ddPCR. The analytical sensitivities of the RT-ddPCR assays re- ported here are nevertheless comparable to existing esti- mates. The limit of detection of the BioRad SARS-CoV-2 Figure 6 Relationship between SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies equivalent and diagnostic test cycle threshold (C t) value. C tvalue, determined using the LightMix 2019-nCoV real-time 10SARS-CoV-2 Egene RNA copies equivalent, which represents the number of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies measured by droplet digital RT-PCR(RT-ddPCR) in 9 mL of extract (the template volume in the LightMix assay). The linear regression ( solid black line ) transitions to a dashed line below the LLOQ.Kinloch et al 916 jmdjournal.org -The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics 215ddPCR Kit, for example, is estimated at 150 copies/mL (manufacturer 's protocol), which is comparable to the au- thors 'E-Sarbeco RT-ddPCR the TargetingOne 19 digital PCR assay the set23were reported at 10 copies/test and 5 copies/reaction, respectively, both comparable to the LLOD determined here. Although a number of studies have reported that RT-ddPCR can detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in low viral load clinical samples with higher sensitivity than real-time RT-PCR,12,21,22,24e26the current study was not designed to evaluate this. The esti- mated LLOD of 4.4 copies/reaction by RT-ddPCR using the E-Sarbeco primer/probe set ( Figure 4 ) is in fact comparable to the LLOD reported by the manufacturers for many real- time RT-PCR ebased COVID-19 diagnostic assays,46 though it is important to note that these lower limits are theoretical. In practice, various factors impact assay ef - ciency, most notably the presence of PCR inhibitors in biological samples that are not removed by the extraction process,47as well as the ef ciency of the extraction process itself. In theory, the sample partitioning and end-point measurement used in ddPCR should make this technology more robust to small quantities of inhibitors than real-time PCR technologies that rely on initial detection of fluores- cent signal above background (48e51and the manufacturer 's protocol), though all platforms will be affected by nucleic acid extraction ef ciency. The ability to quantify SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in biological samples can advance our understanding of COVID-19 biology, and RT-ddPCR offers an attractive platform.7,8The observation that, in a small convenience sample, both absolute and human cell enormalized9 SARS-CoV-2 loads spanned more tha na6l o g 10range conrms an enormous viral load range in vivo52and suggests that some of the high viral load samples measured here were from individuals with early and progressive infection24,53e55or who were experiencing severe disease,7,8though clinical information was un- known. The ability to quantify SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in biological samples dparticularly when these are normalized to the amount of human biological material collected (as nasopharyngeal swabs, eg, are stored invariable amounts of viral transp ort medium, making it difcult to standardize viral copy numbers volumetrically across studies, laboratories, and over time) dopens numerous opportunities to advance our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 biology. Accurate viral load measurements for example can enhance our u nderstanding of the impact of emerging SARS-CoV-2 sequence variants on trans- missibility and virulence, and provide a powerful tool to evaluate the ability of novel therapeutic candidates to suppress viral replication, and by extension transmission. Furthermore, the authors 'equation relating C tvalues derived from a commercial diagnostic assay and SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy number means that existing diag- nostic test results can be converted to viral loads without re-testing samples. Although calibration of viral load measurements against all real-time RT-PCR platforms is beyond the authors 'scope, this is achievable and in some cases data may already be available.24 Some limitations merit mention. Only eight commonly used SARS-CoV-2 especi c primer/probe sets were tested, and others may exist that adapt well to RT-ddPCR. The authors 'assay performance estima tes should be considered approximate, bec ause the manufacturer- reported concentration of t he synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA standards used in this study may vary by up to 20% error (Twist Bioscience, personal communication). Moreover, the authors solely evaluated a one-step RT-ddPCR protocol, and there fore assay performance estimates will likely differ from protocols that feature independent cDNA generation followed by ddPCR. The upper boundary of the linear dynamic range of the E-Sarbeco, IP2, and IP4 RT-ddPCR assays could not be precisely de ned because linearity was maintained at the maximum input of 114,286 target copies/reaction, which already exceeds the manufacturer 's estimated upper range of quanti cation in a ddPCR reaction (manufacturer pro- tocol). Our convenience panel of 48 SARS-CoV- 2epositive diagnostic specimens also likely did not cap- ture the full range of biolog ical variation in viral loads, though data from larger cohorts52suggests that it was reasonably comprehensive. The a uthors also acknowledge that there is measurement uncert ainty with real-time RT-PCR C tvalues that may subtly tionship between C tvalue and RT-ddPCR ederived SARS-CoV-2 viral load described here. Importantly, however, measuring quantita tive viral loads enables an objective evaluation of the RT-PCR C tvalue cutoffs used to distinguish positive, indeterminate, and negative resultsdthresholds that can vary across assays and labo- ratories. Finally, the authors 'estimates of assay perfor- mance may not completely re flect those of the entire diagnostic process, because the nucleic acid extraction step introduces additional inef ciencies. In conclusion, primer/probe sets used in real-time RT- PCRebased COVID-19 diagnostic tests can be migrated to RT-ddPCR to achieve SARS-CoV-2 RNA quanti ca- tion with varying analytical ef ciency, precision, and sensitivity. Of the primer/probe sets tested, the E-Sar- beco, IP2, and IP4 sets performed best, where LLOQ and LLOD estimates for the E-Sarbeco assay (18.6 ectively) indicated real-time sensitivity. Mathematical inference of SARS-CoV-2 copy numbersfrom COVID-19 diagnostic test C tvalues, made possible via the type of calibration performed in the present study, will allow the wealth of existing diagnostic test data to be harnessed to answer found ational questions in SARS- CoV-2 biology.RT-ddPCR RNA Journal of Molecular Diagnostics -jmdjournal.org 917 216Supplemental Data Supplemental material for this article can be found at http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmoldx.2021.04.014 .
