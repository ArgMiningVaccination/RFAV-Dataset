Every day in the United States about 93 tons of industrial waste is pumped into the air we breathe, and over 160 contaminants (including rocket fuel, arsenic, and pesticides) can be found in our nation's tap water. The Natural Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIH) confirms over 90% of human exposure to dioxins is through food. Dioxins are found in both industrial and environmental processes. Through absorption and storage in fat tissue, dioxins enter our food chain.

This hard-working herb plays a dual role in dog detox by (1) fortifying the liver against toxins and (2) nourishing the cellular process that repairs liver cells and promotes the regeneration of new cells. Milk thistle is well known among medical herbalists to reverse liver damage and protect against alcohol damage. Dandelion Root is Hepatic (an effective liver tonic according to Herbal Medical texts): it acts to detoxify the liver. Cholagogue: it decongests the gallbladder by increasing bile flow. Choleretic: it acts to promote bile production. Anti-rheumatic: it stimulates cell metabolism in the body, helping the body to dump metabolic waste into the blood to be cleansed by the kidneys. Dandelion has been used as a dog detox and as a diuretic to increase urine and eliminate excess bodily fluid. Burdock Root, essential to an effective dog detox, has been used by traditional healers to assist the kidneys in purifying the blood by removing toxins that can build up in blood. Its abundant antioxidants are helpful in protecting the liver from toxic chemicals, allowing it to process the body's naturally occurring steroids which are helpful in achieving hormonal balance. A mild bitter, Burdock root soothes the GI tract and stimulates the gallbladder, releasing digestive juices and secreting bile to aid in appetite and digestion. Black Walnut Hull (from the Black Walnut Tree - Juglans nigra) has been used for centuries by Native Americans as a remedy to guard against invading microorganisms and parasites. Constituents include juglone, tannin and iodine -- three powerful agents that, according to Native American healers, kill harmful microorganisms, clear up yeast and fungal infections, and destroy over 100 different types of parasite. Uva ursi (Bearberry) is best known among herbal medical practitioners for its ability to cleanse, heal and fortify the kidneys, bladder and urinary tract from end to end. For two thousand years natural healers have used the herb to treat nephritis, kidney stones, chronic cystitis, and as a general tonic for under-performing kidneys, liver and pancreas. Tannins in the leaves of uva ursi lower the acidity of urine, reducing the risk of uric acid buildup that leads to kidney stones, and relieving joint pain due to crystallization. Oregano is an anti-fungal, for both internal fungal infections and external conditions. It is an anti-parasitic that kills internal worms and parasites, relieving irritations such as flea-allergic dermatitis. This antioxidant prevents cell damage caused by free radicals, slows down aging and helps protect from certain cancers, macular degeneration, osteoarthritis and rheumatism. Oregano is anti-allergenic and acts to desensitize a dog or cat's involuntary allergic reaction to environmental toxins.
