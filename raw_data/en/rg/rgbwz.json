While exposure can likely lead to illness, our lifestyle also plays a huge role in whether or not we stay consistently healthy. Our immune system is a vital part of our health, as well as our body being able to function optimally. Here's what you need to know about chiropractic care and your immune system. WHAT IS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM'S JOB? The main job of our immune system is to fight and protect against infectious organisms and block them from entering our bodies. Our immune system is made up of proteins, cells (white blood cells), tissues, and organs and all of these components work together to keep us healthy. CHIROPRACTIC TREATMENT When most people think of chiropractic treatments, they imagine patients suffering from back or neck pain. Chiropractic care certainly helps with those issues but can benefit your health in many ways. Regular chiropractic adjustments improve the overall health and wellness of patients, including the immune system. The spine is part of the central nervous system, which is how the brain and body communicate. When it is functioning optimally, the rest of the body systems will, too - and that includes the immune system. When the spine is misaligned, it can throw the body's entire communication system out of whack, resulting in a non-responsive system. The experienced chiropractors at Shields Chiropractic are trained to remove subluxations from the spine which interfere with communication. We use a variety of adjustments and treatments to ensure your nervous system is free of interruption, so your body can perform at its best.
