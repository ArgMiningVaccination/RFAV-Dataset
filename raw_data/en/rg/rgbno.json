With the law of jungle prevailing, there was undoub- tedly the survival ofthefittest and therefore, man must have been always concerned about hishealth. Having thus originated with man himself, it islong before any recorded history when history began tobewritten in the different centres ofcivilisation, medicine was already tosome extent developed. These records aremuch earlier than the discovery ofpaper 8 and appear engra- vings instone, inEgypt and leaves inIndia Some other features ofmedical drugs ofthose days are discovered from archaeological finds. Examination of well preserved mummies also show the types of illnessess aswell aswhat was done forthem. Inhisearliest days asman could explain theexistence ofdisease, therefore, there was allthe emphasis onthesupernatural. offirst habitation ofman, medicine grew uparound thebelief that the world swarmed with evil spirits which plague the living creatures with disease. Sickness was always asscciated with theevil eye, casting ofaspell, the curse, or some form ofblack magic. Appropriate measures had tobetaken todrive out demon orevil spirit orpropitiate theGods. Medicine, therefore remain the property ofMagic Man, Sorcerer and the Priest for very long time. This persisted through every civilisa- tion toavery late day, varying only indegree according tothe scientific development inthedifferent regions. Such practices were 'ages. There was thewell known Witch's Cauldron. Itsbrew made from snakes, herbs etc. was alleged tocure anything from abarren womb toagirls' lack ofsuitorsl The Sorcerer was also afamiliar sight with his prescriptions like \"Adder'sBul!.

Transference ofdemons orevil spirits ofdisease tobirds oranimals by chanting certain hymns was another practice. The Witch Doctors have been the subject ofmuch comment and more credit isbeing given tothem now than previously. Their cures arenow being put to\"faith-healing\", and \"auto-suggestion\" and they areeven credited asbeing psycho-analysts long before thenames ofFreud, Adler and Jung. Practically everyone allover the world has some sort ofsuperstition though itmay vary indegree between the more educated and scientific people compared totheothers notso advanced.

The earliest known medical writing isthe Sume- rianclav-tablets (2100 B.C.) which give prescriptions formany remedies.

Temples were erected to him as earlier to Imhotep inEgypt and in these Aesculapieia, asthey arecalled, patients prayed slept and sup- posedly got cured intheir sleep orat times received instructions Aes- culapius intheir dream visions. The advent ofHippocrates (460361 B.C.) marked the beginning ofthe real departure from theancient archaic medicine and of the dawn ofthe scientific era inmedicine inGreece. He, along with Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, embarked on the quest of knowledge and succeeded inbreaking the barrier ofignorance, superstition, witchcraft, spell and charms. One of the outstanding contributions of Hippocrates that brought him to glory was that hestudied patients and not diseases, thus foreshadowing \"Lndiv iduelis stion', afeature special method of\"clinical observa- tion\". He emphasised the role of charac- teristics ofman. inhealth and dise- treatise on \"Air, Waters and Places\" was studied inmedical schools for nearly tv,enty centuries. Itwas his great wisdom that hecon- sidered dise ase tobeadeviation from the normal slate, and not an entity. 18 like Ayurvedic physicians he has mentioned both the Law remedy and the disease condition is removed through remedies which produce similar symptoms tothe disease\". Also, \"incertain cases a teverish state can becured identical those that amplified as,\"By similar administered tothesick they arehea- ledoftheir disease.

Unfortunately, himself being anoriginal thinker and inspite ofhismany and great achie- vements, hestifled thought and thus brought medicine toavir- tual standstill formore than fifteen centuries that his theories were in dominance. His purpose was to organise medicine sorigidly that his work would suffice forelltimes In hisTheory ofHumors heshowed more than truth and made ofthe Greeks and theSimilia for his prescriptions compounded and later Greco- Roman influence on world medical thought covered the mille- nnium from 500 B.C. to500 A.D. The next millennium, between 500 AD and 1500 may becharacterized asthemedieval period ofmedicine- atime ofgreat strife, progression. These have been called theDark Ages ofMedicine. During this time, one ofthe forces toengage was theimpact ofArabic science. As inother spheres, political conquests have often develop- ment Nise ofmedicine also andduring thisperiod Arabs freely translated and imbibed the knowledge ofmedical science from allthese places and added toitthe contributions oftheir own scinentists and inthis form the Greek medical system returned toWestern culture. Inthis period, two men particularly stand out -Rhazes and Avicenna. Rbezes (850-930 AD) aGalenist, but inpractice he seemed tohave been guided more by the principles ofHippocrates. He insisted that treatment offever be being Avicenna (910-1037 A.D.)isknown asthe Persian Galen. More than are attributed tohim, the most important ofwhich isthe very voluminous codex, Canon Medicinae. This was used inthefamous medical universities right tillthe19th century. Asforsuperstition, itisstill believed that suffering pilgrims kneeling athis brick tomb atHamadan (Iran) can getthemselves cured. Both ofthese writers also saved much ofthelore that came from India and which they incorporated intheir own writings. They have frequently quoted from Sushruta, Charaka and Vagbhata, astheir books had been translated into Persian and the8thcentury. \"Islamic medicine and science\" of the Hellenic sun. when itsday had fled, and they shone like amoon illuminating the darkest night ofthe European middle ages.

Man's intellect was mortgaged totheautho- rity ofthe Church and few, ifany, could burnt hiswritings upheld Hippocratic teaching and conceived ofthe chemical theory of diseases and drugs asagainst the then prevailing humoral and vitalistic theories. Of historical significance to Homoeopaths isthat not only refutes Galen's contra riaprinciple butemphasises \"when similar is put tosimilar and used and appl ied with intelligence then nature isserved well\". From hisasset- homoeopathic law ofhealing \"similia similibus curentar\". but also three other principles which are peculiar to homoeopathy -individualization of patient, diagnosis interms oflike remedy and minimum enable pium vitae\", notable who undercut the foundation stone ofinfallibility from beneath Galen, medieval medicine's idol, was Andreas Vesalius (1514-1564), Professor at Padua. Byhuman dissection and direct observation hewas able to prove Galen's conceptions started byMondins in1315 at Bologna and followed by Guy de Cheutiec atMontpellier but Galen's authority was sostrong that hiserrors in1660; Leeuwenhoek was first tosee \"animalcules\" -protozoa and bacteria, Albrecht procedures and Morton started anaes- thesia in1842 and enabled the advances insurgery. Darwin published origin ofspecies in1859; Roentgen (1845-1923) in1898. VanBehring (1854-1917), the father ofVaccine Therapy has acknowledged his debt toHomoeo- pathy and the similarity between the two. This isanimpressive list and these men have greatly contributed tothe forthe\"triumphant march ofmecha- nical conceptions inphysiology\". In further development of medicine there has been pursuit ofthe site of disease insmaller and smaller entities. When medicine decided tobreak away from philosophy and tobecome science, itnaturally turned tothese ofbotany and zoology. The main credited with suggesting such classification of disease isSvdenbem (1624-1689). Some people before and anumber of 22 them after him followed the same pattern. Itwould be pointless to name all. One outstanding work of this time isthe'Nosologia Methodica' bySanvages in1763. Another Sydenham asadefinite clinical entity grafted on the host, something of which thehost was tobepurged. There was thus ashift intheemphasis from changes intissues and organs, which were tobethecause of disease inthe era dominated by Morgagni (1682-1771). The restricted view was held that disease isalocal disorder. Bichat founded Histology asasocial aggregate\". These studies led more and more into mechanical mode ofthought and the concept ofdisease aslocal disorder still prevailed. Inrecent times withBull. Ind.lnst. Hist. Vol.XX great technological advances research has pressed oninto thecell, into the nucleus, into the structure ofDNA and sotoday they look fortheseat of disease inthemolecules and even at sub-molecular level. Idea ofdisease which hascome todominate medicine isalaboratory study defined in chemical and cellular terms unrelated tosymptoms. Hehnemenn's (1755- 1843) concept that tissue changes (pathology) aretheeffects ofdisease and not the cause; and disease isa constitutional disorder and notmerely local, although having local or peripheral manifestations, has not been generally accepted by the orthodox dominant school. He conceived ofdisease initsdeeper implication and wider perspective as abiological phenomenon of\"altered life\" (biological concept). Robert Koch (1843-1910) and Louis Pasteur(1822-1895) established the microbes asacause ofdisease and thus emphasis was once again shifted from thehost tothe environ- ment, from intrinsic to extrinsic factors. The treatment therefore, was aimed toadverse environmental stimuli was consequently ignored with excessive preoccupation with germs and later viruses (external factors ofcausation ofdisease). Therefore, oftheevilspirits and demons ofearlier times that attack thebody and have tobegotridoff. This has caused lotofsuffering and brought about alop-sided development of medicine, pushing the individual to the background, and this, inspite of the \"Internal milien 'of Claude kill aregiment of soldiers\" with impunity. Inthis list also one may vainly look for apharmacotherapist although their work hasenriched our knowledge ofdisease and helped in preventive medicine and sanitary measures.

This should have laid into itsgrave the theory ofbad humors and bad blood indisease which had tobe drained out. The fact ofLouis XIII having been bled 47times inone year sounds stranger than fiction. In fact subsequent historians (allopaths) have putitthat Hahnemann's succes- ses were but bystopping 'the popular murder- ous practices' permitting the system to naturally recover -vis medicatrix naturae.

President, General Medical Council ofGreat Britain has said \"M\"n used toberegarded asgreater than the sum of his parts, awhole human baing inhealth and disease and his reactions tohis environment were not overlooked. But as the twen- tieth century advanced, the torrent of scientific discovery rushed on so impetuously that itall but engulfad the humanism and hisorgans, tissues, cells and secretions subjected tointensive study Unless basic medical training be directed tothe study ofthewhole man inrelation But this received scant atten- tion till Hahnemann discovered the therapeutic law ofHomoeopathy and the 'provinqs' on healthy humans thus enabling consideration ofman's emotions, his mind and hisbody as asingle interreacting unity. This con- cept isonly beginning tobeperceived bythe other school but still not Reform inthe treatment ofthe Insane: Hahnernann held that lunatics were mentally diseased individuals that deserve sympathy and treatment and not 'possessed' bysomething that had tobedriven out bytorture. Therefore, with Pinel, the treatment of?n insane Duke gave impetus tohis views. Today the picture isentirely changed but the convulsive shock therapy isa partial reminder ofthose procedures. Chemistry: Hshnsrnanns contribution to chemistry has been soconsiderable that ithJS been conceded even by his opponents that ifhe had not engendered so much opposition by founding the system ofHornoe opathv hewould have been acknowledged asagreat chemist.27 byhisconception of disease with emphasis on host's reaction rather than on micro-orga- nisms gave us totackle new similia principle. This was conceived inAyurveda asalso by Hippocrates and fairly forcefully expressed byParacelsus and sugges- ted bysome others but noone elabo- rated and systematised itand used itasagoverning principle inprescri- bing. The main thing that others lacked was the 'provinqs'. Hahne- mann has also been granted aspe- cial place asone ofthose who carried out human-experiments on himself, his family, friends and students. A few names stand out before him who did self experimentation tofind out properties ofdrugs. ShenNung may befirst and itissaid that Perece Isus preferred medicines he had tried on himselt. However, the first man definite lvknown to have tested druqs onhimself isthe Zurich doctor. Conrad Gessner (1516-1565). He mostly experimented with plants. Albrecht von Haller recommended this procedure but mostly forhiswork 28 inphysiology. Another person of note was theViennese Hahnemann, asaformer Vienna student, may have got t\"eidea from him. John Hunter advised Jenner \"Why think, why not trytheexperiment\" and followed this advice himself byinoculating onthis chest thepus from apatient suffering from gonorrhoea. As healso had syphilis, Hunter developed achancre which now bears his name. There was also anisolated experiment of William Alexander in1767. when he took camphor tothestage ofconvul- sions. Purkinje (1787-1869), who made numerous how he has converted tothe \"cult\" ofpharma- coloqical self experimentation by Samuel Hahnemann, of Hornoecp.nhv and alreadv aknown and respected chemist\". In the subsequent two centuries many other persons have carried out self experi- mentation and itiseven mentioned that \"the sable\". \"AsforHahnemann aself- experiment in1790 with Cinchona bark was the starting point for formulating the principle ofsirnilia. As aresult ofhisobservations with this first experiment, oftreatment 19th century i.e. medical world has inmany ways accepted Hahnemann's Sirnilia, Simplex and even Minimum. Now- here isthis more apparent than inthe practice ofallergy and vaccine what term could wemore apptooriatelv speakof the influence excited byasimilar SirWilliam Osler, thescientific study ofdisease. Itis distressing that somany good men live isolated inameasure tram the great body ofthe profession The grievous Hahnemann's teachings have acted and arestill distintegrating, dissolving, remoulding and recons- tructing traditional ideas, customs and methods. Atnoother period has medical science, inreality, coma so near tothe fundamental ideas of Homoeopathy asitdoes today. Itmay beargued byhisopponents that such changes would have occured in time anyway buthonour always goes totheman who originates anidea or aconcept. The tremendous contributions of this great man are ofeverlasting benefit tohumanity. Thus humanity owes aneverlasting debt 3. (1961) land) N.V. 6.
