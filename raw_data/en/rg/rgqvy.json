If Council is consti tuted by that date, the first Council m eeting after the election will be December 9. Some members may serve shorter terms due to the lack of constitution, and some have not been able to commence their terms. By -Law amendments would be necessary to extend terms. However, any extensions should be done for public, and not personal interest. 10. COVID- 19 ACTIVITY LOG Ms. Zeng provided an overview of COVID -19 acti vities. Staff are continuing to operate remotely. A survey will soon be sent to staff and Council to determine whether in- person work may commence, or if remote work policies should be developed. The website is frequently updated, and stakeholders are being kept informed via email , announcements and social media posts . The College is also assisting public health units in communicating vaccination information. In response to members practising vir tually and the need for infection control, the QAC has adopt ed a new comprehensive practice guideline. This is currently undergoing consultation. 11. COLLEGE PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK a) Competency requirements At its previ ous meeting, the Executive Committee asked staff to conduct research on how other colleges have created a competency framework. Mr. Cassman provided an overview of the research, noting that colleges that have implemented competency are doing so within the election process. Some have member nominations with a screening process, or a separate elections committee to determine if candidates meet the criteria to run in elect ions. An overview was provided of the research, along with examples provided by HPRO. Th e College would have to determine how to use and adapt the templates, and decide w hat competencies are mandatory or optional. Examples were also provided of the College of Kinesiologists ' model, as well as those of the College of Nurses, the College of Dental Hygienists of Ontario and the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario. Further research will be conducted to determine how different colleges will implemen t the process . From there, staff will develop draft competencies to present to Council. Open Meeting of the Executive Committee College of Traditional Chinese Medic ine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of Ontario June 22, 20 21 Page 6 The recommendation was also made for the creation of a working group to establish competencies . This would apply to both professional and public members. There was agreement on the need for a framework to ensure Council members ' qualifications. The Executive Committee will discuss this matter during its next meeting. 12. LEGISLATIVE UPDATE a) Governance Reform Ms. Zeng referred Council mem bers to a memo from the Assista nt Deput y Minister of the Ministry of Health which outlines the opportunit ies for governance reform under the RHPA, with a goal of increasing college efficiency. As a reply is expected by June 30, a draft response was shared with the Executive Comm ittee and the members of the Council prior to the meet ing to obtain support and feedback b) Bill 28 3 On April 27, 2021, the government introduced Bill 283, the Advancing Oversight and Planning in Ontario Health Systems Ac t. The Bill will enact the Health and Suppor tive Care Providers Oversight Authority Act , 2021, which would create a new oversight authority to oversee personal support workers, and, possibly other professions in the future. The Bill will also amend the Medicine Act , 1991, to regulate phy sician ass istants under the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario. The Psychology Act, 19 91 will now be replaced with the Psycho logy and Applied Behav iour Analysis Act , 2021. This will change the name of the College of Psychologists of Ontario to t he Colle ge of Psychologists and Behaviour Analysts of Ontario, and regulate the profession of behaviour analysis under that college. Ms. Allison He nry joined the meeting at 10:59 a.m. Ms. Henry presented on Bill 283 and the CPMF. Highlights of the presentation: An outline was provided of Bill 283's four main schedules, one of which is the creation of a new oversight authority to regulate personal support worker s. Similarities between the Oversight Authority and the Regulated Health Professions Act are its use of a Board of Directors and CEO, as well as establishing education and skill -based qualifications for individuals seeking to be registrants with the author ity. Open Meeting of the Executive Committee College of Traditional Chinese Medic ine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of Ontario June 22, 20 21 Page 7 The differences are no exclusive scopes of practice or titles, even though visual ma rks or identifiers will be created for the exclusive use for registrants. An exclusive scope and titles are not f easibl e due to the broad nature of the personal supp ort worker profession, with its multiple roles, different skill sets, and diverse qualifica tions. A code of ethics will also be established, which will establish unbecoming conduct for the profession. There will also be registration processes, and the obligation to maintain a public register of information about registrants. The Authority will also include a complaints process which involves investigation and disciplinary processes . Registration to the Authority is voluntary, with the long- term view of making it mandatory. As personal support workers are the backbone of work in long term car e, requiring registration and competencies at this time could disrupt the workforce. In response to an inquiry on whether there were plans to move the College to the new Authori ty or the new model, Ms. Henry confirmed their focus is on the personal suppor t workers only. No decision or plan has been made for other professions in the workforce, whether regulated or unregulated. CPMF The CPMF was developed to provide standardized reporting across the health colleges, in the aim of helping colleges improve their regulation. It consists of several measurement domains which cover a variety of performance requirements. The Ministry is not currently asses sing the colleges, but is focused on collecting data and information. There is also a goal of ensuring accoun tability between the colleges and the Ministry, to ensure stronger public trust and confidence. Along with Bill 283 , CPMF is about modernization and continuous improvement . Its goal is to help colleges p erform at a high manner in order to insti ll public confidence and trust . Ontario is the first province in Canada to develop this performance framework , which was based on international best practices and subject matter experts in regulatory performance and measurement . A working group of Ontario citizens also contributed. It is expected that there may be challenges in the implementation. T he first reporting cycle will be observed, with the framework's measures refined. A summary report will be provided on the College website. Council competencies have been identified as one of the major gaps in the CPMF. The Ministry is interested in competency -based appointments and can serve as a partner to collaborate with colleges. Some of that work may come out of the Oversight Authorit y, as its board of directors will be appointed based on competency. In response to queries about the appointment of public members, Ms. Henry emphasized Open Meeting of the Executive Committee College of Traditional Chinese Medic ine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of Ontario June 22, 20 21 Page 8 that the PAS is aware of the need for additional members. PAS' role was def ined as a government body which functions independently, even as it partners with the MOH. The College was invited to continue to contact the PAS, and Ms. Henry offered to be the College's advocate in this matter. Ms. Henry left the meeting at 11:52 a.m. As per a Council member's request, an invitation will be sent to the PAS to see whether they would be available to speak with the Council at the next Council/open EC meeting . Council members provided feedback on the draft response to the Assistant Deputy Minister . The Executive Committee with the support of Council members agreed the letter should be sent. MOTION : M. Cha - R. Dong THAT the Executive Committee of the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of Ontario approve the draft letter to the Assistant Deputy Minister as presented.

Technology: I was able to access the material on the Cloud easily. Webex Meetings and other communication devices worked well. 7 8. Any further comments? It was well done. Would be even better to include the material for general meeting. If any additional information to be discussed, better to be clear to indicate which part/page of the meeting package is related. This is not a complaint. Just minor suggestions. I am satisfied with the meeting and appreciate for the hard work of registrar and staff. Thank you. N/A The chai r kept her microphone on when others were speaking most of the time. We still have people using speakerphones, and that is very disruptive and poor quality. We need a chat moderator appointed to each meeting, and someone to police the 'you left your microphone on' situations. I was doing it because no one else seemed to be on top of it. I would prefer if staff were to do it instead of another member.

APPENDIX A DRAFT Independent Auditor's Report To the Members of Council of Colle ge of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of Ontario OpinionWe have audited the financial statements of Colle ge of Traditional Chinese Medi cine Practitioners and Acupuncturi sts of Ontario (the \"Colle ge\"), which comprise the statement of financial position as at M arch 31, 2021, and the statements o f operations, chan ges in net assets and cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies . In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present f airly, in all material respect s, the financial position of the College as at March 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Canadian accountin g standards for not-for-profit or ganizations. Basis for OpinionWe conducted our audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditin g standards. Our responsibilities under those standards are further describe d in the Auditor's Responsibiliti es for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Colle ge in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Canada, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accord ance with these requirements . We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.Other InformationManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon, in the annual report.Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the othe r information and we will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our r esponsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is mat erially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.The annual repor t is expected to be made available to us after the date of our a uditor's report. If, based on the work we will perform on this other information, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of thi s other information, we are required to report that fact to those charged with governance.Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial StatementsManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presenta tion of the financial state ments in accordance with Canadian accountin g standards for not-for-profit or ganizations, and for such interna l control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.In preparing the financial statements, management is responsibl e for assessing the ability of the Colle ge to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Colle ge or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the College. 1DRAFT Independent Auditor's Report (continued) Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an au ditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an au dit conducted in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it e xists. Misstatements can a rise from fraud or error and are considered material if, i ndividually or in the aggregate, t hey could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.As part of an audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditin g standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis f or our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misst atement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may invol ve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control of the Colle ge. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and t he reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the goi ng concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Colle ge to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a materia l uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financialstatements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify ou r opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. Howev er, future events or conditions may cause the Colle ge to cease to continue as a going concern. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying trans actions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, am ong other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relati onships and other matters tha t may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

Financial Instruments (i) Measurement of financial instruments The College initially measures its financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value adjusted by, in the case of a financial instrument that will not be meas ured subsequently at fair value, the amount of transaction costs directly attributable to the instrument. The College subsequently measures its financial assets and fina ncial liabilities at amortized cost. Amortized cost is the amount at which a financial asset or fina ncial liability is measured at initial recognition minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumul ative amortization of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount, and minus any reduction for impairment. Financial assets and liabilities measured at amorti zed cost include cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities.(ii) ImpairmentFinancial assets measured at amortized cost are tested for impa irment when there are indicators of possible impairment. When a significant adverse change has occu rred during the period in the expected timing or amount of future cash flows from the financial asset or group of assets, a write-down is recognized in net income. The write down reflects the difference between the carrying amount and the higher of: - the present value of the cash flows expected to be generated b y the asset or group of assets; - the amount that could be realized by selling the assets or group of assets;When the events occurring after the impairment confirm that a reversal is necessary, the reversal is recognized in net income up to the amount of the previously recognized impairment. The amount of the reversal is recognized in income in the period that the reversal occurs. 8Draft Statements Subject to RevisionCOLLEGE OF TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE PRACTITIONERS AND ACUPUNCTURISTS OF ONTARIO NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2021 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) Capital Assets The costs of capital assets are capitalized upon meeting the cr iteria for recognition as capital assets, otherwise, costs are expensed as incurred. The cost of capital assets comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable cost of preparing the asset for its intended use . Capital assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortizati on and accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is provided for, upon the commencement of the utilization of the assets, using methods and rates designed to amortize the cost of the capital assets over their estimated usefullives. The annual amortization rates and methods are as follows: Furniture and equipment - straight line over 5 yearsComputer equipment - straight line over 3 yearsComputer software - straight line over 3 years Customized computer software - straight line over 10 yearsLeasehold improvements - over the term of the lease Capital assets are tested for impairment whenever events or cha nges in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. If any potential impairment is identified, theamount of the impairment is quantified by comparing the carryin g value of the capital assets to its fair value. Any impairment of capital assets is recognized in i ncome in the year in which the impairment occurs. An impairment loss is not reversed if the fa ir value of the capital assets subsequently increases. There were no impairment indicators in 2021. Deferred Lease Inducements Deferred lease inducements are amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the premiselease. Revenue Recognition The College's principal source of revenue is membership dues wh ich are recognized as revenue in the period to which the membership dues relate. Membership dues received in the current year, applicable to a subsequent year are recorded as deferred revenue on the Statement of FinancialPosition and will be accounted for as revenue in the year to which they pertain. Other fees and revenue include a pplication fees, examination fe es, course fees and interest. Fees are recognized as revenue when the services and courses have be en provided. Interest is recorded when earned. Fees received in the current year, applicable to a subsequent year are recorded as deferred revenue on the Statement of Financial Position and wil l be accounted for as revenue in the year to which they pertain. 9Draft Statements Subject to RevisionCOLLEGE OF TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE PRACTITIONERS AND ACUPUNCTURISTS OF ONTARIO NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2021 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) Use of Estimates The preparation of the College's financial statements in confor mity with Canadian accounting standards for not-for-profit organizations requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liab ilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year.Key areas where management has made difficult, complex or subje ctive judgments include allowance for doubtful accounts and useful lives of capital assets. Actual results could differ from these and other estimates, the impact of which would be recorded in future affected periods. 2. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT RISK MANAGEMENT The College is exposed to various risks through its financial i nstruments. The following analysis provides a measure of the College's risk exposure at the statement of financial position date. The financial instruments of the College and the nature of the risks to which those instruments may be subject, are as follows: Risks Market risk Financial instrument Credit Liquidity Currency Interest rate Other price Cash X Accounts receivable X Accounts payable and accrued liabilities X Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrumen t will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation. The Coll ege is exposed to credit risk on its cash and accounts receivable. The College reduces its exposure to the credit risk of cash by maintaining balances with a Canadian financial institution.The College mitigates its exposure to the credit risk of accoun ts receivable by monitoring receivable balances on a regular basis and providing for receiv ables that are uncollectible. Management has included a provision for doubtful accounts recei vable in these financial statements (see note 3). Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the College will encounter diff iculty in meeting obligations associated with financial liab ilities. The College is exposed to this risk mainly in respect of its accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The College expects to meet these obligations as they come due by generating sufficient cash flow from operations. 10Draft Statements Subject to RevisionCOLLEGE OF TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE PRACTITIONERS AND ACUPUNCTURISTS OF ONTARIO NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2021 2. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) Market Risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk:currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk. The College is not exposed to significantcurrency, interest rate or other price risks. Changes in Risk There have been no changes in the College's risk exposure from the prior year. 3. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE Accounts receivable includes an amount receivable for cost awar ds totalling $101,576 ($110,910 - 2020) net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $475,104 ( $475,104 - 2020). 4.

LEASE COMMITMENT The College has entered into a lease for its premises which expires on July 31, 2024. The minimum annual lease payments are as follows: Fiscal year ending March 31 2022 2024 114,384 2025 38,128 $ 381,280 In addition, the College is obligated to pay its proportionate share of operating costs and taxes which amounted to $55,176 ($87,434 - 2020). 7. CONTINGENT LIABILITY There is currently a matter under review to assess whether the College has a potential liability. As the outcome of this matter is not determinable at this time, no amounts have been recorded in the financial statements. 8. IMPACT OF GLOBAL PANDEMIC During March 2020, the global pa ndemic of the virus known as COVID-19 led the Canadian Federal government, as well as provincial and local governments, to impose measures, such asrestricting foreign travel, mandating self-isolations and physi cal distancing and closing non- essential businesses. These measures have temporarily reduced certain operations of theCollege. The College is continuing to serve its members remotely and through online formats. Because of the high level of uncertainty related to the outcome of this pandemic, it is difficult to estimate the financial effect on the College. No adjustments ha ve been made in the financial statements for these events. 12Draft Statements Subject to RevisionCOLLEGE OF TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE PRACTITIONERS AND ACUPUNCTURISTS OF ONTARIO SCHEDULE OF EXPENSES YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2021 2021 2020 Consulting and professional services Professional services $ 82,248 $ 138,954 82,248 138,954 Special programs and projects Special 331,665 214,939 Information technology 217,615 185,417 549,280 400,356 Office and operational costs costs 359,344 671,434 $ 359,344 $ 671,434 13Draft Statements Actuals of Q1 2021-2022 Annual Budget 2021-2022 Actual to Budget % Budget Remaining (balance of Year) GL Code Revenue 4101000 Registration Fees 78,400.00 $ 124,750.00 $ 62.44% $ 2,865,900.00 95.69% $ 123,564.88 GL Code $ 115,151.21 $ 4.80% 356,050.81 $ 6207000 Fitness to Committee - $ 4,250.00 $ 0.00% 4,250.00 $ 6208000 Examination Appeals Committee - 2,750.00 0.00% 2,750.00 6300000 $ 41,400.20 $ School - $ 57,000.00 $ 0.00% 57,000.00 $ 6405000 Safety and $ $ 28.17% 12,211.06 $ 1,106,587.18 $ 16.30% 46,683.95 73,576.04 $ Total Expenses 748,232.10 20.64% Net Income 1,994,103.02 $ $ (759,363.00) UNAUDITED College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of Ontario Statement of Operations 1st Quarter ( April 01,2021- June 30,2021)Page 1 of 10 \u00a92021 CTCMPAO 55 Commerce Valley Drive West | Suite 705 I Thornhill , Ontario I L 3T 7V9 I Phone : 416.238.7359 I fax : 416.214.0879 I info@ctcmpao.on.ca Financial Statements 1st Quarter April 2021 - June 2021 Highlights and Points of interest College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of Ontario Page 2 of 10 \u00a92021 CTCMPAO 55 Commerce Valley Drive West | Suite 705 I Thornhill , Ontario I L 3T 7V9 I Phone : 416.238.7359 I fax : 416.214.0879 I info@ctcmpao.on.ca Contents What is a Balance Sheet? .......................................................................................................................... 3 What is a Profit & Loss Statement? .......................................................................................................... 3 What is a Statement of Operations? ........................................................................................................ 4 1.

The balance sheet presents a company's financial position at the end of a specified date. The balance sheet can be described as a \"snapshot\" of the financial position of the organization at a point in time. For example, the amounts reported on a balance sheet dated March 31, reflect that instant when all the transactions through March 31 have been recorded. The major components of the Balance Sheet are: Assets, Liabilities and Equity Assets: Assets are the resource with economic value that the company owns or controls. It will provide benefit s to the company. (for example: Cash, Account Receivable, Prepaid Expenses , Fixed Assets , etc.) Liabilities: Liabilities are obligations or financial debt of the company that requires the company to give up an economic benefit to settle p ast transactions or events. (for e xample: Account Payable, Deferred Revenue , Accrued Expenses , etc.) Equity: Equity states the value left over for shareholders if a company would utilize its assets to meet the liability obligations. The accounting equation is: Assets minus Liabilities equals Equity What is a P rofit & Loss Statement? The Profit & Loss statement is a financial statement that summarizes the revenue, expense that incurred over a particular period. The purpose of the profit and loss statement is showing whether the company earned or lost money during the period being reported. Under the acc rual basis of accounting, the profit and loss statement consisted of: the revenues (sales, service fees) that were earned during the accounting period, and the expenses (salaries, rent, legal fee etc.) that match the revenues being reported or have expired during the accounting period the profit is the financial benefit when the amount of revenue exceeds the amount of expense. Profit is calculated as revenues minus expenses.

The statement of operations summarizes a company's revenues and expenses over the entire reporting period . The Statement of Operations measures the budget variance between budgeted and actual figures . In expense section, a favorable budget variance refers to positive variances or gains, and unfavorable variance refers to a negative budget variance or shortfall; it's on the opposite under revenue section, a favorable various refers to a negative varianc e, and unfavorable variance refers to a positive variance.

Variance between Actuals and Annual Budget prediction is compared with the assumption that a quarter value has a 25% cap. For example, for the third quarter we expect expenses or revenue close to 75% will indicate that we are on target, any expenses or revenue less or greater than 75 % indicates over budget or underbudget. First Quarter - 25% Second Quarter - 50% Third Quarter - 75% Fourth Quarter - 100% Havin g said that, there are few exceptions to take in consideration. For example, our main source of revenue is collected between Feb -March of the current calendar year and is deferred to the first quarter of the new fiscal year, that means the actual revenue will far exceed the 25 % percent expectation of a first quarter. Same exceptions may also apply for item line expenses, where the bulk of the expense (for example Audit) is incurred in one single quarter. 2.Balance Sheet 2.1 Point of Interests for 1st Quarter Balance Sheet Current Assets: The College has 4 Bank Accounts, each one of them with its own purpose: 1.Investment Account: This is the total amount of \"cash\" owned by the College.

EXECUTIVE Issue The College does not have a formal policy for processing per diem claims of professional members. This has led to inconsistency in the process, and confusion over what members are eligible to claim. Public Interest Rationale The College is required to be financially responsible and transparent. A lack of per diem policy puts the College at risk of not meeting this requirement, as it is currently unable to ensure that per diems are processed consistently or transparently . Background College staff have drafted a policy for the Committee's consideration. This policy will apply to professional members of C ouncil and Committees, and has been drafted based on current practices as to not cause much disruption to members . However, some changes are being proposed to improve the process. The policy is set out in three sections : Procedures The first section deals with procedure, and the major change being proposed is in this section. Staff are proposing that instead of submitting a per diem form after each meeting/claim, members will instead submit their forms once a month, with all claims from that month included. Staff will ask that member s submit their forms within 7 days of the end of the month, so that payments can be processed on the first payroll date of the month. Forms received after 7 days, may be processed on the second payroll date of the m onth. In addition, claims from previous fiscal years will not be processed, unless they are received shortly after the end of the fiscal year (fiscal year is April 1 - March 31). This is being proposed because this will create a more efficient system, and reduce the amount of paperwork for both Council members and staff. After an adjustment period, it is anticipated that this will improve the process greatly. Per Diem Rates This section sets out the per diem rates. No changes are being proposed in this section . Per Diem Eligibility This section sets out requirements for a claim to be eligible for a per diem. Only items in this list can be claimed. The list is largely similar to the College's current process . Once this policy is finalized and approved, Co llege staff will follow it for processing all claims from professional members. Mee ting Date: September 22 , 2021 Issue: Francesco Ortale Action: Motion EXECUTIVE Next Steps Committee to discuss policy contents . Request changes or approve policy to be implemented. Enc l: Per Diem Policy Background The purpose of the policy is to establish the amounts and process for compensation of professional Council and Committee members of the College. Profession al members of CTCMPAO's Council or its committees will receive remuneration for participation in College business as set out in this policy. Procedures In order to ensure consistent and efficient processing of claims, the following process will apply to all per diem claims: Members may submit claims based on rates and eligibility as set out in this policy. Members must submit their claims via the College Per Diem Form to College staff designated by the Registrar. Receipts are required in support of all expens e claims. Receipts must be submitted with Expense Form. - Exception for meals. Receipts not required for eligible meal claims. Claims will be verified by program managers, and processed by College staff . Members will submit one Per Diem Form per month, and include claims that occurred in that month. - Payment for each month will be processed following the College's payroll schedule . For members to receive payment on the first payroll date of the month, they should submit their form within 7 days of the end of the month. Forms received after 7 days may be processed on the second payroll date of the month. If a delay in processing happ ens, College staff will notify the member of the delay. - If members do not include a claim from a particular month on the Per Diem Form from that month, they may include it on future submissions, provided it is within the same fiscal year. Claims from a previous fiscal year , that are received more than 14 days after that fiscal year ends (current fiscal year is April 1 - March 31) , will not be processed. Tax documents will be provided by staff annually . To ensure the relevancy of this policy, College staff will bring it to Council for review on an annual basis. Items to be reviewed are per diem rates, items eligible for claims, and the procedure for processing claims. Per Diem Rates The charts below set out the rates and maximum allowable per diems . Actual amounts will depend on the specifics of the claim. Members must follow the Per Diem Eligibility section below when entering their claims into the Per Diem Form. Full and Half Per Diem Amounts Position Full Per Diem Half Per Diem Professional $325 $162.50 Additional Rates and Maximum Allowable Amounts Claim Type Rate Maximum Decision Writing and Deliberation $45/hour $275 /item Travel Eligibility Below is a list of items that are eligible for Per Diem claims.

Public Interest Rational e The CPMF has been implemented by the Ministry of Health to ensure colleges are regulating in the public interest according to Ministry standards. The College will be required to make changes to meet these standards. Background As previously reported, the College did not meet all standards of the CPMF (see attached Executive Summary for reference ). In this item, staff will provide information on meeting 3 of the deficiencies . a.Financi al Reserve Policy Standard 4.1 b. of the CPMF asks if colleges have a financial reserve policy in place that has been validated by an auditor. The College does have a financial reserve policy, and it has been reviewed by an auditor; however, the auditor has made some minor suggestions to improve our policy. In order to fully meet this requirement, the Executive Committee will need to review these changes for decision. Please see attached the College's financial reserve policy. b.Orga nizational Chart Standard 4.1 c. of the CPMF states that Council is re sponsible for ensuring that the organization had the workforce that it needs to be successful. The College has an organizational chart (attached) , and it is providing it to the Executive Committee for their information. c.KPIs a nd Strategic Plan Standard 1 5.1 a. requires colleges to provide information on key performance indicators (KPIs) used in measuring the College's success. Currently, the College uses its workplan to measure its progress against the strategic plan, but it does not have a public document to demonstrate this. Staff have put together a draft chart to detail this information, which could be put on the College's website. This chart will be updated quarterly with key items that relate to the strategic plan. Please see the chart attached below. In th e future, setting KPIs will need to be part of the strategic planning process to comply with the CPMF. The College's current strategic plan has expired; however due to the Council being unconstituted, the strategic planning session is currently on hold. Next Steps The Executive Committee can discuss these items and provide any comments or feedback they may have. Sta ff will continue to update Council members on our progress towards meeting CPMF requirements. Meeting Date: September 22 , 2021 Issue: College Performance Measurement Framework Reported By: Ann Zeng, Sean Cassman Action: Discussion , Motion 1 | Page College Performance Measurement Framework (CPMF) Executive Summary 1 | Page Summary of Responses Each standard of the CPMF contains a set of measures and requirements. Many of these ask colleges the requirements of the measure (response options of yes, partially, or no). In total, Colleges are asked to respond to 37 of these questions. For these 37 questions, the college responded yes to 26, partially to 9, and no to 2. The standards within Domain 3 (standards 5, 6, and 7) do not contain any of these questions. Below is a summary of the College's responses: Action Items The College has reviewed measures where it has indicated that it has not met or partially met the requirement, and identified a plan to address each deficiency. The College believes some deficiencies will be addressed in the next reporting period, while others may require a long-term project to address. The College will ensure to provide updates on these action items in the next CPMF report. Below is a table of these action items.

EXECUTIVE Issue The College Performance Measurement Framework (CPMF) Includes a requirement that Council and Committee members meet a set of competencies to be eligible for the role. In addition to this, competency -based selection is a major recommendation of most governance reviews and reforms by regulators across Canada, and is something that has been implemented by other Colleges already. Because of this, it is strongly recommended that the Executive Committee considers how the College may implement a competency framework for its Council . Public Interest Rational e Council and Committee members are responsible for the decision making on policy matters of the College, and for ensuring that decisions are in the interest of public protection. It is because of this important function that there is increased pressure to have council and committee members meet a competency framework to be eligible . Background At the previous open meeting of the Executive Committee, staff presented an HPRO template of competencies , which is already being adopted by other Colleges, that the College may use as a starting point. The Executive Committee and observing Council members requested that staff prepare more research on how different colleges have implemented competencies into their election. For this meeting staff have prepare d some examples of election processes with competencies. Ontario College of Pharmacists of Ontario The Ontario College of Pharmacists (OCP) asks potential Board members to complete an application form, which beyond the type of information we currently ask, also asks the members to fill out information on their relevant experience and core competencies, behavioural attributes, and three letters of reference that directly speak to the members leadership and governance experience. It sh ould be noted that in addition to looking for certain competencies, the OCP identifies other needs that should be filled by professional members. For example, the OCP is currently looking for Board members with patients in northern or remote communities, patients in long- term care, patients treated at community hospitals, and other specific areas of practice . The a pplications will then go through a number of levels of screening. First, staff will do a screening to make sure the member meets basic eligibility (i.e. is a member in good standing) . Next, the OCP contracts external governance consultants to conduct a short- listing of candidates based on their review of candidates' application, including self -assessment of their own skills, competencies, attributes or particular ex pertise. This short list is then provided to the Screening Committee of the OCP. Meeting Date: September 22 , 2021 Issue: Council Member Competencies Reported By: Ann Zeng and Sean Cassman Action: Decision EXECUTIVE The Screening Committee, which is composed of the chair of the Governance Committee and 4 additional member s (3 of which must be public members). Once the Screening Committee has a short - list of candidates, they review the applications, and invite candidates to participate in an interview. The interview will focus on determining if candidates meet the essential criteria as well as desired personal and behavioral competencies. The Screening Committee is responsible for ensuring there are candidates that range of needs on the board are met with qualified candidates. Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario The Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario (RCDSO) is another College that has adopted competency requirements to be eligible for elections. These competencies were approved in June of 2020, and cover the three categories of values and behaviour, relevant knowledge, and skills and abilities. As part of the requirements for standing for election, members must submit a letter detailing how they meet the competencies. The information provided by the member in their letter is then reviewed by the RCDSO's E lections Committee. The Committee is comprised of 3 public members of the RCDSO's Council, and their primary function is to address eligibility of members to run for election. The Committee will review each candidate's competency, and issue a written decis ion with reasons. Members who are not otherwise eligible to stand for election may appeal to the Elections Committee for special consideration. In these cases, the Committee may wave certain requirements to allow a member to be eligible for election. The RCDSO has an additional requirement for eligibility, which is the Candidate Eligibility Course. All members who wish to sit on Council or Committees must successfully complete this course as a by-law requirement. The Elections Committee will also ensure co mpliance with this requirement before a candidate can be allowed to stand for election. The course covers six sections: About RCDSO Governing legislation RCDSO committees RCDSO Council Council member conduct Communications support The RCDSO has been using this course for 5 years, and is planning to refresh it ahead of its 2022 elections. College of Opticians The College of Opticians of Ontario also uses a competency -based system to determine eligibility for elections; however, it does not include all of the components of the ones listed previously. To assess if a member has the necessary competencies to be a Council member, their Governance Committee will conduct an interview with the member. During the interview, members must demonstrate the competen ce in the following areas: EXECUTIVE Passion - public service oriented Exemplified integrity Unbiased and openminded Critical judgement and decision making Collaboration and inclusion The College of Opticians Governance Committee must include 2 public members, 1 professional member from Council, and 1 professional member who is not on Council. In addition to demonstrating their competencies, candidates must also complete chapter 4 of their jurisprudence course, which covers the RHPA. Next Steps At the open Executive Committee meeting of June 22, 2021, it was suggested that a working group be put together to develop competencies. It may be important to revisit this suggestion to further evaluate the pros and cons of establishing a working group. As HPRO has developed a competency template that the College can use as a starting point, the amount of work involved with this project has been reduced. The main challenge will be deciding on which specific competencies will be used. For this, College staff is proposing that it will be better to have the full input of everyone on Council who wishes to provide it. Making decisions on specific competencies in a working group may limit the amount of input, and have some Council members feeling left out of the process. This will also save costs on holding separate working group meetings. Staff are proposing to hold a special meeting dedicated to competencies to get the process started. This could possibly take place before the regularly scheduled meeting in December. Staff are proposing that this meeting be chaired by a facilitator to guide discussion and ensure that all Council members may participate . The agenda could include: A presentation by a representative of a college that currently uses competencies for their Council . Priority setting: - Detailed review of initial draft competencies prepared by staff, based on HPRO competencies - What are the biggest needs of CTCMPAO's Council (how does it differ from other colleges)? - What are the most challenging aspects of a Council member's role? - What attributes might an ideal Council member have? Deciding on high level competencies, which would be broken down into more specific indicators later. Following this meeting, Council can continue to discuss indicators at regularly scheduled open executive meetings/Council meetings as required. Once Council has agreed upon a set of competencies and indicators, the next step would be to determine how we will assess the competencies of candidates. Encl: HPRO Board/Council Competencies and Eligibility/Disqualification Criteria BOARD/COUNCIL COMPETENCIES AND ELIGIBILITY/DISQUALIFICATION CRITERIA As of 2019 -10-31 Page 1 of 11 INTRODUCTION This document articulates broad Board/Council competencies for RHPA College consideration. Competencies are listed for both individuals and Boards/Councils as a whole , and they include definitions/descriptions of those competencies and indicators for competency measurement . Indications on whether the competency is a \"must have\" as the person assumes the role or if the competency can be learned are also provided. Note that competenc ies related to clinical knowledge and experience ha ve not been included in the competencies for individual directors. These competencies can also be applied to committees and committee members, although perhaps not as rigorously. It is recogni zed that committe e service could assist in training/educating a person for a future position on the Board /Council. A list of eligibility and disqualification criteria follows . This information was gathered from 14 RHPA Colleges' current by -laws, processes and/or procedures . Any application to a position on the Board/Council or Committee must be consistent with that criteria or the person applyin g would not proceed further in the application process. Reference document s are also listed at the conclusion of this document. This material includes recent reports and promising practices in health profession regulation . Colleges are encouraged to use this document and reference material, customizing the information to suit individual profession -/organizational culture -specific needs.

Public Rationale The College is mandated to regulate the profession in the public interest, and we must be able to demonstrate that we are doing this in order to maintain the trust of those we are accountable to (namely the public and Ministry of Health). The annual report helps us do th at by detailing the activities of the College over the previous year. This is used by the Ministry, along with the new CPMF, to monitor our performance. It can also be accessed by the public and members of the profession. Therefore, approving an annual rep ort that gives a transparent look at the College's activities is an important function of Council each year. Meeting Date: September 22 , 2021 Subject : Draft 2020 - 2021 Annual Report Reported By: Ann Zeng Action: Motion EXECUTIVE Issue To review the proposed recommendations developed as part of the QA Program Enhancement Project (Phase 1). Public Interest Rationale The goal of the P roject is to develop a QA Program that meets both the College's legislative requirements and supports professional development and continued competence of the profession. The QA Program supports TCM practitioners and acupuncturists in the delivery of safe, effective, and ethical care to their patients. Background A Request for Proposals (RFP) wa s announced in February 2020 for a Quality Assurance Program Enhancement Project. In June 2020, the Committee approved Igor Gontcharov as the Consultant for the QA Program Enhancement Project . The Project includes four inter -connected methods: 1. Policy Review (Jurisdictional and Literature Review), 2. Program Review (QA Program Review/Needs Analysis, Online Self -Assessment Tools and Tracking Solution Review), 3. Key Stakeholder Interviews, 4. Report and Recommendations. A draft of the final report and recommendations were presented to the QA Committee at the June 3, 2021, committee meeting. At their August 12, 2021 meeting, the QA C ommittee accepted the final report for Phase 1. The key outcome identified at the end of Phase 1 , is that the College needs to increase the responsiveness and reflexivity of the current QA Program. To this end, the final report recommends a Responsive and Reflexive Quality Assurance Framework (RRQA). The RRQA Framework focuses on advancing the QA infrastructure through ev idence- based, collaborative and participatory program development. The final report recommends the following as the key components of an RRQA Program: 1. Online platform for effective administration and support of the QA Program 2. Establishment of a Base and S pecialized QA process 3. An integrated professional development ecosystem, RRQA places all components of the QA Program under the umbrella of professional development 4. Responsive QA tools 5. Two -step Peer and Practice Assessment a) STEP 1 - a conversational online s cenario-based interview b) STEP 2 - a reworked RRQA version of the current PPA process. The report also highlights the need to e ngage stakeholders in the development of the QA Program. Meeting Date: September 22, 2021 Issue: QA Program Enhancement Project Reported By: Ann Zeng Action: Motion EXECUTIVE A copy of the Executive Summary and a summary of the recommendations are included for review. We have also invited the P roject consultant, Mr. Igor Gontcharov , to present a summary of the report and the framework to Council. The QA Committee recommends that Council adopt, in general, the Responsive and Reflexive Quality Assurance Framework (RRQA) as the CTCMPAO QA Framework.

Encl: Executive Summary and Summary of Recommendations QA Enhancement Project - Final Report Executive Summary This Report offers recommendations to enhanc e the Quality Assurance ( QA) Progra m of the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of Ontario . The solutions are based on the outcomes of the QA Enhancement Project, Phase 1 - Research , conducted in August 2020 - February 2021. Phase 1 includ es the Conceptual and Jurisdictional Analysis , Program Review , Stakeholder Interview , and the QA Program Survey . The need to increas e the responsiveness and reflexivity of the current QA Program is the key outcome of the research phase of the QA Enhancement Project. A Responsive and Reflexive Quality Assurance Framewor k (RRQA) has been developed as a methodology for enhancing the College's approach to QA. The RRQA framework assumes a broader critical perspective at QA to comprehensively assess the regulatory space of QA and contributions of multiple policy actors . RRQA is a knowledge mobilization strategy that enabl es regulatory health colleges to optimize the resources and increase the quality and effectiveness of the College's QA Program through continuous evidence -based and participatory program development. The Regulated Health Professions Act (RHPA ), 1991, s.80.1, requires regulatory health colleges to set up a QA Program with (a) Professional Development , (b) Self-, Peer -, and Practice Assessment , and (c) methods to monitor compliance , as its major components . These requirements define the minimum standard for the Quality Assurance Program . The Ontario Regulation 28/13: Quality Assurance Program of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Act , 2006, also includes promoting Interprofessional Collaboration under (a) Professional Development. Accordingly, t he College's QA Program incorporates the minimum requirements (as set out in the RHPA) , along with the interprofessional collaboration provision as part of professional development. Regulators face multiple challenges in designing and maintaining a comprehensive and effective QA Program . The regulatory space of QA has some points of tension and is characterized by pre-existing standards and expectations . Regulated professions are unique with th eir own distinct backgrounds, resources, and priorities . Data on the performance of the QA Program's components and processes are limited , and regulatory solutions are not directly portable. The RRQA Framework, offered here for the consideration of the QA Committee and the Council, considers QA with in a broader context of professional governance, in which the College's QA Program plays an integral part. The focus is made on advancing the QA infrastructure in a close collaboration with the public and the profession. RRQA enables the responsiveness and reflexivity of the governance nodes , thus increas ing the capacity and activat ing the policy actors' ability of contributing to QA. RRQA is a forward -looking solut ion that is designed to generate performance data , while encourag ing a deeper understanding of \"public interest \" and \"self-regulation \", thus support ing a continuous evidence - based QA Program development that is consistent with the College Performance Measurement Framework (CPMF) and right touch regulation . RRQA utilizes a new approach to monitoring compliance to address the limitations of the current models. In contrast to \"administrative\" approaches as a primary way of ensuring compliance , RRQA emphasizes \"soft\" approaches, as well as promot es the culture of Q uality Assurance and Quality Improvement (QI) in the profession. QA Enhancement Project - Final Report Knowledge mobilization, trust, strong professional, interprofessional and social n etworks, best practices exchange, professional ethics, active research agenda, community engagement, and life -long learning are central to supporting a vibrant and responsive professional environment . These elements are key to effective s ocial control - an indirect \"soft law\" approach to monitoring compliance . The enhanced QA Program will be implemented in two stages during 2021 -2024: Stage 1. Implementation ( 24 months) - major points : Engag es Stakeholders in QA governance to develop an RRQA -based QA Program. Program development is an integral part of the RRQA Program. Introduces a new Online Platform for effective administration and support of the QA Program. The Online platform features an intuitive remotely accessible database, engaging and pers onalized PD tools, while tracing PD activity and communicating the right information back to members, and generating aggregate statistics for the College. Establishes Base and Specialized QA processes . The distinction supports a more effective use of resou rces to support day -to-day operations, while promptly identifying and a ddress ing common and emerging issues , as well as rapidly responding to changes in practice and regulatory environment . Advances an Integrated PD Ecosystem . From being subsidiary to monitoring participation in and compliance with the QA Program, Self-Assessment and Peer and Practice Assessment come to the front as approaches to Professional Development. Educational tools that focus on the standards of practi ce and best practices exchange are envisioned as central to the Integrated PD Ecosystem. Develops Responsive Tools with feedback options on the tool itself and the QA Program to promote member engagement and responsibility for the QA Program outcomes, whil e improving communication with members. Introduces a Two -Step Peer and Practice Assessment (PPA) process that optimizes the use of resources and increases PPA's effectiveness by providing more attention and support to those practitioners who require it mo st, and by identifying common (standards of practice and business -related) issues that are best addressed through Specialized QA Processes . The Two -step PPA process consists of STEP 1 is a conversational online scenario -based interview to (a) assess how practitioners understand and follow the Standards of Practice and the QA Program requirements. (b) detect common issues (=> addressed through Specialized QA ). (c) identify practitioners for a deeper PPA at the place of practice (=> STEP 2 ). STEP 2 is a reworked RRQA version of the current PPA process. Stage 2 . Review and Adjustment (6 months) Reviews the performance of the RRQA model and introduces necessary corrections. EXECUTIVE QA Program Enhancement Project (Phase 1) - Summary of Recommendations The key outcome identified at the end of Phase 1, is that the College needs to increase the responsiveness and reflexivity of its QA Program. To this end, the final report recommends a Responsive and Reflexive Quality Assurance Framework (RRQA). The RRQA Framework focuses on advancing the QA infrastructur e through evidence-based, collaborative and participatory program development. The terms \"responsive\" and \"reflexive' are defined on page 3. The proposed RRQA includes the following key elements: Knowledge mobilization and exchange - to progressively address knowledge gaps and develop effective regulatory solutions ; Continuous program review and development - engages stakeholders in designing and testing professional development tools and processes ; aligned with the principles of right touch regulation (see definition on page 3) ; Transition from paper -based processes to a Digital Office (e.g., Member Portal, electronic QAP tools and records (SAT, PD, PPAs) to facilitate staff reviews and monitoring of emerging trends, feedback mechanisms, monitoring and analysis of emerging/common issues); Integrated PD ecosystem - Self-Assessment , and Peer and Practice Assessment as approaches to Professional Development . The following provides a summary of the Phase 1 recommendations : 1. Develop QA Program performance indicators, incorporating CPMF criteria and right touch regulation requirements 2. Develop an online platform for effective administration and support of the QA Program. 3. Establish Base and Specialized QA Processes a. Base QA i. Professional development - integrated PD ecosystem; Self -Assessment s, and Peer and Practice Assessment s are approaches to Professional Development. Develop learning tools and feedback mechanisms Member portal / PD platform - multi -mode (webpage, n ewsletter, survey, direct communication, social media) Professional Development Space. Include o nline professional development tools and s cenario - based interactive learning tools ii. Self-assessment - checkboxes phase-out; develop a new approach to self - assessments. Enable self -assessment by supporting members ' engagement in professional development iii. Peer and practice assessment - a Two -Step Peer and Practice Assessment process to optimize the use of resources and increase PPA's effectiveness by providing more attention and support to those practitioners who require it most, and by identifying common (standards of practice and business -related) issues that are best addressed through Specialized QA Processes EXECUTIVE STEP 1 - Conversational online scenario -based interview to (a) assess how practitioners understand and follow the Standards of Practice and the QA Program requirements ; (b) detect common issues (=> addressed through Specialized QA) ; (c) identify practitioners for a deeper PPA at the p lace of practice (=> STEP 2) STEP 2 is an RRQA version of the current PPA process iv. Compliance monitoring - establish mechanisms to monitor compliance through the Member Portal; e ngage indirect ways of ensuring compliance through social means, e.g., broader community audit, visibility of peer -assessment, promotion of the culture of QI and QA (see definitions on page 3) v. Remediation - develop mechanisms to pre-emptively address common and emerging issues through Specialized QA (see below); enhance t he current c ase- based approach with the launch of the Online Professional Development Platform b. Specialized QA i. Develop Specialized QA processes to promptly address common and emerging issues. Specialized QA is a more flexible, situational approach to QA that is based on continuous QA and QI research, analysis of the QA Program performance data, broader QA governance, inter -program knowledge exchange. Specialized QA Processes may include such methods as educational tools, special studies, research programs, awards, collaborative projects, and interactive learning ii. QA Research and Governance Working Group - to establish partnerships with policy actors, and coordinate knowledge mobilization initiatives, such as interprofessional collaboration. 4. QA Governance - engage stakeholder groups (e.g., TCM Schools and Associations, the Ontario Ministry of Health, Regulatory Health Colleges, Communities of Practice, Members, and Patients) in QA and standard -setting ; the QA Program as an integral element of the College's regulatory strategy, designed to mobilize knowledge across programs and among stakeholders and to advance the College's agenda in respect to practitioner competence, stakeholder engagement, and public confidence. Definitions The final Phas e 1 report provides the following definitions: Quality Improvement (QI)* 1 emphasizes contextual and experiential frameworks and various sets of principles, such as proportionality to the posed risks, consistency, transparency, accountability, lifelong le arning, interprofessional collaboration, reflexivity, and adaptability. EXECUTIVE Responsiveness - the QA Program's capacity to learn from and with its participants. Stakeholder engagement in program evaluation and development is one way to increasing responsiveness. Reflexivity - the QA Program's capacity to generate meaningful data on its performance and act on the findings. Right- touch regulation - the Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care proposed six guiding principles of right-touch regulation: it is proportional to the posed risks, consistent, targeted on the problem, transparent, accountable, and agile (reflexive and adaptable). Right- touch regulation discourages the use of regulation if professionals themselves can address the risk more effectively, avoids being overly prescriptive, and encourages regulatory measures leading to positive professional changes and the exercise of professional judgement (Right- touch regulation, October 2015 ). 1 In their Technical Specifications for Quantitative College Performance Measurement Framework Measures , the Ontario Ministry of Health provides the following definitions for QA and QI QA activity and assessment: the different types of QA activities and assessments that registrants undergo/undertake to improve their practice and/or a College uses t o assess the ongoing competence of registrant's practice, including any activity and assessment that assesses (either through self -assessment or College assessment) knowledge, skills and judgment or expectations for a registrant's practice and where non- compliance may lead to a QA Committee referral (e.g., article review, peer circles, CPD portfolio review/audit, practice site visit/inspection, patient chart audit/chart -simulated examination, multi- source feedback/360- degree reviews, clinical simula tion or objective structured clinical examination, direct observation in practice, etc.). QI activity and assessment: the different types of quality improvement activities and assessments that use a preventative/proactive approach and are more focused on individual practice and self -assessments to identify opportunities for self -directed learning and improvement in an individual's practice. These activities occur outside of the legislated QA Program and include activities, such as, for example a Quality Im provement Survey, Practice Profile, Self -Guided Chart Review; Data -Driven Quality Improvement; and a Practice Improvement Plan. EXECUTIVE Issue The creation of a telepractice guideline : to help members of the College understand the complexities of telepractice ; and to help members determine if telepractice is an appropriate approach in their practice. The guideline will highlight the key standards and regulations that apply to teleprac tice. Public Interest Rationale With a changing work and social environment, alternative methods to in -person service have become important considerations in providing healthcare. Telepractice is one of the methods that has grown in use in recent years. The goal of the telepractice Guide line is to help practitioners understand their responsibilities when providing care using telecommunication technologies. This is to ensure that practitioners engaged in telepractice comply with all existing practice requirements and provide safe, effectiv e, and ethical care to patients. Backgroun d The Quality Assurance Committee has approved a draft Telepractice Guideline for consideration at a previous QAC meeting . The draft guideline has been sent to key stakeholders including TCM associations, TCM scho ols, and other TCM regulators in Canada. The College did not receive any negative feedback from these organization, with most comments saying it was well done and would benefit members. The next step if for the Executive Committee to review the draft befo re it is sent for a public consultation. Next Step Review the guideline and decide if further revisions are necessary. Otherwise approve for public consultation. After the public consultation, the guideline will be brought back to Council for final approval. Encl: Telepractice Guideline Meeting Date: September 22 Guideline Reported By: Sean Cassman Action: Motion The College would like to thank the members of the Quality Assurance Committee for their ongoing guidance and for providing the necessary vision for the development of this guideline DRAFT Telepractice Guid eline Version 6.0 May 2021 1. Introduction With a changing work and social environment, alternative methods to in -person service have become important considerations in providing healthcare. Telepractice is one of the methods that has grown in use in recent years. In the Spring of 2020, the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of Ontario (CTCMPAO) developed a position statement on telepractice. The College developed the position statement as a temporary measure to provide guidance on telepractice as an alternative to in -person service during the COVID -19 pandemic. However, as technology evolves and is increasingly integrated into the provision of healthcare services, it is expected that telepractice will become a more prominent model of care. Building on the June 1, 2020 position statement, this guideline is designed to provide a more comprehensive overview that will help practitioners understand their responsibilities when providing care using telecommunication technologies. Telepractice (also called virtual practice) can be defined as the use of telecommunications technology to deliver healthcare services without direct contact between the practitioner and the patient. While technology continues to change, some examples of techn ology used in telepractice include telephone, email and video conferencing. It is important to note that this guideline cannot address all situations that may arise with the use of telepractice. Members engaging in telepractice are expected to stay infor med on relevant changes to regulations, standards, and policies and to use their knowledge, skill and judgment to ensure they comply with the expectations of the College. For the purposes of this guideline, members of CTCMPAO will be referred to as \"practitioners.\" Key points Practitioners engaged in telepractice are accountable for the care they provide to their patients. They must use their professional judgement to assess on a case -by- case basis if the use of telepractice is in the patient's best interest. Practitioners engaged in telepractice must comply with all existing practice requirements, including the profession's scope of practice, the standards of practice, and any relevant regulations. Practitioners who engage in telepractice must ensure they have the competencies (knowledge, skills, and judgment) to provide safe and effective virtual care to their patients. 2 2. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Telepractice The Traditional Chinese Medicine Act, 2006 , defines the scope of traditional Chinese medicine as the assessment of body system disorders through traditional Chinese medicine techniques and treatment using traditional Chinese medicine therapies to promote, maintain or restore health. In the context of traditional Chinese medicine, t he primary benefit of telepractice is ensuring the continuity of care and accessibility. Providing virtual care can improve accessibility when, for example, physical contact is discouraged due to a health pandemic, there is a shortage of practitioners in a geographical region, or when patients have transportation or mobility issues. However, it should be noted, teleprac tice has its limitations. For example, TCM practitioners and acupuncturists rely on several diagnostic methods to conduct patient assessments. This includes physically assessing patients by palpitation or pulse examination. In the case of telepractice, these physical assessment methods are not feasible. In addition, telepractice limits the number of modalities used in traditional Chinese medicine; these include, for example, acupuncture, cupping, gua sha, and Tuina. Taking into consideration both the limitations and benefits of telepractice, practitioners must use their professional judgement to determine on a case-by -case basis: If telepractice is appropriate and in the best interest of the patient? If the virtual examination is sufficient to formulate a TCM diagnosis and treatment plan? Or if other diagnostic methods are more appropriate for the particular patient? If treatments available through telepractice are the best options for the patient's co ndition? Practitioners must also consider if they have the skills and competencies required to treat patients remotely. For example, do they have the communication skills to obtain the necessary information through questioning? Further, do they have the n ecessary technological equipment to effectively provide TCM care via telepractice? If a practitioner determines that virtual care is appropriate for a particular patient, they will need to ensure that there is a plan in place to deal with unforeseen and adverse events such as medical emergencies or technological /connection problems. The following list includes examples of TCM services that may be provided via telepractice: Initial assessment and monitoring - in addition to a review of the patient's medical history, diet, lifestyle and habits a practitioner, may use the TCM diagnostic technique of inquiry to collect information to determine a diagnosis . Home-based modalities - for example, i n some cases, it m ay be appropriate to guide the patient to perform acupressure or practice therapeutic exercises such as Taiji or Qi Gong . Herbal medicine - if the practitioner believes enough information has been collected to determine a diagnosis, a herbal prescription can be prescribed to proceed with an herbal treatment of the patient . Dietary therapy and lifestyle advice - similarly, when appropriate, practitioners may provide dietary and lifestyle advice remotely. 3 NOTE: Telepractice is not acceptable in the following two scenarios: Clinical Experience Requirement - Applicants for registration are required to complete a program of c linical experience in the profession, which involves specified hours of direct patient contact. It is the College's position that all supervised clinical training must be provided in person. The clinical experience requirement cannot be satisfied through telepractice. Supervised Practice Requirements - Some members of the College may be required to practice under supervision. It is the College's position that the supervisor and the practitioner being supervised are, at all times, physically present at the treatment location. The supervised practice requirement cannot be satisfied through telepractice. 3. Jurisdictional Considerations and Registration Requirements The jurisdiction for the traditional Chinese medicine practice is dependant on a variety of factors, including the location of the patient and the practitioner . A practitioner must be registered with CTCMPAO to preform any of the controlled acts 1authorized to the profession or us e the protected titles in Ontario. Although acupuncture cannot be provided via telepractice, communicating a TCM diagnosis can occur. Therefore, a practitioner must be registered in Ontario to communicate a TCM diagnosis to a patient in Ontario. For example, if a practitioner based in Britis h Columbia were to communicate a TCM diagnosis to a patient in Ontario, they would have to be registered with CTCMPAO. CTCMPAO members treating patients residing outside of Ontario must comply with the registration/licensing requirements in Ontario and the jurisdiction where the telepractice service will be provided. For example, if a CTCMPAO member were to provide remote care to a patient in British Columbia, the practitioner would be expected to abide by the regulations and standards in Ontario and British Columbia. Practitioners should also check with their professional liability insurance provider to ensure that they have proper coverage for providing care to patients located outside of Ontario. 4. Privacy and Confidentiality Practitioners must maintain the privacy of all patient personal health information as required by the Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004 (PHIPA) and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA). These requirements apply to both in -person and virtual care. Under PHIPA, practitioners are expected to take steps to ensure that personal health information is protected against theft, loss and unauthorized use or disclosure. Practitioners must also follow the law 1 CTCMPAO Members are authorized to perform two controlled acts: 1. Communicating a traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis identifying a body system disorder as the cause of a person's symptoms using traditional Chinese med icine techniques. 2. Performing a procedure on tissue below the dermis and below the surface of a mucous membrane for the purpose of performing acupuncture. 4 for collecting, using, and sharing personal health information. PHIPA sets out when a member must ask for consent to collect, use, and disclose personal health information. Practitioners are ultimately responsible for ensuring virtual care is provided in a manner that protects patients' confidentiality and the privacy of their personal health info rmation. To this end, practitioners must ensure that the technology and devices they use (e.g., laptops or phones) do not allow for accidental access of patient information to unauthorized parties. Practitioners should also evaluate if the patient's physic al setting and their own setting provide a safe, secure and confidential environment. Phone calls and videoconferencing sess ions should not be recorded unless the practitioner has the patient 's consent and can ensure the recording is stored properly . Note: Telepractice visits should only be conducted in a private space so that the privacy and confidentiality of the patient's personal health information are not compromised. Practitioners should take measures to ensure that an unintended third party cannot overhear their conversations with patients at either end of the conservation. It is crucial that patients understand the risks of receiving treatment by telepractice and provide consent before proceeding. For more information, see the Consent to Treatment section below. The Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario developed a fact sheet for Privacy and Security Considerations for Health Care Visits. Although, the fact sheet applies primarily to public sector and government organizations, many of the recommendations included in the document also apply to practitioners as health information custodians. Practitioners providing virtual care are strongly encouraged to review the guide. NOTE: When providing clinical advice or treatment information by email, practitioners should consider whether it's appropriate for the patient to receive this information electronically. Using encryption and password protection, a secure internet connection, and limiting how much personal health information is sent, may help to improve the safety and security of transmitting patient health information. For more information, see the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario (IPC) Fact Sheet: Communicating Personal Health Information by Email . At the start of the virtual visit, practitioners should verify the patient's identity. The practitioner's identity, location, and CTCMPAO registration status should also be confirmed. If anyone else is present with the practitioner, it is important to ensure that they are introduced and that the patient consents to them b eing present during the visit. Practitioners should also check if anyone is accompanying the patient and, if so, confirm the patient's consent. 5. Technology The College cannot recommend a specific technology provider ; practitioners are expected to choose th e communication technologies that are most appropriate for their practice. Practitioners engaged in telepractice must understand the capabilities and limitations of the technology they choose such as security, data storage and technical trouble shooting. Any technology that is used to 5 provide virtual care must meet the Personal Health Information Protection Act , 2004 (PHIPA) requirements. PHIPA sets out the rules about the collection, use and disclosure of personal health information. These rules apply to all health information custodians in Ontario and to all individuals and organizations that receive personal health information from health information custodians. Under PHIPA, heath information custodians must implement technical, physical and administrative safeguards to protect personal health information. The Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario (IPC) provides examples of different measures to safeguard privacy, for example: Administrative Safeguards: privacy and security policies and procedures, staff training and confidentiality agreements , using professional ( not personal) email accounts Technical Safeguards: strong authentication and access controls, strong passwords and encryption, maintaining up -to-date software, firewalls and anti-malware scanners Physical Safeguards: controlled access to locations where personal information is stored, Keeping portable devices in secure location For more information, please see the Guide to the Personal Health Information Protection Act . Practitioners must ensure that they have the skills and training in the use of the telecommunication technology and that they have access to appropriate technical support. Practitioners should also consider the patient's needs, reliability and security of their devices (e.g., home computer, laptop, tablet, or cellphone), internet access, and access to technical support. Note : At the outset of a telepractice visit/session, practitioners should arrange for alternate means of contact in case of technical dif ficulties/connection loss. 6. Consent to Treatment The requirement for practitioners to obtain patients' consent for treatment is the same for telepractice and in- person patient care. However, in addition to receiving informed consent to provide treatment, practitioners should also obtain informed consent from patients to conduct an appointment via telepractice. In order to obtain informed consent before providing treatment through telepractice , practitioners must inform the patient about the risks, scope and limitations of telepractice . Practitioners must also have the patient's consent to collect, use and disclose personal health information using telecommunication technologies. Note : Before providing a telepractice treatment, practitioners should ensure that the patient is aware of the risks associated with providing services in ways other than in- person interactions . Once the telepractice session begins, practitioners must obta in the patient's informed consent before treatment. Consent is an ongoing process; practitioners should re-confirm consent at each visit/session and ensure that patients understand their right to withdraw consent. Practitioners must document consent in the patient's file. For more information, please see the Standard for Consent and the Health Care Consent Act , 1996. 6 7. Record Keeping Practition ers engaged in telepractice are required to maintain patient records in accordance with the College's Standard for Record Keeping. Practitioners must maintain comprehensive clinical records and document all patient encounters that take place through telepr actice. If applicable, patient records should clearly indicate that a service was provided remotely. For more detailed information, please see the Standard for Record Keeping and Record Keeping Guideline . 8. Fees and Billing Practitioners are already required to advise patients of fees prior to providing treatment. P ractitioners are also expected to advise their patients (upfront) of any additional fees associated with telepractice. The fee information must be clear and should not be misleading or hard to understand. Invoices should be an accurate representation of the service provided to the patient. If applicable, an invoice should indicate that a service was provided remotely. P ractitioners should advise their patients to check that insurance providers cover services provided by telepractice. For more information, please see the Standard for Advertising and the Advertising Guideline. 9. Maintaining Professional Boundaries Practitioners must establish and maintain professional boundaries with their patients and be aware of the potential for boundary violations. Telepractice may provide opportunities for more informal types of interaction, which may lead to potential boundary crossings. For example, suppose a practitioner allows for text messaging with patients. In that case, they should carefully consider their expectations of how and when they will use and respond to text messages from their patients. Members will also want to remember and consider how these text messages are incorporated into the patient record. Practitioners should also pay attention to the environment where telepractice will occur and avoid any personal items that may increase the risk for boundary crossings or violations. For more information, please refer to the Standard for Maintaining Professional Boundaries . 10. Professional Liability Insurance Practitioners are required to maintain Professional Liability Insurance coverage as specified in the College By-Laws. When engaged in telepractice, practitioners must ensure that their PLI policies offer adequate coverage for that type of service delivery. For more information, please see the Professional Liability Insurance Policy . 7 References College of Naturopaths of Ontario Regulatory Guidance: Telepractice - Providing Naturopathic Care at a Distance Telepractice Guid eline College of Occupational Therapists of Ontario : Guidelines for Telepractice in Occupational Therapy College of Optometrists : Telehealth Policy for Optometrists College of Physiotherapists of Ontario Virtu al Practice Virtu al Practice FAQS College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of British Columbia PRACTICE STANDARD : Tele-Practice During the Coronavirus (COVID -19) Pandemic College's Statement Regarding Tele -Practice During the COVID -19 Pandemic Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario A Guide to the Personal Health Information Protection Act Privacy and security considerations for virtual health care visits Recent PHIPA Amendments and Privacy/Sec urity Considerations for Virtual Care Ontario College of Social Workers and Social Service Workers Frequently As ked Qu estions EXECUTIVE Issue An update regarding public appointments to Council . Background The TCM Act, 2006 sets out that the Council shall be composed of at least five and no more than eight persons appointed by the Lieutenant Governor. Council has been unconstituted for over a year w ith a total of three P ublic members currently sitting on Council . Out of the three Public members, only two are actively attending Committee meetings. At the June 22, 2021 open meeting of the Executive Committee, Council had requested staff to reach out to the Public Appointments Secretariat (PAS) to inquire whether they would be available to attend the College's next scheduled Council / open meeting . The purpose was to have the PAS speak with Council and address questions and concerns regarding public appointments to Council . Staff extended an invitation to the PAS however the y responded that they do not have updates to provide at this time. The Co llege has also advised both the PAS and the Ministry regarding the current public members whose terms will be expiring within the coming year , and challenges with panel composition for the Discipline Committee due to the insufficient number of public members. T he PAS's response has remained the same. S taff will continue to regularly follow up with the PAS. Through the recommendation of severa l other colleges, the College contacted Counsel Public Affairs Inc. (Counsel), a government and public relations firm to address the urgent need to acquire public appointments. Counsel specializes in government relations, strategic communications, and integrated campaigns, and has experience advocating for regulated professions and regulatory colleges in Ontario. Couns el submitted a proposal to the College for review . At the August 19, 2021 Executive Committee meeting, Caroline Pinto, Managing Principal and Devan Sommerville, Associate VP at Counsel presented to the Executive Committee about the process. After discussion, the Executive Committee decided to bring the proposal to the open meeting to obtain feedback from the rest of Council. Meeting Date: September 22 , 2021 Issue: Government Relations Consultant Reported By: Ann Zeng Action: Discussion, Motion EXE CUTIVE Next Steps The Executive Committee with the support of Council to decide whether to proceed with Counsel Public Affairs Inc. to act for the College in acquiring public appointments and other potential government relations matters. EXECUTIVE Issue The College is providing an update on the 202 1 election of Council members for District 3 . Background On July 14, 2021, the College sent out the nomination package for the 2021 election of Council members for District 3. Two nomination packages were received for the three available seats on Council. As a result, Justin Wei-Kit Lee and Ryan Tze- Wai Longenec ker have been acclaimed to Council. As Council remains unconstituted, the newly acclaimed members will begin their term at the next regular Council meeting. Until then, the three Council members who currently hold their seats will continue their term. Th eir contribution and continued support are greatly appreciated. Meeting Date: September 22 , 202 1 Issue: Election Update Reported By: Ann Zeng Action: Information EXECUTIVE Issue A discussion on next steps for the Doctor Title Project. Background Since the completion of phase 1 of t he Doctor Title Project, phase 2 has been put on hold due to the Pandemic and the need for Council to appoint new members to the D r. Title Working Group. Since Council is unconstituted, the Executive Committee is able to make decisions on behalf of the Council; however, these decisions need to be confirmed by the Council once it has the necessary number of public members. Because of this, it was recommended that only urgent matters be decided on by the Executive Committee. Sta ff is bringing this item back for discussion on whether or not the appointment/reappointment of D r. Title Working Group members is an urgent matter that should be decided on despite the Council being unconstituted. At the last Registration Committee meeting, it was suggested that since the Dr. Title Project is related to the registration process, the Registration Committee could resume the work of the Doctor Title Project instead of appointing new members to the D r. Title Working Group. The Registration Committee currently consists of 4 professional members and only 2 public members (1 of which does not actively participate in committee work) . As public opinion is an important factor in the project, this is something the Executive Committee may want to take into consideration. Next Steps The Executive Committee to discuss the following options: a)To continue putting the Doctor Title Project on hold until Council is constituted to appoint new Dr. Title Working Group members b)The College to put out a call for interest to seek members for the Dr. Title Working Group. c)To have the work of the Dr. Title Working Group be resumed by the Registration CommitteeMeeting Date: September 22 , 2021 Subject : Dr. Title Working Group Reported By: Ann Zeng Action: Discussion , Direction EXECUTIVE Issue The College is updating Council on the current risk management plan, which includes a complete look at the risks facing the College. Public Interest Rationale The College must be able to carry out its responsibilities set out in legislation. In order to avoid situations where we are prevented from doing that, a risk management plan is necessary to predict and mitigate risks . Background The College provides Council with the risk management plan at each quarterly meeting, and staff will update members if there are any changes. For the September 22, 2021 meeting, staff have not identified any major ch anges to the risks facing the College, but have moved some additional treatments to current and added some proposed treatments based on the trends, best practices and the CPMF requirements.

Ryan Chu, An ia Walsh 2 September 2021 Risk Management Process and Activities The CTCMPAO regularly undertakes risk management activities to protect the interests of the public, its members and the Government of Ontario to which it is accountable. Risk management involves complex processes of risk assessment, development and implementation of mitigation strategies and evaluation of effectiveness, change and opportunity. Effective risk management requires the active engagement of everyone actively engaged in the organization and may include consultation with external experts such as auditors. The College adheres to a Risk Management Policy which requires regular review, evaluation and reporting to Council. Risk Analysis Matrix College staff engage in a collective and joint process to identify types of risks that are likely to affect the achievement of business goals. For each risk, staff consider what could happen, how and why it could happen, and the consequences of said risk. Staff systematically review the following to identify potential risks and to categorize potential risks using a risk occurren ce matrix: each function performed within the College, records and reports generated or retained by the College. business proc esses, policies and procedures. resources of the College including knowledge of history, processes and legislative, operational and policy environment, staff, furnishings and equipment. Types of Risk Identified: 1. Governance 2. Loss Confidence in CTCMPAO 3. Finance 4. Information Management 5. Facility/Site Safety and Security 6. Human Resources 7. Statutory Obligations 8. Exam 3 September 2021 Risk Occurrence Matrix Likelihood (probability of occurring) Consequence/ Impact Rare The event may occur in exceptional circumstances. (0 - 5 %) Unlikely The event has happened at some time. (6-33%) Possible The event has happened periodically (34-65%) Likely The event has happened previously and could reasonably occur again. (66-79%) Almost Certain The event is extremely likely to occur (80-100%) Level 1 2 3 4 5 Negligible Low financial /reputation loss, small impact on operations 1 1 2 3 4 5 Minor Some financial loss, moderate impact on business 2 2 4 6 8 10 Moderate Moderate financial loss, moderate loss of reputation, moderate business interruption 3 3 6 9 12 15 Major Major financial loss, several stakeholders raised concerns, major loss of reputation, major business interruption 4 4 8 12 16 20 Extreme Complete cessation of business, extreme financial loss, irreparable loss of reputation 5 5 10 15 20 25 Risk Rating Risk Priority Description 1-3 L Low Risk: May require consideration in any future changes to the work area or processes, or can be fixed immediately 3-6 M Medium Risk: May require corrective action, planning and budgeting process 4 September 2021 8-12 H High Risk: Requires immediate corrective action 15-25 E Extreme Risk: Requires immediate prohibition of the work, process and immediate corrective action Risk Assessment This step involved analysing the likelihood and consequences of each identified risk using the measures provided in the table above. The staff looked at the existing controls for each risk and identified what we would do to control the risk. Then, using the chart, they rated the effectiveness of existing controls in preventing the risk from happening or minimising its impact should it occur. Likelihood is a qualitative description of probability and frequency, asking the question 'what is the likelihood of the risk occurring?' Consequence was described as the outcome of the event, being a financial loss, loss of reputation, or business interruption, asking the question, 'what is the consequence of the risk event?' The risk rating was the sum of the consequence rating times the likelihood rating. The risk priority chart provides an indication of urgency to how soon the staff needed to implement a strategy to address the risk. 5 September 2021 CTCMPAO Risk Registry - 2019 - 2021 Risk Type Risk and Description Risk Likelihood Risk Impact Risk Priority Risk Owner Mitigation Actions Governance Not reaching quorum to constitute a Committee resulting in or Council becomes unconstituted : Public perception of not meeting College mandate of public protection Delays in decision - making affecting applicants (i.e. registration) or members (QA/ICRC/ Discipline) 5 Almost Certain 4 Major 20 Extreme Council, President, Registrar Current Treatment: Staff try to accommodate Council/committees members' schedules to ensure quorum in all meetings .

Background A survey was circulated with members of Council to obtain feedback on the College's current format of virtual meetings , and their level of comfort if in-person meetings were to be resumed . Bas ed on the majority of the survey results , the College has decided that it will continue its virtual meeting format into the foreseeable future. The College will reassess the situation at a later time to determine whether the feedback from Council members have ch anged since the completion of the survey.

The OPSDT replaces the Discipline Committee and has an armslength relationship with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (CPSO). The OPSDT is a neutral, independent, administrative tribunal that adjudicates allegations of professional misconduct or incom petence of Ontario physicians m ade by the CPSO. The Tribunal is made up of physicians, public members and hi ghlyexperienced adjudicators and holds hearings in a triallike process. The new website (www.opsdt.ca ) also launched today, and now host s the information about the Tr ibunal, legal resources, a hearings schedule and outcomes which were previously listed on the CPSO website. As part of our commitment to improving accessibi lity, I'm pleased to share tha t the new website launched in both English and French (www.tdmco.ca ). I want to give a special thank yo u to David Wright, Chair of th e Tribunal and his team who have worked especially hard these last few months to make this significant transition happen. The new independent Tri bunal is a positive step forward for the discipline proce ss in Ontario. I encourage you to visit the new site and familiarize yourself with the changes. I truly believe these c hanges will continue to ensure a fair, consistent and timely discipline process. Warm regards, Nancy Whitmore, MD, FRCSC, MBA Registrar and Chief Executive Officer 1 September 10, 2021 Dear Ms. Zeng , On April 1, 2021, the Office of the Fairness Commissioner (OFC) launched its new Risk -informed Compliance Framework (RICF). As we have communicated to regulators previously, the first year of the framework will serve as a transitional period during which the OFC will review the historical performance of each regulator and place them in a provisional compliance category. The next phase will involve the assignment of risk categories based on a more detailed analysis. For your information, the five historica l performance indicators that we will consider for the transitional period are: 1- The nature and extent of material compliance recommendations that the OFC has issued to the regulator in the last compliance cycle. 2- The extent to which the regulator ha s completed these recommendations and avoided new issues. 3- The regulator's observed motivation to work with the OFC on defined compliance objectives. 4- The content of decisions issued by the courts or tribunals that discuss the regulator's registration practices. 5- The degree to which the regulator's registration processes exhibit the attributes of transparency, objectivity, impartiality and fairness, as demonstrated, for example, by the number of OFC 2 recognized \"commendable practices\" and/or best practices and innovations that the regulator has instituted over time. Based on our review of how your organization has performed against these indicators, the OFC has determined that the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists should be assigned a \"full compli ance\" provisional rating. This means that the regulator has successfully implemented each of the compliance recommendations that the OFC has issued, additional recommendations were not identified, and other criteria have been met. For your information, and for comparative purposes, the provisional compliance categories that the OFC has allocated to the 39 regulators over which it has jurisdiction are as follows: Distribution of Compliance Categories among Regulators Compliance Category Number of Reg ulators in Category Full Compliance 32 Substantial Compliance 4 Falls Short of Compliance 3 Totals 39 In the Fall of this year, we will contact you again to gather information about forward -looking risk factors pertaining to the conduct of your registration processes. This information will allow us to allocate a risk 3 category to your organization once our Risk Informed Compliance Framework is fully in place. If you have any questions about the contents of this communication, please contact me at james .mendel@ontario.ca . Sincerely, James Mendel Compliance Analyst April 1, 2021 1 RISK -INFORMED COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK FREQUEN TLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 1. What is the effective date of the new Risk-informed Compliance Framework (RICF) and will there be a transition period to help regulators adjust ? The Office of the Fairness Commissioner (OFC) will launch its new RICF on April 1, 2021 , for an initial 12-month transition period . The new scheme will fully come into effect on April 1, 2022. During th e transition period, the OFC's assessment of a regulator's risk profile will be based predominantly on its historical performance. Individual regulator s will then be placed in provisional risk categ ories . The transition period w ill also provide an opportunity for those regulators with outstanding OFC recommendations to complete the changes necessary to meet these requirements . Finally, during this t ime frame , OFC staff will obtain information from regulator s on how the forward -looking risk factors , identified in the RICF , apply to the ir situations . 2. Why is the OFC implementing a new regulatory compliance framework? For the last few years, the OFC has signaled its intent to develop a RICF. A key objective underlying this scheme is to ensure that the Office's finite compliance resources are focused on those regulators that have not advanced as far as others in developing fair registration practices. To achieve this objective, the OFC has incorporated a number of modern regulator principles into its new compliance framework. The RICF has been specifically designed to achieve the following three outcomes: To enable regulators to more effectively comply with their legal obligations, and to ado pt associated best practices, in order to achieve better registration outcomes for all applicants. April 1 , 2021 2 To promote the identification of targeted risk factors to enable necessary mitigation and remediation efforts. To reduce unnecessary burdens on regulato rs and OFC staff, recognizing that all public sector organizations operate with constrained resources. 3. How did the OFC select the historical performance indicators and forward -looking risk factors that will apply to regulators? The OFC selected the se factors based on the experience that it has ga rnered since Ontario's fair access legislation was introduced in 2006, advice from subject -matter experts in the spheres of immigration, regulatory compliance and risk management, and the collective input received from regulators. The OFC has identified five specific measures to serve as historical perf ormance indicators . These are: 1. The nature and extent of material compliance recommen dations that the OFC has issued to the regulator in the last compliance cycle. 2. The extent to which the regulator has complied with these recommendations and avoided new issues. 3. The regulator's observed motivation to work with the OFC on defined complianc e objectives. 4. The content of decisions issued by the courts or tribunals that discuss the regulator's registration practices. 5. The degree to which the regulator's registration processes exhibit the attributes of transparency objectivity, impartiality and fairness, as demonstrated, for example, by the number of OFC recognized \"commendable practices\" and/or other best practices and innovations that the regulator has instituted over time. The five forward -looking risk factors focus on a regu lator's operating environment , stability, overall reliance on third party -service providers and policy considerations. April 1 , 2021 3 These factors pertain to : 1. Organizational Capacity . 2. The o verall control that a regulator exerts over its assessment and registration . processes. 3. The r esponse to emergency situations, such as the Covid -19 pandemic . 4. Over -reliance on Canadian experience requirements . 5. Public policy considerations , specifically: a. critical labour shortages of professionals or tradespersons that involve the regulator , and b. the need to apply inclusion and anti-racism approaches to the regulator's assessment and registration processes . 4. What are the risk categories under the new compliance framework? There are three risk categories into which a regulator may be placed according to its performance and risk profile. Low - those regulators whose performance constitutes full compliance with the objectives of fair access legislation and that exhibit a low risk profile. Moderately Low - those regulators whose performance constitutes substantial compliance with the objectives of fair access legislation and that exhibit a moderately low risk profile. Moderate to High - those regulators whose performance falls short of compliance with the objectives of fair access legislation and that exhibit a medium to high risk profile. 5. What methodology w ill the OFC employ to place regulators into discrete risk categories? In determining a regulat or's risk category, the OFC will employ a three -step process . It will: Step 1: Assess the historical performance of a regulator using the five indicators described above. April 1 , 2021 4 Step 2: Assess the forward -looking risk factors by determining the likelihood that each risk would occur and the impact of th at risk. Step 3: Determine the cumulative risk category by aggregating the results of the historical performance and forward -looking risk assessments. 6. How will the OFC ensure consistency in the application of risk categories, given t he diverse mandates and circu mstances of regulators? While the OFC will refine its risk assessment meth odology over time, notably during the first year of operation, the Office will strive to implement a consistent approach . This objective will be achieved by relying on evidence, focusing on relative performance across regulators and by instituting an internal review process. 7. What are the implications to a regulator if it is placed in the moderate to high compliance category ? The risk category attributed to a regulator will determine the relative degree of attention that the OFC applies to the regulator and the appropriate compliance activity or tool s used to either monitor the regulator's compliance or bring it to compliance. The nature and extent of these activities will be based on a compliance continuum. Those regulators that are in the low risk category will receive a \"light touch\". The OFC will reserve its more focused compliance processes (e.g., more frequent meetings, completion of an action plan , reports and/or audits) for those regulators that are placed in the moderate to high risk category. 8. How does a regulator move out of the moderate to high risk category into a lower one? The OFC's ultimate goal is for regulators to establish registration practices and processes that are transparent, objective, impartial and fair. The historical performance and forward -looking risk components of the framework provide insight on how regulat ors are meeting this general duty. Therefore, where a regulator makes progress in address ing its forward -looking risks, the OFC would consider whether the steps taken were sufficient to move the regulator down one or two risk categor ies. During the transi tion year, t he OFC will further refine this process and provide further information to regulators. April 1 , 2021 5 9. Will the regulator have the opportunity to dispute the risk category in which it is placed? How would that work? The OFC's approach to regulatory compliance will be based on transparency, professionalism and collaboration. The OFC welcome s collaborative dialogue with regulators on issues or concerns about their specific risk category. The OFC will consult with the regulators on a defini ng such a process. More information will be shared with the regulators at a future date. 10. What are the implication s for a regulator that is unable to implement its outstanding OFC recommendations during the transition period ? During the transition period, the OFC's Compliance Analysts w ill work with their regulators towards implementing any outstanding compliance recommendations. This period will provide the affected regulators with an opportunity to move to a different risk category. Towards the end of the transition period, the Compliance Analyst w ill re-assess the risk categor ization , in discussion with the regulator. This re -assessment would turn, to a large degree, on the extent to which the regulator has made progress in implementing any outstanding compliance recommendation s. On this basis, if a regulator is unable to make any meaningful changes , then the provisional performance compliance category ascribed to a regulator would be confirmed. 11. Will the OFC publ icly disclose the risk categories of individual regulators in its annual report or otherwise ? One of the OFC 's modern regulator principles is that the office strives to be an accountable regulator that it is prepared to justify its decisions and is open to pub lic scrutiny. The OFC may, therefore, decide to publicly disclose the risk categories of individual regulators , subject to any obligations contained in the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act . If such a decision is subsequ ently made , the OFC will notify the regulator s in question in advance of disclosure. It would not be the OFC's intention to provide such disclosures in the transitional phase of the scheme. 12. Will the OFC exercise its audit powers under this new framework? The province's f air access legislation affords the OFC with the authority to require a regulator to undergo an audit. The audit process is analogous to an independent investigation conducted by a qualified third-party service provider that the OFC approves. April 1 , 2021 6 Typically, such a process would constitute a defined and targeted review of material and persistent deficiencies in a regulator's registration processes. The audit would yield a report with findings and recommendations. Under the legislation, t he cost of the audit is borne by the regulator and the final report must be filed with the minister. Given the significant nature of the audit authority, and consistent with past practice, the OFC will employ this tool only when necessary. 13. Will the OFC modify its risk factors in the future? The OFC will review the relevance and appropriateness of its forward -looking risk factors on an annual basis. Any decision to modify the risk factors will go through a thoughtful analysis with appropriate consultation . 14. How will the OFC collect the information that it needs to populate its RICF ? In particular, will it need to modify the information that it now requests in its Fair Registration Practices Report (RPF) ? Under its current compliance framework, the OFC collects relevant information /data about a regulator's registration practices, challenges and accomplishments through various mechanisms, including the Fair Registration Practices (FRP) report , periodic meetings, the regulator's annual report, council minutes and a review of the organizati on's web site. During the transition period, t he OFC will review these processes to ensure that they align with the RICF. The OFC will then make a ppropriate modification s to the type and breadth of the data collected and the frequency of the process. These adjustments will be made to: ensure that the assessment of regulator risk categories is acc urate, inform the Office's strategic planning process and priorities , and facilitate the evaluation of program efficiency and effectiveness. 15.

Fixing Good Character Registration Requirements by Erica Richler Summer 2021 - No. 2581 As a general rule, regulators cannot discipline practitioners for conduct that occurred before they became registered: Association of Professional Engineers of Ontario v. Leung , 2018 ONSC 4527 (CanLII), https://canlii.ca/t/htl3k . One exception is where the applicant provided false information on their application for registration about their pre-registration conduct. However, the questions posed on the application form must then be clear and unambiguous before the regulator can act on a failure to disclose past examples of bad conduct: Payne v. Law Society of Upper Canada , 2014 ONSC 1083 (CanLII), https://canlii.ca/t/g6982 . Therefore it is important for regulators to screen for applicants whose past conduct suggests that they will act unprofessionally in the future. Regulators who fail to do so face considerable criticism. Even someone with good technical skills can cause significant damage through inappropriate, dishonest or abusive conduct: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article- the-good-doctor- its-time-to-stop-treating-character- like-an/. In the case of police officers, the evidence shows that officers who have had conduct issues in the past are much more likely to have additional complaints in the future when they move to a different jurisdiction: https://www.newyorker.com/news/us-journal/how- violent-cops-stay- in-law-enforcement . 1 This is a reprinted version of a paper published by the Canadian Network of Agencies of Regulation (CNAR) . However, in recent years, regulators have been criticized for imposing good character requirements that are misguided, ineffective, intrusive, unnecessarily traumatic and discriminatory. Misguided and Ineffective Many criticisms of good character registration requirements go back to the seminal article by Alice Woolley's on Tending the Bar: The \"Good Character\" Requirement for Law Society Admission : https://digitalcommons.schulichlaw.dal.ca/cgi/viewco ntent.cgi?article=1911&context=dlj (now Justice Woolley) . Alice Woolley argues that the conceptual foundation of the good character approach is flawed: Good character is thus defined not simply as a matter of moral behaviour, but also as a matter of having the virtues which will result in moral behaviour... It is impossible to prove that conduct flows from character, and some have argued that the assertion that it does is largely indefensible... [footnote omitted] To the social psychologist the overwhelming empirical evidence is that it is the circumstances of the lawyer's life\u2014 the pressures, culture and temptations of legal practice\u2014which will dictate the ethics of his practice. Page | 2 Alice Woolley also expressed significant concerns about how the good character process is administered: First, there is little consistency with respect to how past misconduct will be treated. Second, there is little consistency with respect to the significance which will be accorded to positive third party references about the applicant. Third, there is significant variation in how psychological evidence is used. Fourth, decisions often turn less on the evidence received about the applicant than on the panel's impression of the applicant as a witness during the proceeding. Finally, and perhaps most significantly, even when two cases present similarly on several evidentiary levels, inconsistent outcomes may be reached... Further, and more significantly, because law societies do not undertake independent investigation of applicants, there is no assurance that all applicants with issues arising from prior misconduct have been identified. Even a basic requirement that applicants provide a criminal record check, or a social services check, would significantly widen the scope of the law societies' inquiries. ... [The] investigation of potential applicants should reach beyond the simple self-reporting system currently used. Alice Woolley concludes: [T]he focus needs to be less on an applicant's \"character\" writ large than on her \"fitness\" for the ethical rigours of legal practice. Research in the United States suggests that past criminal findings are poor predictors of future professional misconduct: Levin, Leslie, \"Rethinking the Character and Fitness Inquiry\" (2014). Faculty Articles and Papers. 125, cited at: https://opencommons.uconn.edu/law_papers/125 . Intrusive, Unnecessarily Traumatic and Discriminatory The May 2021 article in Canadian Lawyer entitled Good character, bad predictor, for law societies cites Alice Woolley : https://www.canadianlawyermag.com/resources/profe ssional-regulation/good-character-bad-predictor-for- law-societies/356482 . The article goes further, suggesting that the good character questions asked of applicants are too broad. Amy Salyzyn, an associate professor at the University of Ottawa's faculty of law, says there is a lack of evidence that the \"good character\" process is even effective in protecting the public. \"If you look at the number of questions on the good character requirement form . . . it would be interesting to know what empirical evidence is behind [each] question,\" says Salyzyn. \"Because the connection between those questions and future concerns aren't always evident. I think it's a part of a broader need for law societies to engage in evidence-based regulation.\" Samantha Peters from the University of Ottawa law school raised the issue of the discriminatory impact of the good character requirements: \"I understand that the good character requirement is intended to protect the public and maintain high ethical standards in the profession,\" says Peters. \"But I think that the Page | 3 current process, as it stands, does not fully take into account the over-policing, wrongful convictions and criminalization of everyday movements of Black, Indigenous and criminalized folks.\" An earlier article in Canadian Lawyer by Naomi Sayers, an Indigenous lawyer, described the trauma of going through the good character screening process: https://www.canadianlawyermag.com/news/opinion/t he-trauma-of-proving- my-good-character/275404 . In an article published earlier this year, Andrew Flavelle Martin reviewed the case law and literature on regulators asking questions about applicants' mental health: Mental Illness and Professional Regulation: The Duty to Report a Fellow Lawyer to the Law Society | Alberta Law Review . Such questions may be presumptively discriminatory and need to be worded in such a way as to not to be overly inclusive, capturing medical histories that are unlikely to be relevant to the suitability to practise the profession. The CBC recently reported on a request for a regulator to reduce the kinds of good character information that applicants for regulation need to disclose because the questions are \"an intrusion of privacy .... [and] also deter members of marginalized groups from joining the legal profession ....\" https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba- lawyers-good-character-screening-1.5954198 In the United States there has been a concern that criminal records have unduly excluded people from occupations and professions, particularly racialized and marginalized individuals. Reforms are ongoing to reduce this barrier: https://ij.org/report/barred-from- working/; https://www.clearhq.org/page-1860709 . So What is a Regulator to do? These critiques are not entirely consistent. Some call for broader scrutiny of past conduct to identify possible concerns. Others call for more limited questions focused on the most relevant of conduct and which do not have discriminatory effect. However, even the strongest critics seem to see some sort of ongoing role for regulators to screen the past conduct of applicants for registration. As Alice Woolley states: Moreover, it is possible to imagine plausible but hypothetical cases ... in which maintenance of the character requirement seems essential. If, for example, a lawyer were to be disbarred by the Law Society of Alberta for misappropriation of client funds and then apply for admission to the Nova Scotia Barristers' Society, it is obvious that his admission should be denied on the basis of his character as evidenced by his disbarment. [footnote omitted] A good starting point for regulators is the leading case of Ontario (Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario) v. 751809 Ontario Inc. (Famous Flesh Gordon's), 2013 ONCA 157 (CanLII), https://canlii.ca/t/fwk8l . That case dealt with whether a member of the Hells Angels met the \"good character\" requirements to obtain a liquor licence. The learning points from that case include the following: The test in th at legislation did not even refer to \"good character\". Rather it took the more modern and relevant approach of asking whether the past conduct of the applicant afforded reasonable grounds for belief that the Page | 4 applicant will not carry on business in accordance with the law and with integrity and honesty. The regulator could look at any past conduct of the applicant, not just past conduct in the practice of the business or profession. The past conduct did not need to result in criminal findings. The analysis of the past conduct was for the sole purpose of assessing whether it was likely to affect the future conduct of the practitioner. Also, the standard of suitability based on anticipated future conduct is less generous to the applicant than the standard for removing someone from the profession who is already a member. That a practitioner has not been removed by their current regulatory body does not mean that another regulator has to register someone with a troubled practice history: Lum v Alberta Dental Association and College (Review Panel) , 2016 ABCA 154 (CanLII), https://canlii.ca/t/grmxn ; Nowoselsky v Saskatchewan Workers , 2015 SKQB 390 (CanLII), https://canlii.ca/t/gmn1w . See also the discussion by Rebecca Durcan about how Canadian regulators, generally, are analyzing the relevance of past conduct concerns, from whatever source, to the future professional behaviour of the applicant: https://www.clearhq.org/page-1860709 . Going beyond the guidance of the case law, regulators might consider the following: 1. The legislative test should be amended if necessary so that it is based on whether the past conduct of the applicant provides a reasonable 2 In some jurisdictions, human rights provisions limit scrutiny of offence records. Those restrictions need to be honoured. basis to believe that their future behaviour is likely to cause harm. 2. Even though the questions posed should not be limited to criminal conduct,2 they should be as objective as possible. For example, conduct that resulted in complaints, investigations, formal allegations, charges, tribunal findings or court findings might all be reportable. 3. The questions should capture concerns where consequences were avoided, for example, by resigning from a position or similar avoidance strategies. 4. Regulators should consider whether it is appropriate to obtain additional information beyond the applicant's self-declaration. For example, contacting prior regulators of applicants should probably be routine. Even better would be a searchable database shared with other regulators. Are internet searches appropriate? Should CanLII or other court and tribunal case databases be searched? Should criminal record checks be required? 5. The regulator should have a comprehensive published policy explaining in plain language the purpose of the registration conduct requirements, the process followed, and the considerations taken into account by the regulator. The policy should expressly address concerns about how disabilities will be accommodated and how the experience of individuals from marginalized groups will be taken into account. 6. Communications strategies should be developed to ensure that potential applicants learn of the expectations and processes early on in their education and training for entry into the Page | 5 profession. Posting a policy on the regulator's website may not be sufficient. 7. Special care must be taken in formulating the questions that will be asked about mental illness, addictions and historical conduct so as to comply with human rights obligations. 8. Regulators should carefully review their processes and language used in communicating with applicants where there are concerns, particularly where those concerns might be related to disabilities and past trauma. Fo r example, inviting the applicant to have a preliminary telephone call before receiving a formal letter requesting additional information may be appropriate in some cases. Perhaps the regulator can offer a resource person, who is not involved in the decision making, to communicate with the applicant, if desired. 9. Investigations into concerns should be planned and focused. Requiring an applicant to report on their entire life experiences may not be necessary or appropriate. 10. Both staff conducting investigations of prior conduct concerns and decision makers on whether the applicant's past conduct creates a risk of future harm should receive training. The training should not only cover the published criteria, but should also include awareness of the impact of disabilities, race and social disadvantages on creating reportable past conduct concerns. Regulators will continue to face competing demands in the assessment of prior conduct of applicants for registration. However, awareness of the issues should enable regulators to balance protection of the public with humane, legally defensible processes and relevant criteria.

Complaints Screening Criteria by Natasha Danson September 2021 - No. 259 What criteria should be used to screen complaints for a possible referr al to discipline? Decades ago most screening bodies simply referred a complaint where there was a prima facie case . Restated, the test was whether, if the evidence were believed, a finding could be made. Following the 1993 G. Arthur Martin report on charge screening in criminal cases, most screening bodies felt they could scrutinize the evidence somewhat to ensure that there was a reasonable prospect of a finding before making a referral. This represented a change from the previous test, permittin g screening bodies to do some weighing of the evidence. With the advent of educational and remedial alternatives to a referral to discipline , screening bodies began to consider a second criterion in addition to the strength of the evidence as part of the reformulated test: whether the allegations warranted a discipline hearing . See Re Matheson and College of Nurses of Ontario , 1980 CanLII 1614 (ON CA), https://canlii.ca/t/g1hzj . The Alberta Court of Appeal has recently conducted a detailed review of the criteria for referral to discipline in the context of police discipline cases in Conlin v Edmonton (City) Police Service , 2021 ABCA 287 (CanLII), https://canlii.ca/t/jhksl . The Conlin case involved a number of appeals of screening decisions made by the Chief of Police (the screening body under that legislation). The Court identified the primary issue before it of whether previous cases had conflated the two tests for assessing the evide nce (i.e., the evidence if believed test or the reasonable prospect of a finding test). The Court said that it was inappropriate to conflate the two tests. The proper reasonable prospect of a finding test ha s three components to it: (a) The test, overal l, is whether there is a \"reasonable prospect of establishing the facts necessary for a conviction\" at a hearing. This test only requires \"a reasonable basis in the evidence\" that would support a conviction, not that a conviction be probable or likely. The alternative formulation of the test in Land as being \"enough evidence that, if believed, could lead to conviction\" has turned out to be less helpful, and it should be avoided. (b) In performing this screening role, the chief of police is entitled to consider, as a whole, all of the evidence that has been gathered by the investigation, both direct and circumstantial, and inculpatory and exculpatory. While a limited weighing of the evidence is appropriate, the chief of police is not to determine if the charges are \"proven\", nor the comparative reliability of parts of the evidence. This limited weighing of the evidence can include an assessment of plausibility, reliability and credibility .... (c) ... The chief is entitled to take a realistic view of the evi dence using the lens of his experience with policing. The Court added, however, that this test does not mean that a \"he said, she said\" case should not be referred to a hearing. Even without corroboration, there could be a reasonable prospect of a finding : For example, a recurring scenario in sexual assault prosecutions is that the complainant testifies there was \"no consent\", whereas the accused testifies there was \"consent\". Since sexual assault tends to be a crime committed in private, there are rarely any independent Page | 2 witnesses or corroborating evidence on the issue of consent. Yet convictions result with some frequency in this situation. The explanation is simply that the complainant is believed at trial, and her evidence is of sufficient weight to all ow the Crown to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. That eventuality is what can show a reasonable prospect of conviction. At a hearing, the law does not require proof based on uncontradicted evidence.... While a chief of police is entitled to engage in some weighing of the evidence in performing the gatekeeping function, it would be an error for the chief to proceed on the assumption that complainants generally are not believable or that the evidence of the police officer will always be preferred. Su ch assumptions undermine the need to hold police officers to account for their conduct. The Court accepted that there was a second part of the screening process, namely whether the allegations were serious enough to warrant a discipline hearing: Further, the chief of police is entitled to consider the seriousness of the allegations, the need to maintain discipline within the police service, and the need to maintain the reputation of the police service. Some what perplexing was the Court's suggestion that this second part of the test could affect the first, reasonable prospect of a finding , test. One would think that the two parts of the test for referral should be applied independently. Another perplexing comment by the Court was reference to policy reasons for not holding a hearing even where there is a reasonable prospect of a finding: \"The \"policy reasons\" for not holding a hearing arise in 'unusual circumstances' \". It is unclear wheth er this comment relates to the second part of the test (whether a referral to discipline is warranted) or whether there is a third criterion where even serious allegations might not be referred to a hearing (e.g., compassionate grounds such as where the practitioner is seriously ill). Care should be taken in applying this case to professional regulators. The Court indicated that different considerations may apply because the Police Chief was not an external regulator and the police officers involved were employees, among other considerations. However, the emphasis on clarity of screening criteria should be relevant to all regulators. In addition, the breadth of the types of factors that should be taken into account when screening a complaint in police matters has analogies to other professions: In the policing context, the range of reasonable outcomes justified by the relevant constellation of law and facts anticipates consideration of the factors previously mentioned, including: the evidence uncovered in the investigation; the strength of the evidence; the validity or appropriateness of any explanation given by the police officer for the impugned conduct; the Chief of Police's experience as a police officer; the chief's knowledge of the police service and its policies; the Chief's general knowledge about policing standards; the seriousness of the allegations; the need to maintain discipline within the police service; the need to maintain the reputation of the police service; the over all context in which the events happened; the event itself; the complainant's and the police officer's perceptions of what occurred; and the perception that an objective observer would have of the events. Page | 3 While perhaps not providing the clarity a regulato r might desire, this case does contribute to the discussion. The case can be found at: https://canlii.ca/t/jhksl . June 28, 2021 Sean C ourt Assistant Deputy Minister Strategic Policy, Planning & French Language Services Division Ministry of Health 438 University Avenue, 10th floor Toronto ON M7A 2A5 Dear ADM Court: Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback on this important issue in healthcare regulation. Gov ernance has been a particular area of focus for CTCMPAO over the past several months, as CTCMPAO has contracted a third party, Governance Solutions Inc., to conduct a review of our governance practices and provide recommendations on how we can improve our practices and modernize. Governance Solutions delivered the governance report on June 14, 2021. The Executive Committee and \"Council\" initially discussed the governance report at the open Executive Committee meeting on June 22, 2021. The \"Council\" has not yet had a chance to fully consider the report and a decision as to which recommendations should be implemented has not yet occurred. However, in general CTCMPAO is supportive of measures to improve our efficiency and our ability to respond swiftly to emerging needs. Altho ugh CTCMPAO is in the preliminary stages of discussing governance modernization, we do have a number of requests that would assist us in thi s process and improve our governance practices. Counc il Vacancies Sinc e November of 2019, the Council of CTCMPAO has been without the requisite number of public appointees, and therefore unable to hold Council meetings, elections of officers and make major governance decisions. Despite conducting a governance review, receiving a governance review report, and holding discussions on how we would like to implement the recommendations set out in the report, because of the unconstituted Council, we are unable to proceed with making any changes. CTCMPAO believes that remaining unconstituted for prolonged periods harms a Council's ability to carry out its functions in public safety. While we continue to request additional public members be appointed to our Council, we additionally request legislative amendments to state that a Council remains properly constituted even when it has vacancies. This provision would allow Council to continue to fulfill its duty at all times. Competency -Based Selection Competency -based selection of Council and Committee members is a major recommendation of the governance review report submitted by our third- party consultants. In addition to this, the CPMF makes it clear that there is some expectation that colleges will begin to adopt competency- based selection for their councils and committees going forward. CTCMPAO asks that the ministry support this initiative through a legislative change that makes it clear that colleges can implement competency -based selection through their by -laws. CTCMPAO is further asking for a competency -based selection process to be implemented for public appointees, that is done transparently with each college. For a timelier process, please consider allowing colleges a more involved role in the appointments of public members. For example, if there is difficulty in finding a candidate, colleges could become involved in the recruitment of potential public members. Separation of Discipline/Fitness to Practice Decisions Another recommendation from the governance review report is to have adjudicative functions of the College be independent. A possible solution to this is a legislative change to remove this function from the College and placed in another entity. This change would improve the public confidence i n discipline and fitness to practice decisions, and ease a great deal of burden from the College in administering these Committees. In particular, it can be difficult in finding public representation to sit on panels, as we have a limited number of public members, and some will be conflicted from serving on the panel due to being involved in the earlier investigation of the matter. Increased Public Representation The governance review report recommends a public member to professional member ratio of 50/50 on its statutory committees. CTCMPAO further acknowledges that it is a trend nationally to increase the representation of the public in professional regulation. A legislative change to make the number of public appointees equal to the professional elected members of Council would enable us to have public members available to sit on statutory committees and improve the representation of the public in our decisions. Terminology CTCMPAO supports modernizing language in the legislation that defines our role more clearly. For example, the terms \"College\" and \"member\" can be replaced with \"Regulator\" and \"registrant\". We thank you again for the opportunity to provide feedback on this matter, and look forward to hearing more on governance improvements.
