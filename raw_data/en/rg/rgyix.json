SUMMARY OF ESTIMATES AND APPROPRIATIONS The following table compares on a summary basis the appropria- tions, including trust funds for fiscal year 2021, the budget request for fiscal year 2021, and the Committee recommendation for fiscal year 2021 in the accompanying bill. 2021 LABOR, HHS, EDUCATION BILL [Discretionary funding in thousands of dollars] Budget Activity Fiscal Year\u2014 2021 Committee compared to\u2014 2020 Enacted 2021 Budget 2021 Committee 2020 Enacted ......................... $12,413,848 $11,174,499 $12,667,501 SUMMARY OF THE BILL For fiscal year 2021, the Committee recommends a total of $182,914,000,000 in current year discretionary funding\u2014the 302(b) allocation\u2014and $196,546,000,000 in overall programmatic funding, including offsets and adjustments. The fiscal year 2021 rec-ommendation is an increase of $2,399,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. COVID -19 PANDEMIC The United States and the international community continue to respond to the deadly COVID-19 pandemic\u2014the worst public health crisis of the last century. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), between February 29 and June 30, the U.S. recorded more than 2.6 million cases of coronavirus and 127,000 deaths due to COVID-19. Moreover, those figures likely under count the true toll of the pandemic, due to a shortage of diagnostic testing since the virus began spreading across our communities in early 2020. Unfortunately, the Administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic has been inconsistent and incoherent. In a public health emergency, historically, the Federal response should be led by the CDC, the nation's foremost public health agen-cy, based on science and public health expertise. The Trump Ad-ministration, however, has sidelined the CDC and downplayed the recommendations of the world's foremost public health experts. In their place, the Administration has elevated non-expert views of political appointees in the White House. As a result, the Admin-istration did not develop a coordinated Federal strategy to contain the coronavirus, which has resulted in the worst response to the VerDate Sep 11 2014 05:16 Jul 08, the world's economically-advanced industri- alized nations. Other nations, from Germany to South Korea, applied rigorous public health guidelines to successfully contain the coronavirus. The U.S., on the other hand, deferred to political operatives and business leaders to focus on reopening economic activity without re-gard to public health. As a result, while nations such as New Zea-land and Japan have contained the coronavirus, the U.S. has suf-fered approximately one-quarter of COVID-19 deaths across the globe, despite having less than five percent of the global popu-lation. Congress demanded a national strategy for diagnostic testing and contact tracing to contain the virus and enable Americans to return to economic and social activities\u2014but the Administration deferred to States to take action. Despite the urgent need for fed-eral leadership, the Administration announced that States should develop their own testing plans and the federal government should be considered ''the supplier of last resort.'' In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the President abdicated all federal responsibility. As a result, the Administration's failed response cannot be defended from a public health perspective. But it did not have to be this way. Timeline In January, China confirmed its first known death caused by the novel coronavirus. Shortly thereafter, cases were identified in Japan, South Korea, Thailand, and the United States. By January 23, China closed down Wuhan, a city of 11 million people and the epicenter of the outbreak. On January 25, HHS Secretary Alex Azar notified the Committee that the CDC would begin to access funds in the Infectious Dis-eases Rapid Response Reserve Fund, which was first established in the fiscal year 2019 Labor-HHS Education Appropriations Act, to support public health preparedness and response activities. On January 30, the World Health Organization declared a ''pub- lic health emergency of international concern.'' The following day, the Administration imposed travel restrictions to prevent foreign nationals who had recently traveled to China from entering the United States. The evidence was becoming clear\u2014the U.S. needed to prepare for a serious public health crisis. On February 4, House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey and LHHS Subcommittee Chair Rosa DeLauro sent a letter to HHS Secretary Alex Azar, urging him to submit a request for emergency supplemental appropriations to prepare for this pub-lic health threat. Chairwoman Lowey and Chair DeLauro noted: ''It is clear, however, that further resources will be necessary to sup-port an aggressive and comprehensive government-wide response to the 2019 novel Coronavirus, both domestically and internation-ally.'' The Chairwomen urged the Secretary to submit an emergency supplemental request no later than February 10, including suffi-cient resources to support ''surveillance, epidemiology, and labora-tory capacity; enhanced screening at ports of entry; repatriation of U.S. nationals; mandatory quarantine of travelers; research, ad- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul procurement of medical countermeasures, including vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics; communications and public awareness; direct assistance to state and local public health departments, including through the Public Health Emer-gency Preparedness Cooperative Agreement and the Hospital Pre-paredness Program; and other activities to prevent, prepare for, or respond to the 2019 novel Coronavirus.'' In response, the Administration noted ''[it] is still early on in the response effort for the 2019-nCOV and we cannot predict with ac-curacy when [the Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund] will run out of funding, nor how the outbreak and our re-sponse needs will evolve.'' The Administration did not submit a re-quest for emergency supplemental appropriations until February 24\u2014at which point, the request was limited to $1,250,000,000 in new emergency funding, repurposing of $535,000,000 in emergency funding for Ebola, and transfers from other existing health pro-grams. On February 25, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, Director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, held a media briefing and presciently warned the country of the severity of the coronavirus outbreak. According to Dr. Messonnier, ''Ulti-mately, we expect we will see community spread in the United States. It's not a question of if this will happen, but when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe ill-nesses.'' She further noted, ''disruptions to everyday life may be se-vere'' and advised that Americans should begin to plan accordingly. According to credible media accounts, President Trump did not heed the warning of the CDC's foremost expert on respiratory dis-eases. Instead, the President was angry at Dr. Messonnier for up-setting the stock market. On February 25, in response to the CDC's warnings, Larry Kudlow, Director of the National Economic Council, told reporters, ''We have contained this. I won't say airtight, but pretty close to airtight.'' The following day, the President said, ''It's going to dis-appear. One day, it's like a miracle, it's going to disappear.'' Two weeks later, on March 11, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. On March 13, the President declared a state of national emergency under the Staf-ford Act and four days later, on March 17, the President encour-aged Americans to work from home, postpone unnecessary travel, and avoid gatherings of more than 10 people. At the time, in mid-March, there were fewer than 100 confirmed or presumed cases of COVID-19 in the United States. The country heeded the advice of public health experts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and to flatten the curve of the outbreak\u2014thereby re-ducing the peak number of hospitalizations, easing the strain on the health care system, and saving hundreds of thousands of Amer-ican lives. But the Trump Administration quickly reverted to its incon- sistent and incoherent response. By April and May, the Administration had essentially given up any attempt to mitigate or contain the COVID-19 pandemic. As more than 1,300 Americans died every day of COVID-19, and more than 23,000 Americans tested positive every day, the Administra-tion inexplicably shifted its attention to re-starting economic and VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul The White House urged States to reopen busi- nesses and the President urged Governors to dismantle public health measures. Public health leaders continued to express deep concerns about re-starting economic and social activities without sufficient testing, contact tracing, or quarantine capabilities. The CDC published guidance for schools, child care, employers with workers at high risk, restaurants and bars, and mass transit. The CDC advised against crowded indoor gatherings. Not a single State met the CDC's recommended thresholds for widespread reopening of activities. But the Administration urged States to reopen anyway. In the span of only two months\u2014April and May\u2014100,000 Ameri- cans died of COVID-19. In June, as States relaxed stay-at-home orders and reopened businesses, coronavirus cases in the U.S. surged by nearly 50 per-cent. The surge of new cases was led by States that reopened their economies most rapidly and aggressively. By the end of June, the U.S. reported a total of more than 125,000 deaths due to COVID- 19. On July 1, States reported more than 52,000 new cases, the high- est single-day total since the beginning of the pandemic. The new single-day peak lasted for 24 hours. On July 2, States reported more than 55,000 new cases. On July 3, States reported more than 57,000 new cases. Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Despite the Administration's inconsistent and incoherent re- sponse to the coronavirus pandemic, the Appropriations Committee has worked on a bipartisan basis since the beginning of the out-break. Since March 6, Congress has passed four emergency supple-mental appropriations packages, including more than $2,000,000,000,000 in emergency relief through the CARES Act. In addition, the House of Representatives passed the Heroes Act on May 15 to provide further emergency relief\u2014however, the Senate has thus far failed to vote on the bill. On March 4, the House of Representatives passed the first emer- gency supplemental appropriations bill, the Coronavirus Prepared-ness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act (P.L. 116- 123). The bill included a total of $8,300,000,000, including $6,100,000,000 through the Labor-HHS Education subcommittee\u2014 $2,200,000,000 for the CDC to support State and local pub- lic health departments, including for surveillance, laboratory testing, contact tracing, infection control; and mitigation; as well as global disease detection and emergency response; More than $3,000,000,000 for NIH and BARDA to support research and development of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics; and Nearly $1,000,000 for procurement of masks, personal pro- tective equipment, pharmaceuticals, and other medical sup-plies, as well as funding for Community Health Centers. On March 14, the House of Representatives passed the second emergency supplemental appropriations bill, the Families First VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, The bill included a total of $192,000,000,000, including $21,000,000,000 for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits and $50,000,000,000 to in-crease the Federal share of expenditures in the Medicaid and CHIP programs, as well as $1.25 billion through the Labor-HHS Edu-cation $1,000,000,000 to cover diagnostic testing for the unin- sured. On March 27, the House of Representatives passed the third emergency supplemental appropriations bill, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Emergency Security Act (CARES Act) (P.L. 116-136). The bill included more than $2,000,000,000,000 in emergency re-lief, including direct payments to households, enhanced unemploy-ment compensation, and emergency assistance for state and local governments, small businesses, and corporation. The CARES Act included $172,000,000,000 in emergency supplemental appropria-tions through the Labor-HHS Education subcommittee\u2014 $100,000,000,000 for health care providers to cover health care expenses or lost revenues attributable to the coronavirus; $27,000,000,000 for the Assistant Secretary for Prepared- ness and Response, including $16,000,000,000 for the Strategic National Stockpile and at least $3,500,000,000 for additional advanced research and development of vaccines and thera-peutics; $4,300,000,000 for the CDC to support State and local pub- lic health departments, including for surveillance, laboratory testing, contact tracing, infection control; and mitigation; as well as global disease detection and emergency response; $945,000,000 for NIH to expand research on COVID-19; $425,000,000 for mental health and substance abuse pre- vention and treatment activities at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA); $200,000,000 for CMS to assist nursing homes with infec- tion control and support States' efforts to prevent the spread of coronavirus in nursing homes; $6,300,000,000 for the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), supporting child care for essential workers in-cluding healthcare workers and first responders, Head Start, and grants to States for community and social services, home energy assistance, child welfare services, runaway and home-less youth, and family violence prevention services; $955,000,000 for the Administration for Community Living (ACL) to support nutrition programs, home- and community- based services, support for family caregivers, and expand over-sight and protections for seniors and individuals with disabil-ities; VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul the Health Resources and Services Ad- ministration, including funding for rural hospitals, expansion of telehealth services, and Ryan White HIV/AIDS programs; $30,900,000,000 for the Department of Education to assist students, school districts, institutions of higher education and States with immediate needs related to the coronavirus; $360,000,000 for the Department of Labor, including $345,000,000 for States and communities to respond to work-force impacts and layoffs resulting from the coronavirus through the Dislocated Worker National Reserve; $338,000,000 for the Social Security Administration to support essential telework, communication needs, and salaries and benefits of Federal employees impacted by office closures, and for the purposes of issuing emergency assistance Economic Impact Payments; $75,000,000 for stabilization grants through the Corpora- tion for Public Broadcasting to maintain programming services and to preserve small and rural public telecommunication sta-tions; $50,000,000 for digital access and technical support serv- ices through the Institute for Museum and Library Services; and $5,000,000 for the Railroad Retirement Board to support telework and administer the Railroad Unemployment Insur-ance Act. On April 23, the House of Representatives passed the fourth emergency supplemental appropriations bill, the Paycheck Protec-tion Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (P.L. 116-139). The bill included nearly $500,000,000,000 in emergency relief, in-cluding $100,000,000,000 through the Labor-HHS Education sub-committee\u2014 $75,000,000,000 for the Health Care Provider Relief Fund; and $25,000,000,000 to support increased diagnostic testing and contact tracing across the United States. On May 15, the House of Representatives passed the Heroes Act (H.R. 6800). The bill includes more than $3,000,000,000,000 in emergency relief for American families, workers, and businesses, as well as ongoing emergency response activities, including nearly $200,000,000,000 through the Labor-HHS Education sub-committee\u2014 $100,000,000,000 for the Health Care Provider Relief Fund; $75,000,000,000 to support increased diagnostic testing and contact tracing; $7,600,000,000 for Community Health Centers; $2,100,000,000 for the CDC to support State and local pub- lic health agencies; VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 for NIH to expand research on COVID-19, as well as support research projects interrupted by the pan-demic; $4,500,000,000 for BARDA for additional advanced re- search and development of vaccines and therapeutics; $10,100,000,000 for the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), including $7,000,000,000 in Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) funding to States, $3,000,000,000 in home energy and water bill assistance to low income households, and additional funding for family violence and child abuse prevention services; $100,000,000,000 to provide direct services such as home- delivered and pre-packaged meals, and supportive services for seniors and disabled individuals and their caregivers through the Administration for Community Living (ACL); $100,200,000,000 to support the educational needs of stu- dents, school districts, institutions of higher education and States in response to the coronavirus, including $90,000,000,000 through a State Fiscal Stabilization Fund to support statewide and local funding for elementary and sec-ondary schools and public postsecondary institutions and $10,200,000,000 for private colleges and Minority Serving In-stitutions; $2,000,000,000 through the Department of Labor to sup- port workforce training, including through remote access, and providing emergency supportive services for migrant and sea-sonal workers; $940,000,000,000 to support the Unemployment Insurance system, including funds to speed the payment of benefits and assist States in processing claims; $107,000,000 for worker protection activities, including ad- ditional enforcement of standards and directives at slaughter-houses, poultry processing plants, and agricultural workplaces, and outreach to workers to make them aware of their rights to paid family and medical leave and paid sick leave; $5,000,000 to support libraries and museums with costs and expenses associated with the coronavirus; and $5,000,000 for the Railroad Retirement Board to support the processing of unemployment benefits under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. In March and April, the Labor-HHS Education subcommittee provided a total of $279,500,000,000 in emergency appropriations to protect the health and safety of Americans and to help Ameri-cans families and businesses to recover. Oversight of the Administration's Response to COVID-19 Since the beginning of February, the Labor-HHS Education sub- committee has held nine subcommittee hearings or bipartisan briefings on the topic of COVID-19, including hearings and brief-ings with senior HHS officials as well as hearings and briefings with non-governmental public health experts. The Subcommittee VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, intends to hold additional oversight hearings through the rest of this Congress. On February 12, the Subcommittee held a bipartisan briefing to examine HHS's response to the coronavirus. The briefing was led by Dr. Nancy Messonnier, Director of CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; Dr. Anthony Fauci, Direc-tor of NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; and Dr. Robert Kadlec, Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. These HHS officials outlined the Department's prepared-ness and response activities, including efforts to assist in repa-triating U.S. nationals from China, as well as screening and quar-antine operations at ports of entry. Dr. Fauci and Dr. Kadlec also provided an overview of early efforts to develop medical counter-measures for the coronavirus, including vaccines and therapeutics. On March 10, the Subcommittee held a hearing with the CDC to examine the agency's 2021 budget request. Witnesses included Dr. Robert Redfield, Director of the CDC; Dr. Ileana Arias, Associate Deputy Director for Public Health Science and Surveillance; Dr. Debra Houry, Director of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; and Ms. Sherri Berger, Chief Strategy Officer and Chief Operating Officer. The Subcommittee held the hearing one week after Congress passed the first emergency supplemental ap-propriations package, including $2.2 billion for the CDC, and fo-cused on CDC's COVID-19 response activities, including the delay in producing diagnostic test kits, as well as the recent transition from a strategy of containment of the coronavirus to a strategy of mitigation (including social distancing). On April 15, the Subcommittee held a bipartisan briefing for full committee members with HHS Secretary Alex Azar to examine the Department of Health and Human Services' plans to allocate $100,000,000,000 in emergency relief\u2014enacted in the CARES Act on March 27\u2014to hospitals, health care providers, and other entities for their health-related expenses and lost revenues due to the coronavirus. The briefing focused on how the Department would disseminate emergency funding quickly to health care providers, including to hospitals and other providers in areas most directly af-fected by the COVID-19 pandemic. On April 16, the Subcommittee held a bipartisan briefing for full committee members to examine the Department of Education's im-plementation of CARES Act funding. The briefing was led by James Blew, Assistant Secretary for Planning, Evaluation and Pol-icy Development; Robert King, Assistant Secretary for Postsec-ondary Education; Frank Brogan, Assistant Secretary for Elemen-tary and Secondary Education; and, Diane Jones, Principal Deputy Under Secretary, Delegated the Duties of the Under Secretary. In the winter and spring of 2020, school buildings, campuses and li-braries physically closed, and social and economic services that stu-dents and their families rely upon were disrupted or ceased en-tirely. In response, Congress passed the CARES Act to provide vital resources to assist students whose educations have been dis-rupted. During the briefing, members had an opportunity to ask questions of Department officials about the Secretary's timeline for distributing aid. Unfortunately, details regarding the Secretary's implementation of key provisions of the law that are in contraven-tion of both the plain reading of the statute and the intent of Con- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, omitted during the briefing. And to date, the Depart- ment has issued conflicting and confusing guidance, which has re-sulted in the delay of assistance to students, families and institu-tions in need. As such, the Heroes Act takes steps to provide fur-ther relief and reassert Congressional intent. On May 1, the Subcommittee held a bipartisan briefing for full committee members with Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former FDA Commis-sioner, to discuss recommendations for the conditions that would be necessary to re-start economic and social activities during the pan-demic. Dr. Gottlieb outlined recommendations in a recent report by the American Enterprise Institute, A Road Map to Reopening , that he co-authored with Dr. Caitlin Rivers, Dr. Mark McClellan, Lauren Silvis, and Dr. Crystal Watson. The briefing focused on im-provements in state and local capacity that would be necessary to slow community transition of COVID-19 before local communities could safely reopen. On May 6, the Subcommittee held a hearing with two public health experts, Dr. Tom Frieden and Dr. Caitlin Rivers, to examine the necessary public health measures to respond to COVID-19, in-cluding surveillance, diagnostic testing, contact tracing, quarantine, social distancing, production and distribution of personal protective equipment, medical surge and health care resiliency, development of vaccines and therapeutics, and long-term investments in public health preparedness and response activities\u2014including state and local health departments, public health laboratories, public health data modernization, public health workforce, and global disease de-tection and response. On June 4, the Subcommittee held a hearing with Dr. Robert Redfield, Director of the CDC, to examine the Administration's in-consistent and incoherent response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While the CDC had issued guidance for re-starting economic and social activities, many States were already moving forward with ac-tivities despite failing to meet the CDC's recommended criteria. The hearing focused on the Administration's efforts to sideline the CDC, the nation's foremost public health agency, in favor of non- expert guidance from political appointees in the White House. On June 11, the Subcommittee held a bipartisan briefing for full committee members with Dr. Ashish Jha, Professor of Global Health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Di-rector of the Harvard Global Health Institute, to examine the ongo-ing Federal response to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly as the number of cases were increasing in many States and the U.S. continued to record as many as 800-1,000 deaths on a daily basis. The briefing focused on the projected course of the pandemic over subsequent months, including a likely worsening of the outbreak in the Fall and Winter months until a successful therapeutic or vac-cine is widely available, as well as the need for the Administration to take a leadership role in responding to the pandemic. On June 22, the Subcommittee held a bipartisan briefing with Randi Weingarten, President of the American Federation of Teach-ers to discuss reopening schools safely, preventing State and local layoffs, and addressing learning loss among our most at-risk stu-dents. In particular, Members discussed the affects of ongoing trau-ma and mental health issues, how adverse childhood experiences impede and even prevent learning and the importance of trauma- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul informed care and services. The briefing also included a discussion on the importance of appropriate personal protective equipment for students and employees, including the availability of and training on how to effectively use it.

TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICES Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $3,611,200,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 3,358,304,000 ............................................................. 3,696,700,000 Change from ......................................................... +85,500,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +338,396,000 Training and Employment Services provides funding for Federal job training programs authorized primarily by the Workforce Inno-vation and Opportunity Act of 2014 (WIOA). The Committee recommendation includes new bill language al- lowing the Secretary to waive certain requirements to permit the outlying areas to submit a single application for a consolidated grant. Adult Employment and Training Activities. \u2014For Adult Employ- ment and Training Activities, the Committee recommends $864,649,000, which is $10,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Youth Employment and Training Activities. \u2014For Youth Employ- ment and Training Activities, the Committee recommends $925,130,000, which is $12,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The Committee is concerned that many 16-24 year-olds seeking employment are unable to find jobs due to limited access to re-sources and networks. This inability is worsened by racial dispari-ties, especially in urban areas. The Committee directs the Sec-retary to include an update in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification on youth unemployment, including the num-ber of unemployed youth ages 16-24, disaggregated by race, socio-economic status, and age, as well as the disparities such youth face in seeking and obtaining employment. This update must also in-clude information on youth unemployment by industry and sector, including Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM), as well as entrepreneurship. In addition, the Committee directs the Secretary to include recommendations on actions Congress can take to ensure that youth unemployment decreases. In addition to the challenges posed by youth unemployment, the Committee recognizes that participation in work-based learning VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul during high school can have a positive impact on students that may lead to sustained employment and higher-quality jobs. Therefore, the Committee urges the Department to encourage local secondary educational authorities with expertise in work-based learning to be included as part of the required education and training organiza-tion representatives on local workforce development boards to pro-vide guidance on work experience, including summer employment opportunities for youth. Dislocated Worker Employment and Training Activities. \u2014For Dislocated Worker Employment and Training Activities, the Com-mittee recommends $1,080,053,000, which is $28,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Dislocated Worker Assistance National Reserve. \u2014The Committee recommends $280,859,000 for the Dislocated Workers National Re-serve, an increase of $10,000,000 over the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $120,000,000 over the fiscal year 2021 budget request. In addition, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) (P.L. 116-136) included $345,000,000 for the Dis-located Worker National Reserve for States and communities to help address workforce-related impacts of COVID-19. The Committee recommendation includes $50,000,000, an in- crease of $10,000,000 over the fiscal year 2020 enacted level, for Strengthening Community College Training Grants to support a new grant competition. This funding will continue to help better align workforce development efforts with postsecondary education and build off lessons learned from the Trade Adjustment Assist-ance Community College and Career Training Grant program. The fiscal year 2021 budget request did not include funding for this pro-gram. The Committee is deeply troubled by the Department's failure to follow the requirements for this program as laid out in the Depart-ment of Labor Appropriations Act, 2020. This legislation included language requiring the Department to ''follow the requirements for the program in House Report 116-62,'' which included a require-ment that the solicitation for grant applications (SGA) be issued within 120 days of enactment of that Act. As such, this require-ment was incorporated by reference into the appropriations meas-ure and had the same legal effect as the legislation itself. To date, the Department has not issued an SGA, thereby failing to follow the requirements for this program. Coupled with the ETA's misuse of registered apprenticeship funds, the Committee notices a con-cerning trend within ETA regarding proper execution of the law and is disappointed ETA continues to disregard Congressional in-tent. The Committee recommendation continues to direct the De-partment to follow the program requirements as laid out in House Report 116-62 and includes new bill language requiring ETA to issue an SGA within 120 days of enactment of this Act. The Com-mittee recommendation includes new bill language reducing the Department's Executive Direction budget by $100,000 for each day the SGA is not issued beyond the 120 day requirement. The Committee includes $10,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level, for grants to support national out-of-school time organizations that serve youth and teens and place an emphasis on age-appropriate workforce readiness programming to expand job VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, and workforce pathways for youth and disconnected youth, including soft skill development, career exploration, job readiness and certification, summer jobs, year-round job opportunities, and registered apprenticeships. Funding will also support partnerships between workforce investment boards and youth serving organiza-tions. The fiscal year 2021 budget request did not include funding for this initiative. Native Americans. \u2014For the Indian and Native American pro- grams, the Committee recommends $55,500,000, which is $500,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request proposes to eliminate this program. Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers. \u2014For the National Farm- worker Jobs program, the Committee recommends $95,896,000, which is $4,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request proposes to eliminate this pro-gram. The Committee recognizes that grantee performance may suffer as a result of the coronavirus, leading to lower performance meas-ures in the future. Accordingly, the Committee encourages the Sec-retary to take into account the effects of the coronavirus outbreak on performance. Moreover, the recommendation includes new bill language adjusting the definition of ''low-income'' for purposes of this program. YouthBuild. \u2014For the YouthBuild program, the Committee rec- ommends $100,534,000, which is $6,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $16,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Reintegration of Ex-Offenders. \u2014The Committee recommends $103,079,000 for training and reintegration activities for individ-uals with criminal records or who have been justice system-in-volved, which is $5,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $10,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 budget re-quest. The Committee directs the Department to ensure grantees establish formal partnerships with employers and that program participants receive industry recognized credentials and training in fields that prepare them for successful reintegration, including en-suring participants receive training and credentials in fields where their record is not a barrier to entry or continued employment. The Committee also directs the Department to consider the needs of communities that have recently experienced significant unrest. The Committee also continues the set-aside of $25,000,000 for competitive grants to national and regional intermediaries for ac-tivities that prepare for employment young adults with criminal records or who have been justice system-involved or who have dropped out of school or other educational programs, with a pri-ority for projects serving high-crime, high-poverty areas. The Com-mittee directs the Department to consult data from the Department of Education and prioritize grants in communities where students of color have disproportionate rates of expulsions and suspensions. The Committee is aware that recent re-entry programs are an excellent way to help address workforce challenges, including those in the advanced manufacturing sector. The Committee directs the Department to provide an update in the fiscal year 2022 Congres-sional Budget Justification on information from the last three fiscal years on pathways and relationships built with employers, includ- VerDate Sep 11 2014 05:16 Jul ing data on formerly incarcerated individuals who have utilized the program, rates of increased credentials, and placement in higher paying positions. The Committee also directs the Department to provide a briefing to the Committees on Appropriations within 180 days of enactment of this Act on such information. Workforce Data Quality Initiative. \u2014The Committee recommends $6,000,000 for the Workforce Data Quality Initiative, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request proposes to eliminate this program. The Committee supports the work of States in using these funds to create and uti-lize data to align preschool through workforce systems. Apprenticeship Grants. \u2014The Committee recommends $185,000,000 for the apprenticeship grants program, which is $10,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $15,000,000 below than the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The Committee established this program in 2016 to expand work-based learning programs in in-demand industries through registered ap-prenticeships. Registered apprenticeships are a proven strategy for meeting the needs of our nation's workforce and industry simulta-neously. The Committee continues to invest in expanding opportunities relating to Registered Apprenticeship programs registered only under the National Apprenticeship Act, to be available to the Sec-retary to carry out activities through grants, cooperative agree-ments, contracts and other arrangements with States and other ap-propriate entities. As part of these opportunities, the Committee di-rects the Secretary to continue funding for national and local ap-prenticeship intermediaries, business and labor industry partner intermediaries, and equity intermediaries. The Committee also di-rects the Department to ensure that these intermediaries are given opportunities to apply for competitive grants, cooperative agree-ments, contracts, and other funding opportunities. The Committee urges the Secretary to ensure that States engage both business and labor as part of any State funding opportunities associated with this program. In addition, the Committee continues to support the funding and development of industry or sector partnerships as a means to expand work-based learning programs and registered ap-prenticeships in in-demand industries. The Committee directs the Secretary to submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations providing details on entities award-ed funding, selection criteria used, and the funding amount for each grant or contract awarded at the time such awards are made. Not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, the Department shall provide the Committees on Appropriations a detailed spend plan of anticipated uses of funds made available, including admin-istrative costs. The Committee is deeply concerned by the Industry Recognized Apprenticeship Program (IRAP) final rule as published in the Fed-eral Register on March 11, 2020 (85 Fed. Reg. 14,294), entitled ''Apprenticeship Programs, Labor Standards for Registration, Amendment of Regulations.'' The Committee maintains that IRAPs are a duplicative apprenticeship model that wastes not only tax-payer dollars, but Federal resources and staff capacity at the De-partment. Therefore, the Committee includes a new bill-wide provi-sion defining ''apprenticeship'' and ''apprenticeship program'' as an 11 2014 program registered under the National Apprentice- ship Act, including any requirement, standard, or rule promulgated under such Act as was in effect on December 30, 2019. The Com-mittee directs the Secretary to submit a report, not later than 90 days after the enactment of this Act, to the Committees on Appro-priations on the implementation of the rule and any impact on Reg-istered Apprenticeship programs. Such a report shall include, but not be limited to: a list of all entities awarded funding through grants or contracts related to the development or execution of IRAPs during fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020, including the funding amounts from Program Administration, H-1B fees, and all other sources derived; a list of all entities recognized or under con-sideration for recognition as Standards and Recognition Entities (SREs); a list of all IRAPs approved or seeking approval and the SREs for those programs recognized under the rule; an analysis of the starting wages and expected pay increases for apprentices in IRAPs and the portability of the credentials offered by the pro-grams; the number of Departmental full-time equivalent employees dedicated solely to the Registered Apprenticeship program, and a list of any applications submitted under the rule. The report shall also include an accounting of all funds used for implementing or supporting IRAPs or awarded through grants or contracts under this rule since the date of the Executive Order issued on June 15, 2017, entitled Expanding Apprenticeships in America through the end of fiscal year 2020, including any funds used from Program Ad-ministration, any grant programs under ETA, or H1-B fees. The Committee also directs the Department to provide a detailed report within 90 days of enactment of this Act, outlining specific steps the Department will take towards effective oversight of the IRAP system, including monitoring conflicts of interests between SREs and program operators, the finances of SREs and any fees charged to program operators for recognition by the SRE, and any violations of civil rights laws or non-compliance with Equal Em-ployment Opportunity regulations and guidelines. The Committee strongly supports efforts to expand Registered Apprenticeships to traditionally underrepresented communities and encourages the Department to explore the feasibility and expansion of Registered Apprenticeship programs within the arts, theater, film, and television industries. Specifically, the Committee requests that the Department explore expanding the Registered Apprentice-ship model to create career training strategies for all roles in the entertainment industry such as creative, production, technical, marketing and public relations roles. In addition, the Committee notes that apprenticeships are an im- portant path to the middle-class, with those completing a program earning an average annual income of $70,000. However, women are largely underrepresented in apprenticeship programs, and women who do participate make far less than men. Therefore, the Com-mittee directs the Department to accelerate efforts to recruit and retain women as part of these programs and to ensure equal com-pensation. The Committee is concerned about shortages nationwide of quali- fied drinking water and wastewater operation professionals, espe-cially in rural areas, and encourages the Secretary to make funding available to address these challenges. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, The Committee also supports the use of apprenticeship grants that provide worker education based on public-private partnerships in in-demand fields, including first responder, utility (water), as well as in goods movement sectors such as global logistics, rail and other freight-related employment. The Committee encourages the Department to support appren- ticeship programs that increase the number of trained workers in cybersecurity. JOB CORPS Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $1,743,655,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 1,015,897,000 ............................................................. 1,755,655,000 Change from ......................................................... +12,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +739,758,000 Job Corps is the nation's largest residential employment and workforce development program for youth, helping prepare thou-sands of young people ages 16 through 24 for jobs in in-demand oc-cupations with good wages each year. Operations. \u2014For Job Corps Operations, the Committee rec- ommends $1,603,325,000, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $719,991,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Construction, Rehabilitation, and Acquisition. \u2014The Committee recommends $120,000,000 for construction, rehabilitation, and ac-quisition activities of Job Corps centers, which is $12,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $19,984,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Administration. \u2014The Committee recommends $32,330,000 for the administrative expenses of the Job Corps program, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $217,000 less than the fiscal year 2021 budget request. For over 50 years, Job Corps has successfully educated and trained millions of young adults for jobs in high demand industries and trades. Job Corps has campuses across all 50 States and Puer-to Rico and provides a safe living, learning and disciplined residen-tial setting that allows disconnected and opportunity youth to gain the employment and skills that U.S. employers seek. The Com-mittee recommendation includes funding for Job Corps to meet ca-pacity and ensure a safe learning environment for all students and staff, including to train youth for employment in industry sectors facing critical shortages of skilled workers, such as construction, healthcare, manufacturing, transportation, and cyber technologies. Job Corps centers are capable of serving approximately 50,000 out- of-work and out-of-school youth each year, and the Committee en-courages the Department to use such funding accordingly. In addition, the Committee is concerned with the administration of the Job Corps program, including the underutilization of centers relative to on-board strength, industry-standard training, and per-formance incentives. The Committee directs the Department to submit a report, within 90 days of enactment of this Act, on obliga-tions, outlays, and unobligated funds for the current fiscal year and the most recent fiscal year to the Committees on Appropriations. To better utilize Job Corps centers, the Committee directs the De-partment to include an update in the fiscal year 2022 Congres- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 on specific outreach and admissions ef- forts, the most recent geographic assignment plan required by Sec. 145(c) of the WIOA, and an analysis of Job Corps application and enrollment data to evaluate the relative efficacy of different invest-ments in producing Job Corps-eligible applicants, arrivals, and their families, including social media, national television or radio buys, and local outreach efforts targeted at eligible youth, guard-ians, and influencers. The Committee encourages the Department to hire additional Outreach and Admissions staff to increase re-cruitment efforts targeted at disconnected youth in large cities and rural areas. The Committee directs the Department to provide a briefing to the Committee on Appropriations within 120 days of en-actment of this Act on efforts to responsibly increase onboard strength and training slot capacity. Moreover, the Committee urges the Department to suspend plans to eliminate programs based upon the 85-90 percent On-Board Strength/Career Technical Training range. The Committee supports the Department's intention to make in- vestments in Job Corps facilities to ''support high-quality training that meets existing industry standards.'' Therefore, the Committee requests additional information in the fiscal year 2022 Congres-sional Budget Justification on the cost of modernizing Job Corps centers' trade offerings, curricula, and equipment to meet existing industry standards. This information is of particular interest given the realignment of Job Corps center recruitment and placement with local workforce development areas through the National En-rollee Assignment Plan. The Department states that Job Corps' existing model incentivizes continuous performance improvement while the transi-tion to fixed price contracts is expected to yield cost savings. The Committee is concerned that the current implementation of this transition may shift Job Corps' focus from student outcomes to cost savings. Within 90 days of enactment of this Act, the Committee requests detailed information regarding how the Department will assess which Job Corps proposals will provide the best value, spe-cifically with respect to student outcomes. In addition, the Com-mittee requests information on options for incorporating perform-ance-based incentives into Job Corps' fixed price contracts in order to ensure student outcomes are the highest priority, including a timeline for implementation, in its fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification. COMMUNITY SERVICE EMPLOYMENT FOR OLDER AMERICANS Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $405,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... - - - Committee Recommendation ............................................................. 410,000,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +5,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +410,000,000 The Community Service Employment for Older Americans pro- gram provides grants to public and private non-profit organizations that subsidize part-time work in community service activities for unemployed persons aged 55 and older whose family income is below 125 percent of the poverty level. The Committee recommends $410,000,000 for the Community Service Employment for Older Americans program, which is VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request proposes to eliminate this program. FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND ALLOWANCES Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $680,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 633,600,000 ............................................................. 633,600,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... \u00a546,400,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - The Trade Adjustment Assistance program (TAA) provides as- sistance to workers adversely affected by international trade. TAA provides training, income support, wage subsidies for older work-ers, job search and relocation allowances to groups of workers who file a petition and are certified as eligible to apply for such benefits due to job losses resulting from increases in imports or foreign trade. The mandatory funding provided for this program is dependent upon the Administration's economic assumptions, and the Commit-tee's recommendation for fiscal year 2021 is lower than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level for this reason. STATE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICE OPERATIONS Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $3,374,649,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 3,497,280,000 ............................................................. 3,506,019,000 Change from ......................................................... +131,370,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +8,739,000 The total includes $3,421,953,000 from the Employment Security Administration Account from the Unemployment Trust Fund and $84,066,000 from the General Fund of the Treasury. These funds are used to support the administration of Federal and State unem-ployment compensation laws. Unemployment Insurance Compensation. \u2014For Unemployment In- surance(UI) Compensation, the Committee recommends $2,649,686,000, which is $108,870,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $3,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The recommendation provides additional resources for States to increase staffing capacity and to accommodate sus-tained increases in workload. In addition, the recommendation provides contingency funding for increased workloads that States may face in the administration of UI. The Committee recommendation includes bill language so that, during fiscal year 2021, for every 100,000 increase in the total average weekly insured unemployment (AWIU) above 1,728,000, an additional $28,600,000 shall be made available to States from the Unemployment Trust Fund. Under current economic conditions, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that this will result in an additional $925,000,000 to flow to States. In the event that additional funds are provided to States under the AWIU contingency authority, the Department is directed to provide notification to the Committees on Appropriations of the current projected AWIU level for the fiscal year, when funds were provided to States, and how much additional funding was provided in total and to each State within 15 days of funding being provided. In the event that additional funds are provided on a quarterly VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, basis, the Department shall provide this information on a quarterly basis. The Committee includes $117,000,000 for the Reemployment Services and Eligibility Assessments program, and an additional $83,000,000 is made available pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123), which is $25,000,000 more than the fis-cal year 2020 enacted level and equal to the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Unemployment Compensation National Activities. \u2014The Com- mittee recommends $18,000,000 for National Activities, which is $6,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This increase in fund-ing is intended to help modernize the UI Interstate Connection Network (ICON) hub and support States in administering the UI program. Employment Service. \u2014The Committee recommends $673,052,000 for the Employment Service allotment to States, which is $5,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fis-cal year 2021 budget request. The Committee also recommends $24,818,000 for Employment Service National Activities, which is $2,500,000 more than the fis-cal year 2020 enacted level and $5,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The increase in funds is intended to re-duce the processing backlog for the work opportunity tax credit program and for assisting States in adopting or modernizing infor-mation technology for processing of certification requests, which may include training and technical assistance to States. The Employment Service offers vital services such as referrals for job openings, career counseling, and job searches for individuals seeking employment, including veterans and people with disabil-ities. Since 1933, this Federal-State partnership has facilitated the connection between employers in need of workers and individuals seeking employment. Given the nature of this exchange, the De-partment has historically required that the Employment Service system rely on State merit-staff employees to ensure that these services are rendered in the public interest and not solely to meet private interests. However, the Department's recent final rule marks a dangerous departure from this operation. This final rule could upend vital public services provided to vulnerable popu-lations by privatizing job search functions and other forms of as-sistance. Although the Department received comments from the public outlining these concerns, the Department has chosen to ig-nore this counsel. As such, in an effort to preserve the Employment Service system, the recommendation includes new bill language preventing the implementation of the final rule, entitled ''Wagner- Peyser Act Staffing Flexibility'' (85 Fed. Reg. 592). Foreign Labor Certification. \u2014The Committee recommends $77,810,000 for the Foreign Labor Certification (FLC) program, which is $9,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $2,088,000 below the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The rec-ommendation includes $57,528,000 for Federal administration, an increase of $3,000,000 over the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $5,088,000 below the fiscal year 2021 budget request, that is in-tended to be used to ensure effective oversight and enforcement of employer regulations, and $20,282,000 for grants to States, an in- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, over the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $3,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 budget request. H-2A Program. \u2014The Committee notes there are increases in the number of H-2A applications requested and that States have re-quested additional support for the proper reviewing and oversight of processing of H-2A applications, recruitment of potential domes-tic agricultural workers, and oversight of contract terms. Within 120 days of enactment of this Act, the Committee directs the Secretary to submit a report to the Committees on Appropria-tions on the number of H-2A visa applications, trends in H-2A re-quests, and the distribution of funding according to the needs of States. The report shall detail how the agency considers costs asso-ciated with administrative and oversight requirements for both the H-2A and H-2B visa programs when determining the allocation. The Committee encourages the Department to continue to monitor the number and scope of requests from the previous year along with projected use in the coming year when determining State funding allocations. H-2B violations. \u2014The Committee directs the Department to sub- mit a report to the Committees on Appropriations within 120 days of enactment of this Act on the recent history of sanctions and rem- edies that the Department has issued in each of the last three fis-cal years against employers who violate H-2B provisions, including violations listed in 29 CFR \u00a7 503.19(a). The update should contain, but should not be limited to: a list of the employers that were cited and for what violation; how many workers in total have been im-pacted by violations; what impact the violations had on the domes-tic workforce; what industries the violations occurred in; how many employers have been debarred from the H-2B program; the meth-odology used in the decision to debar; and a justification for why repeat offenders continue to receive visas. The Department is also directed to include in such a report the distribution of visas grant-ed by industry and sector through the H-2B program and contain a tabulation of the percentage of overall visas provided to the top 15 employers. Schedule A Occupational Classification. \u2014The Committee is aware that the Schedule A occupational classification list currently includes only two broad occupational classifications and a narrow subset of other applicants. The Committee encourages the Sec-retary to consider rulemaking to improve the experience of employ-ers and to effectively allocate Department resources with the goal of protecting U.S. workers from undue foreign competition through the labor certification process. One-Stop Career Centers/Labor Market Information. \u2014The Com- mittee recommends $62,653,000 for One-Stop Career Centers and Labor Market Information, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $2,173,000 less than the fiscal year 2021 budget request. ADVANCES TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT TRUST FUND AND OTHER FUNDS The Committee recommends such sums as necessary for Ad- vances to the Unemployment Trust Fund and Other Funds. The funds are made available to accounts authorized under Federal and State unemployment insurance laws and the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund when the balances in such accounts are insufficient. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $158,656,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 171,600,000 Committee Recommendation ............................................................. 158,656,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... - - - Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - The recommendation includes $108,674,000 from the General Fund of the Treasury and $49,982,000 from the Employment Secu-rity Administration Account in the Unemployment Trust Fund. The Committee includes new bill language ensuring Office of Ap- prenticeship resources support Registered Apprenticeships and ade-quate staffing in the Office of Apprenticeship and State offices. Outreach. \u2014The Committee encourages the Department to sup- port student support services, academic advisement and profes-sional development for faculty and staff at educational institutions that offer accredited registered apprenticeship programs. Addition- ally, the Committee encourages the Department to support such in-stitutions and in their outreach to local elementary and secondary education schools, businesses, workforce boards, and other local leaders in order to most effectively serve current students and in-crease program awareness for future students and their commu-nities. Prize Competition. \u2014The Committee encourages the Department, in coordination with the Office of Science and Technology Policy, to establish a prize competition consistent with the requirements of section 24 of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, to support eligible programs designed to prepare high school students to enter and succeed in an in-demand industry sector or occupation. GAO Study on Automation. \u2014The Committee directs the Govern- ment Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a study that should explore: (1) the barriers to, and opportunities for, retraining work-ers in industries that have a high likelihood of being impacted by automation; (2) availability of data and strategies to improve collec-tion, with respect to the workforce in in-demand industry sectors and occupations in the United States, such as advanced manufac-turing, information technology, and health care, including how this data may be used to identify skills and jobs available for retrained workers or those displaced by automation; (3) the impact of the geographical location of workers and their access to transportation on the ability of the workers to access job training and related high-skilled positions; (4) what are the lessons learned from exist-ing training programs and what more could be done to respond to changes in the labor market, including evolving technologies. Not later than one year after enactment of this Act, GAO should pro-vide to the Committee a briefing on preliminary findings. Advanced Manufacturing. \u2014The Committee encourages the De- partment to support programs that facilitate partnerships between local educational entities (e.g., technical colleges, community col-leges, or entities that assist educationally underserved commu-nities) and manufacturers that employ individuals who have ad-vanced manufacturing skills. These programs should (1) develop skills and competencies in communities with expected growth in advanced manufacturing; (2) provide education and training for available and anticipated jobs in advanced manufacturing; (3) edu- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 career advancement opportunities within ad- vanced manufacturing; and (4) give priority to low-income incum-bent workers, dislocated workers, and unemployed individuals. Artificial Intelligence. \u2014The Committee notes that it is not yet fully understood the extent of the disruption Artificial Intelligence will cause and how it will impact the workforce. Therefore, the Committee emphasizes the importance of anticipating changes in the workforce, investing in worker retraining programs, and pro-viding adequate funding for registered apprenticeship programs. Long-term Unemployed. \u2014The Committee notes the economic challenges millions of individuals now face due to the coronavirus pandemic and high-unemployment. Within a matter of months, a nine-year period of sustained economic recovery and growth was swept away by a wave of pathogen, shuttering businesses and cre-ating economic uncertainty. The Committee also notes that the eco-nomic prospects for many individuals unemployed prior to the start of the national emergency were worsened as a result of COVID-19. Prior to the pandemic, these individuals faced significant barriers to employment, having been unemployed for 27 weeks or more. While it is essential that the Department supports policies and practices that put Americans back to work in a safe and sustain-able way, the Department must also ensure that the long-term un-employed do not fall through the cracks of our economic recovery. To advance this effort, the Committee encourages the Department to support reemployment programs targeting long-term unem-ployed workers. Open Data Reporting. \u2014The Committee notes that Congress has made a significant investment in our workforce development, post-secondary, and career and technical education systems. As a result of this investment, the number of credentials in the U.S. continues to rise. However, the Committee is aware that many workers and students may face challenges in navigating an intricate network of diplomas, licenses, certifications, and badges. Therefore, the rec-ommendation includes new bill language requiring the Department to publicly disclose information on credentials and competencies earned through Registered Apprenticeships and information related to occupational and professional licenses and certifications in an open-source format. The Committee believes that this requirement will lead to the development of useful comparison tools and other resources that will improve the delivery of workforce development and postsecondary education programs, as well as enable workers and students to make more informed choices in their educational and job-training journeys. The Committee directs the Department to ensure that such information is also provided in a consumer- tested and user-friendly manner to ensure that workers and stu-dents are able to utilize this information about potential creden-tials effectively. Remote Learning. \u2014The Committee encourages the Secretary to consider the various ways the delivery of training may need to be altered in response to COVID-19, including through remote access. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS SECURITY ADMINISTRATION SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $181,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 192,738,000 Committee Recommendation ............................................................. 181,000,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... - - - Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a511,738,000 The Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) assures the security of retirement, health and other workplace-related ben-efits of working Americans. The Committee recommends $181,000,000 for EBSA, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $11,738,000 less than the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The Committee continues to encourage EBSA to prioritize audit resources to review the Thrift Savings Plan's (TSP) Information Technology operating environment, including the adequacy of con- trols at contractor sites and TSP's progress in remediating pre-viously identified issues from past EBSA audits. P ENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $452,858,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 465,289,000 ............................................................. 465,289,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +12,431,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - Congress established the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to insure the defined-benefit pension plans of working Americans. WAGE AND HOUR DIVISION SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $242,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 244,283,000 ............................................................. 246,283,000 Change from ......................................................... +4,283,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +2,000,000 The Wage and Hour Division (WHD) enforces Federal minimum wage, overtime pay, recordkeeping, and child labor requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). WHD also has enforcement and other administrative responsibilities related to the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act, the Employee Polygraph Protection Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Davis Bacon Act, and the Service Contract Act. The Committee recommends $246,283,000 for WHD, which is $4,283,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This increase will sup-port WHD's role in implementing the Labor Value Content provi-sion to the Rules of Origin Chapter within the United States-Mex-ico-Canada Agreement. The increase will also support additional investigators to combat wage theft and protect workers. The Com-mittee urges WHD to explore and expand strategic enforcement ap-proaches to the agency's work to make the most of this increase. In the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification, WHD is directed to continue providing annual and historical information on the Payroll Audit Independent Determination (PAID) program, VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, including administrative expenditures on PAID, amounts recovered through PAID, and the number of businesses participating in PAID. On January 16, 2020, the WHD finalized its interpretative regu- lation narrowing joint employment liability under the FLSA, effec-tive March 16, 2020. The Committee is concerned that the Depart-ment acted beyond its authority by issuing an interpretive rule that conflicts with the law and congressional intent by so narrowly restricting its interpretation of joint employment liability to a ques-tion of control and rejecting the economic dependence inquiry. As an interpretive regulation, this rule does not have the force of law, but will dictate how and if the Department will continue to hold employers accountable when they are jointly liable for FLSA viola-tions. This could leave workers in low-wage, high-violation indus-tries vulnerable. In response to concerns about the Department's overreach and negative impact on workers, the Committee includes new bill lan-guage to prohibit the use of funds to implement or enforce the final interpretative regulation. Further, the Committee directs the De-partment to submit a report no later than 90 days of enactment of this Act to the Committees on Appropriations, the House Com-mittee on Education and Labor, and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions detailing the impact of the final interpretive rule on the WHD's enforcement actions involving joint employment liability under the FLSA. Such report shall in-clude the number of findings of joint employment liability under the FLSA the WHD made in fiscal years 2017, 2018, and 2019, disaggregated by industry; the number of investigations and the number of cases in Department-initiated litigation involving joint employment liability, disaggregated by industry, that were ongoing as of March 16, 2020; how the Department has proceeded with such cases and investigations between March 16, 2020 and the date of enactment of this Act; and the number of investigations and the number of cases in Department-initiated litigation involving joint employment liability, disaggregated by industry, that commenced on or after March 16, 2020 through the date of enactment of this Act. This report will provide transparency to the Committee to un-derstand the extent to which WHD no longer pursued joint employ-ment cases that it otherwise would have under the previous inter-pretation, leaving workers worse off. The Committee is deeply concerned by WHD Field Bulletin No. 2020-2, which scales back the agency's use of liquidated damages to compensate workers who have been denied their earned wages. Victims of wage theft deserve to not only be compensated for the wages they were denied, but for the cost of not having access to their pay over time. Further, WHD's decision to scale back its use of enforcement tools sends a strong signal to businesses that they can expect a slight slap on the wrist if any wrongdoing occurs. That approach is unacceptable, and it undermines WHD's core mission of protecting workers from wage theft. The Committee strongly urges WHD to adjust course and abandon Field Bulletin No. 2020- 2 so that workers can be appropriately compensated for their losses and so employers understand there are meaningful consequences for flagrant, repeated violations of the FLSA. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul OFFICE OF LABOR MANAGEMENT STANDARDS SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $43,187,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 50,410,000 ............................................................. 42,187,000 Change from ......................................................... \u00a51,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a58,223,000 The Office of Labor Management Standards (OLMS) administers the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA), which establishes safeguards for union democracy and union finan-cial integrity, and requires public disclosure reporting by unions, union officers, employees of unions, labor relations consultants, em-ployers, and surety companies. The Committee is concerned about OLMS' administration of the LMRDA, specifically efforts to utilize reporting and transparency requirements as tools to undermine, rather than strengthen, union democracy and integrity. The Department is encouraged to partner in good faith with those entities covered by the LMRDA to ensure compliance. O FFICE OF FEDERAL CONTRACT COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $105,976,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 106,412,000 Committee Recommendation ............................................................. 105,976,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... - - - Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a5436,000 The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) ensures equal employment opportunity in the Federal contracting community through enforcement, regulatory work, outreach and education to workers and their advocates. OFCCP is responsible, per Executive Order 11246 (EO 11246), for ensuring Federal contractors and subcontractors take affirma-tive action to ensure that all individuals have an equal opportunity for employment, without regard to race, color, religion, sex, or na-tional origin. The Committee supports OFCCP's efforts to make sure contractors and subcontractors are adhering fully to EO 11246. In the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification, OFCCP is directed to detail the agency's compliance and enforce-ment efforts with regard to promoting equal opportunities for em-ployment by contractors and subcontractors to the Federal govern-ment, including technology contractors and subcontractors. The Committee strongly opposes OFCCP's proposed rule on Im- plementing Legal Requirements Regarding the Equal Opportunity Clause's Religious Exemption, (RIN 1250-AA09), which would give taxpayer funded contractors, including for-profit corporations, the extraordinary power to hire and fire employees based on religion and the employer's understanding of religious tenets and beliefs. In response to these concerns, new bill language is included to pro-hibit funds from being used to implement, enforce, or give effect to this proposed rule. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, OFFICE OF WORKERS ' COMPENSATION PROGRAMS SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $117,601,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 119,312,000 Committee Recommendation ............................................................. 117,601,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... - - - Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a51,711,000 The Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) admin- isters the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, the Energy Employees Oc-cupational Illness Compensation Program Act, and the Black Lung Benefits Act. These programs provide eligible injured and disabled workers and their survivors with compensation, medical benefits, and services including rehabilitation, supervision of medical care, and technical and advisory counseling. The Committee recommendation includes $115,424,000 in Gen- eral Funds from the Treasury, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $462,000 above the fiscal year 2021 request, and $2,177,000 from the Special Fund established by the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.

The Committee recommends a mandatory appropriation of $40,970,000 in fiscal year 2021 for special benefits for disabled coal miners. This is in addition to the $14,000,000 appropriated last year as an advance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, for a total program level of $54,970,000 in fiscal year 2021. The Committee recommendation also provides $14,000,000 as an advance appropriation for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. These funds ensure uninterrupted payments to beneficiaries.

The Committee recognizes the vital role the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA) plays in the lives of former DOE employees and contractors and prioritizes policies that ensure efficient and effective medical care for these individuals. The Committee requests the Department sub-mit a report to the Committees within 180 days of enactment of this Act on the policy changes the Department made to the pro-gram in fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020, and the overall impact these changes have had on program beneficiaries and medical pro-viders. The report shall include information on how these policy changes have impacted the quality of care for program beneficiaries and how the policy changes have impacted operational efficiencies for medical providers. The Department shall ensure the Advisory Board on Toxic Sub- stances and Worker Health has sufficient funding and staffing to meet its obligations. BLACK LUNG DISABILITY TRUST FUND Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $365,240,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 382,991,000 ............................................................. 382,991,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +17,751,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, supported with manda- tory funding, pays black lung compensation, medical and survivor benefits, and administrative expenses when no mine operator can be assigned liability for such benefits, or when mine employment ceased prior to 1970. The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund is fi-nanced by an excise tax on coal, reimbursements from responsible mine operators, and short-term advances from the Treasury. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 authorized a re-structuring of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund debt and re-quired that annual operating surpluses be used to pay down the debt until all remaining obligations are retired. O CCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $581,787,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 576,813,000 ............................................................. 593,787,000 Change from ......................................................... +12,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +16,974,000 The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 established the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to assure safe and healthy working conditions by setting and enforcing standards and by providing training, outreach, education and as-sistance. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul Within the total for OSHA, the Committee provides the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2021 Committee Safety and Direction and Administration ......................................................................................... ................ 10,050,000 The Committee directs OSHA to publish Funding Opportunity Notices for the Susan Harwood Training Grant program no later than June 30, 2021. Further, the Committee directs OSHA to pro-vide technical assistance, guidance, and support for applicants in order to reduce the proportion of applicants that did not meet eligi-bility and program requirements included in Funding Opportunity Notices in previous fiscal years. The Committee encourages the Department to include hazards facing domestic workers as a topic for training in its announce-ments for Susan Harwood Training Grants. In the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification, OSHA is directed to include annual expenditures on the Voluntary Protec-tion Program for each year since fiscal year 2015 as well as planned expenditures in fiscal year 2022. The Committee recognizes the risks posed by the COVID-19 pan- demic to our nation's essential farm workforce as they continue to ensure the availability of the food supply. OSHA must use all avail-able resources provided by this Committee to fully protect workers from getting sick. That should start with issuing an Emergency Temporary Infectious Disease Standard. Clear, effective, com-prehensive requirements from OSHA is the only way to guarantee that all workers, including farmworkers, receive the protections from COVID-19 that will keep them safe. Fortunately, much work has been done over the past decade on an infectious disease rule-making that can be used to issue the Emergency Temporary Infec-tious Disease Standard. In the interim, to protect workers from coronavirus infection, OSHA should be fully enforcing all applicable standards and directives, including the Personal Protective Equip-ment standard (29 CFR 1910.132), the Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134), the General Duty Clause (Section 5(a)(1) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970), and the Bloodborne Pathogens standard (29 CFR 1910.1030). Particular emphasis should be placed on workplaces where workers are deemed essential and also face a higher risk of infection, such as slaughterhouses, poultry processing plants, and agricultural work-places. To minimize the risk of a future COVID-19 outbreak and miti- gate the impacts of having to shut down operations and decontami- nate a worksite if a case of COVID-19 is detected among their workforce, the Committee urges OSHA to create clear requirements VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, for manufacturers and other employers on best prac- tices for protecting workers from infectious diseases. The Committee recognizes the challenge of ensuring adequate en- forcement in remote geographical areas, such as the Pacific terri-tories, and that there have been worker fatalities and injuries in areas where there is no permanent enforcement presence. The Committee encourages OSHA to ensure compliance safety and health officers are adequately serving these territories and to pro-vide an assessment of need for areas with no permanent enforce-ment presence in its fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Jus-tification. The Committee is deeply concerned that OSHA is failing to move forward to develop and issue needed standards on major safety and health problems. One issue of particular concern is workplace vio-lence, a serious and growing problem that has reached epidemic levels. Workplace violence is now the third leading cause of death and is responsible for nearly 30,000 serious injuries every year. Nurses, medical assistants, emergency responders and social work-ers face some of the greatest threats, suffering more than 70 per-cent of all workplace assaults. Workers who are women are at par-ticular risk, suffering two out of every three serious workplace vio-lence injuries. In January 2017, OSHA committed to developing and issuing a workplace violence standard, but the agency has not yet completed a required small business review, and there is no es-timated date for the issuance of a proposed or final rule. The Com-mittee believes issuing a workplace violence standard to protect workers in health care and social services should be a top priority for the Department. In order to monitor the agency's progress on this important rule, the Committee directs OSHA to brief the Com-mittees on Appropriations, within 90 days of enactment of this Act, on a schedule for moving this rule to completion, including the dates on which a proposed rule and final rule will be issued.

MSHA is directed to include in the fiscal year 2022 Congres- sional Budget Justification and all future Congressional Budget Justifications historical and budget year information on enforce-ment activities and outcomes, distinguishing between coal and metal/non-metal mines. To promote transparency in agency spend-ing on its enforcement activities, MSHA shall continue to sepa-rately present annual spending on coal and metal/non-metal mines as it has in past Congressional Budget Justifications. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $655,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 658,318,000 Committee Recommendation ............................................................. 655,000,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... - - - Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a53,318,000 The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is an independent national statistical agency that collects, processes, analyzes, and dissemi-nates essential economic data to the Congress, Federal agencies, State and local governments, businesses, and the public. Its prin-cipal surveys include the Consumer Price Index and the monthly unemployment series. The Committee recommendation includes $587,000,000 from the General Fund of the Treasury and $68,000,000 from the Employ-ment Security Administration Account in the Unemployment Trust Fund. Within the total for BLS, the Committee provides the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2021 Committee Employment and Unemployment .......... $221,000,000 Labor Market Information ....................................................................................................... Cost of Living Compensation and Working and Technology .................................................................................................... and Staff Services ......................................................................................... ................. 62,000,000 The Committee is supportive of BLS' workplan for implementing investments included in the explanatory statement accompanying the Department of Labor Appropriations Act, 2020, which includes: An annual supplement to the Current Population Survey to allow for collection of data on contingent and alternative work arrangements every two years and data on other topics related to the labor force in alternate years, including an occa-sional veterans supplement; Restoration of the production and publication of employ- ment, unemployment, and labor force data under the Local Area Unemployment Statistics program for New England Minor Civil Divisions with populations less than 1,000; and, Investment into the planning, development, and imple- mentation of a new National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) cohort. BLS shall brief the Committees on Appropriations with updated estimates for the annual costs and five-year plan for implementing the new NLSY cohort within 90 days of enactment of this Act. The Committee is supportive of BLS' interest in improving the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) and Consumer Ex-penditure (CE) program poverty measurement; however, BLS must ensure it has adequate resources for the planning, development, and implementation of the new NLSY cohort before moving to new investments for JOLTS and CE. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul implementing these investments, BLS shall not reduce or eliminate existing statistical work. Further, BLS shall not reduce the number of full-time equivalent positions beyond the appor-tioned fiscal year 2020 full-time equivalent ceiling. Within the total amount for BLS, the Committee includes $13,000,000 to continue the relocation of the BLS headquarters, which was initiated in fiscal year 2020. BLS is strongly urged to consider the needs of its employees throughout this transition and to work with the General Services Administration (GSA) to address any outstanding safety concerns and office space considerations for the development of sensitive economic indicators. In addition, BLS, in coordination with the Administrator of GSA, shall follow appro-priate CDC guidance and take such actions as are necessary to mitigate and reduce the potential for airborne transmission of COVID-19 through air conditioning, heating, ventilating, water systems, and floor plans in facilities owned or leased by the GSA and occupied by BLS, to ensure safe and healthy indoor environ-ments for BLS employees. Such plans should include consideration of worker health and safety during the move to the Suitland Fed-eral Center. Within 120 days of enactment of this Act, the GSA shall provide a report to the Committees on Appropriations on all plans to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in all facilities controlled by the GSA and occupied by BLS. The Committee encourages BLS to consider expanding the Con- tingent Worker and Alternative Work Arrangement Supplement (CWS) to the Current Population Survey (CPS) to measure both workers engaged in alternative work as a primary form of occupa-tion as well as workers who engage in alternative work in a supple-mentary or informal capacity. This could include, but is not limited to, traditional employees who engage in alternative work, including as independent contractors, in addition to their primary occupa-tions. The Committee is aware that BLS forecasts labor-market trends using historical data and is supportive of any efforts that would incorporate a wider and more forward-looking range of in-puts to better project how rapidly changing technology and automa-tion will impact the workforce of the future. In the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification, the Committee requests that BLS include its views on the merits of developing more forward- looking estimates. Furthermore, the Committee is aware of the development of arti- ficial intelligence and encourages BLS to examine this trend's im-pact on the economy.

Given the high number of young adults with disabilities who ex- perience significant challenges to live independently and achieve gainful employment, the Committee encourages ODEP to quantify and evaluate the efficacy of experiential learning work-life pro-grams that serve young adults with developmental disabilities, in-cluding those with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), which is the fastest growing developmental disability in the U.S. with approxi-mately 1 in 59 children diagnosed each year, and more than 50,000 young adults with ASD turning 18 in the next fiscal year. Further, the Committee encourages ODEP to evaluate barriers to both at-taining and sustaining employment and career development within this population, and the financial impact that long-term gainful employment will have on increasing the number of young adults with developmental disabilities who are able to achieve economic self-sufficiency.

In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $15,000,000 for Departmental Management to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the coronavirus, including to implement paid family and medical leave, paid sick leave, worker protection and Unemployment Insur-ance stabilization activities. Within the total for Departmental Management, the Committee provides the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2021 Committee Program Direction ........................................................................................................ ........................... 5,516,000 Of the $96,125,000 recommended for the International Labor Af- fairs Bureau (ILAB), the Committee directs the Secretary to allo-cate not less than $13,500,000 in grants to build the capacity of VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, countries to enforce labor rights to promote a more level playing field for workers in the U.S. while maintaining critical funding for combatting child labor. ILAB is directed to continue its work on three key reports, including: DOL's Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor; the List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor; and, the List of Products Produced by Forced or In-dentured Child Labor. In fiscal year 2020, the Committee provided additional resources to the Office of Trade and Labor Affairs to bolster monitoring and enforcement activities around the world and to hire additional labor attaches in critical U.S. Embassies to increase field-based and international monitoring. ILAB is in urgent need of attache \u00b4s in Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Geneva, Switzerland for engagement with the International Labor Organization (ILO). The Committee is very supportive of ILAB's efforts to hire addi- tional attache \u00b4s in Mexico to support the U.S.'s enforcement of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA); however, those expenses should be supported by resources this Committee pro-vided in Title IX of the USMCA Implementation Act (P.L. 116- 113), which included $210,000,000 for ILAB. Resources provided in this Act should support ILAB's efforts to add additional attache \u00b4s in other areas of strategic importance, such as Bangladesh, Vietnam, and ILO engagement in Geneva, Switzerland. Finally, the Committee urges ILAB to use USMCA Implementa- tion Act funding to directly support workers' rights and capacity to organize independent unions in Mexico. These activities must be central to ILAB's monitoring, enforcement, and capacity-building roles in USMCA implementation. ILAB can also advance this crit-ical work through technical assistance that strengthens the capac-ity of independent unions in USMCA priority sectors. Further, ILAB can fund research and legal teams, including through aca-demic institutions, to develop sustainable programs that train and support labor lawyers and researchers in priority sectors. Finally, ILAB can support key USMCA objectives by funding innovative supply chain monitoring and accountability mechanisms, focused on ensuring the effective recognition of workers' rights to organize and collective bargaining in USMCA priority sectors. Such efforts to develop necessary research, legal assistance and monitoring mechanisms will collectively supplement and strengthen core ILAB program to directly educate and train workers to build independent unions. In the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification, ILAB is directed to include spending plans for resources provided in the USMCA Implementation Act for fiscal years 2020, 2021, and 2022. Spending plans should include descriptions and amounts for projects and staffing. The Committee directs the Department to notify and brief the Committees on Appropriations, the House Committee on Ways and Means, and the Senate Committee on Finance, no later than seven days in advance of any action to transfer funds provided in the USMCA Implementation Act. Of the $15,050,000 appropriated to the Women's Bureau, the Committee provides no less than $1,794,000 for the Women in Ap-prenticeship and Nontraditional Occupations (WANTO) program, which is $500,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, again rejects the fiscal year 2021 budget request's proposal to eliminate WANTO. This program helps employers and labor unions recruit, train, and retain women for nontraditional employment opportunities. These resources are essential in helping women overcome traditional barriers to entry and supporting wom-en's full participation in the labor force. The Committee directs the Department to submit its annual Op- erating Plan to the Committees on Appropriations within the 45- day statutory deadline. The Committee understands that, as the largest advertiser in the U.S., the Federal Government should work to ensure fair access to its advertising contracts for small disadvantaged businesses and businesses owned by minorities and women. The Committee directs the Department to include the following information in its fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification: Expenditures for fis-cal year 2020 and expected expenditures for fiscal years 2021 and 2022, respectively, for (1) all contracts for advertising services; and, (2) contracts for the advertising services of (I) socially and economi-cally disadvantaged small business concerns (as defined in section 8(a)(4) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)(4)); and (II) women- and minority-owned businesses. The Committee directs the Department to provide a report not later than 30 days after the conclusion of each quarter detailing the number of full-time equivalent employees and attrition by prin-cipal office and appropriations account. The Committee directs the Department to provide a report to the Committees on Appropriations within 120 days of enactment of this Act on the number of full-time equivalent employees and funds ob-ligated for personnel, training, equipment and travel to provide se-curity for the Secretary and others covered under applicable secu-rity detail provisions within this Act for fiscal years 2019 and 2020. In addition, the Department shall include projected costs for fiscal years 2021 and 2022 in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification. The Committee supports targeted investments in impoverished areas, particularly in persistent poverty counties and in other high poverty census tracts. To understand how programs funded through the Department are serving these particular areas, the Committee directs the Department to submit a report to the Com-mittees on Appropriations on the percentage of funds allocated by all competitive grant programs and other anti-poverty programs in fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020 and estimates for fiscal year 2021 to serve individuals living in persistent poverty counties, as defined as a county that has had 20 percent or more of its population living in poverty over the past 30 years, as measured by the 1990 and 2000 decennial censuses and the most recent Small Area Income and Poverty estimates, or any territory or possession of the U.S., and high-poverty areas, as defined as any census tract with a pov-erty rate of at least 20 percent as measured by the 2014-2018 5- year data series available from the American Community Survey of the Census Bureau. The Department shall report this informa-tion to the Committees within 90 days of such data being available and provide a briefing to the Committees not later than 180 days of enactment of this Act on how the Department is carrying out this directive. In the case of any program for which at least 10 per- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul cent of the funds allocated in fiscal year 2020 were not allocated to persistent poverty counties or for which the percentage allocated to high-poverty areas in fiscal year 2020 was less than the average percentage of Federal assistance allocated to high-poverty areas awarded under the program in fiscal years 2017, 2018, and 2019, such report and briefing shall explain why such a benchmark is un-able to be met. The Committee is supportive of efforts by the Department to con- sider evidence of effectiveness in grant competitions and requests an update in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justifica-tion on implementation of the Foundations for Evidence-based Pol-icymaking Act (P.L. 115-435) and implementation plans for the coming year. The Committee encourages the Secretary to develop guidance to ensure relevant participants and grantees are involved in the Department-wide process of prioritizing evidence needs, in-cluding participating in Department led evaluations. Consistent with program statutes, the Committee encourages the Secretary to ensure that evidence of effectiveness is a consideration in grant op-portunities. The Committee directs the Department to comply with title 31 of the United States Code, including the development of organiza-tional priority goals and outcomes such as performance outcome measures, output measures, efficiency measures, and customer service measures. The Committee further directs the Department to include an update on the progress of these efforts in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification. The Committee continues to support efforts to improve customer service in accordance with Executive Order 13571\u2014Streamlining Service Delivery and Improving Customer Service. The Committee directs the Secretary to develop standards to improve customer service and incorporate the standards into the performance plans required under 31 U.S.C. 1115. The Committee further directs the Department to include an update on the progress of these efforts in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification. The Committee is concerned by the Department's implementa- tion of Executive Orders 13836, 13837, and 13839 and eagerness to bring disputes with employee bargaining units before the Federal Service Impasses Panel. The Committee urges the Department to negotiate in good faith with Department's employees and cease ef-forts that curtail their ability to collectively bargain and organize. The Committee is concerned by reports of widespread workplace harassment and mistreatment of vulnerable workers, including do-mestic workers. To address these concerns, the Committee directs GAO to study and recommend improvements to Federal support programs for survivors of workplace harassment in low-wage, vul-nerable, and marginalized sectors like domestic work. This would include recommendations to ensure that domestic workers can safe-ly access housing, health care, mental health, and counseling serv-ice supports; as well as workers compensation, unemployment in-surance, disability benefits, transportation stipends, and other sup-port. The Committee is deeply concerned about the 11.9 million chil- dren, including 7.5 million Black and Latino children, living in pov-erty as of 2018. Now, millions more are projected to live in poverty due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Without robust Federal support, VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, a Columbia University study estimates that child poverty could balloon from an already shameful 13.6 percent to nearly 21 per-cent, with Black and Latino children bearing a disproportionate risk of falling into or deeper into poverty. More than 50 percent of low-income households report they or someone in their household has experienced job loss or a pay cut, and more nearly 40 million Americans have lost their jobs to date. During the pandemic, fami-lies are stretched thinner than ever and far too many families, es-pecially in communities of color, are struggling to pay the bills and keep the lights on. The Committee recognizes that resources pro-vided for the Department are critical now more than ever to reduc-ing child poverty and racial disparities. However, there is concern that especially with tight budget caps for fiscal year 2021, funding for programs to help children in poverty is not enough. Deep in-equities remain for children of color who are often more segregated by neighborhood, lower socioeconomic status, and in K-12 school-ing. The Committee requests that the Department looks for oppor-tunities to target resources to communities with the highest child poverty rates to help reduce child poverty and racial disparities, es-pecially in the context of COVID-19, and as the pandemic threat-ens to increase child poverty for years to come. VETERANS EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $311,341,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 312,000,000 ............................................................. 313,841,000 Change from ......................................................... +2,500,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +1,841,000 The recommendation includes $57,500,000 from the General Fund of the Treasury and $256,341,000 from the Employment Se-curity Administration Account in the Unemployment Trust Fund. The Veterans Employment and Training (VETS) program serves America's veterans and separating service members by preparing them for meaningful careers, providing employment resources and expertise, and protecting their employment rights. Within the total for VETS, the Committee provides the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2021 Committee State Administration Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program ........................................................................................ ............ 57,500,000 The Committee recommendation includes $29,379,000 for the Transition Assistance Program, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This funding will enhance the quality of employment support serv-ices for transitioning service members and allow VETS to develop and implement a course curriculum to help military spouses over-come the challenges they face related to employment and career de-velopment. The Committee includes $57,500,000 for the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program, which is $2,500,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul Funds will be used to further support the needs of veterans experi- encing homelessness. The Committee includes $500,000, which is the same as the fis- cal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request, to support the HIRE Vets Medallion Program authorized by the Honoring Investments in Recruiting and Employing American Mili-tary Veterans Act of 2017. The Committee recommendation includes $300,000 within Fed- eral Administration, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 en-acted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request, to continue the operation of the Disabled Veteran Program (DVP), which was initi-ated by the Committee last year. The DVP addresses the high un-employment and low labor force participation rate of veterans with service-connected and non-service-connected disabilities. The DVP helps increase employment and advancement opportunities for vet-erans with disabilities by working with Federal, State, and private partners to promote the hiring of veterans with disabilities, im-prove coordination of available employment services and supports, and to identify and share employment best practices for hiring, re-taining, and advancing veterans with disabilities in the workforce. Equity and Access for Homeless Veterans. \u2014The Committee di- rects the Department to include an update on racial equity and ac-cess to programs at the Department providing services to homeless veterans in its fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification. The update shall also track departmental expenditures within the Homeless Veteran Programs, specifically with regard to minority, female, and LGBTQ populations. Where available, the Department shall disaggregate data by ethnicity, age, gender identity, and dis-charge status. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $25,269,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 37,000,000 Committee Recommendation ............................................................. 25,269,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... - - - Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a511,731,000 Information Technology (IT) Modernization provides a dedicated source of funding for Department-wide IT modernization projects together with funding through the Department's Working Capital Fund.

The recommendation includes $85,187,000 from the General Fund of the Treasury, which is $1,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $1,646,000 below the fiscal year 2021 VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul and $5,660,000 from the Employment Security Ad- ministration Account in the Unemployment Trust Fund. The CARES Act (P.L.116-136) included $26 million, including $1,000,000 in discretionary funding, for the OIG to conduct over-sight of activities supported with funds appropriated to the Depart-ment to prevent, prepare for, and respond to COVID-19.

TITLE II\u2014DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES H EALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES ADMINISTRATION Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $7,037,259,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 6,289,085,000 ............................................................. 7,193,758,000 Change from ......................................................... +156,499,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +904,673,000 The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) sup- ports programs that provide health services to disadvantaged, medically underserved, and special populations; decrease infant mortality rates; assist in the education of health professionals; and provide technical assistance regarding the utilization of health re-sources and facilities. The Committee recommendation for HRSA includes $7,193,758,000 in discretionary budget authority, and $265,600,000 in mandatory funding and $10,200,000 in trust fund appropriations for the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program Trust Fund. In addition, the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supple- mental Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-123) included $100,000,000 and the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $275,000,000 in discre-tionary appropriations and $1,320,000,000 in mandatory funding to support health centers, Ryan White HIV/AIDS clinics, and hos-pitals respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. PRIMARY HEALTH CARE Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $1,626,522,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 1,728,522,000 ............................................................. 1,651,522,000 Change from ......................................................... 25,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a577,000,000 Health Centers The Committee recommends $1,650,522,000 for the Health Cen- ters program, $25,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $77,000,000 below the fiscal year 2021 budget request. In addition, the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supple- mental Appropriations Act included $100,000,000 and the CARES Act included $1,320,000,000 in mandatory funding to support COVID-19 testing and treatment as well as maintain other critical services at Health Centers. The Committee includes bill language providing up to $120,000,000 for the Federal Tort Claims Act program, the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budg-et request. Ending the HIV Epidemic Initiative. \u2014The Committee provides $65,000,000 within the Health Centers program for the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) Initiative, $15,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $72,000,000 below the fiscal year 2021 VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul request. This investment builds on an increase of $50,000,000 included in fiscal year 2020, bringing the two-year in-vestment in Health Centers for their role in the EHE Initiative to a total of $115,000,000. This initiative provides funding to Health Centers in high-need jurisdictions to increase the use of pre-expo-sure prophylaxis (PrEP) among people at high risk for HIV trans-mission. Native Hawaiian Health Care Program. \u2014The Committee pro- vides $19,000,000 within the total for Health Centers for the Na-tive Hawaiian Health Care Program, the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The Native Hawaiian Healthcare Systems help improve the health sta-tus of Native Hawaiians by making health education, health pro-motion, disease prevention, and Native Hawaiian traditional heal-ing services available. Health Care for the Homeless. \u2014Recognizing the complex and se- rious health challenges homeless individuals face, the Committee urges HRSA to prioritize access to expanded behavioral health services, including mental health services and substance use dis-order treatment services. Health Center Guidelines for Hepatitis B (HBV) and Hepatitis C (HCV). \u2014Funded health centers are expected to follow the USPSTF Guidelines for testing of HBV and HCV, vaccination against Hepa-titis A (HAV) and HBV, and offering appropriate care and treat-ment for those clients who test positive for these viruses. The Com-mittee requests that HRSA submit a status report within 180 days of enactment of Act on the number of annual viral hepatitis tests conducted and adult vaccinations administered by Community Health Centers, and the number of clients treated for HBV and cured of HCV. The Committee requests that HRSA provide guid-ance to Federally-Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) outlining how primary care doctors ought to manage and treat HCV. Health Centers and Home Visiting Programs. \u2014The Committee supports HRSA's continued promotion of expanded partnerships be-tween Health Centers and evidence-based home visiting programs to improve maternal and child health outcomes in high-need com-munities. Home visiting programs can also provide cost-effective benefits such as care coordination and service referral that help Health Centers achieve community health goals. As such, the Com-mittee directs the Bureau to issue written guidance on how these partnerships fit within Health Centers' scope of practice. Health Centers as Primary Dental Homes. \u2014The Committee rec- ognizes the importance of Health Centers in providing integrated care to the nation's underserved communities. Health Centers serve as a primary dental home for many who would otherwise face barriers to dental care. The Committee is aware that some Health Centers have partnered with Community Dental Health Coordina-tors (CDHCs) to provide patients with greater access to dental care. CDHCs provide community-based prevention, care coordination, and patient navigation to underserved populations in rural, urban, and Native American communities. The Committee encourages HRSA to work with Health Centers to expand their work in this area. HRSA Strategy to Address Intimate Partner Violence and Project Catalyst. \u2014The Committee includes no less than $1,500,000 for the VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul to Address Intimate Partner Violence, an increase of $500,000 over the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The Committee particularly supports training, technical assistance, and resource development to assist public health and health care professionals to better serve individuals and communities impacted by intimate partner violence. School-Based Health Centers. \u2014The Committee includes an in- crease of $10,000,000 within the total for Health Centers to in-crease the number of and services provided at SBHCs. SBHCs pro-vide a convenient access point to high-quality, comprehensive pri-mary health care, mental health services, preventive care, social services, and youth development to primarily children and adoles-cents from low-income families. Free Clinics Medical Malpractice The Committee recommends $1,000,000 for carrying out respon- sibilities under the Federal Tort Claims Act, the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The program provides medical malpractice coverage to individuals involved in the operation of free clinics to expand access to health care services to low-income individuals in medically underserved areas. HEALTH WORKFORCE Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $1,194,506,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 370,425,000 ............................................................. 1,242,505,000 Change from ......................................................... +47,999,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +872,080,000 The Bureau of Health Workforce strengthens the health care workforce by providing grants, scholarships, and loan repayment programs to help communities recruit and retain health care pro-viders where they are most needed. Health Professions The Committee recommends $847,505,000 for the Health Profes- sions programs, $42,999,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $477,080,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The Health Professions programs support grants for the develop-ment of the health workforce in fields challenged by a high need and insufficient supply of health professionals. Given that colleges and universities serve the dual role of training students and car-rying out a majority of Federally-funded biomedical research, the Committee believes these institutions serve as an ideal setting to expose future clinicians to the evidence base that underlies their intended profession. Within the total for Health Professions, the Committee rec- ommends the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2021 Committee National Health Service Corps .................................................................................................. ..................... $120,000,000 Health Professions Training for Diversity Centers of Excellence .......................................................................................................... .................. 23,711,000 Health Careers Opportunity ........................................................................................ .... 11 2014 Primary Care Training and Enhancement ..........................................................................................

Due to the geographic challenges of these two States, including large rural areas, areas of sparse population, fragmentation, duplication due to roadless areas (including ocean geography), and higher costs due to the volume of patients served, non-contiguous areas have geographic challenges that make it dif-ficult to provide access to quality health care. The Committee re-quests a report, not later than 180 days of enactment of this Act, on best practices and strategies to attract health care practitioners to non-contiguous States, especially in the areas with health care professional shortages. Health Professionals Staffing Shortages Report. \u2014The Committee recognizes the current and growing shortage of primary care physi-cians, psychiatrists, behavioral health specialists, and geriatric medical professionals. The Committee looks forward to receiving the Health Professional Staffing Shortages report requested in House Report 116-62, which was due by June 20, 2020. HRSA Diversity Programs. \u2014The Committee supports programs that improve the diversity of the healthcare workforce. HRSA's di-versity pipeline programs, including the Health Careers Oppor-tunity Program, Centers for Excellence, Faculty Loan Repayment, Nursing Workforce Diversity, and Scholarships for Disadvantaged Students help advance patient care and ensure opportunity for all healthcare providers. The Committee requests a report within 180 days of enactment of this Act on how these programs can be fur-ther strengthened to address mental health disparities. Pediatric Nephrology Workforce. \u2014The Committee is concerned about the growing shortage of pediatric nephrologists, particularly in rural parts of the country. If these trends continue, there will not be enough pediatric nephrologists to treat children with kidney disease. The Committee requests a report within 120 days of enact-ment of this Act on ways HRSA can support efforts to recruit, train, and support pediatric nephrologists, including existing work-force training opportunities and recommendations to address health professional staffing shortages. Rural Medical Provider Shortages. \u2014The Committee is concerned with the large medical provider shortage in rural areas around the country. The Committee directs HRSA to submit a report to the VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, Committee and the Committee on Ways and Means within 180 days of enactment of this Act detailing specific strategies and the associated costs that could be used to eliminate medical provider shortages in rural communities, including but not limited to ex-panding the National Health Service Corps. This report should place an emphasis on both recruitment and retention of medical providers in rural communities. Centers of Excellence (COEs) The Committee notes that COEs disproportionately educate health professionals from minority and underserved backgrounds and address the need for a diverse and culturally competent Amer-ican healthcare workforce. The Committee looks forward to receiv-ing the report requested in House Report 116-32 on achievements and challenges faced by COEs and the contribution COEs make to workforce development. Health Careers Opportunity Program (HCOP) The Committee notes that HCOPs assist students from minority and economically disadvantaged backgrounds navigate careers into the health professions. Given the volume of HCOP scholars that re-turn or remain in medically underserved communities, the Com-mittee encourages HRSA's Bureau of Health Workforce to continue its improvement of the diversity and distribution of needed health care professionals through National Health Career Opportunity Program Academies and urges HRSA to report updates on HCOP pipeline activity back to Congress within 120 days of the enactment of this Act. Scholarships for Disadvantaged Students Within the total funding for Scholarships for Disadvantaged Stu- dents, the Committee directs $2,500,000, the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level, to be set aside to educate midwives to ad-dress the national shortage of maternity care providers and the lack of diversity in the maternity care workforce. Oral Health Training Oral Health Training and Dental Faculty Loan Repayment Pro- gram. \u2014Within the total for Oral Health Training, the Committee includes not less than $12,000,000 for General Dentistry Programs and not less than $12,000,000 for Pediatric Dentistry Programs. The Committee directs HRSA to provide continuation funding for section 748 Dental Faculty Loan Program (DFLRP) grants initially awarded in fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018. The Committee con-tinues to support DFLRP awards with a preference for pediatric dentistry faculty supervising dental students or residents and pro-viding clinical services in dental clinics located in dental schools, hospitals, and community-based affiliate sites. Area Health Education Centers (AHEC) AHEC Oral Health Projects. \u2014The Committee encourages HRSA to support AHEC oral health projects that establish primary points of service and address the need to help patients find treatment out-side of hospital emergency rooms. The Committee encourages HRSA to work with programs that have already been initiated by VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, some State dental associations to refer emergency room patients to dental networks. Mental and Behavioral Health Education Training (MBHET) Pro- grams Graduate Psychology Education. \u2014Within the total for MBHET, the Committee recommendation includes $20,000,000, $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request, for the interprofessional Graduate Psychology Edu-cation (GPE) Program to support health service psychologists trained to provide integrated services to high-need, underserved populations in rural and urban communities. In addressing the opioid epidemic, the Committee recognizes the growing need for highly trained mental and behavioral health professionals to de-liver evidence-based behavioral interventions for pain management. The Committee encourages HRSA to help integrate health service psychology trainees at FQHCs. Behavioral Health Workforce Education and Training (BHWET) The Committee includes $127,000,000 for the BHWET Program, $25,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This program establishes and expands internships or field placement programs in behavioral health serv-ing populations in rural and medically underserved areas. BHWET Support in Rural Settings. \u2014The Committee is con- cerned about the utilization of BHWET programs by rural resi-dents and in rural areas. In the 2017-2018 academic year, only 27 percent of BHWET trainees were from rural areas, 25 percent of BHWET clinical sites were located in rural settings, and 20 percent of BHWET trainees were receiving training in rural areas. The Committee encourages HRSA to increase the number of trainees from rural areas, clinical sites located in rural areas, and trainees receiving training in rural areas. The Committee directs HRSA to update the Committee on such efforts within 180 days of enact-ment of this Act. Peer Support Specialists in the Opioid Use Disorder Workforce. \u2014 Within the total for BHWET, the Committee includes $15,000,000, an increase of $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $15,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request, to fund training, internships, and national certification for mental health and substance abuse peer support specialists to create an advanced peer workforce prepared to work in clinical settings. The Com-mittee further recommends that consideration should be given to community-based experiential training for students focusing on vet-erans, first responders, or marginalized populations. Loan Repayment Program for Substance Use Disorder Treatment Workforce .\u2014The Committee includes $17,000,000 for the Loan Re- payment Program for Substance Use Disorder Treatment Work-force, $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This program addresses shortages in the substance use disorder (SUD) workforce by providing for the repayment of education loans for individuals working in a full-time SUD treatment job that involves direct patient care in either a Mental Health Professional Shortage Area or a county where the overdose death rate exceeds the national average. This program VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, increasing the ranks of a well-trained SUD work- force in communities across America and helps save lives by equip-ping the frontline professionals who prevent and treat addiction, provide recovery support, and help reduce the negative con-sequences associated with substance use. Mental and Substance Use Disorder Workforce Training Dem- onstration. \u2014The Committee includes $41,700,000 for the Mental and Substance Use Disorder Workforce Training Demonstration program, $15,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $12,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This pro-gram makes grants to institutions, including but not limited to medical schools and FQHCs, to support training for medical resi-dents and fellows in psychiatry and addiction medicine, as well as nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and others, to provide SUD treatment in underserved communities. Within the total, the Committee includes an additional $15,000,000 for new grants to ex-pand the number of nurse practitioners, physician assistants, health service psychologists, and social workers trained to provide mental and substance use disorder services in underserved commu-nity-based settings that integrate primary care and mental and substance use disorder services, which may include establishing, maintaining, or improving academic units or programs to support those activities, as authorized under section 760 of the PHS Act. The Committee remains concerned by the lack of pediatric and adolescent addiction medicine and addiction psychiatry expertise. Currently, there are insufficient opportunities to effectively train a robust mental health and substance use disorder workforce. Only 75 of the nation's 179 accredited medical schools offer addiction medicine fellowships, and only one program focuses on fellowship opportunities for pediatric and adolescent addiction medicine and addiction psychiatry. This gap is even more troubling given that the onset of mental health disorders and substance use disorders are most likely to occur at a young age. Substance use disorders prevent children and adolescents from reaching their full potential and are antecedent to addiction in adulthood, and it is evident that our nation is not equipped to support this population. Therefore, the Committee strongly encourages HRSA to include an adequate number of funding awards to fellowship programs focused on in-creasing the number of board-certified pediatric and adolescent ad-diction medicine and addiction psychiatry subspecialists. Public Health And Preventive Medicine Programs The Committee includes $19,000,000 for Public Health and Pre- ventive Medicine Training Grant Programs, $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $19,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Within this total, the Committee provides an increase of $1,000,000 for the Preventive Medicine Residency Training Program and an increase of $1,000,000 for Public Health Training Centers. Nurse Practitioner Optional Fellowship Program The Committee provides $5,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budg-et request, to make grants to establish or expand optional commu-nity-based nurse practitioner fellowship programs that are accred- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul nurse practitioners (NPs) in pri- mary care or behavioral health. The Committee directs HRSA to give preference to FQHCs, as defined by section 1861(aa)(4) of the Social Security Act. The Committee is concerned the nation is un-prepared for healthcare provider shortages and recognizes that op-tional postgraduate programs with this focus, integrating primary care and behavioral health, will help to address this problem. Pa-tients need expert primary care and behavioral health providers prepared to manage the social and clinical complexities experienced in FQHCs. A key focus of the program will be training and profes-sional development in the integration of primary care and behav-ioral health. The program will provide original fellowships for transitioning to an integrated model of care consistent with the current high standards of NP education and practice meeting the needs of our nation's most vulnerable populations. Nursing Education, Practice, Quality, and Retention (NEPQR) Experiential Learning Opportunities. \u2014Within the total for NEPQR, the Committee includes not less than $2,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request, for competitive grants to en-hance nurse education and strengthen the nursing workforce through the expansion of experiential learning opportunities. The Committee encourages HRSA to support qualifying nurse education training programs at community colleges throughout the country. The Committee directs HRSA to ensure that these grants include as an allowable use the purchase of simulation training equipment. The Committee also directs HRSA to give priority to grantees lo-cated in a health professional shortage area in a State with an age- adjusted high burden of stroke, heart disease, and obesity, and to prioritize submissions that support high poverty rate communities. Children's Hospitals Graduate Medical Education The Committee recommends $340,000,000 for the Children's Hos- pitals Graduate Medical Education (CHGME) Payment program, the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $340,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The CHGME Payment program helps eligible hospitals maintain graduate medical edu-cation programs, which support the training of residents to care for the pediatric population and enhance the supply of primary care and pediatric medical and surgical subspecialties. Medical Student Education The Committee recommends $55,000,000, $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $55,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request, to support colleges of medicine at public uni-versities located in the top quintile of States projected to have a primary care provider shortage. The Committee directs HRSA to give priority to applications from universities located in States with the greatest number of Federally-recognized Tribes. The Committee also directs HRSA to give priority to applications from public uni-versities with a demonstrated public-private partnership. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul Data Bank (NPDB) The Committee recommendation includes $18,814,000 for the NPDB, the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The NPDB is a workforce tool that col-lects and discloses information to authorized entities on past ad-verse actions of health care practitioners, providers, and suppliers to reduce fraud and abuse and improve health care quality. MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $943,784,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 919,018,000 ............................................................. 980,784,000 Change from ......................................................... +37,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +61,766,000 The mission of the Maternal and Child Health Bureau is to im- prove the physical and mental health, safety, and well-being of the Nation's women, infants, children, adolescents, and their families. Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT). \u2014In fiscal years 2017 and 2018, the committee provided $200,000 to CDC to sup-port a collaborative pilot model that enables up to three existing Federally-funded Hemophilia Treatment Centers (HTC) to serve as specialty centers for the evaluation and management of HHT. If proven effective, these joint HTC-HHT Centers have the potential to provide critical diagnostic and treatment services to both hemo-philia and HHT populations. The Committee encourages HRSA to work closely with CDC and stakeholder organizations to track the progress of this pilot initiative for potential replication. Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Block Grant The Committee recommends $712,700,000 for the MCH Block Grant, $25,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $48,000,000 below the fiscal year 2021 budget request. States use the MCH Block Grant to improve access to care for mothers, chil-dren, and their families; reduce infant mortality; provide pre- and post-natal care; support screening and health assessments for chil-dren; and provide systems of care for children with special health care needs. Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Pro- gram. \u2014The Committee recognizes that good oral health is an im- portant component for improving the health and well-being of chil-dren and families. The Committee encourages HRSA to explore op-portunities to integrate oral health in the agency's Home Visiting Program and provide the home visitors with the training to become a Community Dental Health Coordinator. The Committee also en-courages HRSA to work with oral health initiatives such as Com-munity Dental Health Coordinators that have already been initi-ated by dental organizations to provide dental education, commu-nity-based prevention, care coordination, and patient navigation to children and vulnerable families. Special Projects of Regional and National Significance The Committee continues bill language identifying specific amounts for Special Projects of Regional and National Significance (SPRANS). The Committee provides the following within SPRANS: VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul for Fetal Alcohol Syndrome ........................................................................................... ................. 1,000,000 State Oral Health Programs. \u2014The Committee continues to in- clude $250,000 to continue demonstration projects to increase the implementation of integrating oral health and primary care prac-tice. The projects should model the core clinical oral health com-petencies for non-dental providers that HRSA published and ini-tially tested in its 2014 report Integration of Oral Health and Pri- mary Care Practice. The Committee encourages the Chief Dental Officer to continue to direct the design, monitoring, oversight, and implementation of these projects. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) Set-Aside. \u2014Recognizing that as many as one in 20 school-age children are affected by fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), yet few have access to essential diag-nostic and multidisciplinary services, the Committee includes no less than the fiscal year 2020 level for HRSA to continue activities funded by the FAS set-aside. The Committee also encourages HRSA to consider support for an established FASD-specific na-tional network to improve the well-being of children and families with FASD. Adverse Childhood Experiences. \u2014The Committee is aware that childhood trauma and toxic stress have been linked to negative health outcomes through adulthood, including higher rates of dia-betes, stroke, depression, lapses in cognitive abilities, and develop-mental delays, suicide, and substance misuse, among others. The Committee recognizes that promoting awareness to parents and health care providers around the impact of trauma on the devel-oping brain and the importance of encouraging supportive and re-sponsive relationships with caring adults as two promising strate-gies. The Committee supports efforts to improve child health by de-veloping screening protocols and evidence-based interventions to in-dividuals suffering from adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) such as child abuse and neglect, witnessing interpersonal violence, fam-ily substance abuse, family separation, parental divorce, parental loss, and mental illness, to promote developmental resiliency. The end goal of such efforts should be to yield a model for integrating ACEs screening and trauma-informed onsite services into primary care settings. The Committee includes $1,000,000 within SPRANS to fund a study focused on improving child health by implementing screening protocols and evidence-based interventions to individuals who have experienced adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) such as child abuse and neglect, witnessing interpersonal violence, family sub-stance abuse, family separation, parental divorce, parental loss, and mental illness, to promote developmental resiliency. The end goal of the study should be to yield a model for integrating ACEs screening and trauma-informed strength based care into primary care settings. The Committee directs HRSA to submit a report with the results of this study to the Committee within three years of en-actment of this Act. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul Maternal Health Safety Bundles. \u2014The Committee includes $7,000,000, an increase of $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $8,000,000 below the fiscal year 2021 budg-et request, to expand implementation of the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health program's maternal safety bundles to all U.S. States, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories, and tribal enti-ties. Maternal safety bundles are a set of targeted and evidence- based best practices that, when implemented, improve patient out-comes and reduce maternal mortality and severe maternal mor-bidity. Children's Health and Development. \u2014The Committee continues to provide $3,500,000 to continue studies focused on identifying interventions that could result in systemic change that would posi-tively impact the policy of child-health-related institutions and sys-tems in States with the highest levels of childhood poverty. Hemophilia Treatment Centers. \u2014The Committee provides $4,800,000 for Hemophilia Treatment Centers, the same as the fis-cal year 2020 enacted level. The Regional Hemophilia Network Pro-gram uses a regional infrastructure of hemophilia treatment cen-ters to promote and improve the comprehensive care of individuals with hemophilia and related bleeding disorders or clotting dis-orders. Infant-Toddler Court Teams. \u2014The Committee includes $10,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level, for the fourth year of a cooperative agreement to support research-based infant-toddler court teams to change child welfare practices to im-prove well-being for infants, toddlers, and their families. The Com-mittee encourages HRSA to use these funds to: (1) build upon the work of sites established or currently supported through the Infant- Toddler Court Program, including by providing training, technical assistance, and additional support for such court teams' efforts across the country; and (2) plan and support additional infant-tod-dler court teams. Maternal Mental Health Hotline .\u2014The U.S. suffers from one of the highest maternal death rates in the developed world. Suicide and overdose have been identified as the leading causes of death during the first year postpartum and depression is the most com-mon complication of pregnancy in the first year postpartum. To help address these issues, the Committee includes $3,000,000 to contract with a qualified entity to establish and maintain a mater-nal mental health hotline to be staffed by qualified counselors, 24 hours a day. Funding may also be used for outreach to raise aware-ness about maternal mental health issues and the hotline. State Maternal Health Innovation Grants. \u2014The Committee in- cludes $23,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2019 enacted level, for State Maternal Health Innovation Grants that will establish demonstrations to implement evidence-based interventions to ad-dress critical gaps in maternity care service delivery and reduce maternal mortality. The demonstrations will be representative of the demographic and geographic composition of communities most affected by maternal mortality. Maternal and Child Health Programs In addition to the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant, the Maternal and Child Health Bureau supports several programs to VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, improve the health of all mothers, children, and their families. These programs support activities that develop systemic mecha-nisms for the prevention and treatment of sickle cell disease; pro-vide information and research on and promote screening of autism and other developmental disorders; provide newborn and child screening of heritable disorders; provide grants to reduce infant mortality and improve perinatal outcomes; fund States to conduct newborn hearing screening; and provide grants to improve existing emergency medical services. Within the total for Maternal and Child Health Programs, the Committee recommends the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2021 Committee Sickle Cell Anemia Program ..................................................................................................... ...................... Services for Children ........................................................................................ .............. Screening and Treatment for Maternal Depression. ............................................................................... ....... 5,000,000 Pediatric Mental Health Access ................................................................................................. .................... 10,000,000 Autism and Other Developmental Disorders The Committee recommends $53,344,000 for Autism and Other Developmental Disorders, $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 en-acted level and $53,344,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget re-quest. These programs seek to improve the health and well-being of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder and other developmental disabilities and to advance best practices for the early identification and treatment of autism and related devel-opmental disabilities. Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Related Dis- abilities (LEND). \u2014The Committee provides $36,245,000, $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level, for the LEND program to allow the existing 52 LEND sites to maintain their ca-pacity to train interdisciplinary professionals to screen, diagnose, and provide evidence-based interventions to individuals with au-tism spectrum disorder and other developmental disabilities. (ASD/ DD) as authorized by the Autism CARES Act. This funding will en-able the LEND network to fulfill its expanded statutory mandate to train interdisciplinary providers who will serve individuals across the lifespan, addressing a critical shortage of health care professionals for adults with autism and other developmental dis-abilities. This funding will also enable the LEND network to assist in ongoing developmental monitoring, especially for children im-pacted by pressing public health crises, such as opioids, lead and other environmental toxins, the Zika virus, COVID-19, and other new or emerging issues, with resulting complications. The LENDs are a strong community link to services and supports for these newest members of the disability community and their families. This funding is critical to the LEND's role in providing direct clin-ical assessment and evidence-based interventions. In addition, the funding will allow these programs to develop innovative strategies to integrate and enhance existing investments, including trans-lating research findings on interventions, guidelines, tools, and sys- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul interdisciplinary training set- tings, to communities, and into practice, and promote life-course considerations\u2014from developmental screening in early childhood to transition to adulthood issues. Heritable Disorders The Committee provides $21,883,000 for the Heritable Disorders program, $4,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $21,883,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This pro-gram supports activities that strengthen the newborn screening system to ensure infants born in every State receive rapid identi-fication, early intervention, and potentially life-saving treatment. Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (SCID). \u2014Within the total amount for Heritable Disorders, the Committee provides $3,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level, to sup-port wider implementation, education, and awareness of newborn screening and follow-up for SCID and other newborn screening dis-orders. The Committee applauds HRSA's ongoing work to ensure screening of all newborns for Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (SCID), including through initiatives that help parents of newborns diagnosed with SCID understand the disease and treatment op-tions and to navigate the path forward. The Committee encourages HRSA to support efforts to develop telehealth approaches to link families in rural and underserved communities with support and resources, engage providers in education or training related to SCID, and establish mechanisms to obtain long-term outcomes in-formation on infants with SCID through newborn screening. Healthy Start The Committee recommends $130,500,000 for the Healthy Start program, $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The program provides grants to communities with high rates of infant mortality to support pri-mary and preventive health care services for mothers and their in-fants. Maternal Mortality. \u2014The Committee recognizes the rising ma- ternal mortality rate in the U.S. as a pressing public health issue. Analysis of maternal mortality review committee data indicates that over 60 percent of pregnancy-related deaths are preventable. The Committee continues to provide no less than $15,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request, for Healthy Start grantees to support nurse practi-tioners, certified nurse midwives, physician assistants, and other maternal-child advance practice health professionals within all pro-gram sites nationwide. Clinical staff will provide direct access to well-woman care and maternity care services to reduce barriers in access to maternity care and help address maternal health dispari-ties among high-risk and underserved women. Clinical staff will also support health educators by conducting training on maternal early warning signs. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, /AIDS PROGRAM Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $2,388,781,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 2,483,781,000 ............................................................. 2,413,781,000 Change from ......................................................... +25,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a570,000,000 In addition to the funds above, the CARES Act included $90,000,000 for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program to prevent and respond to coronavirus and maintain care for patients. The Ryan White Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Im- munodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) program funds activities to address the care and treatment of persons living with HIV/AIDS who are either uninsured or underinsured and need assistance to obtain treatment. The program provides grants to States and eligi-ble metropolitan areas to improve the quality, availability, and co-ordination of health care and support services to include access to HIV-related medications; grants to service providers for early inter-vention outpatient services; grants to organizations to provide care to HIV infected women, infants, children, and youth; and grants to organizations to support the education and training of health care providers. Within the total for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program, the Committee provides the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2021 Committee Emergency Comprehensive .................. 1,315,005,000 ............................................................................................................. 900,313,000 Early Intervention Program ..................................................................................................... ........................ 201,079,000 Children, Youth, AIDS Dental Services Training Centers ................................................................................................. Projects of National Domestic HIV Initiative ........................................................................................................ ........................... 95,000,000 Ending the HIV Epidemic Initiative. \u2014The Committee includes $95,000,000 within the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program for the EHE Initiative, an increase of $25,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $70,000,000 below the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This investment builds on an increase of $70,000,000 included in fiscal year 2020, bringing the two-year in-vestment in Ryan White for the EHE Initiative to a total of $165,000,000. Funds are distributed to high-need jurisdictions to increase linkage, engagement, and retention in care with the goal of increasing viral suppression among people living with HIV. HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $123,593,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 115,418,000 ............................................................. 129,093,000 Change from ......................................................... +5,500,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +3,060,000 In addition to the funds above, the CARES Act included $5,000,000 to support increased demand for services from Poison Control Centers. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, The Health Care Systems Bureau supports national activities that enhance health care delivery in the U.S., including maintain-ing a national system to allocate and distribute donor organs to in-dividuals awaiting transplant; building an inventory of cord blood units; maintaining a national system for the recruitment of bone marrow donors; operating the 340B drug discount program; and op-erating a national toll-free poison control hotline. Within the total for Health Care Systems, the Committee pro- vides the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2021 Committee Organ Inventory .................................................................................................. Young Cell Transplantation Office of Pharmacy to Hawaii ..................................................................................................... .................... 1,857,000 The Committee includes $33,049,000 for the Organ Transplan- tation program, $5,500,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $2,500,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Maximizing Deceased Donor Organ Recovery, Acceptance, and Utilization. \u2014The Committee supports the goal of significantly in- creasing kidney transplants, established by the President's Execu-tive Order on Advancing American Kidney Health, and supports ef-forts to establish objective outcome measures for Organ Procure-ment Organizations (OPO) as well as efforts to decertify underper-forming OPOs at the conclusion of the current contract cycles. The Committee encourages HHS and HRSA to monitor transplant cen-ter listing and acceptance practices as recorded with the Organ and Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), and to make publicly available its findings based on one calendar year of data. The listed screening criteria for each patient receiving an organ offer should be compared to center refusals codes for those organs not accepted for transplant by the patient's transplant center. Fur-ther, the utilization rates by center should be reported for all organ offers and for both the brain dead and donation after circulatory death subcategories. The Committee supports HHS's Request for Information for the technology system over which these organ of-fers are facilitated and encourages HHS to promote competition for this contract. Reimbursement of Travel and Subsistence Expenses Toward Liv- ing Organ Donation Program. \u2014The Committee includes $10,000,000, an increase of $5,500,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $500,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget re-quest, for expansion of the program administered via the National Living Donor Assistance Center to reimburse a comprehensive range of living donor expenses for the greatest possible number of donors, including lost wages, childcare, eldercare, similar expenses for donor caretakers, and removing other disincentives to donation. The Committee supports significant expansion of income eligibility for the program to allow as many donors as possible to qualify and VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, to ensure that financial reimbursement and monetary exchange take place outside of the organ donor-organ recipient relationship to the greatest extent possible. Office of Pharmacy Affairs The Committee includes $10,238,000 for the Office of Pharmacy Affairs, the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fis-cal year 2021 budget request. The Committee recognizes 340B re-mains important and allows providers to stretch scarce Federal re-sources to reach more eligible patients and provide comprehensive services. The 340B drug pricing program was designed to help safe-ty net providers maintain, improve, and expand patient access to healthcare services. The 340B program has lowered the cost of out-patient drugs to health clinics and nonprofit and public hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income and rural pa-tients. These entities provide additional services and benefits to their communities with the savings realized. The Committee acknowledges the request for additional regu- latory authority and notes that HRSA already has existing over-sight authority that allows the agency to conduct audits of stake-holders who participate in the program to ensure compliance. The Committee recognizes that HRSA has used this authority to con-duct 1,300 audits of covered entities, but only 20 audits of manu-facturers. The Committee is concerned that HRSA is not using their existing oversight authority to pursue balanced oversight of both providers and drug manufacturers. We encourage HRSA to use its existing oversight authority to pursue more balanced over-sight of both providers and manufacturers to ensure compliance and integrity of the 340B program. Poison Control Centers In addition to the amounts provided in this bill, the CARES Act included $5,000,000 for Poison Control Centers to accommodate in-creased demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. RURAL HEALTH Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $318,294,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 246,834,000 ............................................................. 334,294,000 Change from ......................................................... +16,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +87,460,000 In addition to the funds above, the CARES Act included $180,000,000 for Rural Health programs to expand telehealth and support rural hospitals amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The Federal Office of Rural Health Policy's programs provide funding to improve access, quality, and coordination of care in rural communities; for research on rural health issues; for technical assistance and recruitment of health care providers; for screening activities for individuals affected by the mining, transport, and processing of uranium; for the outreach and treatment of coal min-ers and others with occupation-related respiratory and pulmonary impairments; and for the expansion of telehealth services. Within the total for Rural Health activities, the Committee pro- vides the following amounts: VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 $79,500,000 Rural Flexibility Grants .............................................................................................. Offices of Rural Black Lung Clinics ............................................................................................................. Program 11,000,000 Rural Health Liaison. \u2014The Committee directs HRSA to submit a report to the Committee describing how HRSA is coordinating with the Department of Agriculture Rural Health Liaison within 180 days of enactment of this Act. GAO Study on Obstetrics (OB) Closures. \u2014According to the Rural Health Research Gateway, between 2004 and 2014, 179 rural coun-ties lost hospital-based OB services. The Committee directs the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to submit a report on ways to improve access to obstetrics care in rural areas and pre-vent OB unit hospital closures in rural areas. Rural Health Outreach Programs Community Health Workers. \u2014The Committee recognizes the im- portance of community health workers, particularly in rural and underserved areas, to help address persistent health issues tied to social determinants of health. The Committee is aware that many States would like to better incorporate community health workers into their systems, but there is currently a lack of a unified train-ing and certification resource available to them. The Committee en-courages HRSA to consider supporting a national center, based at an academic medical center with expertise in integrating commu-nity health workers into health systems, to assist States and pro-viders through workshops, consultations, certifications and con-tinuing education credits. Southwest States Rural Development Network Grant Program. \u2014 The Committee encourages HRSA to consider funding a new South-west States Rural Development Network Grant Program, within the Southwest Border Region as defined by 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 15732, to promote the development of integrated health care networks in order to: (1) achieve efficiencies; (2) expand access to, coordinate, and improve the quality of essential health care services; and (3) strengthen the rural health care system as a whole. The Com-mittee also encourages HRSA to consider a pilot program to help underserved rural communities in the region identify and better address their health care needs and to help small rural hospitals improve their financial and operational performance. Rural Health Research and Policy Development Telementoring Training Center. \u2014The Committee continues to include $1,000,000 within the total for Rural Health Research and Policy Development to support a telementoring training center to train academic med-ical centers and other centers of excellence in the creation of tech-nology-enabled telementoring learning programs that facilitate the dissemination of best practice specialty care to primary care pro-viders and care teams across the country. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, Health Flexibility Grants The Committee includes $55,609,000 for Rural Health Flexibility Grants, $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $55,609,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Small Rural Hospital Improvement Program (SHIP). \u2014The Com- mittee recommendation includes $21,942,000 for SHIP, an increase of $2,000,000 over the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $21,942,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Telehealth The Committee includes $42,000,000 for Telehealth, $13,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. In addition to the amounts provided in this bill, the CARES Act included $15,000,000 for the Telehealth program to expand services amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Rural Telemedicine Projects. \u2014The Committee strongly supports expanded use of effective and secure telemedicine platforms and re-mote capabilities to provide expanded health care and related be-havior health monitoring and surveillance services in areas that have been hard hit by the opioid epidemic and related substance use disorders. Such technology is needed to augment care and pro-vide access to high quality medical services and monitoring capa-bilities that decrease geographic barriers and reduce the cost of care, especially for individuals at risk for incarceration and recidi-vism. To bolster current efforts and address current and antici-pated needs surrounding infections disease outbreaks such as the novel coronavirus of 2019, as well as other medication-assisted treatments and related mental health monitoring services, the Committee supports efforts that use telemedicine platforms to ex-pand access to rural regions and communities disproportionately impacted by the lack of much needed health care delivery services. Technology-Enabled Collaborative Learning Capacity Building Models Grants. \u2014The Committee includes $10,000,000 within the total for Telehealth to support grants to connect specialists at aca-demic medical centers with primary care providers in rural and un-derserved areas, providing evidence-based training and support to help them treat patients with complex conditions in their commu-nities. Telehealth Centers of Excellence. \u2014The Committee recommenda- tion includes $7,000,000, an increase of $1,000,000 over the fiscal year 2020 enacted level, to support the continued development of Telehealth Centers of Excellence. Telehealth can provide rural pa-tient access to quality primary and specialty care that would other-wise require patients to travel long distances for diagnosis and treatment. Many States have invested in telehealth networks in order to provide rural, medically underserved areas with access to primary and emergency care. Specialists from a central location can help rural providers with critical care for stroke and heart at-tack that can literally mean the difference between life and death. The Centers of Excellence serve to promote the adoption of tele-health programs across the country by validating technology, estab-lishing training protocols, and by providing a comprehensive tem-plate for States to integrate telehealth into their State health pro-vider network. Additional funding for the Centers of Excellence will VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, promote the adoption of telehealth services nation-wide and thus address the access to care issue faced by rural America. Rural Health Residency Program The Committee includes $11,000,000 for Rural Health Residency Program, $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $11,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Rural Residency Planning and Development Program. \u2014The Com- mittee commends the Office of Rural Health Policy for its efforts to expand the physician workforce in rural areas and supports con-tinuation and expansion of the program to develop new rural resi-dency programs, or Rural Training Tracks (RTTs). The Committee encourages HRSA to expand the current program to include RTTs in obstetrics and gynecology. Women in rural communities are more likely to begin prenatal care late and are more likely to expe-rience maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity. The ex-pansion of this program would align with the agency's goals of im-proving maternal health outcomes and eliminating preventable ma-ternal mortality. FAMILY PLANNING Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $286,479,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 286,479,000 Committee Recommendation ............................................................. 286,479,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... - - - Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - The Committee includes $286,479,000 for the Family Planning program, the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the 2021 budget request. The Family Planning program administers Title X of the Public Health Service Act. This program plays a vital role not only in ensuring access to affordable contraceptive edu-cation, services, and supplies, but also in STD prevention, screen-ing, and treatment; cervical and breast cancer screenings; first-line infertility services; and other community and health care services. The bill includes language directing the Secretary to carry out the Title X Family Planning program in accordance with the regu-lations that were in place on January 18, 2017 and provide new grants to grantees whose awards were relinquished or terminated before the planned end of the performance period in fiscal year 2019. The Committee directs the Secretary to ensure that grantees certify that they: (1) provide medically accurate and complete coun-seling, including referral as requested, on all matters; (2) shall not condition the receipt of Title X-supported services on patients re-maining sexually abstinent until marriage; and (3) will not make any appointments or referrals for patients that are contrary to the patient's wishes. PROGRAM MANAGEMENT Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $155,300,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 151,993,000 Committee Recommendation ............................................................. 155,300,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... - - - Change from budget request ...................................................... +3,307,000 Program management supports the cost of Federal staff and re- lated activities to coordinate, direct, and manage the programs of HRSA. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul Officer. \u2014The Committee is pleased that HRSA has restored the position of Chief Dental Officer (CDO) and looks for-ward to learning how the agency has ensured that the CDO is functioning at an executive level authority with resources and staff to oversee and lead all oral health programs and initiatives across HRSA. The Committee requests an update by February 2021 on how the CDO is serving as the agency representative with execu-tive level authority on oral health issues to international, national, State and/or local government agencies, universities, and oral health stakeholder organizations. Investments in Impoverished Areas. \u2014The Committee supports targeted investments in impoverished areas, particularly in per-sistent poverty counties and in other high-poverty census tracts. To understand how programs funded through HRSA are serving these particular areas, the Committee directs HRSA to submit a report to the Committee on the percentage of funds allocated by all com-petitive grant programs and other anti-poverty programs in fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020 and estimates for fiscal year 2021 to serve individuals living in persistent poverty counties, as defined as a county that has had 20 percent or more of its population living in poverty over the past 30 years, as measured by the 1990 and 2000 decennial censuses and the most recent Small Area Income and Poverty estimates, or any territory or possession of the U.S., and high-poverty areas, as defined as any census tract with a pov-erty rate of at least 20 percent as measured by the 2014-2018 5- year data series available from the American Community Survey of the Census Bureau. HRSA shall report this information to the Committee within 90 days of such data being available and provide a briefing to the Committee not later than 180 days of enactment of this Act on how HRSA is carrying out this directive. In the case of any program for which at least 10 percent of the funds allocated in fiscal year 2020 were not allocated to persistent poverty counties or for which the percentage allocated to high-poverty areas in fiscal year 2020 was less than the average percentage of Federal assist-ance allocated to high-poverty areas awarded under the program in fiscal years 2017, 2018, and 2019, such report and briefing shall ex-plain why such a benchmark is unable to be met. Oral Health Literacy. \u2014The Committee includes $300,000 to con- tinue the development of an oral health awareness and education campaign across relevant HRSA divisions, including the Health Centers Program, Oral Health Workforce, Maternal and Child Health, Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, and Rural Health. The Committee directs HRSA to identify oral health literacy strategies that are evidence-based and focused on oral healthcare prevention and education, including prevention of oral disease such as early childhood and other caries, periodontal disease, and oral cancer. The Committee encourages the Chief Dental Officer to play a key role in the design, monitoring, oversight, and implementation of this project. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $7,749,554,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 7,056,264,000 ............................................................. 7,981,654,000 Change from ......................................................... +232,100,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +925,390,000 The Committee recommendation for the Centers for Disease Con- trol and Prevention (CDC) program level includes $7,070,146,000 in discretionary budget authority, $55,358,000 in mandatory funds under the terms of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act, and $856,150,000 in transfers from the Prevention and Public Health (PPH) Fund. In addition, the Committee includes $9,000,000,000 in emergency appropriations for CDC programs and activities, including emer-gency appropriations for State and local health departments, State and local public health laboratories, global health and global dis-ease detection, vaccination campaigns, public health data mod-ernization, public health workforce development, and the Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund. The emergency appropria-tion is further described under Title VI of this committee report. Further, the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supple- mental Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-123) included $2,200,000,000; the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $4,300,000,000; and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (P.L. 116-139) included $1,000,000,000 for CDC to support public health and emergency response activities, domestically and inter-nationally, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. CDC's mission is to protect Americans from health, safety, and security threats, which it accomplishes by supporting core public health functions at State, local, and Tribal health departments, de-tecting and responding to new and emerging health threats, pro-moting health and safety, and providing leadership in the public health workforce. CDC Guidance for COVID-19. \u2014The Committee recognizes that CDC does not have independent regulatory authority. However, the Committee strongly urges CDC to work closely with State and local health departments, as well as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, to ensure that State and local health regulations are aligned with CDC guidance for mask wearing, schools and day camps, child care programs, employers with workers at high risk, restaurants and bars, mass transit, crowded public events, and any other CDC guidance intended to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. IMMUNIZATION AND RESPIRATORY DISEASES Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $790,005,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 830,005,000 ............................................................. 840,005,000 Change from ......................................................... +50,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +10,000,000 The Committee recommendation includes $469,705,000 in discre- tionary budget authority and $370,300,000 in transfers from the PPH Fund. Immunization cooperative agreements are awarded to State and local public health departments for planning, developing, and con-ducting childhood, adolescent, and adult immunization programs, VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, including enhancement of the vaccine delivery infrastructure. CDC directly maintains a stockpile of vaccines, supports consolidated purchase of vaccines for State and local health agencies, and con-ducts surveillance, investigations, and research into the safety and efficacy of new and presently used vaccines. Within the total for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, the Committee recommends the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2021 Committee Section 317 Immunization Program Flaccid Myelitis. \u2014The Committee includes $10,000,000 to identify the cause, prevention, and treatment of acute flaccid myeli-tis, a rare but serious condition that affects the nervous system. Cost Estimates. \u2014The Committee looks forward to reviewing the fiscal year 2022 report on estimated funding needs of the Section 317 Immunization Program and urges that the report be updated and submitted not later than February 1, 2021. The updated report should include an estimate of optimum State and local operations funding, as well as a discussion of the role of the 317 Program, as coverage for vaccination under public and private resources con-tinues to evolve. The fiscal year 2022 report should include specific information on the estimated cost to fully address evidence-based public health strategies that could be funded through CDC to im-prove coverage for human papillomavirus and influenza. Immunization Rates. \u2014As communities follow stay-at-home or- ders to reduce transmission of the coronavirus, there have been re-ductions in vaccination coverage that leave young children and communities vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases. The Com-mittee is concerned that areas where immunization rates have fall-en below the threshold necessary to prevent future outbreaks put the public health at risk. The Committee believes that it is impor-tant to public health to increase the rate at which people in the U.S. choose to vaccinate themselves and their children. Within the funding provided, the Committee supports CDC's efforts to under-stand and address obstacles to vaccination including access, hesi-tancy and misinformation. Influenza Planning and Response. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $40,000,000 to enhance CDC's influenza activities, in-cluding expanding vaccine effectiveness monitoring and evaluation, and increasing influenza vaccine acceptance by removing barriers to vaccination and promoting vaccination coverage. The Committee is very concerned about the 2020-2021 influenza season and the impact of the double wave of influenza and COVID-19. Influenza Vaccine. \u2014The Committee encourages CDC to consider including vaccines produced through recombinant DNA technology in addition to traditionally-produced vaccines in future solicitations to facilitate the competitive process for all vaccine manufacturers. Measles Immunization. \u2014The Committee recognizes the growing risk with measles and its impact on the Pacific Region. The Com-mittee urges CDC to work through emergency responders, Centers of Excellence, Community Health Centers, and other applicable VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, providers to provide education and training on proper protocols to prevent and treat measles, including immunization. Respiratory Syncytial Virus. \u2014The Committee applauds the ongo- ing development of passive and active immunization candidates for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) which is the leading cause of infant hospitalization, a major cause of outpatient and emergency medical visits in the U.S. and for which there is no current preventive measure available for use in infants, except for high risk. As new vaccines and immunoprophylaxis products are in the late stages of development, it is important to have robust infor-mation on the existing burden of RSV to properly evaluate the ben-efit to patients and the healthcare system. Therefore, the Com-mittee encourages CDC to continue to explore surveillance ap-proaches with the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. Section 317 Immunization Program. \u2014The Committee views the 317 Immunization Program, including the Vaccines for Children Program, as a pivotal part of the U.S. public health infrastructure. The Committee is aware that public health experts expect SARS- CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, to continue to circulate in the U.S. during the fall 2020 and winter 2020-2021. While the timing of availability of a vaccine to prevent COVID-19 remains unclear, one strategy to decrease stress on the healthcare system is to increase vaccination coverage with seasonal influenza vaccine beginning in early fall 2020. Although the impact of in-creased coverage varies season-to-season, higher influenza vaccine coverage would be expected to result in decreases in doctor visits and hospitalizations during the influenza season, making more ca-pacity available for persons with COVID-19. In order to reduce health care utilization for influenza and protect populations vulner-able to severe COVID-19 outcomes, CDC should launch an en-hanced influenza campaign in time for the 2020-21 season, includ-ing messages targeting those at higher risk for COVID-19. In addi-tion, in order to prepare for a national SARS-CoV-2 vaccination program, the Committee urges CDC to initiate planning and ex-pansion of vaccination infrastructure in coordination with State, local, territorial and tribal public health authorities. Shared Clinical Decision Making. \u2014The Committee encourages CDC to work with Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC) to provide further explanation and guidelines around the recommendation of shared clinical decision-making in the context of immunizing older adult populations, and develop and disseminate guidance and re-sources to help to ensure that medical professionals and patients continue to have a clear understanding of and continued access to the immunizations they should receive across the lifespan. The Committee further encourages the Assistant Secretary for Health to consider appointing Geriatric specialists to the NVAC so that vaccine recommendations will be informed by providers with a his-tory of caring for senior populations. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, , SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES , AND TUBERCULOSIS PREVENTION Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $1,273,556,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 1,552,556,000 ............................................................. 1,287,556,000 Change from ......................................................... +14,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a5265,000,000 CDC provides national leadership and support for prevention re- search and the development, implementation, and evaluation of evidence-based HIV, viral hepatitis, sexually transmitted diseases (STD), and tuberculosis (TB) prevention programs serving persons affected by, or at risk for, these infections. Activities include sur-veillance, epidemiologic and laboratory studies, and prevention ac-tivities. CDC provides funds to State, local, and Tribal health de-partments and community-based organizations to develop and im-plement integrated community prevention plans. Within the total for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, the Committee recommends the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2021 Committee Domestic HIV/AIDS 10,000,000 Community-Based Organizations. \u2014The Committee recognizes that community-based organizations play a crucial role because of their capacity to reach communities highly impacted by HIV. The Committee directs CDC to ensure that Ending the HIV Epidemic advisory groups or committees reflect their local epidemic by in-cluding community-based organizations and people living with HIV. The Committee further requests CDC's progress of engaging such communities be included in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification. Congenital Syphilis. \u2014The Committee is concerned that the cases of congenital syphilis (CS) are at the highest rate in 20 years. The Committee urges CDC to work with State and local authorities to design an initiative that will strengthen prenatal outreach pro-grams. The Committee further urges CDC to increase awareness of CS through community organizations and STD and drug addiction clinics of the importance of multi-testing throughout pregnancy. HIV/AIDS Data Sharing Platform. \u2014The Committee encourages CDC to enhance the Collaborative Advanced Analytics and Data Sharing system to lower overall operating costs and reduce report-ing burdens on Federal and State health departments. HIV Initiative. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $10,000,000. This investment builds on an increase of $140,000,000 included in fiscal year 2020, bringing the two-year investment in CDC's role in the Eliminating HIV/AIDS Initiative to a total of $290,000,000. CDC will focus on areas of the country that con-stitute the majority of new HIV infections annually to diagnose people with HIV as early as possible after infection, link people to effective treatment and prevention strategies, and respond rapidly VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, to clusters and outbreaks of new HIV infections. By working with State and local health departments, along with community-based organizations, there will be intensive testing and rapid referral to care and treatment. The initiative will develop and deploy innova-tive data management solutions, increase access to Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), and improve detection and response to HIV clusters. The Committee recognizes that sexually transmitted dis-eases are associated with increased risk of HIV acquisition. The Committee urges CDC to include an expansion of sexually trans-mitted infections programs and initiatives designed to increase HIV testing; PrEP and condom availability at STD clinics; increase the number of Disease Intervention Specialists to prevent the spread of STIs and HIV; and implement HIV and STI education and preven-tion programs in schools. Historically Black Colleges and Universities. \u2014The Committee en- courages increased engagement with Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Infectious Diseases and the Opioid Epidemic. \u2014The Committee in- cludes funding to strengthen efforts to conduct surveillance to im-prove knowledge of the full scope of the burden of infectious dis-eases (including viral, bacterial and fungal pathogens) associated with substance use disorders, and in collaboration with state and local health departments, health care facilities, and providers, de-ploy existing authorities to prevent and detect infectious diseases associated with substance use disorder and strengthen linkages to addiction, mental health and infectious diseases treatment. The Committee urges CDC to support the development and evaluation of innovative interventions to enable hospitals to link people with opioid-use related infections to community-based treatment and harm reduction services. School Health. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $2,000,000 to bolster school capacity for sexual health education, and access to sexual health services and safe and supportive envi-ronments. Sexually Transmitted Infections. \u2014The Committee includes an in- crease of $2,000,000 in recognition that the number of combined cases of syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia have reached an all- time high in the U.S. The Committee is concerned by the adverse consequences that a rise in STDs has on women, especially during pregnancy. According to CDC, undiagnosed STDs cause infertility in more than 24,000 women each year. Among newborns, Syphilis cases increased by 40 percent, to more than 1,300 cases across the country. The Committee commends CDC for providing resources to state and local health departments for STD prevention and surveil-lance. Sexually Transmitted Diseases Program Administration. \u2014The Committee is concerned regarding CDC's practice of diverting an increasing percentage of STD program dollars away from State and local health departments. While the Committee understands the need to cover basic administrative costs, the percentage being di-verted has continued to rise over the past several years, leaving State and local authorities and the Division of STD Prevention at CDC with fewer resources to address the STI epidemic. Tuberculosis. \u2014The Committee is concerned that there is a lack of resources to reach, test, and treat the millions of people in the VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, who have longstanding latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). The Committee urges CDC to provide additional resources that will enable CDC, along with State and local entities, to expand testing and preventive treatment of individuals with LTBI. Viral Hepatitis and Opioids. \u2014The Committee is concerned that as a result of the opioid crisis, infections of viral hepatitis have spiked at alarming rates in many parts of the nation. The Com-mittee urges CDC to develop a plan for a national chronic hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) surveillance infrastructure and in-crease grant funding to States for viral hepatitis surveillance, test-ing, linkage to care, and hepatitis A (HAV) and HBV vaccination among all populations at risk for infection. The Committee also urges CDC to incorporate infectious disease prevention, testing, and linkage to care into the agency's response to the opioid crisis. Given that HBV and HCV are the most common drivers of liver cancer in the U.S., the incidence and mortality of which are in-creasing more rapidly than any other cancers, the Committee urges that CDC raise awareness of and encourage awardees to address this link. The Committee requests that CDC submit a status report of the above efforts in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justifica-tion. Viral Hepatitis Vaccination. \u2014The Committee is concerned that despite the availability of an effective hepatitis B (HBV) vaccine, less than 25 percent of adults age 19 and older are vaccinated. Ac-cording to CDC's most recent survey of Vaccination Coverage Among Adults, this poor vaccination rate remains flat and has not improved in several years. The Committee recognizes that CDC is evaluating new universal HBV vaccination recommendations in-cluding a comprehensive plan to increase adult HBV vaccinations. CDC is further urged to promote awareness about the importance of HBV vaccination among medical and health professionals, com-munities at high risk, and the general public and to improve col-laboration and coordination across CDC to achieve this goal. Fur-thermore, the Committee recognizes that viral hepatitis can cause serious health consequences for people living with HIV and that 25 percent of people living with HIV are also living with hepatitis C virus (HCV), and about 10 percent of people living with HIV are also living with hepatitis B virus (HBV). The Committee directs CDC to submit a report on the plan to increase the rate of HBV adult vaccination to the levels necessary to eliminate new infec-tions of HBV in the U.S. in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Jus-tification. EMERGING AND ZOONOTIC INFECTIOUS DISEASES Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $635,772,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 550,464,000 ............................................................. 645,972,000 Change from ......................................................... +10,200,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +95,508,000 The Committee recommendation includes $593,972,000 in discre- tionary appropriations and $52,000,000 in transfers from the PPH Fund. Programs funded under Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (EZID) support the prevention and control of infectious diseases through surveillance, outbreak investigation and response, research, and prevention. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, EZID, the Committee recommends the fol- lowing amounts: Budget Advanced Molecular Detection. \u2014The Committee recognizes that the Advanced Molecular Detection (AMD) Initiative provides crit-ical funding for rapid technological innovation, such as genomic se-quencing of pathogens, to allow for better prevention and control of infectious diseases and more rapid identification and character-ization of antibiotic resistant infections. In addition, AMD is help-ing CDC to understand, characterize, and control antibiotic resist-ance and develop and target prevention measures, including vac-cines. Technology being developed in the AMD program will ulti-mately make it possible for state public health officials to take the DNA fingerprint of foodborne bacteria like Salmonella and E coli, understand whether they are antibiotic-resistant, and identify re-lated strains to solve outbreaks, all without relying on the slow and expensive process of clinical culture. Antibiotic Resistance. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $5,000,000. The Committee recognizes the importance of effectively combatting antibiotic resistant bacteria as part of CDC's broader efforts to mitigate the clinical and public health impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak. Furthermore, the Committee recognizes the importance of the addressing the problem of antibiotic-resistant bacteria through a ''One Health'' approach and by tracking resist-ance through local, regional, national, and global surveillance. The Committee encourages CDC to competitively award research activi-ties that address aspects of antibiotic resistance related to ''One Health,'' including global surveillance and research and develop-ment for new tools to counter antibiotic resistance among entities, including public academic medical centers, veterinary schools with agriculture extension services, and public health departments whose proposals are in line with CDC's strategy for addressing an-tibiotic resistant bacteria. Emerging Infectious Diseases. \u2014The Committee recognizes the significant threat that emerging infectious diseases pose for both military and civilian populations and operations. The Committee urges CDC to sustain and optimize infrastructure at existing aca-demic centers for emerging infectious diseases in States with high tourism and vital military assets to ensure preparedness and re-sponse measures for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of emerging infectious diseases. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, \u2014The Committee includes funding to sup- port monitoring and health reporting concerns related to harmful algal blooms (HABs). The Committee urges CDC to continue work on affected waters, with a focus on freshwater and the related dan-gers to drinking water supplies. CDC has a unique role in better understanding the intersection of public health and environmental impacts of HABs to: (1) Increase outreach efforts to States and local public health officials to use these monitoring and reporting systems; (2) work with a variety of agencies that currently collabo-rate on HABs such as the HABARCA Task-Force and the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. The scope of future research may ex-pand to include improving laboratory methods for HAB-related tox-ins in biological specimens and clinical diagnostic methods to iden-tify HAB-related symptoms and illnesses, optimizing emergency re-sponse capacities, and identifying and addressing the impacts of harmful algal toxins to humans. There is an important nexus be-tween freshwater and health through drinking water and recre-ation, and CDC is encouraged to expand their work regionally to understand HABs impact on our nation's largest fresh bodies of water. Food Safety. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $2,000,000 to help address the critical unmet needs in the nation's food safety system, in part through programs that enhance state and local public health capacity to support vital national surveillance, im-prove foodborne outbreak detection and investigations, enhance food safety prevention efforts, and maintain vigilance for emerging threats to our nation's food supply. Lyme Disease. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $2,000,000 to support CDC's efforts to develop improved diagnostics and surveillance networks so that disease burden can be more accurately determined, and bolster critical prevention and provider and public awareness efforts. Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. \u2014The Committee commends CDC for its recent progress in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) medical edu-cation and in the Multisite Clinical Assessment of ME/CFS (MCAM) study, including the expansion of this study into pediatric research. The Committee is concerned that there is a lack of infor-mation about ME/CFS onset and requests an update in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justification. Mycotic Diseases. \u2014The Committee provides an additional $200,000 in Emerging Infectious Diseases for mycotic diseases, in-cluding, but not limited to, surveillance and prevention, building capacity in the State and local health departments, cooperative agreements, education of the public and healthcare providers, and laboratory support. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justification on how this funding is being utilized. National One Health Framework. \u2014As the coronavirus pandemic has proven, zoonotic diseases pose a significant threat and the Committee recognizes the need to improve the nation's response ca-pacity. The Committee directs CDC to develop a national one- health framework to combat the threat of zoonotic diseases and ad-vance emergency preparedness. The Committee directs the Sec-retary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Agri- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul culture in coordination with the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of the Inte-rior, the Department of Defense, the Department of Commerce, and other departments and agencies as appropriate, to develop, publish, and shall report to the Committee no later than 180 days after en-actment of this Act on a national One Health Framework for co-ordinated Federal Activities. One Health Federal Interagency Coordination Committee. \u2014The Committee directs CDC to work with the Department of Agri-culture and Department of Interior to develop a One Health coordi-nation mechanism at the federal level. This mechanism will be used to strengthen One Health collaboration related to prevention, detection, control, and response for the prioritized zoonotic diseases and related One Health work across the federal government. HHS shall report to the Committee no later than 180 days after enact-ment of this Act on the National One Health Framework and the One Health Coordination Mechanism regarding the steps being taken to implement the recommendations detailed in the U.S. One Health Zoonotic Disease Prioritization Workshop summary, entitled Prioritizing Zoonotic Diseases for Multisectoral, One Health Col-laboration in the U.S. Prion. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $1,000,000 to ad- vance efforts on prion diseases, which occur in both humans and animals, primarily affecting the central nervous system. This group of degenerative neurological disorders is currently incurable and in-variably fatal. CDC supports the only Federally provided resources to monitor human prion diseases in the U.S. The Committee sup-ports these efforts and recognizes the critical work of the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center. The workload related to chronic wasting disease (CWD) in deer and elk populations in the U.S. is in addition to the Center's ongoing efforts related to human prion diseases that includes research, surveillance, tissue banking, and technical and supportive assistance to providers to families. Accordingly, the Committee provides increased funding to support this work. Sepsis. \u2014The Committee is concerned that sepsis continues to be a leading public health threat that is responsible for the death of approximately 270,000 adults and 7,000 children annually in U.S. The Committee encourages CDC to increase coordination within the Department of Health and Human Services, with the Depart-ment of Education, and with the Department of Labor to increase the dissemination of and the utilization of sepsis educational mate-rials, including the Get Ahead of Sepsis Campaign. Coordination should focus on increasing utilization of the campaign by school nurses, company nurses and health care providers. The Committee also encourages enhanced outreach to health departments, aca-demic partners, healthcare providers and systems, professional and quality improvement organizations, and patient representatives to increase utilization of sepsis educational materials, including the Get Ahead of Sepsis Campaign. In addition, the Committee encour-ages CDC to enhance outreach to national, state, and local hospital associations to increase usage of the Get Ahead of Sepsis Campaign and the CDC Sepsis Prevention Toolkit by medical staff. The Com-mittee directs CDC to report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on coordination efforts, utilization rates, and the VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, results of enhanced outreach efforts 180 days after the enactment of this Act. Vector-Borne Disease Centers of Excellence. \u2014The Committee is concerned about the Pacific Northwest being an underserved region for funding and representation in the Regional Centers of Excel-lence in Vector-Borne Diseases network. The ecology, disease trans-mission dynamics, and resources for vector-borne disease training, surveillance, and control in the Northwest differ significantly from those in the five regional centers currently funded. The Committee encourages CDC to examine options to provide greater coverage of the Northwest region for vector-borne disease resources. CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION AND HEALTH PROMOTION Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $1,239,914,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 813,250,000 ............................................................. 1,306,414,000 Change from ......................................................... +66,500,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +493,164,000 The Committee recommendation includes $1,049,564,000 in dis- cretionary appropriations and $256,850,000 in transfers from the PPH Fund. Programs supported within Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (CDPHP) provide national leadership and support for State, Tribal, and community efforts to promote health and well-being through the prevention and control of chronic dis-eases. The recommendation for CDPHP maintains the existing program line items as they were funded in fiscal year 2020 and does not provide funding for the America's Health Block Grant proposed again in the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The Committee sup-ports evidence-based strategies to address public health priorities through proven State-based grant programs, utilizing related na-tional organizations for technical assistance, and encourages CDC to continue and expand these successful approaches. Within the total provided, the Committee recommends the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2021 Committee Tobacco ........................................................................................................................ Physical Activity, ...................................................................................... ..................

Arthritis. \u2014The Committee recognizes the serious issue of arthri- tis in communities across the country, which affects one in four Americans and is the number one cause of disability in the U.S. The Committee commends the ongoing work of the CDC Arthritis Program to provide existing investments in data and intervention and prevention research. The Committee urges CDC to support ro-bust investment to expand the number of state-based arthritis pro-grams, provide access to proven arthritis self-management and physical activity programs, and improve data collection and surveil-lance. The Committee requests a report on the resources necessary to fully scale the Arthritis Program and identify gaps in arthritis public health research and data collection in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justification. Breast and Cervical Cancer. \u2014The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program provides, critical, lifesaving breast cancer screening and diagnostic services to low-income, uninsured and underinsured women, providing exams to more than 5.6 mil-lion women since its creation in 1991, diagnosing nearly 5,000 invasive cervical cancers and 215,000 premalignant cervical le-sions, and almost 70,000 invasive breast cancers. Previous funding levels allowed 15 percent of women eligible for breast cancers screening and approximately 7 percent of women eligible for cer-vical cancer screening to be served. The Committee encourages CDC to work with States and stakeholders to implement strategies to maximize the number of women in the program. Chronic Disease Education and Awareness. \u2014The Committee rec- ognizes CDC's work with stakeholders to expand public health edu-cation and awareness activities that help to improve surveillance, diagnosis, and proper treatment for chronic diseases. The Com- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, establish a Chronic Disease Edu- cation and Awareness competitive grant program to expand and advance CDC's work with stakeholders on education, outreach, and public awareness activities for a variety of chronic diseases for which there is a clear disparity in public and professional aware-ness that are not already specified under CDC in this report. This approach would utilize a competitive grant process to strengthen the science base for prevention, education, and public health awareness for a variety of chronic diseases, such as lymphatic dis-eases, that do not currently have dedicated resources that would lead to meaningful patient outcomes. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. \u2014The Committee urges CDC to do more to address Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), the nation's fourth leading cause of death, including fully engaging with the timely implementation of the COPD National Action Plan, developed by the National Heart, Lung, Blood Insti-tute in coordination with CDC, such as fully integrating COPD sur-veillance, research, prevention, and management strategies into ex-isting chronic disease efforts. The Committee requests a written re-port on the updates to the COPD Action Plan no later than 180 days after enactment of this Act. Chronic Pain. \u2014The Committee previously encouraged CDC to analyze data collected from the chronic pain questions included in the 2017 National Health Interview Survey and to clarify the inci-dence and prevalence of various pain syndromes differentiated by patient age, comorbidities, socioeconomic status, race and gender. The Committee also encouraged CDC to collect data on direct and indirect costs of pain treatment and the effectiveness of evidence- based treatment approaches (S. Rept. 115-150\u2014Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriation Bill, 2018). In light of the issuance of the HHS Pain Management Best Practices Task Force report identi-fying gaps in access to care, and the importance of utilizing inter-ventional procedures such as nerve blocks, injections and surgical devices; behavioral health approaches such as cognitive behavioral therapy; and complementary and integrative health therapies such as massage therapy and acupuncture to address pain, the Com-mittee again encourages CDC to collect this needed data and pub-lish it annually. Furthermore, the Committee directs CDC to pro-vide an update on pain statistics in the fiscal year 2022 Congres-sional Justification. Colorectal Cancer. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $1,000,000 for colorectal cancer. The Committee is concerned with the increasing rate of colorectal cancer among younger adults. The Committee urges CDC to identify risk factors that may be associ-ated with this increase among younger adults and further identify trends of increase by race and socioeconomic status. Diabetes. \u2014The Committee includes funding to prevent diabetes, its complications, and to reduce inequities through prevention strategies, translational research, and education. The Committee also includes an increase of $3,000,000 for the Diabetes Prevention Program to expand efforts of this public-private partnership that provides diabetes prevention for people with prediabetes. The Com-mittee encourages CDC to support diabetes screening programs lo-cated in hospital settings. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul Product Use\u2014Associated Lung Injury. \u2014 The Committee remains concerned about the impacts of utilizing e- cigarettes or vaping products that lead to hospitalizations and deaths across the country. The Committee requests an update of CDC's findings relating to this topic in the fiscal year 2022 Con-gressional Justification. Early Child Care Collaboratives. \u2014The Committee recognizes that the early care and education setting is important for pro-moting healthy habits in young children. The Committee includes funding for the National Early Child Care Collaboratives Program to support direct provider-level training in implementation of com-prehensive programming to support healthy eating and physical ac-tivity best practices and technical assistance to States for inte-grating such best practices into existing State and local systems for early care and education. Eating Disorders. \u2014The Committee encourages CDC to assist States in collecting data by including standard questions on unhealthy weight control practices for eating disorders, including binge eating, through the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Sys-tem and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Epilepsy. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $1,000,000 to support epidemiologic studies, national dissemination of evidence- based programs to improve access of care and expand provider edu-cation and public awareness campaigns to reduce stigma. Food and Health. \u2014The Committee understands that many chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, asthma, arthritis and inflammatory diseases, and maternal health and child develop-ment, can be managed cost effectively by improved nutrition. The Committee supports efforts to provide information on how cul-turally appropriate, food-based solutions integrated into the healthcare system, using the latest knowledge in nutrition, can im-prove medical effectiveness resulting in cost savings. Healthy Aging. \u2014The Committee includes $10,000,000 for CDC to expand its healthy aging work to include coordinating healthy aging efforts across the agency, funding applied research and translation for public health practice, and awarding cooperative agreements to build capacity in state, tribal and territorial public health departments to promote the health of older adults within an age-friendly public health system. The Committee recognizes the role of public health in promoting healthy aging. As the nation's population rapidly ages, the U.S. public health system must adapt accordingly. Isolation and loneliness, financial struggles, multiple chronic conditions, including loss of bone density, hearing, decline in vision, and access to transportation, healthy food, and affordable housing are challenges many older people face. Social isolation alone increases the risk of heart disease, infections, depression, cognitive decline and death among older people. The impact of so-cial isolation is particularly important to consider as the U.S. re- sponds to the outbreak of COVID-19. Age-friendly public health interventions can optimize the health and well-being of adults 65 and over, prolong their independence, and reduce their use of ex-pensive healthcare services. Heart Disease and Stroke. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $3,000,000 to support, strengthen, and expand evidence-based VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul initiatives, given that almost half of the U.S. population has some form of cardiovascular disease. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases. \u2014The Committee commends CDC for continuing to support research on the incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in the U.S., including on dis-parities in patterns of care within minority populations. The Com-mittee encourages CDC to begin planning an educational campaign to increase awareness among healthcare providers and patients in order to reduce disparate health outcomes among minority popu-lations with IBD. Interstitial Cystitis. \u2014The Committee requests an update on edu- cation, outreach, and public awareness activities in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justification. Johanna's Law. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $1,000,000 for CDC's Inside Knowledge Campaign that raises awareness of the five main types of gynecological cancer: cervical, ovarian, uterine, vaginal, and vulvar. This campaign educates women of all ages, races, and ethnic groups, and healthcare pro-viders. Kidney Disease. \u2014The Committee is deeply troubled by the sig- nificant and growing burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD), which affects an estimated 37 million Americans. Unfortunately, 90 percent of individuals with CKD are unaware they have the illness, only learning of it when there is a need for dialysis or kidney transplantation. With timely awareness, diagnosis, and treatment, the progression of kidney disease and its comorbidities can be slowed. Lung Cancer. \u2014The Committee remains concerned about the high morbidity and mortality of lung cancer. Early detection and treat-ment of lung cancer translates into higher survival rates, but only 16 percent of lung cancer cases are diagnosed early when the dis-ease is most treatable. The Committee urges CDC to promote lung cancer screening awareness as part of its tobacco prevention and control activities. Nutrition, Physical Activity and Obesity. \u2014The Committee sup- ports CDC's efforts to protect the health of Americans at every stage of life by encouraging regular physical activity, good nutri-tion, and preventing adult and childhood obesity. The Committee is concerned that the eligibility for the High Obesity Program is limited to communities with high obesity rates solely among adults, without taking into account childhood obesity rates. This exclusion represents a missed opportunity to address the important public health problem of childhood obesity, which can lead to high blood pressure, sleep apnea, high cholesterol, fatty liver disease, psycho-logical problems and more. In addition, by focusing only on obesity rates at the county level, the program misses high-risk commu-nities within healthier counties. The Committee encourages that CDC consider including high childhood obesity rates in its eligi-bility criteria for the High Obesity Program, as well as consider opening eligibility to program sites in census tracts with high obe-sity rates. Oral Health. \u2014The Committee is aware that there are some Com- munity Dental Health Coordinators (CDHCs) that serve in school- based settings where they provide oral health education, screenings, cleanings and dental sealants. The Committee encour- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 CDC to engage federal partners, external stakeholders, includ- ing current and former grantees of the program, to determine how CDHCs can be used to continually educate and provide preventa-tive care in school-based settings. Ovarian Cancer. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $1,000,000 for ovarian cancer, which causes more deaths each year than any other gynecological cancer in the U.S., to advance ovarian cancer prevention, early detection, risk assessment, and access to the standard of care. Prostate Cancer. \u2014The Committee support's CDC's efforts to in- crease the public's awareness of prostate cancer risks, screening and treatment, and improve surveillance of this disease, which is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men and the second lead-ing cause of cancer deaths among men in the U.S. The Committee encourages CDC to increase outreach and education among high- risk men, especially African-American men. Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System for Fathers Pilot. \u2014The Committee is aware of the pilot Pregnancy Risk Assess- ment Monitoring System (PRAMS) for Fathers with state and local public health agencies. Building on the successful PRAMS surveil-lance system that provides data from women during pregnancy and the first few months after birth, the pilot program extending this surveillance to fathers has provided paternal data with immense value for public health interventions. Prevention Research Centers. \u2014The Committee includes funding for the national network committed to conducting prevention re-search and translating research results into policy and public health practice that address local public health needs. Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health. \u2014The Com- mittee includes an increase of $7,000,000 for the only Federal pro-gram addressing the nation's racial and ethnic health disparities. The Committee recommends that all racial and ethnic target popu-lations are represented. The Committee's recommended level in-cludes an increase of $2,000,000 for Good Health and Wellness in Indian Country. Safe Motherhood and Infant Health. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $10,000,000 and recognizes CDC's ongoing efforts to address the pressing public health issue of rising maternal mor-tality rate in the U.S. Black, American Indian and Alaska Native women are two to three times more likely to die from pregnancy- related causes than white women, and this disparity increases with age. The Committee encourages CDC to work with States to estab-lish and continue Maternal Mortality Review Committees, and to provide assistance for all Committees to collect, analyze, and report data collected through the Maternal Mortality Review Information Application (MMRIA) System. CDC is encouraged to analyze the MMRIA data from all States, to the extent possible, issue a report of findings, and provide follow up technical assistance to support States to develop and implement strategies to improve data collec-tion and analysis and to reduce maternal mortality. The Committee requests a report in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justifica-tion, analyzing the necessary costs and resources needed to enable State or regional databases to institute a policy nation-wide of monitoring death records 365 days after a birth record is issued for an individual's newborn. Furthermore, the Committee commends VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul Perinatal Quality Collaboratives (PQCs) that focus on improving maternal and neonatal outcomes using known prevention strategies such as reducing early elective deliveries. CDC is encouraged to continue support for PQCs par-ticularly due to the rise in maternal mortality rates and neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) as a result of the opioid crisis. To maintain the notable work of the PREEMIE CDC-funded state- based PQCs around the country, the Committee urges CDC to ex-pand their work in States disproportionately affected by the opioid crisis and focus efforts in the top five States affected by opioid mis-use. Social Determinants of Health Pilot Program. \u2014The Committee recognizes the role of public health in working across sectors on so-cial determinants of health. The Committee includes $10,000,000 for CDC to establish a Social Determinants of Health pilot program to award competitive grants to State, local, Territorial, or Tribal ju-risdictions to support the development of Social Determinants of Health Accelerator Plans. Such plans should include a description of the health and social outcome objectives of the Social Deter-minants Accelerator Plan; identify target populations that would benefit from implementation of the plan; and identify non-govern-mental public health organizations and community organizations that would participate in the development of the plan. Grantees may use a portion of grant funding to convene government entities and stakeholders and to engage qualified research experts in devel-oping Social Determinants Accelerator Plans. The Committee di-rects CDC to submit a report within 120 days of enactment of this Act on how such grants will be administered. Sudden Unexpected Infant Death and Sudden Unexplained Death in Childhood. \u2014The Committee is aware that currently, there is no known way to prevent sudden unexpected infant death syndrome (SIDS), but there are ways to reduce the risk. Several factors present during pregnancy, at birth, and throughout the first year after birth can impact SIDS risk. The Committee urges CDC to im-prove data and prevention strategies, including by revising stand-ardized death investigation forms, incorporating scene investigation and doll-reenactments. Tobacco. \u2014The Committee is deeply troubled by the dramatic in- crease in e-cigarette use among youth and concurs with the Sur-geon General that youth use of e-cigarettes has reached epidemic levels. The Committee is also concerned that certain populations and regions of the country continue to experience high rates of to-bacco use and are disproportionately burdened by tobacco-related disease and premature death. The Committee urges CDC to con-tinue its efforts to reduce this and other disparities in tobacco use prevalence. Accordingly, the Committee includes an increase of $10,000,000 so that CDC and States can use evidence-based strate-gies to respond to the public health risk caused by the dramatic in-crease of youth use of e-cigarettes, including school-based interven-tions as part of a comprehensive strategy, enhance efforts to reduce tobacco use among certain populations and in areas with high to-bacco use rates and tobacco-related mortality, as well as expand its highly effective Tips from Former Smokers campaign. Tobacco and COVID-19. \u2014The Committee is aware that smoking and use of e-cigarettes harm the lungs, and that researchers and VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, public health officials are increasingly concerned that users of such products may be at increased risk for poorer health outcomes re-lated to COVID-19. The Committee urges CDC to improve the col-lection of data on whether individuals who have tested positive for the novel coronavirus are current smokers, former smokers, or e- cigarette users, and to assess whether smokers and e-cigarette users are at higher risk for developing severe illness and death from COVID-19 than non-users. The Committee urges CDC to begin tracking this information within 90 days of enactment and to make such data and assessments publicly available. Vision and Eye Health. \u2014The Committee includes funding to en- hance programs that prevent blindness and preserve sight. The Committee is aware that vision impairments and eye disease con-tribute to or complicate many other serious and costly chronic health conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, inju-ries and death related to falling, depression, and cognitive decline. State and community-level intervention are vital, as 75 percent of incidents of vision loss are preventable through early detection and treatment. WISEWOMAN. \u2014The Committee recognizes the vital importance of addressing cardiovascular disease among women by raising awareness of rising cardiovascular mortality among women, par-ticularly women of color, and including an increase of $2,000,000 to support a comprehensive public awareness initiative that estab-lishes best practices for identifying and treating cardiovascular in-cidents in women. The Committee further recognizes that the re-sulting costs to the health care system of unrecognized symptoms in the treatment of women can be substantially reduced with ap-propriate public policy and prevention efforts. BIRTH DEFECTS , DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES , DISABILITIES AND HEALTH Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $160,810,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 112,250,000 ............................................................. 162,810,000 Change from ......................................................... +2,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +50,560,000 This account supports efforts to conduct research on and address the causes of birth defects and developmental disabilities, as well as reduce the complications of blood disorders and improve the health of people with disabilities. Within the total, the Committee recommends the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2021 Committee Child Health ............................................................................................................................... .......... with Disabilities ............................................................................ ....... 69,660,000 Disability & Health Tourette Syndrome ............................................................................................................................... .. ............................................................................................................................... 6,000,000 ................... 2,250,000 Surveillance for Emerging Threats to Mothers and Babies ........................................................................ .. 10,000,000 Congenital Heart Defects. \u2014The Committee includes funding for grants or cooperative agreements to provide technical assistance to State and local agencies to complement intramural programs and to conduct applied research related to screening, evaluation, diag-nosis, results reporting, data collection, surveillance, intervention programs, systems, and follow-up of children identified through Critical Congenital Heart Defects (CCHD) screening to better un-derstand the long-term outcomes and needs of this population. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. \u2014The Committee is aware of the development and dissemination of the Duchenne Muscular Dys-trophy Care Considerations. In order to understand their impact, the Committee urges CDC to consider how widely the Care Consid-erations have been adopted across the country and whether this has led to changes in practice or an improvement in patient out-comes, particularly in rural and underserved areas, and the pres-ence of a Certified Duchenne Care Center. Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders .\u2014The Committee is concerned about the rising trend of prenatal alcohol consumption and in-creased rates of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and urges CDC to increase support to: expand prevention efforts to heighten awareness of FASD and the risks associated with prenatal alcohol exposure; and strengthen existing national community-based and professional FASD networks to expand access to diagnostic, treat-ment, intervention, and other essential services. Improving the Health of People with Intellectual Disabilities. \u2014 The Committee includes an increase of $2,000,000 for the expanded provision of year-round, grassroots activities in communities to cre-ate opportunities for health screenings and access to quality healthcare, and health and wellness programming for people with intellectual disabilities. These efforts enhance the lives of individ-uals while eliminating stigmas and stereotypes. Infant and Maternal Health Surveillance .\u2014The Committee di- rects, within 90 days of enactment of this Act, an update on adaptions that have been made to the Surveillance for Emerging Threats to Mothers and Babies Program, Pregnancy Risk Assess-ment Monitoring System, and other infant and maternal health surveillance efforts to evaluate the risks for and effects of COVID- 19 on infants and pregnant and lactating individuals. Pregnancy-Status COVID-19 Data Collection and Reporting. \u2014 The Committee directs, within 90 days of enactment of this Act, a report be submitted describing the specific steps taken to ensure that pregnancy status be included in COVID-19 data collection, documentation, and reporting from health care providers to public VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, health agencies, particularly at the time of the initial or first re- port. Sickle Cell Disease. \u2014The Committee urges the Division of Blood Disorders plan to establish a population-based surveillance system to collect and analyze longitudinal data on people living in the U.S. with sickle cell disease and established a separate budget account for sickle cell disease. Spina Bifida. \u2014The Committee is aware of a growing incidence of sudden death in the adult spina bifida population, and under-stands that there is a significant need to study this issue and to develop medical interventions that lead to optimal outcomes and to address the transitional and adult care needs of the growing, aging Spina Bifida community. Therefore, the Committee encourages CDC to use funding for the National Spina Bifida Program (NSBP) to be used to support the continuation of the Spina Bifida Clinical Care Monitoring and Tracking Program which works with the Na-tional Spina Bifida Registry to guide the health care community in best treatment options for people living with Spina Bifida. PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENTIFIC SERVICES Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $578,497,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 521,000,000 ............................................................. 593,497,000 Change from ......................................................... +15,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +72,497,000 This account supports programs that provide leadership and training for the public health workforce, support infrastructure to modernize public health surveillance, promote and facilitate science standards and policies, and improve access to information on dis-ease outbreaks and other threats. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $500,000,000 for the public health data modernization initiative. Within the total, the Committee recommends the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2021 Committee Health ........................................................................................................ ......................... 56,000,000 Birth Settings. \u2014The Committee notes that the 2020 Consensus Study Report ''Birth Settings in America: Outcomes, Quality, Ac-cess, and Choice'' conducted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine found that ''Modifications to the birth certificate that allow inquiry into birth settings based on models in-dicating intended setting of birth, including planned attended and planned unassisted home births in the U.S. and intended birth at-tendants are needed to better understand and assess outcomes by birth settings.'' The Committee urges the National Center for Health Statistics to explore ways to collect more detailed records on birth settings as part of its collection of vital statistics. Familial Hypercholesterolemia. \u2014The Committee includes $100,000 to support efforts focused on this inherited genetic dis-order that causes early, aggressive, heart disease. The Committee is concerned that more than 85 percent of those in the U.S. who VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) are completely unaware of their condition. The Committee supports CDC address-ing FH as a public health concern in order to improve diagnosis and care delivery and prevent heart disease. Forecasting. \u2014The Committee encourages CDC to identify a re- search institution capable of developing a Center of Excellence that can model public health response, preparation, and planning of a coronavirus outbreak, and has experience participating in or hosting an influenza forecasting center of excellence. The Com-mittee encourages CDC to work in collaboration with leading re-search institutions that provide national leadership in creating methodologies and technologies to produce safe, effective AI sys-tems that are fair, accountable, transparent, and protect individual privacy. Health Data Dashboard. \u2014In order to improve health outcomes of Medicaid beneficiaries and improve efficiency of Medicaid payment models, the Committee encourages CDC to establish a pilot pro-gram to facilitate the integration of population health and social and economic determinants of health into a health care data plat-form.Such a platform should be able to create performance indica-tors for State Medicaid programs. National Neurological Conditions Surveillance System. \u2014The Committee includes $5,000,000 within Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Informatics to continue efforts on the two initial conditions. Primary Immunodeficiencies. \u2014The Committee includes funding at the fiscal year 2020 level to continue the existing program of education and awareness related to primary immunodeficiencies. This program has proven effective in identifying undiagnosed pa-tients and linking them to centers of care. With NIH estimating that one to two percent of the U.S. population is affected by these disorders, a greater commitment is required to maximize the bene-fits of this effort. Public Health Data Modernization Initiative. \u2014The Coronavirus Pandemic and the outbreak of lung injury associated with the use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products brought to national attention that more needs to be done to ensure that CDC can develop and deploy world-class data and analytics that scale rapidly in emer-gencies, provide predictive capacity to identify emerging threats, reduce burden on public health partners who are reporting data and ensure bidirectional information flows. In addition, public health professionals are faced with rapid advances in data science and evolving cybersecurity threats that require the necessary skills to securely integrate health data. The Committee initiated the funding for this effort in fiscal year 2020 and provided significant, multi-year resources in the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136); the Com-mittee directs these funds to be thoughtfully planned and invested for a comprehensive, crosscutting effort to advance CDC's capabili-ties to respond to all public health threats not limited to COVID- 19. This is the opportunity for there to be significant improvement in public health data and analytics. The Committee includes $50,000,000 to continue to modernize systems, and recruit and re-tain skilled data scientists to improve public health data including at the National Center for Health Statistics, and State, local, tribal and territorial partners. Furthermore, the Committee encourages CDC to consider the acceleration of predictive modeling and use of VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, artificial intelligence to more rapidly transform how CDC collects and uses data to understand various situations in real time. Public Health Workforce. \u2014The bill includes an increase of $5,000,000 to support workforce and training programs, including the Epidemic Intelligence Service, that provide HHS, and State and local health departments with skilled staff, technical assistance, and education services. The Committee recognizes that a robust and well-trained public health workforce is critical to maintaining a highly-effective public health system. Strengthening Public Health Infrastructure. \u2014The Committee in- cludes an increase of $10,000,000 for CDC to assist States and eli-gible local public health agencies by strengthening basic epidemio-logic and laboratory capacity. ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $213,850,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 182,000,000 ............................................................. 236,850,000 Change from ......................................................... +23,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +54,850,000 The Committee recommendation includes $219,850,000 in discre- tionary appropriations and $17,000,000 in transfers from the PPH Fund. Programs supported within Environmental Health conduct sur- veillance and data collection to detect and address emerging patho-gens and environmental toxins that pose significant challenges to public health, as well as determine whether and at what level of exposure these substances are harmful to humans. Within the total, the Committee recommends the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2021 Committee Environmental Health Laboratory.. .............................................................................................. ................... $68,750,000 Newborn Screening Quality Assurance Program ................................................................................... 19,000,000 Newborn Screening /Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Diseases .................................................... Climate and Health ............................................................................................................. ........................... 15,000,000 Environmental Lead Exposure Registry ......................................................................................................... ......................... 10,000,000 Asthma. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $3,000,000 for the National Asthma Control Program. The Committee recognizes that millions of people in the U.S. suffer from asthma, and that it disproportionately affects African American children. Childhood Lead Poisoning. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $3,000,000 to strengthen blood lead surveillance by supporting state and local program to improve blood lead screening test rates, identify high-risk populations, and ensure effective follow-up for children with elevated blood lead levels. The Committee encourages CDC to require that States receiving funding for lead prevention report all blood tests in a standardized format through the Nation-ally Notifiable Noninfectious Diseases and Conditions reporting VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, system. The Committee directs the Lead Exposure and Prevention Advisory Committee to produce a report about the prevalence and impact of leaded paint manufacturing plants. The report should identify the leaded paint manufacturers, public health hazards posed by the plants (including but not limited to the environmental hazards), and how the leaded paint is being circulated. The report shall be included in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justifica-tion. Climate and Health. \u2014The Committee recognizes that commu- nities are on the front line of responding to climate-related health effects, including health threats from increased spread of vector- borne diseases, higher levels of air pollution, hotter temperatures, extreme weather events and longer allergy seasons. The Committee includes an increase of $5,000,000 to expand investments to a larg-er number of States, cities, or tribes to plan for public health threats caused by climate change, and to conduct an analysis of grantee programs to allow for broad sharing of best practices and strategies that best protect public health. Lead Exposure Registry. \u2014The Committee supports CDC's imple- mentation of the Flint, Michigan Lead Exposure Registry and di-rects $10,000,000 for the continuation of the Registry beyond fiscal year 2021. Newborn Screening. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $2,000,000 to further support newborn screening efforts so that af-fected newborns can receive early and often life-saving treatment through the timely implementation for all Recommended Uniform Screening Panel conditions. The Committee is aware that State laboratories need specialized support to begin screening for addi-tional newborn conditions and recognizes CDC's expertise in work-ing with laboratories to implement accurate newborn screening tests. The Committee supports the Newborn Screening Quality As-surance Program to support State laboratories as they implement screening for new disorders. This funding will support evaluation of testing methods for new conditions, expansion of CDC's quality assurance materials, and critical infrastructure and development of tests for rare conditions. INJURY PREVENTION AND CONTROL Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $677,379,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 730,159,000 ............................................................. 694,879,000 Change from ......................................................... +17,500,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a535,280,000 Programs supported within Injury Prevention and Control pro- vide national leadership on violence and injury prevention, conduct research and surveillance, and promote evidence-based strategies to inform real-world solutions to prevent premature death and dis-ability and to reduce human suffering and medical costs caused by injury and violence. The Committee does not accept the proposal to include $100,000,000 for the Drug-Free Communities program in the In-jury Prevention and Control appropriation. The Committee directs the program to remain in the Office of National Drug Control Pol-icy. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul the total, the Committee recommends the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2021 Committee Domestic Violence .......................................................................................... ............... Maltreatment ............................................................................................................................... 7,250,000 Youth ........................ 15,100,000 ............................. Adverse Childhood 4,000,000 National Violent Death Reporting Research Centers ................................................................................................ .................... Injury and Mortality Prevention Research ............................................................................... ......... 25,000,000 Adverse Childhood Experiences. \u2014The Committee encourages CDC to prioritize the collection and reporting of data on adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), including exposure to violence, ne-glect, and living in a home with mental health or substance use problems, and to use these data to support the implementation of comprehensive ACEs prevention strategies at the State, territorial, tribal and local levels. The Committee also encourages CDC to re-port on the prevalence of adverse childhood experiences across ge-ography, race and ethnicity, disability and socioeconomic status. Child Sexual Abuse Prevention .\u2014The Committee includes an in- crease of $1,000,000 and recognizes the severe and often life-long physical, cognitive and emotional impact of child sexual abuse and appreciates CDC's report outlining the gaps in current child sexual abuse prevention research. These opportunities include the need to improve surveillance systems and data collection, increase the un-derstanding of risk and protective factors, and develop and dissemi-nate effective prevention efforts. Domestic Violence and Sexual Violence. \u2014The Committee encour- ages CDC to prioritize the collection and reporting of data on do-mestic violence and sexual violence. The Committee also encour-ages CDC to work with State and local governments, as well as nonprofit organizations, to implement the necessary mechanism for sharing data as well as provide technical assistance when needed to ensure that the data is properly understood and utilized cor-rectly. Domestic Violence Prevention. \u2014The Committee includes an in- crease of $2,000,000 for the Domestic Violence Prevention En-hancements and Leadership Through Alliances (DELTA) program to expand efforts. DELTA is the only dedicated federal funding source for the primary prevention of domestic violence. Drowning Prevention. \u2014About one in five people who die from drowning are children aged 14 and younger. For every child who dies from drowning, another five receive emergency department care for nonfatal submersion injuries.The Committee strongly sup-ports efforts by CDC to educate families and youth serving organi-zations on the best practices to avoid injuries related to drowning, VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, and to support State drowning surveillance efforts and a national plan on water safety. Firearm Injury and Mortality Prevention Research. \u2014The Com- mittee includes an increase of $12,500,000 for research on firearm injury and mortality through a public health approach that focuses on data to understand its causes and to inform prevention strate-gies. The Committee directs CDC to focus on activities that will have the greatest potential public health impact. Furthermore, the Committee recognizes that community gun violence, such as gang violence, constitutes a significant portion of gun homicides in the U.S. There is a disproportionate impact of community gun violence on low-income communities of color, which is not often reflected in the national narrative surrounding gun violence. The Committee encourages CDC to support research on community gun violence and to select grantees that reflect the diversity of the victims of gun violence and that work in or near the impacted communities. National Violent Death Reporting System. \u2014The Committee in- cludes funding for the only State-based surveillance system that pools information together from multiple sources into a usable, anonymous database of all types of violent deaths so that preven-tion efforts can be informed and progress monitored. Opioid Abuse and Overdose Prevention. \u2014The Committee com- mends CDC for its leadership on combating opioid drug overdoses. The Committee encourages the Director to continue to implement these activities based on population-adjusted burden of disease cri-teria, including mortality data (age adjusted rate), as significant criteria when distributing funds for overdose prevention activities. The Committee recognizes that the substance misuse epidemic is shifting, with an increase in overdoses resulting from stimulants and other substances. The Committee urges for CDC to monitor, prevent, and reduce harms associated with drug use, misuse, and overdose, including opioids, stimulants, cannabis, and other emerg-ing risks. The Committee appreciates efforts by CDC to ensure that funding for opioid abuse and overdose prevention reaches local communities to advance local understanding of the opioid overdose epidemic and to scale-up prevention and response activities as in-tended by Congress. Public Health Approach to Violence. \u2014The Committee recognizes all forms of violence as a health crisis that is in desperate need of increased data collection and funding to support effective preven-tion and intervention efforts grounded in public health approaches. There is increasing evidence of the profound negative effects of vio-lence and the exposure to violence on child development, the long- term mental and physical health of affected populations, and the economic development of communities, especially communities of color. In order to support calls for greater investment in these ap-proaches, the Committee directs CDC within 180 days of enact-ment of this Act to submit a comprehensive report detailing the scope and intersection of all forms of violence in the U.S., the cost of violence, and identify areas where more data and intervention are needed. Rape Prevention. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $2,000,000 to amplify funding to States and Territories to support essential rape prevention and education programs. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, \u2014The Committee recognizes that suicide is devastating communities across the U.S., as evidenced by more than 48,000 deaths in 2018, and is the tenth leading cause of death in America. While depression and other mental health conditions are a signifi-cant risk factor for suicide, less than half of the people who die by suicide have a known mental health condition. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $342,800,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021.. ..................................................... 190,000,000 ............................................................. 344,700,000 Change from ......................................................... +1,900,000 Change from budget request .......................................................... +154,700,000 The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducts applied research, develops criteria for occupa-tional safety and health standards, and provides technical services to government, labor, and industry, including training for the pre-vention of work-related diseases and injuries. This appropriation supports surveillance, health hazard evaluations, intramural and extramural research, instrument and methods development, dis-semination, and training grants. Within the total for NIOSH, the Committee recommends the fol- lowing amounts: Budget Activity 2021 Committee National Occupational .......................................................................................... ............. $117,000,000 Agricultural, Forestry, and Fishing ........................................................................................................ 26,500,000 Education ................................................................................................. .................. Firefighter Cancer Registry .................................................................................................... and Health Research .................................................................................. ........ 113,100,000 Agricultural, Forestry, and Fishing. \u2014The Committee includes funding to support efforts to protect workers in this sector by pro-viding leadership in applied research, disease and injury surveil-lance, education and prevention. Education and Research Centers. \u2014The Committee includes fund- ing to support efforts to reduce work-related injuries and illnesses by prevention research, and implementing programs to improve oc-cupational health and safety. Mesothelioma. \u2014The Committee recognizes that CDC undertook a feasibility study for a mesothelioma patient registry in fiscal year 2019 to evaluate case finding methodologies to determine incidence and prevalence, demographics and risk factors.The Committee in-cludes an increase of $400,000 to take the next step toward estab-lishment ofa national mesothelioma patient registry through col-lecting data on individuals suffering from the disease and identify gaps in treatment in order for researchers to develop new treat-ments and a cure for this disease, which is among the deadliest and most painful cancers. The Committee encourages CDCto estab-lish priorities for successful outcomes; develop and revise standards of care and treatment best practices; share evidence-based informa-tion between physicians across the country; and implement bench-marks to improve care for mesothelioma patients. VerDate Sep 11 2014 05:16 Jul 08, Health. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $1,500,000 for the Total Worker Health (TWH) program, which supports centers of excellence that advance the overall safety, health, and well-being of U.S. workers. The Committee notes that millions of American workers and businesses are confronting the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic; these include iso-lation, economic insecurity, concerns about physical health and the challenges of working remotely and reintegrating back into the workplace. In addition, mental health conditions represent a lead-ing cause of worker disability, rising medical costs and lost produc-tivity. Therefore, the Committee directs NIOSH to use the addi-tional funding to create a new TWH center of excellence for work-place mental health. This center will support companies across all sizes and industries in the study and implementation of best prac-tices to improve workplace mental health and worker well-being nationwide. NIOSH should award the center to an academic re-search institution in partnership with a national nonprofit organi-zation. Priority should be given to applicants with expertise in mental illness from the worker/workplace perspective, a strong track record of data collection and analysis, experience in sus-taining a positive culture/climate in U.S. workplaces, and evalu-ating workplace policies and practices with employers of varying sizes. The center should also have the capacity to translate data and science into interventions, disseminate best practices across the country and collect national data on employers and the mental health and well-being of their workers. ENERGY EMPLOYEES OCCUPATIONAL ILLNESS COMPENSATION PROGRAM Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $55,358,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 55,358,000 Committee Recommendation ............................................................. 55,358,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... - - - Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Pro- gram (EEOICPA) provides compensation to employees and sur-vivors of employees of Department of Energy facilities and private contractors who have been diagnosed with a radiation-related can-cer, beryllium-related disease, or chronic silicosis as a result of their work. NIOSH estimates occupational radiation exposure for cancer cases, considers and issues determinations for adding class-es of workers to the Special Exposure Cohort, and provides admin-istrative support to the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health. GLOBAL HEALTH Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $570,843,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 532,222,000 ............................................................. 572,843,000 Change from ......................................................... +2,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +40,621,000 Through its Global Health activities, CDC coordinates, cooper- ates, participates with, and provides consultation to other nations, Federal agencies, and international organizations to prevent and contain diseases and environmental health problems and to develop and apply health promotion activities. In cooperation with min- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul health and other appropriate organizations, CDC tracks and assesses evolving global health issues and identifies and devel-ops activities to apply CDC's technical expertise. In addition, the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supple- mental Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-123) included $300,000,000 and the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $500,000,000 for glob-al disease detection and emergency response. Within the total, the Committee recommends the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2021 Committee Global Protection ................................................................................................ ..................... 183,200,000 Global Health Security .\u2014The Committee provided additional, multi-year funding through coronavirus supplemental appropria-tions to further CDC's work to protect global health security through the Center for Global Health, the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, and other programs that detect, prevent, and respond to infectious diseases and other health threats. CDC's global health security work focuses on the core foundation for strong public health systems: surveillance, lab-oratory, workforce, and emergency operations. As emerging infec- tious diseases like COVID-19, Ebola and Zika represent profound challenges for our health system, the Committee supports contin-ued work supporting the core public health system foundations for Ministries of Health and enhanced work in research and develop-ment aimed at creating new tools to respond to health threats at home and abroad. The Committee urges CDC to ensure that the importance of research and development to global health security is appropriately reflected in their international engagements. The Committee also supports CDC's core activities in developing and validating innovative tools for use by U.S. bilateral and multilat-eral global health programs and laboratory efforts to monitor and combat drug and insecticide resistance, a function essential to en-suring that global health programs are responsive, efficient, and tailored for maximum impact. The Committee notes the urgent need for new disease detection and diagnostic tools to accurately measure progress towards the U.S. government's disease control and elimination goals and supports CDC's leadership role in the development of those tools and in the application of next-generation approaches to disease sequencing and diagnosis. Global Public Health Protection .\u2014In addition to the funding pro- vided in this bill, the Committee provided significant, multi-year funding in the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) to support and enhance CDC's mission to protect the health of our nation, including by working across the globe. The Committee supports CDC's global ef-forts to detect epidemic threats earlier, respond more effectively, and prevent avoidable crises, including by providing support of pro-gram implementation and scientific and technical experts in At-lanta and in the field with concentrated efforts on countries, popu- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul and programs where resources will have the greatest public health impact. Global Tuberculosis .\u2014The Committee includes an increase of $2,000,000 to advance CDC's global tuberculosis priorities to find, cure, prevent, and sustain. Global Water Strategy .\u2014The Committee recognizes CDC's work to provide sustainable Water, Sanitation, & Hygiene (WASH) in healthcare facilities, aligned with the 2017 US Global Water Strat-egy, and to support WASH efforts to contribute to the elimination of cholera as a public health threat as outlined by Ending Chol-era\u2014A Global Roadmap to 2030. The Committee urges CDC to in-crease its WASH efforts in areas where Neglected Tropical Dis-eases are endemic. Malaria .\u2014The Committee is concerned with the exponentially growing need of severe malaria treatment with no commercially available options following the withdrawal of the only FDA-ap-proved drug for severe malaria (quinidine) from the U.S. market. The severe malaria treatment preferred by the World Health Orga-nization is IV artesunate which is not FDA-approved due to a lack of commercial interest. CDC is able to stock its network of Quar-antine Stations with IV artesunate by relying on imports from China as well as unused reserves from the Department of Defense. Artesunate releases from CDC's Quarantine Stations have in-creased almost 1,100 percent from 2018 to 2019. To address the need for rapid access, CDC is encouraged to support additional staff support at Quarantine Stations and headquarters to provide technical support, coupled with an expanded distribution model. Distributing artesunate from Quarantine Stations, select health de-partments, and positioning at select hospitals is the most effective and cost-efficient method for preventing morbidity in high burden areas. This hybrid model would put artesunate within 100 miles of 88 percent of the places that severe cases have historically reported to. Additional work to promote utilization of malaria prophylaxis for travelers could help reduce malaria cases. Parasitic Disease and Malaria .\u2014The Committee recognizes the important role the Center plays in the fight against malaria and parasitic disease, and protecting Americans through global health security through its efforts to detect, prevent, and respond to infec-tious diseases and other health threats. The Center also provides crucial monitoring and surveillance of transmission, evaluation of interventions for effectiveness and impact, development of key diagnostics, and testing of tools in a real work setting that are crit-ical to ensuring that our global health investments are smarter, better, and not wasteful. Therefore, the Committee encourages CDC to continue to research, monitor, and evaluate efforts for ma-laria and parasitic disease in collaboration with other divisions and agencies. Population-based Surveillance Platforms .\u2014The Committee di- rects at least $3,000,000 to be used to support existing longitudinal population-based infectious disease surveillance platforms that en-able comparative analysis between urban and rural populations in the developing world. Soil Transmitted Helminth and Related Diseases of Poverty .\u2014The Committee includes $1,500,000 to extend the currently funded CDC VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, projects aimed at surveillance, source remediation and clinical care to reduce soil transmitted helminth infection. World Health Organization .\u2014The Committee strongly opposes the President's proposed ban on U.S. support and funding for the World Health Organization (WHO). This action would have a dam-aging impact on global public health efforts affecting billions of people across the globe, including the current response to the COVID-19 pandemic, global health security, emergency prepared-ness and response, and programs to reduce chronic disease. For ex-ample, a ban on support for the WHO would have a terrible impact on the global polio eradication campaign, in which WHO-coordi-nated surveillance is critical to tracking polio outbreaks, targeting resources to those outbreaks, and ultimately, certifying regions to be polio free. The Committee urges CDC to continue to engage with the WHO to address global health issues, including COVID-19, and to continue to use its resources to support essential WHO global health activities. PUBLIC HEALTH PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $827,200,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 802,000,000 ............................................................. 852,200,000 Change from ......................................................... +25,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +50,200,000 The Public Health Preparedness and Response (PHPR) account supports programs that build and strengthen national prepared-ness for public health emergencies, both naturally-occurring and in-tentional. PHPR supports needs assessments, response planning, training, epidemiology and surveillance, and upgrades for labora-tory capacity and communications systems. In addition, the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supple- mental Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-123) included $950,000,000; the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $1,500,000,000 for State, local, Tribal, and Territorial health departments. Moreover, the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (P.L. 116-139) included $10,250,000,000 for diagnostic testing of COVID-19 that was distributed to State, local, and Territorial re-cipients through the public health emergency preparedness cooper-ative agreement. Within the total, the Committee recommends the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2021 Committee Public Health Emergency Preparedness Cooperative Agreement .................................................................. $70 0,000,000 Academic Centers for Public Health Preparedness CDC Preparedness and Response and COVID-19 .\u2014The Committee rec- ognizes the risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to our nation's essential farm workforce as they continue to ensure the availability of the food supply. The Committee urges the CDC to provide tech-nical assistance to State and local health departments to ensure that farmworkers are included in any category of the workforce that receives priority for COVID-19 diagnostic testing. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, Preparedness Cooperative Agreements .\u2014The Com- mittee includes an increase of $25,000,000 to enhance support to State and local health departments in developing and maintaining capable, flexible, and adaptable public health systems to rapidly re-spond in an emergency. The Committee encourages CDC to apply a risk-based approach using population or other risks when allo-cating funds to PHEP in order to reflect the potential magnitude of illness and death that may be anticipated. The Committee recog-nizes the challenges of ensuring adequate response in remote geo-graphical areas, such as the Pacific territories, during potential outbreaks and encourages CDC improve laboratory capacity in such areas. Furthermore, the Committee directs the incorporation of Limited English Proficient (LEP) Individuals in emergency plan-ning. The Committee requests a report on the steps taken to en-sure that recipients are conducting outreach to LEP communities in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justification. Strategic National Stockpile .\u2014The Committee recognizes the re- organization of the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. The Committee expects that CDC will continue its significant role in providing scientific expertise in decision-making related to procure-ment of countermeasures, and maintaining strong relationships with State and local public health departments to facilitate effi-cient deployment of countermeasures in public health emergencies. BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $25,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 30,000,000 ............................................................. 30,000,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +5,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - The Committee recommendation includes $30,000,000, an in- crease of $5,000,000, in discretionary budget authority.

This account supports public health leadership and support ac- tivities at CDC. Within the total, the Committee recommends the following amounts: VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul FY 2021 Committee Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant .............................................................................. ....... $160,000,000 Public Health Leadership and Support ........................................................................................... ............... Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund ................................................................................ ...... 85,000,000 Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund .\u2014The Com- mittee includes funding within this account for the Infectious Dis-eases Rapid Response Reserve Fund. This funding is in addition to the resources provided in the Coronavirus Preparedness and Re-sponse Supplemental Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-123) and the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136). As utilized during the initial response to COVID-19, the Reserve Fund will provide an immediate source of funding to quickly respond to an imminent infectious disease cri-sis that endangers American lives. Funds are available until ex-pended. Management-Worker Relations .\u2014The Committee urges CDC to continue a robust program to support the morale and engagement of staff, including addressing management-worker relations and en-suring fair, equitable treatment that complies with Federal civil rights statutes and standards. Prevention and Public Health Fund .\u2014The Committee encourages the Prevention and Public Health fund be used for programs it was intended to assist, such as cardiovascular/stroke prevention through Million Hearts. Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant .\u2014The Com- mittee continues to support the Preventive Health and Health Services Block grant, of which at least $7,000,000 is to support di-rect services to victims of sexual assault and to prevent rape. Undergraduate Public Health Scholars Program .\u2014The Com- mittee encourages CDC to continue engagement of Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the CDC Undergraduate Public Health Scholars (CUPS) Program. N ATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $41,684,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 38,371,491,000 ............................................................. 46,959,000,000 Change from ......................................................... +5,275,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +8,587,509,000 The Committee recommendation for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) program level includes $40,617,687,000 in discre-tionary appropriations and $1,341,313,000 in Public Health Service Act section 241 evaluation set-aside transfers. Within the total ap-propriation, the Committee recommendation includes $404,000,000 in budget authority authorized in the 21stCentury Cures Act (P.L. 114-255). The bill includes an increase in discretionary, non-emer-gency budget authority of 588,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level, which is necessary to maintain an overall increase of $500,000,000 while compensating for a reduction of $88,000,000 in funding made available by the Cures Act. In addition, Title VI of this Act includes $5,000,000,000 in emer- gency appropriations to NIH, of which not less than $2,500,000,000 must be transferred to Institutes and Centers in proportion to their share of appropriations in fiscal year 2020. Each Institute and Cen-ter will receive an increase of at least 7 percent over the 2020 en- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, acted level. The emergency appropriation is further described under Title VI. Further, the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supple- mental Appropriations Act included $826,000,000; the CARES Act included $945,400,000; and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act included $1,806,000,000 for NIH to support and conduct research on diagnostics, therapeutics, and vac-cines for COVID-19. The mission of NIH is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. NIH conducts and supports research to understand the basic biology of human health and disease; apply this under-standing towards designing new approaches for preventing, diag-nosing, and treating disease and disability; and ensure that these approaches are widely available. The recommendation includes funding for initiatives established in the 21st Century Cures Act, including a total of $195,000,000 for the Cancer Moonshot Initiative; $500,000,000 for the ''All of Us'' precision medicine initiative (including $109,000,000 from the Cures Act); and $500,000,000 for the Brain Research through Ap-plication of Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative (in-cluding $100,000,000 from the Cures Act). The Committee includes specific funding allocations for a number of initiatives and activities detailed in the Institute- and Center- specific sections below. NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE (NCI) Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $6,440,442,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 5,881,173,000 ............................................................. 6,494,155,000 Change from ......................................................... +53,713,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +612,982,000 Committee Recommendation (including Title VI) ........................... 6,908,600,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +468,158,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +1,027,427,000 In addition, the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act included $306,000,000 for NCI to support re-search related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mission .\u2014NCI leads, conducts, and supports cancer research across the nation to advance scientific knowledge and help all peo-ple live longer, healthier lives. Cancer Bioengineering .\u2014The Committee is concerned about the high cost of new cancer therapies. A major driver for the high cost is that 95 percent of cancer therapies that begin Phase I clinical trials fail to secure FDA approval. The Committee is encouraged by the scientific advances in cancer research generated by the Phys-ical Sciences Oncology Network (PSON) and the Cancer Systems Biology Consortium (CSBC) where math, physics, and bio-engineering approaches have revealed novel strategies that may re-duce the clinical trial failure rate and lower the cost of new cancer therapies. The Committee encourages NCI to build upon the suc-cess of the PSON and CSBC by funding research focused on bio-engineering and quantitative approaches to basic science and translational oncology. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Clinical Trials .\u2014The Committee is concerned that only a small percent of patients participate in cancer clinical trials, even though most express an interest in clinical research; and that ulti-mately, about one in five cancer clinical trials fail because of lack of patient enrollment. Groups that are generally underrepresented in clinical trials include racial and ethnic minorities and older and lower-income individuals as well as those from rural communities. As such, the Committee directs the GAO to conduct a review of what actions Federal agencies have taken to help to address bar-riers to participate in Federally-funded cancer clinical trials by populations that have been traditionally underrepresented in such trials, and identify challenges, if any, in implementing such ac-tions. In addition, this GAO review should identify additional ac-tions that can be taken by Federal agencies to address barriers to participation in Federally-funded cancer clinical trials by popu-lations that have been traditionally underrepresented in such trials and make recommendations on potential changes in practices and policies to improve participation in such trials by such populations. Cancer Immunotherapy .\u2014The Committee recognizes that cancer immunotherapies hold enormous promise to cure a number of can-cers. Patients with certain hematologic malignancies have already benefited from the development of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T), an immunotherapy. Additional innovative and life-saving therapies for different types of cancers, some with few treatment options, will only be available from additional research in this field. The Committee is encouraged by the research NCI has already supported in this field, but urges the Institute to continue to prioritize research on new immunotherapies. The Committee re-quests that NCI provide an update in the fiscal year 2022 Congres-sional Justification on progress being made in this area and the gaps in research that remain. Cancer Moonshot .\u2014The Committee directs NIH to transfer $195,000,000 from the NIH Innovation Account to NCI to support the Cancer Moonshot initiative. These funds were authorized in the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255). Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) .\u2014The Committee in- cludes $50,000,000 for the second year of the CCDI, as proposed in the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The development of new thera-pies is important to finding a cure for childhood cancers, many of which have not seen new therapies in decades. Childhood Cancer Survival Metrics .\u2014A recent study determined that childhood cancer diagnoses are on the rise by approximately 0.8 percent per year. Worldwide, there are 400,000 new childhood cancer diagnoses annually. However, childhood cancer death rates are described as being on the decline. The Committee is concerned that the current metric used to determine mortality and survival statistics for childhood cancer does not fully capture the long-term morbidity and mortality of these diseases. Currently, a child or adult that lives five years from the date of diagnosis is considered a survivor. Yet, children are not small adults and their potential life span after diagnosis is much longer than an adult. Using the five-year survival metric does not capture children who die pre-maturely as a result of their cancer or its treatment when they are past the five-year point. The Committee directs NCI to establish a task force composed of childhood cancer researchers and advocates VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, the most appropriate survivorship metric for child- hood cancer. In addition, the Committee recognizes a critical goal of the CCDI is to collect comprehensive data about every child di-agnosed with cancer in the U.S., including data on survival and mortality, such as death due to late effects of cancer and its treat-ment. The Committee requests an update from NCI in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justification focusing on how CCDI efforts will address this need to more accurately capture childhood cancer mortality beyond the current five-year survival metric. Deadliest Cancers .\u2014The Committee looks forward to seeing NCI's update on developing scientific frameworks for stomach and esophageal cancers as well as ways in which it is supporting re-search into all recalcitrant cancers, as directed in House Report 116-62. Further, the Committee notes that the Recalcitrant Cancer Research Act of 2012 directed NCI to develop a scientific frame-work for at least two cancer types that meet the definition of recal-citrant cancers as defined in the Act. The Committee directs NCI to outline other specific steps the NCI is taking to support research that aims to reduce the burden of disease from pancreatic, non- small cell lung, stomach, and esophageal cancers in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justification. Endometrial Cancer .\u2014The Committee is concerned that both the incidence and mortality rates for endometrial cancer are rising, with a survival disparity for Black women. The Committee believes that a renewed emphasis by NCI on endometrial cancer research is needed to facilitate early detection and optimal treatments and outcomes for all women, including minority populations. The Com-mittee urges NCI to study endometrial cancer disparities, including biologic differences in tumor type, molecular mechanisms, patho-genesis, and tumor microenvironment, and to conduct clinical trials to better define appropriate therapy for a precision medicine ap-proach to endometrial cancer. The Committee requests an update on NCI's activities regarding endometrial cancer in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justification, including progress made in inci-dence and survival rates by ethnicity. Glioblastoma (GBM) .\u2014The Committee recognizes that GBM is the most common, most deadly, and most difficult form of brain cancer to treat in adults. For the thousands of Americans facing this disease, the lack of progress is a devastating reality that trails behind the impressive progress made in research of other forms of cancer. The Committee strongly encourages NIH to support addi-tional research on glioblastoma treatment. HPV Associated Cancers .\u2014The Committee encourages NCI to ex- pand research related to HPV-associated cancers. Kidney Cancer .\u2014The Committee is concerned with the growing number of kidney cancer diagnoses and lack of early detection of the disease. The Committee encourages NCI to continue to prioritize meritorious research that could assist in developing diag-nostic tests and early detection techniques. Liver Cancer .\u2014The Committee notes that liver cancer is a dev- astating disease, with a five-year survival rate of only 20 percent. The Committee commends NCI for the creation of a Specialized Center of Research Excellence (SPORE) focused on liver cancer and encourages other new program projects, research, and contract op-portunities for investigators that focus on a better understanding VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, of the biology of liver cancer and new therapeutic targets. In addi- tion, the Committee commends NCI for its support of the inter-in-stitute effort to develop the NIH Strategic Plan to Cure Hepatitis B and encourages continued close collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the Na-tional Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and active participation in the Director's Trans-NIH Hep-atitis B Working Group. The Committee requests an update on NCI's activities in these areas in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justification. Melanoma .\u2014The Committee encourages NCI to continue its sup- port of research on melanoma, including the development of experi-mental models to identify mechanisms and associated biomarkers, new technologies such as artificial intelligence systems for detec-tion and classification, and clinical trials that provide population- based evidence for public health guidelines for screening and sun protection practices. In addition, the Committee encourages re-search on therapies for metastatic in trials designed to test for clinical benefit; and risk factors for recurrence. The Committee also urges NCI to continue to evalu-ate clinical trial eligibility criteria so that patients with brain me-tastases can also be included in trials whenever clinically appro-priate and urges inclusion of melanoma in enhancements to the SEER registry. Finally, in the U.S., there are now more than 1.3 million survivors of melanoma. The Committee encourages further research into survivorship care for melanoma patients. The Com-mittee requests an update on these requests in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justification. Pancreatic Cancer .\u2014The Committee appreciates NCI's recent submissions of the five-year review and update reports required by the Recalcitrant Cancer Research Act of 2012. This year, the Com-mittee looks forward to the report on the effectiveness of the frame-work, including an update on research efforts in pancreatic cancer prevention, detection, diagnosis, and treatment. While progress has been made, the Committee encourages NCI to continue to support research efforts to advance discoveries and improve treatment op-tions for patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Partnerships to Advance Cancer Health Equity (PACHE) Pro- gram .\u2014The Committee encourages NCI to expand support for the PACHE program, which aims to create stable, comprehensive, and long-term partnerships between institutions serving underserved health disparity populations and underrepresented students (ISUPS) and NCI-designated Cancer Centers (CCs) in the areas of cancer research, cancer research education, and cancer outreach. The Committee encourages NCI to prioritize funding to States and territories in the Pacific Region, where, according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, sociocultural, geographic, and biologic factors contribute to cancer health disparities in indig-enous Pacific peoples (IPPs) in Guam, Hawaii, and the U.S. Associ-ated Pacific Islands (USAPI), and IPPs experience a greater burden of cancer health disparities that are associated with late-stage di-agnosis and poor survival outcomes compared with majority popu-lations in the U.S. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul Brain Cancer .\u2014The Committee recognizes that brain cancer remains the most fatal of all pediatric cancers. Despite progress in other diseases, pediatric brain cancer survival rates have not improved for decades and have lagged behind the strides made in other cancers. The majority of children who survive may experience lifelong impairments and disabilities that result from high levels of toxicity associated with treatment. The committee strongly encourages NIH to expand funding on research on pedi-atric brain cancer, including but not limited to drug delivery meth-ods and new therapies with reduced levels of toxicity and long-term complications. Prostate Cancer .\u2014The Committee remains concerned that pros- tate cancer lacks treatments for men with advanced disease as well as adequate diagnostic and imaging methodologies. To ensure Fed-eral resources are leveraged to the greatest extent possible, the Committee encourages NCI to coordinate, when appropriate, its re-search efforts with other Federal agencies, including the Depart-ment of Defense, as well as private research foundations and advo-cacy groups. Rare Cancers Therapeutics Research and Development .\u2014 Rare cancers, defined at those cancers that have fewer than six new cases per 100,000 Americans per year, represent over 30 percent of all cancers. Rare cancers present a unique research challenges for many reasons, including the difficulty in accruing enough patients to participate in clinical trials, the lack of industry focus on these cancers due to the relatively small number of patients diagnosed with each cancer, the lack of rare cancer tumor models and cell lines, and the difficulty of patients receiving accurate and precise diagnoses due in part to the lack of clinician familiarity with rare cancers. The Committee commends NCI's investment in the Rare Tumor Patient Engagement Networks, including NCI CONNECT and MyPART, and in particular the NCI Experimental Thera-peutics Program, with a focus on supporting the most promising new drug discovery and development projects. The Committee en-courages NCI to expand these initiatives to include additional rare cancers not covered in prior and existing efforts and to issue a re-port on this progress and an update on the DART study in the fis-cal year 2022 Congressional Justification. Reducing Native American Cancer Disparities .\u2014The Committee encourages NCI to expand research efforts to reduce Native Amer-ican cancer disparities, including through NCI's continued partici-pation in the trans-NIH Intervention Research to Improve Native American Health (IRINAH) program. The Committee notes that the Native American population experiences an overall cancer inci-dence and mortality rates which are much higher than non-Native populations. The goal of intensifying research in this area is to de-velop durable capacity for tribally-engaged cancer disparities re-search through an integrated program of research, education, out-reach, and clinical access. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program Registry .\u2014 The SEER Program is an authoritative source of infor- mation on cancer incidence and survival in the U.S. SEER cur-rently collects and publishes cancer incidence and survival data from population-based cancer registries covering approximately 34.6 percent of the U.S. population. The Committee encourages VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, NCI to continue to advance efforts to modernize the SEER Registry and better capture key data points, such as metastatic recurrence and cancer migration. The Committee requests an update on plans to cover more of the U.S. population in the fiscal year 2022 Con-gressional Justification. Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPOREs) .\u2014The SPORE program is a key component of NCI's efforts to translate basic research into the prevention, early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. The Committee commends NCI for its recent funding opportunity announcement regarding the development of SPOREs that are focused on cancer health disparities, and it en-courages additional research in this area. The Committee urges NCI to prioritize the use of multi-center SPOREs, which allow greater opportunities for collaborative, interdisciplinary research. STAR Act .\u2014The Committee includes no less than $25,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level, for continued imple-mentation of sections of the Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treat-ment, Access, and Research (STAR) Act to expand existing bio-repositories for childhood cancer patients enrolled in NCI-spon-sored clinical trials to collect and maintain relevant clinical, bio-logical, and demographic information on children, adolescents, and young adults, with an emphasis on selected cancer subtypes (and their recurrences) for which current treatments are least effective. Funding provided this year will allow NCI to continue to conduct and support childhood cancer survivorship research as authorized in the STAR Act. Women and Lung Cancer .\u2014The Committee notes that lung can- cer has a disparate impact on women, particularly younger women who have never smoked. Additional research strategies are needed to explore the differences in women with respect to lung cancer risk factors, incidence, and histology. The Committee urges NCI to ac-celerate research into treatments and implementation of lung can-cer preventive services for women. The Committee requests an up-date on these activities in fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justifica-tion. NATIONAL HEART , LUNG , AND BLOOD INSTITUTE (NHLBI) Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $3,624,258,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 3,298,004,000 ............................................................. 3,655,428,000 Change from ......................................................... +31,170,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +357,424,000 Committee Recommendation (including Title VI) ........................... 3,888,652,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +264,394,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +590,648,000 In addition, the CARES Act included $103,400,000 for NHLBI to support and conduct research related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mission .\u2014NHLBI provides global leadership for a research, training, and education program to promote the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, and blood disorders and enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more ful-filling lives. Blood Donor Questionnaire Education Materials .\u2014The Com- mittee is concerned that certain FDA guidance in the educational materials provided in the blood donor questionnaire is inappro-priate and misguided. The recommendations for deferral should not VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul someone's sexual orientation, and rather should focus on risk factors that might expose a potential donor to blood-borne ill-ness. The Committee strongly recommends that NHLBI work with the FDA and remove or replace the recommended deferment of blood for men who have had sex with men in the last 12 months. Cardiovascular Disease .\u2014The Committee remains concerned about the prevalence of cardiovascular disease among Americans and encourages ongoing support for basic research programs to evaluate the damaging effects of smoking. Such research could help mitigate the risk of heart attack and stroke related to smoking and should also include better infrastructure to gather data on dam-aged endothelial cells in order to identify abnormalities caused by smoking, biomarkers of early disease, and personalized therapies to promote blood vessel healing. The Committee encourages NIH to support research to be conducted across the disciplines of medicine, immunology, imaging, chemistry, biomedical engineering, physics, statistics, mathematics, and entrepreneurship to design new thera-pies and therapy delivery systems and strategies that are safer and more effective and improve patient compliance, while seeking to move technologies from bench to bedside with private partners and local health care and community organizations. Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) .\u2014The Committee recognizes the value that well-characterized, longitudinal, population-based cohort studies provide in bringing to light more information about cardiovascular disease progression in FH. By studying participants over time, much can be learned about the development of cardio-vascular disease that will help scientists understand the role of en-vironmental and genetic factors in disease development and pro-gression. The Committee urges NHLBI to fund efforts to continue the study into the development and progression of cardiovascular disease caused by FH, the effect of treatment on patient outcomes, and effective ways to identify individuals with FH and their af-fected family members early in life. G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) .\u2014The Committee recog- nizes that recent developments in multiple basic sciences (struc-tural biology, molecular modeling, receptor biology, and pharma-cology) have greatly accelerated the rate of discovery of drugs that GPCRs, the largest and most readily and frequently targeted pro-tein family in the human genome. The rate of discovery now strains the ability of academic laboratories to test, in a timely man-ner, the efficacy of these drugs in physiologically and disease-rel-evant systems. Cardiovascular, lung, and blood diseases remain among the most important and costly diseases that would benefit from a new generation of drugs. The Committee encourages NHLBI to develop additional funding mechanisms enabling academic lab-oratories, as both singular and networked or collaborative entities, to accelerate the pace of pre-clinical development of GPCR-tar-geting drugs. Heart Disease .\u2014Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in the U.S., claiming hundreds of thousands of lives and costing billions of dollars every year. The Committee is concerned that this largely preventable disease disproportionately affects ra-cial and ethnic minorities and those living in rural communities and supports ongoing population studies that seek to address these disparities. The Committee is concerned that heart disease is the VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, leading cause of death of pregnant women and that one in five American women experience some type of cardiovascular complica-tion during pregnancy. The Committee supports the NHLBI's Stra-tegic Vision Objective to address maternal health and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease for women before, during, and after pregnancy. The Committee also supports continued research ad-dressing congenital heart disease, the acceleration of research in regenerative medicine, further investments in data science that will help facilitate precision medicine, and continued genetic re-search related to heart disease, including heart failure and atrial fibrillation (AFib). The Committee also commends the Institute for initiating research that seeks to address the health-related effects of e-cigarette use and vaping. Lymphedema (LE) .\u2014LE is a chronic, debilitating, and incurable swelling that can be a result of damage to the lymphatic system due to surgery, cancer treatment, or injury, and that can also be inherited. An estimated 10 million Americans suffer from lymphedema. Additional research is necessary to improve our un-derstanding of this condition and expand the treatment options available. The Committee strongly encourages NHLBI to expand support for research on LE and requests a report within 120 days of enactment of this Act describing NHLBI's current and planned research related to LE. National Center on Sleep Disorders Research (NCSDR) .\u2014The Committee commends the ongoing work of NCSDR to reinvigorate sleep, circadian, and sleep disorders research activities across the government, and notes impactful new projects through the HEAL Initiative and studying the relationship between sleep and stroke. The Committee encourages NCSDR to continue to build meaningful partnerships across Federal agencies and further coordinate re-search in this area. National Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Action Plan .\u2014The Committee notes NHLBI's role in crafting the National COPD Action Plan and encourages NHLBI to continue this impor-tant work by supporting additional research activities and collabo-rating with other Public Health Service agencies to facilitate imple-mentation of the plan's recommendations. Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) .\u2014The Com- mittee is disappointed in NIH's disregard for Congressional direc-tion in the recent NIH report Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS): State of the Science, Clinical Care, and Re-search , which was requested in Senate Report 115-289 and sub- mitted to the Committee on January 31, 2020. NIH appears to have ignored the symposium participants' recommendations and failed to provide the requested estimate of the level of funding needed annually to achieve the objectives specified in Senate Re-port 115-289. The Committee directs NIH to: (1) update the Janu-ary 31, 2020 report with recommendations from the POTS experts and submit a revised report to the Committee within 30 days of en-actment of this Act, (2) implement the research priorities described in the January 31, 2020 report supplemented with recommenda-tions from the POTS experts, including a funding estimate, and (3) provide a progress update to the Committee within 90 days of en-actment of this Act documenting progress towards identifying pri-ority areas of focus for future POTS research. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, Committee recognizes that PF is a family of more than 200 different lung diseases that all look very much alike despite having a variety of causes. This heterogeneity presents significant challenges for diagnosis and treatment. The Committee commends NHLBI for its recent efforts to apply the principles of precision medicine to PF research, especially by fund-ing a major new study that will evaluate a promising treatment for a subset of patients with a particular gene variant. This study, known as PRECISIONS, also aims to identify genetic variants that play a role in certain forms of PF. The Committee urges NHLBI to prioritize basic research on PF, particularly to better understand the causes and process of scarring and the varying impacts on pa-tients. Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) .\u2014The Committee commends NIH for its ongoing support of clinical research for SCD, which imposes major morbidity on an estimated 90,000 to 100,000 individuals in the U.S., with three million Americans carrying the sickle cell trait. The Committee encourages NIH to support clinical trials for pre-natal and postnatal treatment of SCD, which includes multiple promising approaches to eradicate this disease, save lives, and dra-matically reduce the substantial health care costs associated with SCD for children and adults. The Committee encourages NIH to consider programs both domestically and globally to evaluate the effectiveness of screening technologies for infants and children with the sickle cell trait and disease. Further, while the Committee is aware that NHLBI is funding very promising areas of innovation related to curative gene therapies, the Committee strongly encour-ages NHLBI to increase its focus as well on disease-modifying therapies that could improve day-to-day care for the vast majority of patients and address issues such as organ damage and pain management. Lastly, the Committee encourages NHLBI to fund the training of more sickle cell disease clinicians and researchers in order to maintain this essential workforce pipeline and to make advances on the transition from childhood medical care to adult. Thalassemia. \u2014Recent studies have shown that the length of time between when blood is donated and transfused does not impact out-comes for patients in need of an emergency blood transfusion. How-ever, these studies do not determine the impact on chronically- transfused patients, such as those with thalassemia, in which an administration of older red cells may exacerbate iron loading and contribute to worse outcomes. The Committee urges NHLBI to re-view the scientific literature on this issue and provide an update in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justification on the best way to address this public health issue. The Heart Truth Program. \u2014For over a decade, The Heart Truth program has worked to raise awareness about women's risk of heart disease. The program's goals are to increase awareness that heart disease is the leading cause of death among women and to increase the conversations between women and their healthcare providers. The Committee encourages NHLBI to continue robust support for The Heart Truth program. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, OF DENTAL AND CRANIOFACIAL RESEARCH (NIDCR) Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $477,429,000 Budget fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 434,559,000 ............................................................. 481,535,000 Change from ......................................................... +4,106,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +46,976,000 Committee Recommendation (including Title VI) ........................... 512,258,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +34,829,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +77,699,000 Mission. \u2014The mission of NIDCR is to improve dental, oral, and craniofacial health through research, research training, and the dissemination of health information. Oral Microbiome. \u2014The Committee appreciates NIDCR's leader- ship in microbiome research, including its support of the Human Oral Microbiome Database. The Committee encourages NIDCR to build upon its microbiome research to discover and better under-stand the microbiome's connection to overall health, including its influence on preventing and treating illness and disease. Regenerative Medicine. \u2014The Committee appreciates NIDCR's contributions to the field of regenerative medicine and recognizes the promise this field holds for people across the country, including but not limited to members of the military. The Committee urges NIDCR to continue supporting its already robust regenerative med-icine research portfolio and dedicate resources into promising re-search in this space, including autotherapies research. Surgeon General's Report on Oral Health. \u2014The Committee great- ly appreciates NIDCR's contributions to the U.S. Surgeon General's 2020 Report on Oral Health. The Committee encourages NIDCR to utilize the findings of the 2020 Report to identify research gaps across dental, oral, and craniofacial research and pursue research opportunities to fill those gaps. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES (NIDDK) Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $2,114,314,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 1,924,211,000 ............................................................. 2,132,498,000 Change from ......................................................... +18,184,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +208,287,000 Committee Recommendation (including Title VI) ........................... 2,268,556,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +154,242,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +344,345,000 Mission. \u2014The NIDDK mission is to conduct and support medical research and research training and disseminate science-based in-formation on diabetes and other endocrine and metabolic diseases; digestive diseases, nutritional disorders, and obesity; and kidney, urologic, and hematologic diseases, to improve people's health and quality of life. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). \u2014The Committee notes the work in supporting critical kidney research that NIDDK has ac-complished, including research on ESRD. This research has led to new developments for possible treatments and the Committee con-tinues to encourage NIDDK to work with stakeholders to facilitate new opportunities for research. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, \u2014The Committee encour- ages NIH to continue to invest in research on functional gastro-intestinal disorders, including to expand, intensify, and coordinate the activities of NIH with respect to functional gastrointestinal and motility disorders in line with the recommendations of the National Commission on Digestive Diseases relating to functional gastro-intestinal and motility disorders (FGIMDs). Further, the Com-mittee urges NIH to enhance innovative basic, translational, and clinical research focused on FGIMDs. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD). \u2014The Committee recog- nizes that GERD is the most common gastrointestinal (GI) diag-nosis and can lead to a variety of other GI diseases. The Committee is concerned about risks associated with pharmacological treat-ments of GERD while surgical approaches remain too invasive to most patients. The Committee directs NIDDK to submit a report to the Committee within 120 days of enactment of this Act on the current research done on non-pharmacological, non-surgical treat-ments for GERD, such as injectable bulking agents. The Committee encourages NIDDK to prioritize the bulking agents that were FDA- approved for non-GI indications and show promise in the treatment of GERD. Glomerular Diseases. \u2014The Committee continues to support the important work that the Cure Glomeruloneuropathy (CureGN) ini-tiative has accomplished that has led to breakthroughs for critical clinical trials. The Committee encourages NIDDK to continue sup-porting research that has proven to lead to new therapies. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD). \u2014The Committee recognizes NIDDK's leadership in supporting research into Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The Committee also recognizes the impor-tance of patient-centered, bedside-to-bench approaches to under-stand complex, chronic diseases such as IBD, and the need to bet-ter understand the impact of diet on IBD. The Committee directs NIDDK to pursue research on the interactions among food, the gut, and the brain/nervous system in people with IBD and other chronic gastrointestinal diseases. The Committee notes that this bedside- to-bench approach has been successful in other disease areas, in-cluding type 2 diabetes and oncology, and we encourage NIDDK to use a similar approach focused on IBD. Pediatric Nephrology. \u2014The Committee recognizes the importance of research funded by NIDDK to develop the infrastructure re-quired to enhance biomedical research focused on advancing inno-vations in kidney care, including research on pediatric kidney in-jury and disease. The Committee has raised concerns about the lack of clinical trials in pediatric nephrology. One way to address this problem is to ensure there is a robust training pipeline for the pediatric nephrology biomedical research workforce. The Com-mittee encourages NIDDK to prioritize mechanisms to incentivize researchers to enter this field. The Committee requests that NIDDK report back in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justifica-tion on the progress made to bolster this biomedical workforce, in-cluding opportunities so that young investigators may be further encouraged to explore research in this space. Polycystic Kidney Disease. \u2014The Committee commends NIDDK for its continued commitment to Polycystic Kidney Disease Re-search and Translation Centers and the Pediatric Centers of Excel- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul which improve our understanding of the causes of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease. The Committee con-tinues to encourage NIDDK to work with stakeholders to facilitate new opportunities for research and promote the development of new therapeutic strategies. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE (NINDS) Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $2,444,687,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 2,245,110,000 ............................................................. 2,465,110,000 Change from ......................................................... +40,423,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +220,000,000 Committee Recommendation (including Title VI) ........................... 2,622,427,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +177,740,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +377,317,000 Mission. \u2014The NINDS mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and use that knowledge to re-duce the burden of neurological disease. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). \u2014 To leverage the work done thus far in a meaningful way and make measurable progress towards a cure for ALS patients, the Committee encourages NIH to bring together researchers to capitalize on recent advancements, augment existing efforts by bringing into the fight against ALS leading researchers from other, more developed disciplines, and ex-pedite the drive towards a cure for ALS. The Committee encour-ages NIH to incentivize the continued exploration of novel thera-peutic pathways and support additional clinical trials, increasing the likelihood that the progress of the last decade can germinate into cures with the next decade. Brain Aneurysm. \u2014The Committee continues to be concerned that an estimated one out of 50 individuals in the U.S. has a brain an-eurysm, and an estimated 30,000 Americans suffer from a brain aneurysm rupture each year. The Committee is concerned that not enough research is focused on prevention of brain aneurysm rup-tures and urges NINDS to increase research on preventing brain aneurysm ruptures. BRAIN Initiative. \u2014The Committee directs NIH to transfer $50,000,000 from the NIH Innovation Account to NINDS to support the BRAIN Initiative. These funds were authorized in the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255). This collaborative effort is revo-lutionizing the understanding of how neural components and their dynamic interactions result in complex behaviors, cognition, and disease, while accelerating the development of transformative tools to explore the brain in unprecedented ways, making information previously beyond reach accessible. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). \u2014The Committee com- mends NIH on its ongoing ME/CFS efforts, including the unani-mous adoption of the National Advisory Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NANDS) Council Working Group by the full NANDS Coun-cil, the Thinking the Future: A Workshop for Young/Early Career ME/CFS Investigators workshop, and the continued investment in the Collaborative Research Centers (CRC) Consortium. The Com-mittee remains concerned that these initiatives are not making progress fast enough to meet the urgent needs of millions of Amer- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul children suffering with ME/CFS today. The Com- mittee encourages NIH to accelerate and expand efforts for ME/ CFS; such as: (1) accelerating the progress of the NIH ME/CFS In-tramural Study by publishing and sharing data, (2) issuing new ME/CFS disease specific funding announcements, (3) coordinating an initiative to develop an interagency consensus on the selection criteria for study participants involved in ME/CFS research, and (4) implementing mechanisms to incentivize new and early career researchers to enter and contribute data to the ME/CFS scientific field. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy .\u2014Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a severe type of muscular dystrophy for which there is no cure and for which the average life expectancy is in the second decade. The Committee strongly encourages NIH to significantly expand its support for research on Duchenne muscular dystrophy, particularly accelerating and optimizing the clinical trial process through novel and innovative trial designs, such as platform trials, which might serve as a model for other rare diseases communities. The Com-mittee also urges NIH to support methodological research on chal-lenges, such as redosing, manufacturing supply, and potential im-mune response, associated with the advent of gene therapies for rare diseases such as Duchenne. Dystonia. \u2014The Committee notes the recommendations from the conference on dystonia held by NINDS to revitalize the dystonia re-search portfolio were recently released. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justification on the release of the recommendations and new research and therapeutic needs that the conference identified. The Committee encourages NINDS to work with other dystonia research related Institutes such as the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communica-tion Disorders (NIDCD) and the National Eye Institute (NEI) on research that will lead to a better understanding of dystonia eti-ology and evaluation of the current status of translational research that may lead to more treatment options for those affected by dystonia. Expanded Access for ALS Treatment. \u2014The Committee supports efforts to expand access for neurodegenerative diseases with no dis-ease modifying treatments. The Committee encourages NINDS to collaborate with stakeholders to expand access for patients through clinical trials. Headache Disorders. \u2014The Committee strongly urges NINDS to consider funding applications on fundamental, translational, and clinical research on headache disorders, including migraine, post- traumatic headache, the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, and intracranial hypo/hypertension, that align with the HEAL Initia-tive's goal to achieve rapid and long-lasting solutions to the opioid crisis. Multiple Sclerosis (MS). \u2014The Committee encourages NINDS to prioritize studies that develop the medical understanding of the progression of MS and advance research on prevention strategies, treatments, and cures for MS. Muscular Dystrophy. \u2014The Committee is aware of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's (NICHD's) Data and Specimen Hub (DASH) project to create a centralized resource to store and access de-identified VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul studies. The Committee encourages NINDS to work with NICHD to explore utilizing the DASH site for NINDS studies. Myotonic Dystrophy. \u2014The Committee recognizes there are sig- nificant opportunities to advance the science regarding the causes of myotonic dystrophy, a serious degenerative genetic condition, and support current efforts to develop the first ever FDA-approved treatment for this inherited genetic disorder. The Committee di-rects NIH to prioritize the recruitment of young researchers to this field to grow the number of high-quality research proposals sub-mitted for peer review as these efforts hold significant promise for major advances across many neurodegenerative diseases, particu-larly other triplet repeat expansion diseases. The Committee re-quests an update on these activities in the fiscal year 2022 Con-gressional Justification. Opioids. \u2014The Committee continues to support the HEAL (Help- ing to End Addiction Long-Term) Initiative, a trans-NIH effort to speed scientific solutions to stem the national opioid public health crisis. This initiative builds on extensive, well-established NIH re-search, including basic science of the complex neurological path-ways involved in pain and addiction, implementation of science to develop and test treatment models, and research to integrate be-havioral interventions with medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder. The Committee includes no less than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level of $266,300,000 within NINDS for this re-search. Peripheral Neuropathies. \u2014The Committee notes the continued progress of ongoing research into Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), and related conditions. The Committee encourages NINDS to continue its work with NIAID and stakeholders on a state of the science con-ference on evolving research and scientific mechanisms. Sleep Disorders. \u2014The Committee notes the leadership of NINDS in advancing research into under-represented sleep disorders, such as narcolepsy and restless leg syndrome, and encourages NINDS to bolster these activities and pursue initiatives that advance sci-entific understanding of specific sleep disorders impacting patients. Stroke. \u2014Despite remarkable progress to reduce the stroke mor- tality rate, it is still the most common cause of severe long-term disability. The Committee supports continued research to improve the scientific understanding of stroke and clinical trials that are developing new treatments and improved approaches to stroke re-covery and rehabilitation through the NIH-funded clinical trials network StrokeNet. The Committee supports continued stroke-re-lated research conducted through the BRAIN Initiative that seeks to discover how brain circuits rewire themselves to repair damage that occurs during a stroke and that may lead to effective treat-ments to mitigate this damage in the future. Understanding that stroke is a largely preventable disorder, the Committee supports ongoing population studies that seek to reveal the reasons for stroke disparities found in communities, especially in rural States in the stroke belt. The Committee further supports additional re-search exploring how, and the extent to which, the accumulation of white matter lesions in the brain are related to stroke and demen- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul collaborative research among NIH Insti- tutes related to vascular dementia. Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Mitigation. \u2014The Committee un- derstands that research on regenerative medicine and neuroplasticity, including the use of adult stem cells and neuroplasticity, may play an important role in developing treat-ments and identifying therapeutic targets for neuroprotection pre/ post TBI. The Committee urges NINDS to work with all relevant Institutes and Centers, including NIA, to support a robust and co-ordinated portfolio of TBI research that explores all promising ave-nues to facilitate functional repair of damaged circuitry in TBI. Such analysis should include research on regenerative medicine and neuroplasticity, inclusive to preventative approaches in reduc-ing risk or to eliminate vulnerabilities from a TBI. A potential miti-gation approach is to develop interventions that protect from the delayed effects of TBI and associated pathology before they occur. The Committee directs NINDS to provide an update regarding these specific areas of TBI research in the fiscal year 2022 Con-gressional Justification. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES (NIAID) Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $5,885,470,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 5,445,886,000 ............................................................. 6,013,087,000 Change from ......................................................... +127,617,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +567,201,000 Committee Recommendation (including Title VI) ........................... 6,391,821,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +506,351,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +945,935,000 In addition, the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supple- mental Appropriations Act included $826,000,000 and the CARES Act included $706,000,000 for NIAID to conduct and support re-search to develop diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines for COVID-19. Mission. \u2014The NIAID mission is to conduct and support basic and applied research to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases. Autoimmune Neuropathies. \u2014The Committee is pleased at the progress between NIAID and NINDS on a state-of-the-science con-ference on autoimmune neuropathies research into conditions like Guillain-Barre syndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. The Committee continues to encourage both Insti-tutes to continue their work with patient stakeholders on this im-portant conference. Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases. \u2014The Committee recognizes the threat of emerging infectious diseases from bats and urges NIAID to fund research into the immunological basis for per-sistence and clearance of emerging infections; defining common fea-tures that underlie emerging infectious disease syndromes, such as viral hemorrhagic fever and severe acute respiratory distress; and clarifying mechanisms that facilitate transmission of zoonotic pathogens from reservoir hosts (e.g. bats) to humans. The Com-mittee supports the ongoing work of the National Biocontainment Laboratories (NBLs) as a national resource. Given the ongoing threat of emerging infectious diseases, such as the 2019 novel coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19, the Committee en- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, to expand its research infrastructure and facilities to include additional existing BSL 4 labs to conduct research that will facilitate the development of next generation therapeutics, diagnostics and vaccines for infectious diseases. Celiac Disease. \u2014The Committee supports NIH research on celiac disease, including the autoimmune causation underpinning the af-fliction. Today, the only known treatment for this disease is a glu-ten-free diet, but recent research reveals that this strategy is insuf-ficient for many who suffer from celiac disease. The Committee urges NIAID to support new research and to better coordinate ex-isting research with NIDDK and the other Institutes and Centers. The Committee requests that NIAID report back in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justification on the progress made towards promoting, recruiting, and supporting additional celiac-focused re-search. Centers for AIDS Research. \u2014As part of the Ending the HIV Epi- demic initiative, the Committee includes $61,000,000 for the Cen-ters for AIDS Research, an increase of $10,000,000 above the esti-mated fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2021 budget request. These Centers offer evidence-based prac-tices on prevention and treatment to initiative partners and sup-port for evaluating the initiative. Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria. \u2014The Committee main- tains funding for NIAID research related to combating antibiotic- resistant bacteria. These funds enable NIAID to support research on antimicrobial (drug) resistance, including basic research on how microbes develop resistance, new and faster diagnostics, and clin-ical trials designed to find new vaccines and treatments effective against drug-resistant microbes. Food Allergies. \u2014The Committee recognizes the serious issue of food allergies which affect approximately eight percent of children and ten percent of adults in the U.S. The Committee commends the ongoing work of NIAID in supporting a total of 17 clinical sites for this critical research, including seven sites as part of the Consor-tium of Food Allergy Research (CoFAR). The Committee strongly encourages NIAID to expand support for the CoFAR. Gonorrhea. \u2014The Committee continues to be concerned about the prevalence of gonorrhea, the 75 percent increase in the incidence of this disease over the past eleven years, and the drug resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics. The Committee commends NIAID for its efforts in developing new antibiotics to combat the bacterium that causes this disease and encourages NIAID to continue its work toward better diagnosis, treatments, and cures for this STI. Hepatitis B (HBV) .\u2014The Committee commends NIAID for its leadership to develop the Trans-NIH Strategic Plan to Cure Hepa-titis B and urges NIAID to issue targeted calls for research to im-plement and fund the Strategic Plan. The Committee notes that in-fection with HBV is a serious public health threat. One in 20 Americans have been infected with HBV, and more than two mil-lion Americans are chronically infected, increasing by 70,000 a year. In addition, HBV results in over 780,000 worldwide deaths each year. To implement the Strategic Plan, the Committee encour-ages NIAID to use contracts, program announcements, and re-search resources initiatives to stimulate new research applications and facilitate ongoing work. The Committee requests that NIAID VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul submit, within 90 days of enactment of this Act, an update to the HBV Strategic plan focused on a cure for HBV in coordination with the Trans-NIH Hepatitis B Working Group. Hereditary Angioedema (HAE). \u2014The Committee notes NIAID's meaningful progress in advancing research and diagnosis for pa-tients who suffer from HAE caused by C1 inhibitor deficiency and encourages NIAID to facilitate basic and clinical genetic and bio-chemical research focused on understanding swelling in patients with normal C1 inhibitor. Inflammatory Disorders. \u2014The Committee supports expanded re- search into the treatment of inflammation. Inflammation is one of the body's major defense mechanisms in response to infection or in-jury, but when it is uncontrolled, it causes inflammatory diseases such as COPD, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, otitis media, and cancer. Lyme Disease Vaccine Development. \u2014With an estimated 300,000 new cases of Lyme disease reported each year, the Committee en-courages NIAID to expand its research on tick-borne disease, in-cluding prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. The Committee com-mends the NIAID's strategic plan for combating tick-borne illnesses to include vaccine development and encourages NIAID to focus its attention on supporting the most promising Lyme disease vaccine candidate clinical trials. Microbicides. \u2014The Committee recognizes that with NIH and USAID leadership, research has shown the potential for antiretroviral (ARV) drugs to prevent HIV infection in women. The Committee encourages NIAID to continue coordination with USAID, the State Department, and others to advance ARV-based microbicide development efforts with the goal of enabling regu-latory approval of the first safe and effective microbicide for women and supporting an active ARV-based microbicide pipeline to produce additional solutions to prevent HIV and help end the epi-demic. Pandemic Influenza. \u2014T cell-mediated immunity plays a central role in controlling viral infections. To create a universal influenza vaccine, the Committee encourages NIAID to prioritize research to facilitate the application of vaccines that induce strong cross-reac-tive T cell responses as a complementary or alternative approach to vaccines primarily designed to elicit an antibody response. Syphilis. \u2014The Committee continues to be concerned about the increased cases of syphilis, the rise in congenital syphilis, and the link between syphilis and transmitting HIV. The Committee com-mends the NIAID for their work in this area and encourages accel-eration in the development of screening tests, vaccines for preven-tion, and new treatment options, for both adults and newborns, to provide a fasts and efficient way to diagnose and define the stages of this infection. Tuberculosis. \u2014The Committee encourages NIAID to continue to support research on tuberculosis. Universal Influenza Vaccine. \u2014The Committee directs NIAID to allocate at least $240,000,000, an increase of $40,000,000 over the fiscal year 2020 level, to support basic, translational, and clinical research to develop a universal influenza vaccine that provides ro-bust, long-lasting protection against multiple subtypes of flu, rath-er than a select few. Such a vaccine would eliminate the need to VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, update and administer the seasonal flu vaccine each year and could provide protection against newly emerging flu strains, potentially including those that could cause a flu pandemic. The Committee di-rects NIAID to allocate the increase in funding to clinical research. The Committee requests an update on these efforts within 60 days of enactment of this Act. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES (NIGMS) Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $2,937,218,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 2,672,074,000 ............................................................. 2,972,479,000 Change from ......................................................... +35,261,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +300,405,000 Committee Recommendation (including Title VI) ........................... 3,161,491,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +224,273,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +489,417,000 Mission. \u2014NIGMS supports basic research that increases our un- derstanding of biological processes and lays the foundation for ad-vances in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Forecasting and Modeling Partnerships for Countering Infectious Diseases. \u2014The Committee believes that emerging viral threats such as COVID-19 highlight the need for innovative and real-time forecasting and modeling techniques to ensure the U.S. is best posi-tioned to respond to emerging public health threats. The Com-mittee encourages NIGMS and the Fogarty International Center (FIC) to continue to support emerging infectious disease forecasting and modeling methods and monitoring data developed by univer-sity and private partners. The Committee encourages NIGMS and FIC to prioritize funding and explore partnerships to improve our ability to respond to public health and national security threats through emerging infectious disease modeling and forecasting. Institutional Development Awards (IDeA). \u2014The Committee pro- vides $396,573,000 for IDeA, $10,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. IDeA supports high-quality research and inves-tigators throughout the country in States in which the success rate for NIH grants has been historically low. Minority Access to Research Careers (MARC). \u2014The Committee includes continued support for the MARC Program, which provides research training opportunities for underrepresented minority stu-dents and faculty in biomedical and behavioral sciences relevant to biomedicine, including mathematics and engineering. Science Education Partnership Awards (SEPA). \u2014The Committee continues to support the SEPA program, which supports edu-cational activities and workforce training for teachers to expand op-portunities for students from underserved communities to consider careers in basic or clinical research. Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Regional Accelerator Hubs. \u2014The Committee remains concerned with the lower levels of STTR funding in IDeA States compared to non-IDeA States. In re-sponse to this discrepancy, NIGMS funded four STTR Regional Ac-celerator Hubs to help build entrepreneurial cultures in IDeA States through developing technology transfer networks, providing entrepreneurial training, and leveraging resources. The Committee continues to support this program and encourages NIGMS to pro-vided funding at a lever sufficient for initial awards to be renewed. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT (NICHD) Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $1,556,879,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 1,416,366,000 ............................................................. 1,570,269,000 Change from ......................................................... +13,390,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +153,903,000 Committee Recommendation (including Title VI) ........................... 1,670,455,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +113,576,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +254,089,000 Mission. \u2014NICHD investigates human development throughout the entire life process, with a focus on understanding disabilities and important events that occur during pregnancy. Addressing Maternal Mortality Disparities. \u2014The Committee en- courages NICHD to continue its support of research into the lead-ing causes of maternal morbidity and mortality. As Black women experience maternal mortality at nearly four times the rate of white women, the Committee strongly urges NICHD to support re-search that investigates factors contributing to this disparity, and test evidence-based interventions to address this disparity. The Committee also encourages NICHD to collaborate with the Na-tional Institute for Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) as appropriate to develop targeted funding opportunities. Congenital Syphilis (CS). \u2014The Committee continues to be con- cerned about the rise of congenital syphilis and the lifelong health effects the disease can have on children. The Committee encour-ages NICHD to prioritize research in this area and to work with NIAID on new testing, diagnosis, and treatment efforts. Endometriosis. \u2014Endometriosis affects one in ten women, can cause intense pain, and is a leading cause of infertility. Despite its prevalence and health impact, there has been little investment in research to better understand this condition. Such research could lead to better health outcomes for millions of women. The Com-mittee strongly encourages NICHD to significantly increase fund-ing to expand basic, clinical, and translational research into the mechanics of endometriosis, identify early diagnostic markers, and develop new treatment methods. Human Microbiome. \u2014The Committee appreciates the NICHD 2020 strategic plan's key research themes, including: (1) promoting gynecologic, andrologic, and reproductive health, and (2) setting the foundation for healthy pregnancies and lifelong wellness. The Com-mittee commends NICHD's partnership with the Office of the Di-rector on the Human Microbiome Project, which has led to valuable scientific discoveries related to women's reproductive health and pregnancy. The Committee urges continued focus on the human microbiome and expanded investigation into the impact of the microbiome of the female reproductive tract on women's health and pregnancy outcomes, including larger collaborative and inter-disciplinary multi-omic projects cognizant of health disparities among racial and ethnic populations. Human Milk Research. \u2014The Committee encourages NICHD to expand its research on human milk, including by expanding the re-search pipeline by supporting graduate and postdoctoral fellow-ships in this area. In addition, the Committee encourages NICHD to establish a research center network for human milk research to VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, facilitate support for shared resources and infrastructure for human milk research. Learning Disabilities Research. \u2014The Committee is concerned with the decline in achievement for students with disabilities and recognizes the need for continued research and improved interven-tions. The Committee recognizes the importance of NICHD's fund-ing of Learning Disabilities Research Centers and Learning Dis-abilities Innovation Hubs, which are the only source of Federal funding available to researchers interested in exploring child devel-opment and learning disabilities to conduct randomized control trials and explore the relationships between different variables at work. While learning disabilities affect an individual's education and academic achievement, these disorders are brain-based, and clinical research using the latest technology and advances in neuro-science is essential. The Committee encourages NICHD to continue its robust research into language, reading development, learning disabilities, and disorders that adversely affect the development of listening, speaking, reading, writing, and mathematics abilities. The Committee also encourages NICHD to increase its investment in its Learning Disabilities Research Centers and Learning Disabil-ities Innovation Hubs. Male Reproductive Health. \u2014The Committee urges NICHD to support research on male mechanisms of infertility. In fiscal year 2020, the Committee encouraged NICHD to support research on male infertility and requests a report on progress in this area in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justification. Due to the gap in knowledge of how to diagnose and treat male infertility and abnor-mal embryo development, the Committee reiterates its priority in-terest. The Committee requests a report within 90 days of enact-ment of this Act detailing NICHD's existing collaborations and re-search to identify new proteins and sperm structures that are nec-essary for normal sperm foundation and, consequently, for fertility and embryo development. Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units (MFMU) Network. \u2014The Com- mittee supports the critical work of the MFMU Network in improv-ing health outcomes for pregnant women and their babies. Leveraging existing infrastructure to address maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity in the U.S. is critical. The Com-mittee understands that NICHD is considering several models of infrastructure for its networks and encourages NICHD to maintain the features that made the MFMU Network successful and cost-ef-fective, including the renewal process that maximizes efficiency and ability to conduct multiple large trials with long term follow up over many years. Such an infrastructure is essential for main-taining a collective repository of knowledge and skills as well as a stable foundation for data sharing and workforce development. The Committee looks forward to reports about the process for restruc-turing and final outcomes once a final decision has been made with respect to the new infrastructure. Maternal-Fetal Transmission of Lyme Disease. \u2014The HHS Tick- Borne Disease Working Group's Clinical Aspects of Lyme Disease Subcommittee January 2020 report includes ''further evaluate po-tential maternal-fetal transmission of Lyme disease and of con-genital Lyme disease'' as a recommended priority. The Committee urges NIH to evaluate potential maternal-fetal transmission of VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul disease and congenital Lyme disease and issue requests for proposals and funding opportunity announcements to stimulate re-searcher interest in these areas. Within 180 days of enactment of this Act, the Committee requests a report on NIH plans to address the need for research on maternal-fetal transmission of B. burgdorferi , congenital Lyme disease, and adverse outcomes in in- fants and children from maternal transmission. Maternal Mortality Research. \u2014The Committee supports NIH ef- forts to establish the Implementing a Maternal Health and Preg-nancy Outcomes Vision for Everyone (IMPROVE) Initiative. The initiative will use an integrated approach to understand biological, behavioral, sociocultural, and structural factors that affect severe maternal mortality and maternal mortality (SMM/MM) by building an evidence base for improved care and outcomes in specific regions of the country. IMPROVE will target health disparities associated with SMM/MM by (1) implementing and evaluating community- based interventions for disproportionately affected women (e.g., Af-rican American, American Indian/Alaska Native, advanced mater-nal age, low socioeconomic status, and rural populations), and (2) identifying risk factors and the underlying biological mechanisms associated with leading causes of SMM/MM, including cardio-vascular disease, infection and immunity, and mental health. Participation of Pregnant and Lactating Individuals in COVID- 19 Research. \u2014The Committee directs NICHD, within 90 days of enactment of this Act, to submit a report to the Committee describ-ing the specific steps being taken to ensure racially, ethnically, and geographically diverse participation in studies conducted to under-stand the effects of COVID-19 on pregnant and lactating individ-uals. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). \u2014PCOS affects up to 15 per- cent of women and has metabolic, reproductive, mental, and mater-nal/child health manifestations. PCOS is the most common endo-crine disorder in women and is a significant risk factor for high blood pressure, sleep disorders, heart disease, pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, cholesterol disorders, and other dis-orders that impact cardiovascular and metabolic health. The Com-mittee encourages NICHD to partner with NHLBI to promote re-search in PCOS, particularly with a focus on comorbidities associ-ated with PCOS that impact heart, blood, lung, sleep, and mater-nal/fetal health as they contribute to negative health outcomes. The Committee also encourages NHLBI to report on research that has been conducted on PCOS and its impact on cardiovascular health to date in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justification. Population Research. \u2014The Committee recognizes NICHD for supporting innovative population research and research training programs, longitudinal surveys, and research on the social deter-minants of health and on the development of low-cost data archiving, data curation, and data sharing strategies that both pro-tect survey participants and provide unparalleled access for re-searchers. The Committee encourages NICHD to highlight these strategies as it works with NIH leadership to implement its data sharing and management policy. Further, the Committee urges NICHD to continue supporting large-scale data collection activities, especially prospective, population-representative longitudinal stud-ies, and to continue its leadership in supporting research on the so- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, of health, morbidity, and mortality across the lifespan, including maternal and infant health. Premature Birth Research. \u2014The Committee supports NIH's ef- forts to expand neonatal research to improve the treatment and health outcomes of premature babies and explore ways to support multi-site clinical trials in pregnancy and lactation, which will lay the foundation for optimal clinical care for these infants. Research in Pregnant and Lactating Women. \u2014The Committee is pleased with the progress being made by the Task Force on Re-search Specific to Pregnant Women and Lactating Women in iden-tifying and developing strategies to address gaps in knowledge and research on safe and effective therapies for pregnant and lactating women to carry out the recommendations in its 2018 report. The Committee directs NICHD to provide the Task Force's rec-ommendations to the Committee within 60 days of enactment of this Act. The Committee also directs NICHD, along with other rel-evant NIH Institutes and Centers, CDC, FDA, and other relevant agencies, to prepare to implement these recommendations to the extent appropriate and feasible under the legal authorities avail-able to the Secretary. Finally, the Committee directs NICHD, in conjunction with the Secretary, to report back to the Committee on the feasibility of implementing these policies and any additional authorizations or appropriations required in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justification. Strategic Plan. \u2014The Committee has reviewed NICHD's 2020 Strategic Plan and believes that there is insufficient focus on be-havioral health, cognition, development of young children, lan-guage, learning differences, and school readiness. NICHD has long history of funding critical and meritorious work in these areas. The Committee encourages NICHD to consider otherwise qualified grants in these areas on the same basis as any other areas of focus as it works to implement its strategic plan. NATIONAL EYE INSTITUTE (NEI) Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $824,090,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 749,003,000 ............................................................. 831,177,000 Change from ......................................................... +7,087,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +82,174,000 Committee Recommendation (including Title VI) ........................... 884,208,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +60,118,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +135,205,000 Mission. \u2014NEI conducts and supports basic and clinical research, research training, and other programs with respect to blinding eye diseases, visual disorders, and mechanisms of visual function, pres-ervation of sight, and the special health problems and needs of in-dividuals who are visually-impaired or blind. Academic and Non-Profit Institutional Research Using Human Ocular Tissue from Not-for-Profit Eye Banks. \u2014Macular degenera- tion is the leading cause of blindness and impacts some 15 million people in the U.S., with an estimated 200,000 new cases annually. The Committee is aware that, due to the high cost of human ocular tissue, many academic researchers resort to using animal tissue when studying diseases and conditions of the eye. This is problem-atic as animal tissue is not a perfect equivalent to human tissue, and certain diseases, such as macular degeneration, are not VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul present in animal tissue. The Committee encourages NEI to con- sider establishing an ocular tissue program to achieve cost savings and facilitate critical ocular research utilizing tissue provided by non-profit organizations to academic and other not-for-profit re-search entities. Such a program could facilitate critical research to eradicate the debilitating impact of macular degeneration and other ocular disorders. Blepharospasm. \u2014The Committee continues to encourage NEI to pursue collaboration with stakeholders on cross-cutting research opportunities that affect all forms of dystonia, including blepharospasm. The Committee notes the opportunity to collabo-rate with NINDS and NIDCD from the 2018 dystonia conference and encourages all three Institutes to work together to advance critical research. Eye Bonds. \u2014The Committee recognizes the monumental strides being made in medical research, but is also concerned about the growing need to fund translational research in what is known as the valley of death, that area between basic science and the devel-opment of a patient-ready product. Eye disease in America is one such challenge with significant human and economic consequences. In America, 4.24 million adults are blind or have vision impair-ment, and among working-age blind adults, 70.5 percent are not employed full-time. The economic burden of eye diseases is esti-mated to be $138 billion a year. The Committee encourages NEI to work with other Institutes and Centers, other agencies within HHS, and stakeholder organizations to examine novel methods to fund translational research and bridge the valley of death. Macular Degeneration. \u2014The Committee is concerned with ad- vanced age-related macular degeneration as the leading cause of ir-reversible blindness and vision impairment globally. At least 11 million people in the U.S. have some form of macular degeneration and that number is expected to double to 22 million by 2050. The Committee encourages NIH to fund research that will stem the growth of macular degeneration and requests an update on current research and future initiatives in the fiscal year 2022 Congres-sional Justification. Vision Research. \u2014The number of Americans with visual impair- ment or blindness is expected to double to more than 8 million by 2050. The Committee recognizes NEI's research to advance the un-derstanding of the causes of these afflictions and potential treat-ments and encourages NEI to expand these research activities. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES (NIEHS) Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $802,598,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 730,147,000 ............................................................. 809,501,000 Change from ......................................................... +6,903,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +79,354,000 Committee Recommendation (including Title VI) ........................... 861,149,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +58,551,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +131,002,000 Mission. \u2014NIEHS's mission is to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives. Air Pollution and Asthma. \u2014The Committee notes with concern the evidence suggesting a causal link between air pollution and the development of asthma. The Committee urges NIEHS to explore VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul this potential causal link and any interventions necessary to pre- vent the development of asthma. Harmful Algal Blooms Human Health Effects Research. \u2014The Committee recognizes the value of the NIEHS mission and the NIEHS-NSF jointly-funded Oceans and Human Health Program as a means to increase scientific knowledge about short-term and long-term human health effects associated with acute and chronic exposures to toxins produced by harmful algal blooms (HABs). The Committee recognizes the increasing relevance of this scientific re-search to communities directly affected by HABs, including in Flor-ida, where one of the longest documented HABs in the State's his-tory occurred from late 2017 through early 2019. The Committee encourages NIEHS to continue investing in this research area using its competitive, peer-reviewed grantmaking processes. In par-ticular, the Committee notes growing scientific interest in further investigating respiratory irritation and illness associated with in-halation of aerosolized HAB toxins and neurotoxic shellfish poi-soning arising from ingestion of contaminated seafood. The Com-mittee commends NIEHS for its collaborations with other agencies, including the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Environmental Protec-tion Agency (EPA), and CDC, to advance research about HABs and translate key research findings for clinical and public health bene-fits. Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Research. \u2014The Committee appreciates NIEHS's support for research into understanding the toxic properties of PFAS chemicals and the potential adverse health effects of PFAS exposure. Research to date has revealed an association between PFAS exposures and adverse health outcomes, including the potential for effects on children's cognitive and behav-ioral development, immune system dysfunction, endocrine disrup-tion, obesity, diabetes, and cancer. More research is necessary to fully understand the impact of PFAS exposure on health. The Com-mittee strongly encourages NIEHS to continue to support research on human exposure to PFAS chemicals. NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING (NIA) Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $3,543,673,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 3,225,782,000 ............................................................. 3,609,150,000 Change from ......................................................... +65,477,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +383,368,000 Committee Recommendation (including Title VI) ........................... 3,837,188,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +293,515,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +611,406,000 Mission. \u2014NIA's mission is to understand the nature of aging and the aging process, and diseases and conditions associated with growing older, in order to extend the healthy, active years of life. Alzheimer's Disease. \u2014In recognition that Alzheimer's disease poses a serious threat to the nation's long-term health and eco-nomic stability, the Committee recommends a total of no less than $2,853,000,000 for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias re-search, $35,000,000 above the estimated fiscal year 2020 level. The Committee encourages NIA to continue to address the research goals set forth in the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease, as well as the recommendations from the Alzheimer's Disease Re- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul in 2015 and 2018, the Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias Research Summits in 2017 and 2020, and the Dementia Care and Services Research Summit in 2017. In addition, the Com-mittee is concerned about the racial and ethnic disparities that exist in Alzheimer's disease diagnoses and encourages NIA to sup-port research exploring the disproportionate impact Alzheimer's disease has on people of color, particularly African-Americans, who are two times more likely to develop late-onset Alzheimer's disease than whites. Population Research. \u2014The Committee recognizes the NIA Na- tional Advisory Council on Aging (NACA) for conducting a recent review of NIA's Division of Behavioral and Social Research. The re-view reinforced the value of NIA's investment in an array of popu-lation aging research activities, including large-scale, longitudinal studies such as the Health and Retirement Study, which is the na-tion's leading source of combined data on health and socioeconomic circumstances of Americans over age 50, and its center programs, such as the Centers on the Demography and Economics of Aging, which are conducting research on the demographic, economic, so-cial, and health consequences of U.S. and global aging at 11 univer-sities and organizations nationwide. The Committee urges NIA to sustain its investment in these activities in fiscal year 2021 and to consider, as the NACA review recommended, expanding research opportunities that will advance our understanding of the factors throughout the life course that contribute to the poor overall health of older people in America and the growing disparities in some parts of the country as well as the disparities between the US and other countries. Thalassemia. \u2014Thanks to significant advances in medical science, thalassemia patients and others dealing with chronic diseases are now living well into adulthood, some even into their 60s. While this is a tremendous victory for research, it has opened new questions. Among these are female and male reproductive issues, the impact of non-disease related medicines, the relationship to diseases of aging such as Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, Parkin-son's, arthritis, osteoporosis, and more. The Committee requests that NIA review these issues and report back on the steps that will be taken to address them in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Jus-tification. Update NIH Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia Screening Tools. \u2014The Committee remains very interested in opportunities to detect cognitive impairment that may be caused by Alzheimer's dis-ease and related dementias as early as possible. The Committee di-rects NIH to update its analysis of validated screening tools, in-cluding digital screening tools, that are able to reliably detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This review should focus on identi-fying tools that have been developed in the time since the last as-sessment was conducted and on providing information to assist healthcare providers in regularly using such tools to assess the cog-nitive health of their patients. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, OF ARTHRITIS AND MUSCULOSKELETAL AND SKIN DISEASES (NIAMS) Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $624,889,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 568,480,000 ............................................................. 630,263,000 Change from ......................................................... +5,374,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +61,783,000 Committee Recommendation (including Title VI) ........................... 670,475,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +45,586,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +101,995,000 Mission. \u2014NIAMS's mission is to support research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases; the training of basic and clinical scientists to carry out this research; and the dissemination of information on re-search progress in these diseases. Alopecia. \u2014Alopecia affects 6.8 million Americans, including chil- dren, and disproportionately impacts women of color. The Com-mittee encourages NIAMS to work with relevant Institutes and Centers, including NIMHD, to develop possible collaborative efforts to increase research into this disparity, specifically among Black and Hispanic women, and pursue collaborative opportunities that will lead to new research discoveries. Musculoskeletal Research. \u2014The NIH has made significant progress in terms of diversity in musculoskeletal research and has included it as a priority in its 2020-2024 strategic plan. The Com-mittee encourages NIAMS to support additional focused research into sexual dimorphism, race/ethnicity, and socio-economic status and how these factors relate to injury prevention, levels of disease activity and functional status, access, and quality of care across the lifespan. Specifically, we recommend that NIAMS issue Request for Applications (RFA) or Participatory Action Research (PAR) grant programs on disparities similar to those of the NIMHD or NCI. In addition, the Committee encourages NIAMS to support further re-search on rural inequities in musculoskeletal care in terms of ad-dressing occupational injury types and resulting complications due to limited specialty care access. NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DEAFNESS AND OTHER COMMUNICATION DISORDERS (NIDCD) Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $490,692,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 446,397,000 ............................................................. 494,912,000 Change from ......................................................... +4,220,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +48,515,000 Committee Recommendation (including Title VI) ........................... 526,488,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +35,796,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +80,091,000 Mission. \u2014NIDCD conducts and supports biomedical and behav- ioral research and research training in the normal and disordered processes of hearing, balance, taste, smell, voice, speech, and lan-guage. NIDCD also conducts and supports research and research training related to disease prevention and health promotion; ad-dresses special biomedical and behavioral problems associated with people who have communication impairments or disorders; and supports efforts to create devices which substitute for lost and im-paired sensory and communication function. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, notes the work that NIDCD has done in conducting research on spasmodic dysphonia and encourages NIDCD to work with stakeholders to advance crit-ical research resulting from the 2018 dystonia conference. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NURSING RESEARCH (NINR) Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $169,113,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 156,804,000 ............................................................. 170,567,000 Change from ......................................................... +1,454,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +13,763,000 Committee Recommendation (including Title VI) ........................... 181,450,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +12,337,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +24,646,000 Mission. \u2014The mission of NINR is to promote and improve the health of individuals, families, and communities. To achieve this mission, NINR supports and conducts clinical and basic research and research training on health and illness, research that spans and integrates the behavioral and biological sciences, and develops the scientific basis for clinical practice. NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISM (NIAAA) Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $545,373,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 497,346,000 ............................................................. 550,063,000 Change from ......................................................... +4,690,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +52,717,000 Committee Recommendation (including Title VI) ........................... 585,158,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +39,785,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +87,812,000 Mission. \u2014NIAAA's mission is to generate and disseminate fun- damental knowledge about the effects of alcohol on health and well-being, and apply that knowledge to improve diagnosis, preven-tion, and treatment of alcohol-related problems, including alcohol use disorder, across the lifespan. NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE (NIDA) Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $1,462,016,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 1,431,770,000 ............................................................. 1,474,590,000 Change from ......................................................... +12,574,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +42,820,000 Committee Recommendation (including Title VI) ........................... 1,568,672,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +106,656,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +136,902,000 Mission. \u2014NIDA's mission is to advance science on the causes and consequences of drug use and addiction and to apply that knowledge to improve individual and public health. Cannabis Research. \u2014NIH currently supports a diverse portfolio of research on cannabinoids and the endocannabinoid system, yet this research support typically relies on narrowly tailored program announcements and grants rather than a multipronged strategy wherein basic and clinical scientists and public health specialists work together to address the opportunities and challenges of can-nabis in a comprehensive manner. The Committee encourages NIDA to continue supporting a full range of research on the health effects of marijuana and its components, including research to un- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, policies affect public health, to help in- form marijuana policymaking in States. Determination of Synthetic Drug Ingestion. \u2014The Committee en- courages NIDA to support research to develop a process for rapid determination of synthetic drug ingestion. Such research should in-clude the development of metabolite profiles of opioids and their synthetic derivatives using pooled human liver microsomes and a cytochrome mixture; development of analytical methodology for rapid detection of metabolites in urine samples; development of a program that utilizes the metabolite profile that provides an output of class and drug; and validation of the methodology with simu-lated and/or real world samples. Electronic Cigarettes. \u2014The Committee understands that elec- tronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and other vaporizing equipment are increasingly popular among adolescents, and encourages NIDA to support research on the use and consequences of these devices. The Committee also supports the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study, a collaboration between NIDA and the FDA Center for Tobacco Products to help scientists learn how and why people start using tobacco products, quit using them, and start using them again after they have quit, as well as how different to-bacco products affect health outcomes over time. Kratom. \u2014The Committee encourages NIDA to expand research on all health impacts of kratom, including its constituent com-pounds, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine. The Committee is aware of the potential promise of kratom-derived compounds for acute and chronic pain patients who seek safer alternatives to sometimes dangerously addictive and potentially deadly prescrip-tion opioids. Methamphetamines and Other Stimulants. \u2014The Committee is concerned that the number of deaths from the drug categories that include methamphetamine and cocaine more than doubled from 2015-2018, leading some to refer to stimulant overdoses as the ''fourth wave'' of the current drug addiction crisis in America fol-lowing the rise of opioid-related deaths involving prescription opioids, heroin, and fentanyl-related substances. Methamphetamine is highly addictive and there are no FDA-approved treatments for methamphetamine and other stimulant use disorders. The Com-mittee continues to support NIDA's efforts to address the opioid cri-sis, has provided continued funding for the HEAL Initiative, and supports NIDA's efforts to combat the growing problem of meth-amphetamine and other stimulant use and related deaths. Opioids. \u2014The Committee continues to be extremely concerned about the epidemic of prescription opioids, heroin, and illicit syn-thetic opioid use, addiction and overdose in the U.S. In 2018, ap-proximately 185 people died each day in this country from drug overdose (128 of those deaths are directly from opioids), making it one of the most common causes of non-disease-related deaths for adolescents and young adults. This crisis has been exacerbated by the availability of illicit fentanyl and its analogs in many commu-nities. The Committee appreciates the important role that research plays in the various Federal initiatives aimed at this crisis. To com-bat this crisis, the bill includes no less than the fiscal year 2020 funding level of $266,300,000 for research related to preventing and treating opioid misuse and addiction. NIDA's opioid specific al- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 should be targeted for the following areas: development of safe and effective medications and new formulations and combina-tions to treat opioid use disorders and to prevent and reverse over-dose; conduct implementation studies to create a comprehensive care model in communities nationwide to prevent opioid misuse, ex-pand treatment capacity, enhance access to overdose reversal medi-cations, and enhance prescriber practice; test interventions in jus-tice system settings to expand the uptake of medication for addic-tion treatment and methods to scale up these interventions for pop-ulation-based impact; and develop evidence-based strategies to in-tegrate screening and treatment for opioid use disorders in emer-gency department and primary care settings. Overdose Prevention Centers. \u2014The Committee recognizes that Overdose Prevention Centers, or Supervised Consumption Sites, are part of a larger effort of harm reduction interventions intended to reduce the risk of drug overdose death and reduce the spread of infectious disease. The Committee directs NIDA, in consultation with the CDC Division of Injury Prevention and Control, to provide a report to the Committee and post publicly, no later than 180 days after the enactment of this Act providing an updated literature re-view and evaluation of the potential public health impact of Over-dose Prevention Centers in the U.S. Pain Therapeutics and Opioid Addiction Centers of Excellence. \u2014 Addictions are a chronic problem in the U.S. and are inadequately addressed in U.S. medical schools and residency training programs. The Committee strongly encourages NIDA to create regional Cen-ters of Excellence in opioid research and training to assist States in educating and implementing best practices in opioid prescribing, pain management, screening and linkage to care for individuals with opioid use disorders and addictions. The Centers should de-velop training materials for health care providers and trainees in opioid use and other addictive disorders. Raising Awareness and Engaging the Medical Community in Drug Abuse and Addiction Prevention and Treatment. \u2014Education is a critical component of any effort to curb drug use and addiction, and it must target every segment of society, including healthcare providers (doctors, nurses, dentists, and pharmacists), patients, and families. Medical professionals must be in the forefront of ef-forts to curb the opioid crisis. The Committee continues to be pleased with the NIDAMED initiative, targeting physicians-in- training, including medical students and resident physicians in pri-mary care specialties (e.g., internal medicine, family practice, and pediatrics). The Committee encourages NIDA to continue its efforts in this space, providing physicians and other medical professionals with the tools and skills needed to incorporate substance use and misuse screening and treatment into their clinical practices. The HEALthy Brain and Child Development (BCD) Study. \u2014The Committee recognizes and supports the NIH HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study, which will establish a large cohort of pregnant women from regions of the country significantly affected by the opioid crisis and follow them and their children for at least 10 years. This knowledge will be critical to help predict and pre-vent some of the known impacts of pre- and postnatal exposure to drugs or adverse environments, including risk for future substance use, mental disorders, and other behavioral and developmental VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, recognizes that the BCD Study is sup- ported in part by the NIH HEAL Initiative, and encourages other NIH Institutes, such as NICHD, NIMH, NHLBI, NCI, NIAAA, NIMH, NINR, as well as the Office of the Director to support this important study. Tobacco Regulatory Science Program. \u2014The Committee supports the Tobacco Regulatory Science Program and encourages increased research to inform the FDA in regulation of the manufacture, mar-keting, and distribution of tobacco products to reduce the public health toll from tobacco product use in the U.S. The Committee en-courages NIH to support research into the understanding of nico-tine addiction and to spur the development of better prevention and treatment strategies. Of particular importance for funding are research for effective interventions to help youth and young adults to quit vaping, and to understand the interrelationship between the vaping of tobacco and marijuana. Youth Tobacco Cessation. \u2014The Committee is concerned about the increase in youth e-cigarette addiction and the significant lack of research to inform effective therapies to help youth quit. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has determined that there is not sufficient evidence to recommend adolescent use of existing pharmacological tobacco cessation treatments that are currently approved for adults. There is great need for additional clinical trials and other research to determine if new or existing pharma-cological treatments, behavioral interventions, or combination therapies have the potential to benefit adolescents in quitting ciga-rettes and other forms of tobacco, including e-cigarettes. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH (NIMH) Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $2,038,374,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 1,844,865,000 ............................................................. 2,055,303,000 Change from ......................................................... +36,929,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +210,438,000 Committee Recommendation (including Title VI) ........................... 2,186,474,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +148,100,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +341,609,000 Mission. \u2014NIMH's mission is to transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses through basic and clinical research, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure. Addressing Youth Mental Health Disparities. \u2014The Committee is encouraged by the work of NIMH to support research on issues re-lated to youth mental health, including suicide among youth. The Committee is further encouraged by NIMH efforts to address men-tal health disparities among underrepresented and undeserved youth. To guide this continuing work, the Committee requests within 180 days of enactment of this Act, a 10-year strategic plan with long-term plan with short-term goals from NIMH with a goal of eliminating racial mental health disparities in youth by 2030. This plan should include, but is not limited to: (1) convening a consensus conference, which could be used to guide strategic plan development; (2) identifying and/or creating funding mechanisms that actively support the development of evidence-based practices for racial mental health disparities populations; (3) developing tar-geted funding opportunities for projects in communities with dis-parities starting in fiscal year 2021; and (4) developing structures VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, solicit wide-ranging community input on barriers to addressing mental health disparities. This may include quarterly workshops to solicit community input. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justification on progress towards achieving goals in this strategic plan. The Committee further encourages the Institute to convene a consensus conference that includes: leading extramural experts on health disparities; representatives from other relevant NIH Insti-tutes and Centers like the HHS Office of Minority Health, NICHD, NIMHD; and public stakeholders to discuss research opportunities and gaps, as well as evidence-based solutions and therapeutic interventions. At the conclusion of the conference, the Committee requests a report which should include priority areas for additional study to advance research in addressing mental health disparities in youth. Autism. \u2014The Committee encourages NIH to support greater in- vestment in research and collaborations focused on addressing gaps in the Strategic Plan developed by the lnteragency Autism Coordi-nating Committee, including efforts to understand the intersection of biology, behavior, and the environment. BRAIN Initiative. \u2014The Committee directs NIH to transfer $50,000,000 from the NIH Innovation Account to NIMH to support the BRAIN Initiative. These funds are authorized by the 21st Cen-tury Cures Act (P.L. 114-255). This collaborative effort is revolu-tionizing our understanding of how neural components and their dynamic interactions result in complex behaviors, cognition, and disease, while accelerating the development of transformative tools to explore the brain in unprecedented ways making information previously beyond reach accessible. Pediatric Lyme Disease. \u2014The Committee is concerned about re- ports that Lyme disease poses special risks for children in terms of neurodevelopmental disorders and psychiatric comorbidities and encourages NIMH to conduct studies on the neuropsychiatric mani-festations of pediatric Lyme disease. Suicide Prevention. \u2014The Committee continues to be alarmed with the growing rates of suicide across the country, with the CDC reporting a 30 percent increase since 1999. Suicide is currently the tenth leading cause of death for all ages and the second leading cause of death for young people aged 10 to 34. To address and com-bat this crisis, the Committee encourages NIMH to prioritize its suicide screening and prevention research efforts, with special em-phasis on producing models that are interpretable, scalable, and practical for clinical implementation, including healthcare, edu-cation, and criminal justice systems that serve populations at risk. In addition, the Committee believes increased collaboration be-tween NIMH and other Institutes holds immense value. The Com-mittee strongly encourages NIMH to partner with NIDA and NIAAA to examine the multifaceted relationship between suicide and substance use disorder (SUD), including opioid abuse. En-hanced research into these relationships will provide critical knowl-edge regarding common risk factors, and preventive and interven-tion efforts that reduce morbidity associated with suicide risk. The Committee directs NIMH to provide an update on these efforts in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justification. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul INSTITUTE (NHGRI) Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $606,349,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 550,116,000 ............................................................. 611,564,000 Change from ......................................................... +5,215,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +61,448,000 Committee Recommendation (including Title VI) ........................... 650,583,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +44,234,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +100,467,000 Mission. \u2014NHGRI's mission is to accelerate scientific and medical breakthroughs that improve human health by driving cutting-edge research, developing new technologies, and studying the impact of genomics on society. Emerging Centers of Excellence in Genomic Sciences. \u2014The Com- mittee provides no less than $15,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level, to sustain and grow the Emerging Centers of Excellence in Genomic Sciences competitive grant program. The Committee maintains prior direction that present awardees of the Centers for Excellence in Genomic Sciences program shall not be eligible to receive these grants. The Committee again urges NHGRI to include plans for sustainment of this capacity-building mecha-nism in its 2020 vision report. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF BIOMEDICAL IMAGING AND BIOENGINEERING (NIBIB) Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $403,638,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 368,111,000 ............................................................. 407,109,000 Change from ......................................................... +3,471,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +38,998,000 Committee Recommendation (including Title VI) ........................... 433,083,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +29,445,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +64,972,000 In addition, the CARES Act included $60,000,000 and the Pay- check Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act in-cluded $500,000,000 for NIBIB to conduct and support research re-lated to COVID-19. Mission. \u2014The NIBIB mission is to improve health by leading the development and accelerating the application of biomedical tech-nologies. Integrated Medical Engineering. \u2014Many recent advancements in health innovation are the result of the convergence of medicine and engineering. In the coming years, this trend holds increasing prom-ise. The Committee believes that NIH would be well suited to help develop the next generation of health innovation by investing in such programs and strongly encourages NIH to support academic medical centers which award joint degrees of Doctor of Medicine and master's degrees in engineering. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul INSTITUTE ON MINORITY HEALTH AND HEALTH DISPARITIES (NIMHD) Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $335,812,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 305,498,000 ............................................................. 343,700,000 Change from ......................................................... +7,888,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +38,202,000 Committee Recommendation (including Title VI) ........................... 365,310,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +29,498,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +59,812,000 Mission. \u2014NIMHD's mission is to lead scientific research to im- prove minority health and reduce health disparities. The Committee strongly supports the mission of NIMHD to lead scientific research to improve minority health and reduce health disparities. Persistent racial and ethnic health disparities can be largely attributed to poor social and physical determinants of health in communities of color. Advancing health equity requires a multifactorial response to address issues such as high unemploy-ment, unstable housing, lack of quality education, and inability to access health care. Reducing health disparities also requires solu-tions that are informed by and tailored to the specific racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic communities at which they are aimed. The Committee urges NIMHD to maximize funding oppor-tunities that emphasize community-based, multidisciplinary re-search focused on identifying root causes of health disparities while also informing regional health and social policy to strategically re-duce health inequity across communities. Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). \u2014The Committee notes the continued commitment of NIMHD in researching health disparities. The Committee continues to encourage collaboration with other Institutes and Centers and stakeholders to expand re-search opportunities on the APOL1 gene that causes African-Amer-icans and Latinos to be disproportionately affected by FSGS. Research Centers in Minority Institutions (RCMIs). \u2014The Com- mittee recognizes the important role of the RCMI program in devel-oping the infrastructure required to enhance biomedical research conducted at historically minority serving institutions. This infra-structure is critical to supporting the development of new inves-tigators and sustaining an established workforce conducting world- class biomedical research that emphasizes the advancement of mi-nority health and the reduction of health disparities through basic research in disease areas impacting minority communities at ab-normally high rates as well as behavioral and clinical research in these same areas. The Committee includes $80,000,000, an in-crease of $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 level, for RCMIs to ensure that critical infrastructure development in historically mi-nority graduate and health professional schools continue to be en-hanced to meet these critical needs. The Committee also recognizes the importance of the RCMI Translational Research Network in en-suring that collectively, institutions can engage in multi-site col-laborative research. The Committee notes that the RCMI program was created to pro- vide equitable means for health professions institutions with his- torical missions and precedence of serving minorities, such as His-torically Black Graduate Institutions in the health professions, the wherewithal in research infrastructure to train minority biomedical VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, explore research discovery. The Committee encour- ages the NIMHD to continue following Congressional intent for the RCMI program and follow the spirit of the original instructions provided to NIH by Congress. Research Endowment Program (REP). \u2014The Committee is con- cerned by NIMHD's lack of engagement with stakeholders and the broader community regarding REP eligibility. The Committee urges NIMHD to move forward with the recommendations made by the Advisory Council workgroup to restore endowment eligibility for REP to the original Congressional intent. The Committee re-quests that NIMHD report to the Committee on progress made to implement these recommendations prior to issuing its next FOA for REP. Unregulated Cosmetics. \u2014The Committee is concerned about the prevalence of cosmetics containing dangerous levels of mercury made available through online sales and increased global travel. Evidence suggests that these harmful unregulated cosmetics, such as skin lightening creams, are disproportionately used by women of color. The Committee encourages NIMHD to collaborate with FDA to identify research gaps in the understanding of the health effects of these products and provide a report to the Committee summa-rizing the state of science and describing NIMHD's collaboration with FDA within 180 days of enactment of this Act. Women's Health Centers of Excellence. \u2014The Committee recog- nizes that health disparities persist for women in both urban and rural communities across the country. The Committee encourages NIMHD to establish three urban and two rural academic-affiliated Centers of Excellence focused on health disparities that dispropor-tionately affect underserved and minority women. NATIONAL CENTER FOR COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH (NCCIH) Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $151,740,000 Budget fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 138,167,000 ............................................................. 153,045,000 Change from ......................................................... +1,305,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +14,878,000 Committee Recommendation (including Title VI) ........................... 162,810,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +11,070,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +24,643,000 Mission. \u2014The mission of NCCIH is to define, through rigorous scientific investigation, the usefulness and safety of complementary and integrative health interventions and their roles in improving health and health care. NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCES (NCATS) Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $832,888,000 Budget fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 787,703,000 ............................................................. 840,051,000 Change from ......................................................... +7,163,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +52,348,000 Committee Recommendation (including Title VI) ........................... 893,648,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +60,760,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +105,945,000 In addition, the CARES Act included $36,000,000 for NCATS to conduct and support research related to COVID-19. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, was established to transform the translational process so that new treatments and cures for disease can be deliv-ered to patients faster. Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA). \u2014The Com- mittee directs NIH to fund the CTSA program at not less than the level provided in fiscal year 2020. The Committee reiterates its support for the CTSA program and notes the recent contributions of this critical infrastructure program towards community engage-ment and addressing health disparities. Because CTSAs are uniquely positioned to help address physician workforce shortage issues, NCATS is encouraged to bolster the role of CTSAs in work-force development activities with an emphasis on training and ca-reer development opportunities. Collaboration with Business Incubators. \u2014The Committee urges NCATS to explore potential collaborations or funding opportunities with business incubators that host small to mid-size science, re-search, and pharmaceutical companies that use services-based ap-proaches to nurture and guide the member companies to success. The Committee believes that such collaborations offer an effective way to advance translational science and meet the NCATS mission to deliver more treatment to more people quickly. Priority consider-ation should be given to nonprofit life science incubators with a track record of success in new drug discovery, biomarker discovery, and translational biotechnology in common research themes. Gene Vector Initiative. \u2014The Committee encourages NCATS to pursue the initiative described in the fiscal year 2021 budget re-quest to create a consortium for innovation in large-scale gene vec-tor production. There is currently a bottleneck in the production of the vector therapies necessary to deliver gene therapies to patients. This initiative would improve the capacity to produce vectors and accelerate gene therapy clinical trials. Rare Cancers Therapeutics Research and Development. \u2014 Rare cancers, defined at those cancers that have fewer than six new cases per 100,000 Americans per year, represent over 30 percent of all cancers. Rare cancers present a unique research challenges for many reasons, including the difficulty in accruing enough patients to participate in clinical trials, the lack of industry focus on these cancers due to the relatively small number of patients diagnosed with each cancer, the lack of rare cancer tumor models and cell lines, and the difficulty of patients receiving accurate and precise diagnoses due in part to the lack of clinician familiarity with rare cancers. The NCATS novel scientific model has proven successful in addressing other rare diseases and would benefit rare cancer therapeutic development. Therefore, the Committee encourages NIH to establish a joint NCATS-NCI rare cancer translational medicine initiative to accelerate the study of commonalities across rare cancers and the development of platform treatments for rare cancers to help patients who often have no other options. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, INTERNATIONAL CENTER (FIC) Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $80,760,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 73,531,000 ............................................................. 86,455,000 Change from ......................................................... +5,695,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +12,924,000 Committee Recommendation (including Title VI) ........................... 91,652,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +10,892,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +18,121,000 Mission. \u2014FIC's mission is to support and facilitate global health research conducted by U.S. and international investigators, build-ing partnerships between health research institutions in the U.S. and abroad, and training the next generation of scientists to ad-dress global health needs. The Committee includes additional funding for FIC to support its mission of advancing research on and training the future bio-medical research workforce in global health. The current COVID- 19 pandemic illustrates the importance of FIC's efforts to build country capacity to enable cutting edge research at the origin of outbreaks, improving the likelihood that emerging diseases can be addressed at their source. Expanded resources will allow FIC-sup-ported researchers to continue monitoring disease outbreaks and increase preparedness for future epidemics. Global Infectious Diseases. \u2014Recent outbreaks of COVID-19, Ebola, Zika, and dengue have shown the importance of FIC's essen-tial role in global infectious disease health research training and health system strengthening to assist developing countries in ad-vancing their own research and health solutions and tools. The FIC has developed important partnerships in countries, including coun-tries unfriendly to the U.S., to not only fight malaria, neglected tropical diseases, and other infectious diseases, but also to build their capabilities to detect and treat infectious diseases that are not endemic to the U.S. prior to spreading to the U.S., thus pro-tecting Americans here at home. The Committee urges FIC to con-tinue this important work building relationships with scientists abroad to foster a stronger and more effective science workforce and health capacity on the ground, helping to detect, prevent, and treat infectious diseases while strengthening bonds of trust with the U.S. though health diplomacy in their countries. NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE (NLM) Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $456,911,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 415,665,000 ............................................................. 460,841,000 Change from ......................................................... +3,930,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +45,176,000 Committee Recommendation (including Title VI) ........................... 490,244,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +33,333,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +74,579,000 In addition, the CARES Act included $10,000,000 for NLM to support research activities related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mission. \u2014The NLM collects and organizes information important to biomedicine; serves as a national information resource for med-ical education, research, and health service activities; enhances ac-cess to biomedical literature through electronic services; serves the public by providing electronic access to reliable health information VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, supports and directs the national network of librar- ies of medicine; provides grants for research in biomedical commu-nications, medical library development, and training health infor-mation specialists; conducts and supports research in biomedical informatics and computational biology; and creates information re- sources for genomics, molecular biology, toxicology, medical images, environmental health, emergency preparedness and response, and health services research. OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR (OD) Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $2,239,787,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 2,086,463,000 ............................................................. 2,324,548,000 Change from ......................................................... +84,761,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +238,085,000 Committee Recommendation (including Title VI) ........................... 4,599,548,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +2,359,761,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +2,513,085,000 In addition, the CARES Act included $30,000,000 and the Pay- check Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act in-cluded $1,000,000,000 for OD to support and conduct research and related activities related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mission. \u2014The OD provides leadership to NIH research enter- prise and coordinates and directs initiatives that crosscut NIH. OD is responsible for the development and management of intramural and extramural research and research training policy, the review of program quality and effectiveness, the coordination of selected NIH-wide program activities, and the administration of centralized support activities essential to the operations of NIH. The items below include issues and programs specific to the Of- fice of the Director as well as those that involve multiple Institutes and Centers. Adult Cellular Therapies/Regenerative Medicine. \u2014The Com- mittee encourages NIH, in coordination with FDA and HRSA, to explore the feasibility and utility of an outcomes database for adult cellular therapies that are either FDA-approved or are being ad-ministered under FDA Investigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption protocols. The Committee also encourages en-gagement of experts and stakeholders to define data types and standards necessary for such a database. All of Us Program. \u2014The Committee provides a total of $500,000,000 for the All of Us precision medicine initiative, the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $62,041,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The total includes $109,000,000 authorized in the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114- 255) to be transferred from the NIH Innovation Account. Amyloidosis. \u2014The Committee encourages NIH to continue its ex- pansion of research efforts in amyloidosis, a group of rare diseases characterized by abnormally folded protein deposits in tissues. Am-yloidosis is often fatal, and there is no known cure. Current meth-ods of treatment are risky and unsuitable for many patients. Aver-age survival without treatment is in months. The Committee di-rects NIH to inform the Committee on the steps NIH has taken to understand the causes of amyloidosis and the measures taken to improve the diagnosis and treatment of this devastating group of diseases in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justification. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul (ALS). \u2014The Committee strongly supports the Transformative Research Award program for ALS and directs the Director to continue to fund this critical initiative in fis-cal year 2021. Animal Use in Research. \u2014The Committee is aware that in Sep- tember 2019, GAO issued a report entitled ''Animal Use in Re-search: Federal Agencies Should Assess and Report on Their Ef-forts to Develop and Promote Alternatives.'' The Committee under-stands that this report found that the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) and its member agencies have not routinely developed or reported metrics to demonstrate how their efforts to encourage the use of al-ternative methods affect animal use in research. The Committee acknowledges NIEHS for having helped establish a workgroup of ICCVAM member agencies to identify potential quantitative and qualitative metrics that could provide data for comprehensively as-sessing progress of agencies toward reducing, refining, and replac-ing animal use in research. The Committee is aware that the Envi-ronmental Protection Agency (EPA) has committed to eliminate its requests for, and funding of, whole and live animal studies by 2035. The Committee therefore directs this workgroup to actively collaborate with EPA to determine where replacement alternatives to animal testing are lacking, to ensure any gaps in currently avail-able methods to replace animal testing are filled before 2035. The Committee directs that interagency workgroup to report its find-ings to the Committee by 2022 and use these metrics to assess progress in using alternative methods at EPA, and other agencies that are part of ICCVAM, in ICCVAM's required biennial report to be issued in 2024. Artificial Intelligence. \u2014The Committee supports NIH's efforts in research using artificial intelligence. Merging the biological and computer sciences, artificial intelligence can accelerate the analysis of large, complex datasets to better understand disease and im-prove care. Behavioral Research. \u2014The Committee believes that a more ro- bust and focused NIH commitment to behavioral science research and training would yield significant improvements to the nation's health due to the important connections between behavior and health. Most of the leading public health issues facing our nation\u2014 including cancer, addiction, heart disease, mental illness, diabetes, violence, and AIDS\u2014are rooted in individual and social behavior, yet behavioral science is decentralized across NIH's Institutes and Centers, and the NIH commitment to manage and directly fund this important research is limited. The Committee directs the Di-rector to convene a special advisory panel of behavioral scientists and other community experts to complete an assessment providing recommendations on how to better integrate and realize the bene-fits to overall health from behavioral research at NIH. The Com-mittee requests that this assessment be finalized before the end of fiscal year 2021 and that a report be submitted to the Committee at that time. Biomedical Research Facilities. \u2014The bill provides $50,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $50,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request, for grants to public and/ or not-for-profit entities to expand, remodel, renovate, or alter ex- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, facilities or construct new research facilities as au- thorized under 42 U.S.C. section 283k. The Committee urges NIH to consider recommendations made by the NIH Working Group on Construction of Research Facilities, including making awards that are large enough to underwrite the cost of a significant portion of newly constructed or renovated facilities, as well as applicants that demonstrate innovative solutions and cost savings to meet safety and scientific requirements of facilities for basic, translational, and clinical research. The Committee also directs NIH to allocate no less than 25 percent of funding for this program to institutions that serve underrepresented and underprivileged populations and to in-stitutions in the geographical areas with deficits in research re-sources, access to advanced technologies, and health-related serv-ices to ensure geographic and institutional diversity. Black Men in Medicine and Science. \u2014The Committee supports the efforts of the National Academies Roundtable on Black Men and Black Women in Medicine to explore the factors that con-tribute to the low participation of Black men in the medical profes-sion. The Committee strongly encourages the Director to allocate resources to address the increasing underrepresentation of Black men in medical schools and in the biomedical research profession. In addition, the Committee recognizes the need to increase the number of biomedical research professionals as leaders in critical areas of national need. The Committee strongly encourages NIH to establish a scholarship program that encourages African American students to pursue a career in medicine, science, and biomedical re-search to combat the persistent decline of Black male physicians over the last decade. Biorepository Catalog. \u2014The Committee is encouraged by efforts within the biomedical research community to better understand chronic diseases through biorepositories which store medical tis-sues and associated information for scientific research. Increasing awareness and utilization of these biorepositories by the wider medical community would be highly useful to science, medicine, and national security. The Committee encourages NIH to partner with one or more research institutions to implement innovative ap-proaches for improving the discoverability and utility of bioreposi-tories for tissues and associated data for cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer and diabetes. The Committee encourages NIH, along with the sponsoring research institution or institutions, to establish protocols for the release of tissues and as-sociated data from such biorepositories. Brain and Body Health. \u2014The Committee encourages partnership and collaboration with entities able to explore the similarities in the brains and comorbid conditions of those with Alzheimer's dis-ease, dementia, and autism, to facilitate studies related to brain and body health, including studies designed to improve and empiri-cally validate a variety of supports for complex conditions. Centers for Polysubstance Use Research. \u2014The Committee is pleased that NIH supports research on alcohol/polysubstance use and encourages the Director to increase research in this area through additional comprehensive centers across the U.S. Given the increasing prevalence of polysubstance deaths, particularly among rural and minority communities, the Committee also en-courages the Director to focus one or more centers on rural and mi- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul with high rates of alcohol and polysubstance use mortality. Childhood Post-Infectious Autoimmune Disorders. \u2014The Com- mittee continues to be concerned that children, following strepto-coccal and other infections, are experiencing the onset of neuropsychiatric and behavioral disorders. These auto-inflam-matory encephalopathic conditions, including Pediatric Auto-immune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections (PANDAS) and Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS), are often misdiagnosed. Delays in diagnosis and lack of developed avenues of treatment result in a devastating es-calation of mental health symptoms and associated costs. The Com-mittee encourages NIH to explore cross-disciplinary research in this area, including neurobiology, neurology, immunology, infec-tious disease, and mental health, and report to the Committee in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justification on the under-standing of the incidence, causes, diagnostic criteria, and treatment of these conditions. Clinical Trials During the COVID-19 Pandemic. \u2014The Com- mittee appreciates the accommodations NIH has made for clinical trial sites so that institutions can continue to safely conduct clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Committee encourages the Director to make investments in research at trial sites to study the impacts of these flexibilities on trial participants, providers, and the overall integrity of the research, and to determine similar adaptations that could be made to improve accessibility of trials, especially for those with historically low participation rates (e.g., racial and ethnic minorities, rural residents, adolescent and young adults, and older adults). Common Fund. \u2014The Committee recommends $631,899,000 for the Common Fund (CF), and an additional $12,600,000 provided to support the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act for the sev-enth year of the ten-year Pediatric Research Initiative. This is $5,388,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $48,032,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Community-Based Participation Initiative for Tick-Borne Dis- eases. \u2014The Committee recognizes that community-based physi- cians, advocates, and patients are potential resources who can add value to a broad range of NIH's tick-borne disease (TBD) activities as they are in other diseases, such as HIV. The Committee encour-ages NIH to establish a Community-Based Participation (CBP) ini-tiative for TBD and to identify community-based resources\u2014data and people\u2014to evaluate how community-based perspectives can add significant value lo and be incorporated into the broad range of TBD activities, such as strategic planning, research portfolio de-sign, programs, special Initiatives, grant proposals and peer re-view. Diversity at NIH Working Group and Strategic Plan. \u2014While the Committee is encouraged by the NIH's demonstrated commitment to diversity, the Committee remains concerned about the continued lack of diversity at NIH among staff and grantees. Accordingly, the Committee requests, within 180 days of enactment of this Act, a strategic plan with long-term and short-term goals to address the racial, ethnic, and gender disparities at NIH. Given recent research in funding gaps at NIH, the Committee requests that this strategic VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, plan identifies barriers in access to NIH funding by investigators researching health disparities, as well as corrective solutions that can be implemented at NIH. The Committee encourages NIH to es-tablish a working group to support development and implementa-tion of this plan, which should be comprised of, but is not limited to, the NIH Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion; Institute and Center Directors and their designees; extramural grantees; experts working in diversity and inclusion; and other community stake-holders. The Committee requests a report from the NIH within 90 days of enactment of this Act that includes detailed information about the composition of the NIH workforce, advisory committees, and grantees over the last five fiscal years. The data should include disaggregated race and ethnicity data, gender, disability status, and veteran status. For grantees and advisory committee members, the data should also include data on the institution of terminal de-gree and undergraduate institution. Diversity in Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trials. \u2014The Committee appreciates NIH taking actions to address under-representation of minority populations in Alzheimer's disease and dementia clinical trials. To build upon this work, the Committee directs the Director, in concert with NIA and NIMHD, to examine the language accessi-bility of its Alzheimer's disease clinical trials and report back on opportunities to strengthen access to clinical research for volun-teers who are not fluent in English. Further, the Committee directs NIH to enhance the functionality of ClincalTrials.gov to include ways to more easily identify trials that accept participants in dif-ferent languages. The Committee requests a project plan and timeline for implementing these changes within 180 days of enact-ment of this Act. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Research Models. \u2014In recent years, more Duchenne drug trials have failed than succeeded de-spite promising results from pre-clinical animal models. These re-sults lead to years of inefficient drug development and few ap-proved treatments. The Committee urges NIH to convene a multi- stakeholder workshop to evaluate pre-clinical animal models used frequently in muscular dystrophy treatment research, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and to consider whether alternative models or strategies may improve therapy development outcomes. Eating Disorder Research. \u2014The Committee commends NIH for supporting multi-Institute research on the chronic, fatal, and seri-ous mental illnesses encompassing eating disorders that affect 30 million Americans during their lifetimes, and its association with other conditions such as diabetes, infertility, heart disease, PTSD, substance use, co-morbid mental illnesses, and tooth decay. The Committee recognizes that eating disorders are a deadly bio-psy-cho-social illness and that multiple research topics must be ex-plored to understand, prevent, and treat eating disorders, including psychosocial issues; health disparities and food insecurity; environ-mental factors such as weight stigma; the complex interplay of metabolic processes; and maternal health. The Committee encour-ages NIH to increase support for eating disorders research and ex-plore these and other research questions through multiple Insti-tutes and Centers, including NIMH, NIDDK, NIMHD, and NIDA. The Committee directs NIH to inform the Committee on the steps VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, taken to increase support for eating disorders and measures taken to improve prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of eating disorders in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justification. E-Cigarette Research. \u2014The Committee encourages NIH to prioritize research into the understanding of the biological changes that occur due to use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) among adolescents. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. \u2014The Committee encourages NIH to support research and activities with respect to Ehlers-Danlos Syn-drome and related connective tissue disorders. Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) .\u2014 The Committee includes no less than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level for the ECHO Project, which has the potential to greatly in-crease understanding of these critical determinants of health across the lifespan, through its observational cohorts and the IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network. The Committee encourages con-tinued communication about the program's progress toward goals, milestones, and projected funding estimates with both external stakeholders and Congress. Federal Advisory Committees Transparency Initiative. \u2014The Com- mittee recognizes that Federal advisory committees established as part NIH pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 282(b)(6) fill an important role in advising NIH on major decisions on plans and policies. However, to guarantee due process, it is vital that all NIH Federal advisory committees operate in a transparent way. As such, the Committee directs all NIH Federal advisory committees, including in par-ticular the Literature Selection Technical Review Committee (LSTRC), to make public their standards of review, decision-mak-ing methodologies, and processes by which to appeal a rec-ommendation. Moreover, the LSTRC and all other NIH Federal ad-visory committees shall ensure that they are operating in accord-ance with the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C., Appendix 2). Firearm Injury and Mortality Prevention Research. \u2014The Com- mittee includes $25,000,000 to support research on the prevention of gun violence, $12,500,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $25,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Research should focus on biological, behavioral, and environmental mechanisms that underlie aggression, as well as prevention of self- directed violence. The Committee recognizes that community gun violence, such as gang violence, constitutes a significant portion of gun homicides in the U.S. There is a disproportionate impact of community gun vio-lence on low-income communities of color, which is not often re-flected in the national narrative surrounding gun violence. The Committee encourages NIH to support research on community gun violence and to select grantees that reflect the diversity of the vic-tims of gun violence and that work in or near the impacted commu-nities. Fostering Department of Energy (DOE)-NIH Partnership for Radiopharmaceutical Production and Use. \u2014The Committee encour- ages NIH to explore novel applications for radiopharmaceuticals and leverage next-generation advanced manufacturing techniques for isotope production being made by DOE-funded research univer-sities and National Laboratories. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul X (FX). \u2014The Committee encourages NIH to expand the base of researchers and clinicians who are familiar with and trained in the Fragile X-associated disorders and promoting col-laboration between basic scientists and clinicians to enable re-searchers to better understand phenotypes, document variations in how the disorder presents itself, identify potential biomarkers and outcome measures, and develop new interventions. Gene-Environment Interactions in Neurodegenerative Disorders in Diverse Populations of African Americans and Latinos. \u2014In the con- text of NIH's robust neurological disease research portfolio, the Committee commends the leadership of NIH in advancing the rel-evant objectives of the 21st Century Cures Act and the BRAIN Ini-tiative. The Committee is concerned and recognizes the need to bet-ter understand the interactions between genetics and environ-mental factors, in particular with regard to elderly and diverse populations of African Americans and Latinos. The Committee en-courages NIH to accelerate collaborative research across relevant Institutes and Centers and the research community to address the goal of determining the role of the interaction between environ-mental exposures to toxic chemicals, other environmental stressors, and genetics and their impact on neurodegenerative disorders in di-verse populations of African Americans and Latinos, to allow for earlier diagnosis and subsequent treatment to arrest the progres-sion of these devastating neurodegenerative disorders. Harassment Policies. \u2014The Committee commends NIH for its on- going work focused on changing the culture of sexual harassment that is pervasive throughout its biomedical research laboratories. However, the Committee believes NIH must do more to play an ac-tive role in addressing sexual harassment and gender discrimina-tion, particularly in extramural research settings. For this reason, in the statement of managers accompanying the Consolidated Ap-propriations Act, 2020, the conferees directed ''NIH ''to require in-stitutions to notify the agency when key personnel named on an NIH grant award are removed because of sexual harassment con-cerns''. NIH took a major step toward implementing this direction in its June 11, 2020 clarification of its ''Guidance Regarding Change of Status, Including Absence of PD/PI and Other Key Per-sonnel Named in the Notice of Award'' (NOT-OD-20-124), but then fell short by not requiring its grantees to notify it when key personnel are removed for concerns of harassment. The Committee directs NIH to revise this guidance within 30 days of enactment of this Act to make clear that grantees must identify any changes to key personnel on an award that are related to concerns about har-assment. These new terms and conditions must also require the awardee to notify NIH if the Principal Investigator (PI) or co-PI is placed on administrative leave or if the awardee has imposed any administrative action on the PI or any co-PI relating to any find-ing, determination or infraction regarding codes of conduct, stat-utes, regulations, or executive orders related to sexual harassment, other forms of harassment, or sexual assault within ten business days from the date of the finding or determination or the date of the placement of a PI or co-PI by the awardee on administrative leave or the imposition of an administrative action. The Committee directs NIH, in coordination with the HHS Office for Civil Rights, to assess the feasibility of creating a pathway of communication VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, for individuals to report concerns of sex discrimina- tion occurring in NIH-funded extramural laboratories outside of the Title IX complaint process. The Committee directs NIH to develop written guidance specifying the types of reporting considered to be informal and possible ways information regarding concerns of sex discrimination, including sexual harassment, may be used. The Committee directs NIH to submit to the Committee, within 90 days of enactment of this Act, goals and a plan outlining the potential for this pathway and guidance and assessing the agency's sexual harassment prevention and intervention efforts for grantees, in-cluding methods to regularly monitor and evaluate sexual harass-ment prevention and intervention policies and communication mechanisms. Finally, the NIH Director is directed to provide semi-annual reports to the Committee detailing progress made toward these activities. Human Microbiome Project. \u2014The Committee is pleased with the developments made by the NIH's Human Microbiome Project and encourages relevant Institutes and Centers to spearhead new cross- disciplinary efforts in microbiome sciences. The Committee also en-courages collaborations with academia to develop knowledge and tools required to predict and control behavior of diverse microbiomes through multidisciplinary approaches. Humane Research Alternatives. \u2014Recognizing that humane, cost- effective, and scientifically suitable non-animal methods are avail-able but underutilized, the Committee requests that NIH assemble a panel to investigate and make recommendations regarding incen-tives for more quickly and effectively moving NIH intramural and external research away from methods that rely on animals to meth-ods that rely on non-animal alternatives. The panel should review and recommend means of encouraging greater reliance on existing humane and scientifically satisfactory non-animal methods. Panel membership should include individuals with proven knowledge of/ experience with non-animal research methods; with expertise in evaluating the adequacy of searches for non-animal methods de-scribed in research proposals; and with knowledge of the welfare concerns and scientific limitations of animal-based studies. The Committee asks that NIH provide a report of the panel's findings by June 2022. Impact of Racism on Public Health. \u2014Many local officials and health departments are declaring racism as a public health emer-gency. National organizations such as the American Medical Asso-ciation, the American College of Physicians, and the American Academy of Pediatrics have made similar statements decrying the impact of racism on health. Many studies have shown that rac-ism\u2014as expressed through implicit and explicit biases, institu-tional structures, and interpersonal relationships\u2014has a negative impact on the health of impacted communities. The Committee di-rects NIH to provide a report to the Committee within 90 days of enactment of this Act summarizing NIH's current portfolio of re-search on racism as a social determinant of health and outlining how NIH plans to expand and build upon this work. Increasing Diversity in Health Disparities Research. \u2014The Com- mittee recognizes that there is an urgent need to increase the rep-resentation of Hispanic patients, caregivers, clinicians and re-searchers in biomedical research, particularly in health disparities VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, Committee encourages NIH to develop a Junior Fac- ulty Research Accelerator program to support efforts related to sci-entific workforce diversity and help ensure better health outcomes and reduce health care disparities affecting the underrepresented communities, including the Hispanic community. Such a program should recruit junior researchers from medicine and public health from across the nation and match them with senior researchers ex-perienced with health disparities research. Participants should re-ceive one-on-one mentoring, onsite educational meetings at NIH, and access to other assistance and resources that place them on a research track relevant to underserved communities, public health, prevention, and social determinants of health. Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) Technology. \u2014The Com- mittee continues to stress iPSC technology as a critical tool in the realm of personalized medicine. The Committee notes that iPSCs are derived from adult skin cells, providing increased opportunities to develop sources of cells with immense therapeutic value and po-tential for curing human diseases. The Committee recognizes that basic science leads to pre-clinical trials, cures, diagnostics, and treatments and encourages NIH to further explore additional basic science opportunities. In addition, the Committee understands that collaborative consortiums such as the Southeast Stem Cell Consor-tium (SESCC) leverages research capabilities to further advance scientific knowledge in the area of iPSC basic research. The Com-mittee requests an update in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justification on NIH efforts to expand iPSC technology basic re-search through collaborative consortiums. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD). \u2014The Committee commends NIH for leading cross-Institute initiatives focused on nutrition, in-cluding a Strategic Plan for Nutrition Research and a precision nu-trition initiative within the NIH Common Fund. To advance these efforts with a focus on IBD and related chronic inflammatory auto-immune diseases, the Committee encourages NIH to work with multiple Institutes and Centers on current and emerging IBD dis-ease research priorities including the interactions among food, the gut, and the brain/nervous system in people with IBD and other chronic gastrointestinal diseases. Intramural Primate Research. \u2014The Committee remains con- cerned about NIH's intramural use of nonhuman primates in bio-medical research and continues to urge NIH to accelerate efforts to identify more efficient and effective alternatives to nonhuman pri-mate research. The Committee directs NIH to provide a report to the Committee no later than one year after enactment that outlines a plan to implement more efficient and effective alternatives to nonhuman primate research activities, describes how these alter-natives have reduced intramural research using nonhuman pri-mates by December 31, 2025, and outlines a plan for retirement of primates no longer needed in intramural research. Lyme and Other Tick-Borne Diseases. \u2014The Committee strongly encourages NIH to hold, within one year of enactment of this Act, a workshop on the numerous molecular and functional mechanisms that Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) employs to evade and subvert the immune system of the human host and the immune responses and consequences and also how these mechanisms and responses can subvert the effectiveness of antibiotics. The Committee supports in- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, TBD pathogens to consider shared and unique characteristics of the pathogens as NIH determines practical for the workshop, with participation by researchers who have pub-lished peer-reviewed articles describing such mechanisms and im-mune cell responses, particularly for Bb. Multiple, well-docu-mented, defense mechanisms of Bb should be evaluated and recog-nized as understanding these mechanisms and their significance underpins the ability to develop effective diagnostics and treat-ments. The Committee encourages NIH to continue research on early diagnosis and treatment of Lyme and other TBD to prevent the development of late stage disease and more serious and longer- term disability, but also intensify research on diagnosis and treat-ment of late stage and chronic disease. Priority should be based on disease burden and should be given to Lyme disease, which has a high public health burden in the U.S. and has a significant patient population who are not diagnosed until late stage when treatment is more difficult. Microbiome Research. \u2014The last decade has seen an explosion in microbiome data. The microbiome is now considered an unrealized source for drug targets and precision medicine, yet the nontradi-tional collaborations between leaders in microbial ecology, engi-neering, and medicine required for translation and innovation are currently lacking. Support for a centralized venue for experts from universities and the public and private sectors to partner, share and analyze data, and support bench-to-bedside-to-bench research is critical to enhancing our understanding of microbial relation-ships to human health and accelerate discovery. Mitochondrial Disorder Research and Coordination. \u2014The Com- mittee is aware that NIH has spearheaded a number of initiatives to identify new mitochondrial disorders, discover the linkages be-tween mitochondrial disorders, and translate advances in mitochondrial research to treatments, cures, and other medical interventions for mitochondrial disorders and their secondary dis-eases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cancer. The Committee is supportive of NIH's efforts through the formation of the North American Mitochondrial Disease Consortium (NAMDC) and its associated registry as well as coordination among Institutes and Centers to support the Mitochondrial Disease Se-quence Data Resource Consortium (MSeqDR), which serves as a ro-bust central repository for genomic sequencing data for mitochondrial disorders. Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS). \u2014MPS diseases are inherited, with death occurring for many in early childhood. This systematic dis-ease causes progressive damage to the bones, heart, respiratory system, and brain. The Committee continues to urge NIH, particu-larly NCATS and NINDS, to put a high priority on better under-standing and treating MPS and mucolipidosis diseases. The Com-mittee also commends NIH for allocating funds to discover, de-velop, define, and make available for research animal models of human genetic disease. The Committee encourages expanded re-search of treatments for neurological, inflammatory, cardio-vascular, and skeletal manifestations of MPS, with an emphasis on gene therapy. The Committee thanks NINDS, NIDDK, and ORDR for again funding the Lysosomal Disease Network (LDN) through the Rare Disease Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) and for VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul lysosomal research meetings. The Committee encourages the NIH to incentivize MPS research. Understanding the mani-festations and treatments of both the skeletal and neurological dis-ease continues to be the greatest areas of unmet needs. National Commission on Lymphatic Diseases. \u2014The Committee encourages NIH to work with relevant stakeholders to advance the establishment of a National Commission on Lymphatic Diseases that will make critical recommendations on coordinating NIH-wide lymphatic disease research. The Committee requests an update no later than 90 days after the enactment of this bill about specific next steps to establish the Commission. In addition, the Committee is concerned that not enough research is focused on lymphedema and requests a report within 120 days of enactment of this Act re-garding the annual support level for lymphatic research funding over the past five years, including the types of grants supported in the last five fiscal years. National Laboratories. \u2014NIH funding supports investments which are collaborative with the ongoing work of the DOE. The Committee directs NIH to update the committee on the work to co-ordinate its efforts with DOE and the National Laboratories, and in more strategic ways to leverage NIH's research needs in the next generation of cancer research, brain mapping, drug develop-ment or other emerging ideas in biomedical research that requires DOE's instrumentation, materials, modeling simulation, and data science. In 2015, the Secretary of Energy established the Energy Advisory Board (SEAB) to evaluate the prospects for increased col-laboration between DOE researchers and biomedical scientists sup-ported by other agencies, especially NIH. Increased and more effec-tive coordination could be instrumental to assist in the develop-ment of the Nation's health, security, novel biomedical tech-nologies, and in the development of more strategic enabling tech-nologies. The Committee supports NIH's collaboration with DOE and the National Laboratories in an effort to maximize utilization of DOE's capabilities, particularly for NIH's rapidly growing data and computational challenges. National Research Service Award (NRSA) Program. \u2014The Com- mittee encourages NIH to continue support for the Minority Bio-medical Research Support (MBRS), the Graduate Research Train-ing Initiative for Student Enhancement (G-RISE), and the Under-graduate Research Training Initiative for Student Enhancement (U-RISE) programs under the NRSA program. These programs aim to increase the participation of, and broaden opportunities for, underrepresented minority faculty, investigators, and students en-gaged in biomedical and behavioral research. Neurofibromatosis (NF). \u2014The Committee supports efforts to in- crease funding and resources for NF research and treatment at multiple Institutes, including NCI, NINDS, NIDCD, NHLBI, NICHD, NIMH, NCATS, and NEI. Children and adults with NF are at elevated risk for the development of many forms of cancer, as well as deafness, blindness, developmental delays and autism; the Committee encourages NCI to increase its NF research port-folio in fundamental laboratory science, patient-directed research, and clinical trials focused on NF-associated benign and malignant cancers. The Committee also encourages NCI to support clinical and preclinical trials consortia. Because NF can cause blindness, VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul hearing loss, the Committee urges NINDS, NEI, and NIDCD to continue to aggressively fund fundamental basic science research on NF relevant to restoring normal nerve function. Based on emerging findings from numerous researchers worldwide dem-onstrating that children with NF are at significant risk for autism, learning disabilities, motor delays, and attention deficits, the Com-mittee encourages NINDS, NIMH, and NICHD to increase their in-vestments in laboratory-based and patient-directed research inves-tigations in these areas. Since NF2 accounts for approximately 5 percent of genetic forms of deafness, the Committee encourages NIDCD to expand its investment in NF2-related research. NF can cause vision loss due to optic gliomas. The Committee encourages NEI to expand its investment in NF1-focused research on optic gliomas and vision restoration. NIH Chimp Retirements to Chimp Haven. \u2014The Committee is aware that NIH has a statutory duty under the CHIMP Act (42 U.S.C. 283m) to retire all surplus chimpanzees to the national sanctuary system, and NIH's stated plan to now keep the chim-panzees at Alamogordo Primate Facility (APF) instead of moving them to Chimp Haven goes against the intent of Congress. While NIH cites the health condition of the chimpanzees as a reason to warehouse them at APF, it is because of their health and long his-tory of laboratory use that makes it urgent they be provided an op-portunity to live the remainder of their lives in sanctuary, even if for a short period. This is not only a concern about chimp welfare, but also taxpayer spending. According to the most recent APF con-tract, it costs approximately $133 per day per chimpanzee to keep them at APF compared to $42 per chimpanzee per day at Chimp Haven. The APF costs will continue to increase as the population declines while Chimp Haven costs will decline as their population increases. Therefore, recognizing the best interests of both the chimps and taxpayer costs, the Committee strongly encourages the NIH to reconsider transport of all APF chimpanzees to Chimp Haven. Movement of government-owned and supported chimps from Southwest National Primate Research Center (SNPRC) and Keeling Center for Comparative Medicine and Research (KCCMR) should immediately follow transport of the APF chimpanzees to Chimp Haven. The Committee also directs NIH to provide updates to the Committee each quarter, beginning no later than December 31, 2020 that shall include: (1) the number of chimpanzees trans-ported to the national sanctuary over the last quarter; (2) a census of all government-owned and supported chimpanzees remaining, if any, at APF, SNPRC or KCCMR; and (3) a list of any chimpanzee deaths that have occurred at any time after January 1, 2020 at ei-ther APF, SNPRC or KCCMR. Office of AIDS Research. \u2014The Committee includes no less than $3,107,000,000 for HIV/AIDS research, an increase of $37,000,000 above the estimated fiscal year 2020 level. This investment builds on an increase of $31,000,000 included in fiscal year 2020, bringing the two-year increase for NIH's HIV/AIDS research to a total of $99 million. Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR). \u2014 OBSSR was established to coordinate and promote basic, clinical, and translational research in the behavioral and social sciences in support of the NIH mission. The Committee supports OBSSR's ac- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul aimed at strengthening these sciences by enhancing trans- NIH investments in longitudinal datasets, technology in support of behavior change, innovative research methodologies, and promoting the inclusion of behavioral and social sciences in initiatives at the NIH Institutes and Centers. In partnership with other Institutes and Centers, OBSSR co-funds highly rated grants that these Insti-tutions and Centers cannot fund alone, and coordinates NIH's high- priority program on gun violence prevention research. Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH). \u2014The Committee commends the ORWH on its efforts to ensure that NIH-supported research addresses issues that affect women, promote the inclusion of women in clinical research, and develop and expand opportuni-ties for women throughout the biomedical research career pipeline. The Committee is disappointed that funding for ORWH has lagged behind the total funding for NIH over the past several years. The Committee includes no less than $43,925,000, an increase of $5,000,000 above the estimated fiscal year 2020 funding level, for ORWH to expand its work in fiscal year 2021. Osteopathic Medical Schools .\u2014Osteopathic medical schools serve an important role in treating our nation's rural, underserved, and socioeconomically challenged populations. Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine, usually primary care clinicians, currently make up 11 percent of the active clinician workforce, and their numbers are projected to grow to 20 percent by 2030. In addition, currently 34 of America's 185 medical schools (18 percent) are Doctor of Osteo-pathic Medicine schools, and 26 percent of students entering med-ical school are osteopathic medical students. Historically, this group lacks access to research funding and is disproportionately underrepresented in NIH review panels. Currently, Doctor of Os-teopathic Medicine receive only 0.1 percent of NIH grants. Of the 3,233 grant reviewers on the 173 NIH standing study sections es-tablished to provide grant review for calendar year 2018, zero had Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine credentials. The Committee sup-ports efforts to ensure the full range of medical professionals are included in grant awards and grant review panels. Pediatric Research .\u2014The Committee requests an update from the Director within 120 days of enactment of this Act on how NIH will focus on the unique needs of children in its NIH-wide initiatives that span multiple Institutes and Centers, as well as its highest priority initiatives, including but not limited to the All of Us Re-search Program and the Cancer Moonshot. The Committee asks that with respect to these major NIH initiatives, this update de-scribe the inclusion of pediatric subjects, research relevant to pedi-atrics, specific funding allocations, support for pediatric physician scientists, and a strategy to more proportionally target funds with-in these initiatives to pediatric research. The Committee commends NIH for the establishment of the Trans-NIH Pediatric Research Consortium to help coordinate pediatric research at NIH. The Com-mittee also requests an update in the fiscal year 2022 Congres-sional Justification on the activities of the Consortium and its plans to better coordinate pediatric research across the institutes, including identifying gaps and opportunities for collaboration. Pelvic Floor Disorders .\u2014 The Committee recognizes that pelvic floor disorders, including such conditions as urinary incontinence, accidental bowel leakage, and pelvic organ prolapse, have a large VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul on individuals and society, and significant nega- tive quality of life impact for more than 25 million women annu-ally, in the U.S. alone. The Committee urges NICHD, NIDDK, and NIA to collaborate, on the development of universally accepted dis-order specific data sets for the purpose of research studies on pa-tient outcomes of current and future therapies used to treat pelvic floor disorders and the pathogenesis of these conditions. The Com-mittee requests that NICHD, NIDDK and NIA provide a report on current research and future initiatives to address pelvic floor dis-orders in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justification and pro-vide timely updates to the Committee on advances being made with respect to prevention, treatment and understanding the mecha-nisms of these conditions. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) .\u2014 The Committee recognizes the significant health burden of PCOS, the most common cause of female infertility. About 10 million women have PCOS, which has affected their reproductive, mental, and metabolic health and wellness. The Committee commends NICHD for its continued lead-ership in PCOS research. Over 70 percent of NIH's investment in PCOS research has focused on symptoms and comorbidities that impact women's reproductive health. Pregnant women with PCOS are more likely to develop preeclampsia (pregnancy-related hyper-tension) and have emergency C-sections. Given that the majority of NIH research on PCOS has focused on reproductive implications of the syndrome, critical gaps still exist in understanding the connec-tions between these severe comorbidities and PCOS. The Com-mittee encourages NIH to expand its PCOS research activities and programs to include research on comorbidities associated with PCOS, including liver disease, uterine cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and suicide. There-fore, the Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justification on current PCOS research activities on related comorbidities and existing research gaps, as well as oppor-tunities for trans-NIH research efforts to address PCOS and re-lated diseases. The Committee urges NIH to prioritize PCOS re-search funding for New and Early Stage Investigator Awards, and to encourage experienced biomedical and public health researchers to study PCOS and collaborate with patients to identify more effec-tive treatments and a possible cure for PCOS. Post-Research Adoption of Animals in Extramural Research .\u2014 The Committee commends NIH and other agencies for instituting policies and procedures to facilitate the placement of animals no longer needed for research with families or nonprofit shelters or sanctuaries. This is a far more humane and less wasteful practice than euthanizing otherwise healthy animals. The Committee notes, however, that the NIH policy covers only NIH intramural research. Animals used in NIH funded extramural research also should not be needlessly euthanized at the end of the experiment if they are determined to be healthy enough to be adopted or retired. The Committee encourages NIH to require grantees receiving extra-mural funds from NIH for research using animals to implement post research adoption policies that are at least as comprehensive as the NIH intramural policy. The committee requests that NIH provide a written update on this effort within one year of enact-ment of this Act. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul Maternal Mortality .\u2014 Preterm birth and its complications continue to be the leading cause of death for infants in the U.S. and around the world. The Committee is aware that the PREEMIE Reauthorization Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-328) enables the Secretary to establish an interagency working group to improve co-ordination of programs and activities within the Department to prevent preterm birth, infant mortality, and related adverse birth outcomes. The Committee requests a report within 60 days of en-actment of this Act regarding NIH's activities to create the inter-agency workgroup and its activities to-date to accomplish the du-ties outlined in the PREEMIE Act. In addition, the Committee rec-ognizes the disparities in outcomes by race, ethnicity, geography and income related to maternal mortality and prematurity and ap-preciates the work of many agencies in addressing these dispari-ties. The Committee directs the Interagency Workgroup to develop a coordinated Department-wide strategy and implementation plan to share learnings and identify and address factors that lead to ma-ternal mortality and prematurity, including those socio-economic and racial-ethnic factors contributing to disparities in outcomes and inequities in health care. Within one year of the enactment of this Act, the Committee directs NIH to submit a report to the Com-mittee on the aforementioned strategy and a plan for implementa-tion. Rare Disease Research .\u2014The Committee is aware that nearly one in ten individuals in the U.S. is affected by a rare disease, and that rare diseases frequently are genetic or have a genetic component. The Committee urges NIH to expand research on rare genetic and chromosomal abnormalities, such as 7q11.23 Duplication Syndrome and Hereditary Spastic Paraparesis 49 (TECPR2). Sex Differences and the COVID-19 Pandemic .\u2014Successfully con- fronting and mitigating the ongoing coronavirus pandemic requires scientific rigor and reproducibility in studies that benefit both women and men. Extensive prior research has revealed significant differences in the immune systems of women and men that affect health outcomes. This knowledge, coupled with evidence that men are likely to suffer more severe cases and die of COVID-19 than women, has led to research uncovering that immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 differ between women and men, and the nature of the response seen more frequently in men is what is likely to account for heightened disease susceptibility. The Committee strongly en-courages NIH to consider sex differences in its research on COVID- 19 to ensure that the benefits of this research will be applicable to men and women. Spina Bifida .\u2014The Committee encourages NIA, NIDDK, NICHD, and NINDS to study the causes and care of neurogenic bladder and kidney disease to improve the quality of life of children and adults with spina bifida; to support research to address issues related to the treatment and management of spina bifida and asso-ciated secondary conditions, such as hydrocephalus and sudden death in the adult spina bifida population; and to invest in under-standing the myriad co-morbid conditions experienced by individ-uals with spina bifida, including those associated with both paral-ysis and developmental delay; and to provide an update on re-search findings related to spina bifida in the fiscal year 2022 Con-gressional Justification. The Committee supports the specific ef- VerDate Sep 11 2014 05:16 Jul to understand early human development; set the foundation for healthy pregnancy, and lifelong wellness of women and children; and promote the gynecological, andrological and re-productive health for people with spina bifida. In addition, the Committee encourages NICHD to identify sensitive time periods to optimize health interventions; improve health during transition from adolescence to adulthood; and ensure safe and effective thera-peutics and devices for adults as well as children. Strengthening Maternal Health Coordination .\u2014The Committee is concerned with the rising rate of maternal mortality and morbidity in the U.S., especially in communities of color. The Committee sup-ports the activities of the trans-NIH Maternal Health Working Group, and its new Implementing a Maternal Health and Preg-nancy Outcomes Vision for Everyone (IMPROVE) Initiative. The Committee urges the working group to share results from IM-PROVE, including the research, knowledge, and best practices to State and local governments, health organizations, and private en-tities, to assist with efforts to combat the growing trend. The Com-mittee directs the working group to submit a report outlining ac-tions taken within one year of enactment of this Act. Timely Evaluation of Promising Biomedical Research Pro- posals .\u2014The Committee is concerned that the review process for certain research proposals is delaying promising biomedical re-search. The Committee directs NIH to ensure that any research proposal reviewed by an Ethics Advisory Board described by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 289a-1 is evaluated within the same timeframe as re-search proposals not subject to review by an Ethics Advisory Board. Tobacco Regulatory Science Program .\u2014The Committee supports the Tobacco Regulatory Science Program and encourages increased research to inform the FDA in regulation of the manufacture, mar-keting, and distribution of tobacco products to reduce the public health toll from tobacco product use in the U.S. The Committee en-courages NIH to increase support for research into the under-standing of nicotine addiction and to spur the development of bet-ter prevention and treatment strategies. Of particular importance are funding for research for effective interventions to help youth and young adults to quit vaping, and the interrelationship between the vaping of tobacco and marijuana. Trisomy 21 .\u2014The Committee commends NIH for its continuing support of the Investigating Co-Occurring Conditions Across the Lifespan to Understand Down Syndrome (INCLUDE) Initiative. The Committee includes no less than $65,000,000, an increase of $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 level, within the Office of the Director for the INCLUDE Initiative. The Committee expects that this multi-year, trans-NIH research initiative may advance sci-entific discoveries that will dramatically improve the health and quality of life of individuals with Down syndrome as well as mil-lions of typical individuals. The Committee requests the Director provide a plan within 60 days of enactment of this Act that in-cludes a timeline description of potential grant opportunities and deadlines for all expected funding opportunities so that young in-vestigators and new research institutions may be further encour-aged to explore research in this space. This plan should also incor-porate and increase pipeline research initiatives specific to Down syndrome. VerDate Sep 11 2014 05:16 Jul 08, Network (UDN) .\u2014The Committee urges the UDN to continue efforts to enhance access to patients, care-givers, and other stakeholders as well as make information ob-tained through the UDN available to Federal agencies and health- related agencies. Use of Human Fetal Tissue in Research .\u2014The Committee directs NIH to submit a report to the Committee within 180 days of enact-ment of this Act on the number and type of research proposals on cancer, eye diseases and disorders, HIV/AIDS, infectious diseases, neurological diseases and disorders, birth defects and develop-mental conditions, and other research topics that have been halted or delayed as a result of the new policy on research using human fetal tissue, as well as the goals and potential significance of the proposed research. Women's Health Research Priorities .\u2014The Committee is con- cerned that funding for women's health research specifically related to gynecology and obstetrics remains disproportionately lower than other areas of research at NIH. The Committee believes that more focus on this research would help to address the rising maternal morbidity and mortality rates; rising rates of chronic debilitating conditions in women; and stagnant cervical cancer survival rates. The Committee encourages NIH to convene a consensus conference within six months of enactment of this Act to include representa-tives from the Office of Research on Women's Health, NICHD, NCI, NHLBI, and NIDDK, as well as any other relevant NIH Institutes and Centers, and researchers, clinicians, women s health advocates and other relevant public stakeholders, to evaluate research cur-rently underway related to women's health. As part of the con-sensus conference, the Committee directs NIH to provide an update in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justification that identifies priority areas for additional study to advance women's health re-search, including reproductive sciences.

In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $425,000,000 for SAMHSA to support mental health and substance use disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administra- tion (SAMHSA) is the agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that leads public health efforts to ad-vance the behavioral health of the nation. SAMHSA's mission is to reduce the impact of substance abuse and mental illness on Amer-ica's communities. The Committee continues to include bill language that exempts the Mental Health Block Grant and the Substance Abuse Preven-tion and Treatment Block Grant as a source for the Public Health Service Act section 241 evaluation set-aside in fiscal year 2021.

The Com-mittee recognizes that there is a tremendous need for increasing access to coordinated, comprehensive care services that utilize the full range of FDA-approved medications and evidence-based treat-ments. These long-term care and support services dramatically im-prove outcomes for individuals and generate meaningful outcomes data to contribute to best practices for substance use disorders. The Committee directs SAMHSA to make the funding opportunity available to all eligible entities, as defined in section 7121, that meet this criterion. Criminal and Juvenile Justice Programs .\u2014The Committee in- cludes funding to address some of the unmet need for effective be-havioral health services and supports that are accessible before, during, and after incarceration and continue in the community for those with a mental disorder. The Committee recognizes the impor-tance of providing comprehensive services to those who suffer from severe mental health issues. The Committee is aware that there can be a correlation between mental health disturbances and re-peat criminal offenders. Therefore, the Committee strongly encour-ages SAMHSA's Criminal Justice Activities to prioritize funding for centers that provide assistance to those with severe mental health needs who are at risk of recidivism. These mental health centers can provide, but are not limited to, the following services: crisis care, residential treatment, outpatient mental health and primary care services, and community re-entry supports. The Committee strongly encourages SAMHSA to prioritize applications from areas with high rates of uninsured individuals, poverty, and substance use disorders. Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health .\u2014The Committee supports access to a range of evidence-based and culturally-appro-priate infant and early childhood mental health services, and to aid in addressing the national shortage of mental health professionals with infant and early childhood expertise. The Committee recog-nizes the importance of building mental health services for children under age six. These young children can and do experience mental health disturbances, yet their unique needs, particularly for infants and toddlers, are often overlooked in mental health policy and healthcare delivery systems. These grants help fill that gap by in-vesting in early mental health prevention, identification, and treat- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul ment, in order to reduce the need for treatment later in life when it becomes more difficult, time intensive, and expensive. Minority Fellowship Program .\u2014The Committee includes an in- crease of $1,000,000 in order to improve prevention, wellness, and treatment across the lifespan. As Congress seeks to better address substance abuse and mental health disorders across all popu-lations, the Committee recognizes the critical importance of sup-porting a diverse behavioral health workforce and its effectiveness in addressing substance use disorders and mental health issues im-pacting minority and underserved populations. Now is the Time .\u2014To increase access to mental health services, as set out by the 2013 ''Now is the Time'' plan, the Committee in-cludes an increase of $5,000,000 for Project AWARE, which is de-signed to identify children and youth in need of mental health serv-ices, to increase access to mental health treatment, and promote mental health literacy among teachers and school personnel. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to sustain and strengthen its grant and other programs that support school-based and campus- based services aimed at preventing and treating mental health challenges experienced by younger Americans. In addition, the Committee supports the Healthy Transitions program, which pro-vides grants to states and tribes to improve access to mental dis-order treatment and related support services for young people aged 16 to 25 who either have, or at risk of developing a serious mental health condition. Primary and Behavioral Health Care Integration .\u2014The Com- mittee includes an increase of $5,000,000 to fund a learning col-laborative for interested health care systems on effective integra-tion of nationally certified peer support specialists, with an empha-sis on health care systems in alternative payment models. PTSD in First Responders .\u2014The Committee is aware of research indicating that individuals working in the civilian first responder disciplines of law enforcement, fire services, and emergency med-ical services are at greater risk for full or partial post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than most other occupations because their responsibilities routinely entail confrontation with traumatic stressors. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to examine PTSD among this population, including prevalence rate, risk factors, symptom presentation, course, comorbidities, and rates of suicidal thoughts and actions. Suicide Prevention .\u2014The Committee recognizes the rising rate of suicide and notes that family and friends are often in the best posi-tion to recognize the warning signs of suicide and to help an at- risk individual get treatment. The Committee urges SAMHSA to develop and disseminate programs to provide specialized training and resources on identifying and responding to people at risk of suicide for families and friends of at-risk individuals. The Com-mittee includes an increase of $5,000,000 for the implementation the Zero Suicide model, a comprehensive, multi-setting approach to suicide prevention in health care systems. The Committee includes an increase of $2,000,000 and recognizes the importance of the Sui-cide Lifeline to provide rapid access at any time of the day or night to crisis intervention, and when needed, emergency response. The Committee is concerned by recent data from CDC and the National Survey on Drug Use and Health indicating a significant rise in VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, suicide reported over the last decade. The Committee encour- ages that SAMHSA, in consultation with the U.S. Department of Education, to develop a standard for providing all school-based teachers and nurses with suicide prevention training to treat men-tal health challenges experienced by younger Americans. In House Report 116-62, the Committee urged SAMHSA to provide specific training programs for Suicide Lifeline counselors to increase com-petency in serving LGBTQ youth through the utilization of existing specialized resources. The Committee also urged SAMHSA to con-sider the diversion of calls to specialty partners who are best situ-ated to serve the LGBTQ community. As the Lifeline continues to anticipate higher call volume, both due to mental health stresses caused by COVID-19 and the potential transition to a three digit code, it is now more important than ever that SAMHSA work to implement LGBTQ competency training for counselors and an Inte-grated Voice Response option for LGBTQ youth callers. Teacher and Educator Mental Health .\u2014The Committee finds there has been a lack of specific resources designed to address teacher and educator mental health. The Committee finds our edu-cators and teachers need additional resources to address mental health issues that arise due to their work. Educators are dealing with larger classrooms, fewer student resources, challenging social and societal problems, all of which have negative impacts on men-tal health, job satisfaction, family and home life, and ability to con-tinue to teach effectively. Tribal Behavioral Grants .\u2014The Committee includes an increase of $2,000,000 to expand efforts to address the high incidence of substance abuse and suicide among American Indian/Alaska Native populations. Mental Health Block Grant The Committee includes a total of $757,571,000, an increase of $35,000,000, for the Mental Health Block Grant. The block grant provides funds to States to support mental illness prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation services. Funds are allocated accord-ing to a statutory formula among the States that have submitted approved annual plans. The Committee continues the ten percent set-aside within the Mental Health Block Grant total for evidence-based programs that address the needs of individuals with early serious mental illness, including psychotic disorders. The Committee expects SAMHSA to continue its collaboration with the National Institute of Mental Health to encourage States to use this block grant funding to sup-port programs that demonstrate strong evidence of effectiveness. Furthermore, the Committee directs a new five percent set-aside of the total for evidence-based crisis care programs addressing the needs of individuals with serious mental illnesses and children with serious mental and emotional disturbances. The Committee directs SAMHSA to use the set-aside to fund, at the discretion of eligible States and Territories, some or all of a set of core crisis care elements including: centrally deployed 24/7 mobile crisis units, short-term residential crisis stabilization beds, evidence-based pro-tocols for delivering services to individuals with suicide risk, and regional or State-wide crisis call centers coordinating in real time. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, Disparities .\u2014The Committee believes that address- ing health care disparities experienced by racial and ethnic minori-ties should be a priority in programs funded by Federal agencies, including programs funded in whole or part by the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant authorized under 42 U.S.C. 300x-1. The Committee directs SAMHSA to require, in the report-ing mandated of states receiving the Mental Health Block Grant under 42 U.S.C. 300x-1, that State Mental Health Agencies report on services provided to individuals from racial and ethnic minori-ties, including the extent to which those services are provided to individuals from racial and ethnic minorities and the outcomes ex-perienced by individuals from racial and ethnic minorities as a re-sult of those services being provided. SAMHSA shall direct that im-pact and outcomes be reported for racial and ethnic minority adults with serious mental illness and racial and ethnic minority children with serious emotional disturbance in reports of data submitted re-lating to systems of care, diversions from hospitalization and crimi-nal justice system involvement, treatment for first episode psy-chosis, reductions in suicide and treatment for suicidal ideation, re-sponse through crisis services, and treatment of homeless individ-uals and individuals residing in rural communities. State Mental Health Agencies shall also report on outreach to, and the hiring of, racial and ethnic minority providers of mental health services. National Child Traumatic Stress Initiative The Committee includes $71,887,000 for the National Child Traumatic Stress Initiative. The Committee strongly supports the National Child Traumatic Stress Network for building, evaluating, disseminating, and delivering evidence-based services and best practices, including through universities, hospitals, and front-line providers, to prevent and mitigate the impact of exposure to trau-ma among children and families. For the new grant cycle, the Com-mittee provides an additional $3,000,000 for awards to promote the collaboration between academic researchers, mental health clini-cians, and front-line service providers. Of the total amount, $8,000,000 is designated for the National Center for Child Trau-matic Stress coordinating center cooperative agreement. The Com-mittee also directs SAMHSA to ensure that the network maintains its focus on collaboration, data collection, and the provision of di-rect services and that new grants should not be awarded as train-ing only. Child Victims of Disaster .\u2014The Committee recognizes the ongo- ing threat to mental health posed to our nation's children and fami-lies as a result of increasing frequency and intensity of natural and manmade technological disasters. Children who experience trau-matic stress may struggle with a wide range of childhood develop-mental capabilities, including social and educational functioning, and are at higher risk of later adverse physical, mental, and behav-ioral health outcomes if not recognized and addressed at an early stage. For this reason, the Committee strongly encourages that funding for the National Child Traumatic Stress Network be used to address child trauma as a result of natural and technological manmade disasters. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, The Committee includes $125,000,000 for the Children's Mental Health program. This program supports grants and technical as-sistance for community-based services for children and adolescents with serious emotional, behavioral, or mental disorders, and assists States and local jurisdictions in developing integrated systems of community care. Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness The Committee includes $64,635,000 for the Projects for Assist- ance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH) program. The PATH program supports grants to States and territories for assistance to individuals suffering from severe mental illness and/or substance abuse disorders and who are homeless or at imminent risk of be-coming homeless. Grants may be used for outreach, screening and diagnostic treatment services, rehabilitation services, community mental health services, alcohol or drug treatment services, train-ing, case management services, supportive and supervisory services in residential settings, and a limited set of housing services. Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness The Committee includes $36,146,000 for the Protection and Ad- vocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness program. This program serves to ensure that the rights of mentally ill individuals are pro-tected while they are patients in all public and private facilities or while they are living in the community. Funds are allocated to States according to a formula based on population and relative per capita incomes. Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics The Committee includes $225,000,000, an increase of $25,000,000 to provide grants to continue the improvement of mental disorder treatment, services, and interventions for children and adults, in-cluding the use of long-acting injectable medications approved for the treatment of serious mental illness and assistance to those with severe mental health needs who are at risk of recidivism. These mental health centers can provide, but are not limited to, the fol-lowing services: crisis care, residential treatment, outpatient men-tal health and primary care services, and community re-entry sup-ports. In addition, the CARES Act included $250,000,000 to support Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics. Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics Expansion .\u2014The Committee is pleased that the Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHC) program is expanding access to mental health and addiction treatment services and significantly reducing hospital emergency room utilization while assisting local law en-forcement agencies nationwide. Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics .\u2014The Committee directs SAMHSA to prioritize resources to entities within States that are part of section 223(a) of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-93) demonstration and to entities within States that were awarded planning grants. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, TREATMENT Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $3,837,756,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 3,807,756,000 ............................................................. 3,847,756,000 Change from +10,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +40,000,000 State Opioid Response Grants The Committee includes $1,500,000,000 for the State Opioid Re- sponse Grants (SOR). Area Health Education Centers .\u2014The Committee recognizes the effectiveness of Area Health Education Centers (AHEC) statewide networks and commends their interdisciplinary traineeship of health professionals who will treat opioid use disorder (OUD). Given the reach of the AHEC network to 85 percent of all counties in the U.S., including the District of Columbia, SOR grantees may choose to work collaboratively with AHECs for the development and implementation of statewide OUD continuing education, train-ing, and response activities. State Opioid Response Grants .\u2014The Committee is concerned longstanding guidance to the Department to avoid a significant cliff between States with similar mortality rates was overlooked in the award of fiscal year 2020 funds. For future awards, the Committee directs the Assistant Secretary to award funds to address funding cliffs between States with similar mortality rates. Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant The Committee includes a program level of $1,858,079,000 for the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant pro-vide funding to States to support alcohol and drug abuse preven-tion, treatment, and rehabilitation services. The Committee recog-nizes the critical role the block grant plays in State systems across the country. Within the total provided for Programs of Regional and National Significance, the Committee recommends the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2021 Committee Capacity: Opioid Treatment Programs and Regulatory Activities ......................................................................... $8, 724,000 Screening, Brief Intervention, Referral to Treatment ........................................................................... ......................................................................................... .... 1,000,000 Building Communities of Recovery ............................................................................................... ........ 10,000,000 Peer Support Technical Assistance Center ....................................................................................... .... 1,000,000 Emergency Department Alternatives to Opioids ................................................................................... Recovery, and Workforce Support ..................................................................................... .. Sep 11 2014 ......................................................................................................... Addiction 9,046,000 Minority Fellowship Program .................................................................................................... ............. 5,789,000 Building Communities of Recovery .\u2014The Committee includes an increase of $2,000,000 for enhanced long-term recovery support principally governed by people in recovery from substance use dis-orders. Such support reflects the community being served and en-courages the role of recovery coaches. SAMHSA is encouraged to ensure that grants employing peers comply with the highest stand-ards within their respective States. Criminal Justice Activities .\u2014The Committee provides $89,000,000 for the Criminal Justice Activities program. Of this amount, the Committee directs that not less than $70,000,000 will be used exclusively for Drug Court activities. The Committee con-tinues to direct SAMHSA to ensure that all funding appropriated for Drug Treatment Courts is allocated to serve people diagnosed with a substance use disorder as their primary condition. The Com-mittee directs SAMHSA to ensure that all drug treatment court grant recipients work directly with the corresponding State sub-stance abuse agency in the planning, implementation, and evalua- tion of the grant. The Committee further directs SAMHSA to ex-pand training and technical assistance to drug treatment court grant recipients to ensure evidence-based practices are fully imple-mented. Grants to Prevent Prescription Drug/Opioid Overdose and First Responder Training .\u2014The Committee notes strong concerns about the increasing number of unintentional overdose deaths attrib-utable to prescription and nonprescription opioids. SAMHSA is urged to take steps to encourage and support the use of Substance Abuse and Prevention Block Grant funds for opioid safety edu-cation and training, including initiatives that improve access for li-censed healthcare professionals, including paramedics, to emer-gency devices used to rapidly reverse the effects of opioid overdoses. Such initiatives should incorporate robust evidence- based intervention training and facilitate linkage to treatment and recovery services. Minority Fellowship Program .\u2014The Committee includes an in- crease of $1,000,000 in order to improve prevention, wellness, and treatment across the lifespan. As Congress seeks to better address substance abuse and mental health disorders across all popu-lations, the Committee recognizes the critical importance of sup-porting a diverse behavioral health workforce and its effectiveness in addressing substance use disorders and mental health issues im-pacting minority and underserved populations. Opioid Response Grants .\u2014The Committee includes $3,000,000 for supplemental grants to States whose award from the State Opioid Response formula grant declined by more than 40 percent in fiscal year 2020 in comparison to fiscal year 2019. The Committee directs SAMHSA to allocate the funds to eligible States within 30 days of enactment of this Act. Pregnant and Postpartum Women .\u2014The Committee recognizes SAMHSA for its work managing the Pregnant and Postpartum VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul which utilizes a family-centered approach to pro- vide comprehensive residential substance use disorder treatment services for pregnant and postpartum women, their minor children and for other family members. A provision in the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) authorized SAMHSA to allo-cate a portion of these resources for a pilot program to State alco-hol and drug agencies to support outpatient, intensive outpatient and related services in a family-centered approach. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to fund an additional cohort of States above and beyond those pilots already funded. Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment .\u2014 The Committee understands that substance use disorders, including opioid use, typically begin in adolescence, and that preventing un-derage drinking and other early substance use is a cost-effective strategy in preventing costly problems later in life. The Committee is also aware that Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) has been shown to be a cost-effective model for reducing and preventing underage drinking and other substance abuse, but that many health providers, especially pediatricians, have not been trained to use the method effectively. Therefore, the Committee directs $2,000,000 for implementing grants to pediatric health care providers in accordance with the specifications outlined in Section 9016 of P.L. 114-255, Sober Truth in Preventing Under-age Drinking Reauthorization. Training grants should focus on screening for underage drinking, opioid use, and other drug use, and be managed by CSAT within the existing SBIRT program. Targeted Capacity Expansion .\u2014The Committee includes an in- crease of $2,000,000 for grants to Indian tribes, tribal organiza-tions, or consortia. The Center for Substance Abuse Treatment is directed to include as an allowable use medication-assisted treat-ment and other clinically appropriate services to achieve and main-tain abstinence from all opioids and heroin and prioritize treatment regimens that are less susceptible to diversion for illicit purposes. Center for Substance Abuse Treatment Family Support Services for Addiction .\u2014The Committee recog- nizes the devastating impact the opioid epidemic has had on com-munities across the country. The Committee is also aware of the impact nonprofit family community organizations have had in pro-viding support for families of individuals struggling with substance use disorder, as well as their ability to mobilize resources within and outside of communities to provide a support network and peer to peer education. As many resources have been disbursed to state and local agencies, the Committee urges SAMHSA, in accordance with the Public Health Service Act, to ensure these family commu-nity organizations also have access to these funds to develop, ex-pand, and enhance their services for families of those struggling with substance use disorder. High Risk of Homelessness .\u2014The Committee encourages the prioritization of developing evidence-based programs and treat-ments specifically tailored for those with alcohol, illicit drugs, and prescription medications abuse and that are at high risk of becom-ing homeless. The science should inform local, state, and federal public health officials on successful treatment actions with low rates of recidivism. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul is concerned that relapse following opioid detoxification is a contributing factor to the overdose crisis. The Committee appreciates SAMHSA's ef-forts to address this within the federal grant population by empha-sizing that opioid detoxification should be followed by medication to prevent relapse to opioid dependence and encourages SAMHSA to disseminate and implement this policy in all settings where de-toxification is offered, including rehabilitation and criminal justice settings. Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome. \u2014The Committee recognizes the increase in maternal substance abuse and Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) and the health care costs associated with it. The Committee is aware of the need for more information regarding long-term health and developmental outcomes related to NAS, the wide variation in clinical practice and health systems support, as well as the challenges associated with post-discharge care. The Committee is aware of existing pilot programs that have effectively addressed the maternal and neonatal health needs of this popu-lation while lowering medical costs. Overdose Cases. \u2014The Committee is concerned that the rise in opioid overdoses among African American communities, especially urban cities, is not reflected enough in data summarizing opioid-re-lated deaths and overdoses. The Committee is aware of the growing demographic changes of opioid deaths and encourages efforts to re-verse this trend. Overdose Deaths Involving Stimulants. \u2014The Committee recog- nizes an increase in the rate of drug overdose deaths involving stimulants, including methamphetamine. The Committee is aware of proven existing pilot programs that have developed policies for effective drug prevention, treatment, and harm reduction. SAMHSA is encouraged to determine if such programs can be scaled to address this important issue. Point of Use Testing. \u2014The Committee encourages SAMHSA to allow eligible grantees to purchase and distribute point of use fentanyl testing strips and other testing methods in community set-tings. Prescription Opioids. \u2014The encourages SAMHSA, as part of its opioid prevention efforts, to provide clinicians with resources to adopt protocols to reduce the number of opioids prescribed to treat acute and urgent pain in this country. SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $206,469,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2020 ....................................................... 96,985,000 Committee Recommendation ............................................................. 209,469,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +3,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +112,484,000 Within the total provided for Programs of Regional and National Significance, the Committee provides the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2021 Committee Capacity: Strategic Committee Sober Truth on Preventing Underage Drinking .................................................................................... . 10,000,000 National Adult-Oriented Media Public Service Campaign ........................................................... 2,000,000 Community Based Coalition Enhancement Grants ...................................................................... 7,000,000 Interagency Coordinating Committee to Prevent Underage Drinking .......................................... 1,000,000 Tribal Behavioral Health Grants ................................................................................................ ........... 22,000,000 Science and Service: Center for the Application of Prevention Technologies ........................................................................ 7, 493,000 Science and Service Program Coordination ....................................................................................... ... 4,072,000 Minority Fellowship Program .................................................................................................... ............. 321,000 Sober Truth on Preventing Underage Drinking Act (STOP Act) .\u2014 The Committee includes an increase of $1,000,000 for the public health service campaign to strengthen efforts to reduce and prevent underage drinking. Tribal Behavioral Grants .\u2014The Committee includes an increase of $2,000,000 to expand efforts to address the high incidence of substance abuse and suicide among American Indian/Alaska Native populations. HEALTH SURVEILLANCE AND PROGRAM SUPPORT Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $160,258,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 139,457,000 Committee Recommendation ............................................................. 160,258,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... - - - Change from budget request ...................................................... +20,801,000 The Committee provides the following amounts for Health Sur- veillance and Program Support: Budget Activity FY 2021 ............................................................................................................ 30,428,000 Public Awareness and ................... 13,000,000 Performance and Quality Information Systems .................................................................................... ......... 10,000,000 Drug Abuse Warning Network ..................................................................................................... ................... 10,000,000 Behavioral Health Workforce .................................................................................................... ...................... 1,000,000 PHS Evaluation Funds ........................................................................................................................... 1,000,000 Clinical Training. \u2014The Committee recognizes the importance of clinical training experiences as a means of mitigating stigma to-wards patients with substance use disorders and encouraging stu-dents to specialize in behavioral health following graduation. The Committee directs SAMHSA to examine methods of facilitating in-creased clinical training opportunities for physician assistant and other graduate level health professions students, including through Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics and the agency's other existing grant opportunities. Collaboration with HUD .\u2014In the Fiscal Year 2020 Transpor- tation, and Housing and Urban Development Report 116-106, the Committee directed the Department of Housing and Urban Devel-opment to conduct a feasibility study with SAMHSA to understand how Section 8 vouchers could provide housing opportunities to those who seek SAMHSA supported services. The Committee is concerned over the slow effort to engage on this request. The Com-mittee expects this effort to proceed expeditiously and expects an update within 30 days of enactment of this Act. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, Data on Drug and Substance Abuse in the U.S. Territories. \u2014The Committee is concerned about the limited availability of data re-garding drug and substance abuse in Puerto Rico and the rest of the U.S. territories. In particular, the Committee is concerned that the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) does not include statistics from these jurisdictions. The Committee encour-ages SAMHSA to take all reasonable steps to include Puerto Rico and the rest of the territories in the NSDUH, in the same manner that data is collected and published for the 50 States and the Dis-trict of Columbia. A GENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $338,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... - - - Committee Recommendation ............................................................. 343,000,000 Change from enacted level ............................................................ +5,000,000 Change from budget request ......................................................... +343,000,000 The Committee includes $343,000,000 in program level funding for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). The total includes $143,091,000 in discretionary budget authority and $199,909,000 in PHS Act section 241 evaluation set-aside transfers. AHRQ's mission is to produce evidence to make health care safer, higher quality, more accessible, equitable, and affordable, and to work within HHS and with other partners to make sure that the evidence is understood and used. AHRQ conducts, supports, and disseminates scientific and policy-relevant research on topics such as promoting high-quality care, eliminating healthcare disparities, using information technology, and evaluating the effectiveness of clinical services. Within the total for AHRQ, the House includes the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2021 Committee Prevention/Care Safety Research ........................................................................................................ ......................... Research, Data, and Dissemination 97,484,000 Medical Expenditure ....................... 71,300,000 Antimicrobial Committee continues to provide no less than $10,000,000 for combating antibiotic-resistant bac-teria. Cardiovascular Clinical Outcomes .\u2014Heart disease is the leading cause of death for Americans. Understanding how to reduce the rate of cardiac events and to control the metabolic processes that lead to such events is needed. The Committee encourages AHRQ to conduct a study that assesses the current evidence for lipid con-trol and cardiovascular event reduction and quality measures for the improvement of clinical outcomes (e.g. coronary heart disease death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or urgent coronary revascularization procedure) and to report findings back to the Committee no later than 180 days after the enactment of this Act. AHRQ is also encouraged to develop and disseminate education re- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, sources and materials about improving cardiovascular clinical out- comes. Center for Primary Care Research. \u2014The Committee encourages AHRQ to consider establishing a Center for Primary Care Research to support clinical primary care research. The areas of focus could include strategies to improve primary care delivery, including through the use of clinical pharmacists and interprofessional; team based care; advancing the development of primary care research-ers; expanding research on persons with multiple co-morbid condi-tions; and improving primary care in rural and underserved areas, especially in remote and non-contiguous States. Infectious Disease Research. \u2014The Committee encourages AHRQ to fund diagnostics outcomes studies for infectious diseases, includ-ing those assessing patient outcomes, lengths of stay, changes in antibiotic use, rates of antibiotic use for certain patient popu-lations, and costs of care. The Committee encourages AHRQ to de-velop metrics to measure and track the effectiveness and outcomes of diagnostic interventions to improve clinical uptake, enhance stewardship efforts, and reduce the healthcare and economic bur-den of antimicrobial resistance in the U.S. as recommended by the Presidential Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria. Minimizing Racial Bias in Health Technology. \u2014The Committee is concerned that recent studies have demonstrated health tech-nologies exacerbated inequitable delivery of health services. Accord-ingly, the Committee encourages ARHQ to examine how racism and bias is built into algorithms, machine learning, and clinical de-cision support tools that impact patient outcomes and lead to dis-parities. The Committee requests a report within 120 days of the date of enactment of this Act from ARHQ that covers the extent of such bias in public health systems, as well as best practices health systems and public health stakeholders can take to address and minimize these biases in the use of algorithms, machine learn-ing, and clinical decision support tools. Partners Enabling Diagnostic Excellence. \u2014Within the Patient Safety portfolio, the Committee includes no less than $3,000,000, an increase of $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level, to support improving diagnosis in medicine. The Committee en-courages AHRQ to include a multiyear competitive grant program to address diagnostic errors, which may include the establishment of Research Centers of Diagnostic Excellence to develop systems, measures, and new technology solutions to improve diagnostic safe-ty and quality. Prenatal Care for Pregnant Individuals .\u2014The Committee recog- nizes the Department's ongoing efforts to address the pressing pub-lic health issue of rising maternal mortality. Research shows pre-natal care is a critical component of preventative care for pregnant individuals. The Committee includes no less than $500,000 for re-search that examines the potential cost-savings to the public health system of providing a special enrollment period for pregnant indi-viduals, as well as the impact of a special enrollment period on the private insurance market. Kratom. \u2014The Committee notes that little research has been done to date on natural products that are used by many to treat pain in place of opioids. These natural plants and substances in- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, (CBD). Given the wide availability and increased use of these substances, it is imperative to know more about potential risks or benefits, and whether or not they can have a role in finding new and effective non-opioid methods to treat pain. The Committee recommends $1,000,000 for this research, an increase of $500,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level, and encourages AHRQ to make center-based grants to address research which will lead to clinical trials in geographic regions which are among the hardest hit by the opioid crisis. Trafficking Awareness Training for Health Care. \u2014The Com- mittee encourages AHRQ to support activities authorized in the Trafficking Awareness Training for Health Care Act, including a pilot program for the creation, distribution, and evaluation of best practices for medical professionals to identify and respond to vic-tims of human trafficking. C ENTERS FORMEDICARE & M EDICAID SERVICES GRANTS TO STATES FOR MEDICAID Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ................................................. $273,188,478,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ............................................... 313,904,099,000 ..................................................... 313,904,099,000 Change from enacted level ................................................. +40,715,621,000 Change from budget request .............................................. - - - Medicaid provides health coverage to eligible populations, includ- ing eligible low-income adults, children, pregnant women, elderly adults, and people with disabilities. Medicaid is administered by States, according to Federal requirements. The program is funded jointly by States and the Federal government. This amount does not include $139,903,075,000, which was pro- vided as advance funding for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. In addition, the Committee recommends an advance appropriation of $148,732,315,000 for program costs in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. The Committee continues bill language providing indefinite budget authority for unanticipated costs in fiscal year 2021. Fed-eral Medicaid grants reimburse States for a portion of their ex-penditures in providing health care for individuals whose income and resources fall below specified levels. Subject to certain min-imum requirements, States are provided certain limited authority within the law to set eligibility, coverage, and payment levels. PAYMENTS TO THE HEALTH CARE TRUST FUNDS Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ................................................. $410,796,100,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ............................................... 439,514,000,000 ..................................................... 439,514,000,000 Change from enacted level ................................................. +28,717,900,000 Change from budget request .............................................. - - - This account includes the general fund subsidy to the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for Medicare Part B benefits, and Medicare drug benefits and administration, as well as other reimbursements to the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund for benefits and related to administrative costs, which have not been financed by payroll taxes or premium contributions.

PROGRAM MANAGEMENT Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ................................................. $3,669,744,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ............................................... 3,693,548,000 ..................................................... 3,984,744,000 Change from ................................................. +315,000,000 Change from budget request .............................................. +291,196,000 Research, Demonstration, and Evaluation The Committee includes $20,054,000 for Research, Demonstra- tion, and Evaluation, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 en-acted level and $20,054,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Program Operations The Committee includes $2,824,823,000 for Program Operations, which is $305,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $346,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 budget request. This office administers the programs under the Centers for Medi-care & Medicaid Services (CMS), funds beneficiary outreach and education, maintains information technology infrastructure needed to support various claims processing systems, and supports other programmatic improvements. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $200,000,000 for CMS activities, including not less than $100,000,000 for the survey and certification program, prioritizing nursing home facilities in localities with community transmission of coronavirus. Access to Rare Disease Treatments. \u2014The Committee understands that 1 in 10 Americans is impacted by a rare disease and that the Orphan Drug Act incentivizes the discovery of diagnostics and treatments that confirm prognosis, prolong life, and realize health system savings. Despite progress, treatments exist for only five per-cent of rare diseases. The Committee urges CMS to support access to biologic and gene therapies to address rare diseases. Addressing Obesity and Related Comorbidities. \u2014The Committee encourages CMS to provide access to the full continuum of care for obesity, including access to FDA-approved anti-obesity medications under Medicare Part D, if determined as clinically appropriate by the patient's physician, consistent with CMS's approach to pharmacotherapy agents used for weight gain to treat AIDS wast-ing and cachexia. Advanced Primary Care Model. \u2014The Committee encourages CMS to utilize data garnered from CMMI models in which phar-macists manage chronic diseases and medications and play an im-portant role in comprehensive medication management and transi-tions of care. The Committee recommends CMS test a model that incentivizes pharmacist involvement across relevant Medicare serv-ice lines, including in value-based models such as the Comprehen-sive Primary Care Plus (CPC+) primary care model. This advanced primary care model integrates pharmacists as part of the care team to provide medication management services, that include evalu-ating medication regimens, providing medication self-management VerDate Sep 11 2014 support for patients to help them adhere to their prescribed thera- pies, and promoting clinically-sound, cost-effective medication therapies. Adverse Childhood Experiences. \u2014The Committee is aware that childhood trauma and toxic stress have been linked to negative health outcomes through adulthood, including higher rates of dia-betes, stroke, depression, lapses in cognitive abilities, and develop-mental delays, suicide, and substance misuse, among others. Low- income children are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of ad-verse childhood experiences (ACEs). The Committee directs CMS to work with the National Child Traumatic Stress Network and CDC to provide a report no later than one year after the enactment of this act that evaluates how Medicaid could be leveraged to screen, diagnose, and provide evidence-based interventions to children ages 0-21 suffering from adverse childhood experiences. Ambulatory Surgical Centers. \u2014The Committee requests CMS submit a report within 180 days of enactment of this Act on the migration of procedures to ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs). The report should evaluate volume changes in hospital outpatient de-partments and ASCs for procedures that have been added to the ambulatory surgical center payable list since 2008. Annual Wellness Exam. \u2014The Committee understands that many Medicare beneficiaries are not utilizing the Annual Wellness Exam benefit and urges CMS to continue outreach to providers to empha-size the value of this service and to better understand barriers to higher participation. Biosimilar Utilization. \u2014The Committee is concerned about the underutilization of lower cost biosimilars, particularly those in Medicare Part B, and encourages CMS to support development and implementation of new policies that may help increase biosimilar uptake when clinically appropriate, such as reducing patient co- pays or other mechanisms. Blue Button. \u2014The Committee is concerned about low beneficiary participation rates in the Blue Button program due to their lack of awareness about Blue Button, how to access it, and how to use it. The Committee directs CMS to submit a report within 90 days of enactment of this Act on the active participant levels in Blue But-ton since its inception and detailed information about what the agency is doing to promote participation in this program and edu-cate beneficiaries about its benefits. Breakthrough Pathway. \u2014The Committee notes that FDA's accel- erated approval pathways, like the Breakthrough pathway, play an important role in expediting review of products that address sig-nificant unmet need and have compelling clinical data. After FDA approval, however, patients are often still unable to access these therapies if the disease does not yet have an appropriate ICD-10 diagnosis code. To ensure timely access to Breakthrough products, the Committee urges CMS to use its existing authority to review ICD-10 CM codes in an expedited manner. Breast Prosthetics. \u2014The Committee is encouraged by the deploy- ment of new technologies related to prosthesis. The Committee urges CMS to ensure Medicare recipients recovering from breast cancer are given the opportunity, under the care of a medical pro-fessional, to select custom breast prosthetics. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul Dental Officer. \u2014The Committee is concerned that the Chief Dental Officer position at CMS has been vacant since October 2017, leaving a significant gap of clinical oral health expertise within CMS. Medicaid provides oral health services to millions of people across the country, including vulnerable populations such as children, pregnant women, and disabled adults. A licensed dentist clinician is an invaluable resource to CMS's growing oral health strategy to expand access to care. The Committee urges CMS to move forward with filling this vacancy. CMMI Strong Start Initiative. \u2014The Committee continues to be concerned that the U.S. spends significantly more per capita on childbirth than any other industrialized nation\u2014with costs esti-mated over $50 billion annually\u2014but continues to rank behind al-most all other developed countries in birth outcomes for both moth-ers and babies, including high rates of preterm birth, low birth weight, and high maternal and infant mortality. The Committee is aware that the CMMI Strong Start Initiative, as well as other re-search studies, have shown that models of care utilizing Certified Nurse Midwives, birth centers and licensed doulas are associated with higher patient satisfaction and improved outcomes for moth-ers and infants. The Committee looks forward to the report, re-quested in House Report 116-62, that would build on the CMMI Strong Start Initiative to develop a proposal for CMS to increase access to birth centers and midwives in all state Medicaid pro-grams, and incentivize this model of care for low-risk women. Comprehensive Dental Care. \u2014The Committee notes that States have flexibility to determine dental benefits for adult Medicaid en-rollees and, while most states provide at least emergency dental services for adults, less than half of States currently provide com-prehensive dental care. The Committee urges CMS to study the benefit of comprehensive dental coverage for adults and submit rec-ommendations to Congress within 180 days of the date of enact-ment of this Act regarding policies to increase coverage of, and ac-cess to, comprehensive dental benefits for adults in State Medicaid programs. Co-Prescribing of Overdose Reversal Drugs. \u2014The Committee en- courages CMS to issue policy guidance to any State that receives federal Medicaid funds to refer to the CDC Guidelines for the co- prescribing of overdose reversal drugs for all individuals who are at risk of overdose, as defined by the CDC Opioid Prescribing Guidelines. Coverage for Naloxone. \u2014The Committee encourages CMS to issue policy guidance to any State that receives federal Medicaid funds to provide coverage for naloxone currently available as a nasal spray, an auto-injector, or both, if approved by the FDA for community use. Critical Access Hospitals. \u2014The Committee supports the unique role played by critical access hospitals (CAH) in rural areas and supports policy considerations that incorporate the important role played by CAHs. Critical Access Hospitals. \u2014Mental and Behavioral Health.\u2014The Committee requests the GAO conduct a review of the cost of emer-gency mental and behavioral health services provided at Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs), including an analysis of potential cost- savings if CAHs expanded access to preventive mental health serv- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul opioid use disorder treatment in rural areas and currently underserved areas. Diabetes. \u2014Diabetes remains a growing disease area which costs roughly $327 billion dollars to the U.S. healthcare system annually. Individuals living with diabetes very often have a multitude of chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease. In recent years, a specific class of diabetes medications known as sodium-glu-cose transport protein 2 inhibitors (SGLT2) have acquired clinical data that illustrates a significant decline in cardiovascular risk and mortality. As a result, existing American Diabetes Association guidelines as well as the American College of Cardiology rec-ommend SGLT2 inhibitors as the most clinically appropriate first line branded option. The Committee supports robust evaluation of policy options to address the prevalence of diabetes. Diabetes Technologies. \u2014The Committee is concerned about ac- cess to new technologies to treat diabetes. The Committee requests a report within 120 days of enactment of this Act outlining cov-erage and payment policies for new technologies for individuals with diabetes, including hybrid-closed loop technologies. Diabetic Retinopathy. \u2014The Committee notes that diabetic ret- inopathy remains a major national health challenge. According to the National Eye Institute, early detection and treatment of dia-betic retinopathy can reduce the risk of blindness by 95 percent. The Committee urges CMS to update its policy to promote earlier diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. Direct and Indirect Remuneration Penalties. \u2014The Committee is concerned that direct and indirect remuneration penalties (DIR penalties) have skyrocketed by 1600% in the last five years, total-ing $8.5 billion since 2013.These fees are often imposed as clawbacks, recouped months\u2014even a year\u2014after a drug is dis-pensed. DIR penalties are ostensibly based on metrics designed for health plans, but these metrics often don't apply to pharmacies or are set at unattainable thresholds. In short, these excessive DIR penalties pose an existential threat to many independent and spe-cialty pharmacies. The Committee directs CMS to review the amount of DIR penalties collected from pharmacies in Medicare Part D networks and assess the impact of these penalties on inde-pendent and specialty pharmacies\u2014including the impact on 340B safety net providers like Ryan White clinics and Federally Quali-fied Health Centers. The Committee requests a report on the re-sults of this review within 180 days of enactment of this Act. Disproportionate Share Hospitals. \u2014The Committee instructs CMS to compile publicly available information on hospitals that re-ceive payments under Medicaid as disproportionate share hospitals. Such information shall include the Medicaid inpatient utilization rate and low-income utilization rate. Within each category, CMS should further identify such hospitals by rural or urban status; number of beds, and; status as a major teaching hospital. Drug Quality. \u2014The Committee is deeply concerned about the discovery of dangerous levels of carcinogens in frequently pre-scribed medications, including angiotensin II like losartan valsartan, ranitidine, and metformin. As two of the country's largest payers for prescription medication, Medicare and Medicaid have a responsibility to help ensure the safety and quality of prescribed therapies. The Committee requests VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, a report within 180 days of enactment on the amount of money that the Medicare and Medicaid programs spent on medication in the previous three fiscal years that was subsequently recalled by manufacturers due to the detection of contaminants (including NDMA), adverse event reports, and sterility concerns. Enhancing Tools to Detect Cognitive Impairment. \u2014The Com- mittee remains concerned about the underutilization of the cog-nitive impairment detection component of the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit and is aware of multiple efforts to address this chal-lenge. To support this effort, the Committee directs CMS to update educational materials for Medicare beneficiaries as to the avail-ability of this benefit and the importance of regular assessments of cognitive health, including the value of establishing cognitive health baselines. The Committee also directs CMS to develop simi-larly updated materials for healthcare providers including informa-tion on the importance of baseline and regular assessments as well as tools available to conduct such assessments. Evaluation and Management Services. \u2014The Committee applauds CMS for finalizing significant changes to outpatient evaluation and management (E/M) services in the Calendar Year 2020 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) scheduled to take effect January 1, 2021. This policy represents important first steps toward improving the documentation and valuation of these services and the Com-mittee is eager to see if these changes begin to address workforce shortages in a number of cognitive physician specialties that affect Medicare beneficiaries' access to care. Despite revisions to the out-patient E/M codes, the Committee is concerned that their valuation still does not accurately reflect the resources required to deliver them and will therefore be insufficient to sustain the workforce in many cognitive specialties. Extravasations. \u2014The Committee is aware of evidence dem- onstrating the prevalence of extravasations in nuclear medicine procedures. Extravasations of diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals neg-atively affect the sensitivity and quantification of nuclear medicine scans and can affect disease staging and treatment assessment, re-sult in unnecessary invasive procedures and additional radiation exposure, and lead to higher costs for patients and payers. The Committee is pleased CMS is engaging with outside stakeholders to consider using a variety of levers to encourage providers to en-gage in nuclear medicine injection quality control and assurance. The Committee requests an update on this issue in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification. Financial Impacts of Rulemaking. \u2014The Committee urges CMS to evaluate the financial impacts on rural hospitals and Critical Ac-cess Hospitals in all rulemaking relating to payment rates, includ-ing all pending rules relating to CMS's outpatient prospective pay-ment system (OPPS) and the Medicare ambulatory surgical center (ASC) payment system. Fire Safety and Health Care Facilities. \u2014The Committee is con- cerned that CMS does not adopt on a regular basis the most recent edition of the National Fire Protection Association's Life Safety Code (NFPA 101), which by reference includes the Health Care Fa-cilities Code (NFPA 99). The NFPA code is updated every three years to ensure the latest advances in safety and technology are in-corporated into the code. In July of 2016, CMS adopted the 2012 VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, Life Safety Code. The most current revision is 2018. Thus far CMS has not expressed a timeframe to adopt the 2018 revision and is currently working from a code that was established by NFPA over seven years ago. The Committee is aware that CMS previously per-mitted the use of ''categorical waivers,'' including allowances for healthcare organizations to comply with specific sections of the 2012 Life Safety Code before the entire code document was adopt-ed. Critically, these ''categorical waivers'' did not require a healthcare organization to make a formal request to CMS to utilize these waivers, nor did they need to wait until being cited for a defi-ciency. Instead, a healthcare organization could proactively docu-ment its election to use one of the available waivers. The Com-mittee urges CMS to reinstate the ''categorical waivers'' it pre-viously permitted in order to ensure hospitals have access to prod-ucts that provide the highest level of safety to their facilities, em-ployees, and patients. GAO Report on Anesthesia Services. \u2014The Committee recognizes the important and unique role of anesthesia services and the lack of data on payment rates across markets. The Committee looks for-ward to the report requested under this heading in House Report 116-62. Geographic Practice Cost Index. \u2014The Committee encourages CMS to create a more transparent process for the development of Geographic Practice Cost Index so that the various inputs can be better understood. Health Inequalities. \u2014The Committee recognizes the importance of understanding and addressing the needs of health inequalities amongst minority populations. To ensure these populations are bet-ter served by programs and offices within HHS, the Committee di-rects the Secretary to maintain the collection of data pertaining to health inequalities, as defined by Healthy People 2020, on surveys administered with funding from this Act. Home Health Payment Systems. \u2014The Committee urges CMS to avoid home health payment systems that would risk patient access to home health providers in rural areas. The Committee requests a report within 90 days of enactment of this Act regarding the im-pact of implementation of home health payment systems on the de-livery of home health services. Homelessness. \u2014The Committee recognizes that homelessness can unnecessarily drive up Medicaid costs through excessive use of emergency room care, and that providing housing and resident services to this population can reduce such costs. The Committee directs HHS to report on the extent and types of waivers that exist to allow Medicaid funds to be used for affordable housing and resi-dent services, in order to reduce Medicaid costs for families and in-dividuals with disproportionate levels of health care expenditures. Such report shall include any efforts HHS has made or plans to make that would encourage such use through guidance to states or use of demonstration projects. Hospital Acquired Conditions. \u2014The Committee continues its de- sire for CMS to take action to prevent hospital-acquired pressure ulcers and pressure injuries (HAPUIs) that impact about 2.5 mil-lion patients each year and kill more than 60,000 hospital patients per year. Most HAPUIs are preventable with the application of evi-dence-based protocols. In November 2019, the International Pres- VerDate Sep 11 2014 05:16 Jul sure Injury Prevention and Treatment Clinical Practice Guidelines were released, which includes the Standardized Pressure Injury Prevention Protocol (SPIPP), a checklist that simplifies the guide-lines into actionable steps. The Committee expects CMS to take specific steps to promote and incentivize the use of the SPIPP, es-pecially in hospitals that care for Medicare patients. The Com-mittee requests an update in the fiscal year 2022 Budget Request with a timeline and steps taken and planned to promote the use of the SPIPP to reduce the number of HAPUI's among Medicare beneficiaries. Hospitals in the U.S. Virgin Islands. \u2014The Committee is con- cerned that Medicare payments for hospitals in the United States Virgin Islands are calculated using out-of-date payment data and formulas under the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA). The two hospitals in the United States Virgin Is-lands are reimbursed based on 1982 and 1996 costs, respectively. As a result, patients are forced to travel outside the territory for necessary services, including total joint replacements and chemo-therapy, often at great expense and personal hardship. The Com-mittee encourages CMS to update the TEFRA base period for these hospitals to more accurately reflect current conditions and costs. Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment. \u2014The Committee di- rects CMS to comply with the Federal Court ruling issued on Octo-ber 21, 2019 (Civil Action No. 18-2841-RMC, Document 38) order-ing CMS to reverse payment cuts outlined in the 2018 Rule titled ''Changes to Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment and Ambu-latory Surgical Center Payment Systems and Quality Reporting Programs'' (84-FR-53603) and provide backpay to hospitals within 30 days of enactment of this Act for reimbursements paid out dur-ing the time that this rule was in effect. CMS is directed to submit an update to the Committee within 30 days of enactment of this Act on the status of compliance with this Federal court ruling and the status of backpay. Intravenous Immunoglobulin. \u2014The Committee is aware of an on- going demonstration program evaluating a bundled payment cov-ering items and services needed to administer intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in the home to beneficiaries with primary immunodeficiency diseases (PI), which is currently set to expire De-cember 31, 2020. The Committee notes that beneficiaries enrolled in the demonstration may face a gap in these services between the expiration of the demonstration program including future exten-sions and the implementation of updated payment models based on report findings. The Committee encourages CMS to conduct an in-terim evaluation of the current project to be completed prior to the end of the project to accelerate evidence generation and remove any potential gap in services. Limited Wraparound Coverage. \u2014The Committee is deeply con- cerned that the Administration did not extend the limited wrap-around coverage pilot program or make the program permanent. This failure has caused significant uncertainty for patients who de-pended on this program for several years. The Committee directs CMS to submit a report within 90 days of enactment of this Act outlining a plan to ensure that participants impacted by the expira-tion of the pilot program will receive benefits equivalent to those of the limited wraparound coverage program. This report should in- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, an analysis of the outcomes of the pilot program and an ex- planation for CMS's decision not to extend it. Liquid Oxygen. \u2014The Committee notes with continued concern beneficiary problems in accessing liquid oxygen. The Committee di-rects CMS to report within 60 days of enactment of this Act on cur-rent access to liquid oxygen, including data on recent trends in liq-uid oxygen use during the period 2010 2019 by Medicare bene-ficiaries, and to work with stakeholders to implement appropriate monitoring plans to ensure continued access to all appropriate oxy-gen therapy when the competitive bidding program resumes in 2021. Malnutrition and Seniors. \u2014Malnutrition in older adults remains a serious health problem in the United States. In particular, cancer and cancer care increase the risk of malnutrition, and older pa-tients with cancer are one of the patient populations most under-diagnosed with malnutrition. However, CMS has still not included malnutrition quality measurements in the hospital Inpatient Qual-ity Reporting Program (IQRP). The Committee remains concerned that, by failing to include such measures, the U.S. health care sys-tem is not taking advantage of the clinical and financial benefits of quality malnutrition care. The Committee again strongly urges CMS to include malnutrition quality measurements in the hospital IQRP as well as evaluate other potential policy levers, such as inte-grating malnutrition into CMS Innovation Center Pilots, Advanced Payment Models, Population Health Initiatives, and the Oncology Care Model, to address malnutrition in the Medicare population. Measuring Incidence and Prevalence of Mild Cognitive Impair- ment and Alzheimer's Disease. \u2014The Committee remains interested in better understanding the impact of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease, and other related dementias on Medi-care beneficiaries to ensure the Medicare program is able to ad-dress current and future needs. To gather such information, the Committee directs CMS to develop and incorporate within the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey a module of questions per-taining to MCI, Alzheimer's disease, and other related dementias including if beneficiaries have received a diagnosis of either condi-tion and how long it took for them to receive such a diagnosis; if their providers have used the cognitive detection component of the Annual Wellness Visit; and if the beneficiaries have been advised about Alzheimer's and dementia care planning services that are covered under Medicare. Medicaid Dental Audits. \u2014The Committee raised concerns in House Report 116-62 that failure to use professional guidelines or established state Medicaid manual parameters in the auditing process can result in inaccurate and unreasonable Medicaid dental audits, negatively impacting dentist participation in the program and patient access to care. While State Medicaid agencies (SMA) have significant responsibility in managing provider audits, the Committee believes that as part of CMS oversight of the Medicaid program it is appropriate to issue guidance to SMAs concerning best practices in dental audits and offer training in such practices. The Committee urges CMS to develop such guidance for SMAs, in collaboration with the American Association of People with Disabil-ities and American Dental Association, and report to the Com- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, within 90 days of enactment of this Act on steps taken to develop such guidance. Medicaid Reimbursement for Birthing Centers. \u2014The Committee urges CMS to provide technical assistance and expedited review for States submitting Medicaid state plan amendments implementing Medicaid reimbursement for birthing centers, midwives, and doulas in order to reduce maternal mortality, especially among African American and other high-risk populations. Medically Tailored Meals. \u2014The Committee is aware of peer-re- viewed research showing that medically tailored meals can improve health outcomes and reduce health care utilization, and further un-derstands that some Medicare Advantage plans have partnered with community-based organizations to incorporate medically tai-lored meals as a covered benefit. The Committee requests a report within 120 days of enactment of this Act outlining how Medicare Advantage and state Medicaid plans are using medically tailored meals and related nutrition interventions within their coverage plans. Medicare Accelerated and Advanced Payments Program. \u2014The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall submit a report within 30 days of enactment of this Act, and every 90 days there-after until the public health emergency declared by the Secretary on January 27, 2020, with respect to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus, is no longer in effect, to the Committees on Appropriations, Ways and Means, and Energy and Commerce of the House of Representa-tives and the Committees on Appropriations and Finance of the Senate, providing a full accounting, including methodology, of fed-eral loans provided in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 through the Medicare Accelerated and Advanced Payments Program. For dis-tributions occurring on or after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall require any provider or supplier receiving dis-tributions to attest to whether such provider or supplier is owned and controlled by a private-equity entity. Such information shall be included in the HHS quarterly report, and shall include an ac-counting of the number of private equity owned and controlled pro-viders (by provider category) and the amount of funding such pro-viders in each category received, by individual provider number. The Committee requests that future distributions of funds account for a provider or supplier's reserve accounts as well as patients treated for COVID-19. As a condition of funding for private-equity backed hospitals and health systems, the Secretary should consider requiring that no providers face furloughs or cuts to pay or bene-fits. The Committee requests that the Secretary of Treasury re-quire any reporting person who holds interest in a specified med-ical care provider, controls such provider, and is engaged in any trade or business in which such provider is directly or indirectly an expanded specified asset or receives any service from any person engaged in an applicable trade or businesselectronically file a sepa-rate annual return with respect to each medical care provider that contains information relating to gross receipts, real estate owner-ship, and other payments to related persons. Medicare Promotion. \u2014The Committee directs CMS to avoid tak- ing any action that actively promotes one form of Medicare cov-erage over another, particularly with respect to the choice between traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage. The Committee fur- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul directs CMS to maintain its online coverage options tool in a manner that provides complete and unbiased information, particu-larly the redesigned Medicare Plan Finder. Furthermore, CMS should remain objective and neutral in its education and outreach materials concerning options that beneficiaries have during the open enrollment period and at any other time. Medicare-reimbursable Expenses. \u2014The Committee is concerned that CMS is considering regulations or guidance that would regu-late the allocation of funds from a liability or no-fault related set-tlement, judgment, award, or other payment to pay for an individ-ual's future medical or future prescription drug treatment expenses that would otherwise be reimbursable by Medicare. The Committee urges the agency not to promulgate a mandatory or voluntary regu-lation, which would be likely to harm Medicare beneficiaries, as well as the liability primary plan providers such as automobile, li- ability or no-fault insurers including those who self-insure. Medicare Reimbursement for Virtual Health Services. \u2014The Com- mittee requests CMS submit a report within 180 days of enactment of this Act outlining Medicare's current policy for payment of vir-tual health services (including digital health tools and ancillary services) for chronic conditions. This report should include data and other pertinent information on current utilization of such services by Medicare beneficiaries using the most currently available data. The report should assess opportunities to expand access to services for chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries under current authority, which beneficiaries would benefit most from access to such services, and gaps or limitations on HHS's authority to expand access to these beneficiaries. Mental Health Parity. \u2014The Committee recognizes the important role Mental Health parity laws have in ensuring access to medical care and treatment. The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equality Act (MHPAEA) requires insurers to cover care for mental health and substance use disorders at the same level as other med-ical and surgical care services. However, without proper oversight and compliance, patients are left fighting for coverage of benefits. The Committee is concerned there is still a lack of compliance among insurance companies not adequately covering mental and behavioral health services and providers more than 11years after MHPAEA passed. The Committee urges the Administrator of CMS to create guidelines, in which all States or, where appropriate, Medicaid Managed Care Organizations are required to submit a public compliance report, with the application of nonquantitative treatment limitations while ensuring that any proprietary, per-sonal, or confidential consumer information is protected. The Com-mittee urges CMS to issue a public compliance report based on CMS's 2017 Parity Compliance Toolkit Applying Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Parity Requirements to Medicaid and Children s Health Insurance Programs. The Committee further urges the Administrator of CMS to annually report any auditing and enforcement of such plans. New Medical Residency Training Programs. \u2014Given the growing physician workforce shortage, the Committee strongly encourages CMS to utilize its discretion to extend the time period described in section 413.79(e) of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, for new residency programs in areas facing physician shortages before a VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, resident cap is applied, as authorized in P.L. 105 33. The Committee looks forward to receiving CMS's report on these efforts within 60 days of the enactment of that Act, as di-rected in House Report 116-62. New Technologies. \u2014The Committee encourages CMS to provide adequate time for adaptation of new technologies, from a proce-dural and an administrative perspective, before adjusting payment based on claims data. Non-Emergency Medical Transportation. \u2014The Committee in- cludes a prohibition against the Department publishing a proposed regulation relating to Medicaid non-emergency medical transpor-tation (NEMT) benefits. The fiscal year 2020 Appropriations Act for the Department of Health and Human Services included $300,000 for MACPAC to examine the benefits of NEMT from State Med-icaid programs on Medicaid beneficiaries, including benefits with chronic diseases such as end stage renal disease, substance use dis-orders, pregnant mothers, and patients living in remote, rural areas, and to examine the benefits of improving local coordination of NEMT with public transportation and other Federally-assisted transportation services. The Joint Explanatory Statement accom-panying the Act directed HHS to take no regulatory action on the availability of NEMT services until the study has been completed. Non-Group Health Plans. \u2014The Committee directs CMS to sub- mit a report within 60 days of enactment of this Act with options for modifying existing processes so that Non-Group Health Plans may receive query responses that include the name and address of any Medicare Advantage or Part D plan in which the queried indi-vidual currently is enrolled, or, within the last three years, has been enrolled. Non-Opioid Pain Management. \u2014The Committee believes that providing affordable non-opioid pain management to patients cov-ered by Medicare and Medicaid is critical to combating drug addic-tion and the opioid crisis. The Committee looks forward to receiv-ing CMS's upcoming report on non-opioid pain management, as re-quired by section 6086 of the SUPPORT Act. Nursing Home Quality. \u2014The Committee includes $1,500,000 for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) to conduct a study of how the United States delivers, regulates, and measures the quality of nursing home care. In 1986, the Institute of Medicine (IOM, now NASEM) completed an evi-dence-based examination of nursing home quality and issued the landmark report, Improving the Quality of Care in Nursing Homes. In 1987, Congress enacted the Nursing Home Reform Act as part of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1987, after which the Health Care Finance Administration (now CMS) issued comprehensive regulations and survey processes to ''ensure that residents of nurs-ing homes receive quality care that will result in their highest practicable physical, mental and social well-being.'' These regula-tions for the most part are still in effect, most recently reissued as the 2016 Requirements of Participation. Over the past 30 years, the population served by nursing homes has changed significantly and the ability to understand and measure quality in long-term care settings has advanced significantly\u2014however, there has been no systematic review and analysis of the body of evidence regard-ing quality practices and measurement and how the evidence links VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, to the regulations and enforcement system. Congress finds that such a study is in the public interest to enhance the quality of life and care experienced by residents of nursing homes now and in the future, and that NASEM should examine the current regulatory structure and how it links to care outcomes; consistency and effec-tiveness of oversight, enforcement, and penalties; evidence about which interventions produce high quality care in nursing homes; workforce and competencies needed to deliver high-quality care in nursing homes; current Medicare and Medicaid nursing home pay-ment models and whether they support delivery of high-quality care and regulatory compliance; what consumers and family mem-bers seek and value in nursing home care; and alternative struc-tures, policies, and care models to promote care innovation and as-sure quality. Nutrition Education. \u2014The Committee encourages CMS to coordi- nate with HRSA to promote expanded nutrition education in med-ical school and graduate medical education curricula. Pharmacists and Patient Care Services. \u2014The Committee is aware that certain Medicare Part B services and care frameworks have provisions to include pharmacists and their patient care serv-ices. However, CMS has few, if any, mechanisms to identify and evaluate pharmacists' contributions to patient care and outcomes or to identify barriers within current service requirements that pre-vent scalable involvement of pharmacists. The Committee urges CMS to create a mechanism to provide greater visibility into the scope and outcomes of the Medicare services currently provided by pharmacists. In addition, CMS should consider testing such system in a CMMI model to assess barriers to pharmacist participation in current Medicare services and to evaluate the contributions of pharmacists to team-based care and better health outcomes in Medicare beneficiaries. Program Integrity. \u2014The Committee applauds the efforts of CMS to recover significant funding due to potential waste, fraud, and abuse in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Committee re-quests an update within 180 days of enactment of this Act on the Recovery Audit Validation Contractor program, National Cor-recting Coding Initiative, and related integrity programs, data re-porting standards around these programs, and the feasibility or challenges of expanding these programs to other public payer pro-grams. These or any enhanced recovery efforts must be imple-mented carefully so as not to inadvertently curb beneficiary access to care should health care providers come to fear retribution for minor billing errors or honest mistakes. Program of All-Inclusive Care. \u2014The Committee acknowledges the important role of the Program of All-Inclusive Care (PACE) in the lives of over 52,000 participants, by allowing these highly medi-cally complex Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries to live at home, instead of in a nursing facility. The Committee urges CMS to move forward expeditiously on PACE-specific pilots, authorized by the PACE Innovation Act of 2015, specifically testing the innovative, comprehensive, integrated, and fully risk-bearing PACE model of care with new Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries. Provider Shortages in Non-Contiguous States. \u2014The Committee requests a report within 180 days of enactment of this Act on pro-vider shortages in noncontiguous States. The report should in- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, of existing payment rates and provide rec- ommendations to address provider shortages in both primary care and specialty fields. Radiation Oncology Model. \u2014The Committee is concerned that the Radiation Oncology (RO) Model as currently proposed could po-tentially reduce access to certain types of radiation therapy and negatively affect patient outcomes. The Committee requests CMS submit a report within 90 days of enactment of this Act on the im-pact of the RO Model on patient access and outcomes and the im-pact on therapy providers. Regulatory and Payment Reforms. \u2014The Committee directs CMS to work with hospitals and community-based organizations to iden-tify substantive regulatory delivery and payment reforms that, among other things, integrate behavioral health in primary care; create new and evaluates existing delivery models to improve spending efficiency and value-based care, and; incentivize the health care workforce to meet the unmet care needs of Medicare beneficiaries in underserved areas. The Committee also directs CMS to work with stakeholders, including Medicare beneficiaries and providers, to consider these goals. Regulatory Requirements Impacting Advanced Practice Registered Nurses and Physician Assistants. \u2014The Committee requests that CMS submit a report within 120 days of enactment of this Act on regulatory requirements that impact Advanced Practice Registered Nurses and Physician Assistants, including potential modifications that would reduce these requirements. Robotic Stereotactic Radiosurgery. \u2014The Committee continues to support robotic stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and robotic stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). The Committee urges CMS to maintain sufficient payment for SRS and SBRT to ensure viability in both the hospital and freestanding center setting. Sepsis. \u2014The Committee is pleased that CMS and the National Quality Forum plan to update the SEP 1 measure. A CMS study published in February reported an alarming 40 percent increase in the number of Medicare patients hospitalized with sepsis over the past seven years. Medicare spent more than $41.5 billion on sepsis care in 2018. The Committee supports this effort and encourages CMS to issue a Request for Information as part of this review to collect broad stakeholder input to help ensure the new SEP 1 measure improves health outcomes. The Committee requests an update on these activities in the fiscal year 2022 Budget Justifica-tion. Social Determinants of Health. \u2014The Committee is aware that so- cial determinants of health are critical drivers of health outcomes and health care costs and that early childhood development is af-fected by social factors. The Committee encourages CMS to clarify and disseminate the strategies that States can implement under current Medicaid and CHIP authority, or through waivers, to ad-dress social determinants of health in the provision of health care, including strategies specifically targeting the pediatric population. This should include guidance on how States can encourage and incentivize managed care organizations to address social deter-minants of health through contracts. In addition, academic medical centers can be leaders in addressing social determinants of health. The Committee encourages CMS to identify opportunities to part- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul ner with academic medical centers to find innovative approaches to addressing social determinants of health, especially at academic medical centers that have expertise in addressing health dispari-ties and are affiliated with Historically Black Colleges and Univer-sities, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, or other Minority-Serving In-stitutions. STD Screening and Treatment Initiative. \u2014The Committee con- tinues to be concerned about high rates of STDs, especially among pregnant women and young adults. To help curb the spread of these diseases and address this public health problem, and to reach at-risk and vulnerable populations at every opportunity, the Com-mittee urges CMS to collaborate with the CDC's Division of STD Prevention to develop a screening and treatment initiative under its Medicaid Program. Technology and Mail Management Modernization. \u2014The Com- mittee supports efforts by CMS to modernize its information tech-nology and mail management systems. Ensuring that beneficiaries receive prompt and accurate written communication regarding Medicare, Medicare, and the Affordable Care Act is especially im-portant during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. These invest-ments can improve service to beneficiaries, increase efficiency, and decrease costs by giving CMS greater control over outgoing mail, being able to track and identify bad addresses, and improving tracking and accountability. The Committee encourages CMS to continue to innovate and modernize its mail management systems. Telehealth. \u2014 Recent legislative expansions of telehealth have provided safe and reliable access to healthcare for millions of Americans. In response to the global outbreak of COVID-19, these efforts have rapidly changed how medical providers deliver efficient services, which are especially critical in rural America. Therefore, the Committee strongly encourages CMS through its rulemaking to maximize access to healthcare through telehealth with equitable payment and reimbursement policies. Vaccine Cost-Sharing. \u2014The Committee notes that addressing cost-sharing and reimbursement issues with Medicare Part D vac-cines is critical to ensuring that Medicare beneficiaries have access to vaccines that have the potential to prevent serious disease. To address low vaccination rates, the Committee urges CMS to iden-tify options for patients to have no-cost access to Part D vaccines, similar to coverage of Part B vaccines. Vaccine Preventable Illnesses. \u2014The Committee is concerned about the underutilization of vaccinations for adults and, in par-ticular, high-risk adults where rates do not exceed 20 percent for certain recommended immunizations. The Committee urges CMS to work toward achievement of the Healthy People 2030 goals aimed at reducing the incidence of vaccine preventable illnesses, such as invasive pneumococcal infections, and increase the percent-age of adults (aged 65 or older) who are vaccinated against pneu-mococcal disease. CMS is encouraged to support development and implementation of electronic health records and other technologies, such as reminder recall programs, to identify Medicare bene-ficiaries who have not received the full course of recommended vac-cinations and provide information to those beneficiaries and their providers of the risks of vaccine preventable conditions and empha-size the importance of adherence to the recommendations. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, Providers. \u2014The Committee recog- nizes that preventable violence against health care and social serv-ice employees such as nurses, physicians, emergency responders, medical assistants, and social workers, has been and remains on the rise, resulting in not only serious harm to these providers and their ability to provide quality care, but also to those they serve. Given the prevalence of violent incidences across health care and social services settings, the Committee requests CMS (in coordina-tion with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) submit a report within 180 days of enactment of this Act on the degree and extent to which health care facilities and social services settings have adopted and implemented the practices and controls recommended by the Occupational Safety and Health Ad-ministration's (OSHA) Guidelines for the Prevention of Violence for Health Care and Social Service Workers; whether the Joint Com-mission has fully assessed compliance by health care facilities with its recommended practices issued in April 2018; and whether there are gaps in the adoption and full implementation of OSHA Guide-lines and Joint Commission recommendations. Such strategies should be a core consideration in ongoing CMS initiatives to safe-guard patient and worker safety, improve quality and care, and re-ward high-performing providers. State Survey and Certification The Committee provides $407,334,000 for State Survey and Cer- tification activities, which is $10,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $34,858,000 less than the fiscal year 2021 budget request. State Survey and Certification supports certifications of Medicare and Medicaid certified health care facilities to ensure that beneficiaries receive care at facilities that meet health, safety, and quality standards required by CMS. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included not less than $100,000,000 for State Survey and Certification activities to in-crease inspections of nursing home facilities in localities with com-munity transmission of coronavirus. The Committee urges CMS to coordinate with the Department of Veterans Affairs on oversight of long-term care facilities under the Department of Veterans Affairs, including surveys of such facilities. The Committee is concerned about the Administration's efforts to prevent and respond to the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on our nation's nursing home residents and staff. According to data collected by the New York Times, as of June 26, ''at least 54,000 residents and workers have died from the coronavirus at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities for older adults in the United States.'' Nursing homes and long-term facilities for older adults account for approximately 43 percent of all deaths in the U.S. due to COVID-19. As evidence mounted last April that the approximately 15,500 nursing homes nationwide are especially vulnerable to the coronavirus, CMS was slow to provide clear guidance, oversight, and resources to state agencies on the frontlines. The CARES Act provided CMS an additional $200,000,000 to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus, with the requirement that at least $100,000,000 of the total be used to support increased State and Federal oversight of nursing homes. Congress expected CMS to use VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, these funds to ensure nursing homes were adhering to standards for quality of care, infection control, and maintaining sufficient staffing to minimize the spread of the virus and protect patients and staff. However, as of June 1, CMS had allocated approximately $1,500,000 of this emergency supplemental funding to a handful of State oversight agencies. The Committee remains troubled that very little of this funding has been allocated and directs CMS to release funding to States and territories in need through an expe-dited process. Federal Administration The Committee provides $732,533,000 for Federal Administration activities related to the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $40,000,000 below the fiscalyear2021 budget request. The Federal Administra-tion funding supports CMS staff, along with operating and admin-istrative expenses for information technology, communication, utili-ties, rent and space requirements, as well as administrative con-tracts. Quality Improvement Organizations. \u2014The Committee does not support the Administration's proposal to shift personnel costs to the Federal Administration account that have previously been funded by a mandatory appropriation. HEALTH CARE FRAUD AND ABUSE CONTROL ACCOUNT Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $786,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 813,000,000 ............................................................. 807,000,000 Change from ......................................................... +21,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a56,000,000 This includes a base amount of $311,000,000 and an additional $496,000,000 through a discretionary budget cap adjustment au-thorized under section 251(b) of the Balanced Budget and Emer-gency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account (HCFAC) funds support activities conducted by CMS, the HHS Office of Inspector General, and the Department of Justice. This level is $21,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 en-acted level and $6,000,000 below the fiscal year 2021 budget re-quest. This funding is in addition to other mandatory funding provided through authorizing legislation. The funding will provide resources to continue efforts for Medicaid program integrity activities, for safeguarding the Medicare prescription drug benefit and the Medi-care Advantage program, and for program integrity efforts related to these programs carried out by the Department of Justice. The Committee modifies bill language to enable the Secretary to fund the Senior Medicare Patrol Program administered by the Ad-ministration for Community Living from either discretionary or mandatory funds provided to this account. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, ADMINISTRATION FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES PAYMENTS TO STATES FOR CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT AND FAMILY SUPPORT PROGRAMS Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $2,890,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 3,039,000,000 ............................................................. 3,039,000,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +149,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - The Committee also recommends $1,400,000,000 in advance funding, as requested, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 to en-sure timely payments for Child Support Enforcement programs. These programs support State-administered programs of financial assistance and services for low-income families to promote their economic security and self-sufficiency. LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $3,740,304,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... - - - Committee Recommendation ............................................................. 3,765,304,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +25,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +3,765,304,000 The Committee recommends $3,765,304,000 for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance program, which is $25,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $3,765,304,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The Low Income Home Energy Assist-ance Program (LIHEAP) supports eligible families and households through programs providing assistance with energy costs. The Committee strongly opposes the Administration's proposal to elimi-nate this important program that serves almost six million low-in-come households each year. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $900,000,000 in emergency supplemental appropriations to help eli-gible families with energy costs. Hold Harmless. \u2014While the Committee recognizes the fiscal year 2020 bill made progress to limit annual decreases in State alloca-tions to no more than three percent of what a State received in the previous year, the Committee believes that all States have unmet needs and that all States benefit from the consistency of annual ap-propriations when the overall account is unchanged or increased. To correct this volatility and hold States, territories, and Tribes (funded through the States) harmless from annual reductions, the bill includes language directing the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) to distribute, at a minimum, the same amount of funding to States, territories, and Tribes as the fiscal year 2020 appropriation. LIHEAP Report. \u2014The Committee directs the program to submit a report within 180 days of enactment of this Act on recommenda-tions for reducing the volatility in annual State allocations as a re-sult of the statutory formula. The report should identify the meth-od by which each State's share of the new formula was based for FY 2016-FY 2020, as well as show each State's share of low income home energy expenditures and each State's share of the total fund- ing for that year. The report should identify what drove major changes for each State for each of these fiscal years. This analysis should also include a chart showing hypothetical total funding VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, that would trigger a State's new formula share to be based on its new formula percentage. As part of the report, the pro-gram should include a chart of revised State allocations for the past five years with the formula recalculated to take into account a changing (moving) prior three-year average of low income home energy expenditures, e.g. for FY 2016 it would be based on FY 2012, 2013, 2014 data, compared to a three-year average that is updated every third year. In addition, the report should include the extent to which it is feasible to project State allocations no less than six months prior to a new fiscal year, including whether it is possible to use energy cost projections, instead of currently used energy price data. While the Committee understands the com-plexity of the LIHEAP statutory framework as it exists today, it would be preferable to add predictability to the LIHEAP formula-tion process and annual State allocations. REFUGEE AND ENTRANT ASSISTANCE Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $1,908,201,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 2,456,380,000 ............................................................. 1,911,201,000 Change from ......................................................... +3,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a5545,179,000 The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) programs are designed to help refugees, asylees, Cuban and Haitian entrants, and traf-ficking victims become employed and self-sufficient. These pro-grams also provide for care of unaccompanied alien children in Federal custody and victims of torture. Funding for several of the programs within this account is highly dependent on estimates and as such, it is critical that ORR commu-nicate changes to estimated numbers of arrivals and costs as they become available. The Committee directs ORR to provide monthly updates of arrivals each month by category, including refugees, asylees, Cuban and Haitian entrants, Special Immigrant Visas, and unaccompanied alien children, to include any updates in estimated funding needs as a result of changes in trends in those categories. In addition, the Committee directs ORR to submit a report on ef-forts ORR is taking to ensure programming remains funded and prioritized to serve populations within ORR's mandate. This report shall be made publicly available and include how ORR intends to ensure that no additional barriers are put in place impacting an in-dividual's ability to seek protection and receive necessary ORR services. In times of sudden reductions in refugee arrivals, the Committee encourages HHS, to the extent practicable, to ensure that resettle-ment agencies are able to maintain their infrastructure and capac-ity at a level to continue to serve new refugees, previously arrived refugees, and other populations of concern who remain statutorily eligible for integration services, and to ensure that there is capacity for future arrivals to be adequately served. In addition, the Committee recognizes the importance of meeting the immediate needs of recently arrived refugees and other popu-lations receiving resettlement services due to the public health and economic crisis as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Com-mittee expects ORR to continue to engage with and approve State requests for additional flexibilities, including additional months of VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, and medical assistance for refugees and other qualified arriv- als, and for additional services available through the Refugee Sup-port Services program. Within the total, the Committee includes the following: Budget Activity FY 2021 Committee Transitional and Medical ................... $354,000,000 17,000,000 Transitional and Medical Services The Committee includes $354,000,000, which is equal to the fis- cal year 2020 enacted level and $75,441,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The Transitional and Medical Services (TAMS) program provides grants to States and nonprofit organiza-tions to provide refugees and other eligible populations with up to eight months of cash and medical assistance. Victims of Trafficking The Committee includes $29,755,000 for the Victims of Traf- ficking program, which is $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 en-acted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The rec-ommendation includes $4,500,000 for the National Human Traf-ficking Hotline. Health Care for Victims of Trafficking. \u2014The Committee supports efforts to build, expand, and sustain the capacity of Federally Qualified Health Centers to deliver trauma-informed, strength- based, and person-centered services to victims of human trafficking and their immediate family members. The Committee encourages ACF to work with university health centers, allied health profes-sions programs, and medical schools to provide health care and mental health services to treat the immediate and long-term health needs of victims of human trafficking and include human traf-ficking training in health professions academic programs to pre-pare students to recognize victims and intervene on their behalf. Human Trafficking in Rural Communities. \u2014The Committee sup- ports efforts to address combatting human trafficking in rural areas. The isolated geographies and transportation routes that fa-cilitate rapid, invisible movement of victims make these commu-nities uniquely vulnerable, and the opioid epidemic has com-pounded the issue. These factors also complicate the ability for so-cial services and health care providers to provide prevention and care to survivors. Many rural areas do not have the resources they need to address this crisis. The Committee encourages the Office on Trafficking in Persons to recognize this issue. Refugee Support Services The recommendation includes $207,201,000, which is equal to the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $56,380,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The Refugee Support Services (RSS) pro-gram provides formula and competitive grants to States and non-profit organizations to address barriers to employment and help refugees become self-sufficient. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul $1,303,245,000 for the Unaccom- panied Alien Children (UAC) Program, which is equal to the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The Committee believes this funding, in addition to funding still available from the Emergency Supple-mental Appropriations for Humanitarian Assistance and Security at the Southern Border Act, 2019 (P.L. 116-26) and the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (P.L. 116-94), to be suffi-cient to ensure the UAC program fulfills its mission to care for chil-dren in ORR's custody, and to place them with sponsors as expedi-tiously as possible. The Committee notes the sharp rise of unaccompanied children in ORR custody in 2018 and 2019\u2014and the corresponding need to open expensive, unlicensed influx facilities\u2014was a direct result of the Administration's misguided Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) and immoral Family Separation policy. The Committee further notes that the drastic reduction in the number of children referred to ORR in late 2019 through the Spring of 2020 are a result of the Administration's inhumane immigration policies, including Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) and the COVID-19-related border clos-ings, which the Committee believes to be illegal denials of an immi-grant's right to seek asylum in the United States under the Traf-ficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA). The Committee strongly opposes the Administration's disingen- uous use of authorities under the Public Health Service Act to evade its legal responsibilities under the TVPRA and to pursue its long-term goals of dismantling the Flores Agreement, which has been put in place to protect minors who cross the border without a parent or guardian. The Committee, once again, emphasizes that ORR is not an im- migration enforcement agency\u2014it is a social services agency whose purpose is to provide care for children in its custody and to place those children with sponsors as expeditiously as possible. To pro-tect ORR's core mission, the bill includes directive language and limitations on funding to minimize the adverse impacts of this Ad-ministration's inhumane policy agenda and to protect the safety and health of unaccompanied children in the agency's custody. The recommendation includes not less than $190,000,000 for legal services, post-release services, and child advocates. The Com-mittee directs ORR to provide quarterly reports to the Committee on the number of children receiving services from legal service pro- viders, the number receiving post-release services, and the number who are appointed child advocates. The report should also include the number of children on the waitlist for any of these services, if any, and what steps are being taken to ensure all children in cus-tody receive the services they need. The Committee supports the continued expansion of legal serv- ices for unaccompanied children and notes that services provided by qualified and independent legal counsel to unaccompanied chil-dren can increase the efficiency and effectiveness of immigration proceedings, significantly reduce the failure-to-appear rate of chil-dren who are released from HHS custody, and help relieve the im-migration court backlog. The recommendation includes funding and direction for ORR to ensure in-person ''Know Your Rights'' and legal screenings for every child in custody, and includes no less VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, spent in fiscal year 2021 for direct represen- tation services to children HHS custody, as well as traditional com-munities that are not currently being served. Post-release direct representation shall be made available to children up to funded ca-pacity, without restrictions related to: age while in ORR care; re-lease date; estimated time to conclude a case; or other characteris-tics, provided the representation is initiated while the individual is still a minor. In addition, the Committee strongly encourages ORR to work with legal service providers to develop a strategy to mini-mize the risks of any child having to go to immigration court with-out independent legal counsel. The recommendation includes an additional $5,500,000 for legal service providers to recruit and train additional attorneys for the purposes of building the capacity necessary to provide independent representation to unaccompanied children with pending immigration cases. The Committee strongly urges ORR to ensure that each new resi- dential care facility has a corresponding independent legal services provider (LSP) secured prior to placement of children at such facil-ity. The Committee directs ORR to ensure that shelters provide ap-propriate and confidential space for LSPs to meet with children, but strongly urges ORR be responsive to LSP requests for children to meet with LSPs offsite if that is more appropriate for the child. In addition, the Committee believes it is critical that children maintain access to legal services throughout the COVID-19 pan-demic. Should limits on in-person meetings due to shelter or pro-vider constraints shift communication with the child's attorney to telephonic or video means, these measures must be temporary, when done at the request of the child or their counsel, and should not be used as replacements for in-person legal access when the ac-tive public health emergency is sufficiently mitigated to allow for safe resumption of in-person legal access. The recommendation includes funding for ORR to expand Child Advocate services, and directs an additional $1,250,000 be used to offset matching requirements. The Committee expects ORR to en-sure the child advocates are appointed to particularly vulnerable children, including victims of abuse or trafficking, children 12 years old and younger, children in residential treatment centers, and to children who are expected to remain in ORR custody for prolonged periods of time. The Committee directs ORR to ensure the contin-ued independence of the Child Advocate program from other con-tracted service providers to avoid any conflicts of interest. To ensure that child advocates have the visibility and capacity to be appointed to the most pressing cases in ORR custody, the Com-mittee strongly urges ORR to proactively share census data from each facility with child advocates on a consistent basis. Such cen-sus should list the names, ages, countries of origins, languages and lengths of stay of each child in the program, which will help child advocates identify the children in greatest need. In addition, within 30 days of enactment of this Act, ORR shall provide to child advo-cates information for any category 4 children in custody with stays of over 120 days. The Committee recognizes ORR's efforts to provide additional post-release services to more children following release from ORR's care, and recommends additional funding to support sponsors prior to a child's release, to mitigate the risk for family breakdown, fa- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, into their communities, and assist with children's ability to comply with their immigration court pro-ceedings. In addition to children already designated under law or policy to receive such services, the Committee encourages ORR to ensure that all pregnant or parenting teens, children whose pri-mary language is neither English nor Spanish, as well as children who faced separation from a parent or legal guardian at the U.S./ Mexico border, are referred for post-release services. ORR should arrange for such services to be provided by non-governmental orga-nizations with experience and expertise in working with these chil-dren. Further, in determining additional groups of children who should be categorically referred for home studies and post-release services, the Committee directs ORR to formally engage with cur-rent family reunification service providers to help evaluate and identify new and additional risk factors for children. Age-Outs. \u2014The Committee is concerned about reports that most unaccompanied children turning 18 years old while in the care and custody of ORR are transferred directly to the custody of Immigra-tion and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The Committee directs ORR to develop a tangible post-18 plan for every 17-year-old unaccom-panied child in ORR care at least two weeks in advance of his or her 18th birthday. Each post-18 plan should at a minimum identify an appropriate non-secure placement for the child and identify any necessary social support services for the child. The Committee re-quests a briefing within 60 days of enactment of this Act on compli-ance with the directive included under this heading in House Re-port 116-62, and with any improvements made or resources nec-essary to ensure caseworkers have the capacity to complete these plans and document such plans in a consistent manner in ORR's electronic case management system. Children in Prolonged Detention. \u2014The Committee directs ORR to submit a report every six months on the number of children who have been in ORR custody longer than a year. Such report should include how long each child has been in ORR custody and a status update on their case, including the type of facility or placement where the child is currently being held; whether the child has any family or other potential sponsor(s) in the United States; and a summary of ORR's efforts to either unify the child with a sponsor or place the child into an ORR long-term foster care setting. The Committee directs ORR to ensure that a care provider is taking all steps necessary to place every child in a home as expeditiously as possible and that no child is unaccounted for, resulting in pro-longed detention. The Committee appreciates that as part of ORR's Discharge Rate Improvement Plan, ORR committed to creating a national UAC stakeholder group to discuss and incorporate stakeholder feedback on ORR policies and procedures that impact UAC operations and improvement discharge rates and procedures. The Committee un-derstands that part of the plan and stakeholder discussion will be focused on the growing population of children in ORR's care that have no identified sponsor, i.e. ''Category 4'' children. The Com-mittee understands that many stakeholders strongly believe that family foster home care should be the priority placement option for all children in Category 4 cases. The Committee expects ORR to give serious consideration to stakeholder recommendations, and VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul strongly urges ORR to reconsider the requirement that children in Category 4 cases demonstrate their potential eligibility for legal re-lief prior to placement in long-term foster care. Communicating with Congress. \u2014The Committee directs the De- partment to notify the Committee prior to making any administra-tive or policy changes expected to impact: the number of children in ORR custody; shelter operations; the placement of children with sponsors; or any post-release services. Community-Based Facilities. \u2014The Committee directs ORR to prioritize new grant or contract funding to small-scale, community- based residential care placements. As ORR adds State-licensed ca-pacity to its network, the Committee expects that no less than 50% of beds added to the network be in small-scale shelters, transitional foster care, small group homes, or long-term foster care. The Com-mittee directs ORR to ensure there is an adequate supply of long- term foster care beds in the network to minimize the time it takes for a child to be moved to this least restrictive placement. ORR should work closely with its long-term foster care providers to ex-pand its pool of foster families, particularly those experienced with caring for children with mental health and other specialized needs. The Committee directs ORR to notify the Committee prior to all new funding opportunity announcements, grant or contract awards, or plans to release or acquire property. Facility Oversight. \u2014The Committee expects ORR to maintain strict oversight of all ORR-funded care provider facilities and cor-rect violations of Federal, State or local codes related to the stand-ards of childcare or the well-being of children, as well as violations of ORR policies and procedures, or any requirements as listed in the Flores Settlement Agreement, regardless of the status of the underlying agreement. Within 90 days of enactment of this Act, ORR is directed to submit an updated version of the report sub-mitted to the Committee pursuant to House Report 115 862. The updated report should include new or updated information on facil-ity violations, and any systematic trends in noncompliance, along with efforts to remedy noncompliance across the provider facility network. The Committee expects ORR to improve its oversight of State li- censed shelters by implementing the recommendations included in the Office of the Inspector General's reports dated June 17, 2020. These improvements include collecting information that allows ORR to better track and show trends of serious safety incidents, addressing staffing shortages, and ensuring shelters maintain com-prehensive checklists to ensure the physical safety of sites housing unaccompanied children. The Committee directs the Department to provide a report to the Committee within six months of enactment detailing ORR's progress in implementing the recommendations contained in the Inspector General's reports. In addition, the Committee directs ORR to conduct annual com- prehensive monitoring visits to each provider facility. Within 30 days of ORR and a facility finalizing a response from a provider fa-cility to a monitoring visit report, ORR is directed to submit a copy of that response to the Committee along with any remedies that have been taken to address concerns observed during the moni-toring visit. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul Within 180 days of enactment of this Act, ORR is directed to sub- mit to the Committee a report that: (1) describes the frequency of ORR's comprehensive monitoring visits to each ORR facility within the past five fiscal years; (2) assesses the comprehensiveness, uni-formity, and effectiveness of ORR's monitoring protocols and proc-esses, and identifies actions needed to improve those protocols and processes; (3) specifically assesses the extent to which ORR's moni-toring protocols and processes address children's access to legal providers and the facilitation of timely release of children from care and placement; and (4) identifies actions needed to improve such access and facilitation. Fingerprinting of Unaccompanied Children. \u2014The Committee di- rects ORR to issue guidance to its care providers requiring each provider to provide advance notification to legal services providers and to coordinate with such legal service providers to ensure that attorneys may be present whenever the Department of Homeland Security fingerprints, questions, or interviews an unaccompanied child in ORR custody. Influx Shelters. \u2014The Committee believes the need for influx shelters in fiscal years 2018 and 2019 was due largely to the Ad-ministration's misguided and willfully harmful policies toward un-accompanied children\u2014in particular, the Memorandum of Agree-ment with the Department of Homeland Security and the Adminis-tration's immoral policy of family separation. The Committee strongly supports the medical, psychological, and child welfare ad-vocacy communities in their compelling arguments against, and well-founded reasons to limit, the use of influx shelters, especially large capacity shelters where a substantial number of children re-side in the same room. To eliminate reliance on influx shelters ab-sent such unforeseen circumstances, the Committee directs ORR to ensure sufficient bed capacity for unaccompanied children in per-manent, small, State-licensed shelters and shall in no way delay or otherwise hinder the expeditious placement of unaccompanied chil-dren with qualified sponsors. Information Sharing with EOIR. \u2014The Committee is concerned that ORR is sharing unnecessary case-level information, including biographic data, of individual children with the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) and with DHS, in ways that may dis-suade children from seeking legal relief through due process with their independent legal service providers or may bias the court and unfairly influence issuance and length of continuances. The Com-mittee reminds ORR that they are not qualified to assess a child's eligibility for legal relief and directs ORR to issue guidance to its employees and care providers within 30 days of enactment of this Act prohibiting them from sharing non-essential information con-cerning a child's prospects for family reunification with a court (in-cluding, but not limited to personal records pertaining to the child's stay in ORR custody, including medical or mental health records and behavioral reports; assessments of a child's eligibility for immi-gration relief; or information concerning a potential sponsor's immi-gration status of viability) unless ORR or that care provider is ap-pearing as a party or counsel in a proceeding of record. In-Kind Donations. \u2014The bill continues to include a general pro- vision to allow in-kind donations from the private sector, non-gov-ernmental organizations and other groups to support children in VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, The Committee requests ORR include in future Con- gressional Budget Justifications, information on the use of this pro-vision, including examples of donations that are offered, donations that are accepted, and donations that care providers believe they cannot accept. Legal Services. \u2014The Committee understands that ORR is pre- paring a solicitation for a new contract, commencing in fiscal year 2021, to provide legal services to unaccompanied children. The Committee has significant concerns that some of the requirements under this solicitation run contrary to basic and well-established legal principles and practices, including attorney/client confiden-tiality, ethical standards, and continuity of representation. The Committee directs ORR to ensure that the terms of the next legal services arrangement strictly adhere to these principles and prac-tices. Specifically, the terms shall not require that legal services providers share records or case information, including case assess-ments of legal eligibility determinations, with HHS or any other Federal agency. Further, consistent with a client's right to have on-going and uninterrupted legal counsel through the completion of legal proceedings, the terms shall not include a requirement that representation be terminated upon a child reaching age 18. Such a requirement would be particularly troublesome given the ex-tended length of time currently required for children's proceedings and given the existing USCIS and immigration court backlog. The terms shall not include any requirement that an organization or in-dividual involved in providing legal services sign a non-disclosure agreement. This would interfere with counsel's ability to advocate for their client's interests to the best of their ability and in the strongest possible terms, as they are compelled to do under ethical standards. Finally, funds shall be distributed to organizations pro-viding legal services and advocacy services in a manner that allows for continuity of staffing and services regardless of fluctuations in the number of children in the UAC program over time. Memorandum of Agreement. \u2014The Committee notes that there is clear evidence that the April 13, 2018 Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between ORR and DHS serves as a deterrent to individuals and families willing to sponsor an unaccompanied child. After ORR implemented a series of operational directives to override elements of the MOA, the placement rate improved dramatically, and thou-sands of children were placed with qualified sponsors. Despite these directives, the Committee understands that potential spon-sors still withdraw from the sponsorship process citing a fear of im-migration enforcement. The continuation of the MOA results in longer stays in custody and further traumatizes unaccompanied children. The Committee strongly believes that sponsors will come forward faster if the MOA is terminated. Mental Health Services. \u2014The Committee directs ORR to expand mental health services for children in its custody, including con-tracting with governmental and non-governmental entities while instituting policies that prevent disclosure of this information to immigration enforcement officials. The Committee encourages ORR to continue collaborating with the National Child Traumatic Stress Network in support of trauma-informed care initiatives, including screenings, services, and therapies to children and staff, com-petency trainings for staff, identifying or improving trauma in- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, practices in ORR; and training for sponsors prior to release of children. ORR is directed to keep the Committee informed of ad-ditional resources necessary to support children and their families, as well as staff, who may need additional access to these services, including requests for additional resources from care providers and staff. The Committee requests ORR include in its fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification information on HHS's and grantees' coordination of health and mental health services, includ-ing training requirements for staff providing those services and any challenges to providing adequate care for children and the Depart-ment's progress implementing the recommendations in the Sep-tember 2019 HHS Office of the Inspector General report titled ''Care Provider Facilities Described Challenges Addressing Mental Health Needs of Children in HHS Custody.'' Mental Health Services\u2014Confidentiality. \u2014The Committee notes the critical importance of mental health services and support for unaccompanied children, many of whom have fled persecution, abuse, abandonment, and neglect. The Committee is deeply con-cerned about reports that information provided by children during ORR counseling sessions has been shared with the Department of Homeland Security for use in immigration enforcement. In addi-tion, there are reports that ORR is sharing mental health informa-tion with immigration courts for master calendar hearings, where the court is not making decisions about a child's custody. ORR is directed to refrain from sharing any information with immigration courts for master calendar hearings, where the court is not making any decisions about the child's custody. The Committee further di-rects ORR to develop policies and protocols to ensure the confiden-tiality of counseling and mental health services provided to unac-companied children, and of all related documentation, including case notes and records of therapists and other clinicians, and to in-corporate these policies into the ORR policy guide within 90 days of enactment of this Act. Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP). \u2014The Committee strongly re- jects ICE's decision to remove unaccompanied children from ORR custody while they are pursuing relief under the TVPRA, based on removal orders issued in absentia in connection with prior proc-essing under MPP. Once designated unaccompanied, children should be granted all the protections afforded to them under the TVPRA. The Committee further reiterates its call for the Migrant Protection Protocols to be terminated. The Committee directs ORR to release children to approved sponsors as quickly as possible so they can pursue claims for protection regardless of whether a child, pursuant to his or her prior processing under MPP, has an order of removal. The Committee directs ORR to promptly notify a child's legal service provider (LSP) upon learning that the child may have been previously processed under MPP, and to provide to the LSP any information regarding court proceedings arising from prior processing under MPP. Further, the Committee directs ORR to fa-cilitate routine communication between any such separated chil-dren in ORR custody and family members in the U.S. and in Mex-ico and, where available, to provide the children's attorneys with information pertaining to family members, including their location and contact information. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, Within 30 days of enactment of this Act, and monthly thereafter, the Committee directs ORR to include in its monthly separation re-port to the Committee, and make publicly available in such report online, the number of children separated from parents, legal guard-ians, or other family members in connection with the MPP pro-gram, and the number of children who were previously subject to the MPP policy with their families and subsequently re-entered the U.S. alone and were transferred to ORR as unaccompanied chil-dren. In addition, the Committee directs ACF to conduct an inves-tigation of those unaccompanied children removed by ICE on the basis of removal orders issued while the children were in MPP and to provide the Committee with a report which includes the number of children removed and all steps taken to ensure their safety in home country. Ongoing Separations. \u2014The bill includes a requirement that the Secretary update the Committee, and make publicly available on-line, the number of children referred to ORR's care who have been designated by DHS, or subsequently by HHS case managers, as having been separated (under any circumstances) from the parent or legal guardian with whom they were in DHS custody. The Com-mittee considers the timely reporting of this information to be crit-ical to oversight efforts to make sure that family separation does not occur again. The Committee expects ORR to invest in information technology that will improve the data tracking issues ORR has experienced in recent years, including the functionality necessary to track children who have been separated from families. The Committee requests a briefing within 30 days of enactment of this Act on the status of tools being developed and the protections in place to safeguard sen-sitive UAC and UAC sponsor data. Operational Directives. \u2014The bill includes a general provision prohibiting HHS from reversing several operational directives that improved the sponsor suitability determination process and re-duced the length of time children spend in ORR's custody. The Committee expects HHS to continue to improve child welfare out-comes by reducing time in care and to consider any additional oper-ational directives that can be implemented to release children to suitable sponsors as safely and expeditiously as possible. Protection & Advocacy for Disabled Children. \u2014The Committee believes there must be more robust monitoring of care and treat-ment for unaccompanied alien children with disabilities in ORR funded care provider facilities and encourages ORR to partner with the nationwide network of Protection & Advocacy agencies to en-sure adherence to Federal, State and local codes related to the standards of childcare or the well being of children with disabil-ities. Protection of DNA. \u2014The Committee continues to prohibit any governmental agency or private entity from accessing, using, or storing any genetic material, data, or information collected in this reunification effort, including for the purpose of criminal or immi-gration enforcement. Any genetic material, data, or information ob-tained should be destroyed after testing and the probability of a ge-netic relationship is calculated. The entities conducting DNA test-ing shall obtain the consent of any individual over age 18 prior to testing, and shall make every effort to obtain the consent of a VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, guardian prior to testing anyone under age 18. The Committee re- quests ORR continue to include in its annual Congressional Budget Justification the steps it is taking to protect the privacy and ge-netic material and data of individuals who are being tested as part of reunification efforts. Residential Treatment Centers. \u2014Within 120 days of enactment of this Act, and every six months thereafter, ORR should submit to the Committee a report with the following information: (1) the number of children in residential treatment centers; (2) the length of stay for each child in residential treatment centers and their total length of care; (3) the number of children transferred from other settings to residential treatment; and (4) the documented rea-sons for transfer to residential treatment centers, as documented in a child's ORR file. In addition, not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, ORR shall submit a report to the Com-mittee, and make publicly available in its policy guide, the due process safeguards for children in residential treatment centers. Spend Plan. \u2014The bill includes a general provision requiring the Secretary of HHS to continue to submit a comprehensive spend plan to the Committee every 60 days. The Committee expects the plan to incorporate all funding provided in this Act and in previous Appropriations Acts, including funds provided in the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Humanitarian Assistance and Se-curity at the Southern Border Act, 2019 (P.L. 116-26) and in the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (P.L. 116-94). The plan should continue to include a report on facilities, by facility type, including facility-specific data including number of licensed beds; operating status (open or not yet open); whether a facility is operated by a for-profit or non-profit company; and the availability of such facilities to legal, medical and social service resources. Tender Age Children. \u2014In response to a growing number of ten- der age children in ORR facilities, the Committee expects ORR to expand the use of interventions and lessons learned from context- focused specialists providing early childhood mental health, child trauma, and immigration trauma training to ORR contracted staff. The Committee expects ORR staff, as well as staff in contracted fa-cilities to receive in-person continuing education on these topics at least twice per year. Further, the Committee directs ORR to work with residential care service providers, child welfare experts, and other stakeholders with relevant expertise, to develop policy guide-lines specifically for residential care of tender age children. The Committee directs ORR to include in the fiscal year 2022 Congres-sional Budget Justification information on these efforts, which should include details and metrics on the types of training offered to staff to ensure developmentally appropriate care is available for tender age children. The justification should detail how placement options and services are tailored for tender age children, as well as an assessment of the circumstances under which very young chil-dren are referred to ORR. Video-Teleconferencing Hearings. \u2014The Committee is concerned that video teleconference (VTC) hearings for children have become more frequent during the COVID-19 crisis.The use of VTC for sub-stantive hearings of children is a new practice, one often plagued with technical difficulties and inefficient use of government re-sources. Further, the expedited nature of these dockets for newly- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 children pending release from ORR custody diverts ORR re- sources from critical services for unaccompanied children, as they require transporting children to court on multiple occasions within the space of weeks. These practices alienate children from their legal proceedings and undermine their ability to comprehend the court process and meaning fully participate in their legal defense. The Committee strongly urges ORR to allocate sufficient resources to ensure that legal services providers can mitigate the adverse im-pact that VTC practices have on children, including having a legal services provider presence both in courts and in the child's location for VTC proceedings. Victims of Torture The Committee includes $17,000,000 for the Victims of Torture program, which is $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The program funds non-profit organizations providing healing and support services to refugees, asylees and asylum seekers, who need help overcoming the effects of torture. PAYMENTS TO STATES FOR THE CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $5,826,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 5,826,000,000 ............................................................. 5,926,000,000 Change from ......................................................... +100,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +100,000,000 The Committee recommends $5,926,000,000 for the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) program, which is $100,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The CCDBG provides funds according to a formula to States, territories, and Tribes to provide financial as-sistance to help low-income working families and families engaged in training or education activities access child care and to improve the quality of child care for all children. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $3,500,000,000 to support child care programs, including child care for health care workers and other essential workers. The Committee encourages States to prioritize increasing reim- bursement rates to quality providers and increase the recruitment of quality providers offering care during non-traditional hours. Child Care Facilities Needs Assessment. \u2014The Committee is con- cerned with the learning environment and deterioration of many early child care facilities across the nation, and believes that addi-tional investments may be necessary to address suboptimal health and early learning conditions. The Committee directs ACF to dedi-cate a portion of Federal CCDBG research funding (42 U.S.C. 9858m) towards a feasibility study to determine how a needs as-sessment of child care facilities could best be conducted by States and compiled by ACF to produce a national estimate of facility re-mediation needs and costs. The Committee requests that the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification include an expla-nation for how such a facilities needs assessment could be con-ducted, and the estimated costs for such an assessment. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, BLOCK GRANT Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $1,700,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... - - - Committee Recommendation ............................................................. 1,700,000,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... - - - Change from budget request ...................................................... +1,700,000,000 The Social Services Block Grants provides grants to States by formula. States have the flexibility to determine what services and activities are supported, provided they are targeted at a broad set of goals, including reducing or eliminating poverty, achieving or maintaining self-sufficiency, and preventing neglect, abuse, or ex- ploitation of children and adults. CHILDREN AND FAMILIES SERVICES PROGRAMS Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $12,876,652,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 11,856,130,000 ............................................................. 13,098,181,000 Change from ......................................................... +221,529,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +1,242,051,000 The Children and Families Services programs fund activities serving children, youth, families, the developmentally disabled, Na-tive Americans, victims of child abuse and neglect and domestic vi-olence, and other vulnerable populations. The Committee recommends the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2021 Committee Programs for Children, Youth, and Families: Head ........................ State Child Abuse Prevention ................................................................................................. ..... 20,383,000 Training Vouchers Program Direction .............................................................................................................. ............................. 206,000,000 Head Start The Committee recommends $10,763,095,000 for the Head Start program, which is $150,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Head Start and Early Head Start promote school readiness of children under 5 from low-income families through education, health, social and other services. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $750,000,000 to supplement grants to all Head Start programs, to VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, help them respond to COVID-19 related needs of children and fam- ilies. Cost of Living Adjustment. \u2014The Committee includes $135,000,000 for a cost-of-living adjustment. Tribal Colleges and Universities\u2014Head Start Partnership Pro- gram. \u2014The Committee recommends $4,000,000 for the recently re- established Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCU)\u2014Head Start Partnership Program. Early Head Start (EHS) Expansion and Early Head Start\u2014Child Care (EHS-CC) Partnerships. \u2014The Committee continues to strong- ly support EHS Expansion and EHS-CC Partnerships. The Com-mittee directs ACF to continue to prioritize equally EHS Expansion and EHS-CC Partnerships, as determined by the needs of local communities, and expects that any funds used for EHS Expansion and EHS-CC Partnership grants that are recompeted continue to be used for such purposes. The Committee continues to direct ACF to include in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justifica-tion and each Congressional Budget Justification thereafter, the ac-tual and estimated number of funded slots for each of the following: Head Start, EHS, and EHS-CC Partnerships. Impact of the Federal Poverty Guideline. \u2014The Committee recog- nizes emerging challenges in Head Start's ability to fulfill its pur-pose of serving low-income children and their families as a result of an antiquated federal poverty line. The federal poverty line has not kept pace with the cost of basic living necessities in commu-nities across the country, and as a result an increasing number of families whose income exceeds the federal poverty line experience financial hardship. Many such families would benefit from the services Head Start programs provide but are currently ineligible. The Committee requests a report within 180 days of enactment of this Act, examining how changes in incomes and poverty have im-pacted Head Start eligibility and enrollment among families facing financial hardship given the federal poverty line eligibility require-ment. Migrant and Seasonal Head Start. \u2014The Committee understands that Migrant and Seasonal Head Start (MSHS) is facing unique challenges due to factors outside of the MSHS community's control, and that shifts in funding to accommodate new slots elsewhere in the MSHS network are resulting in individual programs losing funding that is still critically necessary to ensure farmworker fami-lies receive quality services in that program or region. In an effort to address these MSHS program needs without losing opportunities to add slots for MSHS eligible children in parts of the country where such new slots are needed, the bill includes an additional $15,000,000 to supplement funding otherwise available to MSHS programs, which shall be provided with flexibility for the program to address needs for quality improvement. MSHS Eligibility Requirements. \u2014The Committee recognizes that a child's eligibility for MSHS is contingent upon a family living below the federal poverty line and a requirement that more than 50 percent of the family's income be derived from agricultural work. In spite of the fact that MSHS parents are working and mak-ing significant contributions to the nation's agricultural industry and economy, many farmworker families struggle to meet basic needs even if their incomes are at or above the federal poverty line. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, As part of the Impact of the Federal Poverty Guideline report re- quested above, the Committee requests ACF include a separate sec-tion examining how enrollment and eligibility requirements for the MSHS program may act as barriers for low-income farmworker families seeking MSHS services and possible solutions to expand-ing access to such families. Preschool Development Grants The Committee recommends $300,000,000 for Preschool Develop- ment Grants, which is $25,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 en-acted level and $300,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget re-quest. This program provides grants to States to build State and local capacity to provide preschool for 4-year-olds from low-and moderate-income families. Runaway and Homeless Youth The Committee recommends $140,000,000 for the Runaway and Homeless Youth (RHY) program, which is $7,579,000 above the fis-cal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $25,000,000 for services for runaway and homeless youth. The Committee supports the ability of grantees to provide pre- vention services, such as counseling and case management, regard-less of enrollment in residential services. The program is encour-aged to notify applicants if grant applications were successful at least 30 days before the grant is to begin, or no less than 30 days before an existing grant is set to end. The Committee strongly urges the program to ensure that service delivery and staff training comprehensively address the individual strengths and needs of youth, as well as be language appropriate, gender appropriate (interventions that are sensitive to the diverse experiences of male, female, and transgender youth and consistent with the gender identity of participating youth), and culturally sen-sitive and respectful of the complex social identities of youth (i.e., race, ethnicity, nationality, age, religion/spirituality, gender iden-tity/expression, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, physical or cognitive ability, language, beliefs, values, behavior patterns, or customs). The Committee strongly believes that no runaway youth or homeless youth should be excluded from participation in, be de-nied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under, any pro-gram or activity funded in whole or in part under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, based on any of the conditions outlined in this paragraph. State Child Abuse Prevention The Committee recommends $92,591,000 for Child Abuse Pre- vention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) State Grants, which is $2,500,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The Committee is aware that States have failed to respond to re- quests for public disclosure of information, or provided incomplete information in response to such requests, regarding cases of child abuse or neglect which result in a child fatality or near fatality as required by Section 106(b)(2)(B)(x) of CAPTA. The Committee di-rects the Children's Bureau to remind States that they must com- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, 106(b)(2)(B)(x) of CAPTA to be eligible for the CAPTA State Grant program. The Committee directs the Chil-dren's Bureau to review plans submitted by the states to comply with Section 106(b)(2)(B)(x). The Committee directs the Children's Bureau to establish a uniform standard for tracking and reporting child fatalities and near fatalities related to child maltreatment and to take steps to create an electronic system for States to track and report such data as required. The Children's Bureau shall re-port back to the Committee within 180 days of enactment of this Act on the Bureau's plan to develop a uniform standard and to im-plement an electronic reporting system, how the Bureau will en-sure compliance in the future, and recommendations for the Com-mittee to facilitate compliance. Child Abuse Discretionary Activities The Committee recommends $37,500,000 for Child Abuse Discre- tionary Activities, which is $2,500,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. Child Abuse Hotline. \u2014The Committee includes $1,000,000 to support an additional year of the National Child Abuse Hotline in-novation grant to develop and research text- and online chat-based intervention and education services through a national child abuse hotline. The Committee encourages ACF to continue evaluating and sharing text and chat best practices in appropriate communica-tion, identity verification, privacy protection, and resource sharing with the other national hotlines. Crisis Nurseries. \u2014The Committee believes that crisis nurseries can provide a vital family preservation service, effectively sup-porting children and families by providing emergency shelter and direct care services for children, and providing critical support for parents treating their own substance use, mental, and physical health issues. The Committee urges ACF to engage with existing crisis nurseries, as well as interested parties who want to open nurseries, to coordinate a conversation on national standards for quality care and potential best practices. National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS). \u2014The Committee notes the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data Sys-tem (NCANDS) was established in response to the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of 1988. NCANDS is a voluntary data collection system that gathers information from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico about reports of child abuse and neglect. In light of the acknowledged close relationship between child maltreatment and animal abuse, and with exposure to animal abuse considered an Adverse Childhood Event (ACE), the Committee encourages HHS to explore the feasibility of including a category of animal abuse to caregiver characteristics and environ-mental factors that may place the child at risk for maltreatment. Trauma-Informed Interventions. \u2014The Committee includes $2,500,000 for a demonstration project related to the implementa-tion of a new and innovative approach to serving children providing trauma-informed interventions. Eligible applicants should be non-profit organizations with a demonstrated experience working with children who have experienced severe trauma caused by abuse or neglect. Applicants are expected to partner with a regional chil-dren's hospital and shall include Institutional Review Board-ap- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul supported by content area and epidemiological ex- perts. The project should report regularly on findings, outcomes, and retention rates, including recommendations regarding sustain-able funding and replicable components. Community-Based Child Abuse Prevention The Committee recommends $63,160,000 for Community-Based Child Abuse Prevention, which is $7,500,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. These formula grants support community-based approaches to child abuse and neglect prevention. Social Services Research and Demonstration The Committee recommends $7,512,000 for Social Services and Income Maintenance Research, which is $500,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Child Welfare Intergenerational Poverty Study. \u2014The Committee directs $1,000,000 for the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences to provide an evidence- based analysis of and recommendations for policies and programs to reduce intergenerational poverty and improve child welfare. This study should include, but not be limited to: the correlates and causes of the perpetuation of poverty from childhood into adult-hood; the racial disparities and structural factors that contribute to this cycle; the effects of major assistance, intervention, and edu-cation programs on intergenerational poverty; identify policies and programs that have the potential to significantly reduce the effects of intergenerational poverty; and identify key, high-priority gaps in the research needed to help develop effective policies for reducing intergenerational poverty in the United States. Native American Programs The Committee recommends $60,000,000 for Native American Programs, which is $3,950,000 above fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $2,725,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. These programs assist Tribal and village governments and Native Amer-ican institutions and organizations in their efforts to support and develop stable, diversified local economies. Tribes and non-profit or-ganizations use funds to develop and implement sustainable com-munity-based social and economic programs and services to im-prove the well-being of Native people. The Committee recommends an additional $2,450,000 over the fiscal year 2020 enacted level for Social and Economic Development Strategies (SEDS) grants. These competitive financial assistance grants support locally determined projects designed to reduce or eliminate community problems and achieve community goals. Within the total, the recommendation includes no less than $15,000,000 for Native American language preservation activities, including not less than $6,000,000 for language immersion pro-grams as authorized by section 803C(b)(7)(A)-(C) of the Native American Programs Act, as amended by the Esther Martinez Na-tive American Language Preservation Act of 2006. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, Programs Community Services Block Grant. \u2014The Committee recommends $750,000,000 for the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG), which is $10,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $750,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The CSBG provides funds to alleviate the causes and conditions of pov-erty in communities. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) in-cluded $1,000,000,000 for supplemental community services in re-sponse to the coronavirus pandemic. The Committee is concerned by reports that States may not be disbursing CSBG funding to local grantees in a timely manner, and requests the program brief the Committee within 90 days of enact-ment of this Act, on any States that are unable to distribute CSBG funding to local entities within 30 days of receiving funding. Community Economic Development. \u2014The Committee rec- ommends $20,383,000 for Community Economic Development, which is equal to the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $20,383,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Community Economic Development is a grant program, which funds Commu-nity Development Corporations seeking to address the economic needs of low-income individuals and families through the creation of sustainable business development and employment opportuni-ties. The Committee is concerned that the program may be consid- ering changes to procedures regarding the disposition of intangible assets and program income acquired with, and program income de-rived from, CED grants. The Committee urges the program to con-sider the impact any such changes would have on the possibility of leveraging other financing sources in the future, and to brief the Committee prior to making any changes being considered. Rural Community Facilities Development. \u2014The Committee rec- ommends $10,000,000 for the Rural Community Facilities Develop-ment program, which is equal to the fiscal year 2020 enacted level, and $10,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Rural Community Development is a grant program that works with re-gional and Tribal organizations to manage safe water systems in rural communities. Within 120 days of enactment of this Act, the Committee re- quests a report of Rural Community Facilities Development projects supported by Rural Community Development (RCD) grants in fiscal year 2019 and 2020. The report should identify which projects are in persistent poverty areas, which shall be defined as (1) any county that has had 20 percent or more of its population living in poverty over the past 30 years, as measured by the 1990 and 2000 decennial censuses and the most recent Small Area In-come and Poverty Estimates published by the Census Bureau. In addition, the report should identify which projects are in high-pov-erty areas, where the term high-poverty area should mean any county or Tribal census tract with a poverty rate of at least 20 per-cent as measured by the 2014-2018 5-year data series available from the American Community Survey of the Census Bureau. The Committee requests the RCD program, as part of its fiscal year 2021 grant continuation application process, instruct grantees to collect and report time and costs associated with work supporting projects in persistent and high-poverty areas. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul The Committee recommends $14,000,000 for the Domestic Vio- lence Hotline, which is $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 en-acted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The Hotline provides 24-hour, toll-free and confidential services immediately connecting callers to local service providers. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $2,000,000 to expand the hotline's capacity during the coronavirus pandemic. Family Violence Prevention and Battered Women's Shelters The Committee recommends $185,000,000 for the Family Vio- lence Prevention and Battered Women's Shelters programs, which is $10,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fis-cal year 2021 budget request. The Family Violence Prevention and Services Act programs provide funding to support the prevention of incidents of family violence, domestic violence, and dating violence, and provide the immediate shelter and supportive services for adult and youth victims (and their dependents). In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $45,000,000 for the program to expand capacity to provide temporary housing and assistance to victims of family, domestic, and dating violence. The Committee strongly supports the expertise, training, and support that Domestic Violence Resource Network resource centers provide to survivors of partner violence across the country and rec-ognizes that LGBTQ communities face many unique barriers to ac-cessing culturally competent support. The Committee understands funding for several resource centers may be expiring at the end of this fiscal year. The Committee includes funding to continue con-tracts for resource centers that support underserved populations and directs ACF to maintain funding to support resource centers serving the LGBTQ community at no less than the level provided in fiscal year 2020. Program Direction The Committee recommends $206,000,000 for Program Direction, which is equal to the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. Member of Congress Letters of Support. \u2014The Committee requests a report within 90 days of enactment of this Act discussing the process by which ACF evaluates a letter of support by a Member of Congress in competitive grant applications. Status of Funds. \u2014The Committee requests ACF provide the quarterly status of balances report, as required in Section 524 of the bill, at the account and program level of detail displayed in the table at the end of this report. PROMOTING SAFE AND STABLE FAMILIES Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $437,515,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 404,765,000 ............................................................. 404,765,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... \u00a532,750,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - The Committee recommends $345,000,000 in mandatory funds and $59,765,000 in discretionary funds for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program. This program enables each State to oper-ate a coordinated program of family preservation services, commu- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul time-limited reunification serv- ices, and adoption promotion and support services. States receive funds based on their share of children in all States receiving food stamp benefits. PAYMENTS FOR FOSTER CARE AND PERMANENCY Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $5,744,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 7,011,538,000 ............................................................. 7,011,538,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +1,267,538,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - The Committee also recommends an advance appropriation of $3,000,000,000 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 to ensure timely completion of first quarter grant awards. Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS) Data Elements. \u2014The Committee is very disappointed that HHS finalized rulemaking removing LGBTQ and Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) data from AFCARS. Abandoning data collec-tion on LGBTQ foster youth, parents, and guardians is a clear sign that HHS is abdicating its statutory responsibilities to promote the well-being, safety, and permanency of LGBTQ foster youth by lim-iting the ability to track and improve these outcomes for LGBTQ foster youth, as well as to track recruitment of LGBTQ foster and adoptive parents in an effort to provide diverse family placements for diverse foster youth. Similarly, removing many ICWA data ele-ments is a sign that HHS is abdicating its statutory and federal trust responsibilities to protect the best interests of tribal children, to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and families, and to monitor State implementation of the ICWA in order to budg-et, plan, and target needed training and technical assistance to support states to meet federal law. LGBTQ and ICWA data ele-ments are especially critical for tracking and improving outcomes for foster youth and families living at the intersections of race, sex-ual orientation, gender, and tribal affiliation, particularly LGBTQ tribal foster youth and families. A DMINISTRATION FOR COMMUNITY LIVING AGING AND DISABILITY SERVICES PROGRAMS Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $2,171,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 2,072,092,000 ............................................................. 2,225,390,000 Change from ......................................................... +54,390,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +153,298,000 Created in 2012, the Administration for Community Living (ACL) brings together the efforts and achievements of the Adminis-tration on Aging, the Administration on Intellectual and Develop-mental Disabilities, and the HHS Office on Disability to serve as the Federal agency responsible for increasing access to community supports, while focusing attention and resources on the unique needs of older Americans and people with disabilities across the lifespan. In addition, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (P.L. 116-127) included $250,000,000 and the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $955,000,000 to provide millions of additional home-deliv-ered and prepackaged meals, supplemental home and community- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul supportive services, support for the long-term care ombuds- man, and supplemental family caregiver support services; to ex-pand capacity at Aging and Disability Resource Centers; and to ex-pand capacity at Centers for Independent Living. The Committee continues to fund the Senior Medicare Patrol Program through the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Ac-count. Home and Community-Based Supportive Services The Committee recommends $400,074,000 for Home and Commu- nity-Based Supportive Services, which is $10,000,000 above the fis-cal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This program provides formula grants to States and territories to fund a wide range of social services that enable seniors to remain independent in their homes for as long as possible. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $200,000,000 to provide supplemental home and community-based supportive services during the coronavirus pandemic. Preventive Health Services The Committee recommends $24,848,000 for Preventive Health Services, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This program funds activi-ties that help seniors remain healthy and avoid chronic diseases. Protection of Vulnerable Older Americans The Committee recommends $24,658,000 for activities to protect vulnerable older Americans, which is $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $4,030,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. These programs provide grants to States for protec-tion of vulnerable older Americans through the Long-Term Care Ombudsman and Prevention of Elder Abuse and Neglect programs. The recommendation directs an additional $2,000,000 to State Long-Term Care Ombudsman Programs. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $20,000,000 for the long-term care ombudsman program, during the coronavirus pandemic. Family Caregiver Support Services The Committee recommends $193,936,000 for the National Care- giver Support program, which is $8,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $43,350,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This program offers a range of support services to family caregivers, including assistance in accessing services such as respite care, counseling, support groups, and caregiver training. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $100,000,000 to provide supplemental caregiver support services during the coronavirus pandemic. Youth Caregivers. \u2014The Committee recognizes the significant barriers and lack of support youth caregivers face, and urges ACL and its Family Caregiving Advisory Council to consider the needs of youth caregivers in the development and execution of its na-tional family caregiving strategy. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Caregiver Support Services The Committee recommends $12,306,000 for the Native Amer- ican Caregiver Support program, which is $2,000,000 above the fis-cal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This program provides grants to Tribes for the support of American Indian, Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian families caring for older relatives with chronic illness or disabilities. Congregate and Home-Delivered Nutrition Services The Committee recommends a total of $956,753,000 for senior nutrition. The recommendation includes: $520,342,000 for Con-gregate Nutrition Services, which is $10,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request; $276,342,000 for Home-Delivered Meal Services, which is $10,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request; and $160,069,000 for the Nutrition Serv-ices Incentives program, which is equal to the fiscal year 2020 en-acted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. In addition, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (P.L. 116-127) and the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $240,000,000 and $480,000,000, respectively, to provide millions of additional home-delivered and prepackaged meals, as well as related services, during the coronavirus pandemic. These programs help older Amer-icans remain healthy and independent in their communities by pro-viding meals and related services in a variety of settings (including congregate facilities such as senior centers) and via home-delivery to older adults who are homebound due to illness, disability, or geo-graphic isolation. Malnutrition. \u2014The Committee is concerned that older adults homebound during the COVID-19 pandemic may not have regular access to food, putting them at increased risk of malnutrition. The Committee understands that malnutrition screening was included as a defined disease prevention and health promotion service in the recent Older Americans Act (OAA) reauthorization, and expects programs to ensure that they are using proper nutrition risk screening tools that capture people at risk for, or that have mal-nutrition, as part of regular nutrition screening. Nutrition Guidelines for Older Adults. \u2014The Committee is con- cerned that GAO's December 2019 report on ''Nutrition Assistance Programs: Agencies Could Do More to Help Address the Nutri-tional Needs of Older Adults'' found Federal nutrition guidelines do not focus on the needs of many older adults, such as those with common health conditions and those over age 70. The Committee expects the Administrator of ACL to continue working with other relevant HHS officials and to document a plan to focus on the spe-cific nutritional needs of older adults in the 2025-2030 update of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The Committee recommends ACL take steps to ensure States demonstrate that they are moni-toring providers to ensure meal consistency with Federal nutrition requirements for meals served in congregate and home-delivered meal programs. Finally, the Committee directs ACL to centralize and make publicly available information on promising approaches for making meal accommodations to meet the nutritional needs of older adult participants in the congregate and home-delivered meal programs. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul American Nutrition and Supportive Services The Committee recommends $37,208,000 for Native American Nutrition and Supportive Services, which is $2,500,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget re-quest. This program provides grants to Tribes to promote the deliv-ery of nutrition and home and community-based supportive serv-ices to Native American, Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian el-ders. In addition, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (P.L. 116-127) and the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $10,000,000 and $20,000,000, respectively, to provide additional home-delivered and prepackaged meals, as well as related services, during the coronavirus pandemic. Aging Network Support Activities The Committee recommends $12,461,000 for Aging Network Sup- port Activities, which is equal to the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $958,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This pro-gram supports activities that expand public understanding of aging and the aging process. Holocaust Survivor's Assistance. \u2014The Committee continues to provide not less than $5,000,000 for the Holocaust Survivor's As-sistance program. This program provides supportive services for aging Holocaust survivors living in the U.S. Care Corps. \u2014The Committee recognizes the growing demand for services and supports to help seniors and individuals with disabil-ities live independently in their homes, and the need to support family caregivers who facilitate that independence. Within 120 days of enactment of this Act, the Committee requests ACL provide a briefing on the status and benefits of the Care Corps grant pro-gram, which places volunteers in communities to assist family care-givers and/or assist seniors and individuals with disabilities in maintaining independence by providing non-medical care. Data Collection on Needs of LGBT Older Adults. \u2014The Com- mittee understands that while the definition of ''greatest social need'' under the Older Americans Act of 1965 includes isolation caused by racial or ethnic status, it notes that the definition is not intended to exclude the targeting of other populations that experi-ence cultural, social, or geographic isolation due to other factors. The Committee supports ACL's recognition that such isolation may be caused by minority religious affiliation, sexual orientation, or gender identity, which may restrict a person's ability to perform normal daily tasks or live independently. The Committee directs ACL to ensure that the needs of such populations are being met by the aging services network through targeted outreach and pro-gramming. Specifically, and within 120 days of enactment of this Act, the Committee directs ACL to collect and publish data from the aging services network on how the needs of such populations are being met, including: (1) the unique needs of lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, and transgender (LGBT) older adults; (2) how the aging service network is meeting these needs; and (3) what gaps exist in the provision of aging services to this population. National Technical Assistance Center on Grandfamilies. \u2014The Committee recognizes that more than 2.5 million children are being raised in grandfamilies without the child's parents in the home, VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, with the vast majority of these families raising children outside of the formal foster care system and lacking access to needed informa-tion, services or supports to help them care for the children. The Committee encourages ACL to work with the Advisory Council to Support Grandparents Raising Grandchildren and with ACF, to co- ordinate the establishment of a Technical Assistance Center on Grandfamilies to provide information, resources and individualized technical assistance and support to help State, tribal, and local agencies and non-profit organizations use model practices and pro-grams for serving children, parents and caregivers in grandfamilies, including those impacted by parental substance use. Alzheimer's Disease Program The Committee recommends $26,500,000 for the Alzheimer's dis- ease program, which is equal to the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This program provides competitive matching grants to a limited number of States to en-courage program innovation and coordination of public and private services for people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. The Committee continues to support efforts to increase respite care services for family members and caregivers supporting individuals living with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias. Respite Care The Committee recommends $10,000,000 for Respite Care, which is $3,890,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $6,640,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The program focuses on easing the burdens of caregiving by providing grants to eligible State organizations to improve the quality of, and access to, respite care for family caregivers. Falls Prevention The Committee recommends $5,000,000 to be transferred from the PPH Fund to ACL for the Falls Prevention program, which is equal to the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Falls prevention grants sup-port the promotion and dissemination of prevention tools delivered in community settings. Chronic Disease Self-Management Program The Committee recommends $8,000,000 to be transferred from the PPH Fund to ACL for the Chronic Disease Self-Management program, which is equal to the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $8,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This program supports grants to States for low-cost, evidence-based prevention models that use state-of-the-art techniques to help those with chronic conditions address issues related to the management of their disease. Elder Rights Support Activities The Committee recommends $17,874,000 for Elder Rights Sup- port Activities, which is $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 en-acted level and equal to the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This program supports efforts that provide information, training, and VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, assistance to legal and aging services organizations work- ing to prevent and detect elder abuse and neglect. The Committee encourages ACL to lead efforts to develop a co- ordinated and consistent approach to Adult Protective Services (APS) through development of an APS National Data System. The Committee recognizes that the opioid crisis is affecting adult pro-tective services, but believes this work should be done as part of increased screening efforts, which should be prioritized in order to reduce elder abuse, neglect and exploitation. Guardianship Systems. \u2014The recommendation includes $2,000,000 for grants to address problems in State guardianship laws and procedures that lead to the unnecessary loss of rights and incidence of abuse as authorized under Section 2042(c)(3) of the So-cial Security Act. Grant awards should be provided for at least a 5-year award period. The Committee encourages ACL to support State efforts to examine their guardianship systems through na-tionally coordinated initiatives such as WINGS (Working Inter-disciplinary Networks of Guardianship Stakeholders), which have been particularly valuable. Additional national coordination efforts should include: facilitating information sharing between State WINGS via in person convenings, remote access, and dissemination of materials; technical assistance to State WINGS or similar groups; and support for data collection and analysis. Aging and Disability Resource Centers The Committee recommends $8,119,000 for Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs), which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budg-et request. These centers provide information, counseling and ac-cess for individuals to learn about the services and support options available to seniors and the disabled so they may retain their inde-pendence. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $50,000,000 to expand capacity at Aging and Disability Resource Centers dur-ing the coronavirus pandemic. Integrated Wellness in Supportive Housing. \u2014The Committee sup- ports the continued collaboration between HHS and the Depart-ment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on research ini-tiatives to inform the design of the Supportive Services Demonstra-tion for Elderly Households in HUD Assisted Multifamily Housing. The Committee recognizes that ADRCs support efforts to develop more efficient, cost-effective, and consumer-responsive systems, and believes that they can play an important role in evaluating the In-tegrated Wellness in Supportive Housing (IWISH) demonstration. The Committee strongly urges the ADRCs to continue to collabo-rate with HUD to evaluate the effectiveness of the IWISH project, including its potential for expansion and its cost-savings implica-tions for the healthcare system. State Health Insurance Assistance Program The Committee recommends $54,115,000 for the State Health In- surance Assistance Program, which is $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $18,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The State Health Insurance Assistance Program VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, provides Medicare beneficiaries with information, counseling, and enrollment assistance. Paralysis Resource Center The Committee recommends $9,700,000 for the Paralysis Re- source Center (PRC), and directs not less than $8,700,000 to the National PRC. The Paralysis Resource Center offers activities and services aimed at increasing independent living for people with pa-ralysis and related mobility impairments, and supporting integra-tion into the physical and cultural communities in which they live. The Committee is concerned that PRC State Pilot Programs may be duplicative of similar grantmaking efforts at the federal level. Within 120 days of enactment of this Act, the Committee requests an assessment of the effectiveness of the State Pilot Programs in meeting funding or programmatic needs not already met by the National PRC. Limb Loss Resource Center The Committee recommends $4,000,000 for the Limb Loss Re- source Center, which is equal to the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The Limb Loss Resource Center supports a variety of programs and services for those living with limb loss, including a national peer support program, edu-cational events, training for consumers and healthcare profes-sionals, and information and referral services. In addition, the Cen-ter supports our Veterans and Wounded Warriors through VA and DOD partnerships and volunteer programs, and disseminates over 20,000 patient education materials created by the program to pro-mote recovery and reintegration, improve health and enhance well- being and rehabilitation through a national network of profes-sionals and support groups. Traumatic Brain Injury The Committee recommends $11,321,000 for the Traumatic Brain Injury program, which is equal to the fiscal year 2020 en-acted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The program provides grants to States for the development of a comprehensive, coordinated family and person-centered service system at the State and community level for individuals who sustain a traumatic brain injury. Developmental Disabilities State Councils The Committee recommends $80,000,000 for State Councils on Developmental Disabilities, which is $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $24,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The Developmental Disabilities State Councils work to develop, improve and expand the system of services and supports for people with developmental disabilities. The Committee recommends not less than $700,000 for technical assistance and training for the State Councils on Developmental Disabilities, and requests that ACL report back to the Committee within 90 days of enactment of this Act on implementation of this language. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, Disabilities Protection and Advocacy The Committee recommends $41,784,000 for Developmental Dis- abilities Protection and Advocacy, which is $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $3,050,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This formula grant program provides funding to States to establish and maintain protection and advocacy sys-tems to protect the legal rights of persons with developmental dis-abilities. Voting Access for Individuals with Disabilities The Committee recommends $8,463,000 for Voting Access for In- dividuals with Disabilities program, which is $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget re-quest. The Voting Access for Individuals with Disabilities program authorized by the Help America Vote Act provides formula grants to ensure full participation in the electoral process for individuals with disabilities, including registering to vote, accessing polling places, and casting a vote. Developmental Disabilities Projects of National Significance The Committee recommends $12,250,000 for Developmental Dis- abilities Projects of National Significance, which is equal to the fis-cal year 2020 enacted level and $11,200,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This program funds grants and contracts that develop new technologies and demonstrate innovative methods to support the independence, productivity, and integration of those living with a disability into the community. University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities The Committee recommends $41,619,000 for University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities, which is equal to the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $9,073,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The University Centers for Excellence in De-velopmental Disabilities Education, Research, and Service are a na-tionwide network of independent but interlinked centers, rep-resenting a national resource for addressing issues, finding solu-tions, and advancing research related to the needs of individuals with developmental disabilities and their families. Independent Living The Committee recommends $116,183,000 for the Independent Living program, of which $25,378,000 is for the Independent Living State Grants program and $90,805,000 is for the Centers for Inde-pendent Living program. This funding level is equal to the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $2,537,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Independent Living programs maximize the leader-ship, empowerment, independence, and productivity of individuals with disabilities. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $85,000,000 to expand capacity at Centers for Independent Living during the coronavirus pandemic. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabili- tation Research The Committee recommends $111,970,000 for the National Insti- tute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Re-search (NIDILRR), which is equal to the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $21,599,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. NIDILRR generates knowledge and promotes its effective use to enhance the abilities of people with disabilities to perform activities of their choice in the community and to expand society's capacity to provide full opportunities for its citizens with disabilities. Assistive Technology The Committee recommends $37,000,000 for Assistive Tech- nology, which is equal to the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $5,061,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Assistive Technology (AT) supports programs providing grants to States for addressing assistive technology needs of individuals with disabil-ities. The goal is to increase awareness of and access to assistive technology devices and services that may help with education, em-ployment, daily activities, and inclusion of people with disabilities in their communities. The Committee continues to provide $2,000,000 for competitive grants to support existing and new alternative financing programs that provide for the purchase of AT devices. Program Administration The Committee recommends $41,063,000 for Program Adminis- tration, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. This funding supports Federal administrative costs associated with administering ACL's programs. Telehealth Training and Education for Medicare Beneficiaries. \u2014 The Committee recognizes the potential for telehealth, remote mon-itoring, and digital health technologies to help meet the needs of patients and families across the country. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress expanded access to telehealth serv-ices by providing the Secretary with the authority to waive long-standing restrictions on Medicare telehealth services for the dura-tion of the public health emergency. The Committee is aware that as healthcare providers have sought to deliver virtual care at scale, some beneficiaries and caregivers are in need of training and edu-cation on how to interact with providers prior to a telehealth visit. To address this issue, the Committee directs ACL to work with CMS and other stakeholders to develop education and training re-sources that account for age-related differences in how beneficiaries interact with technology. The Committee directs ACL to submit a report within 60 days of enactment of this Act, evaluating current telehealth training and education programs, and provide additional recommendations on how to improve beneficiary utilization and ac-cess to synchronous and asynchronous Medicare telehealth serv-ices. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY MEDICARE HEARINGS AND APPEALS Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $191,881,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 196,381,000 Committee Recommendation ............................................................. 191,881,000 Change from enacted level ................................................................ - - - Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a54,500,000 This activity supports hearings at the administrative law judge level, the third level of Medicare claims appeals. Medicare Appeals Backlog. \u2014The Committee continues bill lan- guage included in fiscal year 2020 to provide flexibility for the De-partment to address backlogs of appeals hearings, as well as retain and recruit Administrative Law Judges. GENERAL DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $544,457,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 420,945,000 ............................................................. 524,787,000 Change from ......................................................... \u00a519,670,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +103,842,000 Of the funds provided, $64,828,000 shall be derived from evalua- tion set-aside funds available under section 241 of the Public Health Service Act, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 en-acted level and $9,012,000 below the fiscal year 2021 budget re-quest. This appropriation supports activities that are associated with the Secretary's roles as policy officer and general manager of the Department of Health and Human Services. The Office of the Sec-retary also implements administration and Congressional direc-tives, and provides assistance, direction and coordination to the headquarters, regions, and field organizations of the department. In addition, this funding supports the Office of the Surgeon Gen-eral and several other health promotion and disease prevention ac-tivities that are centrally administered. Advertising Contracts. \u2014The Committee understands that, as the largest advertiser in the United States, the federal government should work to ensure fair access to its advertising contracts for small disadvantaged businesses and businesses owned by minori-ties and women. The Committee directs each department and agen-cy to include the following information in its fiscal year 2022 budg-et justification: Expenditures for fiscal year 2020 and expected ex-penditures for fiscal year 2021 and 2022, respectively, for (1) all contracts for advertising services; and (2) contracts for the adver-tising services of (I) socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses concerns (as defined in section 8(a)(4) of the Small Busi-ness Act (15 U.S.C. 637 (a)(4)); and (II) women-and minority-owned businesses. Awareness of Sickle Cell Trait. \u2014The Committee supports the ef- forts to provide Americans with screening for sickle cell trait, a known health disparity among African Americans and Hispanic/ Latino Americans. The Committee urges the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in collaboration with NIH and CDC, to sub- mit an action plan within 180 days of enactment of this Act to ad-dress the lack of awareness of sickle cell trait and the prevalence of testing for sickle cell trait. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, is aware of research indi- cating that individuals and families suffer severe health, social, and economic declines following the death of a loved one\u2014be it a child, sibling, spouse, or parent. The Committee encourages CMS, SAMHSA, HRSA, IHS, CDC, NIH, ACF, OMH and OWH to exam-ine their involvement in activities to advance bereavement care for families, including documenting and investigating the policies or programs that help or hinder functional coping or adaptive proc-essing and the prevalence and outcome of bereavement events (what relationships are impacted, how the loved one died and their age, risk factors and associated health events or outcomes, and bio-logical or physiological changes in well-being.). Blood Banks. \u2014The Committee supports the Secretary's decision to allow blood banks to provide blood donors with COVID-19 anti-body testing, and thus directs HHS to continue to allow this activ-ity which benefits blood donors and provides state and local govern-mental entities with valuable data. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Advisory Committee. \u2014The Committee looks forward to reviewing HHS's plan regarding myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) as requested in House Report 116-62. In the interim, the Committee encourages HHS to foster interagency and stakeholder collaboration in ad-dressing the crisis in ME/CFS clinical care and accelerating drug development for ME/CFS. Chronic Pain. \u2014The Committee remains concerned about the public health epidemic of acute and chronic pain, including its interrelationship with the opioid crisis. The Committee is pleased with the release of the HHS Pain Management Best Practices Inter-Agency Task Force Report in May 2019, but remains con-cerned over delayed dissemination and implementation of the Re-port's recommendations. A strategic plan to disseminate the report and implement recommendations is needed, and the Committee strongly encourages the Department to widely disseminate the Re-port to health care providers and other public health stakeholders, and to update relevant pain management policies and educational tools to reflect Task Force recommended best practices across all relevant HHS agencies, including the CDC, CMS, SAMHSA and other relevant agencies. The Committee also urges the Department to coordinate with the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs to launch a public awareness campaign to educate Americans about acute and chronic pain and the evidence based non-opioid treat-ment options that are available, including non-opioid medications; interventional procedures such as nerve blocks, injections and sur-gical devices; behavioral health approaches such as cognitive be-havioral therapy; and complementary and integrative health thera-pies such as massage therapy and acupuncture. Coordination of Vector-Borne Disease Control. \u2014The Committee urges the Secretary to establish a coordinating office to facilitate and expedite the government's response to vector-borne disease threats, including combating the spread of disease through innova-tive vector control technologies, as well as provide a valuable re-source to scientific investigators, health professionals and the gen-eral public. The coordinating office should improve communication, collaboration, and transparency across numerous agencies engaged in various facets of vector-borne disease research and control, in- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, CDC, FDA, NIH, and BARDA. The coordinating office should also establish communication, collaboration, and trans-parency with non-HHS agencies, including USDA, USAID, DoD, Homeland Security, and Veterans Affairs. Customer Service. \u2014The Committee continues to support efforts to improve customer service in accordance with Executive Order 13571\u2014Streamlining Service Delivery and Improving Customer Service. The Committee directs the Secretary to develop standards to improve customer service and incorporate the standards into the performance plans required under 31 U.S.C. 1115. The Committee further directs the Department to include an update on the progress of these efforts in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification. Dataset of Payments from the Provider Relief Fund. \u2014The Sec- retary shall continue to maintain the online reporting dataset of all payments from the Provider Relief Fund. The dataset, which is hosted by CDC with data provided by HRSA, shall remain publicly available in a searchable, electronic format, through fiscal year 2021. Data Science. \u2014The Committee supports the use of operations re- search and analytics to inform decision-making and enable agen-cies to improve the development and execution of federal programs, more accurately assess their implementation, and reduce waste, fraud and abuse. The Committee requests a report within 120 days outlining how the Department utilizes data scientists and oper-ations research analysts, including how many personnel are em-ployed in these positions and the roles they fill in the Department. Diverse Participation in COVID-19 Vaccine Development. \u2014The Committee is concerned that demographic data on COVID-19 vac-cine clinical trial participants are not being collected and reported, which could impede efforts to ensure that eventual COVID-19 vac-cines are safe and effective for the entire U.S. population. The Committee directs the Secretary to require the collection and re-porting of all relevant demographic data on COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial participants, including data on age, sex, race, and eth-nicity. The Committee directs the Secretary, in consultation with relevant agencies within HHS\u2014including FDA, NIH, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, Office of Minority Health, and Office on Women's Health\u2014to submit a re-port to the Committee within 90 days of enactment of this Act on the specific steps the Department is taking to ensure that ongoing and upcoming COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials have diverse and representative participation of historically underrepresented sub-groups, including by age, sex, race, ethnicity, and women who are pregnant or lactating. Evidence-based Grants and Policy. \u2014The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification on implementation of the Foundations for Evidence-based Policy- making Act (P.L. 115-435) and implementation plans for the com-ing year. The Committee encourages the Secretary to develop guid-ance to ensure relevant participants and grantees are involved in the Department-wide process of prioritizing evidence needs, includ-ing participating in Department-led evaluations. Consistent with program statutes, the Committee encourages the Secretary to en- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, sure that evidence of effectiveness is a consideration in grant op- portunities. Global Health Research. \u2014The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2022 congressional budget justification outlining how CDC, FDA, BARDA, and NIH, including the Fogarty Inter-national Center, jointly coordinate global health research activities with specific measurable metrics used to track progress and col-laboration toward agreed upon health goals. Grants Policy. \u2014The Committee understands Departmental grant guidance makes clear that directives contained in a House, Senate, or Conference report or explanatory statement accompanying an appropriations act should be incorporated into funding opportunity announcements as appropriate. However, the Committee is aware of instances of funding announcements in the past fiscal year fail-ing to address language applicable in a fiscal year 2020 report or statement. The Committee requests a briefing from the Office of Grants within 90 days of enactment of this Act on the process for addressing report or statement language. Health Impact Assessments. \u2014The Committee believes there is an opportunity to use health impact assessments and other related ap-proaches in the federal government to raise awareness of the po-tential health consequences of proposed policies outside the health domain. The Committee strongly encourages the Department to study the benefits of incorporating assessments of health effects into the federal policymaking process with the intention to solve fundamental challenges of population health by better addressing the full range of factors that influence overall health and well- being ( e.g., education, safe environments, housing, transportation, economic development, access to healthy foods). Hospital Infrastructure. \u2014The Committee is concerned about the state of hospital infrastructure in the United States. The Com-mittee directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in con-sultation with State departments of health and other public health entities, to submit a report to the Committee within one year of the date of enactment of this Act. The report should assess barriers to accessing capital for infrastructure at hospitals serving vulnerable populations, including disproportionate share hospitals, sole com-munity hospitals, critical access hospitals, and public hospitals. The report should include an analysis of the impact of such bar-riers, including with respect to life-safety issues and emergency preparedness. Further, the report should include recommendations for addressing such barriers. Lyme Disease. \u2014The Committee encourages the Office of the Sec- retary to sponsor initiatives to spur innovation leading to the devel-opment of more effective diagnostics for all stages of Lyme disease and for the development of novel treatments that will return pa-tients to health and eradicate the disease, including innovation in tools and resources data, technology and scientist collaborations. The Committee is appreciative of the role of the Office of the Chief Technology Officer in promoting innovation to strengthen agency programs and foster public health solutions. The Committee urges the Secretary to coordinate and collaborate with the Operating Di-visions, including NIH, CDC, and FDA, to apply data, technology, and human resources to overcome obstacles and develop solutions to effectively manage and eradicate Lyme disease. The Committee VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, requests the Secretary submit within 180 days of enactment of this Act a multi-year plan outlining an initiative to conquer Lyme dis-ease. National Health Care Workforce Commission. \u2014The Committee includes $3,000,000 to establish the National Health Care Work-force Commission, as authorized by the Affordable Care Act. The Commission is intended to serve as a resource on health care work-force policy for Congress, the Administration, States, and localities and is tasked with evaluating healthcare workforce needs, assess-ing education and training activities, identifying barriers to im-proved coordination at the Federal, State, and local levels and rec-ommending changes to address those barriers. Nutritional Education. \u2014The Committee recognizes the value of proper nutrition and food's impact on health. Research shows mod-est weight loss, as little as five percent of total body weight, can help to improve Type 2 diabetes in patients who are overweight. The Committee encourages the Secretary to establish an inter-agency collaboration with the Department of Education and De-partment of Agriculture to enhance nutritional education in K-12 schools. The Committee urges the Secretary to be proactive in pro-moting wellness, healthy exercising habits and disease prevention by providing evidence-based nutritional services, information on ex-isting agency best practices, as well as a plan to expand nutritional education and means to increase access to nutritional foods for stu-dents. Patient Perspective on Ethics Advisory Boards. \u2014The Committee directs the Secretary to appoint no fewer than three patient advo-cates to any advisory board established under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 289a 1(b) with personal experience, either as a patient, or as a family mem-ber of a patient with eye disease, congenital birth conditions, diabe-tes, HIV/AIDS, Parkinson's disease, cancer, or other serious or life threatening conditions. The Secretary is further directed to ensure patient advocates are afforded the same responsibilities and weight of opinion as the other members of the ethics advisory board. Performance Measures. \u2014The Committee directs the Department to comply with title 31 of the United States Code, including the de-velopment of organizational priority goals and outcomes such as performance outcome measures, output measures, efficiency meas-ures, and customer service measures. The Committee further di-rects the Department to include an update on the progress of these efforts in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification. Persistent Poverty Counties. \u2014The Committee supports targeted investments in impoverished areas, particularly in persistent pov-erty counties and in other high-poverty census tracts. To under-stand how programs funded through the Department are serving these particular areas, the Committee directs the Department to submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations on the per-centage of funds allocated by all competitive grant programs and other anti-poverty programs in fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020 and estimates for fiscal year 2021 to serve individuals living in per-sistent poverty counties, as defined as a county that has had 20 percent or more of its population living in poverty over the past 30 years, as measured by the 1990 and 2000 decennial censuses and the most recent Small Area Income and Poverty estimates, or any territory or possession of the United States, and high-poverty VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul areas, as defined as any census tract with a poverty rate of at least 20 percent as measured by the 2014 2018 five-year data series available from the American Community Survey of the Census Bu-reau. The Department shall report this information to the Commit-tees within 90 days of such data being available and provide a briefing to the Committees not later than 180 days after enactment of this Act on how the Department is carrying out this directive. Prematurity and Maternal Mortality. \u2014The Committee notes that preterm birth and its complications continue to be the leading cause of death for infants in the U.S. and around the world. The Committee is aware that the PREEMIE Reauthorization Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-328) enables the Secretary to establish an inter-agency working group to improve coordination of programs and ac-tivities within the Department to prevent preterm birth, infant mortality, and related adverse birth outcomes. The Committee re-quests a report within 60 days of enactment of this Act regarding its activities to create the interagency workgroup and its activities to-date to accomplish the duties outlined in the PREEMIE Reau-thorization Act of 2018. In addition, the Committee recognizes the disparities in outcomes by race, ethnicity, geography, and income related to maternal mortality and prematurity and appreciates the work of many agencies in addressing these disparities. The Com-mittee urges the Interagency Workgroup, in collaboration with OMH, OWH, NICHD, NIMHD, CDC, CMS, IHS, HRSA, as well as the March of Dimes Prematurity Research Centers, to develop a co-ordinated Department-wide strategy and implementation plan to share learning and identify and address factors that lead to mater-nal mortality and prematurity, including those socio-economic and racial-ethnic factors contributing to disparities in outcomes and in-equities in health care. The Committee requests a report within 180 days of enactment of this Act on the aforementioned strategy and a plan for implementation. Repatriation. \u2014The Committee directs HHS to review the process for Congressional notification during repatriation flights of U.S. na-tionals from countries with developing health crises. The Com-mittee directs HHS to provide a report within 180 days of enact-ment of this Act outlining a revised plan to ensure that members of Congress are notified in a timely manner when a repatriation flight could be landing in their district. Shortages of Prescription Drugs. \u2014The Committee remains con- cerned about the shortage of prescription drugs, including generic drugs, in times of international crisis, disaster, or manufacturing shortages. Generic drugs account for 90 percent of prescriptions consumed in the U.S. The Committee directs the Secretary to con-duct a study on increased costs to consumers due to shortages of prescription drugs, including generic drugs. The study should out-line policy options to address cost disparity when there are short-ages in the generic version of life-saving drugs, as well as policy options to ensure sufficient supply of generic drugs. In addition, the study should evaluate how many Americans have faced shortages of their medications, including generic medications. The study should be submitted to the Committee within 180 days of enact-ment of this Act. Social Determinants Council. \u2014The Committee directs the Sec- retary of Health and Human Services to form an interagency-inter- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul Council, which shall be respon- sible for drafting and releasing a report on federal cross-agency op-portunities to address social determinants of health, including the potential benefits of grants to State, local, or Tribal jurisdictions to address social determinants of health. The Council shall consist of at least one designee from the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Education, the Indian Health Service, HUD, the Department of Labor, the Depart-ment of Transportation, three designees of the Department of Health and Human Services\u2014including CMS\u2014and others as deemed appropriate. Up to six council designees may be non-fed-eral subject matter experts with experience in areas such as imple-menting and evaluating transformative initiatives that harness data and conduct evaluations to increase the impact and cost-effec-tiveness of Federal Government Services and represent State, local, and Tribal health and human service agencies, public housing au-thorities, budget offices, State Medicaid agencies, or national Con-sumer organizations. The Council shall provide technical assistance to State, local, and tribal jurisdictions seeking to develop Social De-terminants Accelerator Plans through a new pilot program under the CDC. Staffing Reports. \u2014The Committee includes a general provision requiring the Department to submit a staffing report to the Com-mittee on a biannual basis. The Excel table will include: the names, titles, grades, agencies, and divisions of all of the political appointees, special government employees, and detailees that were employed by or assigned to the Department during the previous month. Sugar Substitutes. \u2014The Committee directs the Secretary to con- duct a study that reviews the sufficiency of the scientific evidence with regard to the safety of children consuming no- and low-calorie sugar substitutes in their diet, identifies gaps in the available evi-dence, and makes recommendations consistent with protecting the health of children. Teen Pregnancy Prevention Evidence Review. \u2014The Committee again includes $600,000 for the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation to maintain and continue to update the existing Teen Pregnancy Prevention Evidence Review. In addition, the Committee directs the agency to report to Congress within 30 days of enactment of this Act on steps it has taken to use the $600,000 appropriated for fiscal year 2020 for the Teen Pregnancy Preven-tion Evidence Review. Tribal Set-aside. \u2014The Committee notes that, according to the CDC, HIV-positive status among Native Americans is increasing and nearly one-in-five HIV-positive Native Americans is unaware of their status. In addition, only three-in-five receive care and less than half are virally suppressed. To increase access to HIV/AIDS, testing, prevention, and treatment, the Committee includes $3,000,000 as a Tribal set-aside within the Minority HIV/AIDS Pre-vention and Treatment program. Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health Access to Diapers. \u2014The Committee recognizes that many low-in- come families spend twice as much on diapers for their children compared to families who have the means to buy diapers in bulk VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, low price. The Committee is deeply concerned that one-in-three families in the U.S. struggles to afford diapers, which leads to high-er poverty and increased health risks for infants and toddlers. The Committee also notes that conditions such as diaper dermatitis and urinary tract infection can be caused by an insufficient supply of diapers and result in costly emergency room visits and doctor ap-pointments. The Committee requests HHS submit a report, within 180 days of enactment of this Act, estimating the number of emer-gency room visits and medical interventions caused by an insuffi-cient supply of diapers, the cost to our healthcare system of these preventable conditions, and the number of diapers that would be required to prevent many of the conditions from occurring. Clinical Psychological Training for Public Health Service Corps. \u2014The Committee supports the review by the Surgeon Gen- eral's office to update HHS regulations to permit the graduates of the 43 doctoral programs in clinical psychology accredited by the Psychological Clinical Science Accreditation System (PCSAS) to be employed by the Public Health Service Corps. This update is nec-essary as PCSAS was recognized in September 2012 by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) and now accredits 43 programs that are among the highest ranked clinical psychology program in the country. The Veterans Administration, the Associa-tion of Psychological Postdoctoral and Internship Centers, and oth-ers have already updated their regulations to permit the employ-ment of the graduates of PCSAS accredited programs. The Com-mittee urges the Surgeon General's office to finalize and implement these changes as soon as possible. Embryo Adoption Awareness Campaign. \u2014The Committee in- cludes $1,000,000 for the Embryo Adoption Awareness Campaign, the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level, to educate Ameri-cans about the existence of frozen human embryos (resulting from in-vitro fertilization), which may be available for donation/adoption to help other couples build their families. The Committee continues bill language permitting these funds also to be used to provide medical and administrative services to individuals adopting em-bryos, deemed necessary for such adoptions, consistent with the Code of Federal Regulations. Health Care for the Homeless. \u2014The Committee strongly encour- ages the Secretary to study the delivery of health care services to homeless persons. The department should then make recommenda-tions to Congress as to what should be done to improve the avail-ability and delivery of health care services for homeless persons. Insulin Affordability. \u2014The Committee directs HHS to study and submit a report to Congress on the relationship between insulin af-fordability and complications from diabetes. In the study, HHS should study the impact of insulin costs on health outcomes for in-dividuals with diabetes. The study should also quantify the cost to federal health programs of patients who are unable to afford their proper insulin doses. Obstetrics in Rural Areas. \u2014The Committee directs the Govern- ment Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a study on access to obstetrics (OB) in rural areas. According to the Rural Health Re-search Gateway, between 2004 and 2014, 179 rural counties lost hospital-based OB services. The GAO report should include policy VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, recommendations for ways to improve access to OB care in rural areas and prevent OB unit hospital closures in rural areas. Sexually Transmitted Infections. \u2014The Committee is aware of the recent statistics regarding the rise in sexually transmitted infec-tions (STI) and is pleased that the Assistant Secretary for Health is creating a National STI Action Plan to address increasing rates in these diseases. Further, the Committee requests that the Action Plan be responsive to findings included in the National Academy of Public Administration report on ''The Impact of Sexually Trans-mitted Diseases in the United States: Still Hidden, Getting Worse, Can be Controlled.'' The Committee requests an update within 180 days of enactment of this Act on progress being made to implement the plan. Teen Pregnancy Prevention. \u2014The Committee strongly supports the Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP) Program and the first two five-year cycles of grants. The TPP Program has been widely cited as a high-quality evidence-based program, including by the bipar-tisan Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking. Since 2017, however, there has been a well-established pattern of HHS admin-istering the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program in a manner that violates appropriations language and strays from commonly under-stood definitions of terms in appropriations language. The Com-mittee intends that TPP Program funds be used to carry out medi-cally accurate and age appropriate programs and has adopted defi-nitions of those terms and other requirements in bill language to carry out the original congressional intent. Similarly, The com-mittee has defined a requirement in bill language for Tier 2 pro-grams to rigorously test teen pregnancy prevention models. The committee directs HHS to submit a report within 60 days of enact-ment of this Act on how the agency is administering the TPP Pro-gram consistent with the statutory requirement ''to fund medically accurate and complete and age appropriate (as those terms are de-fined in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 713(e)) programs that reduce teen pregnancy and that do not withhold information about the effectiveness and benefits of correct and consistent use of condoms and other contra-ceptives and for the Federal costs associated with administering and evaluating such contracts and grants, of which not more than 10 percent of the available funds shall be for training and technical assistance, evaluation, outreach, and additional program support activities, and of the remaining amount 75 percent shall be for rep-licating programs that have been proven effective through rigorous evaluation to reduce teenage pregnancy, behavioral risk factors un-derlying teenage pregnancy, or other associated risk factors, and 25 percent shall be available for research and demonstration grants to develop, replicate, refine, and rigorously test (defined as random-ized controlled trial, quasi-experimental design, or regression dis-continuity design) additional models and innovative strategies for preventing teenage pregnancy'', and that meet the requirements listed in 42 U.S.C. 713(b)(2)(B)(ii) through (vi). Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program\u2014Evaluation .\u2014The Com- mittee notes that HHS awarded MITRE nearly $30,000,000 in fis-cal years 2017 and 2018, including approximately $28 million in funding appropriated to the TPP Program. The Committee is con-cerned this sole source award violates the appropriations language requiring TPP contracts and grants to be awarded competitively. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, The Committee includes bill language to prohibit the Department from making TPPP funding available to another agency through interagency agreement. The Committee directs HHS to report to Congress within 60 days of enactment of this Act on the amount of funds that have been obligated to MITRE Corporation in fiscal years 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020; the terms of the contract, grant, or other mechanism; from which of the congressionally-mandated categories (Tier 1, Tier 2, Program Support) the funds were trans-ferred; total expenditures by MITRE; the purposes of the expendi-tures and a justification for whether such purposes are consistent with the congressionally-mandated categories and uses; and any studies, reports, or work products that have been developed with such federal funds. Office of Minority Health The Committee includes $65,000,000 for the Office of Minority Health (OMH), which is $6,330,000 above the fiscal year 2020 en-acted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The OMH works with U.S. Public Health Service agencies and other agencies of the Department to address the health status and quality of life for racial and ethnic minority populations in the United States. OMH develops and implements new policies; partners with States, Tribes, and communities through cooperative agreements; supports research, demonstration, and evaluation projects; and disseminates information. Center for Indigenous Innovation and Health Equity .\u2014The Com- mittee recognizes the health and socioeconomic disparities facing indigenous communities in the United States and the resulting need to support the growing movement of indigenous innovation to draw on deeply-rooted values and practices address such chal-lenges. The Committee directs the Office of Minority Health to cre-ate a Center for Indigenous Innovation and Health Equity to sup-port efforts including research, education, service, and policy devel-opment related to advancing Indigenous solutions. To lead this Center, HHS should consider a partnership between two univer-sities, one with a focus on Indigenous health research and policy among Native Americans and Alaska Natives, and one with a focus on Indigenous health policy and innovation among Native Hawai-ians/Pacific Islanders. The Committee includes not less than $2,000,000 for grants to support this partnership. These academic institutions should have Indigenous leaders and engaged Indige-nous community partners in both innovation and health disparities focus areas, as well as aligned goals and priorities. The Center should disseminate best practices and lessons learned to other In-digenous communities, including through Indigenous digital story-telling. The Committee requests a written report within 120 days of enactment of this Act outlining the Department's plans for a Center for Indigenous Innovation and Health Equity. Health Disparities Education Program .\u2014The Committee strongly encourages the Office of Minority Health to establish and coordi-nate a health and health care disparities education program. The health and health care disparities education program should col-laborate with public, private, and nonprofit stakeholder organiza-tions on education, outreach, and public awareness campaigns tar-geting the general public and the medical community. In addition, VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, should disseminate scientific evidence for the exist- ence and extent of racial and ethnic disparities in health care; new research findings to health care providers and patients to assist them in understanding, reducing, and eliminating health and health care disparities; information about the impact of linguistic and cultural barriers on health care quality; and information about the importance and legality of data collection and analysis accord-ing to race, ethnicity, disability status, socioeconomic status, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, and primary language. Hispanic Serving Institutions .\u2014The Committee urges the Office of Minority Health to enter into cooperative agreements with His-panic Serving Institution medical schools in addition to existing agreements with Historically Black Colleges and Universities med-ical schools. The Committee urges OMH to develop a strategy to improve outreach efforts in soliciting these cooperative agreements, with particular focus on institutions within impoverished and un-derserved communities, and to report on such efforts within 90 days of enactment of this Act. Lupus Program .\u2014The Committee includes $2,000,000 to support the first year of a new multiyear grant cycle for the National Lupus Training, Outreach, and Clinical Trial Program (Lupus Pro-gram). The purpose of the Lupus Program is to reduce lupus-re-lated health disparities among racial and ethnic minority popu-lations disproportionately affected by lupus and also to increase mi-nority participation in lupus-related clinical trials. Minority Leadership Fellowship Program .\u2014The Committee in- cludes $1,000,000 for the Office of Minority Health to establish a Minority Leadership Fellowship grant program. The Committee is concerned there is a shortage of minority leaders in senior positions within HHS agencies. The purpose of the Minority Leadership Fel-lowship Program is to support a year-long fellowship program with-in HHS, including a curriculum of health care policy, leadership skill building, lectures, panels, case studies, cultural competence, and exchanges with national health care leaders who direct Federal health policy and programs that impact the health and wellness of minority populations. Racial and Ethnic Health Inequities .\u2014The Committee includes $1,500,000 for the Office of Minority Health to enter into an agree-ment with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to provide an evidence-based, non-partisan analysis of Federal policies that contribute to racial and ethnic health inequi-ties, as well as potential solutions. The study should review current Federal policies that contribute to health inequities, including those policies that impact the social determinants of health. Based on that review, the analysis should identify the most effective or promising strategies to eliminate or modify to advance racial and ethnic health equity. The analysis should be inclusive of all racial and ethnic minority populations in the United States, including Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Is-lander. Social Determinants of Health .\u2014The Committee is aware that so- cial determinants of health are critical drivers of health outcomes and health care costs. Social determinants of health can have im-pacts on the health outcomes of specific populations and impact VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, disparities in the United States. OMH is encouraged to enter into cooperative agreements with academic institutions with HBCU, HSI, or Minority-Serving Institution status that have ex-pertise in addressing social determinants of health to address the impact of social determinants on minority populations. Underserved Populations Along the U.S.-Mexico Border .\u2014The Committee urges the HHS Office of Minority Health to examine how it can support health professions schools at Hispanic Serving Institutions along the United States-Mexico border, including ways to engage community partnerships that utilize cancer prevention tools including screening, education, and diagnostics to meet the healthcare needs of underserved populations along the border. The Committee further encourages OMH to work with the CMS Office of Minority Health to support these types of cancer prevention ac-tivities. Office on Women's Health The Committee includes $36,640,000 for the Office on Women's Health, which is $3,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Combatting Violence Against Women .\u2014The Committee includes $7,100,000 to combat violence against women through the State partnership initiative and to have the Office on Women's Health (OWH) work in conjunction with the Family Violence Prevention and Services Program office. This is an increase of $3,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. This program provides funding to State-level public and private health programs to part-ner with domestic and sexual violence organizations to improve healthcare providers' ability to help victims of violence and improve prevention programs. In addition, the Committee recommends OWH create a state-level pilot program to incentivize substance use disorder treatment providers to be trained on intimate partner violence. The pilot program would also include partnerships with domestic and sexual violence organizations at the state and local level to address the intersections of intimate partner violence and substance use. Menstrual Hygiene Products .\u2014The Committee is concerned with the affordability and accessibility of menstrual hygiene products and information regarding these products, which are basic health care necessities. Per the report requested in House Report 116-62, the Committee encourages the Office on Women's Health to include in the report the number of individuals who experience problems with affordability and accessibility of menstrual hygiene products by race, socioeconomic status, and age. The Committee encourages OWH to include in the study an assessment of the availability and accessibility of menstrual hygiene products within institutions, in-cluding public schools, colleges, and universities, and provide a price comparison on fair market costs of menstrual products. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, OFFICE OF THE NATIONAL COORDINATOR FOR HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $60,367,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 50,717,000 Committee Recommendation ............................................................. 60,367,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... - - - Change from budget request ...................................................... +9,650,000 The Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) is the principal Federal entity charged with coordinating efforts to implement and use health information technology and exchange electronically health information. Assessment of the State of Health Information Technology at Hos- pitals .\u2014The Committee is concerned about the state of health in- formation technology at hospitals in the United States. The Com-mittee directs the ONC, in consultation with State departments of health and other public health entities, to submit a report to the Committee within one year of the date of enactment of this Act. The report should assess the state of electronic medical records at U.S. hospitals and the dependence of hospitals and health systems on technology that is outdated or debunked, as well as barriers as-sociated with updating health information technology, including with respect to hardware, software, administrative burden, staff training, and associated costs. Health Information Technology Surveillance .\u2014The Committee understands that ONC is actively coordinating with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on data collection and sur-veillance activities during the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, but that much of the data being shared today are being transmitted via paper or PDF files. To better understand agency surveillance ca-pacity and future needs, the Committee requests a report within 120 days of enactment of this Act on coordination activities to date, the extent to which computable information is being shared with local, State, and Federal authorities, identified barriers to inter-operable exchange of electronic surveillance data, and strategies that can be put in place to improve the surveillance technology in-frastructure. Interagency Task Force on Health and Human Services Informa- tion Technology (IT) .\u2014The Committee recognizes a growing need for the integration and modernization of Federal IT systems and notes that increased investment in IT would greatly improve em-ployee and recipient interactions with Federal health and human service programs while enhancing program efficiency, integrity, analytic capability, and network security. The Committee urges the Chief Information Office and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of HHS, in collaboration with the White House CTO and U.S. Depart-ment of Agriculture (USDA), as well as the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) within HHS, 18F within the General Services Administration (GSA), and the Cy-bersecurity and Infrastructure security Agency (CISA) within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, to establish an interagency task force that will examine existing IT infrastructure in federal health human service programs nationwide and identify the bar-riers to successfully integrating and modernizing health and human services IT, and the network security necessary for health VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, human services IT interoperability. The task force shall submit to the Committee within 180 days of enactment on this Act a re-port on its progress and on recommendations for further Congres-sional action, which should include estimated costs for agencies to make progress on interoperability initiatives. Interoperability .\u2014The Committee notes that finalization of the rule to implement the interoperability provisions of the 21st Cen-tury Cures Act takes significant steps forward to give patients greater access to their health data and to improve the electronic flow of health information across care settings. The Committee ex-pects ONC to keep the Committee informed of any delays in imple-mentation. Patient Data Matching .\u2014The Committee is concerned that there is no consistent and accurate way to link patients to their health information across the care continuum and notes the serious pa-tient safety concerns that arise when data is mismatched or when important data is missing. Although the Committee continues to prohibit the use of funds to promulgate or adopt any final standard providing for the assignment of a unique health identifier for an in-dividual until such activity is authorized, the Committee notes that this limitation does not prohibit HHS from examining the issues around patient matching. The Committee continues to encourage the Secretary to provide technical assistance to private-sector-led initiatives to develop a coordinated national strategy that will pro-mote patient safety by accurately identifying patients to their health information. OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $80,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 90,000,000 Committee Recommendation ............................................................. 80,000,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... - - - Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a5$10,000,000 The Committee provides $80,000,000 for the Office of Inspector General (OIG), which is equal to the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $10,000,000 less than the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The bill includes language making a portion of funding available for two years, as requested in the Congressional Budget Justification, for the investigation and enforcement of information blocking. In addition, within the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control (HCFAC) program discretionary appropriations for fiscal year 2021, the Committee provides the OIG with $98,000,000. Mandatory ap-propriations for this office also are contained in the HCFAC pro-gram and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. The Committee notes that additional funding was provided to the OIG for the purposes of investigations related to the Unaccom-panied Children program in the Emergency Supplemental Appro-priations for Humanitarian Assistance and Security at the South-ern Border Act, 2019 (P.L. 116-26) In addition, the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-123) included $2,000,000; the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) in-cluded $4,000,000; and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (P.L. 116-138) included $6,000,000 VerDate Sep 11 2014 the OIG to conduct oversight and investigations of activities funded by emergency supplemental appropriations for COVID-19. OFFICE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $38,798,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 30,286,000 Committee Recommendation ............................................................. 38,798,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... - - - Change from budget request ...................................................... +8,512,000 The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is responsible for enforcing civil rights statutes that prohibit discrimination in health and human services programs. OCR implements the civil rights laws through a compliance program designed to generate voluntary compliance among all HHS recipients. Assisted Suicide Laws and Disabled Americans .\u2014The Committee is aware of a recent National Council on Disability report entitled ''The Danger of Assisted Suicide Laws,'' which raises concern that such laws could lead to a two-tiered system that results dispropor-tionately in the deaths of people with disabilities. Accordingly, the Committee strongly encourages OCR to clarify that all HHS suicide prevention grants and services must comply with existing disability rights laws, including the ADA, Sections 504 and 508 of the Reha-bilitation Act, and Section 1557, including the provisions requiring accessible communications, so that all videos, documents, and other products ensure access to persons with disabilities. The Committee further strongly encourages OCR to clarify that Sections 504 and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act require physicians to provide people with disabilities with information on the full array of available clin-ical treatments and available long-term services and supports (LTSS) and to require that referrals to such treatments and serv-ices be given if requested. Finally, the Committee encourages OCR to recommend that hospitals create a disability ombudsperson posi-tion who is authorized to facilitate communication between healthcare providers and patients with disabilities or their proxies and advocate on the patient s behalf, when required, to ensure that all clinical and LTSS options and choices are made available. RETIREMENT PAY AND MEDICAL BENEFITS FOR COMMISSIONED OFFICERS Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $623,591,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 653,023,000 ............................................................. 653,023,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +29,432,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - The Committee provides for retirement pay and medical benefits of Public Health Service Commissioned Officers, for payments under the Retired Serviceman's Family Protection Plan, and for medical care of dependents and retired personnel. PUBLIC HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES EMERGENCY FUND Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $2,737,458,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 2,641,465,000 ............................................................. 2,827,558,000 Change from +90,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +185,993,000 VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 This account supports the activities of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) and other components within the Office of the Secretary to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the health consequences of bioterrorism and other public health emergencies, including pandemic influenza. It also includes funding for the Department's cybersecurity efforts. In addition, the Committee provides $4,500,000,000 in emergency appropriations for BARDA to address the COVID-19 pandemic, in-cluding emergency appropriations for advanced research and devel-opment and advanced manufacturing of vaccines and therapeutics; enhancements to domestic vaccine facilities; and innovation in anti-bacterial research and development. The emergency appropriation is further described under Title VI of this committee report. Further, the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supple- mental Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-123) included $3,000,000,000; the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $26,725,500,000; and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (P.L. 116-139) included $1,000,000,000 through the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund for advanced research and de-velopment of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics; healthcare system preparedness; medical surge capacity, and procurement and distribution of personal protective equipment, ventilators, and other medical supplies, to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response The Committee provides $2,451,128,000 for activities adminis- tered by ASPR. ASPR is responsible for coordinating national poli-cies and plans for medical and public health preparedness and for administering a variety of public health preparedness programs. Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise Multi-Year Budget .\u2014The Committee encourages ASPR to delineate information on emerging infectious diseases, pandemic influenza, and antimicrobial resistance investments in its annual five-year budget plan for medical countermeasure (MCM) development to clarify how ASPR is considering such naturally occurring threats in relation to other priority areas of MCM development, particularly given their inclusion in the Strategic Initiatives section of the Pan-demic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act (P.L. 116-22). Repatriation Flights .\u2014The Committee directs HHS to review the process for Congressional notification during repatriation flights from countries with developing health crises. Within 200 days after enactment, the Committee directs HHS to provide the Committee with a report detailing a new strategy to ensure that members of Congress are notified in a timely manner when a repatriation flight is headed, or potentially headed, to their district. Operations The Committee includes $30,938,000 for Operations. This ac- count supports activities within the Assistant Secretary's Imme-diate Office; the Office of the Chief Operating Officer; the Office of Acquisitions Management, Contracts, and Grants; and the Office of Financial Planning and Analysis. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, and Emergency Operations The Committee includes $24,654,000 for Preparedness and Emer- gency Operations. The Preparedness and Emergency Operations account funds the Office of Emergency Management, which support a full spectrum of emergency management responsibilities, includ-ing planning, coordination, logistics, training, and responding to planned events and unplanned incidents. National Disaster Medical System The Committee includes $67,404,000, an increase of $10,000,000, for the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS). NDMS deploys trained medical teams to communities impacted by public health and medical emergencies due to natural and man-made incidents. Biocontainment Surge Capacity .\u2014The Committee encourages ef- forts to create biocontainment surge capacity. Pediatric Disaster Care .\u2014The Committee includes $10,000,000 for pediatric disaster care, as pediatric care requires specialized training, equipment, supplies, and pharmaceuticals that may not be readily available in an emergency. When disaster strikes, mini-mizing the impacts of children's exposure to infectious diseases, trauma, and other hazards is a challenge for healthcare facilities and stresses the ability of the healthcare system to respond. The Committee recognizes that Pediatric Disaster Centers of Excellence are working to address appropriate planning and response capabili-ties that support the specific needs of children during public health emergencies and disasters, such as mass casualty events. Hospital Preparedness Program The Committee includes $300,555,000, an increase of $25,000,000, for the Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP). HPP supports cooperative agreements with State, local, and territorial health departments to build healthcare coalitions that improve re-gional and local hospital preparedness and surge capacity in public health emergencies. High Consequence, Emerging, Infectious Disease Threats .\u2014The Committee supports the continuation of the nation's preparedness against high consequence, emerging, infectious disease threats. The Committee directs no less than $11,000,000 for the National Emerging Special Pathogen Training and Education Center (NETEC) and the ten existing regional Ebola and other special pathogen treatment centers. Hospital Preparedness Grants .\u2014The Committee includes funding for critical support to State, local and regional partners to advance health care system preparedness and response. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority The Committee includes $561,700,000 for the Biomedical Ad- vanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). In addi-tion, the Committee provided significant, multi-year resources to BARDA in the COVID-19 supplemental funding bills. BARDA's role in supporting the development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines is critical to our nation's response. BARDA supports the advanced development of vaccines, drugs, and therapeutics for potential serious public health threats, including chemical, biologi- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul cal, radiological, and nuclear threats, pandemic influenza, and emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. In addition, the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supple- mental Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-123) included $2,000,000,000; the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $3,500,000,000; and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (P.L. 116-139) included $1,000,000,000 for advanced research and development of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics, as well as enhancements to domestic vaccine facilities. Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients .\u2014The Committee is concerned with the national security risk of our increased reliance on foreign- based sources of active pharmaceutical ingredients, their chemical components, and off-shore drug production. The Committee recog-nizes the importance of domestic drug manufacturing and onshore production of medicine, and provided supplemental emergency funding in the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) to support increased U.S.-based manufacturing capabilities. The successful work of BARDA in addressing public health vulnerabilities and securing a national stockpile of drugs has unique potential to consider pro-gram expansion to include active at-risk drug ingredients. The Committee strongly urges BARDA to engage in public-private part-nerships for U.S.-based advanced manufacturing for active pharma-ceutical ingredients and their chemical precursors for the Strategic National Stockpile. Antifungal Resistance .\u2014The Committee understands the CARB- X program supports development of products targeted to address pathogens on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2013 Antibiotic Resistant Threats. The Committee is aware CDC released an updated Antimicrobial Threat Report in 2019, which includes several fungal pathogens. Accordingly, the Com-mittee urges the Secretary to update the scope of support for the CARB-X program to include pathogens listed in the 2019 CDC An-tibiotic Resistant Threats, including products that target fungal pathogens. Antimicrobial Resistance .\u2014The Committee recognizes anti- microbial resistance is an increasingly serious threat to America's public health and national security. The antibiotic commercial mar-ket, especially in the national security space, presents challenges as novel products currently may have limited commercial markets. ASPR has made great progress over the past fifteen plus years in combatting antibiotic resistance through supporting the develop-ment and availability of novel antibiotics but market viability issues have limited commercial success. The Committee strongly encourages ASPR to review its current program to ensure its focus is on projects that enhance the U.S. national security posture against antibiotic-resistant threats through novel, broad-spectrum antibiotics for use against biothreats or serious, secondary infec-tions that would result from other chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear threats or pandemic influenza especially if a commercial market does not exist. ASPR is encouraged to explore alternative support methods to incubate, test, and refine projects aligned to-ward such national security priorities. Furthermore, ASPR is en-couraged to explore and enhance the use of authorized emergency use, government licensing provisions, and other mechanisms to pro- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, its investments aligned to national security priorities that do not have viable commercial markets. Disease X Medical Countermeasures .\u2014The novel coronavirus pandemic of 2019 demonstrated that the U.S. urgently needs the ability to more rapidly respond to newly emerging or unknown pathogens with the potential to cause an epidemic in the U.S. The Committee urges HHS to work with the Department of Defense to implement a dedicated medical countermeasures program focused on developing medical countermeasures in months, not years, for previously unknown epidemic pathogens in order to enhance our ability to save lives immediately with classes of medical counter-measures that are broadly applicable. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justification. Ebola .\u2014The Committee remains concerned by all global health threats, including the ongoing threat of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its potential to spread. The Committee requests a briefing from ASPR within 60 days of enactment of this Act regarding the five-year spend plan for Ebola therapeutics, diagnostics and vaccines to counter this material threat. Novel, Non-Vaccine Approaches to Respiratory Viruses .\u2014The Committee urges the Secretary to provide adequate funding to sup-port the manufacturing of novel bio-specific immunotherapies that show potential for the universal prevention and treatment of influ-enza. Strengthening Domestic Medical Manufacturing .\u2014The Com- mittee is concerned about the nation's lack of medical infrastruc-ture to produce essential products such as medical devices, medical equipment, generic pharmaceuticals, and personal protective equip-ment. The coronavirus pandemic demonstrated the weaknesses in the U.S. supply chain and the dependence of the U.S. healthcare system on other countries. The U.S. must invest in our domestic capacity. The Committee directs the Secretary to conduct a study on methods to increase our domestic medical manufacturing capac-ity and reduce dependence on foreign suppliers. The study should include potential incentives and investments necessary for compa-nies to increase domestic production of components vital to the U.S. healthcare system, and the consideration of maintaining an online library of pre-approved design information and usage guidance to speed enlistment of non-traditional suppliers. The study shall be reported to the Committee no later than 180 days after enactment of this Act. Tuberculosis .\u2014Drug resistant TB is identified as a serious threat level pathogen to the United States by the National Strategy for CARB. The Committee remains interested in BARDA's investment in new TB diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines all of which are ur-gently needed to address growing drug resistance. The Committee requests a report on BARDA's investments in drug resistant TB re-search in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justification. Vaccine Production .\u2014The Committee urges BARDA to support vaccines produced through recombinant DNA technology in addi-tion to traditionally-produced vaccines to facilitate the competitive process for all vaccine manufacturers. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, Planning The Committee includes $19,877,000, an increase of $5,000,000, for Policy and Planning. The Office of Policy and Planning leads HHS' emergency preparedness and response strategic direction and policy coordination. National Biodefense Strategy .\u2014The Committee includes $5,000,000 to support the implementation of the National Bio-defense Strategy. Project BioShield Special Reserve Fund The Committee includes $735,000,000 for Project BioShield. These funds support the acquisition of promising medical counter-measures developed through BARDA contracts for the most serious public health threats. Strategic National Stockpile The Committee includes $705,000,000 for the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS). In addition, the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Act (P.L. 116-123) included $500,000,000 and the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included up to $16,000,000,000 for the Strategic National Stockpile. In response to COVID-19, the SNS was utilized in an unprece- dented manner in response to the nation-wide need for supplies, in-cluding personal protective equipment and ventilators. While there will be many lessons learned from the COVID-19 response, it is blatantly clear that the SNS was not prepared for a pandemic re-sponse and our nation has very limited domestic production of the products in the SNS. The Committee continues to expect that CDC will have a significant role in providing scientific expertise in deci-sion-making related to the procurement of countermeasures, as well as maintaining strong relationships with State and local pub-lic health departments to facilitate efficient deployment of counter-measures in public health emergencies. Budget Submission .\u2014The Committee directs that a professional judgement budget be submitted at the same time as the fiscal year 2022 President's Budget with respect to expenditures necessary to maintain the minimum level of relevant supplies in the Strategic National Stockpile, including in case of a significant pandemic, in consultation with the working group under section 319F(a) of the Public Health Service Act and the Public Health Emergency Med-ical Countermeasures Enterprise established under section 2811-1 of such Act. Forward Deployment .\u2014The Committee strongly urges HHS to use discretion in allowing the forward deployment of SNS medica-tion in reasonable quantities in or near high-threat, high-density urban jurisdictions that have demonstrated an ability to stand up Points of Dispensing faster than SNS medications can be delivered to jurisdictions. Inventory of Ventilators and Personal Protective Equipment .\u2014The Committee directs the Secretary to submit a weekly report on the current inventory of ventilators and personal protective equipment in the Strategic National Stockpile, including the numbers of face shields, gloves, goggles and glasses, gowns, head covers, masks, and respirators, as well as deployment of ventilators and personal VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul protective equipment during the previous week, reported by State and other jurisdiction. The Secretary is directed to continue to sub-mit weekly reports until the public health emergency related to COVID-19 is no longer in effect. Revolving Management .\u2014The Committee recognizes that the COVID-19 Pandemic was an unprecedented challenge for the SNS. Prior to the pandemic, the SNS management system was based on large, infrequent purchases. The Committee encourages consider-ation of a revolving method, such as utilized by the Defense Logis-tics Agency. Vulnerable Populations .\u2014The Committee is concerned about the availability of medical countermeasures for individuals who are immunocompromised with common conditions like eczema, HIV, and diabetes. Some traditional vaccines contain a live virus that can be harmful or even fatal for patients with these conditions. Therefore, the Committee encourages HHS to evaluate its stockpile of medical countermeasures to ensure appropriate supplies are available to protect these vulnerable populations. Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration\u2014Cybersecurity The Committee provides $57,820,000 for information technology cybersecurity in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Adminis-tration. These funds provide for continuous monitoring and security incident response coordination for the Department's computer sys-tems and networks. Office of National Security The Committee provides $8,510,000 for the Office of National Se- curity to maintain the security of the Department's personnel, sys-tems, and critical infrastructure. Office of Public Health and Science\u2014Medical Reserve Corps The Committee includes $6,000,000 for the Medical Reserve Corps program, which is a network of local volunteers made up of doctors, dentists, nurses, pharmacists, and other community mem-bers who work to strengthen the public health infrastructure and preparedness capabilities of their communities. Pandemic Influenza Preparedness The Committee includes $310,000,000, an increase of $50,000,000, for the pandemic influenza preparedness program. This funding supports research and development of vaccines and the next-generation influenza medical countermeasures, prepared-ness testing and evaluation, and stockpiling. Pandemic Response .\u2014The Committee remains concerned about our nation's limited ability to satisfy the Federal government's goal of delivering vaccines within 12 weeks of a declared pandemic with multiple vaccine suppliers. The Secretary shall provide a report no later than 180 days after enactment of this Act on current flexible manufacturing platforms and domestic multi-modal facilities with the potential to rapidly respond to emerging infectious diseases and pandemics to include influenza. Furthermore, within the funds pro-vided for Pandemic Influenza Preparedness, the Committee strong-ly encourages the Department to facilitate access to approved adju-vants with priority given to late-stage and pre-clinical technologies VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 have achieved regulatory approval or are in advanced-state clinical development.

TITLE III\u2014DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IMPROVING ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ................................... - - - Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ................................. $19,363,430,000 Committee Recommendation ....................................... - - - Change from enacted level ................................... - - - Change from budget request ................................ \u00a519,363,430,000 VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Committee rejects the fiscal year 2021 budget request for a new Elementary and Secondary Education Block Grant. EDUCATION FOR THE DISADVANTAGED Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ................................... $16,996,790,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ................................. - - - Committee Recommendation ....................................... 17,258,290,000 Change from enacted level ................................... +261,500,000 Change from budget request ................................ +17,258,290,000 This account provides foundational funding to help ensure all children receive a fair, equitable and high-quality education. Of the total amount available, $6,336,990,000 is appropriated for fiscal year 2021 for obligation on or after July 1, 2022 and $10,841,177,000 is appropriated for fiscal year 2021 for obligation on or after October 1, 2022. Grants to Local Educational Agencies For fiscal year 2021, the Committee recommends $16,563,802,000 for Title I grants to LEAs, an increase of $254,000,000 over the fis-cal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request proposed to eliminate this program. Title I is the cornerstone of federal K-12 education programs and critical to the nation's collec-tive efforts to ensure that every child has the opportunity to obtain a high-quality education. The program serves an estimated 25 mil-lion students in nearly 90 percent of school districts and nearly 60 percent of all public schools. Providing additional resources so that children can succeed in school and in life is one of the Committee's highest priorities in the bill. Of the amounts provided for Title I programs, $6,459,401,000 is available for Basic Grants to Local Educational Agencies (LEAs or school districts), which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. Basic grants are awarded to school districts with at least 10 low-income children who make up more than two percent of the school-age population. Within the amount for Title I Basic Grants, up to $5,000,000 is made available to the Secretary of Education (Secretary) on Octo-ber 1, 2020, to obtain annually-updated LEA-level poverty data from the Bureau of the Census. The Committee recommends $1,362,301,000 for Title I Con- centration Grants, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 en-acted level. Concentration Grants target funds to school districts in which the number of low-income children exceeds 6,500 or 15 per-cent of the total school-age population. The Committee recommends $4,371,050,000 for Title I Targeted Grants, which is $127,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. Targeted Grants provide higher payments to school districts with high numbers or percentages of low-income students. The Committee recommends $4,371,050,000 for Title I Education Finance Incentive Grants (EFIGs), which is $127,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. EFIGs provide payments to States and school districts that incorporate equity and effort factors to im-prove the equity of State funding systems. The Committee urges that the Department support LEAs' devel- opment of plans under section 1112(b)(6) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) that describe the amount of funds VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, students reserved under section 1113(c)(3)(A) of the ESEA, how such amount was determined, and the amount of the prior year's reservation that was spent on homeless students. The Committee further urges that the Department support SEAs' devel-opment of plans under section 1111(g)(1)(F) of the ESEA that de-scribe how the SEA will monitor the amount and use of funds re-served for homeless students under section 1113(c)(3)(A) and pro-vide technical assistance to assist LEAs in effectively using such funds to support homeless students. The Committee believes that all students should be able to access texts that reflect their interests and diverse cultures. Unfortu-nately, too many Black, Latino, Asian-American, and Native stu-dents are unable to access such books and printed materials in their classrooms and school libraries. To address this challenge, the Committee supports classroom and school libraries that seek to in-clude content that reflects the history and diversity of their student populations. The Committee supports efforts by State and school district lead- ers to improve student learning environments by prioritizing rig-orous culturally and linguistically responsive education (CLRE). Such efforts not only prioritize an emphasis on the experiences of culturally and linguistically diverse student populations in aca-demic curricula, but also help students confront racism and preju-dice in common discussions of literature and history. The Com-mittee notes that rigorous CLRE and anti-racist education can sup-port critical thinking skills, feelings of student belonging, and stu-dent social and emotional well-being. The Committee is concerned with and opposes proposals from the Administration that divert public education funding to private school voucher programs and that block-grants ESEA funds while eliminating vital resources such as Title I grants to LEAs. The Committee notes that the ESEA recognizes military-con- nected students as a distinct subgroup of students. More than 80 percent of military-connectedchildren attend public schools. Stu-dents with parents/guardians who serve full-time in the military move and change schools frequently. In addition, they may experi-ence trauma resulting from separations from a parent/guardian due to their parents' service to the U.S. Military. The Military Stu-dent Identifier provides educators, school leaders, and policymakers with critical information to personalize attention and direct re-sources to better support military dependent children. Current law directs the Military Student Identifier toward the children of active duty families, leaving out the nearly one-half million children of the reserve component, both National Guard and Reserves. The Committee supports efforts to address the unique needs of children whose parents/guardians serve in the National Guard and reserve components. The Committee encourages the Department to provide technical assistance and support to State and local educational agencies in implementing evidence-based strategies for improving schools iden-tified for comprehensive and targeted support and improvement under Title I. In particular, the Committee notes the importance of principals and other school leaders in bringing about improvements in student achievement and other outcomes. Research shows there are virtually no documented instances of low-performing schools VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul being turned around without intervention by a powerful leader. Demonstrated effects of successful leadership are considerably greater in schools that are in more difficult circumstances. Addi-tionally, research has found that school leadership is second only to classroom instruction as an influence on student learning, and 97 percent of teachers say that the principal is responsible for de-termining if a school can attract and retain great teachers. There-fore, the Committee encourages the Department to provide tech-nical assistance to States and school districts on strengthening school leadership as a mechanism for improving results in low-per-forming schools, particularly those identified for comprehensive and targeted support and improvement within the State's account-ability system. The Committee directs the Department to respond to this request in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Jus-tification. The CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $30,750,000,000 for the Education Stabilization Fund (ESF) to prevent, prepare for, and re-spond to the coronavirus, including $153,750,000 for the Outlying Areas and $153,750,000 for the Bureau of Indian Education. The ESF included $13,500,000,000 in funding for elementary and sec-ondary emergency relief and $3,000,000,000 in funding to gov-ernors for elementary, secondary, and postsecondary emergency re-lief. Comprehensive Literacy Development Grants The Committee recommends $192,000,000 for Comprehensive Literacy Development Grants, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request proposes to eliminate this program. Funds are awarded to States to subgrant to school districts and/or early education programs to improve lit-eracy instruction for disadvantaged students. Innovative Approaches to Literacy The Committee recommends $28,500,000 for Innovative Ap- proaches to Literacy, which is $1,500,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 request proposes to eliminate this program. Funds support competitive grants to school libraries and national not-for-profit organizations to provide books and lit-eracy activities to children and families in high-need communities. The Committee directs the Department to prioritize in the fiscal year 2021 competition underserved communities in urban school districts in which students from low-income families make up at least 50 percent of enrollment. State Agency Programs: Migrant The Committee recommends $378,501,000 for the State Agency Program for Migrant Education, which is $3,750,000 above the fis-cal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 request proposes to eliminate this program. This program supports special edu-cational and related services for children of migrant agricultural workers and fishermen, including: (1) supplementary academic education; (2) remedial or compensatory instruction; (3) English for limited English proficient students; (4) testing; (5) guidance coun-seling; and (6) other activities to promote coordination of services VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, across States for migrant children whose education is interrupted by frequent moves. State Agency Programs: Neglected and Delinquent For the State Agency Program for Neglected and Delinquent Children, the Committee recommends $48,864,000, which is $1,250,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 request proposes to eliminate this program. This formula grant program supports educational services for children and youth under age 21 in State-run institutions, attending community day programs, and in correctional facilities. A portion of these funds is provided for projects that support the successful re-entry of youth from the criminal justice system into postsecondary and vocational programs. Special Programs for Migrant Students The Committee recommends $46,623,000 for the Special Pro- grams for Migrant Students, which is $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 request proposes to eliminate this program. These programs make grants to colleges, universities, and nonprofit organizations to support educational programs designed for students who are engaged in migrant and other seasonal farm work. The High School Equivalency Program (HEP) recruits migrant students age 16 and over and provides aca-demic and support services to help those students obtain a high school equivalency certificate and subsequently to gain employment or admission to a postsecondary institution or training program. The College Assistance Migrant Program (CAMP) provides tutoring and counseling services to first-year, undergraduate migrant stu-dents and assists those students in obtaining student financial aid for their remaining undergraduate years. IMPACT AID Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $1,486,112,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 1,410,799,000 ............................................................. 1,491,112,000 Change from ......................................................... +5,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +80,313,000 This account supports payments to school districts affected by Federal activities, such as those that educate children whose fami-lies are connected with the military or who live on Indian land. Basic Support Payments The Committee recommends $1,345,242,000 for Basic Support Payments to LEAs, which is $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Basic Sup-port Payments compensate school districts for lost tax revenue and are made on behalf of Federally-connected children, such as chil-dren of members of the uniformed services who live on Federal property. The reporting method used to calculate the amount of Impact Aid a school receives is critical to ensuring accurate data for eligible communities. Correct student counts ensure adequate resources are provided for students. The Committee requests the Department as-sess any potential challenges with under reporting of eligible stu- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, develop recommendations for addressing such chal- lenges. The result of such assessment is requested in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification. Payments for Children with Disabilities The Committee recommends $48,316,000 for Payments for Chil- dren with Disabilities, which is the same as both the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. These payments compensate school districts for the increased costs of serving Federally-connected children with disabilities. Facilities Maintenance The Committee recommends $4,835,000 for Facilities Mainte- nance, which is the same as both the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. These capital payments are authorized for maintenance of certain facilities owned by the Department. Construction The Committee recommends $17,406,000 for the Construction program, which is the same as both the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Funding is allocated by formula to eligible LEAs for school construction activities under section 7007(b) of ESEA. Payments for Federal Property The Committee recommends $75,313,000 for Payments for Fed- eral Property, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request proposes to eliminate this program. Funds are awarded to school districts to compensate for lost tax revenue as the result of Federal acquisition of real property since 1938. SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $5,404,967,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 392,374,000 ............................................................. 5,453,617,000 Change from ......................................................... +48,650,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +5,061,243,000 The Committee recommendation includes $5,453,617,000 for the School Improvement Programs account. Supporting Effective Instruction State Grants The Committee recommends $2,154,330,000 for Supporting Effec- tive Instruction State Grants (Title II-A), which is $22,500,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budg-et request proposes to eliminate the program. Title II-A grants pro-vide States and school districts with a flexible source of funding to strengthen the skills and knowledge of teachers, principals, and ad-ministrators to enable them to improve student achievement. The Committee is supportive of efforts to strengthen school lead- ership through the Title II-A program. Research has consistently demonstrated that school leadership is second only to classroom in-struction as an influence on student learning, and 97 percent of teachers say that the principal is responsible for determining if a VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, school can attract and retain great teachers. The Committee par- ticularly takes note of the fact that, under ESEA, States may re-serve approximately three percent of their Title II-A formula allo-cations to carry out activities for principals and other school lead-ers and encourages States to make use of this optional reservation so as to maximize the impact of the Title II-A program. The Com-mittee directs the Department to encourage, through guidance or technical assistance, SEAs to utilize the school leader three percent Title II-A set-aside to better drive school improvement efforts. Supplemental Education Grants The Committee recommends $16,699,000 for Supplemental Edu- cation Grants to the Federated States of Micronesia and the Re-public of the Marshall Islands, which is the same as both the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The Compact of Free Association Amendments Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-188) authorizes these entities to receive funding for general education assistance. Nita M. Lowey 21st Century Community Learning Centers The Committee recommends $1,262,673,000 for Nita M. Lowey 21st Century Community Learning Centers, $13,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget re-quest proposes to eliminate this program. Funds are awarded by formula to States, which in turn distribute funds on a competitive basis to local school districts, nonprofit organizations, and other public entities. The Committee notes that only one in three 21st Century Com- munity Learning Centers grant applications is awarded, reflecting substantial unmet demand for these opportunities. The $13,000,000 increase over fiscal year 2020 will help communities providing afterschool programs serve 15,600 more students than in fiscal year 2020. State Assessments The Committee recommends $378,000,000 for State Assessments, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $8,900,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Funds are available to develop and implement academic standards and as-sessments. The program includes a set-aside for audits to identify and eliminate low-quality or duplicative assessments. Education for Homeless Children and Youth The Committee recommends $102,650,000 for the Education for Homeless Children and Youth program, which is $1,150,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The 2021 budget request proposes to eliminate this program. Grants are allocated to States in proportion to the total each State receives under the Title I pro-gram. Training and Advisory Services The Committee recommends $6,575,000 for Training and Advi- sory Services authorized by Title IV-A of the Civil Rights Act, which is the same as both the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Title IV-A authorizes technical VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul training services for school districts to address prob- lems associated with desegregation on the basis of race, sex, or na-tional origin. The Department awards three-year grants to regional Equity Assistance Centers (EACs) located in each of the 10 Depart-ment of Education regions. The EACs provide services to school districts upon request. Typical activities include disseminating in-formation on successful education practices and legal requirements related to nondiscrimination on the basis of race, sex, and national origin in educational programs. Education for Native Hawaiians The Committee recommends $37,897,000 for the Education for Native Hawaiian program, which is $1,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request pro-poses to eliminate this program. Funds are used to provide com-petitive awards for supplemental education services to the Native Hawaiian population. The Committee recognizes that teacher shortages and related issues of poor recruitment, attrition, and retention disproportion-ately impact rural, impoverished, and urban communities, includ-ing those regions with a high population of Native Hawaiian stu-dents. Stronger pathways are needed between the K-12 school sys-tem and postsecondary institutions to support Native Hawaiian education by recruiting more underrepresented students to become teachers, increasing production of teachers through teacher pre- service programs, providing work-related growth and advancement for educators, and supporting coordinated mentorship, coaching, and induction processes. The Committee encourages the Depart-ment to foster stronger educational pathways between the K-12 school system and postsecondary institutions to improve teacher re-cruitment, training, and retention in the area of Native Hawaiian education. Alaska Native Education Equity The Committee recommends $35,953,000 for the Alaska Native Education Equity program, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request proposes to elimi-nate this program. Funds are used to provide competitive awards for supplemental education services to the Alaska Native popu-lation. Rural Education The Committee recommends $186,840,000 for Rural Education programs, which is $1,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 en-acted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request proposes to elimi-nate this program. There are two dedicated programs to assist rural school districts with improving teaching and learning in their schools: the Small, Rural Schools Achievement program, which pro-vides funds to rural districts that serve a small number of stu-dents; and the Rural and Low-Income Schools program, which pro-vides funds to rural districts that serve concentrations of poor stu-dents, regardless of the number of students served by the district. Funds appropriated for Rural Education shall be divided equally between these two programs. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, Committee recognizes that the Rural Education Achieve- ment Programs Rural and Low-Income School grant program has provided vital funding to rural schools across the country to ensure that regardless of geographic location, every child can have an ef-fective and comprehensive education. Therefore, any changes to the administration of the Rural and Low-Income School grant program should give schools losing grant funding previously received from the program a sufficient amount of time and guidance to pursue supplementary funding not less than one year. Comprehensive Centers The Committee recommends $52,000,000 for Comprehensive Centers, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request proposes to eliminate this pro-gram. The Comprehensive Centers program includes support for re-gional centers that provide training, technical assistance, and pro-fessional development to build State capacity to provide high-qual-ity education to all students. The Committee notes the critical role Comprehensive Centers play in helping States vet evidence and strategies to implement ESEA and provide children with a high- quality education. Student Support and Academic Enrichment State Grants The Committee recommends $1,220,000,000 for Student Support and Academic Enrichment (SSAE) State Grants, which is $10,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request proposes to eliminate this program. SSAE grants provide SEAs and LEAs with flexible resources that provide students with access to a well-rounded education, including rigorous coursework, and improve school conditions and the use of technology. The Committee encourages the Department to work with States and school districts that serve diverse youth to explore using SSAE funding to support and create youth pipeline programs in the arts and entertainment industries. The Committee is aware of programs that focus on closing student opportunity gaps by bringing filmmakers into Title I schools to partner with teachers to expand access to the arts, implement social and emotional learning strate-gies, and support rigorous academic curricula. A 2019 evaluation by the Stanford Center for Assessment, Learning, and Equity found that such programs create a positive environment and learning community, promote active and social learning, provide in-depth in-struction of vocabulary practices, and cultivate social and emo-tional learning competencies. The Committee supports efforts by States and LEAs to increase diversity in accelerated student learning programs, such as ad-vanced placement courses, gifted and talented classes and honors programs. The Committee supports the use of ESEA funding to cre-ate State or local equity offices. Equity offices could evaluate cur-rent data on the students enrolled in accelerated student learning programs and use such data to inform recommendations to LEAs on how to improve the diversity of those programs. The Committee recognizes that Black, Latino, and Native students, students living in poverty, and English Learners are historically underrepresented in accelerated learning programs. Research shows that developing VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, targeted recruitment and outreach plans, as well as universal screening for talented and gifted programs help address inequitable access that lock students out of opportunities that engage them more meaningfully in school and expand their postsecondary suc-cess. The Committee is concerned about the high rates of students who are chronically absent from school. The most recent statistics show that over seven million students in the 2015-2016 school year were considered chronically absent. Studies have shown that chron-ic absenteeism hurts students' academic achievement and can lead to students dropping out of school. In the fiscal year 2022 Congres-sional Budget Justification, the Committee directs the Department to describe State-driven efforts to combat chronic absenteeism. The Department's description can include relevant analysis such as which factors contribute most to student chronic absenteeism, and recommendations for Federal, State, and local strategies to prevent and address chronic absenteeism. The Committee is interested in chronic absenteeism trends by subgroups such as by gender, race, ethnicity, homeless, foster, English Learner status, and geography. The Committee urges the Department to make clear to State and local education agencies that they may leverage SSAE funding to address chronic absenteeism. The Committee continues to note that SEAs and LEAs can use SSAE funds for activities that contribute to a well-rounded edu-cation, including supports for safe, culturally responsive classroom communities. The Committee also notes that SEAs and LEAs can use SSAE funds to support and expand school-based mental health services including but not limited to providing trauma-informed care and mindfulness meditation. The Committee notes that States and school districts may use funds available under the SSAE grant program to strengthen in-struction in science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathe-matics (STEAM) fields, including computer science, and improve access to Pre-K-12 computer science and STEAM programming for underserved students, such as minorities, girls, and youth from families living at or below the poverty line. The Committee recog-nizes that supporting education in the STEAM fields, particularly computer science, is critical to ensuring that our nation continues to lead in innovation. As computer science is a basic skill in the 21st century global economy, the Committee intends for invest-ments in Title IV-A to reduce the computer science enrollment and achievement gaps. The explanatory statement accompanying the Department of Education Appropriations Act, 2020, directed the Department to in-clude in the fiscal year 2021 Congressional Budget Justification in-formation about the Department's plans for using the two percent set-aside for technical assistance and capacity building for sup-porting SEAs and LEAs in carrying out authorized activities under the SSAE program. The Committee notes the Department provided limited information in the fiscal year 2021 Congressional Budget Justification about some of its plans for fiscal year 2019 funds. However, the Department has not been fully transparent about its plans, nor has it been clear about how technical assistance and ca-pacity building funds directly support the technical assistance and capacity building needs of SEAs and LEAs. In fact, the Department VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, devoted approximately one-quarter of these funds for a new grant competition this year circumventing otherwise applicable rules regarding notice and comment procedures to support two to four grants to SEAs for course access programs that operate out-side of LEAs and allow students to choose courses through State- identified course providers. Such a program does nothing to ad-dress the challenges SEAs identified in a study of SSAE released by the Department earlier this year but merely advances a privat-ization agenda. The Committee directs the Department to include in its fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification and each subsequent Congressional Budget Justification information on current and planned expenditures for the two percent set-aside for technical as-sistance and capacity building, and include a plan for how re-sources will be spent to build the capacity of SEAs and LEAs and provide technical assistance. The plan should include how re-sources will be spent helping SEAs and LEAs vet evidence, imple-ment evidence-based interventions, and incorporate evidence-based SSAE activities into school improvement strategies. The Committee is supportive of SEA and LEA efforts to expand evidenced-based and scalable integrated student support systems by creating partnerships with existing school and community re-sources to deliver and track an individual tailored support plan for each student in a high-need school. The Committee notes that funds available under the SSAE grant program may be used to support such efforts, which can improve academic performance and graduation rates for students. INDIAN EDUCATION Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $180,739,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 180,739,000 ............................................................. 181,239,000 Change from ......................................................... +500,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +500,000 This account supports programs authorized by part A of title VI of the ESEA. Grants to Local Educational Agencies The Committee recommends $105,381,000 for Grants to Local Educational Agencies, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 en-acted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This program provides assistance through formula grants to school districts and schools supported or operated by the Bureau of Indian Education. The purpose of this program is to improve elementary and sec-ondary school programs that serve American Indian students, in-cluding preschool children. Grantees must develop a comprehensive plan and ensure that the programs they carry out will help Indian students reach the same challenging standards that apply to all students. This program supplements the regular school program to help American Indian children sharpen their academic skills, bol-ster their self-confidence, and participate in enrichment activities that would otherwise be unavailable. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $153,750,000 for the Bureau of Indian Education to address the im-pact of COVID-19 on students. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, Programs for Indian Children The Committee recommends $67,993,000 for Special Programs for Indian Children, which is the same as the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. These pro-grams make competitive awards to improve the quality of edu-cation for American Indian students. The program also funds the American Indian Teacher Corps and the American Indian Adminis-trator Corps to recruit and support American Indians as teachers and school administrators. National Activities The Committee recommends $7,858,000 for National Activities, which is $500,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The fiscal year 2021 increase to National Activities is directed to support the Department's Native American language immersion grant program. Within this account, funding is provided for grants to Tribes for education administrative planning, development, and coordination, grants to support Native language immersion schools and pro-grams. Funds under this authority also support research, evalua-tion and data collection to provide information about the edu-cational status of Indian students and the effectiveness of Indian education programs. INNOVATION AND IMPROVEMENT Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $1,103,815,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... - - - Committee Recommendation ............................................................. 1,074,815,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... \u00a529,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +1,074,815,000 The Committee recommends $1,074,815,000 for programs within the Innovation and Improvement account. Education Innovation and Research The Committee recommends $195,000,000 for the Education In- novation and Research (EIR) program, which is $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget re-quest proposes to eliminate this program. This program makes competitive grants to support the replication and scalingup of evidencebased education innovations. Within the total for EIR, the Committee recommendation in- cludes $110,000,000 to provide new grants for the initiative in so-cial and emotional learning (SEL) interventions and provide evi-dence-based, field-initiated innovations that address student social, emotional, and cognitive needs. The recently released National Commission on Social, Emotional and Academic Development re-port chronicles decades of research showing ''that the social, emo-tional, and cognitive dimensions of learning are deeply linked'' and that educating the whole student involves integrating and sus-taining these dimensions throughout the day. In addition, a recent study by the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning found that students who received SEL interventions showed lasting positive impacts on variables such as high school graduation rates and college attendance and lower likelihoods of being arrested or being diagnosed with a clinical mental health dis- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul order. Further, RAND Corporation finds that there are at least 60 SEL interventions that have been evaluated and that meet the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) evidence requirements. The Committee is encouraged by the robust, growing evidence base behind SEL strategies, trauma-informed services, and whole child approaches to learning, and makes funding for these inter-ventions a top priority. Children across the country have been sig-nificantly impacted by disruptions related to COVID-19, including school closures. The increase to EIR in fiscal year 2021 is intended to address these concerns and provide additional support for the SEL initiative, which can include trauma-informed practices and services within schools. Within 90 days of enactment of this Act, the Department is di- rected to brief the Committees on Appropriations on plans for car-rying out the SEL competition. In addition, the Department shall provide notice to the Committees at least seven days before grant-ees are announced. As part of the SEL initiative, the Committee encourages the De- partment to investigate opportunities to consider previous work done by the CDC and the Association for Supervision and Cur-riculum Development who together helped develop an integrated model called Whole School, Whole Community, Whole Child. The Department is encouraged to consider how cross-sector research collaboration and evidence-informed practice among researchers can provide informed implementation guidance relevant to all stakeholders. Nurses, psychologists and associated workers can have an important role in supporting students' emotional health as well as their physical health in school settings, and the Depart-ment is encouraged to explore supporting opportunities to promote such collaborations. In addition, within the total for EIR, the Committee rec- ommendation includes $85,000,000 for States, school districts, and school-based afterschool programs to provide or strengthen instruc-tion in STEAM fields, including computer science. In particular, these funds must be used by the Secretary to direct additional Pre- K-12 computer science and STEAM grants to underrepresented students such as minorities, girls, and youth from families living at or below the poverty line to help reduce the enrollment and achievement gap. Supporting education in the STEAM fields, par-ticularly computer science, is critical to ensure that our nation con-tinues to lead in innovation. As computer science is a basic skill in the 21st century global economy, the Committee encourages the Department to support Pre-K-12 computer science education in schools across the country. Funds should also be used within these amounts to increase teacher training, proficiency, and knowledge of STEAM and computer science courses, with a particular interest in coding. Given the significant Federal investment in the EIR program (and its predecessor program, Investing in Innovation), the Com-mittee directs the Department to take stronger steps to publicly re-lease and widely publicize the research findings from this critical program. More specifically, the Department should post research findings on its own website and issue related press releases and Dear Colleague letters. The Department should also provide sum-maries of the research findings to the Committees on Appropria- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul The Committee directs the Secretary to better showcase those programs that have demonstrated, through rigorous research as required by the ESEA, that their innovations show specific evi-dence of achievement in educational outcomes. The Department should also communicate any research findings that demonstrate successful outcomes to outside stakeholders, particularly chief State school officers and district superintendents. The Committee believes that publicizing these research findings will provide crit-ical information for State governments, State and local education agencies, and others, particularly in unserved and underserved communities. The Committee is aware that certain criteria for evaluating EIR grants, such as the use of randomized control trials, are more dif-ficult for rural-based applicants to successfully fulfill. The Com-mittee requests that the Department consider additional assistance for rural applicants in fulfilling evaluation requirements in future grant competitions. The Committee is aware that the Department has excluded non- profit institutions of higher education from participation in grant opportunities depending on their category of eligibility for a tax ex-emption. The Committee encourages the participation of all non-profit institutions of higher education regardless of the category of its tax-exempt designation. The Committee strongly opposes the Department's misguided ef- forts to fund EIR grants using its proposed Teacher-Directed Pro-fessional Learning Experiences priority. So much is already asked of our teachers who serve as instructional experts, counselors, and confidants for our nation's students. Asking teachers to navigate an uncharted, unregulated teacher professional development market is unreasonable and unwise. The Committee is concerned about the quality of the unvetted resources available to teachers online through popular websites. Reviewers in a recent Fordham Institute report found that most of these available materials are ''mediocre'' or ''probably not worth using.'' A better approach would be pro-viding school districts with resources to invest in high-quality, evi-dence-based professional development experiences. The EIR pro-gram is capable of doing so much more, and the Committee is dis-appointed to learn the Department is wasting taxpayer dollars on dubious approaches to teacher development. Teacher and School Leader Incentive Grants The Committee recommends $200,000,000 for the Teacher and School Leader Incentive Grants program, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request proposes to eliminate this program. This program provides grants to States, school districts, and partnerships to develop, implement, improve, or expand human capital management systems or per-formance-based compensation systems in schools. American History and Civics Academies The Committee recommends $2,315,000 for American History and Civics Academies, which is $500,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request proposes to eliminate this program. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, History and Civics National Activities The Committee recommends $3,500,000 for American History and Civics National Activities, which is $500,000 more than the fis-cal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request proposes to eliminate this program. The Committee supports efforts by school districts that are home to populations of Latino students to ensure public schools reflect the diversity of their districts, which may extend to the naming of schools to highlight the achievements of Latinos. Supporting Effective Educator Development The Committee recommends $80,000,000 for the Supporting Ef- fective Educator Development (SEED) grant program, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 level. The fiscal year 2021 budget re-quest proposes to eliminate this program. SEED provides competi-tive grants to support alternative certification and other profes-sional development and enrichment activities for teachers, prin-cipals, and other school leaders. Funds are included to fully sup-port continuation costs for grants made in prior years. The Committee is supportive of the Department's competitive preference priority for SEL in the fiscal year 2020 SEED competi-tion and directs the Department to include the competitive pref-erence priority in any new SEED competition in fiscal year 2021. The Committee recognizes the positive impact SEL has on aca- demic performance, classroom behavior, and student well-being. But studies have also shown that SEL school-based programs are more effective when they are supported by parent and family in-volvement. The Committee encourages the Department to support grantees that develop and implement teacher and school leader training programs on family engagement to increase the capacity of new and existing teachers and school leaders to work with fami-lies to collaboratively develop and support the social and emotional skills, habits, and mindsets of children. Efforts to promote family engagement could provide instruction of research-based, social and emotional skills, habits, and mindsets through locally relevant ma-terials that increase the SEL competencies and capacities of teach-ers, school leaders, and families. Such efforts could also provide teacher and school leader training and professional development on strategies to engage families and collectively support the develop-ment of the social and emotional skills, habits, and mindsets of families. Further, the Committee directs the Department to ensure that SEED grants are awarded to a diverse set of eligible entities, in-cluding national nonprofit organizations implementing evidence- based activities (as defined in section 8101(21)(A)(i) of the ESEA) across a number of sites which can help bring to scale evidence- based programs of national significance across the country. In addition, the Committee encourages the Department, through the SEED program, to fund projects that increase the number of teachers with computer science certifications with a priority to in-crease the number of such teachers in rural public schools and pub-lic schools serving high percentages of Native students. The Committee encourages the Department to ensure that SEED grants are awarded to a diverse set of eligible entities, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other Minority VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, that have a focus on improving teacher diver- sity and educational outcomes in urban or underserved commu-nities. The Committee recognizes the vital role in preparing educators so that all students have access to high-quality STEM learning op-portunities. The Committee further recognizes the value in a di-verse STEM teacher pipeline and encourages efforts to increase women in STEM teacher positions. The Committee supports improving civic education in the U.S. to ensure students understand the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and other founding and foundational documents including the Emancipation Proclamation. The Committee is aware that teacher subject matter expertise is a factor in student achievement. Accordingly, within SEED, the De-partment is encouraged to support evidence-based professional de-velopment that helps elementary and secondary educators increase civic knowledge of principles included in the U.S.'s founding and foundational documents. Charter Schools Grants The Committee recommends $400,000,000 for Charter School Program (CSP) Grants, which is $40,000,000 below the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request proposes to eliminate this program. CSP awards grants to SEAs or, if a State's SEA chooses not to participate, to charter school developers to support the develop-ment and initial implementation of public charter schools. State Facilities Incentive Grants and Credit Enhancement for Charter School Facilities awards help charter schools obtain adequate school facilities. These programs work in tandem to support the de-velopment and operation of charter schools. The Committee requests GAO to provide a report to the Commit- tees on Appropriations on the Department's oversight over CSP and whether the program is being implemented effectively among grantees and subgrantees. The report should include an analysis of CSP grant amounts over time that supported charter schools, with a particular focus on schools that eventually closed or received funds but never opened; the relationships between charter schools supported by CSP grants and charter management organizations; and an analysis of enrollment patterns at these schools, especially for students with disabilities. The report should examine ways to improve the Department's oversight of CSP as well as make rec-ommendations on potential legislative changes to the program that would reduce the potential for mismanagement and ineffective op-erations. Further, the Committee supports efforts by the Department's Of- fice of Inspector General (OIG) to examine grantee administration of Replication and Expansion Grants, including charter manage-ment organization grantees. The Committee also supports the OIG's efforts to evaluate whether the Department adequately mon-itored grantees' performance and uses of funds for CSP competi-tions. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul Schools Assistance The Committee recommends $109,000,000 for the Magnet Schools Assistance program, which is $2,000,000 more than the fis-cal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request proposes to eliminate this program. This program makes competi-tive grants to support the establishment and operation of magnet schools that are a part of a court-ordered or Federally-approved voluntary desegregation plan. The Committee encourages the Department to prioritize Magnet School Assistance applications that are paired with Department of Housing and Urban Development Choice Neighborhoods planning or implementation grants. The Supreme Court's landmark 1954 ruling in Brown v. Board of Education declared separate but equal public schools to be un- constitutional. Yet, according to a 2016 GAO audit, public edu-cation is more segregated by race and class than at any time since 1960. The Committee is concerned by the resegregation of public schools and believes that the 2015 enactment of ESSA presents a valuable opportunity to support State and school district efforts to improve student diversity as a means of achieving equity of edu-cational opportunity. Further, the evidence base in support of in-creasing student diversity as a means of school improvement is ex-tensive, which is why the Committee continues to support the Mag-net School Assistance program. The Committee recognized a longstanding barrier to the imple- mentation of this work in the Department of Education Appropria-tions Act, 2019, when it removed two decades-old prohibitions on the use of Federal funds for transportation costs to carry out school desegregation efforts. However, the Committee recognizes that bar-riers to this work persist due to Section 426 of the General Edu-cation Provisions Act. It is concerning to the Committee that such legislative language has remained in place since 1974 as an obsta-cle when many school districts are working voluntarily to promote racial and economic integration for the benefit of their children and communities. Therefore, new bill language is included to rid the Federal code of this outdated prohibition. Ready to Learn Programming The Committee recommends $30,000,000 for Ready to Learn Pro- gramming, which is $1,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 en-acted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request proposes to elimi-nate this program. This program supports the development and distribution of educational video programming for preschool and el-ementary school children and their parents, caregivers, and teach-ers. Arts in Education The Committee recommends $31,000,000 for Arts in Education, which is $1,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request proposes to eliminate this program. Thisprogram provides competitive grants to support professional development and the development of instructional materials and programming that integrate the arts into the curricula. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, Talented Education The Committee recommends $14,000,000 for the Javits Gifted and Talented Education Program, which is $1,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget re-quest proposes to eliminate this program. Funds are awarded through grants and contracts to States, schools districts, and other organizations to support a coordinated program of research, dem-onstration projects, innovative strategies, and other activities to help schools identify gifted and talented students and address their unique educational needs. The Committee encourages the Department to use funds to in- crease the number of grants that assist schools in the identification of, and provision of services to, gifted and talented students who may not be identified and served through traditional assessment methods, such as children with disabilities, English learners, chil-dren of color, and economically disadvantaged students. Statewide Family Engagement Centers The Committee recommends $10,000,000 for the State- wide Family Engagement Centers program, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2020 budget re-quest proposes to eliminate the program. Funds are awarded through grants to organizations to provide technical assistance and training to State and local educational agencies in the implementa-tion and enhancement of systemic and effective family engagement policies, programs, and activities that lead to improvements in stu-dent development and academic achievement. SAFE SCHOOLS AND CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $210,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... - - - Committee Recommendation ............................................................. 218,000,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +8,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +218,000,000 The Committee recommends a total of $218,000,000 for activities to promote safe schools, healthy students, and citizenship edu-cation, which is $8,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $218,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 budget re-quest. Promise Neighborhoods The Committee recommends $82,000,000 for Promise Neighbor- hoods, which is $2,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request proposes to eliminate this program. Promise Neighborhoods supports grants to nonprofit, community-based organizations for the development of comprehen-sive neighborhood programs designed to combat the effects of pov-erty and improve educational outcomes for children and youth, from birth through college. School Safety National Activities The Committee recommends $106,000,000 for School Safety Na- tional Activities, which is $1,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request proposes to eliminate this program. The Committee's recommendation provides VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul for the Project School Emergency Response to Vio- lence (Project SERV) program. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $100,000,000 for Project SERV to help elementary and secondary schools and institutions of higher education respond to the imme-diate needs of COVID-19 and the effect on students. Within School Safety National Activities, the Committee includes sufficient funding to continue the Mental Health Demonstration Grant and the Mental Health Personnel Grant competition, first initiated by the Committee in fiscal year 2020, to increase the number of well-trained school counselors, social workers, and psy-chologists, or other mental health professionals qualified to provide school-based mental health services. The Project SERV program provides counseling and referral to mental health services as well as other education-related services to LEAs and IHEs in which the learning environment has been dis-rupted by a violent or traumatic crisis. The Committee directs the Department to report to the Committees on Appropriations within 180 days of enactment of this Act on how fiscal years 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 grant recipients used Project SERV funds; rec-ommendations from grant recipients on how the program could be improved; and, information on how these funds helped them re-cover from a violent or traumatic crisis. The Committee is concerned about the possible mental, emo- tional, and behavioral health effects on students and staff resulting from lockdown drills and active shooter drills conducted in elemen-tary and secondary schools. In response, the Committee provides $1,000,000 for the Department to enter into an agreement with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (Na-tional Academies) under which the National Academies will con-duct a study to assess the science on the potential mental, emo-tional, and behavioral health effects of firearm violence prevention activities on students and staff in elementary and secondary school settings. The study and subsequent report should include an anal-ysis of the effects of active shooter simulations, full-scale lockdowns, secured-perimeter lockouts, and other school security measures (e.g. metal detectors, visibility of police/policing on cam-pus) and their mental, emotional and behavioral consequences. The assessment should review the potential effects on children and youth of different ages and on students with disabilities. The Na-tional Academies report should identify practices and procedures that can minimize any adverse mental, emotional, and behavioral health effects on children, youth, and staff in elementary and sec-ondary schools resulting from the drills and make recommenda-tions where appropriate. The Committee encourages the Department to continue to oper- ate grants and technical assistance that support LEA and school building efforts to promote a safe, supportive, and positive school climate. This includes initiatives such as implementing effective discipline strategies such as positive behavior interventions and supports and restorative practices; improving access to comprehen-sive mental health services; fostering positive relationships; and, anti-bullying initiatives and efforts to reduce school violence. A positive school climate is the cornerstone to a safe and supportive school environment, and the Committee encourages the Depart- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul to continue efforts to promote proactive and evidence-based efforts to foster a positive school climate that benefits all students, as opposed to simply attempting to stop rare acts of school violence. Full-Service Community Schools The Committee recommends $30,000,000 for Full-Service Com- munity Schools, which is $5,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request proposes to eliminate this program. This program makes competitive grants to support school-based comprehensive services for students, families, and communities. The Full-Service Community Schools program, which supports evidence-based models to meet the holistic needs of chil-dren and families, is part of the Committee's continued initiative to provide resources for SEL. The Committee is also encouraged by research that shows comprehensive community schools as a strat-egy that can improve educational quality and equity for students from diverse backgrounds. Therefore, the Committee urges the De-partment to provide technical assistance to SEAs and LEAs that are interested in leveraging Full-Service Community Schools grants to meet local school improvement needs. ENGLISH LANGUAGE ACQUISITION Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $787,400,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... - - - Committee Recommendation ............................................................. 797,400,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +10,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +797,400,000 This program provides formula grants to States to serve Limited English Proficient (LEP) students. Grants are based on each State's share of the National LEP students and recent immigrant student population. Funds under this account also support professional de-velopment to increase the pool of teachers prepared to serve LEP students as well as evaluation activities. The bill continues lan-guage to calculate all State awards based on a three-year average of data from the American Community Survey. The Committee recommends $797,400,000 for English Language Acquisition (ELA) in fiscal year 2021, which is $10,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget re-quest proposes to eliminate this program. The Committee understands that the nation's English learner (EL) student population is rapidly growing and becoming more di-verse. The Committee is deeply concerned by the academic achieve-ment gap that persists between ELs and their peers and under-stands that addressing this challenge has been difficult for many States. These States rely on Federal technical assistance in crafting and administering their State and local plans under Title III of the ESEA, and the Committee recognizes the need to provide them with timely, accurate guidance. The Office of English Language Ac-quisition (OELA) already disseminates research and resources for teaching ELs and has the expertise needed to provide this guidance to States. Therefore, the Committee directs all assistance duties re-quired under section 6823(f) of the ESEA to be conducted by OELA. The Committee is supportive of the Department's ongoing activi- ties to study uses of funds for the ELA program, effective practices for ELs, professional development for teachers of ELs, and how VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, teacher residency programs impact ELs. The Committee is also supportive of the Department's efforts to publish more detailed out-comes for EL students; however, the Committee notes that the De-partment does not currently collect outcome data for EL students by all ethnic and racial subgroups. The Committee strongly urges the Department to consider collecting disaggregated outcomes data to present a more complete picture of academic achievement for di-verse ELs. The Committee is concerned by the quality and availability of data for EL students on State report cards as required under ESEA and directs the Department to develop a plan to ensure States are clearly presenting required data elements for EL students in fiscal year 2021 and subsequent years. The Department is directed to share its plan with the Committees on Appropriations and provide a briefing within 270 days of enactment of this Act. In particular, the Committee is concerned about data for former EL students and urges the Department to address gaps and collect more complete information for this subgroup. The Committee directs the Depart-ment to report on its progress in responding to this request in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification. The Committee is aware that children and youth who relocate from the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, where Spanish is the pri-mary language of instruction, to one of the 50 States or the District of Columbia are not counted in the statutory formula used to make English Language Acquisition allotments to States, set forth in sec-tion 3111(c) of the ESEA. SPECIAL EDUCATION Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $13,885,228,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 13,985,228,000 ............................................................. 14,092,995,000 Change from ......................................................... +207,767,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +107,767,000 Of the total amount available, $4,553,979,000 is available for ob- ligation on July1, 2021, and $9,283,383,000 is available for obliga-tion on October 1, 2021. These grants help States and localities pay for a free, appropriate education for students with disabilities aged 3 through 21. Grants to States This program provides formula grants to assist States in meeting the costs of providing special education and related services to chil- dren with disabilities. States generally transfer most of the funds to LEAs; however, they can reserve some funds for program moni-toring, technical assistance, and other related activities. In order to be eligible for funds, States must make free appropriate public edu-cation available to all children with disabilities. The Committee recommends $12,957,892,000 for Part B Grants to States, which is $193,500,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 en-acted level and $93,500,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget re-quest. The Committee is concerned that the Federal share of the excess cost of educating students with disabilities has declined and notes the critical role increased funding plays in helping to reverse this trend. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, The Committee encourages the Department to address the unique needs of students who use American Sign Language (ASL). The Committee directs the Department to assess the needs of, and identify ways to better serve, students who use ASL and to share findings with the Committee in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification. Preschool Grants The Committee recommends $397,620,000 for Preschool Grants, which is $3,500,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. These funds provide addi-tional assistance to States to help them make free, appropriate public education available to children with disabilities ages 3 through 5. Grants for Infants and Families The Committee recommends $481,850,000 for Grants for Infants and Families, which is $4,850,000 above the fiscal year 2020 en-acted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. These funds provide additional assistance to States to help them make free, ap-propriate public education available to children with disabilities from birth through age 2. The Committee recommendation includes new bill language to clarify that States may use funds to support subgrants to non-prof-it and other organizations for State activity work under IDEA Part C. IDEA National Activities The Committee recommends $255,633,000 for the IDEA National Activities program, which is $5,917,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The IDEA National Activities programs support State efforts to improve early intervention and education results for children with disabil-ities. Educational Technology, Media, and Materials. \u2014The Committee recommends $29,547,000 for Educational Technology, Media, and Materials, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2020 budget request. This program makes com-petitive awards to support the development, demonstration, and use of technology and educational media activities of educational value to children with disabilities. The Committee continues to recognize the ongoing progress made with the tools and services provided under this program that have allowed more than 620,000 students with disabilities free access to more than 700,000 books in digitally accessible formats. The Com-mittee strongly encourages continued effort to expand this pro-gram's reach to K-12 students in underserved areas. Parent Information Centers. \u2014The Committee recommends $27,411,000 for Parent Information Centers, which is the same as the 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This program makes awards to parent organizations to support Parent Training and Information Centers, including community parent resource centers. These centers provide training and infor-mation to meet the needs of parents of children with disabilities living in the areas served by the centers, particularly underserved VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, parents of children who may be inappropriately identi- fied. Technical assistance is also provided under this program for developing, assisting, and coordinating centers receiving assistance under this program. Personnel Preparation. \u2014The Committee recommends $90,700,000 for Personnel Preparation, which is $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This program supports competitive awards to help address State-identified needs for qualified personnel to work with children with disabilities, and to ensure that those personnel have the nec-essary skills and knowledge to serve children with special needs. Awards focus on addressing the need for leadership and personnel to serve low-incidence populations. Funds are included to fully sup-port continuation costs for grants made in prior years. The Com-mittee notes the critical role the Personnel Preparation program plays in helping to address the nation's shortage of teachers for students with disabilities. Given the critical shortage of special education teachers, includ- ing the higher education special education faculty who prepare them, the Committee includes no less than $10,000,000 for doc-toral-level personnel preparation in special education. State Personnel Development. \u2014The Committee recommends $38,630,000 for State Personnel Development, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This program supports grants to States to assist with im-proving personnel preparation and professional development re-lated to early intervention and educational and transition services that improve outcomes for students with disabilities. Funds are in-cluded to fully support continuation costs for grants made in prior years. Technical Assistance and Dissemination. \u2014The Committee rec- ommends $44,345,000 for Technical Assistance and Dissemination, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fis-cal year 2021 budget request. Funding supports technical assist-ance, demonstration projects, and information dissemination. These funds support efforts by State and local educational agencies, IHEs, and other entities to build State and local capacity to make sys-temic changes and improve results for children with disabilities. Special Olympics Education Programs. \u2014The Committee rec- ommends $25,000,000 for Special Olympics Education Programs, an increase of $4,917,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request, to support activities au-thorized by the Special Olympics Sport and Empowerment Act, in-cluding Project UNIFY. This funding supports efforts to expand Special Olympics programs and the design and implementation of Special Olympics education programs that can be integrated into classroom instruction and are consistent with academic content standards. REHABILITATION SERVICES Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $3,747,739,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 3,782,952,000 ............................................................. 3,827,500,000 Change from +79,761,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +44,548,000 VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 in this account are authorized by the Rehabilita- tion Act of 1973, the Helen Keller National Center Act, and the Randolph-Sheppard Act. Vocational Rehabilitation State Grants The Committee recommends $3,667,801,000 in mandatory fund- ing for Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) State Grants, which is $57,761,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This program supports vocational rehabilitation services through formula grants to States. These grants support a wide range of services designed to help persons with physical and mental disabil-ities prepare for and engage in gainful employment to the extent of their capabilities. Emphasis is placed on providing vocational re-habilitation services to persons with the most significant disabil-ities. The Committee's recommendation provides the cost-of-living adjustment for Vocational Rehabilitation Grants to States, as au-thorized. Client Assistance State Grants The Committee recommends $13,000,000 for Client Assistance State Grants, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Client Assistance State Grants support services for eligible individuals and appli-cants of the VR State Grants program, and other programs, projects, and services funded under the Rehabilitation Act. These formula grants are used to help persons with disabilities overcome problems with the service delivery system and improve their under-standing of services available to them under the Rehabilitation Act. Training The Committee recommends $29,388,000 for the Training pro- gram, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The program supports long- term and short-term training, in-service personnel training, and training of interpreters for deaf persons. Projects in a broad array of disciplines are funded to ensure that skilled personnel are avail-able to serve the vocational needs of persons with disabilities. Funds are included to fully support continuation costs for grants made in prior years. Demonstration and Training Programs The Committee recommends $5,796,000 for Demonstration and Training Programs, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 en-acted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. These pro-grams support activities designed to increase employment opportu-nities for individuals with disabilities by expanding and improving the availability and provision of rehabilitation and other services. The Committee recommendation includes no less than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level for parent information and training pro-grams. Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights The Committee recommends $18,650,000 for Protection and Ad- vocacy of Individual Rights, which is $1,000,000 more than the fis- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Grants are awarded to entities that have the authority to pursue legal, administrative, and other appropriate remedies to protect and advocate for the rights of persons with disabilities. Supported Employment State Grants The Committee recommends $22,548,000 for Supported Employ- ment State Grants, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 en-acted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request proposes to elimi-nate this program. These formula grants assist States in devel-oping collaborative programs with public agencies and nonprofit agencies for training and post-employment services leading to sup-ported employment. In supported employment programs, persons with the most significant disabilities are given special supervision and assistance to enable them to work in integrated settings. Independent Living Services for Older Individuals Who Are Blind The Committee recommends $33,317,000 for Independent Living Services for Older Individuals Who Are Blind, which is the same as both the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Funds are distributed to States according to a for-mula based on the population of individuals who are 55 or older and provide support for services to persons 55 years old or over whose severe visual impairment makes gainful employment ex-tremely difficult to obtain, but for whom independent living goals are feasible. Helen Keller National Center The Committee recommends $17,000,000 for the Helen Keller National Center for Deaf-Blind Youth and Adults, which is $1,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fis-cal year 2021 budget request. These funds are used for the oper-ation of a national center that provides intensive services for deaf- blind individuals and their families at Sands Point, New York, and a network of ten regional offices that provide referral, counseling, transition services, and technical assistance to service providers. Temporary Grants to Blind Vendors The Committee recommendation includes $20,000,000 to help the Randolph-Sheppard program recover from the COVID-19 emer-gency. The Randolph-Sheppard Act provides a priority for blind people in every State to operate businesses called ''vending facili-ties,'' located on Federal property and serving Federal employees and the public. State laws extend these opportunities for the blind to State, county, and municipal property, as well. An agency has been designated in each State to license blind vendors, identify suitable vending locations for the blind, and to administer the pro-gram under Federal and State regulations. SPECIAL INSTITUTIONS FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $249,292,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 249,292,000 ............................................................. 253,792,000 Change from +4,500,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +4,500,000 VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 $253,792,000 for Special Institu- tions for Persons with Disabilities, which is $4,500,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget re-quest. AMERICAN PRINTING HOUSE FOR THE BLIND Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $32,431,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 32,431,000 ............................................................. 32,931,000 Change from ......................................................... +500,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +500,000 This funding subsidizes the production of educational materials for legally blind persons enrolled in pre-college programs. The American Printing House for the Blind (Printing House), which is chartered by the Commonwealth of Kentucky, manufactures and maintains an inventory of educational materials in accessible for-mats that are distributed free of charge to schools and States based on the number of blind students in each State. The Printing House also conducts research and field activities to inform educators about the availability of materials and how to use them. The Committee commends the Printing House for ensuring that students who are blind and visually impaired are able to benefit from the latest educational technologies. The increase in funding will help provide accessible technologies developed for students who are blind and visually impaired that are comparable to those avail-able to their sighted peers, thus enabling students with vision loss to take advanced class work, achieve academic success, and obtain gainful employment. NATIONAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE FOR THE DEAF Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $79,500,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 79,500,000 ............................................................. 81,000,000 Change from ......................................................... +1,500,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +1,500,000 Congress established the National Technical Institute for the Deaf (Institute) in 1965 to provide a residential facility for postsec-ondary technical training and education for deaf persons with the purpose of promoting the employment of these individuals. The In-stitute also conducts applied research and provides training related to various aspects of deafness. The Secretary of Education admin-isters these activities through a contract with the Rochester Insti-tute of Technology in Rochester, New York. GALLAUDET UNIVERSITY Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $137,361,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 137,361,000 ............................................................. 139,861,000 Change from +2,500,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +2,500,000 Gallaudet is a private, non-profit educational institution Feder- ally chartered in 1864 providing elementary, secondary, under-graduate, and continuing education for deaf persons. In addition, the University offers graduate programs in fields related to deaf-ness for deaf and hearing students, conducts research on deafness, and provides public service programs for deaf persons. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, Act (P.L. 116-136) included $7,000,000 for Gallaudet University to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus, including support for students. CAREER , TECHNICAL , AND ADULT EDUCATION Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $1,960,686,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 2,723,265,000 ............................................................. 1,985,686,000 Change from ......................................................... +25,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a5737,579,000 This account includes vocational education programs authorized by the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006, as recently reauthorized by the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, and the Adult Edu-cation and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA). Career and Technical Education: State Grants The Committee recommends $1,300,598,000 for Career and Tech- nical Education (CTE) State Grants, which is $18,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $662,000,000 less than the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Of these funds, $509,598,000 will become available on July 1, 2021, and $791,000,000 will become available for obligation on October 1, 2021. State Grants support a variety of career and technical education programs developed in accordance with the State plan. This pro-gram focuses Federal resources on institutions with high concentra-tions of low-income students. The populations assisted by State Grants range from secondary students in prevocational courses to adults who need retraining to adapt to changing technological and labor markets. Funding for State Grants will continue support for state-of-the art career and technical training to students in sec-ondary schools and community and technical colleges. National Programs The Committee recommends $7,421,000 for National Programs, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $82,579,000 less than the fiscal year 2021 budget request. In keep-ing with the purpose of the National Programs, the Committee rec-ommendation includes sufficient funding to support the conduct and dissemination of research in career and technical education. Cybersecurity. \u2014The Committee recognizes the cybersecurity threats facing our nation's critical infrastructure sectors and the need for workers in these industries, including those who operate cyber physical systems, to be equipped with skills to keep systems secure. The Committee acknowledges that many of these operators are educated through CTE programs that prominently feature a culture of physical safety but do not incorporate cybersecurity skills. Therefore, the Committee encourages the Secretary to use Carl D. Perkins CTE Innovation and Modernization Grants to sup-port the development of CTE programs that integrate cybersecurity and help prepare students for careers in critical infrastructure sec-tors. Moreover, the Committee recognizes the cybersecurity threats facing our nation's critical infrastructure industries and the need for workers in these industries, including those who operate cyber physical systems, to be equipped with skills to keep systems secure. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, Improved Coordination between Career and Technical Education and Adult Education. \u2014More than 36 million U.S. adults of work- ing age have low foundational education and literacy skills making it difficult for them to use their full range of talents and abilities on the job. This reflects a significant population of workers who could contribute more if they had opportunities to build skills that local businesses need. To ensure that these individuals can succeed in today's economy, the Committee encourages the Department to identify and pursue opportunities to better align the postsecondary CTE system with the adult education system. Adult education can be an effective on-ramp to postsecondary CTE and a valuable part-ner in designing and implementing integrated education and train-ing (IET) models that blend basic skills instruction and occupa-tional training to expand equitable access to skills training, high- quality credentials and family supporting careers. Workforce training. \u2014The Department is encouraged to work with the Departments of Labor and Commerce to expand workforce training and certifications to communities disproportionately im-pacted by high unemployment and low postsecondary education at-tainment rates. Youth Entrepreneurship and Financial Literacy. \u2014The Committee recognizes the importance of preparing our students for the 21st century workforce through CTE programs, including entrepreneur-ship and financial literacy. The Committee directs the Secretary to provide technical assistance and make resources available to help LEAs and IHEs prepare students for employment and attain high- skilled jobs through the implementation of entrepreneurship and fi-nancial literacy programs during and after school, including efforts to partner with community organizations. The Committee requests an update on these efforts in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification. Adult Basic and Literacy Education State Grants The Committee recommends $663,955,000 for Adult Basic and Literacy Education State Grants, which is $7,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. State formula grants, authorized under the AEFLA, sup-port programs to enable adults to acquire basic literacy skills, to enable those who so desire to complete secondary education, and to make available to adults the means to become more employable, productive, and responsible citizens. Adult Education National Leadership Activities The Committee recommends $13,712,000 for National Leadership Activities, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This program supports ap-plied research, development, dissemination, evaluation, and pro-gram improvement efforts to strengthen the quality of adult edu-cation services. The Committee encourages the provision of technical assistance to States to foster and scale IET models by ensuring collaboration with CTE providers. IET is a service approach that provides adult education and literacy activities concurrently and contextually with workforce preparation for a specific occupation or occupational clus-ter for the purpose of educational and career advancement. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, ASSISTANCE Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $24,520,352,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 22,975,352,000 ............................................................. 24,565,352,000 Change from ......................................................... +45,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +1,590,000,000 Pell Grants The Committee recommends $22,475,352,000 in discretionary funding for the Pell Grant program, which is the same as both the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget re-quest. These funds will support Pell grants to students for the 2021-2022 academic year. Combined with mandatory funding streams, the Committee rec- ommendation supports a maximum Pell Grant in academic year 2021-2022 of $6,495, a $150 increase over fiscal year 2020 and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The increase will help the max-imum grant keep pace with inflation, according to the Congres-sional Budget Office's January 2020 economic assumptions. Pell Grants help to ensure access to educational and economic opportunities for low- and middle-income students by providing need-based financial assistance. Grants are determined according to a statutory formula, which considers income, assets, household size, and the number of family members in college, among other factors. Pell Grants are the foundation of Federal postsecondary student aid programs. Pell Grants for Incarcerated Individuals. \u2014The Committee is deeply concerned about high recidivism rates and a shortage of postsecondary educational opportunities for low-income, incarcer-ated individuals in the U.S. Since 1994, States have been forced to reduce or permanently remove postsecondary correctional edu-cation programs. According to the American Correctional Associa-tion, States offering such postsecondary correctional education pro-grams dropped from 37 in 1994 to only 12 in 2015. This is particu-larly troubling as our nation's Federal prison population has in-creased by nearly 50 percent over the same period. The Committee recognizes that access to postsecondary correc- tional education programs significantly reduces recidivism, helps break down racial barriers that are a common cause of disciplinary problems in the prison system, and increases access to employment for individuals who have been incarcerated. Therefore, the Com-mittee includes new bill language that overrides a prohibition pre-venting students who are incarcerated from receiving a Pell Grant. In addition, the bill language includes important guardrails ensur-ing that students who are incarcerated receive accurate informa-tion and helpful supports in pursuing their postsecondary edu-cation. The Committee supports the work of the Department's Second Chance Pell Experimental Sites initiative, which is testing how ex-panding access to financial aid improves outcomes for individuals who are incarcerated. The Committee commends the Institute of Education Sciences for conducting a rigorous evaluation of the Sec-ond Chance Pell Experimental Site, as directed by the explanatory statement accompanying the Department of Education Appropria-tions Act, 2020. Such study will provide critical information regard- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul ing the benefits of providing members of society a second chance through the Pell Grant program. Pell Grant Eligibility. \u2014The Committee acknowledges the hard- ships and financial barriers faced by students in pursuit of their baccalaureate and postbaccalaureate degrees. The current lifetime eligibility unit (LEU) of 12 semesters may present certain chal-lenges to students who, due to the rising cost of college and other social circumstances, must work while pursuing their degree, care for family, or take time off from their studies as a result of these responsibilities. Further, the Committee recognizes the lack of fi-nancial assistance and resources available for first generation grad-uate students who may face similar challenges. Therefore, the Committee directs the Department to provide a report within 270 days of enactment of this Act, detailing how many undergraduate students reach the Pell LEU threshold and are no longer able to receive a Pell Grant, including the institutional control and type of the college or university attended, the enrollment status of such students, and their academic progress upon reaching the threshold. In addition, such report must also include a discussion of how stu-dents who have not exceeded the LEU limit could benefit from using their remaining Pell eligibility to pursue postbaccalaureate studies, particularly focusing on historically underrepresented pop-ulations or groups. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants The Committee recommends $880,000,000 for the Federal Sup- plemental Educational Opportunity Grants (SEOG) program, which is $15,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request proposes to eliminate this program. SEOG provides funds to postsecondary institutions for need- based grants of up to $4,000 to undergraduate students, with pri-ority given to students who are Pell-eligible. Approximately 68percent of dependent recipients have annual family incomes under $30,000 and nearly 71 percent of independent SEOG recipi-ents have annual family incomes under $20,000. Institutions must contribute a 25 percent match toward their SEOG allocation. Federal Work-Study The Committee recommends $1,210,000,000 for the Federal Work-Study program, which is $30,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $710,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Federal Work-Study funds are provided through institutions to students who work part-time. The funds assist with paying for the cost of education. Approximately 3,200 colleges and universities re-ceive funding, according to a statutory formula, and may allocate it for job location and development centers. Work-study jobs must pay at least the Federal minimum wage and institutions must pro-vide 25 percent of student earnings. The Committee recommendation continues funding for the Work Colleges program, which supports institutions that require all resi-dent students to participate in a work-learning program. Resources for First Generation College Students. \u2014First genera- tion students comprise nearly a third of all college students, yet there is a lack of dedicated support services to ensure successful VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, for such students. Given the Department's vested interest in ensuring successful outcomes for first generation students, the Committee directs the Department to provide a report to the Com-mittees on Appropriations, within 180 days of enactment of this Act, on improving the effectiveness of current Federal financial aid policy in supporting first generation students. For-profit College Accountability. \u2014For-profit colleges prey on servicemembers and veterans with aggressive marketing and re-cruiting because of a loophole that allows for-profit colleges to ex-clude from the cap on federally derived institutional revenue any Federal aid and educational benefits from sources other than the Department of Education. In addition, a recent study of for-profit institutions receiving GI Bill benefits found that these institutions spend little of their revenue on academic instruction, with the lead-ing recipients spending fifteen percent or less of their revenue on instruction. The 85/15 Rule was first implemented in 1992 as a bipartisan amendment to the Higher Education Act (HEA). It is based on the rationale that if an institution provides a quality education, indi-viduals without access to Federal funding sources should be willing to pay for it. The rule prevented for-profit postsecondary institu-tions from deriving more than 85 percent of revenues from Title IV of the HEA. It was based on a longstanding principle first enacted in 1952 to protect veterans from for-profit college abuses dating back to the original GI Bill, the Servicemen's Readjustment Act, in 1944, and was in response to widespread reports that many for- profit colleges were using aggressive, sometimes fraudulent recruit-ing tactics in order to profit off of students with access to Federal student aid funding. In 1992, the rule was amended to allow for- profits to derive an extra five percent of their revenue from Title IV and became known as the 90/10 Rule. Since that time, thou-sands of students have been defrauded by schools that have since gone out of business. Students who graduate from these schools can obtain degrees that often offer little value. A 2016 National Bureau of Economic Research study using data from the Department and the Internal Revenue Service found that the earnings of students who attend for-profit colleges or universities are lower than if they had never enrolled at all. And while the for-profit college sector en-rolls only nine percent of all students, 33 percent of all borrower who defaulted on student loans attend for-profit colleges. Given these deeply disappointing outcomes, the Committee be- lieves that reverting back to the 85/15 ratio and closing the loop-hole is a critical step in holding for-profit colleges accountable and protecting students from predatory practices and taxpayer dollars from being wasted. Therefore, the Committee includes new bill lan-guage requiring that for-profit institutions of higher education re-ceive not more than 85 percent of their revenue from Federal sources and that all Federal education assistance funds are counted in the ratio. In addition, in House Report 116-62, the Committee directed the Department to produce an analysis of all for-profit institutions who would exceed the 90/10 Federal funding limits if revenue from the Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD) were in-cluded in the 90/10 calculation. The Committee is disappointed that, to date, the Department has not provided such an analysis to VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, the Committee and notes that the Department was capable of and produced a similar report in 2016. Ability to Benefit. \u2014The Committee supports the Ability to Ben- efit provision in the HEA, which allows students to pursue a higher education without a high school diploma and receive Federal finan-cial aid. The Committee encourages the Department to maximize this opportunity and conduct outreach efforts to ensure that more individuals are aware of this opportunity and able to utilize this provision and pursue a higher education. F EDERAL DIRECT STUDENT LOAN PROGRAM ACCOUNT Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $50,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... - - - Committee Recommendation ............................................................. 50,000,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... - - - Change from budget request ...................................................... +50,000,000 The Committee recommendation includes $50,000,000 for the Federal Direct Student Loan Program Account program (also known as Temporary Extended Public Service Loan Forgiveness or TEPSLF). Congress created the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program in 2007 to provide loan relief to borrowers pur-suing careers in public service. After making 120 qualifying pay-ments, the equivalent of 10 years, borrowers first became eligible for forgiveness under the program in 2017. While 150,545 bor-rowers believed they qualified for loan forgiveness and submitted applications, as of April 2020, only 2,215 borrowers have had their discharges processed by the Department under PSLF. TEPSLF was established to address the administrative failures of the Department and student loan servicers, who did not provide accurate information to borrowers seeking to qualify under the PSLF program. This account provides funding for loan forgiveness for borrowers who were led to believe they qualified for PSLF by their loan servicers but were denied forgiveness. Unfortunately, the Department has failed to effectively administer this program as well. According to recent data from the Department, over 30,000 borrowers applied for relief under TEPSLF as of April 2020, but only 1,826 applications were approved. The Committee remains concerned about the Department's ad- ministration of PSLF, particularly with respect to qualifying em-ployment determinations and qualifying payment calculations. The Committee directs the Department to refrain from reversing any qualifying employment determination already issued that declared employment as satisfactory for inclusion in the program. The Com-mittee further directs the Department to calculate multiple pay-ments made to a loan servicer within a payment period that com-bine to result in the payment amount total required for the pay-ment period to be counted as a qualifying payment toward the 120 payments required by the program. The Committee supports the Department's recent announcement to consolidate the PSLF and TEPLSF applications and encourages further actions that help borrowers navigate the program without unnecessary bureaucratic burden. The Committee directs the De-partment to ensure that this change to the TEPSLF program is properly communicated to borrowers along with a notification that reiterates all PSLF qualification requirements. The Committee also VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, directs the Department to include an update in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification identifying areas where the De-partment has improved the administration of the PSLF and TEPSLF programs and what more can be done. The Department shall brief the Committees on Appropriations within 60 days of enactment of this Act on actions planned or taken: (1) to address and implement recommendations outlined in a GAO report entitled ''Public Service Loan Forgiveness: Improving the Temporary Expanded Process Could Help Reduce Borrower Confusion'' (GA0-19-595); (2) to provide more information to bor-rowers denied TEPSLF on the reason for the denial; (4) to conduct outreach to borrowers who may be eligible for TEPSLF; and (5) to improve administration of the PSLF program, including by imple-menting GAO's recommendations for that program. The Committee notes that many physicians are excluded from re- ceiving forgiveness under section 455(m)(3) of the HEA as they are prohibited from direct employment with private, non-physician, cor-porate entities within their States. As such, the Committee encour-ages the Secretary to provide full-time borrowers who are engaged in health care practitioner occupations in such States, including California and Texas, with loan cancellations that are consistent with the Department's ongoing loan cancellations for health care practitioners across the country. S TUDENT AIDADMINISTRATION Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $1,768,943,000 Budget year 2021 ....................................................... 1,883,309,000 Committee Recommendation ............................................................. 1,768,943,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... - - - Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a5114,366,000 Programs administered under the Student Aid Administration (SAA) include Pell Grants, campus-based programs, Teacher Edu-cation Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) grants, and Federal student loan programs. Salaries and Expenses. \u2014Within the total provided for SAA, the Committee recommends $878,943,000 for salaries and expenses, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $269,661,000 below the fiscal year 2021 request. Loan Servicing Activities. \u2014Within the total provided for SAA, the Committee recommends $890,000,000 for Loan Servicing Ac-tivities, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $155,295,000 above the fiscal year 2021 request. The Committee held a hearing at the beginning of the 116th Congress to conduct oversight of student loan servicing. The hear-ing exposed troubling practices by the Department and loan servicers. After bringing these issues to light, Congress included new reforms in the Department of Education Appropriations Act, 2020, to ensure borrowers are getting the help they need. The Com-mittee is reviewing the Department's efforts to implement reforms as it considers the fiscal year 2021 budget request. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $40,000,000 for administrative expenses to support changes to the student aid programs to assist students and borrowers in response to COVID- 19. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul Federal Student Aid Feedback System and Ombudsman Group. \u2014 The Federal Student Aid Feedback System may be used by the public to submit feedback, report an issue or complaint, send a sug-gestion, provide information about a suspicious activity or an al-leged scam, dispute a resolution, or give feedback about the Fed-eral financial aid experience. The Ombudsman Group at the De-partment is a neutral, informal, and confidential resource to help resolve disputes about Federal student aid. Unfortunately, many borrowers do not know that the Department provides these serv-ices. The Committee directs the Department and student loan servicers to inform all consumers who express concern with their student aid experience of the services offered by the Federal Stu-dent Aid Feedback System and the Federal Student Aid Ombuds-man Group. The Committee directs the Department to prominently display links to the Federal Student Aid Feedback System and the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman Group at the top of https:// studentaid.gov/, the Department of Education's home page and any customer facing Federal Student Aid website. Within 120 days of enactment of this Act, the Committee directs the Department to update the Committees on Appropriations on these efforts to im-prove knowledge of the Federal Student Aid Feedback System and the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman Group. TEACH Grant Program. \u2014The TEACH Grant Program provides grants of $4,000 per year (for up to 4 years) to undergraduate and graduate students who are preparing for a career in teaching and who commit to teaching a high-need subject in a high-poverty ele-mentary or secondary school for four years. This grant is converted to a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan if a teacher does not fulfill their commitment. In 2015, GAO found 2,252 students had their grants incorrectly converted to loans. The Department's own subsequent investigation found that nearly 11,000 TEACH Grant recipients had their grants incorrectly turned into loans. The Committee directs the Department to include in its fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification an update on the specific ac-countability measures that have been put in place since the De-partment's investigation to ensure TEACH grants are not mistak-enly converted to loans. Deferment for Borrowers Receiving Cancer Treatment. \u2014The Com- mittee remains committed to individuals undergoing cancer treat-ment to defer their Federal student loans as outlined in Sec. 309 of P.L. 115-245. State and Nonprofit Subcontracting. \u2014The Committee believes that State and nonprofit organizations can assist Federal student loan servicers in providing important services to struggling bor-rowers who need access to more specialized support services throughout their postsecondary education to help them understand their financial decisions and act as advocates to help struggling borrowers understand the student loan repayment process and op-tions that may be available to them to help mitigate delinquencies and defaults. The Committee urges the Department to explore in-centives for Federal student loan servicers to subcontract with qualified State and nonprofit organizations as well as small busi-nesses. Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools. \u2014Ac- crediting agencies provide an important role in guarding access to VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, Federal student aid and ensuring that students receive a quality education. However, ACICS has a history of certifying predatory for-profit institutions, and an extensive review conducted in 2018 by Department staff showed that ACICS failed to meet 57 of 93 federal standards. In addition, ACICS is no longer recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation, and recent report-ing shows that ACICS accredited an institution without any staff, students, or alumni. In House Report 116-62, the Committee di-rected the Secretary to certify in a report that ACICS dem-onstrated compliance with all 57 of those standards before choosing to recognize ACICS. The Committee is deeply troubled that the De-partment has yet to produce this report and that ACICS is still rec-ognized by the Secretary of Education. Next Generation Servicing Environment. \u2014In 2017, the Depart- ment initiated the Next Generation Processing and Servicing Envi-ronment (Next Gen). Since that time, Congress has provided bil-lions of dollars in taxpayer funding for Student Aid Administration activities, including the development and implementation of Next Gen. However, the Committee is deeply troubled by FSA's lack of transparency regarding associated costs and use of funds for Next Gen. The explanatory statement accompanying the Department of Education Appropriations Act, 2020, required FSA ''to provide a de-tailed strategic plan for Next Gen to the Committees within 180 days of enactment of this Act, accounting for the cost of all activi-ties associated with the full implementation of Next Gen, including transition costs.'' No such plan has been provided to date. More-over, the Committee notes that implementation of Next Gen has been riddled with bid protests and recompetes. In addition, while the Department has stated that Next Gen would bring about cost savings in the delivery and operation of student loan servicing, it is not clear whether any savings have been produced. Therefore, the recommendation includes new bill language requiring FSA to produce the overdue strategic plan. The recommendation also in-cludes new bill language requiring FSA to submit a detailed spend plan of anticipated uses, including contracts awarded, change re-quests, bonuses paid to staff, reorganization costs, and any other activity supported by this appropriation. In an effort to further promote transparency concerning Next Gen, the Committee directs FSA to provide to the Committees on Appropriations, the House Committee on Education and Labor, and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, within 45 days of enactment of this Act, all contracts pertaining to Next Gen, including Digital and Customer Care, Enhanced Proc-essing Solution, and Business Process Operations. FSA is further directed to provide a detailed description of the accountability pro-visions pertaining to each contract within 45 days of enactment of this Act, as well. GAO Audit. \u2014The Committee is concerned that in 2019 a GAO report (GAO-19-471) identified the Department's information tech-nology systems as one of the 10 most critical legacy systems in need of modernization. The Department stated that it intends to modernize its systems as part of its Next Gen initiative. This ini-tiative would modernize FSA's technical and operational architec-ture and improve the customer experience. However, the Depart-ment has yet to develop a plan for the modernization of its legacy VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, systems. As a result, the Committee directs GAO to complete an in-depth review and audit of the FSA Office's transition to the Next Gen initiative including cost and schedule estimates; requirements development/management; stakeholder involvement; plans for the disposition of the legacy systems; and, measures to track the suc-cess of the modernization. HIGHER EDUCATION Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $2,475,792,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 1,788,634,000 ............................................................. 2,556,815,000 Change from ......................................................... +81,023,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +768,181,000 The CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $30,750,000,000 for the Education Stabilization Fund (ESF) to prevent, prepare for, and re-spond to the coronavirus, domestically or internationally. The ESF included $13,952,505,000 in funding for higher education emer-gency relief and $3,000,000,000 in funding to governors for elemen-tary, secondary, and postsecondary emergency relief. Strengthening Institutions The Committee recommends $114,244,000 for the Part A, Strengthening Institutions program, which is $6,390,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget re-quest proposes to eliminate this program. Funding supports com-petitive grants for general operating subsidies to institutions with below average educational and general expenditures per student and significant percentages of low-income students. Funds may be used for faculty and academic program development, management, joint use of libraries and laboratories, acquisition of equipment, and student services. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $148,591,000 for the Strengthening Institutions program to directly support students and institutions addressing effects of COVID-19. Homelessness in Community College Students. \u2014Within 180 days of enactment of this Act, the Committee requests the Department to issue a report on challenges faced by community college stu-dents. This includes housing and food insecurity. This report should focus on Minority Serving Institutions and institutions in low income census areas. Developing Hispanic-Serving Institutions The Committee recommends $155,081,000 for the Developing Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) program, which is $12,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request does not include funding for this program and pro-poses to consolidate it and the following programs into a single grant program for Minority Serving Institutions (MSI): (1) Strengthening Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian Serving Institu-tions, (2) Strengthening Predominantly Black Institutions, (3) Strengthening Asian American and Native American Pacific Is-lander Serving Institutions, (4) Strengthening Native American Serving Nontribal Institutions, and (6) Promoting Postbaccalaureate Opportunities for Hispanic Americans. The Com- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, rejects this budget proposal and does not include funds for such purpose. The Developing HSIs program provides operating subsidies to schools that serve at least 25 percent Hispanic students. Funds may be used for faculty and academic program development, man-agement, joint use of libraries and laboratories, acquisition of equipment, and student services. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $197,123,000 for the Developing HSIs program to directly support students and institutions addressing effects of COVID-19. K-12 and Hispanic-Serving Institutions Diversity Pipeline Pro- grams in the Arts.\u2014 Latinos/Hispanics continue to be the largest ethnic minority in the U.S. and the second fastest growing ethnic minority group. Nevertheless, Latinos/Hispanics continue to be under-represented and misrepresented in the entertainment indus-try. The Committee supports efforts to increase Latino/Hispanic students' exposure and training to careers in the arts in K-12 pub-lic education, and through postsecondary education at HSIs. The Committee directs the Department to work with HSIs and provide technical assistance to support comprehensive pipeline programs in the arts in partnership with school districts that enroll a majority, minority student population. The Committee requests periodic up-dates on any progress in developing such programs, including in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification. Graduation Rates. \u2014The Committee notes that HSIs provide many benefits and educational opportunities to their students. However, the Committee is concerned that students at HSIs may be graduating at lower rates than students at non-HSIs. Therefore, the Committee directs the Department to provide an update in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification on graduation rates, retention rates, and persistence rates for students at HSIs, including a strategy on how to improve overall postsecondary com-pletion at HSIs. Promoting Postbaccalaureate Opportunities for Americans The Committee recommends $13,599,000 for the Promoting Postbaccalaureate Opportunities for Hispanic Americans program, which is $761,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request does not include funding for this program and proposes to consolidate it into a single MSI grant program, which the Committee does not support. This program pro-vides expanded postbaccalaureate educational opportunities for the academic attainment of Hispanic and low-income students. In addi-tion, it expands academic offerings and enhances program quality at IHEs educating the majority of Hispanic college students. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $17,687,000 for the Promoting Postbaccalaureate Opportunities for Hispanic Americans program to directly support students and institutions addressing effects of COVID-19. Strengthening Historically Black Colleges and Universities The Committee recommends $344,034,000 for Strengthening His- torically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), which is $19,242,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This program provides operating VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, to accredited HBCUs that were established prior to 1964, with the principal mission of educating Black Americans. Funds are distributed through a formula grant based on the enrollment of Pell Grant recipients, number of graduates, and the number of graduates entering graduate or professional schools in which Black students are underrepresented. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $447,466,000 for the Strengthening HBCUs program to directly support students and institutions addressing effects of COVID-19. Strengthening Historically Black Graduate Institutions The Committee recommends $88,971,000 for the Strengthening Historically Black Graduate Institutions (HBGIs) program, which is $4,976,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The program provides five-year grants to 18 postsecondary institutions that are specified in section 326(e)(1) of the HEA. Institutions may use funds to build endow-ments, provide scholarships and fellowships, and to assist students with the enrollment and completion of postbaccalaureate and pro-fessional degrees. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $115,720,000 for the Strengthening HBGIs program to directly sup-port students and institutions addressing effects of COVID-19. Strengthening Predominantly Black Institutions The Committee recommends $13,979,000 for the Strengthening Predominantly Black Institutions (PBIs) program, which is $782,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request does not include funding for this program and proposes to consolidate it into a single MSI grant program, which the Committee does not support. This program provides grants to PBIs to increase their capacity to serve the academic needs of students. The bill includes new bill language allowing certain PBIs to be eligible for additional grants. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $18,182,000 for the Strengthening PBIs program to directly support students and institutions addressing effects of COVID-19. Strengthening Asian American and Native American Pacific-Is- lander-Serving Institutions The Committee recommends $4,707,000 for the Strengthening Asian American and Native American Pacific-Islander-Serving In-stitutions program, which is $263,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request does not include funding for this program and proposes to consolidate it into a single MSI grant program, which the Committee does not sup-port. This program provides grants to undergraduate institutions that have an undergraduate student enrollment of at least 10 per-cent Asian American or Native American Pacific Islander. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $6,123,000 for the Strengthening Asian American and Native American Pa-cific-Islander-Serving Institutions program to directly support stu-dents and institutions addressing the effects of COVID-19. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, Native Hawaiian-Serving Institu- tions The Committee recommends $19,405,000 for the Strengthening Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions program, which is $1,085,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request does not include funding for this program and proposes to consolidate it into a single MSI grant program, which the Committee does not support. Through the Strengthening Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian-Serving Institu-tions program, the Department provides grants to assist IHEs in serving Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian students. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $6,123,000 for the Strengthening Alaska Native and Hawaiian-Serving Institu-tions program to directly support students and institutions ad-dressing effects of COVID-19. Strengthening Native American Serving Non-Tribal Institutions The Committee recommends $4,707,000 for the Native American Serving Non-Tribal Institutions program, which is $263,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request does not include funding for this program and proposes to consolidate it into a single MSI grant program, which the Com-mittee does not support. This program makes grants to IHEs at which enrollment is at least 10 percent Native American students and that are not Tribally Controlled Colleges or Universities. The Committee urges the Secretary to support the preparation and development of aspiring rural and Indigenous PreK-12 teach-ers and leaders to enable the implementation of effective cultural and heritage language programs for PreK-12 students. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $6,123,000 for the Strengthening Native American Serving Non-Tribal Institu-tions program to directly support students and institutions ad-dressing effects of COVID-19. Strengthening Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities The Committee recommends $38,804,000 for the Strengthening Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities (TCCUs) program, which is $2,171,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This program makes grants to TCCUs to increase their capacity to serve the academic needs of students. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $148,591,000 for the Strengthening TCCUs program to directly support students and institutions addressing effects of COVID-19. Strengthening HBCU Masters Program The Committee recommends $10,546,000 for the Strengthening HBCU Masters Programs, which is $590,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This program provides grants to specified colleges and universities making a substantial contribution to graduate education opportuni-ties at the Master's level in mathematics, engineering, the physical or natural sciences, computer science, information technology, nursing, allied health, or other scientific disciplines. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, Act (P.L. 116-136) included $13,716,000 for the Strengthening HBCU Masters Program to directly support students and institutions addressing the effects of COVID-19. International Education and Foreign Language Studies Domestic Programs. \u2014The Committee recommends $70,762,000 for the Domestic Programs of the International Education and For-eign Languages Studies program, which is $2,659,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget re-quest proposes to eliminate this program. Authorized by Title VI of the HEA, these programs include National resource centers, for-eign language and area studies fellowships, undergraduate inter-national studies and foreign language programs, international re-search and studies projects, business and international education projects, international business education centers, language re-source centers, American overseas research centers, and techno-logical innovation and cooperation for foreign information access. Overseas Programs. \u2014The Committee recommends $9,561,000 for the Overseas Programs, which is $1,500,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request pro-poses to eliminate this program. Funding for these programs sup-port group projects, faculty research, special bilateral research, and doctoral dissertation research conducted abroad. Model Comprehensive Transition and Postsecondary Programs for Students with Intellectual Disabilities The Committee recommends $12,300,000 for the Model Com- prehensive Transition and Postsecondary Programs for Students with Intellectual Disabilities (TPSID) program, which is $500,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. TPSID supports grants to create model tran-sition programs into postsecondary education for students with in-tellectual disabilities. Minority Science and Engineering Improvement The Committee recommends $13,384,000 for the Minority Science and Engineering Improvement Program, which is $749,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $136,616,000 below the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This program awards grants to improve mathematics, science, and engineering programs at institutions serving primarily minority students and to increase the number of minority students who pursue advanced degrees and careers in those fields. Tribally Controlled Postsecondary Career and Technical Institu- tions The Committee recommends $10,592,000 for this program, which is $592,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The Tribally Controlled Postsec-ondary Career and Technical Institutionsprogram awards competi-tive grants to Tribally controlled postsecondary career and tech-nical institutions to provide career and technical education to Na-tive American students. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul TRIO Programs The Committee recommends $1,100,000,000 for TRIO programs, which is $10,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $150,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The TRIO programs provide a variety of outreach and support services to encourage low-income, first-generation college students and indi-viduals with disabilities to enter and complete college. Discre-tionary grants of up to four or five years are awarded competitively to IHEs and other nonprofit organizations. At least two thirds of the eligible participants in TRIO must be low-income, first-genera-tion college students. The Committee rejects the fiscal year 2021 budget proposal to move the TRIO programs from competitive grant programs to a single State formula program. Further, the Committee directs the Department to allocate any grant funding not needed for non-com-petitive continuation awards or for programs up for competition in fiscal year 2021 to provide inflationary increases for current grant-ees and to increase the number and size of new awards in the Tal-ent Search and Educational Opportunity Centers grant competi-tions. The Department is also directed to ensure that the notices inviting applications for new awards for the Talent Search and Educational Opportunity Centers grant competitions no later than October 15, 2020 for Talent Search and no later than November 15, 2020 for Educational Opportunity Centers. The Department is fur-ther directed to take steps necessary to award funding as early as possible, but no later than June 30, 2021. Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Pro- grams The Committee recommends $370,000,000 for Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP), which is $5,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request proposes no funds for this program and to consolidate it into a new State formula-based TRIO program. The Committee rejects this proposal. GEAR UP provides grants to States and partnerships of low-income middle and high schools, IHEs, and community organizations to target en-tire grades of students and give them the skills, encouragement, and scholarships to pursue successfully postsecondary education. The Committee continues bill language allowing the Department to maintain the GEAR UP evaluation set-aside at 1.5 percent to work with the GEAR UP community and grantees to standardize data collection, including through the use of third-party data sys-tems. Furthermore, the Committee directs the Department to announce Notices Inviting Applications for New Awards for State Grants and Partnership Grants in the Federal Register. In such notice for State grants, the Committee directs the Department to uphold the long-standing guidance that States may only administer one active State GEAR UP grant at a time. The Secretary is directed to pro-vide written guidance in the Federal Register notifying applicants that only States without an active State GEAR UP grant, or States that have an active State GEAR UP grant that is scheduled to end prior to October 1, 2021, will be eligible to receive a new State GEAR UP award funded in whole or in part by this appropriation. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, The Secretary is further directed to ensure that no request from a State Grant applicant to receive an exception to the GEAR UP scholarship (as described in section 404E(b)(2) of the HEA) shall be denied on the basis of 34 CFR 694.14(c)(3). Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need The Committee recommends $24,047,000 for the Graduate As- sistance in Areas of National Need (GAANN) program, which is $1,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request proposes to eliminate this program. GAANN provides fellowships through grants to degree granting postsecondary institutions, for students of high financial need studying in areas of national need. The Department consults with appropriate agencies and organizations to designate the fields of study ''in areas of national need.'' GAANN offers innovative grad-uate education programs, with associated fellowship opportunities, at the intersection of humanities, arts, STEM, and health associ-ated fields in order to prepare our national graduate students for increasingly interdisciplinary global challenges. Recent examples include computer and informational sciences, engineering, nursing, and physics. Since 2012, an academic area related to health professions has only been designated once. It is estimated that more than 18 per-cent of the U.S. adult population has suffered from any mental ill-ness. Mental health is clearly an area of national need. The Com-mittee directs the Secretary to consider the inclusion of academic areas that fall under the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) 51.15 Mental Health Services on the next grant competition. Teacher Quality Partnership Grants The Committee recommends $52,092,000 for the Teacher Quality Partnerships (TQP) program, which is $2,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request proposes to eliminate this program. The TQP program helps im-prove the quality of teachers working in high-need schools and early childhood education programs by creating model teacher preparation and residency programs. The Committee recognizes the importance of State teaching fel- lowship programs and encourages the Department to continue to work with eligible State teaching fellowship programs that wish to apply for the TQP program. The Committee recognizes the needs of the nation's growing English learner (EL) student population, including a robust teacher workforce equipped with the skills to teach them. The Committee is concerned by the shortage of EL teachers in the majority of States, as well the academic achievement gap between ELs and their native English-speaking peers. Therefore, the Committee rec-ommends the Secretary support the development and strength-ening of high-quality teacher preparation programs that enable graduates to meet licensure or certification requirements to teach ELs. Child Care Access Means Parents in School The Committee recommends $55,000,000 for the Child Care Ac- cess Means Parents in School program, which is $2,000,000 more VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $39,866,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This program makes competitive grants to colleges and universities to support or establish a cam-pus-based childcare program primarily serving the needs of low-in-come students enrolled at the institution. The Committee is concerned with the disproportionate levels of support that colleges and universities provide to students who are parents. The Committee directs the Secretary to provide a report on: (1) the percentage of students who are parents in colleges and universities, disaggregated by race, socioeconomic status, and age; (2) services institutions provide for student parents; (3) outreach methods to ensure students are informed of available resources; (4) the availability of on-campus and subsidized childcare; and (5) the availability of lactation rooms for nursing mothers. The Committee requests this report no later than one year after enactment of this Act. Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education The Committee recommendation includes $31,000,000 for the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education, which is $6,500,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget proposes to eliminate this program. Centers of Excellence for Veteran Student Success Program. \u2014 The Committee includes $7,000,000 to support existing and new grant-ees for the Centers of Excellence for Veterans Student Success Pro-gram, as authorized by section 873 of the HEA. Funding provided in fiscal year 2020 supported the first competition for this program since fiscal year 2015. The fiscal year 2021 budget request does not include funding for this program. Over one million veterans attend college every year and often need assistance receiving their benefits or transitioning to student life. Veteran Student Centers provide a one-stop-shop for academic support, networking opportunities, peer mentorship, financial as-sistance, counseling, and career services. The Department should ensure that this program continues to support comprehensive services including veteran benefits assist-ance, tutoring, counseling, and housing. The Committee directs the Department to brief the Committees on Appropriations no later than 90 days after enactment of this Act on its plan to continue to carry out this program, as well as a plan for evaluation and ac-countability, and to notify the Committees no later than 15 days in advance of making any new grant award or changes to the pro-grams. Center of Educational Excellence. \u2014The Committee notes that Black teachers make up about seven percent of the nation's public school teaching force, while the Black student population is about 14 percent. A comprehensive report published by the Department in 2016 on the State of Racial Diversity in the Educator Workforce notes the significant contributions HBCUs make in the production of the Nation's educators. The report also notes that Black men make up less than two percent of teachers. The Committee rec-ommendation includes $2,000,000 to support a model center of edu-cational excellence at an undergraduate HBCU with a demon-strable record in the production of Black teachers. The Committee VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, directs the Department to provide a briefing within 90 days of en- actment of this Act on its plans to establish this center. Basic Needs Grants. \u2014The Committee recognizes that many col- lege and graduate students are unable to achieve academic success because they cannot afford to meet their basic needs, such as hous-ing, food, transportation, and access to physical and mental health services. The Committee includes $5,000,000 for competitive grants to at least four institutions of higher education, as defined by sec-tion 101 of the HEA, to support programs that address the basic needs of students and report on best practices. In order to qualify, grantees must agree to use funds to carry out or expand at least two of the following activities to fund basic needs programs that support temporary housing, secure sleeping arrangements, provide free or subsidized food, access to on-campus childcare, and/or other basic needs to eligible students; construct housing on community college campuses; conduct outreach to students to encourage par-ticipation in basic needs programs and services; help eligible stu-dents apply for and enroll in local, State, and Federal public assist-ance programs; or coordinate and collaborate with government and/ or community-based organizations. At least 25 percent of grants must go to community colleges. Grant priority will go to institu-tions with 25 percent or higher Pell enrollment, HBCUs, HSIs, and other MSIs that are located in areas with high median house prices compared to income and high concentrations of Supplemental Nu-trition Assistance Program and/or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families benefit recipients. Transitioning Gang-Involved Youth to Higher Education. \u2014The Committee directs the Department to work in conjunction with the Department of Labor to allocate no less than $1,000,000 to provide a funding opportunity for organizations that work directly with gang involved youth to help such youth pursue higher education opportunities. Modeling and Simulation Programs. \u2014The Committee includes $7,000,000 for Modeling and Simulation Programs as authorized under section 891 of the HEA. Modeling and simulation technology has numerous applications for Federal and State governments and their partners in the defense, education, gaming, shipbuilding, and workforce training sectors, allowing them to generate data to help make decisions or predictions about their systems. National Center for Information and Technical Support for Post- secondary Students with Disabilities. \u2014The Committee includes $2,000,000 for the operation of the National Center for Information and Technical Support for Postsecondary Students with Disabilities as authorized under section 777(a) of the HEA. Open Textbook Pilot. \u2014The agreement includes $7,000,000 to con- tinue the Open Textbook Pilot and fund a new grant competition in fiscal year 2021. The Department shall issue a notice inviting applications consistent with notice and comment procedures and allow for a 60-day application period. This funding should support a significant number of grant awards to IHEs as defined by 20 U.S.C. 1001, a group of IHEs, or State higher education agencies that lead the activities of (and serve as fiscal agent for) a consor-tium. Funding should be used to create new open textbooks and ex-pand the use of open textbooks in courses that are part of a degree granting program, and particularly those with high enrollments. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul Allowable uses of funds should include professional development for faculty and staff, including relating to the search for and review of open textbooks; the creation or adaptation of open textbooks; de-velopment or improvement of tools and informational resources that support the use of open textbooks, including accessible instruc-tional materials for students with disabilities; and research evalu-ating the efficacy of the use of open textbooks for achieving savings for students and the impact on instruction and student learning outcomes. The Secretary shall require that any open textbooks cre-ated with these funds shall be released to the public under a non- exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, and irrevocable license to exer-cise any of the rights under copyright conditioned only on the re-quirement that attribution be given as directed by the copyright owner. Further, any tools, technologies, or other resources that are created, developed, or improved wholly or in part with these funds for use with any open textbook must be similarly licensed. Any eli-gible entity receiving a grant through the Open Textbooks Pilot, upon completion of the supported project, shall report to the Sec-retary regarding the effectiveness of the project in expanding the use of open textbooks and in achieving savings for students; the impact of the project on expanding the use of open textbooks at IHEs outside of the institution receiving the grant; open textbooks created or adapted under the grant, including instructions on where the public can access each open textbook; the impact of the project on instruction and student learning outcomes; and all project costs, including the value of any volunteer labor and insti-tutional capital used for the project. The Secretary shall make such reports publicly available. Film Programs at Institutions of Higher Education. \u2014 Within 180 days of enactment of this Act, the Committee directs the Depart-ment to provide a report on student diversity in film programs at IHEs and film schools. The report should include the following in-formation: the number of film schools and institutions that receive any Federal funds and grants administered by the Department of Education; where data are available, the diversity of film school ap-plicants; the diversity of accepted film students; and the diversity of students enrolled in their programs. This data should be disaggregated by race, ethnicity, and gender where applicable and where data are available. The report should also include an exam-ination of recruitment efforts, including the results of these efforts, to help ensure a diverse class of accepted film school students. Skills training program. \u2014The Committee strongly urges the De- partment to create a pilot program that enhances economic oppor-tunities in digital literacy by supporting institutions of higher edu-cation in developing and providing 21st-century college programs and opportunities that increases students' employability through knowledge and skill enhancements. HOWARD UNIVERSITY Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $240,018,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 240,018,000 ............................................................. 254,018,000 Change from +14,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +14,000,000 VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Howard University is a leading research university located in the District of Columbia and provides undergraduate liberal arts, grad-uate and professional instruction to students. Within the amount provided, the Committee recommends $37,325,000 for the Howard University Hospital, which is $10,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The hospital serves as a major acute and ambulatory care center for the District of Columbia, and functions as a teaching facility. To continue this vital function, the Committee notes the need to modernize the hospital's facilities and will continue to evaluate the needs of this multi-year initiative. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $13,000,000 for Howard University to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus, including support for students. COLLEGE HOUSING AND ACADEMIC FACILITIES LOANS PROGRAM Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $435,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 435,000 Committee Recommendation ............................................................. 435,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... - - - Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - Previously, these programs helped to ensure that postsecondary institutions were able to make necessary capital improvements to maintain and increase their ability to provide a high-quality edu-cation. Since 1994, no new loans have been made, and the Depart-ment's role has been to manage the outstanding loans. HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY CAPITAL FINANCING PROGRAM ACCOUNT Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $46,484,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 40,484,000 ............................................................. 48,484,000 Change from ......................................................... +2,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +8,000,000 The Committee recommends $48,484,000 for the HBCU Capital Financing program, which is $2,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $8,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budg-et request. This program is authorized under part D of Title III of the HEA and makes capital available for repair and renovation of facilities at HBCUs. In exceptional circumstances, capital provided under the program can be used for construction or acquisition of fa-cilities. Within the total provided for this program, the Committee rec- ommendation includes $334,000 for the administrative expenses to carry out the program and $22,150,000 for loan subsidy costs, which will be sufficient to guarantee up to $278,266,000 in new loans in fiscal year 2021, an increase of $58,266,000 in new loan volume over the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The Committee recommendation also includes $16,000,000 to continue loan deferments initially requested in fiscal year 2018 for private HBCUs and continues bill language to provide loan deferments for public HBCUs. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 EDUCATION SCIENCES Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $623,462,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 565,440,000 ............................................................. 630,462,000 Change from ......................................................... +7,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +65,022,000 The Committee recommends $630,462,000 for the Institute of Education Sciences (IES), $7,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $65,022,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The Committee notes that the IES study regarding whether Pell grant eligibility and shorter-term programs improves access to job training was due to be released September 2019. The Committee directs IES to publish the study within 30 days of enactment of this Act. Research, Development, and Dissemination The Committee recommends $197,877,000 for Research, Develop- ment, and Dissemination, which is $2,000,000 more that the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This account supports research, development, and national dissemi-nation activities that are aimed at expanding fundamental knowl-edge of education and promoting the use of research and develop-ment findings in the design of efforts to improve education. Statistics The Committee recommends $111,500,000 for the activities of the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which is $1,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $2,000,000 below the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Statistics ac-tivities are authorized under Title I of the Education Sciences Re-form Act of 2002. NCES collects, analyzes, and reports statistics on all levels of education in the U.S. Activities are carried out directly and through grants and contracts and include projections of enroll-ments, teacher supply and demand, and educational expenditures. NCES also provides technical assistance to State and local edu-cational agencies and postsecondary institutions. The Committee recommends that NCES collect and publish data for Puerto Rico in the same manner it collects and publishes data for States. Regional Educational Laboratories The Committee recommends $57,022,000 for Regional Edu- cational Laboratories (RELs), which is $1,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request proposes to eliminate this program. This program supports a net-work of 10 laboratories that promote the use and development of knowledge and evidence to increase student learning and further school improvement efforts. The Committee notes the critical role RELs play in helping to translate education research to policymakers and practitioners, which assists SEAs and LEAs in implementing ESSA and pro-viding a high-quality education for more children. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, in Special Education The Committee recommends $58,500,000 for Research in Special Education, which is $2,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 en-acted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This program supports competitive awards to produce and advance the use of knowledge to improve services and results for children with disabil-ities. The program focuses on producing new knowledge, inte-grating research and practice, and improving the use of knowledge. Special Education Studies and Evaluations The Committee recommends $11,318,000 for Special Education Studies and Evaluations, which is $500,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This program awards competitive grants, contracts and cooperative agreements to assess the implementation of the IDEA and the ef-fectiveness of State and local efforts to provide special education and early intervention programs and services to infants, toddlers, and children with disabilities. Statewide Data Systems The Committee recommends $33,500,000 for Statewide Data Sys- tems, which is $500,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget proposes to eliminate this pro-gram. Competitive grants under this authority are made to SEAs to help them manage, analyze, disaggregate and use student data consistent with the ESEA. Assessment The Committee recommends $160,745,000 for Assessment, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $28,000,000 below the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This amount includes $7,745,000 for the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB), which is the same as both the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the only nationally representative and continuing survey of educational ability and achievement of students in the U.S. The primary goal of the assessment is to determine and report the status and trends of the knowledge and skills of students, subject by subject. Subject areas assessed in the past have included reading, writing, mathe-matics, science, history, citizenship, literature, art, and music. The NAEP is operated by contractors through competitive awards made by the NCES. The NAGB formulates the policy guidelines for the program. DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $623,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 646,742,000 ............................................................. 626,000,000 Change from ......................................................... +3,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a520,742,000 These activities are authorized by the Department of Education Organization Act (P.L. 96-88) and include costs associated with the management and operation of the Department as well as separate VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, costs associated with the Office for Civil Rights and the Office of Inspector General. Program Administration The Committee recommends $430,000,000 for Program Adminis- tration, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $18,723,000 below the fiscal year 2021 budget request. These funds support the staff and other costs of administering programs and ac-tivities at the Department. Items include personnel compensation, health, retirement, and other benefits as well as travel, rent, tele-phones, utilities, postage fees, data processing, printing, equip-ment, supplies, technology training, consultants, and other contrac-tual services. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $8,000,000 for Program Administration to help implement and administer grant programs supporting students and schools responding to COVID-19. Communication with the Committee .\u2014There are concerns about the breakdown of the normal flow of information from some areas of the Department to the Committee. The Committee expects the Department to correct these shortcomings. If no improvement is made, the Committee will evaluate the resources spent on the of-fices and staff involved in the unacceptable delays regarding the transmission of information to the Committee and whether the re-sources are better allocated to other areas of the bill. Advertising Contracts .\u2014The Committee understands that, as the largest advertiser in the U.S., the Federal Government should work to ensure fair access to its advertising contracts for small dis-advantaged businesses and businesses owned by minorities and women. The Committee directs the Department to include the fol-lowing information in its fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification: Expenditures for fiscal year 2020 and expected ex-penditures for fiscal years 2021 and 2022, respectively, for (1) all contracts for advertising services; and (2) contracts for the adver-tising services of (I) socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns (as defined in section 8(a)(4) of the Small Busi-ness Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)(4)); and (II) women- and minority-owned businesses. Open Data Reporting .\u2014The Committee notes that Congress has made a significant investment in our workforce development, post-secondary, and career and technical education systems. As a result of this investment, the number of credentials in the U.S. continues to rise. However, the Committee is aware that many workers and students may face challenges in navigating an intricate network of diplomas, licenses, certifications, and badges. Therefore, the rec-ommendation includes new bill language requiring the Department to publicly disclose information on postsecondary credentials and competencies in an open-source format. The Committee believes that this requirement will lead to the development of useful com-parison tools and other resources that will improve the delivery of workforce development and postsecondary education programs, as well as enable workers and students to make more informed choices in their educational and job-training journeys. The Com-mittee directs the Department to ensure that such information is also provided in a consumer-tested and user-friendly manner to en- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul sure that workers and students are able to utilize this information about potential credentials effectively. Investments in Impoverished Areas .\u2014The Committee supports targeted investments in impoverished areas, particularly in per-sistent poverty counties and in other high poverty census tracts. To understand how programs funded through the Department are serving these particular areas, the Committee directs the Depart-ment to submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations on the percentage of funds allocated by all competitive grant programs and other anti-poverty programs in fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020 and estimates for fiscal year 2021 to serve individuals living in persistent poverty counties, as defined as a county that has had 20 percent or more of its population living in poverty over the past 30 years, as measured by the 1990 and 2000 decennial censuses and the most recent Small Area Income and Poverty estimates, or any territory or possession of the United States, and high-poverty areas, as defined as any census tract with a poverty rate of at least 20 percent as measured by the 2014-2018 5-year data series avail-able from the American Community Survey of the Census Bureau. The Department shall report this information to the Committees within 90 days of such data being available and provide a briefing to the Committees not later than 180 days of enactment of this Act on how the Department is carrying out this directive. In the case of any program for which at least 10 percent of the funds allocated in fiscal year 2020 were not allocated to persistent poverty counties or for which the percentage allocated to high-poverty areas in fiscal year 2020 was less than the average percentage of Federal assist-ance allocated to high-poverty areas awarded under the program in fiscal years 2017, 2018, and 2019, such report and briefing shall ex-plain why such a benchmark is unable to be met. Spatial Computing .\u2014According to the Bureau of Labor and Sta- tistics (BLS), the technology sector is the fastest growing market within the U.S. However, many of these jobs are being outsourced internationally. Not only does this present a threat to this Nation's economy, it also poses a threat to our national security. The Com-mittee supports technological innovation, including spatial com-puting, and encourages the Department, within 180 days of enact-ment of the Act, to conduct and provide a feasibility report to the Committee on the establishment of a Center of Excellence designa-tion for Spatial Computing. This designation would assist institu-tions of higher education in their efforts to teach and train stu-dents within the field of spatial computing. The Department should include a timeline, cost and recommendations for the creation of this Center of Excellence designation. The Committee encourages the Department to work with the Departments of Labor and Com-merce for their input and recommendations. Vaping .\u2014The Committee directs the Department to coordinate with the CDC to ensure that evidence-based strategies are used to more robustly respond to the public health epidemic caused by the dramatic increase in youth use of e-cigarettes, including school- based interventions. According to the CDC, vaping among high school students soared from 1.5 percent to 27.5 percent between 2011 and 2019. Among middle school students, vaping skyrocketed from 0.6 percent to 10.5 percent. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, Rico Department of Education Subgrantee Oversight .\u2014 The Committee understands that the Department required the Puerto Rico Department of Education (PRDE) to contract with a third-party fiduciary agent to perform financial management duties for all Department grants awarded to PRDE. The Committee recog-nizes the need for proper oversight of disbursement of Federal funds and acknowledges that increased oversight should not have a negative impact on students in Puerto Rico, particularly K-12 students. Impact of Natural Disasters .\u2014To help better inform Congress, the Executive Branch, and communities affected by natural disas-ters, the Committee directs the Department complete a study on the impact of recent natural disasters on the educational attain-ment and economic outcomes of individuals and families over time. Such a study could also explore the effects that extreme weather events have on SEL and other social determinants of health like physical and mental health, nutrition, and sense of community. The Committee directs the Department to brief the Committees on Appropriations on its plans for this study within 180 days of enact-ment of this Act. Public Health Emergencies .\u2014In the fiscal year 2022 Congres- sional Budget Justification, the Committee encourages the Depart-ment to assess the effectiveness of various school technological interventions used for school closures due to public health emer-gencies. This analysis could examine characteristics of different technological interventions, including the lending of laptops, tab-lets, and mobile hotspots, and the cost of providing these interven-tions at the SEA and LEA level. Lead Testing and Remediation .\u2014The Committee strongly agrees with recommendations from a 2018 GAO report, Lead Testing of School Drinking Water Would Benefit from Improved Federal Guidance, that the Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Sec-ondary Education should collaborate with the Environmental Pro-tection Agency (EPA) to disseminate guidance related to lead test-ing and remediation in schools. The Committee is aware that EPA has made available updated guidance and web-based toolkits for lead testing and remediation in schools. The Committee is also aware that EPA is soliciting applications from education officials to provide grant funds to assist States and local education agencies with testing and remediation efforts. The Committee appreciates the technical assistance provided by the Department to school dis-tricts in response to language included in House Report 116-62. The Committee directs the Department to continue coordinating with EPA in disseminating this new guidance and resources, as-sisting school systems seeking to remediate lead contamination in working with EPA, and sharing best practices among States and local school systems. The Committee expects the Department to re-port on the Department's ongoing efforts on these issues in the fis-cal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification. Information and Communication Technology .\u2014The Committee directs the Office of Educational Technology, in consultation with the Institute of Education Sciences and the National Academies of Science, to conduct a study and prepare a report and submit to the Committee within one year of enactment of this Act on the use of information and communication technology (ICT) in K-12 class- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 The Office of Educational Technology will review the avail- able literature on the role ICT plays in K-12 classrooms, consider both positive and negative effects, and explore how ICT can most effectively be used to support students' learning. The Office of Edu-cational Technology will make recommendations on future direc-tions for research, policy, and practices to improve the educational outcomes for children and youth. Broadband Connectivity Gaps .\u2014While the CDC provides guid- ance to schools on continuing operations during a public health cri-sis, the equity concerns for students who live in households without access to broadband connectivity are unknown and may not be in-corporated to schools' continuity of operations plans. As such, the Secretary is encouraged to coordinate with the Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture and the Federal Com-munications Commission to study broadband connectivity gaps on the abilities of schools to implement alternative education plans for students completing distance learning assignments during ex-tended closings due to public health crises. The Secretary of Edu-cation is encouraged to develop a plan of action for addressing broadband connectivity inequities in the short term for the current public health crisis caused by COVID-19 as well as a plan for long- term strategies to lessen the impacts of these inequities for public health crises that may prompt school closures in the future. National Center for Education Statistics Staffing .\u2014The Com- mittee is deeply concerned about the ongoing staffing crisis at NCES. The shortage of statisticians threatens the administration and dissemination of data collections and surveys that provide an assessment of and insight in the nation's systems of education. Furthermore, these collections and surveys guide policy and fund-ing decisions made by Congress. The Committee directs the De-partment to submit to the Committee within 120 days of enactment of this Act a report outlining how the Department will increase staffing at NCES as well as an analysis of funding IES in an ap-propriations account outside of the Program Administration ac-count. Further, the Committee directs the Department to provide quarterly updates on its efforts to carry out the staffing plan. FTE and Attrition Report .\u2014The Committee directs the Depart- ment to provide the Committees on Appropriations a report, not later than 30 days after the conclusion of each quarter, detailing the number of full-time equivalent employees and attrition by prin-cipal office and appropriations account. Reporting Requirements .\u2014The Committee notes that the Depart- ment of Education has failed to meet all of its reporting obligations under House Report 116-62 and the explanatory statement accom-panying the Department of Education Appropriations Act, 2020. The Committee also notes that this failure occurred where the Of-fice of Legislation and Congressional Affairs served as the lead of-fice for the report. The Committee continues to direct the Depart-ment to issue these overdue reports immediately. Furthermore, the Committee directs the Office of Legislation and Congressional Af-fairs to submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations, with-in 30 days of enactment of this Act, providing the reason for the delay, all actions taken by the office to expedite the delivery of the reports and to provide a detailed account of how the office will im-prove its process for providing these reports in a timely manner. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, Research on Marihuana .\u2014Through scientific research, institutions of higher education advance our under-standing and knowledge of various aspects of our world. Moreover, when in the public interest, such institutions should be able to con-duct such research without fear of reprisal or loss of Federal fund-ing. This includes research on cannabis, a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act. As more States and localities move to legalize cannabis, many institutions of high-er education are expanding the knowledge-base on this controlled substance. As a result, the Committee notes that such research is in the public interest, and the recommendation includes new bill language prohibiting the Department from penalizing institutions of higher education that conduct scientific research on marihuana. Disclosure of Foreign Gifts and Contracts .\u2014The Committee re- minds colleges and universities receiving Federal funds that section 117 of the HEA requires institutions to disclose certain gifts from or contracts with foreign entities and that the Department makes such information publicly available on its website. The Committee directs the Department to work with institutions to improve the re-porting process. Disclosure requirements increase transparency and help protect our national security and academic integrity. Evidence-based Grants and Policy .\u2014The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification on implementation of the Foundations for Evidence-based Policy-making Act (P.L. 115-435) and implementation plans for the com-ing year. The Committee encourages the Secretary to develop guid-ance to ensure relevant participants and grantees are involved in the Department-wide process of prioritizing evidence needs, includ-ing participating in Department led evaluations. Consistent with program statutes, the Committee encourages the Secretary to en-sure that evidence of effectiveness is a consideration in grant op-portunities. Customer Service .\u2014The Committee continues to support efforts to improve customer service in accordance with Executive Order 13571\u2014Streamlining Service Delivery and Improving Customer Service. The Committee directs the Secretary to develop standards to improve customer service and incorporate the standards into the performance plans required under 31 U.S.C. 1115. The Committee further directs the Department to include an update on the progress of these efforts in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification. Performance Measures .\u2014The Committee directs the Department to comply with title 31 of the United States Code, including the de-velopment of organizational priority goals and outcomes such as performance outcome measures, output measures, efficiency meas-ures, and customer service measures. The Committee further di-rects the Department to include an update on the progress of these efforts in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification. Childhood Poverty .\u2014The Committee is deeply concerned about the 11.9 million children, including 7.5 million Black and Latino children, living in poverty as of 2018. Now, millions more are pro-jected to live in poverty due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Without robust Federal support, a Columbia University study estimates that child poverty could balloon from an already shameful 13.6 per-cent to nearly 21 percent, with Black and Latino children bearing VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, a disproportionate risk of falling into or deeper into poverty. More than 50 percent of low-income households report they or someone in their household has experienced job loss or a pay cut, and more nearly 40 million Americans have lost their jobs to date. During the pandemic, families are stretched thinner than ever and far too many families, especially in communities of color, are struggling to pay the bills and keep the lights on. The Committee recognizes that resources provided for the Department are critical now more than ever to reducing child poverty and racial disparities. However, there is concern that especially with tight budget caps for fiscal year 2021, funding for programs to help children in poverty is not enough. Deep inequities remain for children of color who are often more segregated by neighborhood, lower socioeconomic status, and in K-12 schooling. The Committee requests that the Department looks for opportunities to target resources to communities with the highest child poverty rates to help reduce child poverty and racial disparities, especially in the context of COVID-19, and as the pan-demic threatens to increase child poverty for years to come. Dual Enrollment .\u2014 The Committee notes the value of dual credit programs (as defined under 20 U.S.C. 7801) and directs the Sec-retary to provide a report to the Committees on Appropriations that includes national participation rates in dual credit programs by State, the impact of such programs on high school and post-sec-ondary graduation rates, college preparedness, and postsecondary student debt. Within 180 days of enactment of this Act, the Depart-ment shall brief the Committees on the status of the report and provide national participation rates in dual credit programs by State. Ex-sites .\u2014The Committee directs the Department to provide a briefing to the Committees on Appropriations, the House Com-mittee on Education and Labor, and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions any time it launches a new experimental site or pilot program within 15 days of launching the experimental site or pilot program. The briefing must include, at a minimum, the goals of the experimental site or pilot program, statutory authority, a list of the specific statutory and regulatory requirements that the Secretary intends to waive, and the legal au-thority for such waivers. The Department should also provide to the committees any contracts pertaining to the experimental site or pilot program. Additionally, the Department must submit a report to the committees any time it closes an experimental site or pilot program. The report must include, at a minimum, a summary and analysis of the outcomes, an assessment of the challenges and suc-cesses, and costs. Coding .\u2014The Committee recognizes that, as the American cyber- security workforce shortage continues to grow, our nation becomes increasingly vulnerable to cyber-attacks. The Committee believes it is critical to invest in cyber training for America's youth across a broad field of computer science curricula, including computer cod-ing. Because computer coding plays an essential role in every in-dustry, the Committee supports efforts by the Department to en-courage learning institutions from K-12 to higher education, and career and technical schools to invest in computer science edu-cation, including computer coding instruction. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, Study on Skill Training .\u2014The Committee is concerned that a slow economic recovery and its potential for high levels of long- term unemployment, coupled with the continual shifts in skills sought by employers, pose challenges for the workforce system in the U.S. The Committee recognizes the paramount importance of preparing students and individuals with diverse backgrounds and years of work experience for careers in emerging businesses and in-dustries. Therefore, the Committee requests that the GAO to con-duct a study that examines: (1) promising programs to assist mid- career workers upskill and/or change professions to better align their career opportunities with emerging business and industry needs; (2) promising practices for creating financing options to help students pay for career and technical education with Federal funds, such as those from Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Edu-cation Act, WIOA, and Pell Grant programs; and (3) promising State and/or employer managed programs that provide additional financial support for mid-career workers to pay for career and tech-nical education programs. Additionally, the Committee is aware that the GAO is mandated to review career and technical education programs under section 219 of Public Law 115-224. The Committee is looking forward to learning about similar information related to this study's finding about strategies, policies, practices, and challenges to help ensure all students pursue and complete programs aligned to high skill, high wage occupations using the Carl D. Perkins Career and Tech-nical Education Act funds. OFFICE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $130,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 130,000,000 ............................................................. 132,000,000 Change from ......................................................... +2,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +2,000,000 The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is responsible for enforcing laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, na-tional origin, sex, disability, and age in all programs and institu-tions that receive funds from the Department. These laws extend to SEAs, LEAs, and IHEs, including proprietary schools. They also extend to State rehabilitation agencies, libraries, museums, and other institutions receiving Federal funds. The Committee recommendation includes $132,000,000, which is $2,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and fiscal year 2021 budget request. The Committee directs OCR to use this appropriation to increase its level of full-time equivalent employ-ment in order to effectively and timely investigate complaints; exe-cute and accurately report the civil rights data collection; thor-oughly monitor corrective actions of institutions and meet other critical workloads. Expulsions and Suspensions in Preschool and Primary Edu- cation .\u2014The Committee continues to request from the Department its overdue report on preschool and primary education expulsions and suspensions. The Committee remains deeply concerned about expulsions and suspensions that occur in preschool settings and K-3 classrooms, particularly given the racial and gender disparities that exist. This is problematic given the research that indicates VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, can adversely affect development, health and edu- cation outcomes. The Committee strongly encourages OCR to col-lect annually, from all elementary and secondary schools receiving Federal financial assistance, data on the number and type of sus-pension and expulsions of preschool children and K-12 students, disaggregated by race/ethnicity, sex, disability status, and EL sta-tus. OCR should also submit to the Committees on Appropriations, the Committee on Education and Labor, and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, no later than 180 days after the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, a report detailing school discipline in all preschool and K-12 classrooms, in-cluding the disaggregated data and any disparities by subgroup in disciplinary rates. The report should also include specific rec-ommendations given to schools on expulsions and suspensions, in-cluding highlighting evidence-based interventions, providing con-sumer education specific to each school, and identifying opportuni-ties to improve school climate, including through relevant programs and the provision of technical assistance that helps prevent and se-verely limit expulsion and suspension practices in preschool set-tings and K-3 classrooms, eliminate disparities in the provision of discipline, and ensure the safety and well-being of all young chil-dren. The Committee requests a briefing within 90 days of enact-ment of this Act on the progress the Department is making to-wards these goals. Title IX .\u2014The Committee is concerned with the rates of sexual assault and harassment in schools. The Committee directs OCR to provide a report to further disaggregate data provided in the Civil Rights Data Collection. The report must include an assessment of the FTE status of Title IX coordinators at the LEA and SEA levels, including full-time versus part-time status, and if the Title IX coor-dinator also oversees other civil rights coordinator positions, includ-ing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. In addition to harassment and bullying data, the report should include data on the prevalence of rape in schools. The Com-mittee directs OCR to submit recommendations, no later than 180 days after enactment of this Act, on actions Congress can take to ensure the Department provides full oversight to prevent, mitigate, and address sexual harassment, assault, and rape in schools. In addition, the Committee is deeply concerned with the Depart- ment's Title IX final rule. This rule represents an unprecedented departure from nearly 20 years of Title IX policy shaped by the Su-preme Court and the Department under both Republican and Democratic administrations. The final rule violates the letter and purpose of Title IX, by disproportionately and inappropriately bur-dening complainants at every stage of the Title IX complaint and investigation process such that the cumulative impact of the Final Rule will have a chilling effect on future complaints of sex-based harassment, in an environment where such harassment is already dramatically underreported. Moreover, the final rule also unfairly and unlawfully subjects sexual harassment complaints to a unique-ly burdensome and hostile process that is not required for any other type of student or employee misconduct. When the Depart-ment first proposed the rule in 2018, stakeholders submitted nearly 125,000 comments in response, the vast majority of which urged VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, the Department not to move forward with the rule. It is currently being challenged in four separate lawsuits filed by advocacy and di-rect service organizations and over 18 states and the District of Co-lumbia, with possibly more lawsuits to be filed. The Committee is also troubled that the Administration would pursue this change during the midst of a national emergency. The final rule will divert schools' already sharply limited resources while they operate remotely toward creating and implementing complex new policies before the new school year commences this fall. When students return to class, the Department should help ensure that school and college environments are not only safe from pathogen, but that they are safe from sexual assault and harass-ment, as well. Therefore, the Committee recommendation includes new bill language preventing the implementation of the Depart-ment's final rule, entitled ''Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance'' (85 Fed. Reg. 30,026). Closing of Civil Rights Cases .\u2014The Committee is concerned by the number of civil rights cases, including racial discrimination and sexual harassment, that are closed without any findings of wrong-doing or corrective action, often due to insufficient evidence. The Committee directs the Department to include in its fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification the following information, bro-ken down by jurisdiction: (1) the number of civil rights complaints evaluated; (2) the number of civil rights complaints investigated; (3) the number of civil rights complaints monitored; (4) the number of civil rights complaints that resulted in enforcement action; and, (5) the number civil rights complaints not evaluated and the reason for not evaluating. Disaggregated Data Collection and Reporting on Bullying .\u2014The Committee is concerned about rates of bullying of Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) students. The Committee recognizes data collections by the Department, OCR and the NCES on student bullying insufficiently reflects diversity of AAPI sub-ethnic groups. However, AAPIs are diverse, and the U.S. Census Bureau reports data on at least 25 distinct AAPI ethnic groups. The Committee di-rects the Department to collect and report data on student bullying disaggregated by all racial and ethnic groups and sub-groups iden-tified in the American Community Survey. GAO Study on School Discipline and Students .\u2014The Committee believes teachers and students deserve school environments that are safe, supportive, and conducive to teaching and learning. The Committee is aware of school dress code enforcement disrupting the learning environment of students; various reports of excessive use of force in disciplinary actions at schools across the country; as well as varied interpretations and enforcement of school disturb-ance laws that have resulted in bodily harm of students. Accord-ingly, the Committee requests GAO provide a report within 270 days of enactment of this Act to the Committees on Appropriations examining how school dress codes and discipline policies are formu-lated and executed across the country; examining how students' civil rights may be infringed by enforcement of dress codes and dis-turbance laws; and recommendations on how LEAs and SEAs may reform discipline policies to balance both a safe and educational en-vironment. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul INSPECTOR GENERAL Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $63,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 68,019,000 ............................................................. 64,000,000 Change from ......................................................... +1,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a54,019,000 The Office of Inspector General (OIG) has authority to inquire into all program and administrative activities of the Department as well as into related activities of grant and contract recipients. It conducts audits and investigations to determine compliance with applicable laws and regulations, to check alleged fraud and abuse, efficiency of operations, and effectiveness of results. The Committee recommendation includes new bill language al- lowing the OIG to better respond to unexpected oversight needs by modifying the availability of funds. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $7,000,000 for audit and oversight activities supported with funds appro-priated to the Department in response to COVID-19. The Committee continues to urge the OIG to ensure its focus re- mains on the primary missions of the Office. The Committee cau-tions the Office, when receiving requests from the Department for investigations, to consider the most effective and best use of its re-sources. G ENERAL PROVISIONS Sec. 301.

TITLE IV\u2014RELATED AGENCIES C OMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE FROM PEOPLE WHOAREBLIND OR SEVERELY DISABLED SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $10,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 13,930,000 Committee Recommendation ............................................................. 10,000,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... - - - Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a53,930,000 The Committee believes oversight is necessary to ensure the pro- gram is operating in accordance with statutory requirements that blind or other severely disabled individuals provide at least 75 per-cent of hours of direct labor required for the production or provision of the products or services to Federal government agencies. To en-sure the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Se-verely Disabled (AbilityOne Commission) maintains its oversight capacity, the Committee continues bill language requiring the AbilityOne Commission to establish written agreements with cen-tral nonprofit agencies. The written agreements ensure the AbilityOne Commission can conduct appropriate audit, oversight, and reporting functions in accordance with standard Federal pro-curement policies. The Committee supports opportunities for the Commission to as- sert its authority in the oversight of the AbilityOne program. How-ever, it is concerned about language in the cooperative agreements between the Commission and the Central Nonprofit Agencies (''CNAs'') requiring CNAs to report to the Commission any meet-ings with key stakeholders, including Congressional members and staff. The Committee requests additional information on the jus-tification for and necessity of this language, to be included in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Justification. Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled\u2014Requested Reports .\u2014The Committee continues to re- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, quest the reports listed under this heading in House Report 115- 244. Office of Inspector General .\u2014The Committee recommends not less than $1,650,000 for the Office of Inspector General. CORPORATION FOR NATIONAL AND COMMUNITY SERVICE OPERATING EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $806,529,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 30,105,000 ............................................................. 848,529,000 Change from ......................................................... +42,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +818,424,000 The Committee recommends $848,529,000 for operating expenses for the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), an increase of $42,000,000 over the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The fiscal year 2021 budget request proposes to eliminate CNCS and requests $30,105,000 for this purpose. Volunteers in Service to America The Committee recommends $95,364,000 for Volunteers in Serv- ice to America (VISTA), an increase of $2,000,000 over the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $90,699,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This program provides capacity building for small, community-based organizations with a mission of combating pov-erty. VISTA members raise resources, recruit, and organize volun-teers, and establish and expand programs in housing, employment, health, and economic development. National Senior Volunteer Corps The Committee recommends $239,017,000 for the National Sen- ior Volunteer Corps programs, an increase of $18,000,000 over the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $238,684,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Senior Corps is a collection of programs that connect individuals older than the age of 55 with opportunities to contribute their job skills and expertise to community projects and organizations. The Committee intends for all funding to be used to support pro- grams and volunteers. The funding breakout by program is as follows: National Senior Volunteer Corps FY 2021 Committee Foster Grandparents .................................................................................................... .................... $120,799,000 Senior Program ............................................................................................... ................... 59,355,000 AmeriCorps State and National Grants The Committee recommends $446,510,000 for AmeriCorps State and National Grants, an increase of $18,000,000 over the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $444,286,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This program provides funds to local and na-tional organizations and agencies to address community needs in education, public safety, health, and the environment. AmeriCorps environmental stewardship programs and conserva- tion corps perform year-round, labor-intensive outdoor work to ad- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, needs of land and water man- agement agencies; enhance outdoor recreation opportunities; and, improve the accessibility of public lands. The Committee recognizes the unique role and skillset of these AmeriCorps programs to help communities prepare for, mitigate, respond to, and recover from disasters, including hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, floods, and se-vere drought. The Committee therefore encourages the Corporation to prioritize investment in such programs that serve a dual func-tion to carry out activities, including fuels reduction, post-fire resil-iency and erosion control, tree mortality forest health, vegetation management of invasive species, public lands resource and recre-ation infrastructure improvements, and other related activities, as well as the range of disaster-related services. Innovation, Assistance, and Other Activities The Committee recommends $9,600,000 for Innovation, Assist- ance, and Other Activities, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $9,600,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budg-et request. The Committee continues to support the September 11 National Day of Service and Remembrance and the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Day of Service\u2014two important national events. Evaluation The Committee recommends $4,000,000 for evaluation, which is the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $4,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. These funds support re-search on program effectiveness. National Civilian Community Corps The Committee recommends $34,500,000 for National Civilian Community Corps, an increase of $2,000,000 over the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $11,617,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This program supports residential, team-based service opportunities for individuals aged18 24. State Commission Administrative Grants The Committee recommends $19,538,000 for State Commission Support Grants, an increase of $2,000,000 over the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $19,538,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget re-quest. Funds are used for formula grants to support State oversight of service programs.

The study shall be submitted to the Committees on Appro-priations no later than 240 days after enactment of this Act. The Committee is interested in improving outcomes related to reducing maternal and infant mortality; increasing employment and wages for low-income individuals, including disconnected youth; increas-ing postsecondary credential attainment for high-need students; and, improving outcomes for children and youth in foster care. The Committee recognizes the importance of interagency coordination and directs CNCS to review similar models implemented between Federal agencies and the private sector in order to evaluate lessons learned and determine potential and plausibility of implementa-tion, including an evaluation of the feasibility for regional and local partnerships. Evidence-based Grant Making. \u2014The Committee is supportive of efforts by the Corporation to consider evidence of effectiveness in grant competitions.The Committee encourages CNCS to develop guidance to ensure relevant participants and grantees are involved in the Corporation-wide process of prioritizing evidence needs, in-cluding participating in CNCS led evaluations.Consistent with pro-gram statutes, the Committee encourages CNCS to ensure that evi-dence of effectiveness is a consideration in grant opportunities. Childhood Poverty. \u2014The Committee is deeply concerned about the 11.9 million children, including 7.5 million Black and Latino children, living in poverty as of 2018. Now, millions more are pro-jected to live in poverty due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Without robust Federal support, a Columbia University study estimates that child poverty could balloon from an already shameful 13.6 per-cent to nearly 21 percent, with Black and Latino children bearing a disproportionate risk of falling into or deeper into poverty. More than 50 percent of low-income households report they or someone in their household has experienced job loss or a pay cut, and more nearly 40 million Americans have lost their jobs to date. During the pandemic, families are stretched thinner than ever and far too many families, especially in communities of color, are struggling to pay the bills and keep the lights on. The Committee recognizes that resources provided for CNCS are critical now more than ever to re-ducing child poverty and racial disparities. However, there is con-cern that especially with tight budget caps for fiscal year 2021, funding for programs to help children in poverty is not enough. Deep inequities remain for children of color who are often more segregated by neighborhood, lower socioeconomic status, and in K- 12 schooling. The Committee requests that CNCS looks for oppor-tunities to target resources to communities with the highest child VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, poverty rates to help reduce child poverty and racial disparities, es- pecially in the context of COVID-19, and as the pandemic threat-ens to increase child poverty for years to come.

C ORPORATION FORPUBLIC BROADCASTING Appropriation, fiscal year 2022 ......................................................... $465,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023 ....................................................... - - - Committee Recommendation ............................................................. 515,000,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +50,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +515,000,000 The Committee recommends $515,000,000 as an advance appro- priation for fiscal year 2023, an increase of $50,000,000 over the fiscal year 2022 advance. The fiscal year 2021 budget request pro-poses to eliminate the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and requests $30,000,000 for this purpose in fiscal year 2021. In addition, the Committee recommendation includes $20,000,000 in fiscal year 2021 for continued support of CPB in replacing and up-grading the public broadcasting interconnection system and further investing in system-wide infrastructure and services. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $75,000,000 for stabilization grants to maintain programming services and to preserve small and rural public telecommunication stations. National Multicultural Alliance. \u2014According to the Public Broad- casting Act, one of the greatest priorities of public broadcasting is to address the ''needs of unserved and underserved audiences, par-ticularly children and minorities.'' Programming that reflects the histories and perspectives of diverse racial and ethnic communities VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, is a core value and responsibility of public broadcasting. Therefore, the Committee supports continued investment in the National Multicultural Alliance to help accomplish this goal. The Corpora-tion is directed to provide a briefing to the Committee within 90 days of enactment of this Act on this investment. Continued Access to Public Broadcasting. \u2014The Committee recog- nizes the importance of continued access to public broadcasting in local communities. The Committee directs Federally funded public radio stations to engage in public-private partnerships with State and local entities, including nonprofits, in this effort. The Com-mittee looks forward to information in the fiscal year 2022 Con- gressional Budget Justification on how public private partnerships may be used to ensure continued access to public broadcasting in underserved areas. Diversity and Inclusion. \u2014The Committee recognizes the impor- tance of diversity and inclusion in television and radio program-ming. The Committee requests CPB include in its fiscal years 2022/ 2024 Congressional Budget Justification information on its diver-sity and inclusion efforts, including programming supported by funding from the Corporation, as well as professional development opportunities and services for individuals from underrepresented communities.

The fiscal year 2021 budget request proposes to eliminate IMLS. These funds provide administrative and management support for all programs administered by IMLS. The Committee also includes $3,013,000 for IMLS' activities in policy, research, and data collec-tion, including functions formerly conducted by the National Com-mission on Libraries and Information Science. Holocaust Education and Survivor Stories. \u2014The Committee is aware that the number of Holocaust survivors in the U.S. is dimin-ishing every month due to the advanced age of the survivors. The Committee continues to commend the work museums, libraries and archives are doing to preserve the memories and to educate the public of the Holocaust. The Committee encourages IMLS to sup-port the work organizations are doing across the country to pre-serve and present the living memories of Holocaust survivors in an interactive format, which can help educate future generations about the atrocities of the Holocaust. The Committee commends passage of the Never Again Education Act (P.L. 116-141) that will enhance education programming on the Holocaust and genocide prevention through the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.

N ATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $274,224,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 246,876,000 ............................................................. 277,824,000 Change from ......................................................... +3,600,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +30,948,000 The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is an independent agency responsible for enforcing U.S. labor law related to collective VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, bargaining and unfair labor practices, including the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935. The Committee includes $277,824,000 for the NLRB, which is $3,600,000 more than the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $30,948,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request. Within this amount, $1,000,000 is provided, along with new bill language, for the Board to develop and implement an electronic voting system. In March 2020, the Subcommittee held an oversight and budget hearing with NLRB, and members raised several urgent concerns, including conflicts of interest by Board members and financial mis-management of the Board's resources. Unfortunately, in response to questions by the Subcommittee, Chairman Ring and General Counsel Robb communicated ambivalence toward correcting these problems. As a result, the Committee includes new bill language and directives that build on oversight language included in House Report 116-62 and in the explanatory statement accompanying the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Edu-cation, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2020. The Committee is concerned regarding NLRB personnel and obli- gation practices over the past few fiscal years. Such practices have contributed to significant underspending on personnel costs, which raises serious concerns about the ability of the NLRB to conduct quality casework. As a result of these practices, NLRB has had higher than historical funding lapses for fiscal years 2018 and 2019. The Committee expects NLRB to address this challenge by posting position openings to restore critical field staff capacity and to more aggressively fill vacancies in fiscal year 2021, including the remaining open regional director positions. To ensure NLRB makes progress toward addressing this issue, new bill language is in-cluded to direct the Board to expand the number of regional full- time equivalent staff beyond the amount on-board at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. Within 90 days of enactment of this Act, NLRB is directed to brief the Committees on Appropria-tions on its plans for addressing these critical hiring challenges. Further, NLRB is directed to submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations within 90 days of enactment of this Act detailing the resources dedicated to regional offices. Such report should in-clude actual and planned data, as applicable, for each fiscal year 2011 through 2022: (1) the number of employees stationed in each regional office at the end of each fiscal year, and (2) administrative expenses by object class for each regional office. In addition, the Committee directs the Board to provide monthly staffing reports to the Committees on Appropriations that will include the total num-ber of employees in each position for each regional office, attrition for each office, new hires for each office, and any information on plans to incentivize or encourage employee separations. To further address these concerns, the Committee recommenda- tion includes new bill language to prohibit the NLRB or the Board's General Counsel from using funds to restructure the agen-cy unless the NLRB submits its plan 240 days in advance to the Committees on Appropriations and to the Comptroller General. The Committee continues to be concerned by questions of con- flicts of interest surrounding NLRB board members. The Board has shown an alarming disinterest in eliminating the appearance of VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, through its numerous rulemaking processes. To address these concerns, the Committee directs the Board to provide the Committees on Appropriations with a report no less than 90 days of enactment of this Act on the involvement of Board members in any rulemakings conducted by the Board on a subject matter that any entity listed on any current or past Board Member Recusal List. The Committee is concerned with negative impacts of the memo- randum issued by the General Counsel of the NLRB on March 13, 2019 with the subject ''Noting Respondents' Failure to Cooperate with ULP Investigations in Subsequently-Issued Complaints.'' The Committee directs the Board to provide a report to the Committees no later than 90 days of enactment of this Act from the General Counsel on the impact of that guidance, which shall include, but not be limited to, the impact on the rate of case deferral and the impact on the number of cases settled prior to complaints being filed during fiscal year 2020 compared to the three previous fiscal years. The Committee directs the NLRB to restore regional directors' unfettered discretion to take action and respond to local conditions to protect employee health and safety. These actions include but are not limited to mandatory and liberal telework designations, physical office closures, mail ballot representation elections, and re-mote representation hearings. The Committee directs the NLRB to respect and enforce the whistleblower rights of its employees. The NLRB shall not apply and incorporate non-disclosure policies without notifying employees of their disclosure rights and shall not threaten employees with re-taliation for lawful disclosures of agency documents consistent with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302. The Committee urges the NLRB to address employee health and safety concerns and to restore employee access to health units. The Committee continues to be concerned by the NLRB's joint employer rule, which will make it easier for unscrupulous employ-ers to sidestep their legal responsibility to bargain with their em-ployees. Therefore, the Committee recommendations includes new bill language to prohibit the use of funds for implementation of the final rule on The Standard for Determining Joint-Employer Status issued by the NLRB, published in the Federal Register on Feb-ruary 26, 2020 (Vol. 85, No. 38) (Docket No. RIN 3142-AA13), or to take any actions in furtherance of this final rule. The Committee opposes the Board's recently published rules re- garding union elections. These rules will mandate longer delays be-fore union election, creating more opportunity for employers to run sophisticated anti-union campaigns. The rules will also invite cor-porations to initiate complex litigation before union elections to cause additional complexity and delays. Therefore, the Committee recommendation includes new bill language to prohibit the use of funds for implementation of the final rule on Representation-Case Procedures issued by the NLRB, published in the Federal Register on December 18, 2019 (Vol. 84, No. 243) (Docket No. RIN 3142-AAl 2), or to take any actions in furtherance of this final rule.

The Committee recognizes the continued success of the NMB in mediating collectively bargained contracts in the rail and air travel industries. However, the Committee is concerned that there is a lag in mediating cases, increasing the length of time cases are being addressed and cleared. The Committee urges the NMB to prioritize resources on the administration of the agency and staffing needs and to address the backlog of Section 3 arbitration cases at the NMB. The Committee urges the Board to focus on accomplishing its statutory mission in a timely manner and abstain from unneces- sary rulemaking activities or the development of regulatory changes. The Committee directs the NMB to report to the Committees on Appropriations and the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure within 60 days of enactment of this Act on the sta-tus of mediation, pursuant to 45 U.S.C. Sec. 155 First (a), of collec-tive bargaining disputes pertaining to the craft or class of flight kitchen, commissary, airline catering, and related employees. If any party to such mediation requests that the mediation be termi-nated, the Committee directs the Board to report to the Commit-tees on Appropriations and the House Committee on Transpor-tation and Infrastructure within 30 days of such request on its re-sponse to the request and the reason or reasons for its response. Any report made pursuant to this paragraph should include the date that mediation began, the number and length of mediation sessions, an explanation why mediation has not been successful in bringing about an amicable settlement, what further steps the NMB intends to take, and whether mediation is likely to bring about an amicable settlement within a reasonable period of time.

R AILROAD RETIREMENT BOARD DUAL BENEFITS PAYMENTS ACCOUNT Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $16,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 13,000,000 ............................................................. 13,000,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... \u00a53,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - This appropriation is authorized by the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 to fund vested dual benefits received by railroad retirees who, under prior law, would have become covered by both the rail-road retirement system and the Social Security system because railroad retirement was not fully coordinated with Social Security from 1937 to 1974. The Committee includes a provision permitting a portion of these funds to be derived from income tax receipts on dual benefits as authorized by law. The Railroad Retirement Board (''RRB'') estimates that approximately $1,000,000 may be derived in this manner. FEDERAL PAYMENT TO THE RAILROAD RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $150,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 150,000 Committee Recommendation ............................................................. 150,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... - - - Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - LIMITATION ON ADMINISTRATION Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $123,500,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 120,225,000 ............................................................. 126,500,000 Change from ......................................................... +3,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +6,275,000 The Committee includes $13,000,000 for the implementation of information technology systems modernization efforts. Within 180 days of enactment of this Act, the Railroad Retirement Board is di-rected to submit a comprehensive update to the Committees on Ap-propriations on project status, timelines to completion, and total cost of development. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $5,000,000 to support telework and administration of the Railroad Unemploy-ment Insurance Act. LIMITATION ON THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $11,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 11,499,000 Committee Recommendation ............................................................. 11,000,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... - - - Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a5499,000 VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION PAYMENTS TO SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUNDS Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $11,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 11,000,000 Committee Recommendation ............................................................. 11,000,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... - - - Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - This appropriation provides reimbursement to the Social Security trust funds for non-trust fund activities. SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME PROGRAM Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $41,714,889,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 40,308,177,000 ............................................................. 40,172,492,000 Change from ......................................................... \u00a51,542,397,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a5135,685,000 The Committee recommends $19,600,000,000 in advance funding for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as requested. Research and Demonstration Section 1110 of the Social Security Act provides authority to the Social Security Administration (SSA) for conducting research and demonstration projects related to SSA's programs. Within the appropriation for Supplemental Security Income (SSI), the Committee recommends $86,000,000 for research and demonstration activities, which is $15,000,000 below the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and equal to the fiscal year 2021 budget re-quest. Administration Within the appropriation for SSI, the Committee recommends $4,490,058,000, which is $203,169,000 above the fiscalyear2020 en-acted level and $135,685,000 below the fiscal year 2021 budget re-quest. This funding is for payment to the Social Security trust funds for SSI's share of the administrative expenses of SSA. LIMITATION ON ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $11,157,945,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 11,640,473,000 ............................................................. 11,259,945,000 Change from ......................................................... +102,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a5380,528,000 The Limitation on Administrative Expenses (LAE) funds the ad- ministrative and operational costs for administering the Old Age and Survivors Insurance, Disability Insurance, and Supplemental Security Income programs, and associated costs for support to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in administering their programs. The Committee remains concerned about the excessive waiting times, benefit delays, and service problems faced every day by Americans who are trying to access their earned benefits. The rec-ommendation includes an increase of $102,000,000, which com-bined with new funding provided in the Further Consolidated Ap-propriations Act, 2020 (P.L. 116-94), provides over $200,000,000 for SSA to replace losses in field offices, teleservice and processing VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul centers, and build additional capacity so that offices can function at appropriate levels. The Committee acknowledges SSA's progress in reducing exces- sive and harmful delays for people waiting for a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge, which has been facilitated by $390,000,000 in dedicated funding provided in fiscal years 2017 through 2020. The Committee understands that SSA anticipated eliminating its hearing backlog in fiscal year 2021, but is concerned that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on SSA's service deliv-ery may lead to new delays. The bill includes $50,000,000 for ac-tivities that will eliminate the disability hearing backlog in fiscal year 2021. The bill continues to provide $45,000,000 in dedicated funding for Information Technology Modernization, with $4,000,000 of such funding available for IT Modernization efforts of the SSA Office of Inspector General. In addition, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included $338,000,000 for SSA, with $300,000,000 to support essential telework, communication needs, and salaries and benefits of Fed-eral employees impacted by office closures, and $38,000,000 for the purposes of issuing emergency assistance Economic Impact Pay-ments. Administrative Appeals Hearings. \u2014The Committee considers the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) ''Hearings Held by Admin-istrative Appeals Judges of the Appeals Council'' (84 Fed. Reg. 70080, December 20, 2019) to be an unjustified erosion of due proc-ess for individuals who are appealing a denial of Social Security or SSI benefits. As part of a beneficiary's right to an impartial appeal process, an on-the-record hearing, conducted by an impartial judge with decisional independence, must be conducted in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act to ensure due process, with-out agency interference, or political bias. Replacing this appeals step and the role of independent administrative law judges (ALJ)s with SSA employees, jeopardizes the independence of the process. In light of the harm that would be caused by this policy change, the Committee strongly urges SSA to immediately withdraw this proposed rule. Administrative Law Judge Selection. \u2014The Committee is deeply concerned about the impact of Presidential Executive Order 13843 on the judicial independence of administrative law judges (ALJs). The Order eliminates the competitive hiring process for ALJs and has the potential impact of converting independent adjudicators to political appointees, undermining longstanding principles of fair and unbiased consideration of matters of vital importance to the American people. ALJs must be independent decision-makers and it is the Committee's expectation that SSA maintain the highest standards for appointment of ALJs. The Committee directs the Ad-ministration to develop and submit to the Committees on Appro-priations, Ways and Means,and Oversight and Reform, a report on hiring processes, to include an explanation of the process, qualifica-tion standards, and criteria used to recruit, evaluate and hire ALJs. Continuing Disability Reviews. \u2014The Committee is disappointed that the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) ''Rules Regarding the Frequency and Notice of Continuing Disability Reviews'' (84 VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul Reg. 63588, November 18, 2019) proposes a massive increase in CDRs without any evidence of its necessity or appropriateness. The Committee believes the NPRM is a harmful and unjustified at-tempt, under the guise of fiscal prudence, to deprive many people with disabilities of the Social Security, SSI, Medicare, and Med-icaid benefits that they are eligible for and rely on for survival. The Committee directs the Administration to carefully review the com-ments received on this proposed rule, which were overwhelmingly negative. The Committee strongly urges SSA to withdraw the rule and instead use its limited resources to restore strong customer services and address the backlogs and other service issues that have become too common across the agency in recent years. Disability Payments. \u2014The late payment of Social Security Dis- ability Insurance claims creates an excessive burden on claimants waiting for their Social Security Disability Insurance back pay. The Committee directs SSA to work with the relevant stakeholders to evaluate national and regional payment trends and implement changes to its disability payments process that would ensure that SSA pays all Social Security Disability Insurance claims within 60 days of receiving a fee request pursuant to 20 CFR 404.1725. The Committee further directs SSA to report to Congress within 90 days on the specific policies SSA has implemented, or has consid-ered, to streamline the disability payments' process and to ensure consistent timeliness of payment across all local service areas. Electronic Consent Based Social Security Number Verification System Implementation. \u2014The Committee supports continued im- plementation of the Electronic Consent Based Social Security Num-ber Verification system (eCBSV) in accordance with section 215 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (P.L. 115-174). The Committee notes the draft user agreement published in the Federal Register (Volume 85, Number 47) on Tuesday, March 10, 2020 presents requirements that may limit the utility of the eCBSV as a tool to fight identity fraud and protect consumers, including minors. The Committee encourages SSA to be consistent with the E-SIGN Act with regards to electronic consent and to keep the Committee informed of any delays to timelines for implementation. Information Technology. \u2014The Committee continues to monitor the Information Technology (IT) Modernization Plan and encour-ages SSA to focus on improvements to customer service and effi-ciency improvements for customers and employees as it makes up-dates to the plan. The Committee requests an update of the plan referenced under this heading in House Report 114-699. Labor-Management Relations. \u2014The Committee is concerned that persistent labor-management relations problems are undermining the vital work of the SSA. Within 180 days of enactment of this Act, SSA is directed to submit to the Committee a plan, developed in consultation with labor organizations representing its workforce, to improve workplace morale and to strengthen employee recruit-ment and retention, to better serve the American people. Mailing Paper Statements. \u2014The Committee is concerned that SSA continues to not mail Social Security benefits and earning statements to all contributors aged 25 and older not yet receiving benefits, in accordance with Section 1143 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b-13). The Committee directs the Administration to VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, include in its annual Congressional Budget Justifica- tion the estimated costs for mailing paper statements to all contrib-utors aged 25 or older and not yet receiving benefits, as required by law. National Medical Evidence. \u2014The Committee encourages SSA to consider additional innovations and technological resources that could efficiently and effectively support state Disability Determina-tion agencies and the Office of Hearings and Appeals in medical evidence collection, data analytics, and quality assurance. Pilot Program Metrics. \u2014The Committee appreciates the informa- tion on pilot program metrics provided in the fiscal year 2021 Con-gressional Budget Justification. The Committee expects that, prior to undertaking any new pilots, SSA will ensure that it has devel-oped a research design that identifiesa clear purpose for the pilot, key objectives and an evaluation plan, including adequate metrics to determine the pilot's effectiveness. Metrics should be specific, quantifiable measures\u2014accompanied by specific goals for the meas-ures\u2014that can be used to evaluate success. The Committee re-minds SSA that it uses the term ''pilot'' to encompass all efforts to test the effects of process changes, including ''initiatives'' and ''tests.'' The Committee directs SSA to include in its fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification a description of all pilots con-ducted in fiscal years 2020 and 2021, or proposed for fiscal year 2022; the purpose and key objectives of each pilot; its start date and timeline; which SSA components are involved in the pilot; the evaluation plan; the measures or metrics the SSA will use to evalu-ate the pilot; and a specific goal for each metric that will be used to determine the pilot's effectiveness. All SSA pilots should be in-cluded in the justification, including those undertaken as part of the Compassionate and Responsive Service (CARES) plan and in other parts of the agency. The justification does not need to include programmatic demonstrations, such as those involving changes in program eligibility rules. Reconsideration. \u2014The Committee continues to be concerned about the delays that may result due to SSA's decision to reinstate reconsideration in ten States despite bipartisan and bicameral con-cern for reinstatement. The Committee's concern is heightened as the COVID-19 pandemic creates new service delivery challenges for the State Disability Determination Services agencies. The Com-mittee looks forward to receiving and reviewing the plan requested under this section in House Report 116-62, and urges SSA to keep the Committee informed of any systematic process delays or feed-back received from the States as reconsideration is reinstated. Replacement Card Fees. \u2014The Committee continues to reject the proposal to charge a fee to replace a lost or stolen Social Security card and directs the Administration to not move forward with this proposal. Report on LAE Expenditures. \u2014The Committee continues to re- quest that the data referenced under this heading in House Report 114-699 be included in future budget justifications. In addition, the Committee requests the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Jus-tification include a historical table of costs and fiscal year 2022 re-quests for personnel and benefits, by major SSA component to in-clude Operations (field offices, teleservice centers, processing cen- VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Office of Hearings Operations; Systems; Office of Analytics, Review, and Oversight; and Headquarters. State-Reported Data. \u2014The Committee believes that accurate, timely and complete death data is important for the integrity of public programs, and that allowing all Federal agencies to have se-cure access to complete death data for program integrity purposes would help detect and prevent improper payments. The Committee recognizes that although SSA has access to confirmed death data through negotiated data-sharing agreements with States, and shares such data with certain Federal agencies, current law pro-hibits sharing such data more widely. The Committee support ef-forts of other Federal agencies to obtain this data, and urges SSA to accommodate any Office of Management and Budget (OMB) re-quests for consultation on how other agencies can obtain this State- reported data. Telework. \u2014The Committee stresses its long-standing support for well-managed telework programs in the Federal workplace and is concerned about recent reductions in telework at SSA. Within 60 days of enactment of this Act, SSA is directed to submit a report to the Committee to explain each decision by SSA to reduce telework availability on or after October 1, 2019, which shall in-clude any metrics used by SSA to reach these determinations, and an impact assessment on human capital in hiring and retention, in-creases to transit and parking subsidies, office space and utility needs changes, lost productivity and morale decline due to lost telework. In addition, the Committee notes that SSA could have been bet- ter prepared to ensure continuity of operations and deal with the challenges associated with working from home during the COVID- 19 pandemic if it had a clearly defined and operational telework program in place for its employees. The Committee directs SSA to evaluate the use of telework during the COVID-19 pandemic, as-sess the feasibility of telework in all components of SSA, and pro-vide to the Committee a report on such evaluation and assessment within 60 days of enactment of this Act. Video Hearings. \u2014The Committee appreciates that SSA preserved an individual's right to an in-person hearing before an SSA Admin-istrative Law Judge (ALJ), rather than pursuing the original pro-posal in Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ''Setting the Manner for the Appearance of Parties and Witnesses at a Hearing,'' (83 Fed. Reg. 57368, November 15, 2018). The Committee understands that during the COVID-19 pandemic, SSA is also providing claimants with the option of a telephone hearing, or a postponement if the individual would prefer to wait until an in-person or video hearing is available. The Committee expects that once the COVID-19 pan-demic ends SSA will resume in-person hearings on the same basis as prior to the pandemic. The Committee continues to encourage SSA to work with claimants who need additional flexibility by al-lowing a claimant to choose to use video hearings on a voluntary basis or to have an in-person hearing or proceeding if the party chooses to do so. Vocational Factors. \u2014The Committee believes the Final Rule, ''Removing Inability to Communicate in English as an Education Category'' (85 Fed. Reg. 10586, February 25, 2020) will unjustifiably deny Social Security and SSI benefits to nearly VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul 08, older workers with long-term or fatal medical impairments who are severely limited in their functional capacity and who can-not communicate in English. The Committee is disappointed this rule was finalized without regard to the overwhelming opposition and significant concerns raised in public comments and from Mem-bers of Congress. Social Security Advisory Board The Committee recommends $2,500,000 for the Social Security Advisory Board (SSAB), equal to the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $2,000,000 below the fiscal year 2021 budget request. User Fees In addition to the other amounts provided, the Committee rec- ommends $136,000,000 for administrative activities funded from user fees. Of this amount, $135,000,000 is derived from fees col-lected from States that request SSA to administer State SSI sup-plementary payments. The remaining $1,000,000 is derived from fees charged to non-attorneys who apply for certification to rep-resent claimants under titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act. Continuing Disability Reviews and Redeterminations The Committee recommends $1,575,000,000 for program integ- rity activities. This includes the maximum cap adjustment author-ized in the Budget Control Act. The Committee continues bill lan-guage allowing for the transfer of up to $11,200,000 to the Office of the Inspector General for the cost of jointly operating co-opera-tive disability investigation units. OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL Appropriation, fiscal year 2020 ......................................................... $105,500,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2021 ....................................................... 116,000,000 Committee Recommendation ............................................................. 105,500,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... - - - Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a510,500,000 The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) is responsible for meet- ing the statutory mission of promoting economy, efficiency, and ef-fectiveness in the administration of SSA programs and operations and to prevent and detect fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanage-ment in such programs and operations.

TITLE VI\u2014EMERGENCY FUNDING C ENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION CDC-WIDE ACTIVITIES Committee Recommendation ............................................................. $9,000,000,000. The Committee includes $9,000,000,000 in multi-year emergency funding for programs and activities at the Centers for Disease Con-trol and Prevention (CDC) to enhance public health and emergency preparedness and response capacities to better prepare for future public health emergencies. Within the total, the Committee includes the following amounts: VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul \u2014The Committee includes $4,000,000,000 for an enhanced influenza vaccination campaign, in-cluding the purchase of vaccine as necessary to increase coverage to reduce the double wave of virus infections, and to enhance the domestic vaccination infrastructure for scaled-up operations in fis-cal year 2021, including preparedness, operations, distribution, and a comprehensive campaign to achieve coverage goals. CDC must be prepared to build upon its established vaccine distribution network for rapid and substantial expansion. The Director of the CDC is required to brief the Committees on Appropriations at least one week prior to obligating emergency funding on vaccination campaigns. Global Disease Detection and Emergency Response. \u2014The Com- mittee includes $1,000,000,000 to strengthen global public health preparedness and response capacity\u2014including surveillance, lab-oratory, workforce, and emergency operations\u2014to detect epidemic threats earlier, respond more effectively, and prevent avoidable outbreaks. Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund. \u2014The Com- mittee includes $400,000,000 to increase the amount of available funding to quickly respond to a future, imminent infectious disease crisis.

The Committee initiated this effort in fiscal year 2020, provided significant multi-year resources in the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136), continued support in the fiscal year 2021 CDC appropriation in this bill, and with this emergency funding com-pletes the foundational investment for this critical initiative. Public Health Workforce .\u2014The Committee supports the essential infrastructure of a robust and well-trained public health workforce and includes $200,000,000 for workforce development, including doubling the Epidemic Intelligence Service fellowship program over five years, and the expansion of other public health workforce pro-grams so that CDC and State and local health departments are able to recruit and retain skilled staff.

N ATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR Committee Recommendation ............................................................. $5,000,000,000 The Committee includes $5,000,000,000 in emergency funding in the Office of the Director to support biomedical research\u2014including VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:26 Jul for current grantees to cover the shutdown costs, startup costs, and other costs related to delays in research in 2020. In 2020, most research laboratories ceased to operate out of safe- ty concerns. Institutions incurred the costs of these shutdowns, and will also incur the cost of reopening these labs when doing so is safe and feasible. The resulting delays in ongoing research will also have a financial impact on research institutions. The emergency funds provided to NIH in this bill will help research institutions to address this financial burden and return to conducting lifesaving research as quickly and safely as possible. The Director of the NIH is required to brief the Committees on Appropriations at least one week prior to obligating emergency funding. O FFICE OF THE SECRETARY PUBLIC HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES EMERGENCY FUND Committee Recommendation ............................................................. $4,500,000,000 The Committee includes $4,500,000,000 for programs and activi- ties under the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).
