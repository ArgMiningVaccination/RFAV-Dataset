The project will have two phases. Phase 1 is an observational study, in which 120 people will be assessed to evaluate the effects of chronic cannabis use on ART drug concentrations, mood, and thinking. In Phase 2, the study will administer cannabis (or placebo) to 40 people to examine its acute effects on ART drug concentrations. San Diego, California [Cannabis Use, Cognition, and the Endocannabinoid System in HIV](https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT04883255) open to eligible people ages 18-65 Understanding how co-morbidities in persons with HIV (PWH) such as substance use affect risk-taking, decision-making, and other cognitive behaviors is important given implications for everyday functioning and transmission risk. The high prevalence of cannabis use in PWH, medicinally and recreationally, may indicate disease severity, impart therapeutic benefits, or adverse consequences. In fact, cannabis is recommended to those with HIV to alleviate nausea, improve appetite, relieve pain, and lift mood. To-date, the consequences of cannabis use in PWH remain unclear as do potential interactions with HIV treatments. In healthy participants, heavy cannabis use is associated with cognitive deficits e.g., risky decision-making, response disinhibition and inattention, but pro-cognitive effects in PWH may exist at mild use levels due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-excitotoxic properties. Furthermore, little has been done to determine the effects of cannabis use on the endocannabinoid (EC) system in general or in PWH. This study will determine the effects of the two primary cannabis constituents (9-tetrahydrocannabinol [THC], cannabidiol [CBD]) vs. placebo on risky decision-making, response inhibition, reward learning, temporal perception, and motivation, plus EC and homovanillic acid (HVA; a surrogate for dopamine activity) levels in HIV+ and HIV- subjects. Participants with infrequent cannabis use will undergo baseline cognitive testing and biomarker assays with antiretrovirals (ART) use quantified. They will be randomized to a 5-day course of either THC, CBD, or placebo and return for follow-up testing and re-assaying of ECs and HVA levels. San Diego, California [CBD for Sleep in People With HIV](https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT05097651) open to eligible people ages 18 years and up This study will obtain preliminary information about whether, and at what dose, cannabidiol (CBD) may help with insomnia in people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The study will be a 5-week randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled phase II trial using daily oral CBD doses between 50mg and 600mg. Sleep problems will be measured using a wrist-worn device and by self-report. Performance on tests of thinking skills will be compared before and after CBD/placebo treatment. Positive study results will provide support for the use of CBD as a potential treatment for insomnia. San Diego, California [Doravirine for Persons With Excessive Weight Gain on Integrase Inhibitors and Tenofovir Alafenamide](https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT04636437) open to eligible people ages 18 years and up The primary purpose of this study is to see if people with HIV who had a significant weight gain after starting INSTI (integrase strand transfer inhibitor)+TAF/FTC (tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine) (TAF/3TC (lamivudine)) regimen could either slow their rate of weight gain or lose weight within about 1 year if they switch to a regimen containing doravirine (DOR; a newer, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor medication). The study will also try to see if participants changing from TAF/FTC (or TAF/3TC) to TDF/FTC (or TDF/3TC) will experience less additional weight gain or a reduction in overall body weight at 48 weeks compared to persons continued on an INSTI + TAF/FTC (or TAF/3TC) combination. INSTINs bictegravir (BIC), dolutegravir (DTG), or raltegravir (RAL). Additionally, the study will see whether a change in ART can affect things like waist circumference, metabolic and cardiovascular health, fat and lean mass body composition, bone health, and maintenance of virologic suppression. Finally, the study will look at the safety and tolerability of DOR plus either TAF/FTC (or TAF/3TC) versus TDF/FTC (or TDF/3TC). San Diego, California and other locations [Doxycycline for Emphysema in People Living With HIV (The DEPTH Trial)](https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT05382208) open to eligible people ages 30 years and up The purpose of this study is to determine if doxycycline will reduce progression of emphysema in people living with HIV. The secondary objectives are to examine the effects of doxycycline on change in quantity of emphysema, six minute walk distance, patient reported outcomes, ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity. Secondary objectives will also describe the safety and tolerability of doxycycline and determine if doxycycline is associated with development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. San Diego, California and other locations [HOPE in Action Trial of HIV+ Deceased Donor Liver Transplants for HIV+ Recipients](https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT03734393) open to eligible people ages 18 years and up The primary objective of this study is to determine if an HIV-infected donor liver (HIVD+) transplant is safe with regards to major transplant-related and HIV-related complications San Diego, California and other Rituximab, Etoposide, Prednisone, Vincristine Sulfate, Cyclophosphamide, With HIV-Positive Stage II-IV Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphomas](https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT03220022) open to eligible people ages 18 years and up This phase I trial studies the side effect and best dose of ibrutinib in combination with rituximab, etoposide, prednisone, vincristine sulfate, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin hydrochloride patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive stage II-IV diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as etoposide, prednisone, vincristine sulfate, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving ibrutinib and etoposide, prednisone, vincristine sulfate, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin hydrochloride may work better in treating patients with HIV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. La Jolla, California and other locations [LinkPositively: A Technology-Delivered Peer Navigation and Social Networking Intervention to Improve HIV Care](https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT04199052) open to eligible people ages 18 years and up Investigators will develop and pilot test a culturally tailored, trauma-informed smartphone app, called LinkPositively, for Black WLHA affected by interpersonal violence. Core components of LinkPositively include: a) Virtual Peer Navigation that includes phone and text check-ins and 4 weekly one-on-one video sessions to build skills to cope with barriers and navigate care; b) Social Networking platform to receive peer support; c) Educational and Self-care database with healthy living and self-care tips; d) GPS-enabled Resource Locator for HIV care and ancillary support service agencies; and e) ART self-monitoring and reminder system. The study will be conducted in 2 phases with corresponding aims. In Phase 1 (Aim 1), 4 focus groups with Black WLHA with experiences of interpersonal violence, one focus group with peer navigators, and 4-6 key informant interviews with providers will be conducted to determine which app features, content, and functions are most likely to support downloading, initiating use, and sustaining engagement over time. Aim 1 will culminate in usability testing by Black WLHA affected by interpersonal violence (n=8), to finalize intervention components and procedures. In Phase 2 (Aim 2), investigators will pilot test LinkPositively to assess feasibility and acceptability and determine preliminary effects of the intervention on HIV care outcomes (i.e., retention in care, ART adherence, viral suppression) and mechanism of change variables (i.e., social support, self-efficacy). Through a randomized control trial (RCT), participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention arm (n=40) or control arm (Ryan White standard of care, n=40), with follow-up at 3- and 6- months. This study will benefit the advancement of HIV prevention science by harnessing technology to promote engagement in HIV care, while improving social support through peers and social networking-all under the auspices of being trauma-informed for Black WLHA with experiences of interpersonal violence. San Diego, California [Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in Treating Patients With HIV Associated Relapsed or Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma or Solid Tumors That Are Metastatic or Cannot Be Removed by Surgery](https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT02408861) open to eligible people ages 18 years and up This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of nivolumab when given with ipilimumab in treating patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) associated classical Hodgkin lymphoma that has returned after a period of improvement (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory), or solid tumors that have spread from where it first started to other places in the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Ipilimumab is an antibody that acts against a molecule called cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4). CTLA-4 controls a part of the immune system by shutting it down. Nivolumab is a type of antibody that is specific for human programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), a protein that is responsible for destruction of immune cells. Giving ipilimumab with nivolumab may work better in treating patients with HIV associated classical Hodgkin lymphoma or solid tumors compared to ipilimumab with nivolumab alone. La Jolla, California and other locations [Onboarding Positives and PrEP Users to Engage Negatives (OPPEN): Peer-driven Education to Link YMSM of Color to PrEP](https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT05356910) open to eligible males ages 18-34 Onboarding Positives and PrEP users to Engage Negatives (OPPEN) is an intervention to train young Latino and Black men who have sex with men (YMSM of color) living with HIV or using pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to promote PrEP use among HIV-negative YMSM of color in their social networks. This pilot randomized controlled trial will evaluate OPPEN's acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effect on PrEP care engagement among YMSM of color. San Diego, California [Practice Facilitation as a Strategy to Improve Alcohol Treatment Adoption and Implementation in HIV Care](https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT05241990) open to eligible people ages 18 years and up Despite availability of evidence-based alcohol reduction interventions (EBI), unhealthy alcohol use remains a barrier to HIV medication adherence, viral suppression and retention in HIV care and consequently HIV treatment as prevention (TASP). Guided by complementary implementation and evaluation frameworks-the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance), The investigators will conduct a Hybrid Type 3 effectiveness-implementation evaluating implementation trial testing whether practice facilitation, an evidence-based multifaceted implementation strategy increases reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of stepped care for unhealthy alcohol use in three Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) HIV clinics located in Boston, San Diego, and Chapel Hill. The investigators will secondarily test whether practice facilitation is associated with decreased unhealthy alcohol use, and improved Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) adherence and viral suppression at the patient level. In practice facilitation, a practice coach will offer tools, resources, hands-on guidance, and content expertise to assist sites in offering a stepped care model of alcohol treatment to patients with unhealthy alcohol use. Stepped care will include brief intervention, cognitive behavioral therapy, and alcohol pharmacotherapy. The practice facilitation intervention will be rolled out sequentially across sites. There will be three phases at each site: pre-implementation planning, implementation with formative evaluation, and post-implementation summative evaluation. Using mixed methods, The investigators specifically propose to meet the following specific aims: (Aim 1) Tailor the practice facilitation intervention to each site using mixed methods (pre-implementation); (Aim 2a) Determine the effects of practice facilitation on implementation of stepped care (primary) and alcohol use and HIV-related outcomes (secondary) using interrupted time series analysis with synthetic controls (summative evaluation); (Aim 2b) Determine the effect of practice facilitation on reach, adoption, and maintenance of evidence-based alcohol treatment using mixed methods (formative evaluation); and (Aim 3) Describe barriers and facilitators to implementation of alcohol-related interventions at each site to describe maintenance and inform widespread sustainable implementation.

San Diego, California and other locations [Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in HIV Database](https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT05023044) open to eligible people ages 18 years and up Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of liver conditions associated with fat accumulation that ranges from benign, non-progressive liver fat accumulation to severe liver injury, cirrhosis, and liver failure. The spectrum of NAFLD encompasses steatosis (nonalcoholic fatty liver [NAFL]) and steatohepatitis (NASH) there is evidence of hepatocellular injury and/or fibrosis. NAFLD is the most common liver disease in adults and the second leading cause for liver transplantation in the U.S. The natural history of NAFLD in the general population has been well described. The NASH Clinical Research Network (NASH CRN) was established by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) in 2002 to further the understanding of the diagnosis, mechanisms, progression and therapies of NASH. This effort has resulted in numerous seminal studies in the field. However, NASH CRN studies have systematically excluded persons living with HIV (PLWH) , as NAFLD in PLWH was thought to be different from that in the general population due to HIV infection, antiretroviral therapy (ART), concomitant medications and co-infections. This resulted in major knowledge gaps regarding NAFLD in the setting of HIV infection. Thus, the natural history of NAFLD in PLWH is largely unknown. The goal of this ancillary study of NAFLD and NASH in Adults with HIV (HIV NASH CRN), is to conduct a prospective, observational, multicenter study of NAFLD in PLWH (HIV-associated NAFLD). San Diego, and other locations [Prevalence and Predictors of Hepatic Steatosis in Persons Living With HIV](https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT04795219) open to eligible people ages 18-80 Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of liver conditions associated with fat accumulation that ranges from benign, non-progressive liver fat accumulation to severe liver injury, cirrhosis, and liver failure. NAFLD is the most common liver disease in US adults and the second leading cause for liver transplantation in the US. The natural history of NAFLD in the general population has been well described, with those with non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL, or simple steatosis) destined to have rare incidence of hepatic events compared to those with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), who are at high risk for future development of cirrhosis, liver cancer and liver failure. The NASH Clinical Research Network (NASH CRN) was established by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) in 2002, through the mechanism of RFA-DK-01-025, to further the understanding of diagnosis, mechanisms, progression and therapies of NASH. The NASH CRN effort has resulted in numerous seminal studies in the field. However, NASH CRN studies have systematically excluded persons living with HIV (PLWH), as NAFLD in these persons was thought to be different from that in the general population due to HIV, ART, concomitant medications, and co-infections. This has resulted in major knowledge gaps regarding NAFLD in the setting of HIV. This ancillary study of NAFLD and NASH in Adults with HIV (HIV NASH CRN), HNC 001 goal is to examine the prevalence of hepatic steatosis and NAFLD in a large, multicenter, and multiethnic cohort of PLWH (Steatosis in HIV Study) La Jolla, California and other locations [Use of a Screening Tool to Describe HIV-Related Cancer Burden and Patient Characteristics in the AMC](https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT05510908) open to eligible people ages 18 years and up This study is being done to understand how many people with HIV (PWH) present for cancer care across the AIDS Malignancy Consortium in the United States and if there are reasons that some PWH choose to participate, or not in cancer clinical trials. Optional quality of life surveys will be used to learn more about how HIV and cancer and HIV and cancer treatment affect people. La Jolla, California and other locations [A Clinical Trial of Combination HIV-Specific Broadly Neutralizing Monoclonal Antibodies Combined With ART Initiation During Acute HIV Infection to Induce HIV Remission](https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT05719441) Sorry, not yet accepting patients A5388 is a phase II, two-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that will enroll 48 antiretroviral therapy (ART)-na\u00efve adults with acute HIV infection (AHI) in order to determine whether: - Administration of combination HIV-specific broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) therapy in addition to ART during acute HIV infection (AHI) will be safe. - Participants who receive combination bNAb therapy in addition to ART during AHI will be more likely to demonstrate a delay in time to HIV-1 RNA 1,000 copies/mL for 4 consecutive weeks compared to participants who receive placebo plus ART. - Participants who receive combination bNAb therapy in addition to ART during AHI will demonstrate lower viral reservoirs and enhanced HIV-specific immunity compared to participants who receive placebo plus ART. San Diego, California and other locations [A Study to Evaluate the Anti-inflammatory Effects of Letermovir (Prevymis) in Adults With Human Immunodeficiency (HIV)-1 and Asymptomatic Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Who Are on Suppressive Antiretroviral Therapy, Plus Its Effect on Chronic Inflammation, HIV Persistence and Other Clinical Outcomes.](https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT04840199) Sorry, not currently recruiting here This is an open-label, controlled study, conducted at US sites to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effectiveness of the study drug letermovir in adults with HIV and asymptomatic cytomegalovirus (CMV) who are on antiretroviral therapy (ART)-mediated suppression.

San Diego, California and other locations [Brentuximab Vedotin and Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Stage II-IV HIV-Associated Hodgkin Lymphoma](https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT01771107) Sorry, in progress, not accepting new patients This pilot phase I/II trial studies the side effects and the best dose of brentuximab vedotin when given together with combination chemotherapy and to see how well they work in treating patients with stage II-IV human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated Hodgkin lymphoma. Brentuximab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody, called brentuximab, linked to a chemotherapy drug called vedotin. Brentuximab attaches to CD30-positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers vedotin to kill them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride, vinblastine sulfate, and dacarbazine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving brentuximab vedotin together with combination chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells. La Jolla, California and other locations [DHFS for Medication Adherence Support During Hospital Admissions for Person Living With HIV](https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT04418037) Sorry, in progress, not accepting new patients This study is a prospective single arm open label intervention study over 16 weeks using the DHFS and a telemedicine platform with persons living with HIV who are not virologically suppressed, admitted to UCSD Hillcrest Medical Center and initiating or restarting anti-retroviral therapy (ARVs). This proof of concept study will investigate the feasibility of using the DHFS in hospitalized individuals living with HIV to support ARV adherence. The Study intervention has an initiation phase of 2 weeks, a persistence phase of 14 weeks and a follow-up phase out to 48 weeks. Once study consent is obtained, the participant will receive a focused case navigation, psychiatric and substance abuse evaluation and will initiate digitized ARVs, either in hospital or at the AVRC within 14 days of hospital discharge, in collaboration with their providers. The study intervention will be considered to start from the point at which the DHFS is started. The study team will ensure the participants continue to utilize the DHFS both in hospital and after discharge. Following the 16 week intervention the study team will continue to follow participants to evaluate retention in care and viral suppression up to 48 weeks in collaboration with the outpatient care providers. San Diego, California [Digital Health Feedback System (DHFS) for Longitudinal Monitoring of ARVs Used in HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)](https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT03693040) Sorry, in progress, not accepting new patients This study uses an ingestion sensor and a wearable sensor (worn as a patch on the skin), which are new Proteus Digital Health (PDH) technologies approved by the FDA, to collect information about patients taking their Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) medication for HIV prevention. The wearable sensor records information, which is uploaded wirelessly to a mobile device and then to a secure computer. Together the sensors and the mobile device transmitting the information to the study computer are called a digital health feedback system (DHFS), which gives healthcare providers information about when patients have taken their PrEP medication. The purpose of the study is to demonstrate that the DHFS is easy to use and acceptable to people taking PrEP; that patients will persist with its use; and that the system provides valid, accurate measures of adherence.

Subjects who have previously taken F/TDF as PrEP will continue with a fixed dose combination of daily oral F/TAF substituting for F/TDF. Subjects will receive the iTAB text messaging adherence reminders to provide personalized, automated text messages to support and monitor adherence that will vary by participant choice until 12 weeks after switching medication. This study will enroll 60 individuals to take F/TAF as PrEP for 48 weeks. San Diego, California [Estradiol Therapy In Transgender Women to Research Interactions With HIV Therapy](https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT06005610) Sorry, not yet accepting patients Transgender women (TW) are a key population and priority for HIV treatment. More research is needed to develop evidence-based clinical guidance when it comes to choosing antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimens for TW on feminizing hormonal therapy (FHT). Concerns about ART interacting with FHT and decreasing its effectiveness can lead to decreased ART adherence and increased viral loads. The GET IT RiGHT trial aims to address concerns about drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between ART and FHT while providing access to hormonal therapy to TW living with HIV. Data suggest that access to FHT improves adherence to HIV treatment and decreases treatment interruptions. This is an open-label, non-randomized, 3-group trial of adult TW and other individuals identifying as female or transfeminine but with male sex assigned at birth living with HIV. Participants will be on ART at entry and receive study-supplied 17- estradiol for FHT for 48 weeks. The primary objectives of the study are to 1) assess whether TW continue to achieve therapeutic concentrations of ART while receiving FHT for 48 weeks and 2) assess whether serum estradiol concentrations on FHT (across a range of estradiol doses) vary between boosted and un-boosted ART regimens.

However, HIV is still a chronic disease and there are remaining barriers to achieving ideal health status and quality of life. One barrier may be a condition that is common among PLWH, called alexithymia, which can make it difficult for a person to name and describe the emotions that they are feeling. As a result, it is difficult to resolve negative emotional states, which can then lead to worse outcomes over time due to ongoing stress and related problems such as inflammation. In this study we will try to find out whether taking cannabidiol (CBD) helps PLWH who have alexithymia to resolve those negative emotional states, which may then reduce inflammation in the body as a result. CBD may work by enhancing the body's own chemical messengers that can help to regulate emotions and encourage emotional benefits. We will compare a group of people who take CBD for 4 weeks to those who take a placebo, which is a substance that will closely resemble the CBD but will not contain any active drug. Study participants and the researchers who are working directly with the participants will not be able to tell which is the CBD and which is the placebo. We will evaluate participants before and after the 4-week study period. We will also collect samples, such as blood, so that we can measure inflammation. We will compare the two groups to see if those who took CBD have lower alexithymia and lower inflammation compared to those who took the placebo. The potential benefit of this study is that CBD may be an effective treatment for alexithymia in PLWH, which may then improve both their emotional and physical health outcomes. This can help to address a remaining barrier to good medical outcomes for PLWH.

The investigators hope to learn and understand how MHV can improve the self-management of chronic conditions like HIV. First, the investigators will review Veteran medical records to look at the relationship between use of MHV and whether it has a positive or negative impact on the Veteran's management of HIV. Next, the investigators will interview participants to find out how MHV for self-management is used by Veterans and to find out why Veterans and providers choose to use (or not use) specific MHV tools. Lastly, the investigators will use the information found from the first two steps and create an intervention that will encourage non-MHV users to use the MHV tools that can help achieve health-related goals. Once the intervention has been developed, Veterans and providers will participate in a \"cognitive walkthrough\" to help the researchers test the intervention to see if it is usable, possible, and acceptable.

The first is to assess if providing HIV treatment on the first visit (or within 1 week) can help people re-engage with care and ultimately stay in care after 24 and 48 weeks. It will also assess the success of starting treatment immediately by measuring the HIV virus in people's bloodstream after 24 and 48 weeks. The second part of this study is to assess a new behavioral treatment called 60-Minutes-for-Health which aims to help people identify and overcome barriers to HIV care, to help with motivation maintaining in care, to help cope with negative feelings about HIV, and to help increase self-reliance in seeking healthcare amid other things that are happening in your life.

Although severe forms of AIDS-related dementia have diminished, milder forms of cognitive impairment have been noted among approximately 30% of asymptomatic HIV patients. Studies among HIV-infected U.S. military personnel regarding neurocognitive function have largely been limited to the early 1990s, before the advent of HAART. In these studies subtle neurobehavioral changes were noted among asymptomatic HIV-positive military personnel. This study proposes to determine the prevalence of neurocognitive deficits among HIV-positive military beneficiaries during the era of HAART who are participants of the U.S. Military HIV Natural History Study. The prevalence ascertained in this study will be compared to HIV-negative military beneficiaries who are demographically similar to the HIV positive group. The sample size of the study is to have complete testing on 200 HIV positive and 50 HIV-negative participants; due to the possibility of attrition before study completion, the investigators will enroll up to 300 participants (240 HIV-positive and 60 HIV-negative) to achieve this sample size. The investigators' rates among HIV-positive patients found in this study will also be contextualized in the setting of the prevalence of prior neurocognitive deficits seen in a HIV positive U.S. military population studied in the 1990s, contemporary rates among civilian HIV-infected persons, and normative values in the general HIV-negative population. Compared to other data in the field of neuropsychology, this study is novel in that the HIV population studied is composed largely of HIV patients who have been diagnosed early in their HIV infection; have open, free access to antiretrovirals to begin therapy earlier than most other cohorts; and consists of highly-functioning, educated individuals.
