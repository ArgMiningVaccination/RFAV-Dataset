Or just take your skin from good to great? Here's our review trialing HUM's incredibly-well reviewed skincare supplement...", "sitename": "The Chalkboard", "date": "2021-04-20", "cleaned_text": "My skin can be a bit confusing. While most would define it as \"good\" skin, it's awfully sensitive too. Therefore, I'm religious about washing it nightly and you'll never catch me falling asleep in makeup (no matter how many margaritas have preceded). I take great care of my skin and gut - fermented foods, lots of water, you know the drill. So when first saw [HUM's Daily Cleanse supplement](https://www.sephora.com/product/daily-cleanse-supplements-P386754) at Sephora, even after reading all the great reviews and seeing the before and after photos (below), I thought, what difference could this really make. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. The Supplement That Saved My Skin Daily Cleanse is [a vegan supplement](https://www.sephora.com/product/daily-cleanse-supplements-P386754) consisting of [14 powerful clean, clinically proven ingredients](https://www.sephora.com/product/daily-cleanse-supplements-P386754) formulated to help clear the skin and body from toxins. It's loaded with vitamins and minerals that aid in digestion, detoxify from within, and soothe acne-prone skin. [Results shown: HUM Nutrition consumer](https://www.sephora.com/product/daily-cleanse-supplements-P386754) My Initial Thoughts... I took my first dose of [Daily Cleanse](https://www.sephora.com/product/daily-cleanse-supplements-P386754) after an exceptionally fun weekend out of town with friends. I figured, if ever a time to detox my skin (and liver), this was it. My post-weekend skin feeling defeated and my gut overload on salty treats from evenings past, I eagerly popped two capsules with my morning coffee. I loved that I could take [Daily Cleanse](https://www.sephora.com/product/daily-cleanse-supplements-P386754) on an empty stomach or with food. As someone who can never commit to taking vitamins, I was also pleased to discover that these supplements were both flavorless and easy to swallow, leaving no excuse for not taking them regularly. Each bottle at Sephora is [$26](https://www.sephora.com/product/daily-cleanse-supplements-P386754) and contains a full month worth of supplements (60 vegan capsules) Right off the bat, compared to so many 'beauty supplements' out there, I loved that [Daily Cleanse](https://www.sephora.com/product/daily-cleanse-supplements-P386754) provides great value. I've actually already recommended them to several friends who want to trial supplements without spending their entire stimulus check. Bonus: they come in adorable bottles (made from 100% ocean-bound plastic) so I didn't feel the need to hide them in the back of my medicine cabinet, like so many other supplements. In fact, I've since kept mine next to my coffee machine to get in the habit of taking them daily. And Then This Happened... Cute packaging and convenience aside, Daily Cleanse is actually backed by science and it shows. Within the first few days of taking it consistently, I noticed my skin slightly purging. At first, I was kind of freaked out thinking I was breaking out. But after a quick Google search, I was happy to learn that this was a normal reaction to my skin responding to change. Daily Cleanse's unique blend includes chlorella, spirulina, and zinc - [ a powerful trio](https://www.sephora.com/product/daily-cleanse-supplements-P386754) that helps remove heavy metals from the body. Add that with milk thistle extract, a plant that is used to detoxify the body, and dandelion root (commonly used in herbal medicine to aid in liver and digestive health) and you've got a supplement loaded with ingredients that promotes cell regeneration and detoxification of heavy metals. It's no wonder that 82% of people who used Daily Cleanse [reported improved skin after just six weeks.](https://www.sephora.com/product/daily-cleanse-supplements-P386754) Aside from some minor, yet appreciated, changes in my skin clarity, I was also surprised at the effect [Daily Cleanse](https://www.sephora.com/product/daily-cleanse-supplements-P386754) had on my digestion. Again, in some ways I recognize I'm not an optimal case study as someone who does not suffer from major digestive issues, but any improvement is good improvement when it comes to digestive health, right? Here's What I Think... If you're prone to adult acne or poor digestion, [Daily Cleanse](https://www.sephora.com/product/daily-cleanse-supplements-P386754) just may be your saving grace. And if you have the good fortune of having well-behaved skin, you may still be surprised to see results \u2014 it's a small, convenient step you can take to help with your overall well-being. If you are going to try it, I recommend that you remain consistent with taking [two capsules once a day](https://www.sephora.com/product/daily-cleanse-supplements-P386754) for optimal results. Like anything, consistency is key and you most likely won't see results overnight. It took me a few days and I've read reviews that others noticed a drastic change over the span of a week. There may be no quick fix or \"magic pill\" for meaningful change, but [Daily Cleanse](https://www.sephora.com/product/daily-cleanse-supplements-P386754) is about as close to magic as it comes.
