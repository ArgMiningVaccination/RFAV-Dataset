The word 'homeopathy' (also known as homoeopathy) is derived from the Greek words homoios, meaning 'similar', and pathos meaning 'suffering'. Homeopaths treat patients with specially prepared substances that mimic the symptoms of those diseases in healthy people. The cornerstone of homeopathic philosophy is the 'law of similars'. This law or principle is based on a long-held belief that substances that produce symptoms in a healthy individual can be used to treat similar symptoms in a sick person. Modern homeopathy was founded in the 18th century by a German physician, Dr Samuel Hahnemann. An example of this principle is coffee. Coffee can aggravate some people who are sensitive to its stimulating effects. These people may experience increased mental and physical alertness, along with an exaggerated response to stimuli. People who present at a homeopathic clinic with symptoms of insomnia, headache, irritability and an over stimulated nervous system may be prescribed a dose of Coffea cruda, prepared according to homeopathic principles. Practitioners believe that this will settle the symptoms of insomnia in such people. Homeopathy aims to treat the whole person, taking into account personality, lifestyle and hereditary factors as well as the history of the disease. Homeopathy claims to treat the symptoms of a wide range of chronic and acute illnesses including, for example: The preparation of homeopathic medicines consists of repeated dilution and shaking called 'potentisation'. Homeopaths believe this process renders the remedies capable of stimulating the body's natural healing forces. After the 12th dilution, there is no discernible chemical trace of the original substance left in the medicine. Homeopathic medicines can be in the form of liquid, granules, powder or tablets. Your practitioner might also advise general lifestyle and dietary changes as part of a treatment plan. Sometimes symptoms may temporarily get worse before they get better. This 'aggravation' of symptoms can be part of the homeopathic treatment. However, you should tell your physician if you have these reactions. Because we create an individualized treatment plan, we may use homeopathy along with nutritional supplementation, hormone and neurotransmitter supplementation to achieve results.
