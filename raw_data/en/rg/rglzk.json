This publication was supported in whole or in part by the Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health, Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Agency (SAPTA) through State General Funds, and SAPT Block and Partnership for Success federal grants from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Its contents are solely the responsibility of the authors and do not necessa rily represent the official views of the U.S. DHHS, SAMHSA, or the State of Nevada. NyECC plans and organizes its substance misuse prevention activities in accordance with the Strategic Prevention Framework (see page 5 ) and by addressing specific risk and protective factors (see page 8 ). Sections are organized according to the steps in the Str ategic Prevention Framework: 1. Assessment . What are the current needs in the service area? Does the data reveal any emerging trends? What cultural or geographic aspects of the service area might impact substance use or mental wellness? 2. Capacity . How well prepared is NYECC to address these needs? What resources exist in the service area to address these needs? What's missing? 3. Planning . What needs have been prioritized by NYECC? Who will their partners be in addressing these priorities? What activi ties and strategies will be utilized? What do they hope to accomplish? 4. Implementation . What is NYECC already doing to address needs in the community? Are their efforts rooted in solid research? 5. Evaluation . How well has NYECC performed in the past? How well have NYECC's subrecipients performed? What might they wish to improve upon? As a result of this CCPP process, NyECC has chosen to focus their efforts on the following Priorities over the next three years: 1. Reduce Access to Alcohol, Tobacco, Mari juana, Methamphetamines, and Opioids 2. Intervention for Substance Misuse 3. Support Mental Wellness Nye Communities Coalition Comprehensive Community Prevention Plan 2021 -2024 Page 5 4. Support Educational Attainment 5. Reduce Isolation 6. Promote Physical Wellness This CCPP is being written during the midst of the COVID -19 pandemic. Social scientists have documented the impact of natural disasters on domestic violence, both between adult partners and against children. Many experts believe factors related to COVID -19 (lack of contact with outside entities, increased stress, etc.) will mimic the impacts of natural disasters and will result in increased rates of domestic violence (Source: Campbell). In addition, several studies have linked COVID -19 quarantine orders wit h increased substance misuse (CDC, National Institute on Drug Abuse, etc.). Experts cite community collaborations with agencies, such as NyECC, as key to mitigating the impacts on children and families. It is especially timely for NyECC to re -visit their priorities and evaluate their efforts. Readers may wish to review the \"About the Data\" section in Appendix A to familiarize themselves with the various sources cited throughout this document. Strategic Prevention Framework NyECC utilizes the Strategic Pre vention Framework to plan and deliver services. This framework, which was developed by the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, was designed to help community coalitions guide their activities to m aximize their impact on substance misuse, use and misuse. Nye Communities Coalition Comprehensive Community Prevention Plan 2021 -2024 Page 6 NYECC's successful history addressing the opioid epidemic will explain how this process works for NYECC: Assessment. NyECC identified the current problems with the help of local doctors and the EMS Director. This assessment included looking at the numbers of people impacted by opioid misuse along with an examination of the environment and norms within the community. Capac ity. Nevada was on the leading edge of the opioid epidemic. There were not many resources specific to opioid prevention or treatment. NyECC's response required various community members and agencies to pull together. NyECC formed a subgroup to address the opiate crisis that included medical doctors, emergency services, and Coalition staff. Medical doctors noted where they had leverage and resources, EMS noted their resources, and NyECC had general prevention funding to help. As the opioid crisis spread, add itional funding became available. Planning. NyECC staff and coalition membership utilized their prevention, health, and wellness knowledge, along with the best practice resources available, to begin to Assessment Page 12 Capacity Page 23 Planning Page 36Implementation Page 43Evaluation Page 46Nye Communities Coalition Comprehensive Community Prevention Plan 2021 -2024 Page 7 implement changes. Access was identified as an init ial point where the Coalition could make a difference. Medical doctors were especially focused on ensuring that everyone was aware that as prescription drugs were removed from the community there would most likely be an increase in heroin and other opiate use. This knowledge helped the Coalition plan for long -term prevention related to opiates. Implementation . Medical doctors were able to implement policy changes at all but one medical office in Pahrump, which required them to join forces across competitiv e medical groups. They also began enforcing limits on the writing of prescription opiates. NyECC helped educate the community about this policy change and provided up-to-date resources and information about interventions and treatment options. Efforts in this area have continued to evolve and grow as the opioid crisis has continued and has evolved to include other opiate based substances. The opioid subgroup continued to meet monthly until the COVID -19 pandemic began. The subgroup examined relevant data a nd adjusted to changing norms. The same medical doctors who initially identified the local opioid crisis began integrating MAT treatment. The Coalition and its partners continue to educate the community and reduce access through programs such as This is NO T about Drugs (TINAD), Drug Take Backs, and media campaigns. Evaluation . The opioid crisis has evolved from various prescription medications to heroin (Loratabs to Fentanyl to heroin, for example). In addition, baseline data for youth and adult misuse di d not exist like it does for other substances (e.g., marijuana or alcohol). A final confounding factor stems from the State's various efforts to ask these questions appropriately on the YRBS. Initial efforts were too vague (e.g., \"Have you ever used a pres cription drug without a doctor's prescription\") which may have led to youth answering \"yes\" if they had used someone else's antibiotics. The question is now worded \"Have you Used Prescription Drugs/Pain Killers to Get High.\" All of this has exacerbated NyE CC's efforts to evaluate the full impact of its prevention activities. It should be noted that the Strategic Prevention Framework is compatible with the Collective Impact Process NyECC uses to guide all Coalition Activities, as follows: Nye Communities Coalition Comprehensive Community Prevention Plan 2021 -2024 Page 8 NyECC utilizes the principles of Collective Impact to dig deeper into Coalition activities, ensuring the effectiveness of the collaboration of the partnerships in Nye, Esmeralda, and Lincoln Counties. Risk and Protective Factors/Developmental Assets and Defic its People typically have instinctive ideas or theories about what factors encourage or discourage substance misuse. While these ideas are not necessarily wrong, scientific research shows that certain risk factors present in a young person's life increase the possibility of becoming involved in problem behaviors. Using these research -based risk and protective factors provides a common language and understanding for prevention professionals. There is a direct correlation between the number of risk factors p resent for a young person and the likelihood that he or she will participate in negative behaviors. NyECC utilizes the following matrices of Risk and Protective Factors from the National Institutes of Health to organize information and set priorities for youth. Collective Impact Strategic Prevention Framework Nye Communities Coalition Comprehensive Community Prevention Plan 2021 -2024 Page 9 Risk Factors Definition Adolescent Substance Use Young Adult Substance Use Individual/Peer Early initiation of substance use Engaging in alcohol or drug use at a young age. Early and persistent problem behavior Emotional distress, aggressiveness, and \"difficult\" temperaments in adolescents Rebelliousness High tolerance for deviance and rebellious activities. Favorable attitudes toward substance use Positive feelings towards alcohol or drug use, low perception of risk. Peer substance use Friends and peers who engage in alcohol or drug use. Genetic predictors Genetic susceptibility to alcohol or drug use. Family Family management problems (monitoring, rewards, etc.) Poor management practices, including parents' failure to set clear expectations for children's behavior, failure to supervise and monitor children, and excessively severe, harsh, or inconsistent punishment. Family conflict Conflict between parents or between parents and children, including abuse or neglect. Favorable parental attitudes Parental attitudes that are favorable to drug use and parental approval of drinking and drug use. Family history of substa nce misuse Persistent, progressive, and generalized substance use, misuse, and use disorders by family members. Nye Communities Coalition Comprehensive Community Prevention Plan 2021 -2024 Page 10 School Academic failure beginning in late elementary school Poor grades in school. Lack of commitment to school When a young person no longer considers the role of the student as meaningful and rewarding, or lacks investment or commitment to school Community Low cost of alcohol Low alcohol sales tax, happy hour specials, and other price discounting. High availability of substances High number of alcohol outlets in a defined geographical area or per a sector of the population. Community laws and norms favorable to substance use Community reinforcement of norms suggesting alcohol and drug use is accepta ble for youth, including low tax rates on alcohol or tobacco or community beer tasting events. Media portrayal of alcohol use Exposure to actors using alcohol in movies or television. Low neighborhood attachment Low level of bonding to the neighborhood. Community disorganization Living in neighborhoods with high population density, lack of natural surveillance of public places, physical deterioration, and high rates of adult crime. Low socioeconomic status A parent's low socioeconomic status, as measured through a combination of education, income, and occupation. Transitions and mobility Communities with high rates of mobility within or between communities.

These sources are more fully described and explored in Appendix A. In addition to those sources, NyECC formally reviews relevant, timely quantitative data from the State of Nevada, local law enforcement, and other community partners related to emerging trends and needs. NyECC gathers input from community members in a variety of ways. Often this occurs during the grant writing process. In that case the CEO communicates with stakeholders specific to a certain topic for input while writing the grant. They will often refer her to other individuals who hold specific knowledge about the topic. In other cases NyECC YACC Youth Team (sponsored by NyECC) participating in a bonding and communication exercise. Nye Communities Coalition Comprehensive Community Prevention Plan 2021 -2024 Page 13 staff and leadership will notice a pattern of re sponses about a topic, or a topic being discussed with particular vehemence. When this is noted, NyECC leadership and staff are trained to \"listen with big ears\" to determine the relevancy and validity of an issue and start to formulate potential solutions . As a third method of needs assessment, NyECC utilized the CDC's \"Calculating for an Adequate System Tool\" (Source: Nevada Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Agency, Regional Capacity Assessment Report: Southern Rural Region 2019) to determine the estimated need for prevention services throughout the service area. The table below shows the \"adjusted community need\" and the \"estimated need\" (over or under) of each type of prevention activity. Activities that may need to be increased are highlighted in blue. It is important to note that this assessment includes Nye and Esmeralda Counties only. In addition, it is also important to understand that these services are not equally distributed from one community to another. For example, the Town of Pahrump may have an adequate number of school programs but the Town of Tonopah may not.

In terms of their internal structures and systems capacity to address substance misuse prevention: NyECC requires new employees to complete a comprehensive Ne w Hire Orientation process. In addition to typical human resources -related activities (e.g., payroll and travel policies), new hires are expected to attend coalition meetings, complete Mental Health First Aid and related programs, participate in team build ing exercises, etc. Completion of these tasks is tracked using a New Hire Orientation Form. They are then required to participate in trainings related to their specific division or area of responsibility. In the case of substance misuse prevention, employe es are required to attend a minimum of 20 -40 hours (depending on part -time or full -time status) trainings per year. Trainings are selected by the most relevant to needs identified in the community. The following table identifies the trainings NyECC staff h ave recently attended: Substance Misuse/Mental Wellness Trainings for NYECC STAFF From 2019 -Present Type of Training Mental Health First Aide* Youth Mental Health First Aide* Psychological First Aide* SAFETalk* About Drugs)* Crisis Intervention* SAPST (Substance Abuse Prevention Specialist Training) Servant Leadership Rural Equity Confidentiality Cannabis Policies Cannabis and Vaping Prevention Ethics Collective Impact Opioid Awareness* Diabetes Self -Management* Suicide Awareness WorkKeys Nye Communities Coalition Comprehensive Community Prevention Plan 2021 -2024 Page 24 Bingocize* Nutrition* Pain Management* Chronic Disease Self -Management* Managing Remote Employees Tall Cop Alcohol Awareness Civil Rights Awareness Vape Pens and Trends* High In Plain Sight *Asterisks indicate trainings for which NyECC is qualified as \"trainer of trainers.\" They offer theses trainings to their staff and to the community at large, particularly law enforcement officers and school personnel. NyECC leadership is creating a tool to evaluate the effectiveness of its trainers. Volunteers are required to complete the same New Hire Orientation as new employees (see description above). They can then carry this prevention training throughout the rest of their sphere of influence . NyECC utilizes a \"Grant Manager Performance Measures\" document to track both fiscal and programmatic progress for each grant it is awarded. Grant Managers self -document their performance and then bring that data to their employee performance reviews. As a Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Subgrantee, NyECC supports job seekers and employers by arranging for a wide range of trainings ranging from CNA to internet security to truck driving. The following section analyzes the service area's capaci ty to address substance misuse and mental health (i.e., awareness of problems, readiness to change, confidence in ability to change, and an assessment of existing resources). Awareness of Problems NyECC conducted \"Environmental Scans\" in 2019. Adult respondents were well -aware of youth alcohol, marijuana, amphetamine use and offered support for educational campaigns.

YACC Youth Team's Drug Paraphernalia Education Trailer (DPET) has been well - received in the community. YACC Youth Team #Our Epidemic (21 tobacco impact video) presentation to the Nevada State Legislature. Youth and law enforcement collaborate for Alcohol Sales Compliance Checks. NyECC has supported several youth (now adults) through various internships, volunteer activities, and work experiences who are now well -versed in prevention and working elsewhere in the community. People l iving in the smaller communities in the service area (e.g., Tonopah and Lincoln County) are more tightknit and know one another, at least by name. They tend to live and work in the same geographic area. Pahrump's footprint is somewhat spread out and withou t a common \"city center.\" A large percentage are retired or work in Las Vegas. People tend to know the people they work with and the people they live next to, but not many others in the community. These are important differences when considering capacity a nd communication channels. Some barriers to capacity building throughout communities include limited Wi - Fi access and transportation. 4.023.753.8 1 2 3 4 5History of CollaborationCollaborative Group Seen as Legitimate Leader in CommunityFavorable Political and Social ClimateWilder Collaboration Factors Inventory Category 1: ENVIRONMENT Comprehensive Score: 3.85Nye Communities Coalition Comprehensive Community Prevention Plan 2021 -2024 Page 28 NyECC provides training locally and/or supports community members' travel to attend various substance misuse/mental well ness trainings, as follows: Substance Misuse/Mental Wellness Trainings for COMMUNITY MEMBERS From 2019 -Present Community Anti -Drug Coalitions of America RX Summit Stimulant Summit San Diego Marijuana Summit Agents of Change Media Training Utah Substance Abuse Summit Mental Health First Aid, with Opioid Prevention Crisis Intervention Training Mental Health First Aid Certification ASSIST SafeTALK Youth to Youth International Leadership Conference Psychological First Aid Over the years NyECC has provided hundreds of community members with similar trainings. These trainings provide community members in multiple community sectors with the information, resources, and guidance they need to work toward preventing substance misu se and/or improve mental wellness in their individual sphere of influence. Family Conditions There is no indication that families are generally unaware or in denial about problems related to substance misuse or mental health issues. Different communities within the service area demonstrate different levels of awareness and acceptance of these prob lems. In general, the smaller the town, and the less transiency, the more Cannabis use is high among the youth population I work with. The parents usually don't see that as a problem. They are worried about other drugs, but not cannabis. They have no c oncept of the impact on the young person's developing mind. -Healthcare Provider Nye Communities Coalition Comprehensive Community Prevention Plan 2021 -2024 Page 29 Several key informants expressed concerns about generational substance misuse leading to poverty, lack of supervision, a limited vision of the future, and ultimately, chil dren using substances themselves. This concern was most prevalent in Pahrump. Key informants expressed frustrations about parents/guardians who do not attend school or community functions or educational events. They believe that the parents who do attend are not typically the ones who should be there. School Conditions There was no indication that schools are unaware or in denial about substance misuse or mental health issues in the community. Schools in this service area struggle to recruit and retain teachers. They believ e this is due to a lack of other services in the communities (e.g., medical care) for themselves and their own families. This deficit impacts continuity not only with students but also any supplementary programs that NyECC may wish to implement at the scho ols. Preschool children working on their motor skills during a parent -child workshop using the DARE To Be You curriculum led by Community Chest, Inc. Community Chest, Inc. is a sub grantee of NyECC and is able to provide the program DARE To Be You using Substan ce Abuse Primary Prevention (SAPP) funding. Nye Communities Coalition Comprehensive Community Prevention Plan 2021 -2024 Page 30 The relatively small number of students and troubles with recruiting and retaining teachers has impacted school district's ability to offer advanced classes. Several key informants mentioned that students who go to college feel less prepared than the ir counterparts who attended schools in larger districts. Local schools and school districts have greatly increased their capacity to provide substance misuse prevention and wellness education to their students through their association with NyECC. The Ny e County School District is a subgrantee for SAPP grant and delivers prevention programming in the Pre -K. They also allow NyECC to deliver programming in the schools. The Lincoln County School District and NyECC are preparing to implement This Is Not About Drugs across all grades. NyECC delivers prevention and wellness lessons in before - and after -school programs. NyECC providing prevention programming for student athletes for years and then transferred that to the schools to deliver directly (NyECC still p rovides prevention education materials). NyECC also works with the schools to bring in presentations, including school -wide prevention and mental health awareness. Readiness to Change The Center for Community Health and Development at the University of Kansas provides a 9 -step framework for determining a community's \"level of readiness\" for change ranging from \"no awareness\" to \"professionalization.\" (Source: Center for Community Health). The following paragraphs provide some evidence for NyECC's Service Area's level of readiness. This assessment is structured using Drug -Free Communities' community sectors: Business Sector : o NyECC enjoys a very strong relationship with the business sector, primarily because of their workforce training programs. NyECC has established MOU's and contracts with businesses, they host job fairs, and they work daily with businesses across Nye and Esmerald a Counties. o NyECC employees serve on the Economic Development Boards for Nye and Esmeralda Counties. o Businesses partner with NyECC for their annual Back -to-School event and Red Ribbon week. Nye Communities Coalition Comprehensive Community Prevention Plan 2021 -2024 Page 31 o Businesses help reduce stigma and promote substance misuse pr evention by posting information about addiction and prevention for their employees and customers. o Pharmacies partner with NyECC by including information on prescription bags. o Local media outlets provide NyECC with free marketing access. Local Government Sector : o Representatives from local governmental are familiar with NyECC and their activities, particularly those related to workforce development. NyECC is a welcome partner. o NyECC collaborates with local go vernmental entities and routinely contributes to government processes and assessments. COVID -19 strengthened this relationship in Nye County as NyECC supported the County's vaccination distribution processes. Tribal Government Sector : o NyECC has collaborated with the Duckwater and Yomba tribes on various activities over the years, including substance misuse prevention, wellness, workforce, and safe irrigation water. Healthcare Sector : o Representatives from the healthcare sector are well -aware of NyECC's goals and objectives. They are willing to partner with NyECC in healthcare and prevention activities. o Healthcare partners lend their expertise to assist with substance misuse prevention and intervention. They have educated Coalition staff and helped with implementing policies to prevent access to prescription medications. Healthcare partners are key to the implementation of the annual Remote Area Medical event that includes dental, vision, medical, mental, and behavioral health services. Education Sector : o Schools, especially in the Pahrump area, view NyECC as a trusted and valuable partner. o NyECC funds large projects at schools, although some people involved with those projects aren't aware that NyECC is the funder. Nye Communities Coalition Comprehensive Community Prevention Plan 2021 -2024 Page 32 o The local school districts, especially Nye County School District are very strong partners with NyECC. The Nye County School Distri ct was a founding partner for NyECC and the Coalition leases an old elementary school campus in Pahrump. NyECC collaborates daily with the schools, delivering before - and after -school programming, implementing prevention and wellness programming in the sc hools, and contributing to plan and system development on a recurring basis. Youth Serving Organization Sector: o The youth serving sector view NyECC as a valuable and trusted partner. They are enthusiastic partners in prevention efforts and would like more specific guidance and education about how to prevent substance misuse. Law Enforcement Sector: o Law enforcement in this service area is well -aware of NyECC and has a strong relationship with them. Various entities are engaged in prevention activities, with or without NyECC's direct involvement (e.g., juvenile probation officers, s heriff offices, etc.). Interviewer: You mentioned that substance abuse is the biggest problem facing your community. Why do you think that is? School Representative: Well, there isn't much for the k ids to do out here. Idle hands and all that. We're in the rurals, what do you expect? Interviewer: OK... School Representative: You know what? That's a cop -out. I think it's probably a whole lot more complicated than that. We have all the same problems that they have in cities, just a little less of it because there are fewer of us. -Law Enforcement Nye Communities Coalition Comprehensive Community Prevention Plan 2021 -2024 Page 33 Faith Based Sector : o Representatives from the faith -based sector are generally aware of NyECC. Their role in direct services to people in need is somewhat removed from the realm of grant -making. While they are more familiar with aspects of substance misuse treatment, they woul d gladly accept support in implementing prevention activities in their sphere of influence. o Faith -based partners assist with the dissemination of information, especially in those churches that are functioning as food pantries. Volunteer/Civic Organizations: o Volunteer/Civic organizations throughout the service area are familiar with NyECC, part icularly with respect to food insecurity projects. They appear to be less familiar with any substance misuse prevention but would be open to learning more. Parent Sector: o Through the various services that are provided by NyECC , including car safety seat inspections, crib safety training, before / after school programming, and workforce programming, NyECC connects with parents through many avenues. During these connections, parents are provided a variety of resources and referr als to internal NyECC services or out to other social service support systems. o Perhaps because of the widespread geography, or the non -traditional work schedules (casinos/mines), or the disparity in incomes, there seems to be a dichotomy of parental inv olvement in children's lives. For example, some parents are happy to drive 200 miles to attend their child's 8th grade volleyball game while others leave their children for extended periods of time to fend for themselves. When NyECC hosts events for parent s, it is usually the super -involved parents who attend rather than the parents who might benefit from the information being presented. NyECC does not mean to suggest that other communities have some type of uniform parenting style. Rather, they believe the re are unique aspects of the service area that seem to exacerbate engaged or disengaged parenting styles. Nye Communities Coalition Comprehensive Community Prevention Plan 2021 -2024 Page 34 Youth Sector: o NyECC facilitates and active youth team, Youth Advocates Changing Communities (YACC). It has just undergone its first year of formal evaluation. o NyECC engages youth through various mechanisms, including the YACC team. NyECC provides youth workforce and teen pr egnancy prevention programming, both of which actively seek youth input and understanding in the decision -making process for the program. NyECC also routinely meets with the Youth Leadership Team in Tonopah \"Community Youth Advocating for Change\" (CYAC). NyECC funds programming at Nye and Lincoln County schools to coordinate mental health/suicide awareness programming that provides insight to the Coalition's efforts. YACC Youth Team Members exploring the International Car Forest of the Last Church hear Goldfield, NV, on their way to a leadership training. This is a small town. We definitely notice it when someone is struggling with drugs or alcohol. But what are you supposed to do? Call the police? If I see it, I can only assume the parents see it. If they are ok with it, I don't want to overstep. Sometimes I think maybe the parents are embarrassed to ask for help. -Focus Group Nye Communities Coalition Comprehensive Community Prevention Plan 2021 -2024 Page 35 Media Sector: o NyECC access local media throughout the service area to share prevention and wellness messaging. o Local media is a strong partner for NyECC. Print media provides weekly space in the local newspaper for NyECC to promote activities and prevention messaging. Television and radio stations regularly feature NyECC staff on shows and programing to increase awareness and provide information. Substance Abuse Treatment Organization Sector : o Several treatment providers partner with NyECC regularly. They assist during the annual Remote Area Medical event and provide training and information for the Coalition partnership. Providers attend Coalition meetings and provide data and information to th e membership to assist with understanding local substance misuse conditions. o The sole substance misuse treatment provider in Tonopah routinely attends NyECC Coalition meetings. After reviewing and comparing the basic levels of readiness for these various commun ity sectors, it was determined the general level of readiness is Stage 9: High Level of Community Ownership. (Source: Community Tool Box). Resource Assessment The goal of a resource assessment is to: 1) identify services existing within the community that are available to address needs; and 2) to find any gaps in services. NyECC has conducted various assessments of community partnerships, gaps and resources over the years to varying degrees of success/satisfaction. At this time they are choosing to impleme nt what they believe will be a more meaningful cross -sector 9. High level of community ownership. Detailed and sophisticated knowledge exists about prevalence, causes, and consequences. Effective evaluation guides new directions. The model is applied to other issues. Nye Communities Coalition Comprehensive Community Prevention Plan 2021 -2024 Page 36 partnership assessment, in accordance with Collective Impact guidelines, during the next year. Planning When NyECC is informed that they have successfully obtained grant funding, leadership, coordinators, and managers meet together to complete their \"Grant Management Procedures\" and \"Performance Measures\" planning tools. These planning documents match scopes of work a nd budgets with existing NyECC employees and procedures. In addition, specific tasks related to each grant are added to a \"Tasks\" document completed for each employee. In an effort to keep NyECC's activities in alignment with the agency's vision, mission and goals, the Board of Directors and NyECC staff meet annually to review every activity. They discuss successes and struggles related to each activity and use a filter of \"keep, quit, or give away\" to determine the future of an activity. If an activity i s no longer supported by the community, an activity is ineffective, or the underlying issue has been resolved, NyECC practices \"purposeful abandonment.\" NyECC and its Subrecipients strive to implement policies, practices, and programs that are listed as \"approved or evidence -based\" programs in the State of Nevada, SAPTA, Evidence -Based Practices, Programs, and Policies Manual (March 2021) and/or various national clearinghouses (e.g., CDC, SAMHSA, etc.). NyECC will use the following priorities and associa ted activities as a starting point in their activities. Specific activities and partners under each priority may change and shift as funding and partnerships ebb and flow. NyECC's plans to evaluate the impact of activities associated with these priorities are addressed in the Evaluation section below.

Nye Communities Coalition Comprehensive Community Prevention Plan 2021 -2024 Page 43 Implementation NyECC utilized a \"Planning and Implementation\" guide from their 2018 -2021 CCPP to connect priorities to data to expected outcomes to strategies and activities. For the next three years (2021 -2024) they will follow the priority graphics set forth in the planning section above. NyECC's Board of Directors reviews the Coalition's activities on a monthly basis and has an annual review of all coalition activities. This offers an opportunity for Board Members to provide insight as well as ensuring that the efforts of the Coalition are focused on the vision and mission and are consistent with Coalition values. NyECC implements multiple evidence -based substance misuse prevention and mental wellness programs throughout their service area. Current programs include: YACC Team Members working on a leadership development project. Nye Communities Coalition Comprehensive Community Prevention Plan 2021 -2024 Page 44 Name of Program Where Provided?

Nye Communities Coalition Comprehensive Community Prevention Plan 2021 -2024 Page 45 Fidelit y is monitored through the tools provided by the developer, by attending updated trainings, and oftentimes by trained staff sitting in on other staff's trainings. Two programs (YACC and Alcohol Compliance) are undergoing a formal evaluation at this time. Their evaluation plans include logic models that include problem statements; goals and objectives; intended activities and whether they are evidence -based; process measures; and, short - and long -term outcome measures. NyECC provides general substance misuse prevention and mental wellness training for staff and community members as needs arise in the community. One example is NARCAN. Some community events are led by youth: NyECC refrains from implementing activities without the collaboration of at least one partner agency. Examples of some of community collaborated events in the past three years include: Examples of NYECC Collaborative Activities 2020 -2021 Activity Partner/Se ctor Back -to-School Event Nye County School District Local Businesses Local Medical Providers Remote Area Medical National Health Providers Local Medical Providers Governmental Agencies Nye County School District Local colleges/universities Local Businesses Provider Directory Local Social Service Agencies Governmental Agencies Red Ribbon Week Nye County School District Esmeralda County School District Lincoln County School District Signs of Suicide Nye County School D istrict We did some presentations about vaping to other y outh in Tonopah. -YACC Youth Team Member Nye Communities Coalition Comprehensive Community Prevention Plan 2021 -2024 Page 46 Evaluation NyECC approach es evaluation from three directions. First, the Coalition itself has been evaluated (structures, leadership in the community, etc.) using the Collective Impact framework (Collective Impact). Findings are included in a separate document (\"Nye Communities Coal ition Evaluation and Learning Report 2021\"). The second approach to evaluation relates specifically to NyECC's alcohol, tobacco and other drug use prevention goals over the past three years. The results are included in NyECC's Evaluation of ATOD Preventio n Efforts Report 2018 -2021. The third approach to evaluation relates to two of NyECC's individual programs. In FY 2020/2021, NyECC chose to evaluate the impact of their Alcohol Compliance Check program and their Youth Advocates Changing Communities (YACC) Youth Team. The results of these program -specific evaluations will be included in Evaluation Reports that will be completed by Fall 2021. Other programs will be evaluated in future years. Other activities, such as small group education efforts, are not e valuated separately. Looking forward, NyECC will measure the impact of their current alcohol, tobacco and other drug use prevention activities as follows: Nye Communities Coalition Comprehensive Community Prevention Plan 2021 -2024 Page 47 ATOD Evaluation Plan 202 1-2024 Priority Process Measures (\"Did we do what we said we were going to do?\") Outcome Measures (\"Did what we do have an impact on our audience?\") In what ways did we add- ress equity with this goal?

The following is a brief description of their primary data sources: 1. Nevada Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS): Questions for the YRBS are determined at the State level and are not under the direct cont rol of NYECC. Schools and classrooms are randomly selected within each county to receive the YRBS. The YRBS is typically administered every other year to middle school (grades 6, 7, 8) and high school (9, 10, 11, 12) students. UNR chooses to report results of the YRBS by individual county or by groups of counties. This approach increases confidentiality and anonymity in the less populated counties. At the same time, however, this type of aggregation may obscure results for an individual county . Active vs. passive consent policies have changed from school district to school district and over time. This distinction can have a dramatic impact on response rates and can skew results, making comparisons imperfect . YRBS -High and Esmeralda) 2017 2019 YRBS - and Esmeralda) 2017 2019 n=130 n=149 2. Qualitative Research This researcher conducted two focus groups (Tonopah and Pahrump), attended (virtually) three coalition meetings (Tonopah, Pahrump, Lincoln County), conducted approximately 16 individual interviews with adults, and conducted six interviews with youth. (Note : A parental consent form is Nye Communities Coalition Comprehensive Community Prevention Plan 2021 -2024 Page 55 required for youth interviews). Because of the COVID -19 pandemic, these activities took place through video conferencing. They took place between June and September 2021. Interviewees and focus group participants were selected to represent various sectors in the communities (i.e. school district employees, parents, youth, law enforcement, faith based, etc.). Results from key informants and focus groups are indicated in conversation bubbles: Even though the comments themselves are from one individual, they are included in this report only if they reflect a pattern of responses by others. Unless otherwise indicated, none of these comments should be interpreted to reflect the opinion of just one respondent. 3. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a nationwide health - related telephone survey that collects data about U.S. residents regarding their health - related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services (Source : CDC). The State of Nevada, Department of Health and Human Services Office of Analytics, provided state and service area data for the purposes of this CCPP. 4.

The State of Nevada ranks 39th (out of the 50 states and DC) for excise tax rate for alcohol (Scarboro 2017)). In other words, there are 12 states where alcohol is taxed at a lower rate per gallon. In addit ion, Hines' state -by-state research revealed that of the two types of alcohol analyzed for each state, there were only nine instances (or 9%) where Nevada was not the least expensive (2018). The CDC's Prevention Status Report (2013) recommended that the St ate of Nevada increase taxes on state beer, wine, and distilled spirits to reduce harms associated with over -consumption.

We [YACC Team] used to host youth nights, which were awesome. We had to stop that with COVID. There isn't a lot for teens to do here. There are a lot of casinos and bars. So those were really great. I hope we can get back to hosting those . We've adapted to COVID as gracefully as we could. We're trying to come back.

Residents of Nye, Esmeralda, and Lincoln Counties are not likely to be exceptions to this trend and, in fact, some residents noted alcohol shortages in local stores. Everyone knows who the druggies are. It's just ignored. But when someone new starts using...I don't know...it's like deny, deny, deny. Maybe we could have a train ing about how to approach someone without being judgmental, like the mental health trainings. In those we're learning to say, 'hey, you seem like you are struggling. Are you thinking about hurting yourself?' Why can't we do that with alcohol or drugs? -Focus Group Alcohol use is accepted and expected in young people.

It's sometimes like a community of self -defined misfits who find ways to fit together. -Social Worker We seem to have a lot of older people, and then a lot of young fam ilies. We have pockets of poverty, and then we have wealthy retirees. There isn't much in between, probably because there aren't a lot of high paying jobs.

Nye Communities Coalition Comprehensive Community Prevention Plan 2021 -2024 Page 72 There is no time for the students to socialize with one another. The students are interacting with fewer teachers per day so may not be bonding with any particular teacher as they normally might. Students who participate in sports are losing the physical outlet, which may be impacting their mental health. The various nuances of the hybrid program may be undermining the basic ability of young people to learn, which might impact their academic achievements for years to come. Extreme isolation is negatively impacting mental health. NyECC made attempts to bridge these gaps and reduce the impacts of isolation on youth in its service area. In some cases, NyECC staff would drop off (or have youth pick up) materials then host a virtual meeting for youth to cook, have a hang out sessio n, or do some lighter programming. NyECC also held distance meetings in parks and open areas where participants stayed at least six feet apart.

Heather lives with her mother and father. Her father works for the Bureau of Land Management and her mother works for the City. Heather has a reputation as being a rebel. She has had trouble controlling impulsive behaviors since she pulled the fire alarm in first grade. Heather's friends are used to her coming up with crazy ideas, although they are not always sure they are good ideas. She got caught with alcohol a co uple years ago and is still on probation. Heather's parents are never quite sure how to respond to the trouble she gets into. Her mom tends to want to punish her (e.g. ground her to the house, take away her phone, and restrict internet access). Her dad t ends to say things like, \"kids will be kids,\" and thinks they should just let her figure things out on her own. Her dad sometimes works out in the field for days at a time. Her mom is usually in charge of discipline, but they frequently fight. From their p erspectives, Heather's parents really just wish someone would tell them what to do. Neither of them feels confident in their parenting decisions. One thing Heather's parents agree on is that she should not be using alcohol or any other drugs. They tell her she should wait to use alcohol or marijuana until she turns 21, but when her dad is with his old friends, they talk about all their parties in hi gh school. Heather's mom decorated their kitchen with wine d\u00e9cor. There are signs that say things like, \"wine a little, laugh a lot,\" hanging on the walls. Heather is confused why her parents are trying to keep her from something that they obviously think is good. On one hand, Heather enjoys her reputation as a rebel and the fact that she is never really disciplined by her parents. On the other hand, she feels confused and frustrated in ways she can't quite explain. The last time she Nye Communities Coalition Comprehensive Community Prevention Plan 2021 -2024 Page 107 got in trouble for sk ipping school the vice principal at her school pulled her aside and told her that if she ever wanted to talk to let him know. She was expecting him to be angry, but he seemed concerned instead. Heather thinks he might be someone she can trust, someone who might be able to help her understand the frustration she is feeling and why she keeps making decisions that get her in trouble. Now that Heather is nearing graduation, she is starting to see that she some of her decisions have left her less prepared to g o to college than some of her peers might be. She's starting to wonder what her future might look like and she's frightened that she's already limited her options. Bill, Business Owner, Pahrump Bill owns a restaurant in Pahrump. He and his wife moved to Pahrump ten years ago to retire. They found retirement to be boring so opened a restaurant. Bill's children are grown and live two states away. Young people tend to congregate in Bill's restaurant. He routinely overhears their conversations. He sees the m during community events. He knows many of their parents and even some of their extended families. Bill is worried. He thinks the young people he is seeing seem lonely and anxious. He worries about how much time they spend on their cell phones. Bill would like to help in some way, but he doesn't want to butt into family business. He doesn't want to overstep any boundaries. When he hears the young people planning a party, who should he call? When he overhears a troubling conversation between a young dating couple, what should he do? What should he do when a young man is sitting in one of his booths alone crying? Bill feels like he might be the only one paying attention to all of these young people. Courtney, 6th Grade Teacher, Tonopah, NV Courtney has bee n teaching 6h grade in Tonopah for 5 years. She loves the energy and enthusiasm of 6th graders. Even though she's had 5 years of experience now, teaching is difficult. Courtney puts in very long days planning her lessons and meeting all of the standards. S he spends extra time offering tutoring before and after school and keeping up with COVID -19 protocols. She communicates with parents at all hours of the day and night to accommodate their work schedules. Courtney knows that middle school is a tricky time. She sees her students start to diverge Nye Communities Coalition Comprehensive Community Prevention Plan 2021 -2024 Page 108 into \"good\" groups and \"bad\" groups during middle school. She worries about those students get labeled as \"bad\" and strongly believes that their futures depend on making good decisions now and over the next few years. Courtney is vaguely aware that the School District has some social emotional learning curriculum. She knows the counselors and social workers at her school. Courtney is aware of NyECC but can't really explain what they do. She wants to do more to help her students navigate other parts of their lives, but, frankly, it's all she can do to teach them fractions and pre -algebra. Janice and Brad, Young Adults, Pahrump, NV Janice and Brad are in their late 20s and moved to Pahrump to work in the casino indu stry. It is cheaper to live in Pahrump than in Las Vegas. They live in an apartment building that is primarily inhabited by other casino workers. The couple do not have children or many other responsibilities and spend a lot of their time off gambling and partying with their friends. They don't drink and drive, they don't miss work, and they don't get into fights or any other kinds of trouble. Brad saw a poster about problem gambling that said, \"When the fun stops.\" Since then he and Janice have had a few c onversations about whether or not their substance use and gambling is \"normal\" or if it is a \"problem.\" They have plans for a family some day and career aspirations. They wonder how they are supposed to judge whether or not what they are doing is problemat ic. Shirley and John, Separated Family, Amargosa Valley, NV Shirley is the mother of two children: Brandon, 10; and Sam, 12. Both boys attend Amargosa School (prek -8th grade). Prior to COVID -19 both boys participated in several after school and summer activities (primarily sports and scouts) and both did relatively well in school. Shirley and the boys' father, John, have established a respectful, healthy co -parenting relationship. John works on a local farm and Shirley works for the Never Give Up Youth Healing Center. Before COVID -19, life was hectic but Shirley and John were managing relatively well. They relied on grandparents to supervise the boys after - school and d uring school breaks. The sudden closures related to the COVID -19 pandemic threw the family's schedules into complete disarray. Nye Communities Coalition Comprehensive Community Prevention Plan 2021 -2024 Page 109 Shirley was furloughed for a few months and has recently returned to work full -time. John has continued to work full -time through out the pandemic. The boys' schools have gone back and forth between in person and hybrid, with or without masks. Every facet of Shirley and John's lives, and their relationship, has been impacted by COVID -19. Shirley and John have very different risk tolerances for potential exposure to COVID -19 and they argue constantly about where Shirley takes the boys and how they spend their time when they are with her. The grandparents are at high -risk for COVID -19 so are not able to supervise or transport the boy s. Shirley and John are trying to figure out how to get the boys to and from school. They don't know how to supervise them on the days they are not at school and both parents are at work. Shirley and John are arguing about how safe school, the school bus, or after school activities will be. They disagree about wearing masks and about whether the boys should be spending time with their friends or at their friends' homes. They are also arguing about how much time the boys are spending playing video games and on their cell phones now that they can't participate in their normal activities. They struggled to help the boys complete their online work last spring and they are dreading the beginning of the school year. These differences of opinion are starting to und ermine every interaction between Shirley and John. Issues that they thought they had worked through years ago are starting to pop back up under the strain. Both Shirley and John are starting to notice behavior issues with the boys. There have been inciden ces of defiance and angry verbal outbursts with both parents and even some physical altercations between the boys. Shirley and John fully understand that their disagreements are having a negative impact on the boys. They also realize that these early signs of rebelliousness, lack of self -control, and frustration can lead to negative behaviors in the years to come. They are willing to get some help to resolve their issues, but they don't know where to turn. Shirley and John go to work and go home. They both listen to internet radio and read internet news. They have very little idea of what is available in the community. To reiterate, the object of looking at these vertical slices is to take a 360\u00b0 view to brainstorm where and how people might interact with N yECC. The exercise should help Nye Communities Coalition Comprehensive Community Prevention Plan 2021 -2024 Page 110 NyECC better understand the structures and systems in place and where they might best fit in.
