Background: Endometriosis, a non-lethal cancer-like inflammatory condition, and cancer share common features, with the major being the inability of the organism to confront the cause of disease initiation due to an incompetent immune and homeostatic surveillance, respectively. In addition, and to a degree, both diseases can be detected by identical diagnostic tools and treatment can be successfully achieved by a number of common substances found in nature that can fortify the organism's defense mechanisms to combat disease. Thus, this commentary focuses on and discusses the remedial action pine bark extracts (Pycnogenol\u00ae), almond skins, Agaricus Blazei murrill, oleuropein and oleocanthal may have on a destabilized organism that fails to combat illness by its own. Such a similarity in diagnosis and treatment may become as an alternative approach to create models of investigation for both diseases.

Clinical and Developmental Immunology 2005 Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics 2010 Objective Human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) has been implicated in eutopic and ectopic glandular epithelial cells in endometriosis. We investigated the expression of HLA-DR in endometriotic and adenomyotic tissues within the stromal and glandular cells. Moreover, we correlate the HLA-DR expression according the transvaginal ultrasonography findings. Methods We studied operative and pathologic reports of 113 women who underwent laparoscopic or laparotomy treatment of endometrioma or adenomyosis. Tissues from 51 women with endometrioma and 62 women with adenomyosis were retrospectively evaluated. The distribution and intensity of the HLA-DR immunostaining was assessed using electron microscopy. Pathologic finding of the uterine junction zone and the size of endometrioma were evaluated with the laparoscopic results and the ultrasound findings. Results In adenomyosis tissues, the percentage of HLA-DR cells expression was significantly higher in stromal cells (83.9%) compared to glandular cells (25.8%), (p < 0.001). The number of HLA-DR-positive endometriotic glandular cells was significantly higher than the total glandular adenomyotic cells (p < 0.005). HLA-DR-positive cells was significantly different between stromal (p < 0.016) and glandular cells (p < 0.044) in each side of endometrioma. Finally, HLA-DR-positive percentage cells were significantly more frequent in the secretory phase than the proliferative in stromal and glandular cells in both groups. Conclusion HLA-DR antigen expression in endometrium and adenomyotic tissues. However, HLA-DR expression is distributed preferentially in glandular epithelial cells in endometrioma and in the adenomyotic stroma. In both groups the HLA-DR expression was significantly higher in the secretory phase than the proliferative or glandular and stroma cells. Larger perspective studies are needed to establish the expression of HLA antigens in immune reactions which occur in adenomyosis and endometriosis.
