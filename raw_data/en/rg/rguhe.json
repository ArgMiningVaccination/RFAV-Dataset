From Donna Pascaretta: When I was in massage school my instructor said, \"If you want that muscle to relax you have to run energy. It will be the quickest way to relax the muscle.\" I was not sure what he meant. Do you plug something in, a device of some sort and massage the muscle with it? I didn't know. What he meant was very interesting. My instructor said you place your hand on the affected area and send energy from your hands. Hmm.... I thought. I had heard of [Healing Touch](https://www.mireproductivemedicine.com/what-we-do/infertility-treatments/integrative-medicine/). A lot of nurses were doing this modality. I thought I would check it out. I had my first treatment and I was amazed. The practitioner had me lie on a massage table and just close my eyes. I did keep one eye open so I could see what she was doing! She asked if I had any problems or health concerns. I told her I was there for stress reduction and relaxation. She first worked on the outer layers of my energy field. She didn't touch me, but sort of waved her hands over me. This technique is called magnetic clearing. I felt instantly more relaxed with each pass she made. She then place her hands gently on my ankles and worked her way up to my knees and then my hips etc. This is called a chakra connection. The process took about 50 minutes and after she finished I felt like had a full body massage! I was a believer and had to learn more. I completed all of the course level work and have been practicing Healing Touch and Reiki for over 15 years. [Reiki](https://www.mireproductivemedicine.com/what-we-do/infertility-treatments/reiki-therapy-and-massage/) (pronounced ray-key) means: Universal Life force energy. Reiki is an ancient hands on healing technique that is Eastern in origin. Reiki was rediscovered in the 1800's By Mikao Usui, but really is an ancient tradition that goes back to the time of Buddha. It is similar to Healing Touch in that you use energy, but Reiki is done in a specific way. The practitioner completes three course levels and is attuned at each level. Healing Touch contains different healing modalities or \"recipes \" which makes it different from Reiki. I love both modalities equally. Both modalities leave the client feeling peaceful, calm and relaxed. Both modalities promote restful sleep. I feel this work is so important for our patients experiencing difficulties conceiving a child. It is wonderful to work with Dr. Mersol-Barg and Dr. Singh who support my efforts to keep our patients calm during a very stressful time of their lives. Both of the doctors at MRM have experienced Reiki. I urge you to give it a try! I hope to keep you cool, calm, and on the way to making your dreams come true!
