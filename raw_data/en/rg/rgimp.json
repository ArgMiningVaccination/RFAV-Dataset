She sourced raw materials for vaccines and helped to coordinate clinical trials for combination cholesterol-lowering drugs. However, when her parents started pharmaceuticals long-term, she left corporate America to seek a more natural way to health. As a result, she finished the doctorate program for naturopathic medicine and master program for acupuncture at University of Bridgeport, CT. Afterwards, Dr. Lee decided to move back to her hometown in Lancaster, PA, to start her holistic practice. She is a licensed naturopathic doctor in the state of Vermont, and a licensed acupuncturist in the state of Pennsylvania.

The program consists of a minimum of 4,100 hours of class and clinical training. Training involves biomedical sciences such as physiology, pathology, biochemistry, gross anatomy, microbiology. Others include clinical nutrition, botanical medicine, homeopathy, psychology, counseling, and physical medicine. In conclusion, naturopathic medical students intern for over 1,000 hours of clinical work under the close supervision of licensed professionals. Given the importance of hands-on, clinical experience, the accrediting body for naturopathic medical colleges doesn't recognize degrees from online programs. As a result, a degree from an accredited medical school is required for licensure or certification by a state. The North American Board of Naturopathic Examiners (NABNE) administers the exam required for naturopathic doctor licensure. One must pass the Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Examinations (NPLEX) in order to be licensed by a state. Her naturopathic license is currently from Vermont as Pennsylvania will be registering naturopathic doctors when the registration law is applied. Meanwhile, the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians maintains a list of [states and territories](http://www.naturopathic.org/content.asp?contentid=57) that license or certify naturopathic doctors.
