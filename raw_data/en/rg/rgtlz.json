Young adults are a priority population prone to vaccine hesitancy. Colleges and universities can impact a segment of this population through the development of communication campaigns to promote vaccination. Methods: Multiple cross-sectional samples of undergraduate and graduate students from a large Midwestern university were surveyed from January to May 2021 (n = 2398). The Reasoned Action Approach was used to identify factors associated with vaccination intentions, and one-way ANOVA models were conducted to examine the impact of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine pause in April 2021 on perceptions of vaccine safety and efficacy. Results: Student campus (=-0.041, Standard Error (SE)=0.041), perceptions of vaccine safety (=0.208, SE=0.033), of (=0.101, SE=0.018) were significantly associated with intention to get a COVID-19 vaccine. The J&J vaccine pause did not significantly impact perceptions of vaccine safety and efficacy. Conclusions: Influencing attitude toward vaccination, the belief that getting vaccinated is a good thing to do, is critical when developing a health communication campaign to encourage new vaccination uptake among college students. Messages regarding perceived normative beliefs, self-efficacy, and perceptions of vaccine safety and efficacy should also be considered in the early stage of campaign development. A mass media approach may be most successful to adapt to frequent ongoing changes during vaccine distribution. "}
