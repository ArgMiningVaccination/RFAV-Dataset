Conditions Commonly Treated ACUPUNCTURE Acupuncture is the most widely known of all TCM health tools. This system dates back thousands of years to China, where early doctors recognized that stimulating areas on the body with pressure, heat and pointed tools could reliably produce predictable effects, such as relieving pain, nausea, constipation/diarrhea, respiratory distress, menstrual issues, and mental anxiety or depression. In a way to organize and explain these phenomena, early doctors over hundreds of years carefully recorded what they learned and slowly developed both a mapping system and mechanistic theory of how and why it worked. This led to a clustering of points into common regions that we know today as the meridian system. Later I will describe in more western terms what the meridian system may be. Treating health issues with acupuncture Contrary to much popular media, acupuncture is not simply a \"point by number\" method of relieving bodily discomfort where you can pick up a book on 20 great acupressure points and solve all your issues. This unfortunate concept has led many people to rub a point \"to relieve a headache/toothache/bellyache\" etc and when it didn't work, they then dismiss an entire field of medicine that has been used successfully by millions of people over thousands of years. To me, this would be like walking into a mechanic's workshop, grabbing a random tool, turning a random screw on an car, and then wondering why it didn't fix the issue that the car had. Effectively utilizing acupuncture involves a detailed inquiry and exam by a trained acupuncturist to categorize the individual patient's cluster of signs and symptoms into a discernible diagnostic pattern, for which certain points are selected. Sounds easy enough, right? Some one comes in and complains of a headache. Should be easily enough- just look up headache points! Not so. In TCM-- and in western medicine-- headaches occur for a wide variety of reasons. Sorting out a patient's headache into one of about nine patterns-- each with different acupoint combinations- is where all an acupuncturist's training comes into play.
