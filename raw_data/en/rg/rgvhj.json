These are some of my top lunar crystals for working with the energy of the New Moon for intentions, ceremonies, letting go or starting a new project... The New Moon Phase The New Moon also known as the Dark Moon occurs around once every 29 days. Today this is seen as the day when the Moon is dark and has no light. At this time the Moon is 100% covered by the shadow of the Earth. From this day onwards the light begins to return to the Moon and the waxing Moon phase will begin again, see diagram below. Working With The New Moon There are two main ways that you can work with the New Moon phase. You can use it to let go of the past or free yourself from toxic relationships. The New Moon supports you in ending bad habits and negative patterns in your life. The other way is to work with the New Moon energy to plan and set intentions. Many see this as a time to plant new seeds for what they want to manifest or change. It supports starting new projects and developing new habits. Moonology & Lunar Astrology The Astrologer, Yasmin Boland has a comprehensive holistic guide to working with all the phases of the Moon. I recommend it because it interprets the phases in relation to your Sun sign. This lets you know how the Full and New Moon affect you personally.

Checking New Moon Times You may notice that some printed calendars show the New Moon days but make sure the dates are correct for your country. If you want to be precise, check a good Moon app or website like [Deluxe Moon](http://www.deluxemoon.com/). I find their app is really handy to have on my phone. TIP: Mark the days of the New Moon on your calendar or planner with a black circle! Working With Crystals For The New Moon You could wear one of these stones or carry it on you during the day of the New Moon. Why not use crystals for the New Moon phase in your meditations, visualisations, ceremonies, rituals or spiritual work you are doing at this time? I recommend conscious planning at this time. InnerGuide planners are a way to ensure that you break down any goals into steps that you can set time for throughout the month or year. I've been using them for years.

They are all activated by the New Moon phase. I chose these crystals because they all carry the general energy of this phase of the Moon. You can choose any crystal that aligns with your intentions. Many of these crystals help remove blocks and create the space needed for the blessings to come to you! Black Moonstone This is a form of Feldspar which has a black, grey and sometimes a little brown colouring. Black Moonstone is protective and strengthens your intuition to help you make better decisions. Work with this dark beauty when you are ready to do some shadow work. It helps you release things that may be holding you back from making changes. Labradorite Colourful Labradorite is a supportive guide through any life changes. It helps you grow through and adapt to life transitions. If you're making changes during the New Moon, Labradorite will assist you in any personal and spiritual transformation. You can even work with this stone to release outdated vows taken in other lifetimes. Black Kyanite The black variety of Kyanite grows into these fascinating fan-like crystal formations. Black Kyanite helps you release the past and clear your aura and chakras. You can work with this crystal when doing etheric cord-cutting exercises and meditations. It will help sever any connection in a toxic or unhealthy relationship or friendship. Desert Rose Selenite This stunning crystal formation is a form of Selenite that grows in sand. This stone is very delicate and friable so be very careful with it. Place it on your altar or meditate with it, remember to wash your hands after touching it. All Selenite carries lunar energies and this one is no different. During the New Moon phase, this crystal will help cleanse your aura and chakra system of negative or old energy. See my short YouTube video below for more info: Merlinite Merlinite is the metaphysical name given to a milky white Agate or Chalcedony (some say opal) with back dendritic inclusions. It should not be confused with Mystic Merlinite, another stone. This magical crystal helps you create sacred ceremonies and work with lunar astrology. Merlinite increases your intuition and assists you in developing your manifestation skills. Smoky Quartz This is the smoky variety of clear Quartz. Smoky Quartz helps keep you grounded during lunar energy shifts. This dark crystal is useful because it absorbs negative energy around you. Not only that, but it is also an excellent tool to help you monitor negative thought patterns so you can develop more positive ones. Smoky Quartz assists you in working through and releasing any fears that are holding you back. TIP - Combine Smoky Quartz with any of the other crystals for the New Moon for a transformative combo!
