Allegedly, the therapist replaced the boy's insulin with herbal remedies. Tim Morrow, 83, was charged with - child abuse causing death - and with practicing medicine without a license. Morrow stated that god had guided him to use herbs rather than conventional medicine and that he successfully treated treat his own prostate cancer in this way. Marrow can be seen on multiple [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaP7e2niq30&index=37&list=PL46D61D02224F88DE&t=0s) from his 'University of Common Sense' promoting his bizarre ideas of health and disease. Perhaps god also guided Marrow to make lots of money? He runs regular seminars and a thriving herbal on-line business, the ' [Common Sense Herbal Products](http://www.commonsenseherbs.com/index.aspx)'. There are few ailments, for which 'Common Sense Herbal Products' do not seem to offer a herbal cure. One of the remedies, ' [Pancreas Reg](https://www.commonsenseherbs.com/MemberToolsDotNet/ShoppingCartv4/ProductDetailv4.aspx?ProductID=18423&CatalogueID=208&MG=17&G1=67&G2=80&ReferringDealerID=43096)', for instance, claims to \"act as natural insulin\". The 270 Tablets tub of this product costs US $74.22. It is easy to see, I find, how bold claims attract gullible customers depriving them not just of their money but also of their health. Morrow started treating the boy suffering from Type 1 diabetes after he met his mother at one of his seminars. When the boy subsequently became semi-comatose, Morrow told his parents to treat their son with his herbal remedies rather than insulin which had been prescribed by qualified medical doctors. The boy, Edgar L., died only hours later. There is little doubt that he would have survived, if he had undergone conventional treatment, the medical examiner concluded. \"The allegations in this case underscore the serious health and safety risks of taking medical advice from someone who lacks a license and the proper training that goes with it,\" the medical examiner said in a statement. \"No family should have to suffer the tragedy of losing a child because of irresponsible, un-credentialed medical advice.\" On this blog, during lectures etc., I often stress that by far the biggest danger of seemingly harmless alternative therapies is that they are used to replace effective treatments for serious conditions. Diabetes is such a condition, and there are numerous instances where the advice of incompetent practitioners has endangered the lives of diabetics. Three examples will have to suffice as examples of the plethora of such unethical neglect: - \" [In homeopathy](https://edzardernst.com/2015/07/if-you-think-that-homeopathy-is-harmless-read-this/), diabetes is seen as a reflection of the body's inability to function optimally. There is an imbalance that results in the body's incapacity to effectively utilize the insulin that it produces, or to produce sufficient insulin for its needs. While symptoms often disappear after conventional treatment, the vital force does not. Homoeopathy can be used effectively in the treatment of diabetes. Here we mainly concentrate on functioning of the pancreas in efficient insulin production. The metabolic condition of a patient suffering from diabetes requires both therapeutic and nutritional measures to correct the illness. Homeopathy can regulate sugar metabolism while helping to resolve the metabolic disturbances that lead to diabetes. Furthermore, homeopathy helps stimulate the body's self-healing powers in order to prevent complications such as open leg sores and other dysfunctions of the blood vessel, loss of vision, kidney failure. Homeopathic treatment does not target one illness, an organ, a body part or a symptom. Remedies are prescribed based on an assembly of presenting symptoms, their stresses in life.\" - \" [Management of Blood sugar](https://edzardernst.com/2014/11/homeopathy-this-is-how-it-could-kill-millions/). The commonly used remedies are Uranium Nitricum, Phosphoric Acid, Syzygium Jambolanum, Cephalandra Indica etc. These are classical Homeopathic remedies. These are used in physiologically active doses such as Mother tincture, 3x etc. depending up on the level of the blood sugar and the requirement of the patient. Several pharmaceutical companies have also brought in propriety medicines with a combination of the few Homeopathic medicines. Biochemic remedies which is a part of Homeopathy advocates Biocombination No 7 as a specific for Diabetes. Another Biochemic medicine Natrum Phos 3x is widely used with a reasonable success in controlling the blood sugar. Scientific studies on the impact of homeopathic medicines in bringing down blood sugar are limited, but many of the above remedies have some positive effects either as a stand-alone remedy or as an adjunct along with other medications.\" - \" [Modern medicine](https://edzardernst.com/2014/11/alternative-medicines-to-die-for/)has no permanent cure for diabetes but alternative medicines like yoga ,mudra,ayurveda is very useful to control and even cure diabetes.Ayurveda is an alternative medicine to cure diabetes.\" But these are very rare instances!!! That's what apologists usually respond. Yet, the truth is that NOBODY knows how often such harm occurs. Why? There is no monitoring system anywhere that would provide such information. "}
