What should I expect when I first visit a Naturopath? The Initial appointment with a naturopath tends to be much longer than a conventional medical appointment (usually 60 to 90 minutes). This will involve taking a detailed case history to help identify the underlying causes of your health problem. I will ask you about current health, diet, lifestyle, health history and family history. We will then conduct some in clinic testing and specific laboratory tests if necessary. Please bring along a copy of any recent medical tests and a list or photo of supplements or medications. We can then put together the most effective treatment plan to meet your needs I can help you to set goals, priorities and timelines. Then I will help to set challenges in manageable steps so that you can easily make progress. For example, you may want help to set goals and make a plan to start introducing changes to your eating habits. Or you may need support to develop some good sleep habits or get started on an exercise programme when you haven't been exercising for a while? Follow-up visits are recommended to assess how well the plan fits and to make any necessary changes It is important that you attend regularly to get the most out of your support as your treatment plan, prescription and remedies will be modified as required and as your condition improves. The duration of treatment will depend on your presenting health condition and the level of complexity. You may need to come weekly or fortnightly at first, then monthly. You will generally start to notice changes within a week or two of starting treatment. However, I usually recommend a 6 - 12 week program to fully implement changes. Many people then schedule a 3 monthly check up after they complete their treatment.
