This legislation created the land-grant uni- versity system that serves as a cornerstone of American public higher education. As a land-grant institution, the University of Kentucky is responsible for serving the people of the Common-wealth of Kentucky. The College of Agriculture, with its research, teaching, and extension activities, has developed a structure and organization to provide the mandated land-grant services in agriculture and related areas. The Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station has been providing research results to farmers and rural residents for more than 130 years. The continued progress of Kentucky ag-riculture attests to the benefits of applying new knowledge and technology. College researchers also have successfully addressed problems of agribusiness, consumers, international trade, food processing, nutrition, community development, soil and water resources, bioenergy, and the environment. Experiment station research spans both basic and applied sciences. The ability of Kentucky producers to be competitive in domestic and world markets requires an expanded base of knowledge in emerging areas of research applicable to agricul-ture, food, and natural resources. This annual report lists experi-ment station research projects and publications completed dur - ing 2011. The research programs of the Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station have benefited Kentucky's agriculture over the past century, and the results of present and future research will continue to serve Kentucky's primary industry. In 2011, research activities of the Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station were conducted at Lexington, Princeton, Quicksand, and Owenton and in counties throughout the state. Efforts are constantly made to ensure that the research studies have application to the problems of all Kentucky farmers and other clientele groups. Locations of the experimental facilities provide conditions representative of most sections of the state.

The initiative provides leadership and focus to interdisciplinary basic and applied research, interdepartmental graduate and undergraduate instruction, and highly collabora-tive extension and engagement services in environmental and natural resources. ENRI operates through a series of working groups, which are chaired by College of Agriculture faculty members. These working groups allow faculty and staff to coalesce around a topic or project to discuss and work on agricultural issues. ENRI staff provides services to faculty, staff, and students to help them con-duct outreach and research programs on campus and throughout the community. Services provided include assistance with the logistics of workshops and conferences, creation and submission of proposals, grant management, and web site maintenance. The Kentucky T obacco Research and Development Center (KTRDC) mission is to utilize plant-based technology to benefit Kentucky agriculture. The focus is on the use of science, includ-ing molecular biology, genomics, plant genetic engineering, plant breeding/field research, and other advanced technologies to improve agriculture. Research focuses on the enhancement of tobacco and other Nicotiana species as a production system for plant-based products (including pharmaceuticals and industrial materials), for discovering new plant natural products having potential for commercialization, and on applied research in sup- port of Kentucky tobacco production. KTRDC houses a business incubator to assist agriculture-based start-up companies in com-mercializing new technologies. Other facilities include research laboratories, greenhouses, and contained growth facilities for plant disease and genetic engineering research. The goal is to utilize these resources to preserve and strengthen agriculture in Kentucky and, in particular, tobacco agriculture. Research Focus In the Kentucky Revised Statutes, one of the stated duties for the Kentucky T obacco Research Board (KTRB) is to provide oversight of state funds appropriated for tobacco research. The first area of research emphasis for KTRDC is given as \"preserving and strengthening tobacco agriculture in Kentucky. \" With pas - sage of the Family Smoking Prevention and T obacco Control Act, the FDA was given authority to regulate tobacco products, and the KTRB has indicated support for KTRDC to focus research efforts to better assist Kentucky tobacco growers in response to this new regulatory environment. The FDA regulatory system is still being developed, but all information suggests that this evolving regulatory system should be based on science. KTRDC intends to contribute to the science of this impending tobacco regulation and to explore opportuni-ties for our academic research center to be involved in research related to the major changes likely to result from tobacco product regulation. T o support this research effort, KTRDC is expanding and upgrading its tobacco analytical capability, and considerable progress is being made toward establishing a tobacco analytical lab. This lab will provide support to University of Kentucky tobacco extension, breeding, and research as the groups involved in those activities adapt their research efforts in response to FDA regulation. Through this initiative, we have merged efforts with Dr. Lowell Bush's analytical lab in the Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, hired new researchers, and upgraded equipment. Our goal is to continue the work to build on this well-established lab as we prepare for changes in the tobacco industry related to FDA regulation. As part of this merger, KTRDC is now responsible for the analysis of foundation seed and maintenance of tobacco seed stocks using the low converter ( LC) protocol to screen all burley and dark tobacco varieties related to tobacco-specific nitrosa-mines (TSNAs). All new burley and dark tobacco varieties that are developed go through the variety release program and will continue to be evaluated by the lab. Thus, KTRDC now has direct impact on burley and dark tobacco producers in the state of Ken-tucky. In addition, KTRDC was part of a group that received funds from the Specific Cooperative Agreement between the College of Agriculture and the USDA Forage Animal Production Research Unit, a five-year agreement to support forage research and analyti- cal analysis of forage samples from other research groups. KTRDC is also initiating new research projects in response to expected FDA tobacco product regulation. In November, a \"tobacco sum-mit\" was held at which Kentucky tobacco researchers met with KTRDC scientists to identify critical areas for which research is needed. Through this process, KTRDC funded 12 pilot projects to encourage collaboration between KTRDC scientists and re-searchers in applied tobacco research. The list of funded projects below suggests the wide range of projects being undertaken and the relevance to Kentucky tobacco producers. Enhanced senescence as a strategy to reduce the occurrence of green color in air-cured tobacco TSNA accumulation in a controlled curing environment Mutation populations for use in the development of tobacco varieties having novel characteristics Phenotypic data collection to develop molecular markers for nic1 and nic2 Evaluation of black shank resistance in dark tobacco Enzymatic denitrosation of tobacco-specific nitrosamines Field tests for phenotypic data collection to corroborate molecular marker work-demethylase mutants Study of stability of TSNA standards The effects of cytokinin application on the production of tobacco-specific nitrosamines8 Transfer of gene knockdown constructs into elite tobacco lines to alter tobacco organoleptic properties Increased chlorophyll in burley Surveying populations of Thanatephorus cucumeris and Cercospora nicotianae for sensitivity to azoxystrobin 2011 Highlights: Supported 33 research projects in addition to the new tobacco summit grants, for which progress reports can be found in the KTRDC Annual Report for 2001-2011. This report can be found on our web site at www.ca.uky.edu/KTRDC. Continued to participate in conferences, workshops, and other events worldwide. A particular emphasis was placed on participation in tobacco-related conferences such as the T obacco Science Research Conference (four KTRDC researchers gave presentations), the CORESTA Congress (two KTRDC researchers gave presentations), the recent T obacco Workers Conference (seven KTRDC researchers gave presentations) as well as other scientific conferences. Through this process, we are engaging other tobacco research organizations around the world and are establishing new collaborations and research projects. KTRDC has reincorporated the Kentucky Reference Cigarette Program. This program provides research standards for tobac - co health and industry research. The reference cigarettes are necessary for emerging tobacco product regulation and play a key role in KTRDC's efforts to establish a tobacco analytical lab. Dr. Maelor Davies has transitioned into a faculty position in the Department of Plant and Soil Sciences to focus more on teaching and research. Dr. Orlando Chambers is now the KTRDC managing director, and Dr. Ling Yuan is now the KTRDC research director. Both will work under the leader - ship of the College of Agriculture to guide KTRDC toward mission-relevant research. KTRDC has formally integrated the research efforts of Dr. Hongyan Zhu (Plant and Soil Sci-ence) and Dr. Jan Smalle (Plant and Soil Sciences) into the in-house research program. AgTeCC The AgT eCC incubator is located in the KTRDC building and has a mission to provide an optimal laboratory environ-ment for startup and emerging companies having research-based activities consistent with the KTRDC research mandate. Companies eligible for residence in AgT eCC aim to develop new crop-agriculture technologies into profitable businesses that can benefit farmers and the knowledge-based economy in Kentucky. AgT eCC provides an environment that is fully equipped for plant biotechnology research and includes access to plant-growth and tissue culture resources and services. The incubator currently houses two companies that occupy 100% of the avail-able research space. Regulatory Services The Division of Regulatory Services is committed to con- sumer protection and service to Kentucky citizens, businesses, and industries. Our regulatory programs monitor and analyze feed, fertilizer, milk, and seed products. Our service programs in milk, seed, and soil are administered using a cooperative, science-based approach. The division administers four state laws covering ingredients, manufacturing, processing, labeling, and marketing of feed, fer - tilizer, seed, and raw milk. Our primary objectives are to protect consumers of these products from poor quality, mislabeling, adulteration, and misrepresented products and to protect busi-nesses marketing high-quality products from unfair competition. Feed, fertilizer, and seed are monitored from ingredients through manufacturing and retail channels for compliance. Label review, product and facility inspections, product sampling by our inspectors, and analysis in our laboratories are important steps in this process. Raw milk is monitored during marketing to (1) ensure accurate and equitable exchange between dairy producers and processors and (2) ensure integrity of milk from farm to processor. Eight regulatory inspectors and one auditor cover the state collecting samples, inspecting facilities, reviewing labels, and auditing records. Audits of sales and fee payments are conducted on feed, fertilizer, seed, and milk firms in Kentucky to verify re-ports, records, and fee payments. One inspector is dedicated to the milk program for auditing payment records and monitoring activities of sampler-weighers, handlers, lab personnel, and lab facilities. The activities in the division are performed by a dedicated and professional staff that conduct lab analyses, provide administra-tive and computer support, process data, and compile reports in addition to various other duties necessary to carry out and administer effective programs. Feed Regulatory Program The feed regulatory program provides consumer protection for livestock feed and pet food according to provisions of the Kentucky Commercial Feed Law. The program ensures safety, suitability, and quality of animal feed in producing meat, milk, and eggs for human consumption and products for companion animals. The program provides standards of quality, safety, ef - ficacy, and labeling for feed products. A statewide inspection, sampling, and lab analysis program monitors feed ingredients and feed products. Feed labels are evaluated to identify purpose of feed, guaranteed composition, ingredient list, feeding direc - tions, and the need for any warning or caution statements. The feed program participates in food safety efforts that promote consumer confidence in the nation's food supply. We work cooperatively with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in assessing compliance with the ruminant-to-ruminant feeding ban to prevent any establishment or amplification of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or \"mad cow disease\").92011 Highlights: Performed official inspections on 1,298 feed manufacturers and dealers Collected 2,507 official samples; others provided 46 unofficial samples that resulted in 17,385 lab analyses for more than 2 million tons of feed marketed Collected 823 specialty pet food samples for analysis Monitored the 2011 corn crop for mycotoxins including afla - toxin, fumonisin, and vomitoxin. More than 300 mycotoxin analyses were conducted on feed samples during the year. Conducted 75 BSE inspections for compliance and inspected four feed mills that mix restricted drugs in feed for compli-ance with current Good Manufacturing Practices Maintained registration on more than 19,000 feed products from nearly 1,200 companies and conducted new product label reviews on more than 1,000 products Analyzed and reported 55 feed samples from quality control programs Used 43 different approved analytical methods in providing results Income from inspection fees and product registration re-ceived during the period of July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2011 was $1,081,176. Inspection fees are assessed at 35 cents/ton, and annual registration of $50 is collected for products sold in less than 10-lb packages. Fertilizer Regulatory Program The Kentucky Fertilizer Law ensures that fertilizers sold in Kentucky are clearly and accurately labeled so that consumers can make informed purchases of fertilizer with confidence in its quality. The law and supporting regulations also protects the legitimate fertilizer industry from unfair competition. 2011 Highlights: Administered actions on 2,616 official and 11 unofficial samples involving over 8,000 chemical analyses The official samples represented about 50,000 tons of the ap-proximately 890,000 tons of fertilizer distributed in Kentucky during 2011, or about 5.6%. Reviewed labels and registered 4,548 products from 658 firms and issued licenses to 203 companies that manufactured custom-blended fertilizers Analyzed fertilizer materials from special quality control pro-grams that included all-purpose fertilizers, urea-ammonium nitrate solutions, phosphate rock, manufactured phosphates, and other special fertilizers Provided support for 15 different analytical methods that yielded results for 28 analytes and potential contaminants Substantiated cash receivables with income from registration fees, inspection fees, and licenses received from July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2011 that totaled $654,684. Fertilizers are assessed an inspection fee of 50 cents/ton. Milk Regulatory Program The mission of the milk regulatory program is to ensure that raw farm milk produced and marketed in Kentucky is bought and sold using accurate weights and tests. The program's primary function is to monitor milk handling systems starting with the point at which a producer's milk is sampled and weighed through delivery and laboratory testing and until producer payments are calculated. The program provides support to the producers and processors of Kentucky's $300 million/year dairy industry. Industry participants are trained, licensed, and subsequently monitored to maintain compliance with the law. In addition to regulatory functions, the milk program coop- erates with other agencies in educational projects to provide a variety of services to Kentucky dairy producers, processors, and allied industries. The milk program also operates a laboratory that is available for Kentucky producer, processor, and handler testing. 2011 Highlights: Reviewed applications and issued licenses to 2 transfer sta-tions, 24 milk handlers, 18 laboratories, 77 technicians, and 342 sampler-weighers Analyzed and administered actions on 7,492 milk samples Administered a monthly milk lab quality control check sample program through the distribution of 2,640 samples to the 18 licensed labs and 2 other labs to ensure accurate component-analysis procedures Conducted 9 pay-record and 17 raw milk receiving audits Conducted 30 milk lab inspections Collaborated with the Kentucky Cabinet for Health Services Milk Safety Branch to train sampler-weighers and processor receiving personnel Trained and examined 13 new sampler-weighers and 7 new technicians Conducted 4 inspections of raw milk transfer stations Conducted 340 sampler-weigher inspections Provided analysis for research projects pertaining to cow comfort, somatic cell testing, horse milk, and other research in the College Provided analysis for Kentucky small processor cheese makers Continued sample age study to determine if the time allowed for milk sample analysis after collection can be increased from 72 hours to 120 hours Cash receivables were substantiated on 92 milk reports, and income from fees and licenses received from July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2011 was $198,151. Milk handlers and producers are assessed inspection fees at 0.005 cents/100 lb. Seed Regulatory Program The seed regulatory program ensures Kentucky farmers and urban consumers of quality seed while maintaining fair and eq-uitable competition among seed dealers and seedsmen through inspection and analysis of products found in the marketplace. The division, which administers and implements the Kentucky Seed Law, promotes compliance through facility inspections, sampling, and analysis of seed offered for sale. The law requires proper labeling of seed, which includes kind, variety, and lot designation, seed purity percentages, presence of noxious weeds, seed origin, presence of inert matter, seed analysis date, and a seed germination guarantee. The division is also responsible for maintaining registration of the state's seed labelers, seed conditioners, and seed dealers.102011 Highlights: Performed 1,192 inspections of agricultural, lawn, turf, and garden seeds at Kentucky seed processing, wholesale, and retail locations Collected 1,579 official seed samples for laboratory analysis Issued stop-sale orders on 203 official seed samples and 211 violative seed lots at seed dealer and seed processor locations Cooperated with the USDA/AMS-Seed Regulatory and T est - ing Branch related to interstate seed shipments into Kentucky that violated the Federal Seed Act Reviewed and issued 212 agricultural seed permits and 51 vegetable and flower permits to label seed Registered 613 seed dealers Registered 25 non-certified custom seed conditioners that add coatings to seed Provided training to several firms on labeling requirements, retail sales procedures, stop sale release procedures, and record-keeping requirements. Cash receivables were substantiated on 796 seed reports, and the income from fees, permits, and licenses received from July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2011 was $401,305. Seed products are assessed an inspection fee at 4 to 24 cents/unit, depending on unit size. Seed Testing Laboratory The division maintains the only certified seed analysis facility in Kentucky. This facility handles all official samples collected by inspectors and provides service testing for seed producers, dealers, retailers, research projects, and homeowners for a fee. More than 90% of the service samples handled by the laboratory in 2011 were submitted by Kentucky firms and individuals. The laboratory analyzes seed for purity, identifies weed and crop seed, conducts germination, counts seed, determines test weight, performs accelerated aging, conducts fluorescence test - ing on ryegrass, determines moisture content, conducts tetrazo-lium analysis, assesses herbicide tolerance, determines presence of endophyte, and conducts many other analyses. Our analysts keep abreast of changes through participation in regional and national referee testing with the Association of Official Seed Analysts (AOSA) and the USDA Federal Seed Laboratory and by attending special scheduled and regular workshops at the AOSA annual meeting. All analysts are AOSA-certified in areas of purity and germination. 2011 Highlights: Analyzed 6,441 service samples Collaborated with researchers to analyze 110 seed samples Supported the equine and livestock pasture management programs in analyzing 113 plant samples for endophytes Analyzed 23 seed samples under the provision that allows one free sample for testing each year from Kentucky residents Income derived from service samples from July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2011 was $63,842. Soil Testing Laboratory The soil testing laboratories at Lexington and Princeton pro- vide farmers, homeowners, greenhouse operators, and others with scientific information about the fertility status of their soils or media used for crop production or plant growth. In partner - ship with the Cooperative Extension Service, the soils laboratory provides lime and fertilizer recommendations based on the lab analysis. Analyses of animal wastes, nutrient solutions, and special research solutions are also offered. The program received $244,465 from July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2011 for testing services.

Robinson Center for Appalachian Resource Sustainability At Quicksand in Breathitt County, the Robinson Center for Appalachian Resource Sustainability (RCARS) is the east region location for research on fruits and vegetables, ornamen-tals, livestock forages, grain crops, biomass crops, tobacco, and wood utilization. The Robinson Center is also the administra-tive headquarters of Robinson Forest, which spreads over parts of Breathitt, Perry, and Knott counties and is the research site for forestry, wildlife, surface mine reclamation, and watershed management. The Robinson Center for Appalachian Resource Sustainability has the budgetary and physical responsibility for managing the research facilities at Quicksand, the UK Wood Utilization Cen-ter, and Robinson Forest. The mission of this re-organized unit is to increase the long-term value-added, sustainable income and sustainable flow of economic, ecological, and social goods and services from the lands, natural resources, and people of eastern Kentucky and the Appalachian Region. 2011 Research Activities Robinson Center Department of Plant and Soil Sciences RCARS is the east region location for the livestock forage variety testing program. Results from these trials are pub-lished annually. RCARS is one of three sites devoted to soil fertility research in a no-tillage corn and soybean rotation involving comparisons of poultry litter and inorganic fertilizer.11 T o better understand nitrogen nutrition for corn, three rates of each of two materials added to UAN (urea-ammonium nitrate solution) to reduce fertilizer N losses and improve N fertilizer use efficiency were evaluated. Department of Plant Pathology Twenty experimental lines of tobacco were evaluated for resistance to blue mold as part of a collaborative international research project. In collaboration with horticulture faculty at RCARS, cucurbit downy mildew sentinel plots were established in the spring and summer of 2010 at the Robinson Center. These plots are used for early detection of downy mildew, a potentially devas - tating disease of cucurbits, and to determine which cucurbits (cucumbers, pumpkins, melons) will be most affected. Department of Horticulture Variety testing of asparagus and heirloom tomatoes Collaborative effort with Kentucky State University to evaluate the production of hops and hybrid filberts in eastern Kentucky Persimmon germplasm evaluation Strawberry plasticulture trial to evaluate winter hardiness and early-season production Department of Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering, Horticulture, Plant and Soil Sciences, and the Center for Applied Energy Research are investigating the potential energy production from alternative crops on marginal agricultural land. The plots were established in 2010, and measurements taken will include changes in soil carbon, biomass production, and potential energy production (as a liquid or solid fuel) from Miscanthus, switchgrass, black locust, and cottonwood. Robinson Forest Department of Entomology Research is being conducted on the ecological effects of the hemlock woolly adelgid, focusing on impacts on headwater streams and associated riparian zones (benthic and riparian macroinvertebrates, litter fall, stream chemistry). A host suitability study to the hemlock woolly adelgid is being conducted on five hemlock species growing in a common plot, representing a spectrum of resistance to the adelgid (from the highly resistant Chinese hemlock to the highly susceptible eastern hemlock).

Three continuing education workshops in hardwood silvicul- ture and invasive species control were conducted at Robinson Forest. In total, 78 professionals obtained training, resulting in 2,128 woodland owners being provided assistance and an estimated 76,608 acres of woodland being improved. Three trainings for profile knife grinding moulder setup and operation were held at the UK Wood Utilization Center, impacting nine companies with over $1.698 million saved/earned. UK's Department of Forestry at RCARS has worked with the Kentucky Division of Forestry in creating and maintaining a wood industries directory of the wood products companies in the state. T ooling design program for the secondary wood industry: T emplates for 26 different products were developed, result - ing in an estimated $65,000 in earned or saved revenue to the secondary wood industry. The UK Wood Utilization Center Entrepreneur Development Program: Three entrepreneurs are currently participating in this program to develop new wood products businesses. Mountain Monday Series: Monthly extension programs on a variety of topics are held at the RCARS the second Monday of each month. 4-H Natural Resource and Environmental Sciences Acad-emy: Seventh and eighth grade students are selected for this three-year program based on their academic achievements and teacher recommendations. Students study water, forestry, and wildlife resources at Robinson Forest. 2011 Teaching Activities Conducted at Robinson Forest NRC 320\u2014Field Experience in Data Collection T echniques FOR 355\u2014Forest Fire Control and Use FOR 356\u2014Landscape Assessment FOR 357\u2014Inventory and Measurements II FOR 358\u2014Silviculture Practices FOR 359\u2014Forest Operations and Utilization12Sustainable Agriculture and Food Systems Working Group The Sustainable Agriculture and Food Systems Working Group's mission is to create new knowledge to improve the sustainability of the food system in Kentucky and beyond, help Kentucky citizens and students understand sustainable agricul-ture and food systems, and promote UK's activities as they relate to sustainable agriculture and food systems as part of the land- grant mission. The group works across all departments within the College of Agriculture to develop synergy among them and its membership. Members of the working group are nominated by their department chairs and approved by the dean. Research Support and Activities UK Dining Services Members of the group continue to work closely with UK Dining Services as a national leader in farm-to-college efforts. The whole-beef carcass purchase program continues to provide high quality 100% Kentucky beef, pork, and chicken for use across the University and has an economic impact of over $2.5 million dollars annually, with most of that money going directly to the farms raising the animals. First Friday Breakfast Begun in April, this monthly event has become extremely popular with an ever-widening group including faculty, staff, ex - tension agents, students, and the general public. Open to anyone, it is held monthly on the first Friday (excluding January, July, and September) and features a local breakfast of local foods cooked on site by Chef Bob Perry and speakers covering a wide variety of topics specific to or associated with agriculture. Experts have given presentations on cheese making, meat processing, bee keeping, biotechnology, heirloom fruits and vegetables, poultry management, and agriculture and liberal arts, with many more topics to come. National Sustainable Agriculture Education Association Conference Over 150 agricultural educators and students from across the United States and a few foreign countries attended this confer - ence, which was hosted by UK and the working group in August. The highlight of the multi-day conference was an event held at the Horticulture Research Farm (South Farm) in Lexington. The event showcased the College's sustainable agriculture programs and research in an informal setting, focusing in particular on the farm's organic section. Some of Kentucky's best known chefs volunteered to prepare a multi-course meal served on the grounds that included fruit and produce grown at the farm by students. UK Dining Services was an invaluable partner in this event, providing a full mobile kitchen for the chefs to use and also providing all the china, flatware, glasses, and servers to orchestrate the event. Outreach Members of the working group had numerous contacts with farmers and citizens seeking University expertise on areas includ-ing marketing, manufacturing, and processing questions for all types of food and sustainable agriculture systems. The working group and UK's Food Systems Innovation Center work closely when the working group's technical expertise is needed. Members of the group are also frequent speakers across campus and at conferences worldwide. The Farmers Market Report on WUKY , Lexington's National Public Radio station, relies on working group members for much of the information broadcast weekly during the growing season. This report is now in its sixth year. UK Ag Equine Programs The year 2011 was one of change and growth. At the end of 2011, the Equine Initiative changed its name to UK Ag Equine Programs. The name change was undertaken by the College of Agriculture in consultation with its internal and external stake-holders to better reflect the breadth of equine offerings at UK and the College's long-term commitment to serving the state's signature equine industry. The new name was announced at the beginning of 2012, with plans for implementation to occur well into 2012. The stated mission of UK Ag Equine Programs is to discover, share, and apply new knowledge that will enhance the health, performance, and management of horses commensurate with the signature status of Kentucky's horse industry. It was launched in March 2005 when the College of Agricul- ture set out to radically change how it served Kentucky's signa-ture equine industry and provide a suite of services appropriate for a land-grant university. In acknowledging the success of those efforts and a continued commitment to the state's equine industry, the College adopted a new name to better position its equine programs for continued success. When created, the Equine Initiative was a commitment by the University of Kentucky's College of Agriculture to provide the same level of excellence in equine as it does in other species and aspects of agriculture. At that time, much noteworthy work was already being done in equine and across many departments. The formation allowed the public access to all of UK's equine programs through one front door. The initiative also was the impetus to add much more. Before the formation of the initiative, a long and storied legacy of world-class equine health and nutrition research was already in place as well as a handful of successful outreach programs targeted to horse owners. But, despite being located in the \"horse capital of the world, \" UK did not have a dedicated undergraduate degree in equine studies. Also, no focal point existed that would allow the public to access all of the topnotch equine efforts in the College. A four-year, stand-alone undergraduate degree in equine science and management was launched, an internship program created, several new equine-focused faculty and staff were hired, and new research and outreach programs were created. 13 One example is the Horse Pasture Evaluation Program, also launched in 2005 as part of the Equine Initiative in an effort to develop stronger ties with Kentucky's equine industry. By the end of 2011, the program had performed more than 100 horse pasture evaluations representing more than 16,000 farm acres in 16 counties. One of the most tangible outcomes of the formation of the initiative is a young and rapidly growing undergraduate degree program. One of only three stand-alone four-year equine degree programs at a land-grant university nationwide, the Equine Science and Management undergraduate degree program now has 220 students, with about half of them coming here to study from out of state. Official graduates total 39, and 94 students had completed their internships by the end of 2011. The University also offers six equine-related clubs and teams, and graduates of this program can move into a number of different graduate degree programs. Organizationally, UK Ag Equine Programs also saw a great deal of change in 2011. Dr. James MacLeod, who had served as director in a 20% capacity and had held the position of Dickson Professor of Equine Science and Management since 2008, tran-sitioned out in April 2011 and was replaced by Dr. Ed Squires, who currently serves in a 40% capacity as director. Squires is a Morgantown, WV , native who received his bach- elor's and master's degrees from West Virginia University and his doctorate in endocrinology and reproductive physiology from the University of Wisconsin. From 1976 to 2008, Squires was a professor in the Department of Biomedical Sciences at Colorado State University, where he was recognized as a distinguished researcher in equine reproduction and a pioneer in developing the techniques of embryo transfer. He came to UK in 2008 as executive director of the UK Gluck Equine Research Foundation and director of advancement and industry relations. He retains that position still. Also of note in 2011 was the announcement of a compre- hensive study of Kentucky's equine industry, the first of its kind conducted in Kentucky since 1977. In order to conduct a comprehensive study of all breeds of horses in all counties of Kentucky, UK Ag Equine Programs is now partnering with the University of Louisville's Equine Business Program and the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) in cooperation with the Kentucky Horse Council and the Kentucky Agricultural Development Fund. The Kentucky Equine Survey will help the state describe the economic impact of the equine industry to Kentucky; quantify the number of horses in the state at the county level; provide information for new and existing businesses; provide better information to help design and implement equine programs benefiting the state; establish a benchmark that will enable the industry to nimbly adapt to changing market conditions; provide better assessment of disease incidence and surveillance; and provide useful data for elected officials. The year 2011 saw the announcement of the project, the formation of partnerships, and the majority of the project's fund-ing secured. UK's College of Agriculture provided $200,000 in seed money. Through the efforts of the Kentucky Horse Council, $300,000 was awarded, with $100,000 of that contingent on the project and its partners raising an additional $100,000 in 2012 from Kentucky's equine industry, which would complete funding of the $600,000 project. Surveys will be mailed to 15,000 horse owners across the state beginning in July 2012. Results will be tabulated and announced by early 2013, with additional economic impact studies to be conducted by the College from that information. Communications for UK Ag Equine Programs also continued to be very active in 2011. Two publications of note for the Equine Initiative include the Bluegrass Equine Digest and the Wildcat Canter. The Bluegrass Equine Digest is a free, monthly online news - letter that covers equine research at UK. It is distributed via TheHorse.com. As of the end of 2011, the digest was distributed to 45,000 people monthly. When more complete metrics were calculated for the September 2011 issue, it was determined that the issue had stories downloaded by readers in all 50 states and in 94 different countries. The publication is just 3 years old. The Wildcat Canter, also online, comes out approximately eight times per year. It began as a student newsletter about student activities. It has evolved into a publication that focuses heavily on student activities and successes within the College's equine programs, and it is read widely by internal and external audiences. Other communications in 2011 included 22 equine-related news releases, an active online and social media presence, a handful of general awareness advertising in equine-specific media, and several equine-related events, both those organized and held by UK Ag Equine Programs and those participated in by its representatives. The program is very active in holding equine events for a variety of stakeholders, and 2011 was no exception. Some of the noteworthy ones included: The third annual Equine Farm and Facilities Expo, an all-equine field day held in Bourbon County on a private Thor - oughbred horse farm (Shawhan Place). The event targeted horse owners and horse farm managers and gave them the opportunity to see a range of equipment and supplies avail-able for horse farms of all sizes. UK specialists also provided hands-on instruction in designing facilities, conducting stra-tegic deworming and spraying, and seeding and mowing pastures. Information booths were also part of the event. Another annual event that has gained a loyal following is \"Pastures Please!\" This event was held again Feb. 1 in Scott County by central Kentucky extension agents. T opics in-cluded equine pasture establishment after a dry summer and fall; potential problems and control of weeds after a dry summer and fall; horse pasture fertilization and other fertil-izer concerns; emerald ash borer; and a roundtable discussion and question-and-answer session. UK instituted a distinguished lecture series in 2009 to high-light important leaders in the equine industry. In 2011, UK hosted both T ed Bassett and Jerry and Ann Moss. T ed Bas - sett's 43-year tenure at the Keeneland Association included positions as president, chairman of the board, and trustee and coincided with the association's greatest period of growth. Jerry and Ann Moss are owners of 2010 Horse of the Y ear and three-time champion older mare Zenyatta. 14 In addition, UK Ag Equine Programs hosted its annual equine career fair, a unique opportunity for equine students to learn more about various equine careers and network for potential internships and with employers and other equine students. It also hosted an inaugural internship appreciation reception to recognize organizations and businesses that have provided internships for UK students and a welcome-back event for equine students to get to know one another and their profes - sors at the start of the fall semester. In addition, UK's Second Annual Kentucky Breeders' Short Course was held in January. Some of the high-profile events attended by the initiative in 2011 included the Rolex 3-Day Event, Hats Off to Kentucky's Horse Industry, and the Alltech National Horse Show, which was held in Lexington for the first time in 2011 in its more than 100-year span. Another notable event participated in during 2011 was the All American Quarter Horse Congress in Columbus, Ohio, in October. UK participated for the first time at this show as part of the Kentucky Equine Higher Education Consortium, a group of eight Kentucky colleges and universities with equine programs that came together to promote Kentucky as the leading destination for equine education in advance of the 2010 Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games. UK remains one of the leaders of the consortium. Other partnerships that UK Ag Equine Programs continued to participate in during 2011 included the Kentucky Equine Networking Association (KENA) and Saddle Up Safely. Program areas of excellence for equine in the College of Agriculture include the following: Maxwell H. Gluck Equine Research Center's development of vaccines against six of the 10 most common equine infectious diseases and active research in six areas of emphasis: genetics and genomics, immunology, infectious diseases, musculo-skeletal science, parasitology, pharmacology/toxicology, and reproductive health The UK Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, which has the highest equine caseload in the world The legacy of the Department of Animal and Food Sciences in nutrition research 4-H and youth programs that reach more than 4,500 Ken-tucky youth each year Horse College, an adult education program reaching more than 1,500 people The UK Horse Pasture Evaluation Program, which, as noted above, has evaluated more than 100 horse farms and 16,000 acres in 16 Kentucky counties Expansion of the concept of Kentucky's horse industry as an economic cluster of businesses and institutions and active research in equine economics Research on horse environments: mud, pervious concrete, stream crossings, and more HorseQuest, a central web-based source for equine informa - tion that is now a community of practice within eXtension UK Research and Education Center at Princeton The University of Kentucky Research and Education Center (UKREC)) holds a unique position as part of the Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station and the Kentucky Coopera - tive Extension Service and remains dedicated to sustaining the heritage of impact and achievement by these great institutions and the rapidly changing issues and challenges associated with them. Its vision is to be recognized at the local, state, and national levels for excellence in agricultural research, education, leader - ship, and service to the Commonwealth. Established in 1925, the West Kentucky Substation at Prince - ton has functioned as a center of agricultural activities in western Kentucky. Great advancements have been made in Kentucky's leading industry\u2014agriculture\u2014with considerable progress being made in improving use and conservation of resources, increasing yields of crops and livestock, better management of capital and labor, expanding markets, and finding solutions for problems facing rural people and communities. Increased returns to Ken- tucky farmers total millions of dollars annually just from the use of new production technologies resulting from research findings and educational programs of the College of Agriculture. The University of Kentucky Research and Education Center is fundamentally interdisciplinary, applying the biological and social sciences to challenges in agricultural, food, and envi-ronmental systems. Our scholarship encompasses human and natural resources and their interaction. As part of the University of Kentucky, the center: Facilitates life-long learning, informed by scholarship and research Expands knowledge through creative research and discovery Serves Kentucky communities by disseminating, sharing, and applying knowledge The UKREC is the headquarters for more than 50 faculty and staff members representing eight different departments in the College. Its faculty and staff conduct research, provide diagnostic testing services, and develop educational programs on topics of concern to Kentucky farmers, agribusinesses, and families. The UKREC Experiment Station Farm consists of almost 1,300 acres, including soils of sandstone and limestone origin that are characteristic of soil types throughout the state. Researchers conduct approximately 100 different research/demonstration projects each year at the experiment station farm or on farms in western Kentucky. Information derived from these projects or research con- ducted elsewhere is delivered to farmers and the general public through county offices of the Cooperative Extension Service. Extension specialists located at the center have expertise in a broad spectrum of food and agriculture topics. Service laboratories located at the center provide information needed to make management decisions in the following areas:15 Soil testing enables farmers to develop nutrient management plans for growing crops. The plant disease diagnostic laboratory helps identify plant health problems and provides recommendations for disease prevention and control. Once insect and plant pests are identified, specialists can give advice on integrated pest management strategies to control them. Crops such as corn, wheat, soybeans, tobacco, fruit, veg-etables, and ornamentals are studied for ways to increase yields and income, improve handling and storage, protect the environment, and address other problems farmers may have. Research and educational programs are also conducted in beef production. A beef herd consisting of 400 animals is involved in many different experiments and demonstrations. Agricultural engineering specialists conduct research and educational programs related to both crop and livestock production. An aquaculture program is conducted in cooperation with Kentucky State University. In addition, the following learning opportunities and re- sources are provided: The Rottering-Kuegel Agricultural Research and Extension Building is available to large and small groups for classes and meetings in agriculture, home economics, and 4-H. It is also used for a wide variety of meetings by government agencies, industry, and the general public. Each year there are approxi-mately 450 different meetings held in this building, attended by about 14,000 people. Many of these visitors come from other states and foreign countries. A biennial field day and other commodity field days, which showcase the work of the center, attract about 3,000 people. Visitors observe research, educational displays, and dem-onstrations representing work conducted at the center and throughout the state. Individuals and small groups are welcome to visit throughout the year to observe specific projects and talk with specialists. 2011 Research Activities Agricultural Engineering Improving energy efficiency in broiler production Energy audits for grain and livestock farms Insects in commercial grain-handling systems Evaluating grain storage systems in West Africa and providing training to facility managers Animal Science The effect of dietary supplementation of selenium in in-organic and organic forms differentially and commonly in altering blood and liver selenium concentrations and liver gene expression profiles of beef cows and their calves Evaluation of a by-product of biodiesel (glycerin) as a feed ingredient Grazing wheat and stockpiled fescue for stocker calves and the effect on subsequent grain yields and compaction Entomology Bt corn variety trials Trials of new insecticides for soybeans Trials of new insecticides for corn Using insect pheromone traps to predict outbreaks Forages Alfalfa persistence Alfalfa variety test Red clover variety test White clover variety test T all fescue variety test Orchardgrass variety test Switchgrass for biofuels Grain Crops Soybean planting date Wheat row spacing Corn population and row spacing study No-till wheat management Soybean management verification program Corn variety trial Wheat variety trial (2) Soybean variety trial T esting of breeding lines Wheat fusarium head blight nursery Canola variety trial Horticulture Nursery/landscape Landscape plant evaluations Landscape plant establishment based on production con-tainer Container type evaluation for sustainable production Efficient fertilization of nursery crops Maintaining water quality and efficient irrigation of nursery crops Kentucky native plant evaluation, production protocols, and use Development and maintenance of Kentucky provenance stock plants Integrated pest management (IPM) monitoring Fruit Rootstock trials: wine grape, production systems Germplasm orchards: pawpaw and pecan Vegetables High-density onion spacing Seedless watermelon variety trial Manure Management and Use Development and implementation of within-production facility (under-slat) manure composting for swine Poultry litter use on soybeans Poultry litter, biosolids, and compost use in winter wheat Plant Pathology Te s t s : Soybean foliar fungicides Wheat foliar fungicides16 National uniform test for integrated control of wheat fu- sarium head blight Soybean variety evaluations for soybean cyst nematode (SCN) Impact of foliar fungicides on reducing yield loss in soybean caused by SCN Impact of fungicide class and timing on deoxynivenol ac - cumulation in wheat grain Impact of tillage on fusarium head blight Fungicide resistance of frogeye leaf spot on soybean Soils High-yield soybean systems (5) Variable rate nitrogen fertilizer applications using remote sensing (3) Efficient use of nitrogen on corn and wheat Tissue nutrient status of winter wheat in Kentucky Influence of grazing winter wheat on yields and soil quality No-till wheat management Using tobacco stalks as a nutrient source Soil compaction Determining the amount of potassium in corn stover in dry falls Additives to improve N efficiency (3) Effect of chicken litter on soybean nutrient uptake and yield Swine Development and evaluation of manure liquid-solid separa-tion system for nursery and finishing swine Evaluation of composting of separated swine manure solids with wood chips Tobacco Variety development: dark and burley tobacco T obacco transplant production management Insecticide performance for tobacco hornworm and bud-worm control Mechanical harvest for tobacco T obacco fertility management Dark fire-curing systems Weed Science Marestail (horseweed) control in wheat Giant ragweed control in wheat Italian ryegrass control in wheat (6 trials) Response of wheat to Osprey and topdressing nitrogen Burndown control of weeds in no-till wheat Weed control in corn with pyroxasulfone premixes (4 trials) Weed control in soybean with pyroxasulfone premixes (2 trials) Weed control Liberty Link soybean Early preplant weed control in soybean (3 trials) Burndown control in no-till corn Impact of row spacing on weed management strategies in corn Impact of row spacing and hybrid on corn yield Palmer amaranth control using soil-residual herbicides (Fulton County) UK Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory Administration Craig N. Carter The University of Kentucky Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (UKVDL) continues to strive to be one of the premier veterinary diagnostic laboratories in the United States, providing timely and accurate services in support of the practicing veterinary profession, Kentucky animal agriculture, the signature equine industries, companion animals, and public health. As the state's flagship veterinary diagnostic laboratory, the UKVDL's primary goal is to develop, apply, and utilize state-of-the-art veterinary diagnostic testing methods and scientific knowledge to improve animal health and marketability, preserve the human-animal bond, and help protect and improve public health through the early and accurate identification of zoonotic diseases. The UKVDL is fully accredited by the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians (AA VLD) and is a mem-ber of the USDA National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) and the FDA Veterinary Laboratory Response Net - work (Vet-LRN). In addition to its clinical diagnostic role, the UKVDL pro- vides surveillance for emerging and endemic diseases such as equine infectious anemia (EIA), equine piroplasmosis, West Nile virus, chronic wasting disease of deer, contagious equine metritis, bovine spongiform encephalitis (mad cow disease), Johne's disease, bovine leukosis, avian influenza, and many other diseases of agricultural, public health, and companion animal importance. Furthermore, the laboratory is always on the watch for the emergence of foreign animal diseases (FADs) such as foot and mouth disease and classical swine fever. In 2011, UKVDL continued its proficiency testing programs as part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network. Farmers and animal owners use the UKVDL's services through their practicing veterinarians. These professionals have expertise in selecting, preparing, shipping, and submitting the proper specimens for testing when needed to assist in making a clinical diagnosis. Laboratory findings are reported back to the submitting veterinarian, who then consults with his or her clients to implement a treatment protocol or a preventive solution for disease problems on the farm. UKVDL faculty, scientists, and technical staff are specialists in several diagnostic medical disciplines directly related to animal health, including bacteriology, clinical pathology, epidemiology, extension, molecular biology, pathology, serology, toxicology, virology, and informatics. Disease diagnostic efforts are coordi- nated and handled by specialists in the appropriate disciplines. Complex clinical cases involving multiple sections are monitored by highly qualified case coordinators. The UKVDL is organized into sections so that specialized workload/activities can be handled efficiently.17 The UKVDL received 54,939 cases (a 3.4% increase from cal- endar year 2010; the overall linear trend line is increasing as well), including 4,128 necropsies (a 28.3% increase from calendar year 2010; much of this increase can be attributed to the outbreak of nocardioform placentitis). The increase in caseload and necropsy procedures is encouraging in light of current economic condi-tions. T otal tests run in each laboratory section will be listed in the individual section reports. Outreach: The UKVDL continues to build and enhance outreach programs around Kentucky. The Kentucky VetLabNet listserv continues to distribute animal health bulletins and has grown to a list of almost 650 UKVDL clients, scientists, farmers, and stakeholders. Several research visits were conducted by the epi-demiology section on Kentucky farms, including visits to UK's C. Oran Little Research Center for animal research in Woodford County as part of a Department of Homeland Security research project. The UKVDL director continues to contribute articles quarterly to the Kentucky Veterinary Medication Association's newsletter, Kentucky Veterinary News, and the Kentucky Cattle- man Association's Cow Country News. The UKVDL director, faculty, and staff continue to deliver lectures at scientific and lay meetings and have participated in the monthly Equine Diagnostic-Research Seminar Series at the UKVDL since 2006. Personnel Actions: The following key positions were filled: Head, Diagnostic Microbiology, Dr. Erdal Erol Pathology, Research Animal, Dr. Kathyrn \"Casey\" Coyle Pathology Veterinary T echnician, Judy T ucker Account Clerk II, Michelle Cooper Account Clerk III, Christina Kane Business Office Manager, Ryan Redimarker Histology Section Chief, Jamie Howard IT Specialist, Derrick Miles T oxicology T echnician, Michelle Helm Two key technician positions were converted from STEPS to fully-budgeted positions in the Molecular Biology Section: Senior T echnician, Ashley Skillman Senior T echnician, Naomi Meyer-Kelly 2011 Highlights: Served as the UKVDL key construction liaison person to the construction manager of UK's capital project manage-ment division, College of Agriculture engineers, and other key players. Oversaw successful completion of the UKVDL expansion/renovation, including coordination of the final move into the new facilities in May. Participated in planning and execution of the new facility's dedication ceremony in May, including hosting Jane Beshear, First Lady of Kentucky. The UKVDL was accepted as a full member of the FDA 's Vet - erinary Laboratory Response Network (VetLRN) in October. As part of the VetLRN, UKVDL personnel will be trained and equipped to conduct laboratory testing in support of surveillance for and response to animal health problems related to feeds. The UKVDL is now the home for research animal pathology for the UK community, an initiative that was completed in 2011. We are fortunate as part of this administrative change to also welcome two new members to our pathology team. Dr. Kathryn (Casey) Coyle is the research animal pathologist for UK and came to UK from the University of Wisconsin. She completed her pathology residency at the University of Minnesota and the University of Wisconsin. During and after her residency, she was one of the pathologists for the Milwaukee County Zoo and worked as a pathologist at the National Wildlife Health Laboratory in Madison. She was also one of the research animal pathologists for the University of Wisconsin, which has one of the largest animal health re-search programs in the country. Judy T ucker is the pathology veterinary technician. She received her training at Murray State University and is a certified veterinary technician. In addition to her duties in research animal pathology, she is assisting in the UKVDL clinical pathology laboratory.

He will serve as immediate past president for 2012. Dr. Carter is also executive director of the World Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosti- cians. He is currently planning for a scientific symposium on diagnostic veterinary medicine and an Office Internationale 18Epizootique (OIE) session in Berlin, Germany, that is sched- uled for June 2013. Dr. Carter received the K.F. Meyer-James Steele Gold Headed Cane Award in Epidemiology at the American Veterinary Medical Association meeting in St. Louis in July. Finally, he continues to serve on the OIE Expert Committee for Reference Laboratories and Collaborating Centers in Paris, France. Bacteriology/Mycology Erdal Erol The primary mission of the bacteriology/mycology section of the UKVDL is to detect or isolate and identify pathogenic bac - teria or fungi present in animals in order to assist veterinarians and farmers in the diagnosis and treatment of disease processes. The section also determines the antibiotics that might be used for the treatment of specific bacterial infections and is responsible for culture of T aylorella equigenitalis and T. asinigenitalis for the federal/state (CEM) regulatory program in equine. 2011 Highlights: The major tests are highlighted in the table below. Aerobic cultures totaling 10,095 were performed on samples submit - ted to the UKVDL; significant bacterial pathogens were found in these samples, such as Nocardioform equines in Kentucky were cultured for CEM organisms. With the exception of one case in which T. asinigenitalis was isolated, all horses tested were negative. Because four positive stallions were detected by this section in late 2008, we continue to receive a high number of samples. Early detection of this infection in the Quarter Horse popula-tion by this laboratory prevented this disease from becoming more widespread in U.S. equine populations. A new antimicrobial susceptibility system that utilizes the broth microdilution method has been implemented. This system now allows us to perform antibiotic susceptibility on many more microorganisms, including Nocardioform bacteria, anaerobic bacteria, and some fungi. 2,638 different bacterial isolates were tested to determine the best antibiotics for treatment of these microorganisms in exposed animals. 607 milk samples from dairy cows were tested for micro-organisms that cause mastitis; over 50% were positive for pathogenic microorganisms. The laboratory section has significant collaboration within the UK College of Agriculture, such as with the Gluck Equine Research Center (Dr. Troedsson, Nocardioform placentitis research) and the UK Department of Animal and Food Sci- ences (Dr. Jeffrey Bewley, mastitis study) and with outside insitutions, such as Pfizer (antimicrobial susceptibility) and the University of Difficile Toxin A/B 25 Culture-Listeria 24 We have established a protocol to identify Salmonella bacteria in poultry following the National Poultry Improvement plan (NPIP) protocol and now provide service for the poultry industry for Salmonella culture following NPIP protocol. We continued Leptospirosis and Salmonella real-time PCR assay projects. We engaged in research activity on the antimicrobial suscep-tibility patterns of yeasts in horses. Clinical Pathology Bonnie L. Decker The primary mission of the clinical pathology section is to provide chemistry, hematology, endocrine, urinalysis, fluid analysis, fecal parasite exams, and other testing to animal own-ers, veterinarians, and the agriculture community. The section also provides support and testing to UKVDL's pathologists and testing related to necropsy. In addition, University of Kentucky equine and animal science researchers can submit specimens to the clinical pathology section for monitoring various chemistry, hematology, and endocrine levels in their research animals. In 2011 this section moved into a new, larger facility that al- lowed the department to spread out and be more efficient. The new facility also allows for continued growth of the department. More tests are being brought in for 2012 to provide equine vet - erinarians with more diagnostic information. The section completes its testing the same day as receipt with a few exceptions. Cryptosporidium and protein electrophoresis require more time and are reported within five working days of receipt. Progesterones and Canine TSH must be in the depart - ment by 2 p.m. for same-day turnaround. The department personnel consist of 1.50 FTE. A section chief with a BS MT (ASCP) and 34 years' experience in veteri-nary and human diagnostic laboratory testing works full time, and a veterinary technician with 15 years' experience works part time. Other qualified UKVDL personnel volunteer to provide additional technical assistance as needed in the laboratory dur - ing surge periods and as backup. Faculty and professional staff assist with diagnostic consultations. The clinical pathology section is dedicated to meeting the current and future needs of the agriculture and companion animal communities and veterinarians. 192011 Highlights: Moved into new laboratory with expanded workspace and facilities Increased the number of tests run by 29% as compared to 2010 Increased variety of tests run Increased percentages of small animal tests run compared to 2010 Epidemiology Jacqueline L. Smith The UKVDL epidemiology section plans and conducts veterinary epidemiological research experiments that lead to the earliest detection of animal disease outbreaks. Our primary mission is to provide animal disease surveillance and assist vet - erinarians in the investigation of serious and unusual disease problems. Daily monitoring of finalized necropsy and lab testing data streams provide near real-time disease cluster analysis. The section also conducts data acquisition and statistical analysis in support of the Office of the State Veterinarian and the USDA and to provide animal health situational awareness for industry stakeholders. Many of these studies lead to publication in peer-reviewed journals and lay publications. Disease reporting to the state veterinarian (reportable infectious diseases, diseases of interest, emergency disease notification) is performed weekly for the typical endemic diseases, while unusual or emergency disease situations are reported immediately. Also available are in-depth field investigations to better characterize disease out - breaks for identifying causative etiology through the collection of diagnostic specimens and recommendations for diagnostic testing. These investigations are provided free of charge to any farm/producer in the state of Kentucky at the request of a local client with the approval of the UKVDL administration. 2011 Highlights: 21 research farm visits (UK beef unit) for National Institute for Hometown Security (NIHS) Project 124 hours in research visit time 2 surveys National equine leptospirosis seroepidemiological study Kentucky equine nocardioform placentitis farm study 216 telephone consults asking for suggestions, recommenda-tions, and questions related to animal health issues 59 statistical requests (from UKVDL faculty, state and federal officials, local veterinarians, and other UK faculty) fulfilled, 1-10 hours each 63 graphics requests fulfilled, 2-10 hours each 52 weekly reportable disease reports sent, at approximately 1 hour each New GIS software implemented, allowing state and national level maps to be quickly generated and ready for dissemina-tion via email, web, or print Research Projects in Progress: Continuous health monitoring of cattle: Dr. Craig Carter, Jackie Smith Animal disease cluster detection: Dr. Craig Carter, Jackie Smith Mobile wireless and remote diagnostic computer applica - tions: Dr. Craig Carter, Dr. Wade Northington, Dr. Michelle Bilderback, Dr. Cindy Gaskill, Jackie Smith, and Jacki Cassady U.S. leptospirosis sero-epidemiological survey: Dr. Craig Carter, Dr. Noah Cohen, Jackie Smith, Meg Steinman, and Dr. Erdal Erol Molecular Diagnostics Erdal Erol/Stephen Sells Diagnostic PCR assays are being increasingly utilized because of their speed and specificity. T ests based on nucleic acid are now used so that unknown organisms can be identified, closely related organisms can be differentiated, and small numbers of pathogens can be detected in complex samples. Specimens such as blood, swabs, washes, and feces are accepted directly from clinicians. This section of the laboratory also analyzes specimens received from the pathology, virology, and bacteriology sections of this and other diagnostic facilities. 2011 Highlights: This section continues to be responsible for providing the majority of Kentucky's arbovirus (mosquito-borne virus) testing as part of an environmental risk analysis program with the Kentucky Department for Human Health. Working with the new head of UKVDL microbiology, this section has developed standardized protocols for new di- agnostic assays, which are now offered as a service to our large and small animal practitioners. These tests are rapid, sensitive, diagnostic PCR tests for canine influenza virus, equine influenza virus, Clostridium addition, the methodology of the assays for equine herpesvirus types 1 and 4 and Mycobacterium paratuberculosis was converted from traditional qualitative gel based PCR to real-time PCR, allowing for the addition of a quantitative estimation of those pathogens when detected. Approximately 6,000 specimens were submitted for PCR testing in 500 accessioned cases. The most requested tests included leptospira (1,640), equine herpesvirus type Po - tomac Horse Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) (31 accessions), Moraxella bovis (9), EHV5 (83), and EHV2 (86). In cooperation with researchers at Michigan State University, the normal flora of the male genital tract of donkeys is being determined. An important preliminary finding of this study is that T aylorella asinigenitalis, one of the bacteria causing contagious equine metritis, is sometimes a part of the normal flora of male donkeys and that it can persist for at least 12 months in these animals. An investigation was undertaken with researchers at the Gluck Equine Research Center to determine if the treatment of semen with antibiotics will prevent the transmission of T. equigenitalis to mares bred by artificial insemination. Pre- liminary results indicated that the antibiotics did prevent the transmission of the disease. 20Pathology Neil M. Williams The pathology section is composed of eight faculty patholo- gists, four post-doctoral scholars (pathology residents), four histology technicians, four full-time necropsy technicians, and two part-time necropsy student workers. The pathologists per - form complete necropsy examinations on submitted animals, histopathology on necropsy cases and surgical biopsies, and cy - tological examinations. They are supported by the other section personnel. As part of the comprehensive necropsy examination, additional laboratory tests are ordered by the pathologist to aid in confirming a diagnosis. The abnormal findings on necropsy are correlated with other laboratory tests, including microscopic examination of the tissues, and a comprehensive report is pre-pared for every pathology case. Post-doctoral (DVM) scholars are trained in veterinary anatomic pathology. Necropsy: A postmortem examination (necropsy) is con-ducted to identify any pathologic changes in the tissues that would indicate disease, injury, or any other abnormal process resulting in illness. Total Necropsy Cases 4,128 a Avian 77 Bovine 763 Caprine 81 Equine 1919 Ovine 88 Porcine 20 Small Animal 802 Miscellaneous 45 Laboratory Animal 333 a 28% increase over 2010. Histopathology: Tissues are prepared and processed to produce glass slides for microscopic examination conducted by the pathologists. Tissues from the necropsy and surgical biopsy cases were processed, and 34,619 microscopic slides produced. In addition to the routine hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections, special and immunohistochemical stains were done, resulting in 3,511 slides produced for the purpose of identifying microscopic organisms/agents that may cause disease or tissue antigens that define or identify cell structures. Biopsy: Abnormal areas or lesions are often removed surgi-cally or a portion biopsied from live animals and sent to the labo - ratory for determination of the type of process, recommended treatment, and potential prognosis. These tissue specimens are processed, and microscopic slides prepared for the pathologists to examine by microscopy. Tissue specimens representing 3,619 cases were processed and examined. A report with diagnosis was produced for each case. Cytology: Preparations of cells harvested from abnormal lesions or abnormal fluids are placed on microscopic slides and stained for examination under the microscope by the pa-thologists. Cytopathological examinations were performed, a diagnosis made, and a report generated for 456 cases.Pathology, Research Animal Kathyrn (Casey) Coyle The research animal pathology section sees mostly small rodents with occasional dogs, rabbits, nonhuman primates, and pigs. Submissions from research animals during 2011 totaled over 300, including clinical pathology samples, biopsies, and necropsies. In addition to research animal work, Dr. Coyle is handling the diagnostic pathology caseload for the agricultural research animals housed at the various UK farms. Dr. Coyle also provides pathology support for several research projects for individual UK investigators. Quality Control/Quality Assurance Mary Harbour The goal of the quality control/quality assurance section is continuous quality improvement of service to veterinarians, animal owners, and other clients in the animal industry. An addi-tional goal of this program is to ensure the quality, accuracy, and timeliness of all test results. This section monitors test results, quality control results, and proficiency testing. The program is based on American Association of Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (AA VLD) requirements, International Standards Organization (ISO 17025) guidelines, and standards of the Organization of International Epizootics (OIE). The UKVDL Quality Control/Quality Assurance Program also fulfills the University's mission of improving service delivery while achiev - ing excellent human relations (internally and externally), sound leadership, and effective communications. The requirements for maintaining the quality system and management are continuously being updated. The quality as - surance manager attended quality assurance and quality man- agement training sponsored by the USDA National Animal Health Laboratory Network in Ames, IA, and workshops at the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians (AA VLD) annual meeting. Internal section audits are conducted throughout the year in preparation for the next AA VLD accredi-tation visit. Besides the continuous improvement of service, the section continues to revise and improve in procedures and policies to remain in compliance with the AA VLD accreditation require-ments. In addition, the section has assisted in implementing all policies and procedures required by National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) and the Veterinary Laboratory Response Network (Vet-LRN), including providing documenta-tion, proficiency testing, and participating in workshops. Ruminant Extension L. Michelle Arnold The ruminant extension veterinarian is charged with improving the status of ruminant health by establishing and maintaining in-formation flow among all the stakeholders in the livestock industry. This goal is accomplished through open communication with food animal veterinarians, county extension personnel, producers, state and federal authorities, and University faculty and staff in a progres - sive and responsive manner. Current health topics including disease risk and occurrence, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and control 21form the core of the information disseminated. New knowledge generated at the University level, governmental directives, and other stakeholder contributions are also gathered centrally and then communicated openly for discussion and action, ultimately benefiting producers throughout Kentucky. 2011 Highlights: Developed and presented the herd health portion of the new Master Stocker Program in seven regions of the state, impacting approximately 200 farming operations. Updated and presented the herd health portion of Master Cattlemen in seven regions, directly affecting approximately 300 farming enterprises Held two food animal veterinary conferences at the UKVDL, which were well-attended and received good reviews. These conferences were offered at no cost to the veterinarians through the generous support of sponsoring pharmaceuti-cal companies Co-sponsored the small ruminant grazing conference in Elizabethtown, which drew 86 participants. This conference moves to a different location in Kentucky each year in order to reach sheep and goat producers in all areas of the state. Continued to utilize the latest technology (Microsoft\u00ae Lync ) to deliver meetings remotely over the Internet, resulting in significant savings in travel expenditures. Began to integrate the T urning Point\u00ae technology into PowerPoint presentations so the audience can answer questions with handheld clickers Participated in numerous field days, producer meetings, and farm visits throughout the state to educate producers as well as identify the scope of existing problems and find ways to promote positive change Continued a strong working relationship with veterinarians of the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), fostering cooperation, trust, and a bi-directional flow of information between the University and federal au-thorities. This relationship included integration of continuing education modules for federal accreditation into our continu- ing education programs. Worked closely with the state veterinarian's office to suc - cessfully implement state initiatives. This effort included cooperation to institute the new animal disease traceability regulations and also formulate the livestock care standards for Kentucky. Worked collaboratively with Purdue University, Kentucky State University, and Berea College on multiple small rumi-nant projects and meetings. Many of these meetings were delivered electronically with open access to the presentations and potentially reached a wide audience. Involvement as co-investigator on a grant from the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) to help food animal veterinarians make diagnostic decisions in the field Research of critical problems unique to our state is part of the agenda as the University continues on a path of academic excellence. T oward that end, a research study is in progress to assess trace mineral levels in grazing meat goats. Preliminary results suggest a definite trend of marginal to deficient status, which we are currently addressing. Completed a database of food animal veterinarians that will allow rapid communication in the event of an animal emergency situation or disease outbreak. This database is continually updated with email addresses and cell phone numbers to enhance the speed of communication. Worked with dairy extension to deliver Project Reduce So- matic Cell Count in seven regions to help dairy producers deal with new regulations imposed by milk processors. This effort resulted in a co-authored Cooperative Extension publication Staphylococcus aureus Mastitis (ID-190). Regularly contributed health-related articles for the Ag Exten-sion newsletters Off the Hoof, Kentucky Dairy Notes, and the Goat Producer's Newsletter Submitted material from the Kentucky Veterinary Medical Association (KVMA) to the Kentucky Veterinary News and the veterinary listserv distributed by the diagnostic labora- tory. Spoke at the KVMA Mid-America Veterinary Confer - ence on the topic \"What Can Extension Do for Y ou?\" Researched and provided numerous publications and Pow - erPoint presentations to veterinarians throughout the state to deliver at local producer meetings Kentucky veterinarians, extension agents, producers, gov - ernment entities, and the University benefit from a strong livestock sector, of which health is a major consideration. In 2011, this position served to reach each of these stakeholders for the overall improvement of livestock health and sustain- ability of the food animal veterinary profession. Serology Meg Steinman The mission of the serology section is to provide accurate and timely results for both diagnostic and regulatory testing. The results generated provide veterinarians and regulatory per - sonnel with data upon which to base their decisions regarding animal health. This section also performs testing for movement of animals within the United States and for international export purposes. T esting is done by a variety of methods. This section performs a wide range of tests; the tests and numbers listed below are just a sampling of what we offer. 2011 Highlights: Poultry: Continued to pass annual inspections and maintain status as a National Poultry Improvement Plan (NPIP) approved laboratory Personnel attended NPIP-approved training courses on avian influenza and Salmonella testing T ested 4,120 samples for antibody to avian influenza, 13,045 samples for antibody to Salmonella pullorum, and 16,876 samples for antibody to both Mycoplasma gallesepticum and Mycoplasma synoviae Equine: Successfully passed the annual USDA-APHIS (Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service) inspection to continue to offer equine infectious anemia (EIA) antibody testing and ran 25,386 EIA tests in 2011 Continued to monitor horses moving through the state stock - yards for EIA antibody, testing 11,438 specimens at no charge22 Passed the required proficiency testing of the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) for piroplasmosis testing (Babesia caballi and Theileria pomona by the microscopic agglutination titer (MAT) method. In addition, 1,497 sera from 29 states in the United States and Ontario, Canada, were tested for six lepto serovars as part of a national sero-epidemiological survey. Results will be published in 2012. Bovine: Offering a variety of antibody tests that can be performed on serum from bovines and other ruminant species, in 2011 this section tested 321 specimens for anaplasmosis, 380 specimens for antibody to bluetongue, 469 specimens for antibodies to the bovine leukemia virus, 1,584 serums for Johne's antibodies, 732 specimens for antibody to Neospora caninum , and 2,553 sera in Bru- cella abortus. Canine and Feline: Provided a variety of tests that can be run on dogs and cats, including 160 tests for antibodies to histoplasmosis, 197 for antibodies to blastomyces, and 95 for canines for antibody to Brucella canis. These numbers are just a sampling of the tests we run for these species. Porcine: Provided testing for swine, with 51 samples tested for pseu-dorabies and Brucella antibodies. Toxicology Cynthia L. Gaskill The primary mission of the toxicology section at the UKVDL is to provide toxicological diagnostic testing capabilities and consultations to Kentucky veterinarians, UKVDL pathologists and pathology residents, county extension agents, livestock producers, and pet owners. A large variety of toxicological tests are available, including assays for metals and minerals; tests for organic compounds including a multitude of pesticides, drugs, and other chemicals; tests for biological toxins such as plant toxins, toxic insects, and bacterial and fungal toxins; and tests for numerous other toxins. T ests are performed in tissues, gas - trointestinal contents, biological fluids, baits, feed, water, soil, and other substances. Consultation services include assistance with appropriate sample collection and submission recommendations, deter - mination of appropriate tests to be performed, interpretation of analytical results, therapeutic advice, differential diagnoses, residue considerations, and other general toxicological informa- tion. The section personnel consist of Cynthia Gaskill, DVM PhD, clinical veterinary toxicologist; Lori Smith, PhD, senior analytical chemist; Michelle Helm, BSc, chemist/technician; and several student interns.2011 Highlights: Hosted student interns for the forensic science internship program at Eastern Kentucky University Provided analytical support for the University of Kentucky Horse Pasture Evaluation Program Acquired LC-MS/MS instrumentation through an instru-ment sharing agreement with the USDA Agricultural Research Service Forage Animal Production Research Unit Continued development and validation of new diagnostic tests Participated in a number of proficiency testing programs to ensure accuracy and quality control for analytical methods Participated in the UKVDL veterinary pathology training program, providing lectures on veterinary toxicology and analytical chemistry topics to pathology residents The section participated in several research projects that are directly applicable to improvements in diagnostic offerings.
