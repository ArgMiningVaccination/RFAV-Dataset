The National Academy of Medicine, formerly known as the Institute of Medicine, conducted a study on the safety of eight vaccines given to children and adults. With a few exceptions, the review showed that these immunizations are quite safe. A Centre for Disease Control (CDC) study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is added to the growing body of evidence suggesting immunizations do not cause autism. This study looked at how many antigens were delivered throughout the first two years of life. Antigens are components of vaccinations that stimulate the immune system to manufacture disease-fighting antibodies. The findings revealed that children with ASD and children without ASD received the same total quantity of antigen from immunizations. Thimerosal is one of the vaccine ingredients that have been investigated in specifically. Thimerosal is a mercury-based preservative that is used to keep germs (such as bacteria and fungus) out of vaccine multi dose vials. Thimerosal does not cause ASD, according to the study. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) determined scientific study that \"the evidence favors rejection of a causal link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.\" Despite the overwhelming evidence that vaccines are safe and effective, some parents choose to avoid or postpone vaccinations for their children. However, because vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, polio this is exceedingly dangerous. If an unvaccinated child contracts one of these avoidable diseases, he or she, as well as those around him or her, could become very sick or even die. We think autism manifests has vastly improved, and people who would not have been considered autistic earlier may now be diagnosed with one of the multiple ASDs. Autism rates have risen substantially in developing countries during the last 20 years. [Autism](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/autism-3955.html) spectrum disease affects roughly 1 in 150 children born in 1992, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). An ASD diagnosis would be given to around one out of every 68 children born in 2004. The incidence was 1 in 44 for children born in 2010. Because [autism](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/autism-3955.html) was linked mostly with seriously damaged individuals in earlier years, and the rate of [autism](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/autism-3955.html) was considered to be only about 1 in 10,000, comparing [autism](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/autism-3955.html) rates from the 1990s and later with rates from the 1940s through the 1980s is challenging. Despite the fact that children immunization rates are still high, some parents are concerned that vaccines may cause autism. Three theories have been proposed: (1) the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine causes autism by damaging the intestinal lining, allowing encephalopathy proteins to enter; (2) thimerosal, an ethyl mercury-containing preservative in some vaccines, is toxic to the central nervous system; and (3) the simultaneous administration of multiple vaccines overwhelms or weakens the immune system. We'll go over the origins of each of these beliefs as well as the epidemiological evidence supporting them. Concerns that an environmental exposure such as vaccines can cause [autism](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/autism-3955.html) have grown as the rate of [autism](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/autism-3955.html) diagnoses has risen around the world, owing to broader diagnostic criteria and increasing awareness. The Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccination, thimerosal, and the enormous number of vaccines now in use have all been blamed for this alleged link. It has been refuted by epidemiological and biological investigations. Citation: Killwed F (2022) Relation between Vaccines and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Autism Open Access. 12:318.
