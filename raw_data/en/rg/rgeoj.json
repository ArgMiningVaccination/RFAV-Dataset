A new chemical platform was designed based on branched piperazine-2,5-diones for creating orally available biologically active peptidomimetics. The platform includes a bio-carrier with \"built-in\" functionally active peptide fragments or bioactive molecules that are covalently attached via linkers. The developed platform allows for a small peptide to be taken with a particular biological activity and to be transformed into an orally stable compound displaying the same activity. Based on this approach, various peptidomimetics exhibiting hemostimulating, hemosuppressing, and adjuvant activity were prepared. In addition, new examples of a rare phenomenon when enantiomeric molecules demonstrate reciprocal biological activity are presented. Finally, the review summarizes the evolutionary approach of the short peptide pharmaceutical development from the immunocompetent organ separation to orally active cyclopeptides and peptidomimetics.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-08-31", "cleaned_text": "Advancement from Small Peptide Pharmaceuticals to Orally Active Piperazine-2,5-dion-Based Cyclopeptides [https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241713534](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241713534) [New the Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-ijms-24-13534)]. The versatility of peptide functions in humans has made it possible, based on endogenous molecules and their modified analogs, to develop peptide pharmaceuticals for various indications, from oncology to dentistry [ [2](#B2-ijms-24-13534)]. In addition, natural peptides regulate emotional states, sexual behavior, sleep, wakefulness, and immune response. Modern technologies are used to isolate, synthesize, and study human, animal, and plant peptides as therapeutic agent candidates [ [3](#B3-ijms-24-13534)]. [3](#B3-ijms-24-13534), [4](#B4-ijms-24-13534), [5](#B5-ijms-24-13534), [6](#B6-ijms-24-13534)], there are only eight pharmaceuticals based on various cyclopeptides that are approved for medical use [ [7](#B7-ijms-24-13534)], and not a single drug containing a 2,5-DKP derivative. [8](#B8-ijms-24-13534)], have described the activities of approved low-molecular-weight peptide drugs. [9](#B9-ijms-24-13534), [10](#B10-ijms-24-13534)]. Since the 1960s, in the \"pre-omics era,\" the central organs of the animal immune system (bone marrow, thymus, and spleen) have attracted researchers' attention as a source of biologically active compounds affecting the immune system. As far back as the middle of the last century, researchers suggested that some peptides may work as the immune system's \"hormones\". They discovered that the bone marrow, thymus, and spleen are the primary producers of such immune \"hormones\" [ [11](#B11-ijms-24-13534)]. In addition, some peptides participate in the maturation and differentiation of hematopoietic and immunocompetent cells [ [12](#B12-ijms-24-13534)]. [13](#B13-ijms-24-13534)]. In the following decades, several active peptides such as thymopoietin, splenopoietin, and thymulin isolated from thymic and spleen extracts were used in clinical practice as immunocorrecting agents [ [14](#B14-ijms-24-13534)]. 2. Thymus-Derived exploring the active E-rosette test (Ea-RFU) [ [15](#B15-ijms-24-13534)]. The peptides isolated from the thymus and various synthetic isomers and analogs were used for structure-functional (SAR) studies [ [17](#B17-ijms-24-13534), [18](#B18-ijms-24-13534), [19](#B19-ijms-24-13534), [20](#B20-ijms-24-13534), [21](#B21-ijms-24-13534)]. It is known that thymocyte treatment via trypsin results in the hydrolysis of most of the surface erythrocyte E-receptors of a ship or rabbit. As a result, the percentage of T-lymphocytes detected in the Ea\u2014RFU test decreases. Adding the thymus peptide fractions or individual peptides (thymosin alpha 1) to the thymocyte culture promotes the regeneration and rapid recovery of E-receptors on trypsin-treated T-lymphocytes. The influence of peptides on the regeneration process of thymocyte E-receptors treated with trypsin was determined. Only Glu-Trp (Thymogen) was used as a leading compound for further experimental and clinical studies. The specific and general pharmacological activities of Thymogen were assessed in various experimental models [ [21](#B21-ijms-24-13534), [22](#B22-ijms-24-13534), [23](#B23-ijms-24-13534), [24](#B24-ijms-24-13534), [25](#B25-ijms-24-13534)]. the case of Thymogen, it targets the promoter regions of the DNA double helix in lymphocyte cells. It is assumed that such binding transforms the \"silent\" heterochromatin into active euchromatin, which increases the availability of respective genes for transcription [ [19](#B19-ijms-24-13534)]. Subsequently, dipeptide GluTrp displayed a broad range of immunopotentiation effects and, after preclinical and clinical studies, was registered in 1990 as a drug Thymogen in the USSR (now in the Russian Federation) (Russian Ministry of Health Registration Certificate P N002408/01 from 10 June 2009). 2.3. Second Generation: Stemokin [27](#B27-ijms-24-13534), [28](#B28-ijms-24-13534)]. Given the close interaction of the hematopoiesis and immune system [ [29](#B29-ijms-24-13534)] consisting of a common ancestral cell and for the regulation of specific processes of hematopoiesis by immunocompetent cells, it was of particular interest to study the possibility of using short peptides to reduce the damaging effect of ionizing radiation on hemopoiesis, particularly on the undeveloped CFU cell population [ [19](#B19-ijms-24-13534)]. The impact of Ile-Glu-Trp was compared with the Granocyte (colony-stimulating factor G-CSF) on hematopoietic cells after a higher irradiation dose of 7 Gy. On the 14th day after irradiation, both the peripheral and initial departments of hemopoiesis in the treated groups were recovered. Under the influence of Ile-Glu-Trp, by day 14, the volume of the CFU pool increased by 2.5 times. By day 21 after irradiation, none of the experimental groups showed a significant difference in the cellular composition of peripheral blood from the intact control. Currently, in the bone marrow, the volume of the CFU pool in mice treated with Ile-Glu-Trp is completely restored, significantly outperforming the group treated with G-CSF, in which the amount of CFU was two times less than in the intact control. Thus, the restoration of hematopoiesis in irradiated mice (7 Gy) under the influence of Ile-Glu-Trp and G-CSF is observed from the 14th day, which is much earlier than in the control group. In addition, Ile-Glu-Trp restored the total amount of bone marrow cell faster than the G-CSF group. Moreover, the cellularity volume in the Ile-Glu-Trp-treated group was completely recovered two times more intensively than in the group treated with G-CSF [ [30](#B30-ijms-24-13534)]. [31](#B31-ijms-24-13534)]. Based on the preclinical and clinical studies, the peptide Ile-Glu-Trp was registered in Russia as a drug named Stemokin (Russian Ministry of Health Registration Certificate LCP-003014/09 from 16 April 2009). 2.4. Third Generation: Thymodepressin [16](#B16-ijms-24-13534)]. [31](#B31-ijms-24-13534)]. A systemic study of Thymodepressin in cell cultures and animal models concluded that bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors are the primary target of its action [ [32](#B32-ijms-24-13534)]. 2.4.1. Thymodepressin Influences the Development of Hemopoietic Precursor Cells 2.4.2. Thymodepressin Effects on Hemopoiesis and Immunity [34](#B34-ijms-24-13534)]. Thymodepressin, both in vitro and in vivo, affects the initial stages of hemopoiesis, reducing the number of committed (CFU-C-8 and CFU-GM) cells and the percentage of cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle. As a result, the administration of the peptide leads to a dose-dependent transient decrease in the number of leucocytes in the blood of the experimental animal. The primary method used to prove this mechanism of action was applied compared to the sensitivity of normal mouse bone marrow cells [ [33](#B33-ijms-24-13534)]. In addition, a direct measurement of the radiation allows one to correctly measure the percentage of dividing cells (in the S phase of the cell cycle) [ [33](#B33-ijms-24-13534)]. - - - The peptide D-Glu(D-Trp)-OH inhibits the migration of CD34+ cells from the bone marrow into peripheral blood in normal and tumor-bearing animals [ [31](#B31-ijms-24-13534)]. Injecting this peptide into donor mice two days before irradiation or the exposure to the cytostatic cytosine arabinoside (cytosar) D-Glu(D-Trp)-OH protected the population of hematopoietic progenitor cells and promotes more intensive restoration than the control group [ [32](#B32-ijms-24-13534)]. - - - A direct suppression of the autoimmune reaction in the mice models by the peptide D-Glu(D-Trp)-OH more effectively prevented and treated the developed autoimmune reactions when directly compared with Cyclosporin [ [32](#B32-ijms-24-13534)]. - - - Therefore, after preclinical and clinical studies, the peptide D-Glu(D-Trp-OH) was registered in the Russian Federation as a drug named Thymodepressin\u00ae (Russian Ministry of Health Registration Certificate LCP-001836/08 17 March 2008). The immuno-inhibiting properties of this unnatural iso-peptide were in demand in medicine. Currently, Thymodepressin is actively used in clinical practice for the treatment of autoimmune and allergic processes caused by lymphocyte-mediated hyperimmune 3. Toward a Fourth Generation of Glu-Trp Family Peptide Pharmaceuticals 3.1. Discovery of the Reciprocal Activities of Glu-Trp Family Peptides [10](#B10-ijms-24-13534), [21](#B21-ijms-24-13534)]. [10](#B10-ijms-24-13534)]. D-Glu-D-Trp-OH and D-Glu(D-Trp)-OH peptides' surprising activities were further investigated. Therefore, a comprehensive range of experiments was carried out in various conditions and doses of Thymodepressin in combination with and without cytostatic and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation [ of increasing the enzymatic stability of peptide molecules is to introduce elements with a cyclic structure that is resistant to proteolytic degradation [ [37](#B37-ijms-24-13534), [38](#B38-ijms-24-13534)]. Many laboratories worldwide are developing peptide modification strategies to increase the stability and affinity to receptors or active enzyme centers [ [42](#B42-ijms-24-13534), [43](#B43-ijms-24-13534), [44](#B44-ijms-24-13534), [45](#B45-ijms-24-13534)]. (2,5-diketopiperazines (DKPs), which [46](#B46-ijms-24-13534)]. [46](#B46-ijms-24-13534), [47](#B47-ijms-24-13534), [48](#B48-ijms-24-13534), [49](#B49-ijms-24-13534)]. An approach the use of 2,5-DKPs, both in short peptide analogs and in the form of \"inserts\" at different positions of the peptide chain, has become widespread to increase their hydrolytic stability and the possibility of oral administration. Several cyclopeptides are approved for clinical use as peroral medications [ [47](#B47-ijms-24-13534), [48](#B48-ijms-24-13534), [49](#B49-ijms-24-13534)]. [Figure 1](#ijms-24-13534-f001)). These derivatives of the 2,5-DKP consist of a trifunctional amino acid containing various functional groups, which can be used to identify target positions for interaction or as linkers for attaching multiple pharmacophores [ [50](#B50-ijms-24-13534)]. [39](#B39-ijms-24-13534), [40](#B40-ijms-24-13534), [41](#B41-ijms-24-13534)]. The unmet need for safe suppressor preparations led several researchers to develop down-regulating medications that suppressed the immune- and hemopoietic cell cycle processes. The combined hemo- and immunoregulating data on novel Thymogen-Thymodepressin analogs have created the background for extending our platform technology of exploring DKP peptidomimetics in broad areas of unmet medical needs [ [41](#B41-ijms-24-13534)]. 4. Development of the Peptidomimetic [AlaGlu(Trp)] [39](#B39-ijms-24-13534)], [41](#B41-ijms-24-13534)]. Studies of cyclic peptidomimetics and their linear precursors in various in vitro and in vivo models have identified the potential drug candidate cyclopeptide [AlaGlu(Trp)] (code AWE18) for further experimental studies. This peptidomimetic showed activity parenterally and orally in several experimental models [ [41](#B41-ijms-24-13534)]. A comparison of the actions of pharmaceutical preparations of Stemokin and Thymogen with AWE18 showed the advantage of this peptidomimetic, considering that Stemokin and Thymogen are active only in systemic and intranasal applications, representing the first generations of peptide stem cell stimulants. [40](#B40-ijms-24-13534), [41](#B41-ijms-24-13534)]. also shown that Thymogen stimulates the proliferation of damaged bone marrow cells [ [17](#B17-ijms-24-13534)]. Stemokin exhibits an increased affinity to bone marrow cells and is proven to be a hemostimulating immune and adjuvant peptides have a low cell membrane permeability, limited stability in vivo, and low oral bioavailability, so their preferred administration route into the body is via subcutaneous, intramuscular, stabilizing the hydrolytic lability of natural peptides is incorporating modified analogs of natural peptides, which were previously registered as parenteral drugs [ [53](#B53-ijms-24-13534), [54](#B54-ijms-24-13534), [55](#B55-ijms-24-13534)]. Analog modifications are based on substitutions in various parts of the original molecule to stabilize and sometimes change its structure, spectrum, and even direction of action [ [44](#B44-ijms-24-13534)]. An essential requirement for improving peptide structures is minimizing the possible toxicity of stabilizing the hydrolytic lability of drugs containing natural peptides is incorporating modified analogs of natural peptides that were previously registered as parenteral drugs. Analog modifications are based on substitutions in various parts of the original molecule to stabilize and sometimes change its structure, spectrum, and even direction of action [ [62](#B62-ijms-24-13534)], [ [63](#B63-ijms-24-13534)]. [60](#B60-ijms-24-13534), [61](#B61-ijms-24-13534)] are developing peptide modification strategies Glu-Trp showed that the enantiomeric peptides LL-Glu-Trp and DD-Glu-Trp exhibit a reciprocal effect on immuno- and hemoregulation at the cellular level; LL-Glu-Trp peptides have a stimulating effect, and DD-Glu-Trp peptides short peptide analogs and in the form of \"insertions\" into different positions of the chain became widespread, with a variation in the location of 2,5-DKP at the N- and C-terminus of the molecule or inside the peptide chain to increase the hydrolytic stability and the possibility of oral administration. Examples of such modification of a diketopiperazine ring by attaching peptide fragments are described in [ [57](#B57-ijms-24-13534), [63](#B63-ijms-24-13534), was approved to treat multiple myeloma [ [67](#B67-ijms-24-13534)], and another it application was submitted to clinical trials as a promising antiviral agent against COVID-19 [ [68](#B68-ijms-24-13534)]. Another cyclopeptide. Plecanatide (Trulance) was approved for the treatment of Chronic Idiopathic Constipation and Irritable Bowel derivatives was screened in neuroprotective and adjuvanticity experimental models. Thus, cyclic analogs, including AEW18, protected neuroblastoma cells from the damage of beta-amyloid (A peptides) [ [41](#B41-ijms-24-13534)]. [73](#B73-ijms-24-13534)]. Hydrogen bonds, lipophilicity, size, flexibility, and structure are the key factors affecting peptides' passive permeability. Lipophilicity cyclic peptides require a degree of lipophilicity to cross peptides and the membrane\u2014they can neither be too lipophobic nor too lipophilic. The backbone cyclic absence of free N- and C-termini reduces potential interactions between the peptide and solvent, which is desirable for permeability. A cyclic structure can also be more compact than a linear one, reducing its collision profile in the solution and allowing for it to diffuse faster through the membrane. Finally, cyclic peptides are typically more stable against chemical or enzymatic degradation than linear peptides. Therefore, more peptides are available at each step of the transport process, resulting in a more significant overall amount that is transported [ [74](#B74-ijms-24-13534)].
