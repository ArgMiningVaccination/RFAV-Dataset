Monkeypox can spread to anyone through close, personal, often skin -to-skin, contact. Direct contact with rash, scab, or body fluids from a person with MPX ( most common ) oSexual Transmission: Not traditional STI but sex involves close/intimate contact oOverall, not easily transmitted . Generally, close physical contact exposure is described Indirect contact. i.e., touching objects such as clothing, bedding, or towels used by a person with MPX oLess common, sensitive to UV light and disinfectants Contact with respiratory secretions oProlonged, face -to-face contact (less common) 16Signs and Symptoms: Classic Symptoms Incubation period : Average 7 -14 days (can range from 5 -21 days) Prodromal symptoms (flu -like symptoms) followed 1 -3 days later by characteristic rash Rash progression, shortly after prodrome: Macules Credits: CDC Clinical Recognition Slide Credit: California Prevention Training Center Signs and Symptoms: Classic Symptoms 18Prodrome: Mild or not occurring.

The FDA is not aware of clinical data supporting the use of other sample types, such as blood or saliva, for monkeypox virus testing. Testing samples not taken from a lesion may lead to false test results. 32 FDA Press Release: For Monkeypox Testing, Use Lesion Swab Samples to Avoid False ResultsNon-Lesion Testing...For the Future May be helpful , especially early in course of illness But NOT validated yet Literature suggests non - lesion material could be helpful (serum, throat, peri - anal) Studies underway Pediatric monkeypox patient with unknown source of infection, the Netherlands, June 2022Case report child in Netherlands 33MPX Treatment Akanksha Vaidya, M.D., MPX oNot FDA -approved for MPX; available from CDC through an expanded access protocol Consider TPOXX for: oPeople with severe disease or at risk of severe disease (e.g., weakened immune systems, children < 8 years, pregnant or breastfeeding women, certain skin conditions) oPeople with complications from disease (e.g., pain, proctitis, oropharyngitis ), locations of concern (e.g., eye, genitals) Supportive care of symptoms should be offered to all MPX patientsSupportive Care 36Skin lesions, (TPOXX) Oral (preferred) and IV formulations, weight -based dosing with no age restriction Treatment course: 14-day course Treatment considerations: oOral formulations must be taken with a high fat diet Few side effects: most common headache and nausea 37Tecovirimat (TPOXX): Adverse Effects and DDIs Drug increases during TPOXX and 2 weeks afterward Liverpool website for details Adverse Effects/Contraindications: oOral: Headache, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting.

Post -Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)++ for individuals with certain risk factors who are more likely to have been recently exposed to monkeypox even if they have not had documented exposure to someone with confirmed monkeypox. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis ( PrEP ) for individuals at occupational risk of monkeypox according to Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidance , including laboratory workers who perform monkeypox testing. At this time, most clinicians in the United States and laboratorians not performing monkeypox testing, are not advised to receive monkeypox PrEP. 48Healthcare Worker (HCW) Vaccination Evidence so far is that the risk for transmission to HCWs is low. Supplies of vaccine are extremely limited and priority for vaccination is given to persons at risk due to community (non-healthcare) exposures. Infection control recommendations (including PPE* recommendations) are available and should be followed. CDPH recommends following ACIP guidance related to PrEP for HCWs. Specifically oResearch laboratory personnel working with orthopoxviruses ; oClinical laboratory personnel performing diagnostic testing for orthopoxviruses ; and oOrthopoxvirus and health care worker response teams designated by appropriate public health and anti -terror authorities. In general, it is not recommended to immunize HCWs. oLHJs can work with their local medical providers to offer PrEP to specific \"response teams\" that frequently care for persons who are at high -risk for monkeypox infection. (For example, clinicians in a sexual health or STI clinic who are responsible for swabbing lesions when suspected cases present for care.) Infection control recommendations should be reviewed and reinforced in this context. See CDPH MPX Vaccine FAQs >18 8/9/22, FDA emergency (EUA) allowing o0.1mL given intradermally (one-fifth of subcutaneous 0.5mL dose) four weeks, 28 days, apart. oFor individuals >18 years old at high risk of MPX infection. oData reviewed included clinical study comparing subcutaneous and intradermal (one -fifth dose) administration Similar immune response in both groups. Intradermal administration resulted in nearly all of recipients with redness, firmness, itchiness or swelling at the injection site, but these side effects were manageable. FDA announcement 8/9/2022 CDPH JYNNEOS vaccine old 8/9/22, FDA EUA also allows for use of the vaccine in individuals younger than 18 years of age determined to be at high risk of MPX infection oFor <18 years old, JYNNEOS is administered by subcutaneous injection. If a pediatric high -risk contact case is identified for whom PEP JYNNEOS is being considered , please contact local health department.

Do not administer JYNNEOS vaccine to individuals with a known history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of JYNNEOS. People with a history of anaphylaxis to vaccine component (gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, egg protein) are considered to have a precaution to vaccination. oProviders should discuss risks and benefits with potential recipients. oThey may be vaccinated with a 30 -minute observation period. Interim Clinical Considerations for use of JYNNEOS and ACAM2000 VaccinesCoadministration with Other Vaccines 57Currently, there are no data on administering JYNNEOS vaccine at the same time as other vaccines. Because JYNNEOS is based on a live, attenuated non -replicating orthopoxvirus , JYNNEOS typically may be administered without regard to timing of other vaccines. This includes simultaneous administration of JYNNEOS and other vaccines on the same day, but at different anatomic sites if possible. People, particularly adolescent or young adult males, might consider waiting 4 weeks after orthopoxvirus vaccination (either JYNNEOS or ACAM2000) before receiving a Moderna, Novavax, or Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine, because of the observed risk for myocarditis and/or pericarditis after receipt of ACAM2000 orthopoxvirus vaccine. Interim Clinical Considerations for use of JYNNEOS and ACAM2000 Vaccines2ndVaccine Doses At this time, given the scarce supply of JYNNEOS vaccine, LHJs and providers should prioritize first doses of vaccine for persons at risk. This strategy should be followed even if second doses are consequently administered at an interval greater than 28 days. There is no maximum time window for a valid second dose. As more vaccine doses are available in the coming weeks, LHJs and providers can expand offering second doses to those requesting them. In the meantime, if/when second doses are provided, when possible, prioritize persons who are immunocompromised or at high risk for complications of monkeypox. Individuals who are living with HIV (particularly those with CD4 count < 200/mm3or an opportunistic infection) or other conditions that cause immunocompromise should be prioritized for vaccination, including second doses. 58MPX Vaccine Equity Considerations There is a need to balance equity considerations with volume of vaccinations administered Event -based and mass vaccination activities may be less equitable, but also may reach those at immediate risk of exposure Primary care providers are well -placed to offer other recommended vaccinations to this population such as meningococcal, COVID -19 Vaccines, and influenza vaccines. Strategies that may support vaccine equity oAppointment -based vaccination activities; reserved appointments for priority groups oProactive offer of vaccine to persons at high risk of exposure (e.g., sex workers) oPartnerships as described on previous slide 5960ResourcesMPX Documentation and Billing Providers may bill for MPX vaccine administration MPX -specific CPT codes are posted by the AMA: Orthopoxvirus and monkeypox coding & Guidance Providers may notcharge for the MPX vaccine, as it is provided free of charge by the federal governmentVaccine doses administered MUST be reported to the immunization registry as soon as possible, ideally on the day of administration. Please work with your vaccination partners to ensure they are documenting in a timely fashion! We are using the registry to track administration progress by county.
