I have previously written about [how to menstruate the Ayurvedic way](https://www.jasminehemsley.com/la-vida-veda/2020/2/4/menstruating-the-ayurvedic-way), that is how to find mind-body balance during your period, using the [Doshas](https://www.jasminehemsley.com/dosha) for a guide. Here I'd like to talk a bit about period products, and how Ayurveda recommends you manage period care, as well as some organisations you can help support to help those experiencing period poverty. In Ayurveda, free flow (or letting the blood flow out of your body, but still using period care products to absorb it) is encouraged to let the body naturally purge itself of tissues it no longer needs. That means tampons are not generally recommended, but if that is your preference go for organic/natural materials for health and eco reasons (do check the box/do your own research as it's not always obvious). Privilege non-applicator tampons too for eco reasons, though reusable applicators are available from some brands if you need one. Instead, Ayurvedic practitioners suggest you opt for natural options that let you bleed freely. In the past this has meant sanitary towels \u2014 huge wads of plastic-lined, chemically treated pads whose natural materials might not be sustainably sourced and, when used over a lifetime, add up to astronomical amounts of waste: [ the average menstruator has 450 menstrual cycles in their life, that amounts to 12,000 single-use products, which take 500 years to decompose.](https://pantys.com/pages/how-menstrual-underwear-works) In the West, we're lucky to be inundated with choice when it comes to period products, and recently we can add to that more environmentally friendly innovations. Likewise some products have had a modern makeover, like the menstrual cup [which was first patented in 193](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cup)2, the best known perhaps being the [Mooncup](https://amzn.to/3oSXqwT), a small, foldable, reusable device made from silicone, rubber or plastic which collects, rather than absorbs, the menstrual blood when inserted into the vagina. This is perhaps the most eco-friendly in terms of zero waste for as long as the Mooncup keeps working and is properly cared for, with maybe a pad or period pants as a backup on heavier days if needed. These have become all the rage in the eco world but it's not one I've embraced (though I've spoken to many women who swear by it). I feel more comfortable feeling my flow leave my body \u2014 I feel more in tune with it. In Ayurveda our bodily waste provides information about the health of our body \u2014 signposts that help us to spot when we are going off track so that we can make choices in our everyday to bring it back into balance. Vaidya [Seema Datta](https://keyajee.com/) explains that by bleeding onto a pad/pair of period pants you can see and note the quality or purity of your blood more easily. In the Charaka Samhita (one of the foundational Sanskrit texts on Ayurveda) it is explained that balanced blood does not stain cloth, it is washed off easily. In her Ayurveda practice, Keyajee, which focuses on women's health, this is one of the things that she asks of her clients in order to understand their Dosha and plan their treatments accordingly. When it comes to period products, take note of the materials. The absorbent top layer should be made from all natural materials which ideally haven't been treated with any harmful chemicals in order to reduce skin contact with chlorine bleaches, synthetics, plastics, dioxins, pesticide residues, artificial dyes or fragrances and superabsorbents made from petrochemicals (note that the bottom layer will usually contain some form of polyester in order to make it waterproof). An easy way to look out for this is to look for products that have [STANDARD 100 by OEKO-TEX\u00ae certification](https://www.oeko-tex.com/en/our-standards/standard-100-by-oeko-tex) \u2014 this is one the world's best-known labels for textiles tested for harmful substances. This is especially important for bamboo: whilst bamboo is easy to farm and helps to balance the oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, not all bamboo fabrics are created equal. Given its brittle/hard texture, the easiest way to generate a soft bamboo fabric is through the use of harmful chemicals \u2014 these can be toxic to the environment, workers and yourself. Look out for proper certification or transparency around how a brand produces their product. Read on for some of my sustainable period go-tos: PERIOD PANTS Period pants have grown in popularity \u2014 good branding and flattering designs have made this genius innovation cool. In the last few months they've become even more available: [Bodyform](https://fave.co/2RxBICn)'s are available at Tesco, Wuka at Sainsbury's and [ Primark](https://www.primark.com/en/periodunderwear) recently launched their own pair (I haven't been able to source much information on their composition or the ethics of their making, however I wanted to mention it as it feels like a big step to make ethical femine-care products available at a price point which is affordable for many, as at the moment when sourced from the brands I've found they do come at a larger one-off cost). Period pants sometimes aren't made from 100% natural materials (e.g. nylon, polyester, elastane), I imagine in order to reinforce their shape, keep everything in place and waterproof, but one pair will last you a long time and can save a huge amount of disposable waste. For example, a pair of Thinx pants will last you [up to 2 years](https://fave.co/2RKMW6q). The important thing is to look after them properly, rinse them through after use and then put them in the washing machine with the rest of your laundry and skip the fabric softener. Since the padded part is thicker than most clothing, note that they will take longer to dry than your regular clothes (and should be thoroughly dried before you can wear them again). Check the brand's website for recommendations on how to prolong their lifespan. WUKA use sustainable fabrics and is carbon neutral. The brand's period pants are certified STANDARD 100 by OEKO-TEX\u00ae, contain no added chemicals and use GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) organic cotton, TENCEL and ECONYL. Thinx was the first period pant brand I discovered. The brand's underwear has been successfully tested for harmful substances and certified according to STANDARD 100 by OEKO-TEX\u00ae. These high-waisted period pants are made responsibly from soft and breathable organic cotton. Each pack comes with two pairs of this sustainable underwear, one in coral and the other in black. You can shop by flow on Pantys. This sustainable brand uses biodegradable fibres. There's also a collection for girls who have just started their period. REUSABLE PADS A modern take on a time-honoured way that women have dealt with periods \u2014 using an absorbent, natural material that can be washed and reused again and again. Modern reusable pads [(btw you can make your own](https://www.actionaid.org.uk/blog/2019/05/24/how-to-make-your-own-reusable-sanitary-pads)!!) are comparably cheaper to their period pants counterparts (some brands offer both products) and unlike disposable pads you don't need to buy them every month to throw away. You do however have to be prepared \u2014 if you are at work or on the move and your pad is maxed out you need to carry a waterproof/washable bag to store it until you can get home to wash and dry it. Much like period pants, wash them after use under cold water and add them into the machine with the rest of your laundry. Don't use fabric softener and air dry them thoroughly as opposed to tumble drying to prolong their life cycle. ApiAfrique's reusable sanitary pads and liners are all made from organic cotton velvet (GOTS certified) and waterproof fabric (STANDARD 100 by OEKO-TEX\u00ae certified). They are long-lasting, highly absorbent, comfortable, breathable, easy to use, easy to wash and made from good quality materials. By buying these reusable pads you are directly supporting the work of [ApiAfrique](https://apiafrique.com/en/) - an innovative social enterprise dedicated to the emancipation of women. DAME's reusable pads use 4D fabric technology that holds 10 times its weight in two seconds. A watertight layer gives you extra security. The materials used in the pads are manufactured with no harmful chemicals or finishes, using as many natural ingredients as possible. The core of Bloom and Nora's pads are made from certified STANDARD 100 by OEKO-TEX\u00ae bamboo fleece, while a soft waterproof exterior is made from recycled plastic bottle waste. Hey Girls was created to offer no-leak, super comfy, chlorine and bleach-free, environmentally friendly products that tackle period poverty in the UK. All profits from the brand's Buy One Give One products go directly to help people in need. The reusable pads feature two layers of micro-fibre bamboo which is certified STANDARD 100 by OEKO-TEX\u00ae. There are many other brands out there but please do your research on the fabrics they are using (see intro) and how they were processed, as well as the eco certifications they have \u2014 this information sometimes isn't readily available or easy to find out via their website so do get in touch with them to check! DISPOSABLE NATURAL PADS Sometimes, disposable might feel like the best option \u2014 if you aren't going to have the convenience of having washing facilities nearby or are going to be out for a very long period of time it ultimately just might be more convenient. Thankfully, there are lots of brilliant brands offering pads made from natural materials like bamboo and cotton. Not only are these better for the environment, but they are better for your personal health as well. Likewise, whilst more commercial period pads contain plastics and therefore have to be disposed of in the rubbish (therefore ending up in our landfills) organic natural pads which have been made from [100% plant-based materials can be composted](https://www.natracare.com/blog/can-you-compost-menstrual-products/)! Flo's pads and liners are made from 100% organic, edge grown, sustainable bamboo and have plant-based and compostable wrappers. 5% of the brand's profits go to girls and women in need, and every month they donate products to help fight period poverty. Grace and Green's pads are 100% organic cotton, making them highly absorbent, lightweight and breathable, as well as offering around-the-clock protection from leaks. They come wrapped in biodegradable purse packs for convenience and are available to order on a subscription basis so you don't have to worry about running out. Yoppie offer personalised period care subscription options based on the length of your cycle, your flow and your product preference (pads/liners/tampons etc.). The brand's pads are made from soft, certified organic cotton grown without harmful pesticides, purified without chlorine bleach and crafted without fragrances or synthetics (hypoallergenic friendly). Natracare's pads are free from chlorine, dioxin bleach, plastics, latex, petroleum derivatives, phthalates, super absorbent gels, GMOs, perfumes and dyes. You also won't find any perfumes or dyes that you'd find in conventional period products. They are made from certified organic cotton, ecologically certified cellulose pulp, plant starch and non-toxic glue. IN SUMMARY All in all my experience is to have a bit of everything above going on. I've been lucky enough to try out period pants from quite a few brands and have been using them for the last couple of years. I I love a high waist which feels supportive and snug and like everything is going to stay in place, and have found that having one pair larger than your usual size is good for tummy tender/bloated days. On heavy, heavy days or when I will be away from the comfort of my own home, I line these pants with a reusable or natural pad. This also works well for me during the night on my heaviest days \u2014 I sleep so much more soundly not worrying if I am about to stain the bed. Otherwise, with moderate flow I'll go for a reusable pad if I know I can bag it and take it home or hand-wash it straight away and hang it up to dry (I work A LOT from home, especially these days). I'll use a disposable natural pad if I'm out of the house for lengths of time and then when it comes to light flow it just has to be the reusable pads or period pants. Throwing a lightly soiled sanitary towel into the bin just doesn't feel right.
