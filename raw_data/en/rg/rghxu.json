And that's not all that surprising, considering the numerous factors at play with mens multivitamins. First, there's [a generational factor](https://www.menshealth.com/health/a18925935/father-son-health-face-off/). You might recall your [father](https://www.menshealth.com/technology-gear/g39574801/best-father-in-law-gifts/) (or grandfather) incorporating a daily multivitamin for men. He might have even suggested that you try out some of the best multivitamins for men to help you \"grow up [big](https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/g38883476/best-supplements-for-muscle-growth/) and [strong](https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a44357550/strength-vs-muscle-workouts/).\" Second, there's the general 'that-makes-sense' factor. If you're opting for the best multivitamins for men, wouldn't you want one that includes [all the essential vitamins?](https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/a34669166/personalized-vitamins-supplements/) And, finally, there's the cover-your-bases factor. Even if you're confident in your [healthy diet](https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/a42297584/lazy-diet/), you might consider that there could be [nutrients](https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/a44649208/what-is-eating-globally/) you're missing, and a mens multivitamin could help address those gaps. Read more: [How Men's Health Thoroughly Tests and Reviews Nutrition Products](https://www.menshealth.com/technology-gear/a43807148/our-expertise-mens-health-product-reviews/) But, as it turns out, certain multivitamins for men are easily absorbed, while others present challenges in absorption. Indeed, vitamins and minerals obtained from [food](https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/g44692972/best-foods-for-men-2023/) are typically more [bioavailable](https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/are_you_absorbing_the_nutrients_you_eat) compared to supplements. This is due to the intricate combination of nutrients present in [whole foods](https://www.menshealth.com/weight-loss/a19542022/whole-30-diet-for-weight-loss/), which synergistically improve the absorption and utilization of vitamins. Food contains other compounds such as enzymes and phytochemicals that can also enhance the absorption and utilization of vitamins, too. That's why opting for a mens multivitamin sourced from food is particularly beneficial. These formulations include enzymes to enhance both synthetic and natural vitamins with [vegetable proteins](https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/a19541471/best-vegan-protein-powders/). So, here's the thing: Despite the fact that doctors have long recommended multivitamins and people have long taken them, most people probably don't need to take a multivitamin. \"It's true that most of us can get all of our vitamins and minerals from food, with the exception of vegans and B12, and multivitamins typically contain a lot of things we don't need, and not enough of the things we might need,\" says [Abby Langer, RD](https://www.menshealth.com/author/224259/abby-langer/), the owner of [Abby Langer Nutrition](https://abbylangernutrition.com/), a Toronto-based nutrition consulting and communications company. Even the best multivitamins for men can't replace a healthy diet. Prioritizing a well-balanced diet abundant in whole foods is absolutely essential to giving your body the nutrients it needs to thrive. With that said, the current market has a few excellently formulated multivitamins for men that effectively complement nutritional requirements, bridging gaps in an already sound diet. If you're looking for a helping hand in finding one of the best mens multivitamin options to complement your diet, you're in the right place. Read on for our top 11 picks. [Best Superfoods Powders](https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/g36186816/best-superfood-powders/) | [Best Mushroom Supplements](https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/g37358185/best-mushroom-supplements/) | [Sex Supplements That Work](https://www.menshealth.com/health/a19546875/supplements-for-better-sex/) | [Best Iron Supplements to Help with a Deficiency](https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/a35351362/best-iron-supplements/) | [Muscle-Building That [Best Whey Protein Powders](https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/g19547347/best-whey-powder-review/) Ritual is one of the few supplement brands being repped by wellness influencers these days that actually deserves the hype. It contains 10 essential nutrients that are often lacking in men's diets, including vitamins D3, K2, B12, boron, zinc, and magnesium. We took this multivitamin daily for 4 months and loved how small and easy-to-swallow each capsule is. Taken in the morning with or without breakfast, we found this multi to be gentle on the stomach in comparison to some competitors we tested. We also felt that the minty-fresh aftertaste is also a massive step up from the chalky, off-putting aftertaste many traditional multis leave you with. The subscription option made it possible for a fresh bottle to show up on our doorstep before we ran out, which is a no-brainer for busy individuals like us. For those such as ourselves who are skeptical about the purity and reliability of supplement, the transparency Ritual offers on its site regarding the source, form, and quality of every ingredient is a breath of fresh air, too. Another one of Ritual's main selling points is its gender-specific formulations, which essentially boils down to a little more and a little less of certain nutrients compared to a women's multi. \"Gender-specific supplements often have more calcium and iron for women, and more zinc for men. Otherwise, they're often very similar,\" says Langer. While a zinc boost is great for men, Langer reminds to beware of marketing, \"If you think taking a multivitamin is warranted, the most important thing to check is not the gender on the bottle, but rather if it contains enough of what you believe you're missing in your diet.\" Read more: [Best Fiber Supplements](https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/a38379342/best-fiber-supplement/) This blend from Ritual features all the perks that the Essential for Men Multivitamin 18+ does, except, plot twist: it's optimized for older men. The Essential for Men Multivitamin 50+ is uniquely crafted to enhance bone health, brain function, and immune support. With aging, men experience shifts in nutrient absorption, utilization, and heightened vulnerability to specific health concerns, leading to an increased requirement for vitamins E, B12, K2, and magnesium. This version incorporates slightly higher amounts of these nutrients in comparison to the 18+ formula to ensure more comprehensive nutritional support tailored to older men. Like the other supplement offerings from the brand, this multivitamin also packs a peppermint punch that we really enjoyed. You can trust this formula is also free from fillers, synthetic additives, and common allergens like gluten and soy. Read more: [2022 CBD Awards](https://www.menshealth.com/health/a39048974/cbd-awards-2022/) This multi designed to provide comprehensive nutritional support for athletes and active individuals. The formula provides a broad range of essential vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, calcium, magnesium, zinc, and selenium, to help support overall health and wellness. A blend of amino acids, too, which can help support muscle recovery and repair after exercise. It also contains methylfolate, not folic acid, which aids in nutrient absorption. Plus, it's certified by the National Sanitation Foundation International. That NSF seal ensures product quality. Read more: [Best Creatine Supplements](https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/g40182295/best-creatine-supplements/) Say hello to Thorne Research Basic Nutrients 2/Day, a comprehensive formula designed to be taken twice a day to support those with more significant clinical vitamin and mineral needs.

And with no added artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives, you can feel confident that you're getting only the highest-quality, purest ingredients. The brand's products are almost all NSF Certified for Sport to ensure that they're free from banned substances and contaminants, including this multi. Read more: [Best Supplements for Men](https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/a19539297/the-top-10-supplements-for-men/) Men's Nutrients from Pure Encapsulations is a comprehensive supplement designed for men over 40 looking to support their overall health and wellness. The formula contains a broad range of essential vitamins and minerals, as well as antioxidants, amino acids, and other nutrients to help support overall health. This multi also features saw palmetto extract, pygeum extract, and lycopene, which can help support prostate health and reduce the risk of prostate-related health issues. With men over 40 in mind, the formula also incorporates antioxidants to help support energy production and reduce fatigue. Green tea is included, which does contain caffeine and can act as a stimulant, so it can be great to take before a gym sesh. Just be sure not to pop these before bed. It's designed to be easy to digest and absorb, and it is free from common allergens like gluten, dairy, and soy, too. And the brand is NSF GMP certified. Read more: [Best Muscle-Building Supplements](https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/g38883476/best-supplements-for-muscle-growth/) Clinical Nutrients HP provides high-potency nutrient support through essential vitamins and minerals. The formula contains a range of antioxidants to help protect against free radical damage and support healthy aging.

Read more: [Best Whey Protein Powders](https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/g19547347/best-whey-powder-review/) This multivitamin is specifically designed for men to support immune health, bone health, healthy cognitive function and overall vitality for healthy, active individuals. The formula is one of the more comprehensive on this list, including at least 100% of the daily recommended value for more than 20 vitamins and minerals such as 50 mcg (2,000 IU) of vitamin D3, zinc, B vitamins and potent antioxidants like beta-carotene. Note that this is a multivitamin without iron (iron free), as men typically have sufficient iron levels and that too-high levels of iron can result in dangerous toxicity. A daily dose is just one pill once daily, so it's a good choice for those looking to scale down from other multis that require 2+ pills to be taken daily. This formula is also free from dyes, gluten, and animal products. And it's been independently verified for content accuracy, purity, and freedom of contaminants with the gold-standard NSF seal of approval. So you can know that what's advertised on the Nutrition Facts Panel is what's actually inside the pill itself. Read more: [Best Vitamins for Your Immune System](https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/a42572527/vitamins-for-immune-system/) If a whole food-derived, organic multivitamin is at the top of your list, this pick from Garden of Life is a good place to start. Men's Once Daily is made from a blend of organic fruits and vegetables, which provides a wide range of natural vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants and ensures you aren't taken a pesticide-laden pill each day. Containing 15 essential vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, D, E, K, and a range of B, it's a broad spectrum choice that can supplement a healthy diet effectively. The formula is designed specifically for older men to support prostate and heart health. It's free from synthetic additives, fillers, and binders, which are commonly found in many other supplements.

One of our favorites is the Foundation for Daily Essentials supplement, a plant-based formula designed to offer a balanced range of nutrients. It contains a blend of 22 essential vitamins and minerals, including mineral chelates such as calcium, magnesium, zinc, copper, manganese, molybdenum, chromium, and boron (which are more easily absorbed by the body). This supplement also provides vitamin K in both the K1 and K2 forms, tocotrienols from annatto extract for higher activity, and concentrated phytonutrients like lutein, lycopene, wild blueberry complex, and citrus bioflavonoids for optimal health support. One downside: a single daily dose consists of 4 pills in total. The brand recommends dividing dosing, though doesn't specify how. Read more: [Best Vegan Protein Powder](https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/a19541471/best-vegan-protein-powders/) You get at least 100 percent of the USDA recommended daily allowance of vitamins C, D, and E in a capsule that's much smaller than some of the horse pills you'll find in the supplement aisle. Plus, a blend of other essential vitamins and minerals that men need, including thiamin, pantothenic acid, and iodine. This formula also has a mix of additional antioxidants such as selenium and beta-carotene, which can help protect cells from oxidative damage caused by free radicals. It contains folic acid (which is a plus), but unfortunately, not in the form of methylfolate. The supplement is designed to be taken once daily with a meal to help ensure optimal absorption of the nutrients. At just 10 cents per dose, it's one of the cheapest multis on this list. And it's USP certified for quality Read more: [Best Men's Advanced Multivitamin is another great multivitamin made with real food and natural ingredients, which means it's free from synthetic additives and artificial preservatives. It is also Non-GMO Project Verified and tested for purity and potency and NSF Certified. The supplement includes vitamins A-E, K, calcium, potassium and more.

That lack of oversight is one of the many reasons that, as a consumer, choosing a high-quality multivitamin can feel like the wild west of the wellness world. Here are a few key factors to consider: Certification: Look for a multivitamin with third-party certification from a trusted entity (USP, NSF, Informed Choice). This certification verifies that what's on the label of the multivitamin is what's actually in the multivitamin itself to ensure quality and safety. Check the label: You want a formula that contains 100% of the Daily Value (DV) for most vitamins and minerals. And then, specifically, choose a multivitamin that contains the active (and more beneficial) form of folate called methylfolate, not folic acid. Avoid mega-dose multivitamins, which can contain far more than the recommended daily intake and may be harmful. Consider your needs: Think about your age, gender, and any specific health concerns you may have. For example, men who are vegetarian or vegan may have higher vitamin B requirements than men who eat animal products, while older men may benefit from a multivitamin with extra vitamin D. Talk to your healthcare provider: If you have any concerns, questions or health conditions, talk to your healthcare provider. They can help you choose a multivitamin that is right for you based on your individual needs and health status. What Are the Benefits of Taking a Multivitamin? A 2019 Tufts and Harvard [study](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M18-2478) found that despite the $43-billion [supplement industry](https://www.menshealth.com/health/a36945827/toxic-supplement-hunter-pieter-cohen-md/) marketing that states otherwise, people who took a multivitamin lived no longer than those that didn't. And, in fact, popping a multivitamin may backfire when it comes to your daily diet. \"Some people who take a multivitamin use them to justify less healthy eating habits,\" says [JoAnn Manson, M.D.](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/joann-manson/), professor at Harvard Medical School. Vitamin-takers may become complacent about diet, thinking they're covered by nutrients in the vitamin. The above information considered, science does show a benefit for reducing cancer risk, says [Michael Roizen, M.D.](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/6161-michael-roizen), Chief Wellness Officer Emeritus at Cleveland Clinic. A randomized clinical [trial](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1380451) (the gold standard in research) found an 18 percent reduction in cancer risk among initially healthy older men who took a daily multi for more than a decade. It may seem like 18 percent isn't significant, but still: cancer. \"The data on multivitamins in the short-term isn't beneficial for otherwise healthy men,\" says Dr. Roizen. So if you take a supplement for a few months, and then stop for a few years, and then repeat, you're simply forking over your cash to supplement companies. (The top four companies spent a collective $155 million on advertising in 2014 alone.) So if you're healthy and have no major dietary restrictions\u2014diagnosed or self-imposed ( [vegan](https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/a27029368/vegan-diet-healthy-live-longer-study/), gluten-free, [Keto](https://www.menshealth.com/keto-diet-guide/), etc.)\u2014you don't need a multivitamin. If you do have a highly restricted or poor diet, suffer from a gastrointestinal problem that impairs nutrient absorption such as celiac disease, or take certain medications including proton pump inhibitors for heartburn, then you may need a multivitamin and/or a specific nutrient supplement. This is the kind of situation where if you haven't already talked to your doctor about a multivitamin, it's time. Which Vitamins and Minerals Do Men Need? According to the [Dietary Guidelines for Americans](https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf), adult men should consume the following vitamins and minerals daily: Vitamin A: Men need 900 micrograms of vitamin A per day to support vision, immune function, and skin health. Good sources of vitamin A include liver, sweet potatoes, carrots, and spinach. Vitamin C: 90 milligrams of vitamin C per day to support immune function, wound healing, and antioxidant protection. Good sources of vitamin C include citrus fruits, strawberries, broccoli, and bell peppers. Vitamin D: 15 micrograms of vitamin D per day to support bone health, immune function, and overall health. Good sources of vitamin D include fortified dairy products, fatty fish, and exposure to sunlight. Vitamin E: 15 milligrams of vitamin E per day to support antioxidant protection and skin health. Good sources of vitamin E include nuts, seeds, vegetable oils, and leafy greens. Vitamin K: 120 micrograms of vitamin K per day to support blood clotting and bone health. Good sources of vitamin K include leafy greens, liver, and fermented foods. Calcium: 1,000 milligrams of calcium per day to support bone health and muscle function. Good sources of calcium include dairy products, leafy greens, and fortified foods. Magnesium: 400-420 milligrams of magnesium per day to support muscle and nerve function, heart health, and bone health. Good sources of magnesium include nuts, seeds, whole grains, and leafy greens. Zinc: 11 milligrams of zinc per day to support immune function, wound healing, and reproductive health. Good sources of zinc include oysters, beef, beans, and nuts. Iron: 8 milligrams of iron per day to support oxygen transport in the blood and energy production. Good sources of iron include red meat, poultry, beans, and fortified grains. How Often Should a Multivitamin Be Taken (and When)? Most multivitamins are designed to be taken once or twice a day, every day, to help fill any nutrient gaps in your diet and provide ongoing support for overall health. It's important to follow the instructions on the label of your specific multivitamin, though, as some may be designed to be taken more or less frequently. Timing matters, too. Taking a multivitamin with food can help your body better absorb and utilize the nutrients it contains, since food can help stimulate the release of digestive enzymes that break down the vitamins and minerals. Which is why many instructions on the bottle indicate to take the vitamin with food. Consider taking half of your multivitamin in the morning and half in the evening to keep vitamins and mineral levels steadier, Dr. Roizen says. Some formulas may even contain added ingredients such as caffeine or anti-inflammatory compounds, so be diligent by reading ingredient labels to ensure you aren't taking caffeine at night, for example.
