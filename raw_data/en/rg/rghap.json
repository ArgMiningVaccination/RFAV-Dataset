These views have been present for a long time and have been carried onto by a wide range of people; for example, the indigenous people of ancient times saw natural disasters such as floods and drought as retribution from divine forces for their wrongdoings. The spiritual powers have gained popularity in the past especially in the middle ages; this is because they have created a criminal justice system owing to the fact that the middle ages are bonded with the feudal powers. Spiritualistic criminal and justice system regarded crime as a private affair and was administered between the offender and the family of the victim. On the other hand, Naturalistic view explains that humans are entitled to rights and people fear to commit a crime in fear of sanctions that might befall them, they are derived from the natural rights found in the European political and legal ideas in the classical times. All people have human rights at all times and places; this is just simply by their humanity. Because it applies to logic, it would be important to note than naturalistic explanations to crime allows different interpretations (Nivette, A. 2014). However, the interpretations have at least two different things in common; the rights that are either recognized by the society or by the virtue that people are humans, they are entitled to human rights by their humanity. Spiritualistic explanation of crime is often applied by the different people and is widely shared among the Catholics and Protestants; it postulates that human beings have body, mind, and soul making them contain physical, non-physical that are not separable from each other. This theory postulates that humans have the ability of discerning difference between good and bad because they have a conscience (Dewey, J. 2016). There is a myriad of god things that humans can do according to this explanations, procreation is one of them but is common to all the other animals while some like the pursuit of truth are peculiar to the humans. Naturalistic on the other hand is one of the philosophies that postulates that certain rights exist by being human; these types of rights can be understood through reason. Because this rule is known as natural law, it came about by careful annals of the human nature to include the moral behavior making it universal. Spiritual Explanations for Crime Spiritual explanations of crime have the general view that many events are influenced by higher powers. In the middle ages, the European lords came up with methods by which they thought that God indicated the individual that was innocent and the one that was guilty. Some of the methods included battle where God gave victory to the innocent party (DeLisi, M., & Vaughn, M. G. 2014). Later in history, the accused was subjected to a painful test and would often test whether they were innocent. The innocent individual was believed to be protected by God, and on the other hand, the guilty one would die painfully. The trial was ordeal later replaced by the method by which a group of people gathered, and all would swear that the accused was innocent and lying under oath would bring about punishment by God. The current time's prison was an idea that came about in association with a spiritual explanation of crime where a group of Quakers came about with the idea of isolating criminals in private cells then giving them a Bible to study. Natural Explanations for Crime Unlike spiritual explanation of crime, natural explanations harness objects and event to explain what happens (Christie, N. 2016). Among some of the pioneers of natural explanations is the Hippocrates that provided an explanation of thinking that the brain is an organ of the mind. Some like Plato and Aristotle through their ideas came up with the virtue of unity. However, all their explanations remained both physical and material. The Roman law and Hebrew doctrine of divine punishment of law and order agreed with naturalism postulated by the Greek and provided explanations basin on the natural things. Afterward, the rule of kings by right came to be a natural law that examined the nature of things for justifications. Useful info: The best place to hire pro [MBA essay writers]on the Web.
