Recent H3N2 egg-based vaccine antigens have limited effectiveness, partially due to egg-adaptive substitutions that alter the antigenicity of the hemagglutinin nucleoside-modi ed mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNP) vaccine platform is a promising alternative for egg-based in fluenza vaccines because mRNA-LNP-derived antigens are not subject to adaptive pressures that arise during theproduction of antigens in chicken eggs. Here, we compared H3N2-speci ca n t i b o d y responses in mice vaccinated with either 3c.2A H3-encoding mRNA-LNP or a with an anti- with the wild-type 3c2.A H3N2, whereas the egg-based Fluzone vaccine did not. We found that both mRNA-LNP vaccines elicited high levels of group 2 HA stalk-re-active antibodies, which likely contributed to protection in vivo. Our studies indicate that nucleoside-modi ed mRNA-LNP-based vaccines can circumvent problems associ- ated with egg adaptations with recent 3c2.A H3N2 viruses. IMPORTANCE This study shows that the nucleoside-modi ed mRNA-LNP vaccine platform is a promising alternative for egg-based in fluenza vaccines. We show that mRNA-LNP vaccines expressing H3 antigens elicit high levels of antibodies in mice and protect against H3N2 in fluenza virus infection. KEYWORDS antibodies, in fluenza, in fluenza vaccines, mRNA vaccine Influenza vaccine antigens that are prepared in fertilized chicken eggs have limited effectiveness, especially against contemporary H3N2 in fluenza viruses (1, 2). Recent 3c.2A H3N2 viruses cannot be propagated in eggs without rst acquiring adaptive he- magglutinin (HA) substitutions that alter antigenicity. Egg-adapted 3c.2A H3N2 vaccine possess a T160K HA substitution that abrogates an antigenically important N- linked glycosylation site at positions 158 and 160 in site B of HA (3). Antibodies elicited by egg-adapted 3c.2A H3N2 vaccine strains react poorly to contemporary wild-type H3N2 viruses (3, 4).

Unlike egg-based and cell-based in fluenza vaccines, antigens from mRNA-LNP- based in fluenza vaccines are produced in cells of the vaccinee and are not subject to selective pressures from egg or cell viral propagation. Here, we used a murine model to directly compare nucleoside-modi ed mRNA-LNP vaccines expressing wild-type and egg-adapted H3 with conventional inactivated egg-based in mRNA-LNP vaccines expressing wild-type and egg-adapted 3c2.A H3, and we compared these vaccines to a human egg-adaptedFluzone vaccine supplemented with an MF59-like adjuvant. We quanti ed serum anti- body levels after vaccination, and we measured viral lung titers after challenging vacci-nated mice with a 3c2.A H3N2 virus. RESULTS mRNA-LNP expressing wild-type HA elicits neutralizing of different compared to mRNA-LNP expressing egg-adapted HA. 3c.2A H3N2 viruses cannot replicate in fertilized chicken eggs without rst acquiring a T160K HA substi- tution, and this egg adaptation affects antigenicity (3). We created mRNA-LNP vaccines expressing the HA of the A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 3c.2A H3N2 virus, which was the H3N2 component of the 2016 -2017 and 2017 -2018 Northern Hemisphere in fluenza vaccine. Kong/4801/2014 strains possess the T160K HA substitution(3). We created mRNA-LNP expressing the wild-type HA or HA with the egg-adaptiveT160K substitution (referred to as egg-adapted HA), and we evaluated these vaccines,which differed by a single HA amino acid substitution, in BALB/c mice. We immunized BALB/c mice intramuscularly (i.m.) with 1 mgo r1 0 mg of each mRNA-LNP, and we collected serum 1 and 3 months after vaccination. Mice immunizedwith wild-type HA mRNA-LNP produced higher levels of neutralizing antibodies against the wild-type A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 virus, compared to mice immunized with egg- adapted HA mRNA-LNP (Fig. 1A and B). Conversely, mice immunized with egg-adaptedHA mRNA-LNP produced higher levels of neutralizing antibodies against the egg-adapted A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 virus, compared to mice immunized with wild-typeHA mRNA-LNP (Fig. 1A and B). Antibody levels elicited by 1- mg and 10- mg doses were similar for both wild-type HA mRNA-LNP and egg-adapted HA mRNA-LNP. Antibody levels were similar at 1 and 3 months after vaccination with both wild-type HA mRNA-LNP and egg-adapted HA mRNA-LNP. Comparison of mRNA-LNP and a conventional egg-based in fluenza vaccine. We completed additional experiments to directly compare the mRNA-LNP vaccines with the 2017 -2018 version of Fluzone. Relative to wild-type MF59-like adjuvantAddavax to the Fluzone vaccine for our experiments, because conventional inactivatedvaccines can be poorly immunogenic in mice without adjuvant. We vaccinated BALB/c mice i.m. with a total volume of 50 mL of the Fluzone-Addavax mixture, which contains 0.75mg of each of the in fluenza antigens (H1, H3, and 2 in fluenza B virus HAs). In paral- lel, we vaccinated additional groups of BALB/c mice i.m. with 10 mg of mRNA-LNP expressing wild-type or egg-adapted HAs. We obtained serum 28 days after vaccina-tion for serological analyses. Similar to our initial vaccine dose titration experiments, mice immunized with wild- type HA mRNA-LNP produced high levels of neutralizing antibodies against the wild-type A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 virus (Fig. 2A), while mice immunized with egg-adapted HA mRNA-LNP produced high levels of neutralizing antibodies against the egg- adapted A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 virus (Fig. 2B).

Addavax produced antibodies that could weakly neutralize the egg-adapted A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 virus (Fig. 2B), and the Kong/4801/2014 virus (Fig. virus inour study possessed only the T160K HA substitution, whereas the Fluzone egg-adapted3c2.A virus possessed the N96S, L194P, and D225N substitutions in addition to theT160K substitution. For this reason, we repeated neutralization assays using a 3c2.A vi-rus with all four HA substitutions that were in egg-adapted virus (with all egg-adapted substitutions) better (Fig. 2C) than the egg-adapted 3c2.A virus with only the T160K HA substitution (Fig. 2B). Antibodies elicited by wild-type HA mRNA-LNP had similar neutralizing activities against the Fluzone egg- adapted 3c2.A virus (Fig. 2C) and the 3c2.A virus with only the T160K substitution (Fig.2B). Antibodies elicited by egg-adapted HA mRNA-LNP also had similar neutralizingactivities against the Fluzone egg-adapted 3c2.A virus (Fig. 2C) and the 3c2.A viruswith only the T160K substitution (Fig. 2B). HA mRNA-LNP vaccines elicit antibodies that target conserved epitopes in the H3 stalk. We previously vaccines expressing H1 anti- gens elicit neutralizing antibodies, as well as antibodies that bind to conserved epi-topes within H1 (group 1) stalk proteins (6). We completed additional enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assays (ELISAs) with serum collected 28 days after vaccination, todetermine whether the H3 mRNA-LNP vaccines in our study elicit antibodies that bindto conserved epitopes in H3 (group 2) stalk antibodies reactive to a wild-type 3c2.A full-length recombinant HA protein (Fig. and H3recombinant protein (Fig. 3B). The wild-type HA mRNA-LNP vaccine and egg-adaptedHA mRNA-LNP vaccine elicited high levels of antibodies that bound to the 3c2.A full-length recombinant HA protein, whereas the Fluzone month post-vaccination 10204080160320640128025605120)3 month post-vaccination ** FIG 1 Mice vaccinated with wild-type HA and egg-adapted HA mRNA-LNP produce neutralizing antibodies of different speci cities.

The two mRNA-LNP vaccines elicited similar levels of antibodies that bound to the headless H3 stalk, while theFluzone plus Addavax vaccine did detectable levels of H3 stalk-binding anti-bodies (Fig. 3B). Most HA stalk antibodies provide protection through nonneutralizing mechanisms that require Fc receptor engagement (11), such as antibody-dependent cellular cyto-toxicity (ADCC). Therefore, we quanti ed the ADCC activity of serum antibodies using a reporter bioassay. For these experiments, we transfected cells with a plasmid encodingwild-type 3c2.A HA, and added serum antibodies and ADCC effector cellsexpressing FcgRIV cell surface the wild-type HA mRNA-LNP vaccine andegg-adapted HA mRNA-LNP vaccine elicited antibodies that mediated ADCC (Fig. 3C).The Fluzone plus Addavax vaccine did not elicit antibodies that could ef ciently medi- ate ADCC. Antibodies elicited by HA mRNA-LNP prevent replication of wild-type 3c2.A H3N2 viruses in mice. We completed experiments to determine whether antibodies elicited by HA mRNA-LNP and Fluzone plus Addavax vaccines protect mice from infec-tion with a wild-type 3c2.A virus. For this, we passively transferred serum from vacci-nated mice into previously unexposed mice, and then we intranasally infected thesemice with viruses that possessed the wild-type A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 HA. The chal-lenge virus used in these experiments possessed internal genes from the mouse-adapted A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 strain to facilitate viral replication. Since viruses withthe wild-type 3c2.A HA do not cause weight loss and measurable disease in mice, weisolated lung tissue 2 days after infection and quanti ed lung viral titers as a proxy for influenza virus disease. Viral lung titers were the highest in control mice that received sera from unvaccinated mice and in mice that received sera from mice vaccinated withFluzone plus Addavax (Fig. 4). As expected on the basis of our neutralizing antibodydata, viral lung titers were signi cantly lower in mice that received sera from mice vac- cinated with the wild-type HA mRNA-LNP vaccine. Viral lung titers were also low inmice that received sera from mice vaccinated with the egg-adapted HA mRNA-LNPvaccine. This nding was surprising because the egg-adapted HA mRNA-LNP vaccine elicited low levels of neutralizing antibodies against the 3c.2A wild-type virus (Fig. 2A).Since we found that the two mRNA-LNP vaccines elicited similar levels of H3 stalk-WT HA A B C * * ** * * * ** * * * * ** * FIG 2 Mice vaccinated with Fluzone plus Addavax do not mount neutralizing antibodies against wild-type 3c2.A H3N2 viruses.

DISCUSSION Conventional inactivated and subunit in fluenza vaccines dramatically reduce hospi- talizations and deaths caused by in fluenza viruses, but there is certainly room for improvement. In fluenza viruses are constantly changing, and vaccines are less effective when vaccine strains are mismatched to circulating strains (2). Vaccine strains are typi- cally chosen ;9 months prior to an in fluenza season, and it is not always possible to accurately predict which viral strains will dominate. To complicate matters further, influenza virus HA antigens sometimes change during the vaccine-manufacturing pro- cess. Viruses often acquire adaptive HA mutations that facilitate replication in cellsA* 0.00.51.01.52.0 serum Fluzone + * **400 800 1600 mRNA-LNP PBS * * **C FIG 3 mRNA-LNP vaccines, but not Fluzone plus Addavax, elicit H3 stalk-reactive antibodies that can mediate ADCC.

Egg adaptations have been particularly problematic for recent 3c.2A H3N2viruses, since these viruses cannot be propagated in fertilized chicken eggs without rst acquiring a T160K HA substitution that alters antibody binding (3). Nucleoside-modi ed mRNA-LNP vaccines have been a useful tool against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and these vaccines show promise for other infectious diseases, including in fluenza viruses (12). These vaccines can be updated faster than with most conventional in fluenza vaccine approaches, which can potentially limit vaccine strain mismatches. mRNA-LNP vaccine antigens are produced in cells of vaccinees and are thus not subject to selective pressures relatedto vaccine production. In this study, we created a nucleoside-modi ed mRNA-LNP vac- cine expressing a wild-type H3 antigen that is dif cult to produce in fertilized chicken eggs, and we showed that this vaccine was more effective than an adjuvanted conven- tional in fluenza vaccine in a murine model. We also tested an mRNA-LNP vaccine expressing an egg-adapted H3 antigen. While our mRNA-LNP vaccine expressing wild-type H3 antigen elicited higher levels of neu- tralizing antibodies against wild-type H3N2, relative to our mRNA-LNP vaccine express- ing egg-adapted antigen, both vaccines reduced viral titers for wild-type H3N2 in mice. Similar to what we previously found for group 1 H1 viruses (6), we found that H3 mRNA-LNP elicited group 2 HA stalk-reactive antibodies that ef ciently mediated ADCC. mRNA-LNP vaccines elicit sustained germinal center reactions (5), which likely promote antibody responses against epitopes that are usually subdominant, such as antibodies directed against the HA stalk. Our study has some limitations. We did not complete careful dose titrations of Fluzone-Addavax, and it is possible that higher doses of this vaccine would elicit betterantibody responses. Another limitation is that we used lung viral titers as a proxy for influenza virus disease, since we did not possess an 3c.2A H3N2 strain that causes dis- ease in mice. Further studies should evaluate different doses of vaccines and different animal models with additional viral challenge strains. Collectively, our studies show that H3 mRNA-LNP vaccines can overcome problems associated with egg adaptations and are also effective when the HA is antigenicallyWT HA mRNA-LNP egg HA mRNA-LNP Fluzone + AddavaxPBS10100100010000100000 vaccine groupLung viral titer (Relative copy number)* ** * FIG 4 Antibodies elicited by HA mRNA-LNP reduce wild-type 3c2.A H3N2 virus replication in mice.

Further studies should evaluate different H3 mRNA-LNP vaccines in other animal models and in humans. There is an urgent need tospeed up the process of updating speci c mRNA-LNP antigens for human use. There was a major delay in updating SARS-CoV-2 vaccine antigens, and it will be importantto accelerate this process for H3 mRNA-LNP vaccines since H3N2 viruses continuouslyundergo antigenic drift. MATERIALS AND METHODS Vaccines. mRNA-LNP was produced as described previously (13). mRNA-LNP was diluted in 50 mLo f sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and animals were vaccinated i.m. with either 1 mgo r1 0 mgo f an MF59-like adjuvant, at a 1:1 ratio. Animals were injected with a total volume of 50 mL of the Fluzone-Addavax mixture, which contained 0.75 mg of each of the in fluenza antigens (H1, H3, and two in fluenza B virus HAs). Viruses. Viruses expressing the wild-type HA from A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (3c2.A), the egg-adapted HA from substitution), substitutions) were generated through The neuraminidase (NA) from the wild-type A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 strain was included in all three reverse-genetics-derived viruses. Viruses were rescued by transfecting cocultures of pDZ based) encodingall eight in fluenza virus gene segments. Viruses harbored the internal genes from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 in combination with HA and NA genes of interest. Transfection supernatants were harvested 3 days after trans-fection by centrifugation at 1,800 /C2gf o r5m i na n dw e r es t o r e da t 280\u00b0C. Virus RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy minikits (Qiagen), and the HA and NA genes of all viruses were sequenced to con rm that no additional mutations had been introduced. Animals. BALB/c mice (7- to 9-week-old female mice) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories. All animal procedures were approved and performed in accordance with the Wistar Institute IACUC guidelines.Vaccines were injected i.m. into the quadriceps muscle. After 28 days, serum was collected by either subman- dibular bleeding or, if used for passive transfer into naive mice, cardiac bleeding, using serum collection tubes (Sarstedt). For passive transfer experiments, sera from each vaccine group were pooled ( n= 5), and na- ive mice were intraperitoneally injected with 150 mL pooled serum. After 4 h, serum was collected by sub- mandibular bleeding to determine whether antibodies were ef ciently transferred, and we excluded mice that had no detectable antibodies upon passive transfer. For some experiments, we anesthetized mice andthen intranasally infected them with 10,000 focus-forming units (FFU) of H3N2 viruses with the A/HongKong/4801/2014 HA diluted in sterile PBS, in a total volume of 50 mL. Mice were euthanized 2 days later for harvesting and homogenization of lungs and determination of in fluenza virus RNA levels. Focus reduction neutralization test. Serum samples were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) (Denka-Seiken) for 2 h at 37\u00b0C and heat inactivated for 30 min at 56\u00b0C before being serially diluted2-fold in minimal essential medium (MEM) (Gibco) starting at a 1:40 dilution. Viruses were diluted to a concentration of approximately 300 FFU per well and then incubated with serum for 1 h at room tem- perature. Con fluent monolayers of MDCK-SIAT1 cells were washed with MEM before virus-serum mix- tures were added to each well. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2and then washed with MEM, after which an overlay of 1.25% Avicel (Sigma) in supplemented with 0.2% gentamicin(Gibco) and 1% 1 M HEPES (Corning) was added to the cells. After an 18-h incubation at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2, cells were xed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then lysed with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Thomas Scienti c) in PBS for 7 min, followed by blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk powder in PBS. Plates were washed with water before 50 mL of antinucleoprotein monoclonal antibody IC5-1B7 (BEI) was added to each well. After incubation, plates were washed with water, and peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondaryantibody (MP Biomedicals) was added to each incubated and washed, and 3,3 9,5,5 0-tet- ramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate was the foci. Plates wereimaged and foci were quanti ed using an ELISpot reader. The 90% focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT 90) titers were reported as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum that reduced the number of foci by at least 90%, relative to control wells that had no serum.

ADCC reporter bioassay. The ADCC reporter bioassay kits (Promega) were used according to the manufacturer 's instructions. Brie fly, 293T cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding membrane- from wild-type Kong/4801/2014 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. The following day, the transfected cells were seeded at 3,000 cells per well on 96-well flat-bottom plates (Corning) and incubated overnight.

Medium from target 293T cells was removed, and 25 mL of assay buffer along with 25 mL of diluted serum was added to each well. ADCC effector cells expressing mouse FcgRIV cell surface receptor (Promega) were thawed and addedto plates at an effector/target cell ratio of 25:1. The plates were incubated for 6 h at 37\u00b0C. Cells and Bio- Glo luciferase substrate (Promega) were brought to room temperature, and 75 mL of substrate was added per well. Luminescence was read on an EnVision reader, and fold induction was calculated, afterbackground subtraction, as relative light units (RLU) from induced wells divided by RLU from no-serumcontrol wells. Statistical analysis. Data were compared between vaccine groups using one-way analysis of var- iance (ANOVA) and two-way ANOVA multiple comparisons method). Antibodytiters were log 2transformed and viral lung titers were log10transformed prior to analysis. Analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (version 7 or later). Pvalues of ,0.05 were considered statistically signi cant.
