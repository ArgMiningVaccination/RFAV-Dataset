[Ecoloxtech](https://cba4f1-2.myshopify.com?bg_ref=CmTgxVw99v) is a company who \"specializes in on-site electrolyzed water systems, to create a cleaner and safer future\". They work with medical facilities, cruise ships and more by supplying industrial sized hypochlorous acid machines to keep facilities clean, while also saving them a lot of money. I was super excited to see they also carry [smaller sized device](https://ecoloxtech.com/nvl9da) which are perfect for our treatment rooms! All you need is this device, tap water, salt and electricity to make a non-toxic and EPA approved environmentally friendly disinfectant, which is so gentle you can even use it as a hand sanitizer! I promise, you will never buy disinfectant again. I have purchased two, one for my home, and one for my treatment room, and it's honestly one of the best purchases I've made for both my health + pocketbook. Here are some ways in which I'm using this device in my treatment room and at home: - Save the gloves, because this disinfectant, unlike the others, is completely safe to get on the skin! - I no longer have to buy disinfectant, which saves me money and also limits the amount of plastic I'm buying. It's so much more sustainable! - Research is now showing how dangerous fragrance can be. Since this is literally salt and water, there are no harmful and irritating fumes, keeping my lungs and my clients' lungs happy and healthy. - I've officially ditched Barbacide. What traditionally took me 10 minutes to sanitize, now only takes two. You read that correctly, two minutes. And unlike Barbacide it doesn't have to be changed daily. I also like the fact that again, I'm not touching toxic chemicals and my mask brushes which touch my client's skin, aren't soaking in it. - If you run a \"green\" business, then this device should be a no brainer. You'll be able to honestly tell your clients, you're doing your part in creating a non-toxic and sustainable business environment. I've also really felt great about using this in my home. I can safely spray my son's toys to clean them, and I no longer have to make sure food is off the counter before cleaning. In fact, you can even spray your fruits and vegetables with it. I've been using it on fresh produce to move all mold spores which makes it last a whole lot longer! I'm also happy to report (since I'm mechanically challenged) that the device is easy to operate, and it comes with instructions. If you're wondering how water, salt and electricity can create such magic, I recommend checking out Ecoloxtech's webiste, but here is a quick overview. The active molecule is hypochlorous acid (HOCl) which is a powerful oxidant and is 100 times more efficient at killing bacteria than chlorine bleach or sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). Hypochlorous acid is safe and natural. It is found in our blood as one of the most powerful biological oxidants generated by our white blood cells against invading pathogens.
