Urvi Chowdhury is an undergraduate student at the University of Maryland, College Park majoring in Neurobiology and Physiology and minoring in Statistics. She hopes to pursue a career in the combined fields of medicine, public health, and global health in order to implement community and organizational based projects that reduce preventable health inequities. On campus, Urvi has been involved with UNICEF UMD to promote humanitarian education, advocacy, and fundraising for children and families around the world, ran a photojournalistic project series called \"Disability During COVID-19\" with Humans of College Park, and has served as a research assistant for Neuromechanics Research Core, a HLSC100 UTA, and a BSCI207 GSS Leader. Off campus, Urvi is a Community Projects Intern for United Against Inequities in Disease and a Crisis Text Line Counselor. Description of Research Paper: \"Eliminating Racial Bias from the 2021 CKD-EPI the usage of the 2021 CKD-EPI creatinine based equation in healthcare systems and how the algorithim's calculation of the eGFR ensures misdiagnosis of chronic kidney disease for Black patients, especially when declaring severity stage and treatment options. The proposal evaluates literature supporting the inclusion and exclusion of the racial coefficient factor from the CKD-EPI creatinine equation as well as the consequences of utilizing a creatinine based equation to calculate eGFR. Through a complex assessment of biology, mathematics, the social construction and complexities of \"race\", laboratory costs, and concerns of patient transparency, the proposal advocates for the utilization of a dual model eGFR algorithm that incorporates both creatinine and cystatin C equations. While health care worker burnout intensifies as a public health crisis during the COVID pandemic, a potential tech-based antidote helped two Terps, including ILS alum Veeraj Shah '21, walk away with the $30,000 grand prize at the 2022 Pitch Dingman Competition\u2014just five days after winning the University of Maryland's 2022 Do Good Challenge with the same app. Sanketh Andhavarapu '23, a neuroeconomics/individual studies and biological sciences major, and Veeraj Shah '21, a health policy and technology/individual studies and biological sciences major, were honored for their startup, Vitalize.

Congratulations to Jolie Quiros, an ILS graduating senior who was just named one of Maryland's Undergraduate Researchers of the Year! An outstanding student and researcher, Jolie Quiros will earn her Bachelor's of Science in Animal Sciences this May. Jolie has served diligently on the executive board of Minorities in Agriculture, Natural Sciences, and Related Sciences (MANRRS), participated in undergraduate research on campus, and received her honors citation from the Integrated Life Sciences Honors Program during her UMD tenure. After graduation, she will be attending veterinary school at Virginia Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine and hopes to become an emergency veterinarian. She will be recognized with a plaque and $1,000 award for this honor. A brief description of her research is below: Jolie joined the Taneyhill lab in the fall semester of 2019 and has been working there ever since. Before being sent home due to COVID, she was involved in chick embryo work under the supervision of Dr. Ankita Shah. Jolie learned how to open and stage eggs containing chick embryos, and also gained experience embedding these embryos and sectioning them using a cryostat. This work allowed for the frozen, embedded embryos to be sliced into extremely thin sections (13 microns) to then be used in immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. familiar with sectioned embryos under a confocal microscope. After Jolie was able to return to the lab, she began work with Dr. Leonard on mouse models. She contributed to Dr. Leonard's project looking at Elp1 in a conditional knockout model of Elp1 protein in the neural crest cells to serve as a model for the genetic disorder, Familial Dysautonomia. A crucial member of this project, Jolie aided in managing the mouse colony and in performing genotyping for the litters of mice to determine which animals were conditional knockouts. Additionally, she performed IHC assays and have obtained images for Dr. Leonard's publications on this project. November 2021 Grant Dong (B.S. '21), who is now with the Divers Alert Network conducting research on decompression sickness - a potentially deadly condition that can occur while scuba diving and is caused by bubbles of nitrogen gas forming in the blood and tissues. Grant credits the Honors College's Integrated Life Sciences (ILS) program with guiding him toward numerous opportunities for research, professional development and community during his time at UMD. In particular, he notes that ILS Associate Director Sabrina Kramer was (and continues to be) a strong advocate and mentor of his. Read more about Grant on the [CMNS website](https://cmns.umd.edu/news-events/features/4868). In this article, learn how Grant is merging his diving hobby with decompression sickness research - and how his passion for working with people has led him to pursue medical school. September 2021 ILS Awards The annual ILS Service Awards were recently earned by Clarissa Xia and Andrew Yi, congratulations! Clarissa Xia has been volunteering at the UMD Help Center, providing mental health support to peers via empathy, active listening, and crisis coping strategies. As well as volunteering with Terps Against Hunger as a Membership Chair, planning and executing the food packaging events as Co-President this year. She is also a Blood Donor ambassador for the American Red Cross and volunteered at Walter Reed hospital to support the patients. Andrew Yi has been working to assist the immediate and larger community through his involvement in the International Rescue Committee, Doctors Without Borders UMD Chapter and Nonprofit PGC. Clarissa Xia Andrew Yi The Peer Mentor award goes to Daniel Fong, who was nominated by his mentee for his outstanding advice, staying reachable, and encouraging. He explained everything about medical school applications and introduced wonderful opportunities, such as Public Health Beyond Borders. Daniel not only was reachable but also made sure to reach out, making sure that things are going well. The award for Outstanding Undergraduate Teaching goes to Apurva Raghu. She is a senior and a TA for a second year for BSCI 330H. She taught for the first time during the pandemic and for the first time, 330H was taught fully online. She also taught her own independent activity group (in her own room) on Fridays. She helped students by accommodating their own unique learning style, being patient and encouraging. The ILS Research Award goes to Kevin Hu. Kevin has been working in Dr. Jonathan Simon's lab since Fall 2019. He has worked on two neuroscience research projects investigating cross-frequency coupling in neural responses obtained from human subjects. Importantly and formatively for a young researcher, the first did not work out, not through any fault of his own (in fact despite his best efforts). The second project has been going beautifully (for the past year) and I expect it will soon end up being either a standalone paper(or an integral part of a multi-researcher paper). Dr. Jonathan Simon writes \"Kevin is not only performing true quantitative neuroscience research beyond the level of a new graduate student, but he has also shown great strength by not letting the end of his first project discourage him from taking on, and succeeding in, the second\". Another ILS Research Award goes to Grace Ge. Grace began working in the laboratory at the NIH in the summer of 2019. She did an excellent job in this introductory experience. Although they hoped to bring her back to the lab in the summer of 2020, COVID moved her to a virtual program starting in Fall 2020. Since that time, she has worked diligently on a computational project aimed at identifying new genes associated with elastic fiber production. The project was complex and would typically be performed by someone at the graduate level, but Grace tackled the study with great success. She will present the work at the NIH summer research symposium and they expect her efforts to lead to a first-author manuscript in the coming year. Dr. Kozel writed \"I have been lucky to have Grace in my group the past few years. She is intelligent, creative, inquisitive, and adaptable and has advanced the work of my research group. I believe she will make an excellent scientist in the coming years and deserves the ILS Outstanding Student Research Award\". ILS MENTOR AWARD goes to Dr. Beth Kozel, Grace's mentor. Dr Kozel is the head of the laboratory of Vascular and Matrix Genetics. Even though she is extremely busy, she made time for additional meetings to helps students and she encourages them to try different approaches to problem-solving. Her nomination says: \"Dr. Kozel is one of the nicest and most approachable people I've ever met, and I feel comfortable asking her for advice on everything from career options to balancing a demanding job with adult responsibilities. Dr. Kozel's approach to mentoring strikes the perfect balance of giving me responsibility and independence while still keeping me on the right track; as a result, I feel that I am beginning to experience the true nature of scientific research\". August 2021 Congratulations to ILS Assistant Director Ms. Zabrina Anzyl for being recognized as Academic Advisor of the Year for the 2020-2021 academic year! Ms. Anzyl was one of three advisors selected for this award across the university for her work building an inclusive, encouraging, and affirming community within the ILS program. She works primarily with first-year students and is known for empowering students to prioritize self-care in their student experience, leadership development, and 1:1 advising that covers everything from crisis to chronic health concerns and career guidance. The groundwork she laid for student wellness, the Peer Mentor Program, and staff accessibility were crucial for navigating the pandemic, and this bizarre year would have undoubtedly been more difficult without the structures she put in place. Her nomination noted that \"This has been a long year for all of us, but Zabrina has risen to the occasion and excelled.\" Zabrina has also engaged in an ongoing collaboration with students and leadership to increase ILS's inclusivity and equity for students from all identities, backgrounds, perspectives, and circumstances. Congratulations Zabrina! June 2021 Please join us in congratulating our former founder-director Dr. Todd Cooke in his official appointment as Emeritus Professor in CBMG starting July 1st. This is a well-deserved recognition of Todd's outstanding career and his many contributions to the department and the university in the areas of teaching, research, and service. Although Dr. Cooke started as a sociology and economics major (then history and literature, and then philosophy), senior-year science courses led Cooke to a National Science Foundation graduate fellowship and eventually a Ph.D. from Cornell. At UMD, he was hired for his research in plant development and evolution and has taught more than 15 different courses over the years. Collaborating with his colleagues, Cooke was instrumental in modernizing the botany/plant biology curriculum and his innovations brought a new, multidisciplinary perspective to life sciences education. In his 42 years at the University of Maryland, Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics Professor Todd Cooke has always had a passion for teaching. And he made it a personal mission to create opportunities for students to succeed. His style as a professor is hands-on and interactive, holding office hours in the Diner and looking for ways to keep students engaged, which made him very well-liked by his students. Of all his academic contributions, there's one he's most proud of Dr. Cooke founded and then directed the [Integrated Life Sciences](https://www.ils.umd.edu/) (ILS) program in the [Honors College](https://honors.umd.edu/) since 2011. ILS built an extraordinary track record of achievement, one student at a time. Read more about Professor Cooke's achievement [here](https://cmns.umd.edu/news-events/features/4655). May 2021 Congratulations to senior Sherry Fan, who was not only chosen to be a student speaker for the University of Maryland College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences' Spring 2021 Commencement Celebration, but also is a [university medalist!](https://www.commencement.umd.edu/speakers-honorees/university-medalist) Sherry Fan will graduate with bachelor's degrees in both biological sciences and nutrition and food science. The daughter of an immigrant from rural China, Fan grew up in Montgomery County, Md., hearing his stories about not having enough food or freshwater\u2014a motivation to seek ways to help those in dire need. She became a National Merit Scholarship finalist and earned a Banneker/Key Scholarship at the University of Maryland, where she joined the Food Recovery Network to reduce campus food waste and served meals at homeless shelters in Washington, D.C., as a member of UMD Tzu Ching . Moreover, Sherry worked for three years with Professor Wenxia Song on uncovering the cellular relationship between obesity, chronic inflammation and insulin resistance, and spent two summers interning at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. After graduation, Fan will pursue a dual M.D./Ph.D. at Cornell University and hopes to eventually work at an academic medical center to integrate service, research, art and teaching.

Dr. El-Sayed is a professor of cell biology and molecular genetics with a joint appointment in the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, as well as the ILS director as of spring 2020. For the first time ever on campus, UMD researchers will be able to access single-cell DNA and RNA sequencing technologies. \"The high-throughput and advanced large-scale genomics research made possible by the BBI-AGTC will greatly improve our capabilities in neuroscience and other life sciences in College Park,\" said [Elizabeth Quinlan](http://biology.umd.edu/elizabeth-quinlan.html), a professor of biology and director of the BBI. \"The facility is the first of a number of new BBI-administered cores that will enhance campus research by bringing to UMD new tools and technologies that can be applied to the nervous system.\" Single-cell genomic applications are becoming increasingly important for rare cell detection and the comprehensive classification of biological systems. \"Applications of these technologies include identifying new cell types in the human immune response and classifying cancers and their effects\u2014namely, the heterogeneity of cells within a tumor, the evolution of cancer colonies and the responses offered by tissues and cells to cancers' perturbations,\" noted El-Sayed. El-Sayed's research uses genomic approaches to study the biology of parasitism. His team develops and applies molecular, computational and systems biology tools to better understand host-pathogen interactions and, ultimately, the mechanisms of infection and survival. His work in functional genomics, tracing how biological information flows from gene to protein expression via RNA transcription, looks to contribute to better diagnosis, prevention of and therapeutics for parasite- and bacteria-caused diseases in humans, animals and plants. El-Sayed has published more than 90 research papers and serves on the editorial boards of BMC Genomics and PLoS One. He also serves on the National Institute of Health's Genomics, Computational Biology and Technology study section and the scientific advisory board for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases' Genomic Centers for Infectious Diseases.

[Dr. Maisel](https://bioe.umd.edu/clark/faculty/1012/Katharina-Maisel) is an Assistant Profession in the [Fischell Department of Bioengineering](https://bioe.umd.edu/). Dr. Maisle's research focuses on modeling and developing nanoparticle interactions and delivery systems for mucosal membranes. Dr. Maisle was nominated by her student, who writes, \"Dr. Maisel has been the best mentor I could ask for. I am so inspired by how dedicated she is to her research, while still making time for all of her graduate and undergraduate students. From the first day that I joined Dr. Maisel's lab, I felt like I was part of a family there. Dr. Maisel is incredibly selfless and committed to her students... She has helped me begin to figure out what a career in research would look like, and the steps that I should take to make that a reality. This was already impressive during the school year, but Dr. Maisel continued to encourage our lab to stay engaged with each other during the summer while everyone was working remotely. We had weekly social meetings where we all talked about everything from how we were coping with being shut in our homes, to the various recipes that we were all encouraging each other to try...I will always appreciate Dr. Maisel for providing me with such a wonderful opportunity to experience what research in bioengineering looks like. She will always be a role model and inspiration for me.\" Congratulations to Dr. Maisel and thank you for being such a supportive mentor and role model. We had such exceptional submissions for the ILS Service Award this year that we felt compelled to recognize the contributions of two students. Radhika Gholap is a graduating senior who has contributed to her community in numerous ways, including as a Level 5 Crisis Counselor for the Crisis Text Line, which is a national tool that connects individuals navigating mental health crises, abusive relationships, anxiety, and more with appropriate resources. As part of her work with Terps for Change, Radhika has worked with community partner CASA-Mi Espacio mentoring Hispanic youth. Additionally she works with patients at the Howard County Office of Aging and the Weinberg Women's Health Clinic. She is also the co-President of AMSA and an ILS Mentor for the second year. Alythis Vo is a junior who has dedicated many hours to the mission of combating food insecurity in her community through the Campus Pantry, Food Recovery Network, and the Capital Area Food Bank since her first year of college. She went to Harlan, KY for an Alternative Break trip and saw firsthand how food insecurity was just on repercussion of economic circumstances in that region. Additionally, she volunteers regularly with the Pregnancy Aid Center in College Park, Latino Health Initiatives in Montgomery County, and has been making COVID test kits with Quest since the pandemic began. Radhika Gholap Alythis Vo ILS RESEARCH AWARD goes to Chaitali Chitnis, who was nominated by her mentor, Dr. Andrea Simone Baechler. Chatali worked with Dr. Baechler at the Developmental and Therapeutics Branch of the National Cancer Institute for two years. Dr. Baechler wrote, \"Although I am highly selective when accepting students, I could not have hoped for a better student to work with me... Indeed, she has been one of these exceptionally rare students, who are willing to run several extra miles to achieve outstanding results. For instance, she initiated a review of the literature on inflammatory responses in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Building off this work, she developed her own theoretical hypothesis and translated these insights into numerous experiments. Strikingly, she identified how deficiency of mitochondrial topoisomerase I provokes an inflammatory response in the liver. To put this finding into context: her work easily compares to advanced graduate level work. It is truly exceptional and remarkable! Chaitali certainly ranks amongst the very best students that I ever had the privilege to work with (i.e., Top 1%)...A particularly intriguing aspect has been her ability to critically reflect on her own work and identify compelling solutions to pressing challenges. Finally, her hardworking mentality and first-class work ethics made Chaitali an extremely promising student and future researcher. Besides these outstanding personal credentials, which are all together truly important, I am deeply impressed by her determination and kind personality. In fact, Chaitali belongs to the rare group of students, who are not only gifted with excellent scientific skills and abilities, but also excel through a kind personality and deep social engagement. One of her most notable personal characteristics is that she is genuinely passionate about scientific research and furthering the greater public good...\" Each year, students can be nominated by their peers, their students or their supervisors as outstanding undergraduate teachers. This is the first year that we have two award winners. David Rekhtman was nominated for his work as a UTA for BSCI 330H. He is teaching the course for the second time this fall. Last year, David helped to revise exams, and streamline grading to make it faster and more equitable among the UTAs. This past summer, David spent many hours working with Dr. Kramer to develop an online learning environment for BSCI330H which maintained the previous active learning structure along with regular assignments and formative assessment. He volunteered his time in the summer to move assignments into ELMS quizzes, set up deadlines, and now works with students weekly to go over problem sets and check student learning. Dr. Kramer wrote, \"There is a lot that goes into designing and running a good course. David was instrumental in improving Cell Biology and moving it online well. With his help, the class incorporates what we know helps student learn: regular low-stakes formative assessments, active learning, and lots of opportunities to for students to work with teachers. I'm proud of Cell Biology, and if it wasn't for David it just wouldn't be as good a class this year. David is thoughtful, caring, and selfless when it comes to his time, and I am very lucky to have him as one of my UTAs.\" Josh Steighner was nominated for his outstanding work as an undergraduate teaching assistant (UTA) for genetics (HLSC 322). He has been a UTA for this course for two years and will be returning for a third year this coming spring. He was nominated both by student and a fellow UTA. He was the only experienced UTA in HLSC 322 with an instructor new to the course, Dr. Pick and when the course had to abruptly move to a fully online format last spring along with the rest of the campus. He was instrumental in making sure the face-to-face discussion moved online smoothly, as well as bringing his experience and knowledge to the table to help fellow UTAs with their lesson plans. One of his students wrote, \"He responded to our email quickly and was really supportive when we switched to online learning...Josh went above and beyond as a UTA for our class which I truly appreciate.\" june 2020 ILS founding director Dr. Todd Cooke steps down Dr. Todd Cooke, the founder of the Integrated Life Sciences Program who launched this visionary experiment in 2011, has stepped down from the Director role to spend more time conducting research in his greenhouses. An innovative and perceptive scientist, Dr. Cooke is renown for his life chats, mentorship, office hours in the Stamp and the Diner, and modern pedagogy. He aspired to train the next generation of talented scientists across disciplines, and grew ILS from 50 brave students in the inaugural cohort to nearly double that in almost a decade. Students from ILS have gone on to earn admission to the top graduate and professional schools in the country, rack up awards for research, service, and scholarship, earn fellowships and internships to world-class organizations on the cutting edge of innovation, and use their myriad talents to contribute to a better world. Todd was always available to lend an ear to a career path crisis, give extra help in organismal biology, and affirm for students that their path was as unique as they were with a millions ways to be successful and happy, and not just a linear trajectory to travel. Todd's accolades over the years include a Guggenheim Fellowship and a College Teaching Excellence award, plus three Center for Teaching Excellence-Lilly Foundation Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching awards for designing and/or implementing innovative undergraduate courses. Dr. Cooke was named a Life Science Education Fellow of the National Academies for 2009-2010. Todd we will miss you very much, but are so grateful for your tremendous contributions to science, Maryland, and the greater world. We are honored to carry ILS forward with the foundation you carefully built, and we promise to always \"run the experiment.\" Enjoy your plants! eddie zhang named Fulbright scholar Congratulations to Eddie Zhang, who was just named a Fulbright Scholar! When Edwin Zhang arrived at the University of Maryland as a freshman in the fall of 2015, he knew that being a [biological sciences](https://bsci.umd.edu/) major would offer him a world of academic possibilities. He knew about the potential research opportunities and chances to showcase his work. What he did not know is that he would fall in love with an entirely different part of the educational experience: teaching. Now, as a recipient of the prestigious Fulbright Scholarship, Zhang will have the opportunity to take his love of teaching international as an English teaching assistant in Taiwan. \"I really, really enjoy teaching. It's something I was doing three to four days out of the week, in addition to my studies,\" said Zhang, who graduated in May 2020 with his bachelor's degree. \"When I learned about the Fulbright English Teaching Assistant Program through the [Honors College](https://www.honors.umd.edu/), I applied because it seemed like a great opportunity and lined up with what I enjoy doing.\" Zhang began teaching during his freshman year when he volunteered with the [Maryland Family Literacy Program](http://thestamp.umd.edu/Leadership_Community_Service-Learning/Programs/Maryland_Mentor_Corps/Maryland_Family_Literacy_Program). He helped elementary-school students learn to read and also helped parents\u2014often immigrants\u2014learn how to better support their children's literacy. Zhang's parents are Chinese immigrants, so being able to support these families in this way was special to him. \"I enjoy working with kids,\" Zhang said. You can read more about Eddie and his work [here.](https://cmns.umd.edu/news-events/features/4605) April 2020 ilsers serve their communities in unique ways during COronavirus Service is a core tenet of the ILS program, and all of our students commit to a community partner for a standard number of hours to support that partner's mission in their first year. Several ILS students have been inspired to meet the emergent needs of their communities during the coronavirus global pandemic in creative and thoughtful ways. Amid the disruption of education across the state, first-year Angela Sun, and senior Sanyukta Deshmukh, a BIOE pre-health major, have launched tutoring support services to match eager tutors with students to coach them in subjects K-12. The tutors interface virtually with their students for free, and are likely a welcome tool for students and to parents thrown into at-home education for the first time. First-years Chase Singer, a Physiology and Neurobiology pre-med major, and Zain Shamsuddin, a BIOE pre-health major organized a flyer campaign and food drive to tackle food insecurity for their neighbors. They created a plan to advertise a request for donations, then to collect and deliver them to local food banks. These are just a few examples and everyone's circumstances are different, and it's really wonderful to see these young scientists meeting a need where they can. ILS ALUMS win National Science Foundation graduate fellowships The National Science Foundation (NSF) has just announced that 3 ILS alumni - Lily Durkee (Ecology, 2018), Mariya Shevchuk (Chemical Engineering, 2018), and Caitlyn Singam (Systems Engineering, 2020) - have been awarded the prestigious NSF Graduate Fellowships that will support their Ph.D.studies in their respective disciples.

Astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) will carry out the experiment that tests bacteria's ability to grow on different surfaces in microgravity. Their experiment was selected from numerous proposals by UMD's Student Spaceflight Experiments Program (SSEP), known as Terps in Space. The team members, Debbie Adam, Michelle Fang, Niki Gooya, Swarnapali \"Pali\" Keppetipola and Apurva Raghu are all members of the Integrated Life Sciences program in the Honors College, and are all rising sophomores. This is the second ILS team in three years to be selected for their experiment to be launched into space. Each of them took pride in being a member of an all-female research team. \"I'm extremely proud of our team because the participation of women in science is not as prominent as it should be,\" Adam said. \"The fact that we have made it this far is really important to me.\" Gooya was the first of the group to enter the space race. \"I participated in SSEP in eighth grade, although my team's project did not get sent to space,\" said Gooya, who attended Burleigh Manor Middle School in Ellicott City, Maryland. \"When I found that Maryland participated in the program, I jumped on it and got my friends to join me.\" The students designed an experiment to study slimy layers of bacteria called biofilms. Biofilms stick to each other and to virtually any surface more strongly than a single bacterium can. They are difficult to get rid of and can lead to human illness. Previous research has also shown that biofilms grow more readily in microgravity, making them an important issue to address on the ISS.

October 2018 Five ILSers on Gold-Medal Winning Research team at the iGEM Jamboree Each year, the world produces over 300 million pounds of plastics; yet, according to a 2018 United Nations report, more than one-third of all plastic is used in materials that are thrown away after a single use, and less than 10 percent is ever recycled. The explosion in worldwide plastic production - a reality that is little more than a half-century old - has led to extensive pollution, threatening human health, wildlife, water, and the Earth's climate. Recognizing this, an interdisciplinary team of 12 University of Maryland students, whose project is known as PETNET, is employing new tactics in search of a scalable solution for breaking down polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the world's most commonly used plastic. The team - which earned a gold medal at this year's International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition in Boston, Mass. - worked to address critical shortcomings that have long eluded researchers on a quest to rid the world of plastic waste. Even more, the group developed a system using a biosensor that could allow researchers to carry out routine measurements of PET degradation without relying on expensive lab equipment to do so. \"The buildup of plastics is a challenging issue that lacks a simple solution,\" said biochemistry and biological sciences double major Jacob Premo, a UMD iGEM team member. \"While recycling can help to counteract plastic waste accumulation, it is limited in scope to only certain types of plastic that are of a sufficient crystallinity. Our team decided to attempt to create a solution to this issue by optimizing an enzyme-based breakdown of PET.\" You can read more [here.](https://bioe.umd.edu/news/story/umd-igem-team-awarded-gold-medal-for-plastic-degradation-project) september 2018 Veeraj Shah wins the 2018 ThermoFisher Scientific Antibody Scholarship A second-year ILS student, Veeraj Shah, has just been awarded the 2018 ThermoFisher Scientific Antibody Scholarship.

He also serves as an AGNR Student Ambassador, as an EMT with the Hyattsville Fire Department, and as an alternative spring break leader, among numerous activities. ILSer continues tradition, earning A Howard Hughes Medical Institute Research Fellowship Congratulations to Uzair Ahtesham, who earned the prestigious Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Undergraduate Research Fellowships. HHMI Fellowships are awarded to undergraduate students who are achieving research excellence in the biomedical sciences. For more information about the HHMI programs at the University of Maryland, see http://hhmi.umd.edu. Uzair's research explores ethylene, a multifunctional plant hormone that is tightly controlled in the agricultural industry due to its wide ranging effects on crop plants. The recently published genome sequence of Marchantia reveals homologs of the proteins for ethylene signaling, but there are no homologs of the enzyme known in flowering plants to be responsible for producing ethylene from the precursor molecule 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC). Preliminary results indicate that ACC induces responses in Marchantia that are distinct from those caused by ethylene, suggesting that ACC itself could be a signaling molecule. Uzair investigates the roles of ethylene and ACC in Marchantia, to determine if the homologs of the ethylene signaling pathway are functionally conserved, and to shed light on the unknown signaling pathway through which ACC functions.

UMD students second only to stanford in past five years Congratulations to ILS junior Lily Sun, who has just been awarded a Goldwater Scholarship! The [Barry Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Foundation](https://goldwater.scholarsapply.org/), which encourages students to pursue advanced study and careers in the sciences, engineering and mathematics. Lily is one of four UMD students named as a Goldwater Scholar, and she contributes to a legacy of 18 awards and 2 honorable mentions for 20 nominated students in the past five years. Stanford University is the only other institution in the nation to match UMD's standards in this timeframe. Lily is among the 211 Barry Goldwater Scholars selected from 1,280 students nominated nationally this year, and she plans to pursue an M.D./Ph.D. after graduation. Lily Sun, a junior pursuing double degrees in [biological sciences](http://bsci.umd.edu/) and [economics](https://www.econ.umd.edu/) who is also a member of the [Integrated Life Sciences](http://www.ils.umd.edu/) program in the [Honors College](http://www.honors.umd.edu/) and a [Banneker/Key Scholar](http://www.bannekerkey.umd.edu/)\u2014is interested in developing novel cancer vaccines. Sun's pursued her first research experience in high school when she interned at the [National Cancer Institute's Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine](https://cam.cancer.gov/). As part of her internship, she screened a library of herbal compounds for potential use in chemotherapy. Next, she interned at the [National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders](https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/) (NIDCD) researching the effectiveness of certain antibodies for immunotherapy\u2014treatments that stimulate a patient's immune system\u2014to treat head and neck cancers. After joining another NIDCD lab in December 2016, Sun improved the effectiveness of a cancer immunotherapy in vitro by first treating cancer cells with chemotherapy drugs. Because chemotherapy usually kills immune cells along with cancer cells, making immunotherapy treatments less effective, this finding surprised Sun and her colleagues. As a result of this work, Sun co-authored two papers published in the journal OncoImmunology and submitted two more papers for publication, including a first-author paper. Sun and her collaborators are currently investigating the mechanism behind this unexpected effect. \"Lily possesses a remarkable ability to grasp complex biologic processes and critically think through experimental designs to answer hypothesis-based questions that guide a scientific story,\" said her mentor [Clint Allen](https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/about/staff/clint-t-allen-md), head of the NIDCD's Translational Tumor Immunology Program and an assistant professor in the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Sun founded Terps for New Horizons, a club dedicated to helping immigrants and refugees. For more information about all of the winners, please click here.

ILS alternative break trip, terps helping turtles, wraps up another great year in topsail island, NC Terps Helping Turtles Alternative Spring Break just returned from the Karen Beasley Sea Turtle Rescue & Rehabilitation Center in Topsail, NC! Check out the blog of the students' journey [here.](http://tht2018.blogspot.com/) ILSers on grand prize-winning team for 2018 pitch dingman competition for innovative fall detection device Congratulations to Symbiont Health, a team comprised of ILSers Maria Chen and Nick Hricz with Honors EIP students Erich Meissner, Kyle Liu, and Daniel Rosenberry for winning the $15,000 grand prize at the [2018 Pitch Dingman Competition](https://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/news/symbiont-health-wins-umd-pitch-dingman-competition-chaired-robert-hisaoka)! Chaired by businessman and philanthropist Robert G. Hisaoka, the competition awarded nearly $30,000 in seed funding to top student entrepreneurs in a \"Shark Tank\"-style pitch session, hosted by the Dingman Center for Entrepreneurship at the Robert H. Smith School of Business. Nearly 600 students, faculty, alumni and VIPs gathered to watch the student entrepreneurs pitch their businesses to the expert panel of judges in a ballroom at the university's Stamp Student Union. The judges assessed each startup's current level of success, plan for using the funds and their overall growth potential. The winners were: $15,000 Grand Prize: Symbiont Health (founders Erich Meissner '18, Maria Chen '19 and Kyle Liu '20), maker of automated fall detection devices for seniors $7,500 Second Prize: BEEQBOX (founder Brianna Queen '19), a vegan cruelty-free cosmetics company featuring feminist branding $3,500 Third Prize: Dark Sonar Technologies (founder George Lee '18), a cybersecurity company that prevents synthetic identity fraud on websites and mobile apps $1,000 Audience Choice (decided by text voting): Flee (founder Didac Hormiga '19), a mobile app that helps students discover events and entertainment around campus February 2018 ILSer wins prestigious churchill scholarship, first from UMD since 1963 Congratulations to ILS senior Yousuf Khan, who was just awarded the prestigious [Churchill Scholarship,](https://cmns.umd.edu/news-events/features/4086) which offers full funding to pursue a 1-year Master's degree at the University of Cambridge. Nationally, only 15 students in the sciences, engineering or mathematics receive Churchill Scholarships annually. Only two UMD students previously received the award since its inception in 1963, and this is the first time two were selected in the same year. The other UMD Churchill recipient this year is Chris Bambic from the University Honors program. Yousuf will pursue a Master of Philosophy degree in pathology. He plans to study programmed ribosomal frameshifting in eukaryotic organisms. This mechanism allows organisms to pack a larger amount of genetic information into a relatively short sequence of RNA. \"Yousuf is truly exceptional and ranks in the top 1 percent among the students I have taught and mentored at the University of Maryland,\" said [Zhongchi Liu](https://cbmg.umd.edu/faculty/zhongchiliu/), a professor in the [UMD Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics](http://cbmg.umd.edu/) who invited Khan to work in her plant genetics lab while he was still in high school. After enrolling at UMD, Khan spent three years in the laboratory of [Jonathan Dinman](http://cbmg.umd.edu/faculty/jonathand-dinman/), chair of the [UMD Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics](http://cbmg.umd.edu/), studying ribosomal frameshifting and how non-coding RNA controls gene expression. Khan cloned sequences suspected of being able to reprogram the genetic code and determined whether the sequences had the frameshifting function. As a result, he validated several new frameshifting sequences and co-authored five peer-reviewed journal articles and spoke about his findings at the American Association for Cancer Research's annual meeting in 2017. \"By targeting and manipulating these very basic, but important, molecular mechanisms, this research could lead to the development of therapeutics to combat diseases and to mitigate the effects of aging,\" Khan said. To broaden his research experiences this year, Khan joined the laboratory of [UMD Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics](http://cbmg.umd.edu/) Professor [Norma Andrews](https://cbmg.umd.edu/faculty/normaandrews/) to study Leishmania parasites, which are found in parts of the tropics, subtropics and southern Europe. They can cause serious disease and even death. Khan is examining the role of iron and reactive oxygen species in regulating differentiation of these parasites. He co-authored a peer-reviewed journal article detailing how to infect macrophages with these parasites and is preparing to submit a first-author publication. Congratulations Yousuf! October 2017 President Loh's Fall Video Message: Discover New Knowledge Check out ILSer Megha Guggari at the 1:48 minute mark of President Loh's video message! She and and her team are highlighted for their innovative, portable machine that analyzes brain waves in the fight against Alzheimer's disease. Awesome work Megha! David Goff Scholarship Announcement ILS is thrilled to announce that the Honors College will be offering the David Goff Scholarship to one second-year ILS student in the Fall 2017 semester. Students interested in pursuing the $1,000 scholarship must have a GPA of 3.75 or higher, be strongly committed to pursing a career in medicine (e.g., clinical medicine, medical research, public health, or another allied health field), and complete an application that includes an essay, curriculum vitae, and letter of recommendation. For any questions and complete application, ILS students must contact Dr. Todd Cooke, Director of the ILS Program in the Honors College. September 2017 terp magazine profiles TERP Magazine has profiled several members of the talented incoming class in the online issue available [here.](http://terp.umd.edu/the-incredibles/#.Wa7rftOGMWo) Two of these new Terps profiled by Lauren Brown are ILSers: Ethan Cheng and Pavan Ravindra. Ethan Cheng believes every child should be able to smile. Born with a cleft lip, he founded the Cleft Support Club at his Montgomery County high school to raise awareness and money for children in developing countries who need the surgery to repair the birth defect, which can cause speech, dental and eating problems. A biological sciences major in the Honors College Integrated Life Sciences program, Cheng had his first surgery at age 3 months, and says it's important that all children with cleft lips or palates have that opportunity: \"It's a simple surgery, but it can really change people's lives.\" In the time it takes most of us to put on our pants, Pavan Ravindra can solve a Rubik's Cube. One-handed. Ravindra, who plans to double major in biological sciences and computer science while participating in the Honors College ILS program, last year held the national title in this niche competition. He unscrambled the device five times at an average 11 seconds, with a top speed of 9.26 seconds. He insists it's more efficient to use just his left hand, saying his movements are so fast that keeping the right hand out of the way can help shave up to a second off his \"solve time.\" Ravinindra solved his first Rubik's Cube in fourth grade, then put it aside for five years until he met a classmate who could do it in 15 seconds. That teen showed him a few tricks, and by the end of the school year, Ravindra could beat him. But the secret to his speed and dexterity is no trick it all: \"It just means three hours a day of practice.\" ILS Service Award Recipients Congratulations to our two recipients of the 2017 ILS Service Award, Paula Kleyman and Kelsey Anderson! The ILS Service Award recognizes the considerable contributions that ILSers make to their communities with their time, talent, and innovation during their tenure at Maryland. There were such tremendous nominations this year that for the first time ever we bestowed two awards. Paula is a junior whose nominator described her as \"someone who makes the ILS community and university at large a better place because of her honesty, kindness, and hard work.\" Generating excitement and interest in science for the next generation of scientists is one of Paula's passions. An active member of the American Chemical Society, and she volunteers to tutor students at various events.
