Ayurveda goes after the root cause which will have a more longstanding effect. Ayurveda allows you to take the reins of your own health. You don't have to wait for a prescription or undergo unnecessary tests. For example, if you normally have a pattern of getting a little constipated in fall, then prior to fall you would start eating more warm cooked moderately spiced foods, ingest more healthy oils, take in more water and warm herbal teas, return to a more regular routine, avoid cold & drying foods. Vikruti is your current imbalance, and Prakruti is your basic constitution you were conceived with. In Ayurveda, we are unwinding the vikruti (imbalance) and returning you to your prakruti (basic constitution). These are the subcategories of the Vata Dosha. Vata is responsible for movement, and each vayu governs a different aspect of movement of prana. Note that prana vayu is different from prana. Prana by itself refers to vital life force energy; prana vayu refers to the movement of prana or vital life force energy into the head and chest areas from the crown. What it is: Prana is our vital life force energy. Prana animates life; it is what brings us to life. Death is prana leaving the body. Prana infuses every cell and tissue with energy. Prana animates our prakruti. It is the energetic and creative aspect of consciousness. The whole universe is a manifestation of prana. Sources of prana include: air, earth, sun. Since plants grown in the earth and take in sunlight, they contain massive amounts of prana. Eating local, organic, fresh plants yields large amounts of prana. Pranayama in yoga or breath exercises also bring in prana. Ways to increase Prana: breath exercises (pranayama), spend time outdoors, exercise, surround yourself with high vibration people, eat lots of local, organic, seasonal whole foods, walk barefoot on the earth, chanting How can I control and concentrate Prana? there are yogic practices of using breath retentions, bandhas (locks), kriyas, visualizations, and meditations to harness Prana How does prana enter the body? When we born into this life, prana enters the adipati marma point at the top of the head when the fontanels are separated. Prana enters the body thru the 5 senses. Prana comes into the body from the food we eat, the air we breathe, and from absorbing the energies of the earth and heavens. Prana travels through thousands of tiny channels called nadis to every cell in the body. All yoga systems work with Prana, or energy. In Tantra Yoga, we work with mastering prana in order to master the mind, rather than working with the mind directly. You lie on the bathroom floor on your left side, insert the enema tubing or bottle filled with medicated oil or tea, and then hold it for as long as you can. Once you get the urge to defecate, you will then use the toilet to release the oil or tea. You then wear pad or disposable underpants overnight to catch any leaking oil or tea. You are fine to wear your normal undergarments the next morning. PanchaKarma means 5 actions. The 5 possible actions that may be used in panchakarma are: The removal of toxins is part of every PK. It is important to note that the therapies are powerful in PK and there must be a period of clearing out the body before moving into a full PK Most people lose weight on a panchakarma. It varies greatly depending on what was in the diet prior to the PK. PK primes the body for more significant weight loss especially if you stay with a simple diet for a longer period of time. According to studies of the National Institute of Health in 2002: People generally feel some fatigue and may experience mild flu like symptoms if there are a lot of toxins being released. If the person does not do the proper preparatory work before the Panchakarma, then the toxins may flood the system too quickly and cause the person to develop strong flu symptoms. The simple diet consists of cooked grains, moong beans or some other lentil, and cooked vegetables. Avoid cold foods, yeast, fats, dairy, processed foods, alcohol, foods with high sugar. Yes, people can do their own body treatments. The preparatory phase is generally 4 days to several weeks. The actual cleanse itself takes 4 to 14 days. The Post phase of slowing reintroducing your normal foods can take anywhere from 1-4 weeks. Your ayurvedic professional will determine which of the 5 actions (vomiting, purgation, enemas, nasal oil, bloodletting) are appropriate for you. "}
