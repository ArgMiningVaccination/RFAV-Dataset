Since ancient times.... The battle of Kalinge transformed Ashoka, the Great (268-223 BC) from a ruthless cruel leader to a kind, gentle person. He was sincerely grieved to witness first-hand, the huge number of casualties caused by his military campaigns. He brought about a number of changes and established the first known animal rights laws. In his edicts, King Ashoka expresses his concern about the number of animals killed and made his intentions very clear to end such killings. He therefore, stopped royal hunting parties and also ended the killing of animals for the royal kitchen. He outlawed the sacrifice of animals and made it illegal to kill many species such as parrots, ducks, geese, turtles, monkeys and rhinos. He established wells and watering holes, places of rests and hospitals for humans and animals alike. I n addition, Ashoka taught his people to have compassion for animals and to refrain from harming or killing them. He prohibited forests from being burned to protect the creatures living in them. In one of his famous pillar edicts, he declared , \"I have enfor ced the law against killing animals. The greatest progress of righteousness among men comes from the exhortation in favour of non-injury to life and abstention from killing living beings. \" Isn't this a different and unknown facet of King Ashoka's personality? In recent times, a unique Bird Hospital in Delhi has caught everyone's eye. Tourists from India and abroad, school children and bird lovers visit this place. Our very own Bird Hospital So many times we come across wounded and sick birds, but ignore them because we do not have the knowledge of where to take them for proper treatment an d cure. We see birds electrocuted in electric wires, dehydrated during summers, wounded during storms, tree felling, aircraft collisions, etc. They too have the right for treatment and recuperation. One such unique hospital 3 which provides all facilities for treatment of wounded birds free of cost is the Bird's Hospital in Chandni Chowk, in Delhi, established in the year 1929. It is a one of its kind charitable hospital for birds, constructed by the funds voluntarily donated by the businessmen of Del hi. Eagles, crows, small birds are treated by the doctors and released into the sky to spread their wings and fly. The main objective of the hospital is to save the bird, within 24 hours. There is also a hospice of birds on the roof of the hospital. The birds stay here for a while, take rest, eat grains, drink water and fly away to their destinations. Also, an Out Patient Department (OPD) is arranged for the treated birds which do not wish to leave this place, inside the hospital. It has separate wards for different species of birds like sparrows, crows, parrots, pigeons and domestic fowls. It has a research laboratory and even an intensive care unit for its serious patients. Transported in bags or clasped between hands, 30-40 birds arrive in a day. In summers, they are often dehydrated or injured by moving fans and in winter they suffer from pneumonia. The winged patients can seek a remedy for everything from pigeon pox to the common cold. The birds are first kept held in the intensive care unit and are then transferred to the general wards, where they regain their wings and eventually fly off. So the next time, when you visit Delhi, regale in the splendor of the historic Red Fort, witness the hustle and bustle of the markets of Chandni Chowk and walk in to the Bird Hospital to generate a compassionate spark within you. Small birds and creatures need tender love and care, but the big animals also need to be looked after. It is our responsibility to ensure that they are not abused in any way for experiment or for entertainment. When it comes to pain, love, joy, fear or loneliness, both animals and humans feel the same. The big mammal needs care too ..... From time immemorial, elephants have been an integral part of history, tradition, myths and culture of India and Kerala in particular. One cannot imagine a festival in 'God's Own Country' without the presence of an elephant. Just like dogs or cats, these bi g mammals are also considered pets. Have you ever thought of bathing an elephant in a lush green forest across the back waters? Wouldn't it bring a smile on your f ace to watch these jumbos have their ceremonious bath in the water reservoirs and to watch the 4 A loyal companion for a brave warrior big and small elephants dip joyfully, squirting water on each other? If yes, then visit the Elephant Rehabilitation Centre in Kerala where they are cared for and their injuries treated. Some of the elephants are abandoned by the circuses when they grow too o ld for the job or are simply rescued from maltreating owners. One of the major highlights of these Elephant Orphanages is the chai n free life these mammals enjoy- freed to roam in well protected vicinities surrounded by trenches to keep wild animals at bay. For the sick and injured elephants, these centres are like retirement homes- comfortable zones where they are looked after by a team of experts. So, next time how you would like to see this beautiful animal- in chains or free A unique hospital Down Under....

Historians have immortalised the brave horse, Chetak of Maharana Pratap in the pages of history books through poems, folktales and local stories. Let's read about his antics on the battle field and his dedication to his master whom he did not leave till his last breath. Here's a story of a legendary king and his battles. But it's also a story about a horse...beautiful, spirited, intelli gent and loyal. 5 History claims that Maharana Pratap Singh was one of the 10 strongest warriors ever born in India. The Battle of Haldi Ghati in June 1576 saw his forces decisively outnumbered by the Mughal army led by Man Singh. Mounted on his favourite horse Chetak, Maharana Pratap charged towards the commander of the Mughal army and made a frontal attack on Man Singh's elephant. Once near , Chetak reared high in the air and planted his hooves on the forehead of the elephant. This was a turning point in the battle. In the general chaos that followed, Chetak received a fatal wound on one of his legs. An elephant's tusk tore through his rear legs and crippled it. But he would not give up. With his wounded king on the saddle, Chetak made his way back to safety on his three good legs. People do not remember the defeat of Maharana Pratap , but the courage and valour of his men and his horse. Chetak was exhausted but laboured on, carrying his master, about 2 miles from the site of the battle near a small stream. It was here, while trying to leap across the stream that Chetak collapsed. The Maharana erected a small monument for his loyal companion at the place where he fell and till date we pay a tribute to this brave warrior and his brave horse, Chetak. According to historians, Chetak a small horse had a certain blue tinge and hence in the local folklores, Maharana Pratap is often referred as the ' Rider of the Blue Horse'. In fact, many claim that the horse had a well defined personality, almost like his master himsel f. When it came to traits and behavior, Chetak was no less than his proud owner and thus a unique emotional bond existed between the two. Till date ballads, songs, poems are dedicated to honour this brave and valiant horse and immortalize him in the pages of history. Here is a folklore on Chetak - a paean ... Three Legged Dark Blue Horse About brave battles and true grit When all that history is writ There will sit saddled, one great name Within the heroes' hall of fame The horse Chetak's, a Marwari A breed that would the least tarry. Three things are known of Marwari A battle horse of victory. That, its speed forges a path free, In danger helps the rider flee. That, man wounded, is not alone, And dead, astride he would reach home. Reared up the horse and brave man Above those blades, a daring plan Leapt and struck the elephant's head Missed Singh, but mahout died instead The plan totally misfired Horse a nd king men -locked and mired. One foreleg of Chetak got cut Three legged he managed to butt Three legged he ran just as fast Two miles from that battlefield past His croup read Rana's horsemanship Snaking, wobbling, frothing at lip. Chetak galloped, flew off a cliff 6 One such, wit h such a human heart Would not from his rider be part Was, Chetak bred of faculty To serve with love and loyalty The horse friend of Rana Pratap When battle turned hazard of hap. So unlike, the rest of his breed He was the rarest of a steed Not b lack, not grey, not bald of pie Still strange dark blue of darkened sky The brave king, renowned was of course Called 'Rider of the Dark Blue Horse'. Chetak's amble and limbs were fine His hooves of dynamics divine When times the Rana rode a course Folks vied to catch a glimpse perforce Yet, they caught sight of, just blue tinge When Chetak raced, his sight would sing One Imperial Majesty Stoked battle at Haldigati Mughal Man Singh, war exponent Strode atop an elephant Fitted with wheels of s word -long -blades No charge could break his armoured glade. Thus, Haldigathi battlefield Where Rana's men fought not to yield Saw them go down like pins unkempt So Rana made his last attempt A path through Mughal soldiers traced With Chetak towards Ma n Singh raced. Three legged flight, a challenge sti ff Safe banks of the stream he touched Then shuddered hard and sideways lurched The stunned Rana giving God thanks Saw Chetak drop on the stream -banks. Towards Rana's lap, inched his head Whinnied soft, snapped his breath, lay dead \"My three legged friend! You are gone! Why !? You never left me alone!!\" Wept the Rana and held him close Kissed his wet face and stroked his nose. The Rana escaped to return Goading grand battles from heartburn When dusts and scores did down settle In honour of Chetak's mettle The Rana raised a monument Still marks that spot where Chetak went. Folklore etched their names in gold Paeans are sung, stories told Of rider and the brave blue horse Now, more renowned the horse of course In harness he died, one great name Years pass, but not that horse's fame. 2016 Republic Day parade at Rajpath saw a unique regiment of 36 Indian Canine soldiers consisting of Labradors and German Shepherds marching past the dignitaries and spectators. They were cheered because they were smart, confident and loyal dogs... a man's best companion in trying times. 7 Dressed in bold stripes of maroon and gold, the colours of the Army Regiment, these impressive dogs are trained for explosive and mine detection, tracking, assault, guard duty and infantry patrol. The Officer in Command said, \"Keeping in mind these requirements, we select the dog on the basis of their alertness, temper, aggressiveness and execution of command. Since, they take part in operations with us and have helped save the lives of so many soldiers; it was a policy decision to showcase canines.\" Since these dogs are not used to the increased noise level that prevail in cities, a special training session was held. The handlers had been training with them thrice a day so that they get used to the environment and remain calm. The Army also maintains documents pertaining to all aspects of the dogs. The Remount Vete rinary Corps (RVC), a regiment of the Indian Army has won gallantry awards and has made the country proud when they made the supreme sacrifice of valiantly fighting a group of heavily armed infiltrators in the high altitude area along the Line of Control. Hats off to these brave soldiers and their even braver and ever loyal companions! Demonstrating trustwort hiness by purity, honesty, sincerity and integrity.... One day in the 1890s, a young cavalry officer watched a shepherd taking care of his flock out in a green meadow. The shepherd's dogs managed the smaller sheep well, but they had great difficulty controlling the larger sheep. The Captain loved his dogs. He decided to breed a working dog that could manage the bigger sheep as well as the small ones. The dog must also be trusted not to injure any of the flock. Patiently using his knowledge of science and genetics, he eventually developed the German Shepherd. This special dog is intelligent, quick, protective of the sheep, dedicated to its master and very trustworthy. Like most dogs, the intentions and emotions of German Shepherds are transparent. They do not try to deceive others. They show their joy, anger or peacefulness with their eyes, ears and tail. Observant children usually know whether a dog is happy or angry. Pure German shepherds are trustworthy and friendly family members. They are as gentle with children in the family as they are with sheep in the pasture. They are reliable and fierce guardians, protecting children from hostile strangers. They are often chosen as guard dogs and guide dogs for the blind because they can be trusted to fulfill such important responsibilities. 8 During World War-I, German Shepherds became popular on the battlefield as troops told of their courage and reliability. Dedicated and dependable, the dogs demonstrated their uncanny sense of personal responsibility by locating wounded soldiers, carrying messages, helping to lay telephone lines, standing guard and going on scouting patrols. Even today, police officers report that German Shepherds are very useful on patrol duty. They praise these dogs for their reliability. Won't it be wonderful if human beings could also set aside their differences and come together with such unique qualities to help each other and at the same time remain loyal to one's community and country? Here are some organizations that are doing invaluable service to spread the message that caring for animals is a human responsibility, OUR RESPONSIBILITY . But, many ask...w hy should animals have rights? When it comes to pain, love, joy, loneliness and fear, whether man or animal, both feel the same. Animals are not ours to eat, wear, experiment on, use for entertainment or abuse in any other way. PETA -People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, is an American animal rights organization that has 3 million members and supporters and claims to be the largest animal rights group in the world. The organization first caught the public attention in the summer of 1981 about experiments conducted on 17 macaque monkeys in an animal laboratory. The case lasted 10 years and triggered an amendment in 1985 and established PETA as an internationally known organization. Today it focuses on 4 core issues - opposition to factory farming, fur farming, animal testing and animals in entertainment. It also campaigns against eating meat, fishing, killing of animals regarded as pests, keeping of chained backyard dogs, bull fighting, cock fighting, etc. They have worked with celebrities to bring into the public domain animal issues - everything from caged tigers, bullock drawn oil mills, rescuing animals abused in circuses, convincing fashion designers to shun fur and leather. Animal Rahat, a programme supported by PETA helps working animals by providing everything from much needed veterinary services, educating owners about basic care and offering a retirement plan that allows animals who are too old or sick to continue working, to live their last years in peace and comfort. People for Animals also known as PFA is claimed to be India's largest animal welfare organization with a nationwide network of 26 hospitals, 165 units and 2.5 Lakh members. The organization works to rescue and rehabilitate sick and needy animals. PFA has set up and runs shelters, ambulance services, sterilisation programmes, treatment camps and 9 Am I really the King of the Jungle? disaster rescue missions, for animals. They conduct education programmes in schools, fight cases in court and lobby on animal issues in parliament. At present, they have a nationwide network of 165 units, 26 hospitals and 60 mobile units. PFA aims to have an animal welfare center in each of the nation's 600 districts. Animal welfare is not just about animals. It is about us-o ur living conditions, our children, and our earth. Cruelty to animals has a significant and irreversible impact on human health, economy and environment.' A judicial decision that had far reaching effects: In the year 2000, the High Court in Kerala issued a landmark judgment related to \"Rights\" in relation to circus animals, ruling that they are \"beings entitled to dignified existence\" under Article -21 of the Indian Constitution. The ruling said that if human beings are entitled to these rights, animals should be too. The Court went beyond the requirements of the Constitution that all living beings should be shown compassion, and said : \"It is not only our fundamental duty to show compassion to our animal friends, but also to recognise and protect their rights. Other courts in India and one court in Sri Lanka followed the same practice. In 2012, Indian government's extensive ban on vivisection: The word vivisection is derived from the Latin word vivus meaning 'alive ' and 'section ' meaning cutting. It is a surgery conducted for experimental purposes on living organisms, including animals to view living internal structures. Animal welfare movements argued that animals and humans both have the same natural rights a s living creature and that it is inherently immoral to inflict pain or injury on another living creature, regardless of the purpose or potential benefit to humanity. Children and adults all over the world enjoy circuses and especially the animal tricks. But, reading this autobiography of the King of the Jungle your perceptions towards animal abuse in circuses for entertainment would change forever. I was born to be free, roam the jungles and live in my natural habitat. I had a place of pride in my kingdom because I was at the head of the food chain. I was respected, was proud and blessed to be free. But, things changed when one day mercilessly I was separated from my mother, dragged, captivated and chained in a circus. My heart wept a silent tear as you all clapped seeing my antics and also those of my friends. I have so much to tell you and share with you my deepest feelings ,with the fond hope that one day you will understand our plight and set us free. Our homes are not the green forests but tiny cramped cages barely larger than our own bodies where we are chained and tethered. We move from town to town loaded on to lorries and there is never a break from the endless travel. Many of the cages are rusty and live in 10 the filth of our own waste. There is no space to move around and we have bare access to food and water. My friend, the elephant is forced to spend the day shackled by three feet, the tiny birds often have their wings clipped which prevent them from flying, dogs are locked in cages. I can't exercise, play, roam or socialize. This stressful and unnatural environment causes physical and psychological trauma. I am naturally a semi nocturnal big cat and love the water but here in the circus I perform in the day time and denied any kind of watering hole. Basically we are solitary animals, but our circus handlers ignore this fact and make us live in incompatible groups resulting in fights and injuries. And then I wonder - am I really the King of the Jungle or am I just a mere entertainer? Do you think my big friend; the elephant likes to stand on all fours on a small football or the apes riding motorcycle. We do not choose to do our tricks; we are forced to perform through the use of fear, pain and hunger. In our natural surroundings we would never do such uncomfortable, repetitious painful acts. If you knew the cruel methods that we are subjected to, I am sure the animal antics in the circuses will quickly lose their appeal. Whips, muzzles, collars, bull hooks, electric roads and other tools are used during circus acts to remind us to perform in front of the audience. These 'performances' are because we are beaten, shocked and whipped into submission. Today, I am old, weak, tired and injured. I don't know what my fate is, will I die natural death or will I be killed when I will be of no use to my handlers. But, the King must look after his bretheren, I must speak for my other friends who suffer in silence as I did. 'The King' hum bly appeals to all of you to become aware of the cruelty involved in forcing animals to perform for entertainment. Take your family to see only animal free circuses, never forget that every circus ticket you buy funds cruelty to animals. Call your local radio or television stations and ask them to air messages about circus cruelty. Also, you can even write a letter to the editor of the local newspaper highlighting our plight. Organize a demonstration or a street play or distribute leaflets guiding people on what actions they can take when a circus comes to their town using these animals. I don't belong here. L et my spirit of freedom rekindle in all your hearts because - Circuses are no fun for animals. 11 Poaching Pangs... Animal poaching is when an animal is killed illegally because it possesses something that is considered valuable, that is fur, ivory, hide, claws, tusk, horns, etc. The world is dealing with an unprecedented spike in illegal wild life trade, threatening to overcome decades of conservation gains. Run by dangerous international networks, wildlife and animal parts are trafficked much like illegal drugs and arms, making wildlife crime a big business. It's very illegal nature makes it impossible to obtain reliable figures for the value of trade that occurs, amounting to more than hundreds of millions of dollars. Some examples of illegal wildlife trade are well known, such as poaching of elephants for ivory, tigers for their skins and bones, rhinoceros for its horn, gall bladders of bears for herbal medicines, big antlers of sheep, furs for clothing and carpets, snake and alligator skin for bags and shoes. Corruption, lacunae in laws, weak judicial system and light sentences allow these criminal syndicates to plunder wild life, with little regard to its consequences. In fact the poachers, who are often poor locals, are the ones usually caught, leaving the real master minds and their network saf e and operational with the ability to strike again, cause damage and death to a variety of animals, pushing them on the verge of extinction. When you know their nature, you know what's best for them. So, what can I do to help my animal friends..... I can become a zoo member and brave 'Zooperhero'. I can join an animal club. I can generate awareness. I can become a veterinarian and help the sick, injured and orphaned I can fight extinction. I can reduce threatening processes and save endangerment. I can work with others and improve animal care. I can be committed to the local spices and start a 'Love your Locals' cam paign. My creative sides can spread the message through street art, literary work. Finally, h aven't we all enjoyed listening to Panchtantra tales in our grandmother's lap ? These marvelous tales are educative, entertaining and impart strong moral values to the children. The characters in these classic stories are always animals and birds who in their own unique way teach us invaluable lessons of life - righteousness, false pride, the strength of unity, importance of friendship, camaraderie, presence of mind, faithfulness, greed that brings grief, selflessness and so much more. 12 So, let's enjoy one such virtue from a Panchtantra tale that teaches us that we should speak with care and not in haste. The Big Mouth Turtle Once, there was a turtle , who lived in a pond which was also visited by two young swans. The swans were friendly and compassionate and soon became friends with the turtle. They loved his simple nature. The swans were learned creatures and told the turtle fantastic things - the stories of sages and about the far of places they had flown to. The turtle would listen wide eyed and enraptured. The only bad habit he had was of interrupting the talk with his foolish remar ks. As time went by, their friendship grew. One year, it failed to rain, and there was a severe drought. The pond began drying up and water creatures perished. The tu rtle was in trouble. It was a question of life and death. The gentle swans were worried a bout the fate of their friend and kept assuring the turtle that everything would be alright and they flew far and wide looking for a safe place for their friend. One day, they said to the turtle, \"there is a lake fifty miles away which has a lot of food an d water in it, you will be safe there.\" The turtle sighed, \"Oh! Fifty miles? It will take me months to reach that place and I will die on the way.\" The swans thought of a plan to save their friend. They brought a small stick and said, \"friend turtle, we two will fly holding the ends of the stick in our beak. You shall hold the stick in your mouth at the centre. In this way we will fly you to that lake and there you will be fine. But, remember, not to open your mouth during the flight otherwise you will fa ll down.\" The turtle nodded and thus, the three got up in the air. The swans held the stick ends and the turtle hung by it. As they flew over a town the people below saw the unusual scene and pointed to one another. Everyone watched, leaned on their balcon ies, climbed to the roofs of their houses and made a lot of noise. Looking at the people down below, the turtle was excited and he forgot the warning of the swans and wanted to croak , \"Look! So many people are watching us.\" As soon as he opened his mouth h e fell down , hit the ground and died. Hence, we should only speak at the proper time. Never ignore or disrespect the advice of your loyal friends. Thus, all the anecdotes, poems, real life incidents and stories teach us the art of humane living and compassionate citizenship. We must develop the attitude of sympathetic awareness of others ' distress and try to alleviate it. Many a times, our activities bring sufferings to the world and we are not aware of it. We can change by our actions, by learning to make compassionate and responsible choices and thus becoming Compassionate Citizens. 13 Questions 1. You are an amateur animal rights activist.

To create awareness about road fatalities and how one can act in a responsible manner. To instill a sense of responsibility in the young minds. To create awareness on the importance of 'The Golden Hour'. 16 OPEN TEXT - BASED ASSESSMENT 2016 -17 English Class - IX Theme -2: Prepare & Prevent Don't Repair & Repent Don't be a by Stander; Stand by the Victims of Accidents Abstract What is a Hazard? -It refers to a dangerous situation or event that threatens or has the potential of causing injury to life or damage to property or the environment. They can be categorized in various ways but, based on the origin; hazards worldwide are ba sically grouped in two broad headings: 1 Natural Hazards (hazards with meteorological, geological or even biological origin) 2. Man made Hazards (hazards with human -caused or technological origin). Man made hazards are more serious as they are a result of human acts of omission and commission. Accidents are one of them. With advancement in technology and better connectivity, the world has shrunk; but at the same time the number of accidents is also on the rise. The main causes are the violation of traff ic regulations, speeding, drunk driving and poor maintenance of the vehicle and the roads. All these reasons add to the rising number of accidents and road fatalities. India has one of the highest accident rates in the world. Every year more than 300.000 a ccidents are reported. Fatality rate is as high as 60,000. Studies on accidents, the world over, have shown that the human factor is responsible for a majority of accidents. In India, vehicle users are the causative factor, in 70% of the road accidents. Pedestrians are responsible for 4.1% of the road accidents and poor condition of the roads accounts for about 0.4% of the accidents. It is evident, that nearly 80% of the accidents occur due to bad driving habits and human error. 17 Road safety is emerging as a major social concern in our country as the rate of road accidents is among the highest in the world. Here are some of the road accidents that turned fatal due to the callous attitude of the bystanders: (a) April 5, 2007, Kanpur: It was a big day for Shivam Bajpai as he had turned 16. As the chirpy lad was walking back from his school around 3.30 pm, a vehicle hit him and sped away. Seconds 18 later, as he lay on the road bleeding, another car ran over him. He crawled to the side of the road asking for help, but to no avail. People stopped to stare, but nobody came forward to help or call the police. Forty-five minutes later, Shivam died. (b) May 2, 2013, Amritsar: Karan Arora, a 24-year-old who was studying economics in the US, had come down to India for his summer vacation. Along with three friends, Karan set out on a road trip. On the outskirts of Amritsar, he spotted a crowd gathered on the highway, where a mangled car and a bleeding man were lying next to each other. When Karan and his friends decided to take the victim to the hospital, the crowd warned them against it. \"Don't do it, it's an accident case,\" one of them said. Karan soon found out why, as the emergency room refused to take the \"police case\" in. While Karan called the police, his friends persuaded the doctor to administer the victim first aid. Almost 20 minutes later, the doctor agreed. The police arrived another 15 minutes later and started to grill the youths. It went on for 90 minutes till the four called their parents to vouch for their identity. \"The victim survived, but the cops and the hospital staff made us feel as if we were criminals. I am not sure if I would ever want to do this again,\" Karan says. His story perhaps reflects the dilemma every common man faces while helping an accident victim: Dodge police harassment or save a life. Piyush Tewari chose the latter. Not just because he was Shivam's cousin, but because he wanted to build a social ethos that wouldn't make humane actions a liability. http://forbesindia.com/article/beyond-business/savelifes-wants-citizens- to-help-accident- victims/35733/0#ixzz460dLmgIN 19 The problem India records one of the highest number of road accidents in the world. In 2011, there was one accident every minute and one life lost every 3.7 minutes. Statistics released by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways in 2011 say there were 4,97,000 road accidents that left 1,45,485 people dead. Equally appalling is the chain of events after an accident. Every bystander wants to take a peek, but nobody wants to help even though at least 50 percent of the lives can be saved if the victim is administered basic care within the golden hour (60 minutes after an accident). That's about 70,000 lives saved every year. http://forbesindia.com/article/beyond-business/savelifes-wants-citizens- to-help-accident- victims/35733/0#ixzz460dLmgIN (c) A 26-year-old woman and her eight-month old daughter have died after being fatally hit by a truck and ignored by passing cars on the side of the road. The family of four was traveling on a two-wheeler through the Ghat Ki Guni tunnel in Jaipur, India. The woman's husband and their four-year-old son also sustained injuries following the accident. CCTV footage has now revealed that motorists continued to travel past the victims of the collision without stopping to help, despite the cries for assistance from the husband. Reports suggest the woman and child could have been saved if they had received medical help in time. The two-wheeler was hit by a speeding truck as it entered the tunnel. Two-wheelers are banned from using the tunnel, but many use them as a shortcut, according to Indian media. Mamta Sharma, chairperson of India's National Commission for Women (NCW) told NDTV: \"There was CCTV in the tunnel...People in the CCTV control room didn't inform the police. There was a delay of one and a half hours.\"If she was given medical attention on time she would have been saved.\"This claim was disputed by traffic officer Lata Manoj Kumar, who said the pair had died instantly. http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/woman-daughter-die-jaipur-tunnel-ignored-motorists- 457288 Here are some of the pages of the diary of Arjun Pratap, a 14 year old boy, studying in class-9 in one of the reputed schools of Delhi. Arjun belongs to an affluent family; his father being an exporter, a great business tycoon and mother an interior designer. Monday, 15 July 11:10 p.m. Dear Diary What a fabulous day it was! Finally mom and dad gifted me a bike that I had been asking for so long. None of my friends own it; not even my elder cousins. Lucky to have it in class 9! It's a heady feeling. I am going to ride it to school from tomorrow onwards. Hope it would leave an indelible impression on all my classmates!! Arjun ................................................................................................................................. 20 Wednesday, 17 July 10:25 p.m. Dear Diary I'm having the time of my life!! My new hairstyle goes perfectly well with my new bike. It looks fabulous without the helmet. Even my friends vouch for it. Mom initially refused but still took Aditya and Asif, my classmates on a ride today. Arjun ......................................................................................................... Friday, 11 November 11:05 p.m. Dear Diary Our world is shattered! It has come to a standstill. Aditya, my dear friend lost his leg in a road accident two weeks ago. It was my fault entirely. I had taken him for a ride along with Asif, to a nearby market, like any other day with no helmets. It was Asif's birthd ay. As the three of us neared the main road, I could see the Green light of the traffic signal. 7...6....5...the seconds were passing away; RED.....it was now. I raced up and jumped the signal; feeling like a superhero straight out of the Hollywood movie. A speeding bus came from the opposite side. My heart pounded...CRASH...!! The collision threw me on the footpath; Aditya was lying in a pool of blood, breathing heavily. I tried to get up, but couldn't. I shouted for help, requested and begged; but the curious onlooke rs did not lend a helping hand. I could see Aditya slipping away from us...he was sinking......and....Oh!!!...there he was.......lying unconscious!!! Asif was thrown on the other side of the road. His face smeared with blood. I could see passers-by clicking pictures and discussing about the accident; but none came forward. Everything started fading away; my vision getting blurred.....and then I lost consciousness. Had I stopped the bike at the signal, it would not have happened!! Had we worn helmets, our injuries would not have been that severe!! Or in the first place, had I not forced my parents to get me a bike (before 18) irrespective of their continuous refusal, all this would have been hypothetical!!! It hurts...it hurts badly! I have to carry this burden forever. I ca nnot face my parents. I feel like a culprit in front of Aditya's and Asif's parents. No amount of comforting words can take away their pain. All because of me!! Their sobs echo in my mind day in and day out. The proverbial albatross is hung around my neck forever. Wish I could go back in the past and erase all my mistakes! Arjun .......................................................................................................... 21 Friday, 11 November 11:25 p.m. Dear Diary Here is a tribute to Asif, as he celebrates his 16th birthday today. He still is in vegetative state at home. ONLY IF....!! Sweet Sixteen!! Yes, you are sixteen today. Of course, we would have dined at hotel FUN DAY, And invited all your cousins too. What a day it would have been for you, When all your wishes would come true. Only if that bystander could rush you to the hospital, That could have made the impact minimal, Only if that bystander could arrange for an ambulance, And would have tried saving you at first instance. Then we would have celebrated your birthday, Only if....Only if you weren't in that pathetic state today!! NOW I'VE VOWED TO WAGE A WAR, TO PROMOTE RESPONSIBLE ROAD BEHAVIOUR, AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF 'GOLDEN HOUR'!! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- - Later, Aditya lost his left leg to fatal injuries. The amputation could have been avoided if the onlookers had come forward in time to provide the crucial first aid. Arjun suffered from multiple fractures and internal bleeding. He was discharged in a month; while Asif bore the brunt of the accident. His skull was fractured and face disfigured. He laid in coma for 6 months, followed by multiple surgeries of the face. His mother went into depression and father had to borrow money to meet the never-ending medical expenses. Their only son was lying in a vegetative state. It was heart-wrenching tragedy for the three families. Completely avoidable! Arjun, now a student of class -10, is an active member of the Road Safety Club of his school. The club works with an NGO that spreads awareness about road safety measures in school, arranges visits to Traffic Training Parks, holds Talk Shows with traffic experts and presents street plays on related 22 issues. He is the most voiced member in propagating the latest Road Safety Bill, 2016; highlighting offences committed by Juveniles. According to Section 199, the Guardian / owner shall be deemed to be guilty in cases of offences by the Juveniles and Juvenile to be tried under JJ Act with Rs 25,000 with 3 yrs imprisonment. Registration of Motor Vehicle must be cancelled. (http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=148308) 23 Arjun is the most vocal member of the club, propagating the significance of the crucial Golden Hour that can save lives of hundreds of road accident victims. He makes sure to reiterate the fact that the first responders must act promptly and swiftly so as to not let the precious time slip by. Injury and trauma represent a major health problem all over the world. Almost 16,000 people die from various injuries every day in road fatalities. 90% of the global burden of road accidents take place in the developing and the under developed countries. It is saddening as well as alarming to note that such fatalities affect the productive youth of the country ; that leads to tremendous burden of disability from extremity, head, and spinal injuries. India stands out miserably in the latest World Health Organization's (WHO) \"Global Road Safety Report-2015\" with an estimated 207,551 deaths on roads. Studies show that 80 per cent of the road accident victims could be saved provided medical treatment is made available within one hour (golden hour) of the accident. However, due to lack of knowledge and awareness among citizens this important amendment has not come to the rescue of accident victims. There are other reasons why citizens hesitate to help accident victims. It is not because they do not want to, but due to the fear of being involved in other hassles. A survey revealed that if a supportive legal system is in place, a majority of 88 per cent would come forward and help injured trauma patients on the road. http://www.deccanherald.com/content/484923/protect-people-help-accident-victims.html Who is a trauma patient? A trauma patient is someone who has suffered a serious or life threatening injury as a result of an event such as a car accident, gunshot wound or fall. Traumatic injuries may affect many parts of the body, including the brain, the extremities and internal organs. So, what ails the Indian mindset? It is the basic reluctance to get involved in any kind of mishap that leads to unnecessary hassles. We must realize that during any such kind of mishap; every second counts, literally. It is a well-established fact that the patient's chances of survival are greatest if they receive care within a short period of time after any severe injury. That short time period of one hour is the most crucial one. It is t ermed as the 'golden hour'. According to the Merriam Webster Dictionary, GOLDEN HOUR is the hour immediately following traumatic injury in which medical treatment to prevent irreversible internal damage and optimize the chance of survival is most effective. In any road accident case, those sixty minutes or the golden hour can mean the difference between life and death. It is usually this first hour of definitive medical care where the patient's medical fate is sealed. The faster that medical care is rendered, the better the medical outcome will be. All this can have a profound impact on a patient's survival and ultimate ability to function. One must understand the gravity of such a situation and need to understand the importance of the Golden Hour. 24 It is the need of the hour to wake up to this problem and be a vigilant Indian, who knows of his rights and duties. Most of the times, it is the sheer lack of responsibility and knowledge about one's basic rights that forces a person to not come forward for help. There are good Samaritans everywhere. They just need to come forward and lend a helping hand to the needy. Let us see the brighter side of this whole scenario. The good Samaritans must share their empathetic attitude with others so that it kindles a feeling of sympathy in each one of us. One must not shy away from one's duty just because others don't come forward for the same. According to the Law Commission of India, 50% of those killed in road accidents could have been saved had timely assistance been rend ered to them. A World Health Organization report claims that \"skilled and empowered bystanders play a crucial role in saving lives\" and \"in order to enable bystanders to come forward and help injured persons, a supportive legal and ethical environment is n eeded.\" The Supreme Court, this year, approved the guidelines issued by the Centre for the protection of Good Samaritans at the hands of the police or any other authority. This is expected to significantly change the attitude of bystanders in assisting road accident victims - and thus should result in saving many more lives. A bench comprising justices V. Gopala Gowda and Arun Mishra directed the Centre to give wide publicity to the guidelines, which clearly stipulate that people who help victims of road accidents or other calamities are not harassed in any way. The guidelines lay down the following: 1. The Good Samaritan will be treated respectfully and without any discrimination on the grounds of gender, religion, nationality and caste. 2. Any individual, except an eyewitness, who calls the police to inform them of an accidental injury or death need not reveal his or her personal details such as full name, address or phone number. 3. The police will not compel the Good Samaritan to disclose his or her name, identity, address and other such details in the police record form or log register. 4. The police will not force any Good Samaritan in procuring information or anything else. 5. The police will allow the Good Samaritan to leave after having provided the informatio n available to him or her, and no further questions will be asked of him or her if he or she does not desire to be a witness. The guidelines also specify that the concerned Superintendent or Deputy Commissioner of Police are responsible in ensuring that all the above-mentioned procedures are implemented throughout their respective jurisdictions. http://thewire.in/2016/03/30/sc-guidelines- now -protect-good-samaritans-who-help-road- accident-victims-26680/ 25 Who is a Good Samaritan? A Good Samaritan is someone who is a compassionate person who unselfishly helps others, especially strangers. It is a Biblical term that refers to a figure in one of Christ's parables, who is an example of compassion towards those in distress. Current research suggests that humans may also have a biological urge, an impulse, to help each other. Most of the people come out to help out of impulsion. Well, there had been several good Samaritans who have helped save many lives of accident victims. Here is the news report about one of them. NAVI MUMBAI: A friend, who died for want of medical help in a highway accident nine years ago, inspired Pen resident Kalpesh Thakur (30) to help victims of road mishaps. Since then, Thakur, who is hotelier by profession, has helped many accident victims and also spends his own money to send bodies to far-off places like Karnataka. He has also helped in removing a large number of bodies from the accident spot. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/pen-samaritan-has-been-helping-accident- victims-since-9-years/articleshow/51846180.cms HOW CAN I BE A GOOD SAMARITAN? Many Indians, NGOs, and NRI doctors and surgeons have come forward to contribute in their own little way to create awareness regarding the importance of well-equipped first responders . Dr. Dinesh Vyas, MD, Asst. Professor, Deptt. Of Surgery, Michigan State University, U.S.A. has researched on trauma-related injury in fast-developing countries. According to him, properly trained medical first responders - offering the quickest care in both urban and rural settings-have demonstrated significant trauma outcome improvement in countries with poorly-developed emergency medical services. 26 Dr. Vyas is involved in a successful first responder training programme targeted towards these global outcomes, with India as a test case. He, along with his team of experts have specially designed a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) for training of first responders. They seek to build trauma management capacity in a manner that is globally scalable in the native languages of under-resourced nations , many of which now have Internet access. Thus, our MOOC design provides a no-cost, high-quality education, targeted for an expansive audience of laypersons. Always remember that instant and proper first aid given to road accident victims during golden hour increases the chance of survival manifold and reduce the severity of injuries. First aid is the initial care given to an injured person. This timely care prior to the arrival of the medical help means the difference between life and death as it is not always possible that proper medical care reaches the victim within an hour. In that case the passerby, onlookers and other people involved can provide the first aid to serious victims. However, improper handling to victims sometime worsens the situation. Though providing proper first aid to an accident victim is not so complicated but one should be aware of the procedures and precautions. One of the misconceptions about road accidents death is that most of them happen due to sever injury and` loss of blood. But in reality the most common cause of death in road accidents is due to loss of oxygen supply. Most of the times, it happens because airway gets blocked due to great impact and shock to body. Normally it takes less than four minutes for a blocked airway to cause death. Always cultivate the habit of caution as carefulness costs nothing while carelessness might cause you your life. 27 DON'T BE A BYSTANDER; STAND BY THE VICTIMS OF ACCIDENTS Q.1 Do you feel the concept of 'golden hour' is applicable to other disaster rescues as well?
