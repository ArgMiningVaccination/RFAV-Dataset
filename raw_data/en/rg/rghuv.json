Leigh D. Plant RESEARCH Developing Custom Treatment Strategies for Muscular Dystrophy Ailments Industry Healthcare ABOUT PROFESSOR Plant's LAB The Plant lab studies voltage-gated sodium channels (NaVs), the cellular machines that drive action potential generation in cardiovascular, muscular, and neural tissues. The activity of NaV channels is controlled by various protein partners and post-translational modifications that regulate the channel's behavior in response to hormones, neurotransmitters, and cell signaling pathways. Dysregulation of these signaling pathways, or mutations in the genes that encode for NaV channels can evoke devasting electrical disorders ranging from cardiac arrhythmias, pain, and epilepsy to muscular dystrophy and myotonia. Our lab uses a multidisciplinary approach to understanding these problems, creating new tools to dissect and control how cell signaling processes regulate NaV channels in health and disease. ABOUT THIS RESEARCH Muscular dystrophies (MD) are rare, genetic disorders of skeletal muscle that have a profound, detrimental effect on the quality of a patient's life and cause premature death. Several MDs are characterized by spells of muscle stiffness and pain that are often exacerbated by physical activity or cold. MDs are often associated with mutations in scn4a, the gene encoding the voltage-gated sodium channel protein, Nav1.4. There is no cure for MD, and the current FDA-approved treatments aim to manage disease symptoms by reducing severity and the activity of the patient. Apart from their prohibitive pricing, the drugs have undesirable side effects including balance disorders, vomiting, skin rash and joint pain. There is a clear and pressing unmet need for more effective drugs with substantially improved therapeutic efficacy. Meeting this need requires deeper insight into the regulation of Nav1.4 channels. Our lab discovered that the activity of Nav1.4 channels is critically dependent on the signaling phospholipid, PIP2. Here, we leverage state-of-the-art tools, such as patch-clamp and a strategy to control through light (optogenetics) to advance our understanding of mutation in scn4a associated with MD. Project Leadership Leigh D. Plant Ph.D. is assistant professor of Pharmaceutical Sciences and is also affiliated with The Center for Drug Discovery of Northeastern University. Dr. Plant is an expert in ion channel biophysics and pharmacology and his work was recently highlighted in the Journal of General Physiology. Dr. Plant is from the UK, and started his training working with venomous snakes that yield toxins that have unlocked our understanding of ion channels. Kirin Gada, M.B.B.S./Ph.D. is a postdoctoral fellow in the Plant Lab and has worked on the relationship between ion channels and PIP2 with potassium channels in her PhD and NaV channels in her postdoctoral career. Rebecca Carrier RESEARCH Streamlining Oral Drug Formulation Using Model-driven Design of Lipid-based Vehicles Industry Chemical Engineering ABOUT THE CARRIER LAB The Advanced Drug Delivery Research (ADDRes) Lab applies engineering principles to develop relevant models of health and disease and enable effective delivery of therapeutics. We focus largely on advancing intestinal and retinal tissue engineering and drug delivery. Major research thrusts include developing: 1. theoretical and experimental frameworks to predict the impact of dietary lipids on the absorption and bio-availability of oral drugs, 2. In vitro models for studying the human microbiome-gut-immune axis and transport at the intestinal mucosal barrier, and 3. biomaterials to support development of retinal organoids as well as the delivery, survival, and integration of implanted cells ( [https://carrier.sites.northeastern.edu](https://carrier.sites.northeastern.edu/)). ABOUT THIS RESEARCH It is estimated that over 90% of compounds emerging from pharmaceutical and biotechnology discovery pipelines have low oral bioavailability. Despite the poor bioavailability, oral delivery is heavily preferred over other routes of administration. Lipids can have a tremendous impact on oral drug absorption, enhancing bioavailability by several hundred percent. Despite decades of research, relatively few commercial oral formulations incorporate lipid-based delivery systems. This is due in large part to resource-intensive trial and error testing in the design of lipid-based formulations. We have developed a mechanism-based algorithm that can reduce the need for trial-and-error formulation development with lipids by providing rational guidance on the most optimal quantities and types of lipids to achieve desired drug absorption kinetics. In this project, we are making critical extensions to our algorithm to also capture the impact of common added components of lipid-based formulations including surfactants that have a partially lipophilic and partially hydrophilic nature. Project Leadership The key researchers on this project are Prof. Rebecca Carrier and Dr. Oljora Rezhdo. Prof. Rebecca Carrier is a faculty member in Chemical Engineering with affiliations in Biology and Bioengineering. Dr. Oljora Rezhdo is a research scientist with a PhD in Chemical Engineering and expertise in drug delivery, lipid function in the gastrointestinal tract, and modeling of the gastrointestinal tract. Yi Zheng RESEARCH Nanofibrous bio-paint for large-scale passive cooling Industry Mechanical and Industrial Engineering About Prof. Zheng's Lab Prof. Zheng leads the Nano Energy Laboratory which emphasizes the theoretical, analytical, and experimental investigations on energy transport phenomena and opto-thermal sensing. The lab aims to enhance physical, particularly thermal and optical, properties of functional materials and explore their applications in energy conversion, storage, and harvesting systems, thermophotovoltaics, sensing, thermal diodes and transistors, and passive cooling technique. About This Project As of 2022, compressor-based cooling systems, providing comfortable interior environments for infrastructure (e.g., buildings), account for about 20% of total worldwide electricity consumption. The resultant greenhouse gas emissions expelled to the environment intensify global warming and accelerate climate change. Here, we are proposing an energy-efficient, eco-friendly cooling approach that is vital to curbing greenhouse gas emissions. Emerging passive cooling technologies have the potential to solve this problem. Such an approach, with strong market potential in both highly developed and developing regions, is becoming an attractive candidate for improving the energy efficiency of buildings by reducing the need for the coolants, electricity, and compressors required by traditional mechanical cooling systems. Project Leadership Prof. Yi Zheng is the PI of this Spark Fund project. He is an Associate Professor at the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Affiliated Faculty at the Department of Chemical Engineering, and the Director of Nano Energy Laboratory at Northeastern University. He also founded the clean-tech startup company Planck Energies to commercialize the energy-saving materials for infrastructure. He received his Ph.D. and M.S. from Columbia University and B.S. from the Tsinghua University, all in Mechanical Engineering. Prof. Zheng has secured external funding from diverse sources including multiple federal agencies NSF, NIH, NASA, DARPA, ONR, US Air Force, as well as industrial funding from 3M, MassVentures, and Soleeva Energy. Andrew Caratenuto is the Co-PI of this project. He is currently a senior Ph.D. candidate under Prof. Zheng's supervision and the CEO of Planck Energies Eno Ebong RESEARCH Structurally and Functionally Repaired Endothelium Glycocalyx Industry Bioengineering and Chemical Engineering About the Ebong Mechanobiology Lab The Ebong Mechanobiology Lab studies how blood flow affects endothelial cells lining blood vessels, focusing on the glycocalyx. The glycocalyx, a gel-like structure of sugars and proteins, converts mechanical forces into biological responses to protect against disease. Shedding of the glycocalyx promotes pathological remodeling, leading to atherosclerosis and tumor formation. The lab replicates healthy and disruptive conditions using in vitro systems and live animal studies to understand the flow-glycocalyx-endothelial cell relationship. Their goal is to develop therapies to reverse disease progression. ABOUT THIS RESEARCH Atherosclerosis is the underlying cause of the majority of heart attacks, strokes, aneurysms, peripheral vascular disorders, and other cardiovascular conditions that affect millions of adults worldwide. The economic burden is $363 billion for health care and lost productivity in America alone. Current therapeutic approaches primarily target advanced stages of the disease. The goal of this research, supported by the Spark Fund, is to develop a new therapeutic approach that will be capable of intervening in early disease stages, by regenerating the vasculoprotective endothelial cell surface glycocalyx that is mechanically sensitive and damaged at the onset of atherosclerosis. Project Leadership Dr. Ebong E. Ebong, who leads the project team, holds joint appointments in Chemical Engineering and Bioengineering, with Biology affiliation. An expert on cardiovascular cell and molecular mechanobiology, endothelium glycocalyx, and vascular remodeling, Dr. Ebong is supported PhD students Ronodeep Mitra (Chemical Engineering) and Kaleigh Pentland (Bioengineering). There are several additional team members who, together with Dr. Ebong, Mr. Mitra, and Ms. Pentland, create a multidisciplinary research team with expertise in chemical engineering, bioengineering, chemistry, mechanobiology, imaging, pharmacology, and medicine. This team is uniquely suited to advance this Spark Fund project.

Dori Woods RESEARCH Compartmentalizing Biology to Diagnose and Treat Disease Industry Life Sciences About the Woods lab The Woods Laboratory is interested in studying the role of mitochondria in normal and disease states, with a major emphasis on how mitochondria are specifically tailored to a cell's functional or dysfunctional requirements. We aim to leverage our expertise and cutting-edge methods to fully harness the therapeutic potential of mitochondrial subtypes, as well as deeply explore the causal link of mitochondrial function in the maintenance of critical cell fate processes. Most recently, we developed and validated a computational pipeline (patent pending) to thoroughly assess cellular component (e.g., mitochondria) constructs in great detail, and have spun it out into a start-up, Calafate Biologics. About this research With its disruptive Compartmentalized Cell Biology (CCB) approach, Calafate Biologics is uncovering previously hidden target genes from widely available multi-omics datasets in a variety of biological processes ranging from cancer chemoresistance to neurodegeneration. By anchoring data exploration to a biologically relevant component (organelle of interest), our contemporary integrated pipeline outputs immediately clear and actionable leads ushering in a new era of next-generation diagnostic and therapeutic products. Project Leadership Calafate co-founders Prof. Dori Woods, Ph.D., and Prof. Jonathan Tilly, Ph.D. bring over 25 years of experience in discovering novel mitochondrial mechanisms and properties with a high-impact on cell fate mapping and death. Recent graduate and co-founder, Fausto Capelluto, Ph.D. is spearheading the development of the CCB-pipeline technology and its various applications. Zhaohui Sunny Zhou RESEARCH Spatial and Temporal Activation of Protein Therapeutics by Light: Animal Testing for Photo-Caged Immunotoxin to Treat Eye Cancer Industry Biopharmaceutical ABOUT PROFFESOR ZHOU'S LAB Our invention and platform enable the spatial and temporal activation of peptide and protein drugs by light and other stimuli for more efficacious and less toxic therapeutics. Furthermore, our technologies open exciting new opportunities for novel drug targets that otherwise not suited for traditional approaches. ABOUT THIS RESEARCH A fundamental impediment in drug development is the limited therapeutic index, due to the on-target/off-tumor toxicity. Our approach is to mask (or cage) peptides and proteins, rendering them inactive. Our invention and platform enable both the chemo-enzymatic site-specific conjugation and the engineered chemistry tailored for the controlled re-activation (unmasking or uncaging). For clinical applications, after administering to the patients, then upon exposure to light (or other stimuli), the mask is removed, the active form is regenerated with precise spatial and temporal controls, thereby expanding therapeutic index. Project Leadership Professor Sunny Zhou's laboratory, aka SunnyLand, applies protein chemistry, analysis and engineering to biology and medicine. Their \"Hybrid Modality Engineering of Proteins\" platform introduces non-canonical chemical moieties and/or scaffolds into peptides and proteins to confer novel functions (mode of action) otherwise unavailable via recombinant technology. Dr. Amissi Sadiki (Sunny's former student), Professor Bryan Spring (expert in photomedicine) and Sunny are co-founders of NIRa Biosciences, which focuses on photo-immunotherapy and has received Series A VC funding. Diomedes Logothetis RESEARCH Developing selective modulators of brain GIRK1/2 for treatment of epilepsy Industry Health Care ABOUT PROFESSOR LOGOTHETIS'S LAB The Logothetis lab focuses on the molecular details of how the signaling membrane phospholipid, PIP2, controls gating of ion channels, such as the G-protein gated inwardly rectifying K+ channels (GIRKs). GIRK activation inhibits excitability and is involved in conditions, such as epilepsy, pain/opioid addiction and cardiac arrhythmias, like atrial fibrillation. Small molecule drugs can activate GIRKs allosterically. Computer simulations of GIRKs with PIP2 and small molecule activators have captured the details of channel gating, offering a platform for dynamic structure-based drug design. ABOUT THIS RESEARCH Dravet Syndrome (DS) is a rare pediatric epilepsy starting as early as 6 months of age, characterized with severe prolonged, recurrent seizures, and considerable risk of sudden unexplained death from epilepsy (SUDEP). No cure for DS is known, and current FDA-approved treatments are ineffective and poorly tolerated by the patients. In a properly functioning brain, firing of inhibitory and excitatory neurons maintains a balance in electrical activity. However in DS, silencing mutations in sodium channels, found mainly in inhibitory interneurons, cause an imbalance and hyperexcitability leading to seizures. Our drug candidates can reduce hyperexcitability and restore balance by selectively acting on the GIRKs found in the regions of the brain associated with seizure generation. Our approach to drug discovery mitigates the risk of off-target effects and toxicities (i.e. cardiac toxicity), as shown by our lead drug candidate. PROJECT LEADERSHIP Diomedes E. Logothetis, Ph.D. is a professor of Pharmaceutical Sciences, leading research efforts in the field on the molecular basis of function and malfunction of ion channels. Currently, he is affiliated with The Center for Drug Discovery and the Roux Institute of Northeastern University.

Yaning Li RESEARCH Testing 3D tiled auxetic metamaterial (3D TAMM) for impact-resistance Applications Industry Advanced Materials ABOUT PROFESSOR LI'S LAB The Mechanics, Biomimetics, and 3D/4D Printing Research Lab focuses on exploring the mechanics and innovative design of new engineering materials including mechanical metamaterials, bio-inspired composites, and smart and adaptive architected materials. We aim to leverage mechanics, materials, biomimetics, and advanced additive manufacturing to not only design and fabricate the new generation of materials with unusual mechanical properties, but also revolutionize the material design and manufacturing framework. ABOUT THIS RESEARCH We will design and fabricate new three-dimensional tiled auxetic metamaterial (3D TAM), targeting applications in battery enclosure designs and packaging. 3D TAM are composed of tiled elements with relative locomotion to each other to achieve programmable auxeticity and superior impact resistance and energy dissipation capability. Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Finite Element (FE) simulations will be used to design and systematically quantify the mechanical properties of 3D TAM. Selected designs will be fabricated via a multi-material 3D printer. Mechanical experiments will be performed on the 3D printed prototypes to evaluate their mechanical performance under both static and dynamic loads. PROJECT LEADERSHIP Yaning Li, Ph.D., is an Associate Professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering. She leads the Mechanics, Biomimetics and 3D/4D printing research lab. She will bring her expertise in mechanics and design of mechanical metamaterials, finite element simulations, bio-inspired engineering and additive manufacturing to this project. Dr. Tiantian Li and Richard Nash (Ph.D candidate), who are two core members of the project, will lead the project. Graduate students Yunzheng Yang, Shengbin Zhang, Lin Gu, Siyao Liu, Ammar Batwa from the group, and Dr. Anastassios Mavrokefalos from Rogers will peripherally support the project. Ryan Koppes RESEARCH Building a stem cell strategy for improving peripheral nerve repair Industry Health Care ABOUT PROFESSOR KOPPES' LAB The laboratory for Neuromodulation and Neuromuscular repair (LNNR) is working on developing a fundamental understanding of how the nervous system's structure informs function and developing new 3D in vitro platforms to provide new insight. The lab is focused on developing new strategies including stem cell sourcing, biomaterials, and stimulation modalities for nerve repair, as well as innovations in the organ-on-a-chip through the inclusion of high-throughput design, instrumentation, and the inclusion of the autonomic nervous system. ABOUT THIS RESEARCH Over 3.5 million peripheral nerve injury cases are reported throughout the world each year. Injuries to the peripheral nervous system are often caused by trauma to the extremities. Main causes include car accidents, gunshot injuries, and stretching/crush injuries with a high (83%) prevalence in people under the age of 55, especially military personnel. With the increase in trauma incidents as well as the increase in medical capabilities (patients can survive more extensive injuries), it is expected that the number of injuries occurring per year will increase. Schwann cells are paramount in promoting and guiding regenerating neurons after injury. However, severely injured tissue lacks sufficient Schwann cells to facilitate the repair process. Our research focuses on differentiating Olfactory Mucosa-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells towards a Schwann cell to offer an alternative source for surgical intervention. The success of this project will shift the way surgeons handle traumatic injury, allowing more synthetic material to be utilized in the repair of injury, saving the very limited donor tissue for critical needs. PROJECT LEADERSHIP Dr. Ryan Koppes has been an Assistant Professor at Northeastern University since 2015, where he has founded the Laboratory for Neuromodulation and Neuromuscular Repair (LNNR). Ryan received his Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, New York in 2013. Dr. Koppes has been working on new solutions for peripheral nerve repair for over ten years now. He is also working on the development of innervated, human organs-on-a-chip. Dr. Koppes also enjoys teaching Chemical Engineering Experimental Design Lab II (Unit Operations II) for senior engineers, as well as mentoring undergraduates in the laboratory. Dr. Abigail Koppes joined the department of Chemical Engineering at Northeastern University in 2014 where her group, the Advanced Biomaterials for Neuroengineering Laboratory (ABNEL), harnesses biochemical engineering methods to address challenges in nervous system disorders and dysfunction. Katelyn Neuman is an ABD PhD student in Chemical Engineering at Northeastern. She has spearheaded this research thrust and has been responsible for stem cell isolation, differentiation protocol development, and characterization. Ke Zhang RESEARCH Completing a proof-of-concept study of a Duchenne muscular dystrophy candidate Industry Health Care ABOUT PROFESSOR ZHANG'S LAB Prof. Zhang's laboratory is transforming the field of gene regulation therapeutics with a proprietary oligonucleotide enhancer technology termed the Brushield. The Brushield platform can rapidly generate potent clinical leads with reduced side effects and enhanced delivery to non-liver sites. In some preclinical models, Brushield reduces the dosage requirement by two orders of magnitude while suppressing side effects and immunogenicity. This technology is being licensed by an NU spinout called pacDNA Inc., which is now beginning commercial operations in LabCentral 700, Cambridge, MA. ABOUT THIS RESEARCH Where traditional drugs work by interfering with the function of a protein, gene regulation technologies attack disease at the source by inhibiting or correcting the production of the problematic protein from its genetic instructions. However, multiple challenges remain, such as rapid renal clearance, inefficient delivery to non-liver organs, and immunogenicity/toxicity, which reduce the scope of gene regulation drug development to a few concentrated disease settings. pacDNA Inc. aims to change the status quo by developing a safe and efficient oligonucleotide delivery technology that addresses non-liver organs, reduces cost, and minimizes off-target effects. PROJECT LEADERSHIP With formal training in polymers, Prof. Zhang, PhD is devoting his career to facilitating the marriage of synthetic polymers and nucleic acids. His prized inventions include several forms of DNA-polymer amphiphiles, conjugates, and nanoparticles, which are being geared towards materials science and disease treatment.

Carolyn Lee-Parsons RESEARCH Engineering plants to produce increased anti-cancer drug precursors Industry Health Care ABOUT THE LEE-PARSONS LAB Plants produce a wide array of valuable, biologically active natural products that we use as medicines (i.e. anti-cancer, anti-viral, anti-infectives, antimicrobials). While plants are amazing chemists, these compounds are produced in limited concentrations. The overall vision of the research in the Lee-Parsons Lab is to understand how plants regulate the production of these critical plant-derived pharmaceuticals towards the goal of engineering their enhanced production and meeting the need for these important medicines ( [https://lee-parsons.sites.northeastern.edu/](https://lee-parsons.sites.northeastern.edu/)). ABOUT THIS RESEARCH The plant-derived pharmaceuticals of interest are the terpenoid indole alkaloids (TIAs) from cultures of the Catharanthus The C. roseus plant produces several highly-valued TIAs, including the anti-cancer drugs vinblastine and vincristine. The high cost ($4 - 60 million/kg) and need for these anti-cancer compounds motivate our research to better understand their biosynthesis and ultimately overproduce these valuable TIAs economically and reproducibly using engineered C. roseus plants or cultures as the production platform. In this project, we are investigating regulators that turn on and turn off the production of limiting precursors to the anti-cancer compounds towards engineering a high-yielding plant. PROJECT LEADERSHIP The key researchers on this project are Prof. Carolyn Lee-Parsons and Dr. Lauren Cole. Prof. Carolyn Lee-Parsons is a faculty member jointly appointed in Chemical Engineering and Chemistry & Chemical Biology, with affiliations in Biology and Bioengineering. Dr. Lauren Cole is a post-doctoral researcher with her PhD in Bioengineering and expertise in plant biotechnology and plant specialized metabolism. Emily Zimmerman RESEARCH NeuroSense Diagnostics Industry Life Sciences ABOUT PROFFESOR ZIMMERMAN'S LAB NeuroSense Diagnostics - the only non-contact infant suck monitoring system that will enable families to thrive. Our smartphone app will offer infant suck monitoring to a vast potential customer base\u2014in a package far more affordable and convenient than existing options\u2014by leveraging cutting edge, in-house computer vision technology developed by our uniquely qualified team. ABOUT THIS RESEARCH Infant feeding is complex and consists of sucking, swallowing, and breathing and all must be coordinated for feeding to occur successfully. Currently, assessment of infant feeding is extremely subjective and includes assessing all these components together at the same time by observing a bottle feed or by simply placing a gloved finger in the infant's mouth to feel the strength of their suck. This trial-and-error approach can have devastating outcomes for the developing infant and can lead to feeding aversions and prolonged hospitalizations. Objectively measuring and longitudinally monitoring the patterns of non-nutritive suck (NNS)\u2014sucking without nutrient being delivered\u2014guides therapy and improves safety by lowering the risk of feeding aversion and the danger of milk aspiration into the lungs. Currently, no technology currently exists to track infant NNS remotely. Put simply, if we had more quantitative and accurate data, we could do more targeted feeding therapies earlier and we could blunt developmental delays. PROJECT LEADERSHIP Professor Zimmerman directs the Speech and Neurodevelopment Lab SNL, which examines the environment, psychosocial, physiological, and genetic factors surrounding sucking and feeding development. She has approximately 8 years of experience in the NICU as a feeding researcher. Professor Ostadabbas is a co-founder of NeuroSense Diagnostics and directs the Augmented Cognition Laboratory (ACLab). She will bring her expertise in infant facial landmark tracking to this innovation with assistance from Dr. Wan, a Senior Computational Scientist at the Roux Institute. Mansoor Amiji RESEARCH Oral RNA Tx -Solutions for Oral RNA Delivery Industry Life Sciences ABOUT PROFESSOR AMIJI'S LAB The Laboratory for Biomaterials and Advanced Nano-Delivery Systems (BANDS) focuses on research at the interface of medicine and material science to solve important biomedical problems.

Professor Amiji has over 30 years of experience in pharmaceutical formulation development and his lab at Northeastern University has made significant advances in the development of target specific drug and gene delivery systems. Sara M. Hashmi RESEARCH High throughput microfluidic tensiometry/elastometry Industry Microfluidics ABOUT PROFESSOR HASHMI'S LAB The Hashmi Complex Fluids Lab studies the flow of soft materials through small spaces. We are interested in how phenomena like droplet deformation, particle softness and polymer gelation affect the ability of fluids to travel through pore spaces, thus improving our understanding of flows in disparate contexts from biomedicine to industry and the environment. In biomedical contexts, the impact of material softness on flow has implications for and also can indicate a variety of disease states from pre-diabetes to metastatic cancer. ABOUT THIS RESEARCH While we mainly investigate how material softness determines complex fluid flow, in this project we turn this idea on its head: we measure flow to quantify both droplet surface tension and particle softness. Our in-situ, in-line technology will help increase stability and high-throughput efficiency in a variety of microfluidic platforms that use droplet and particle encapsulation for drug discovery, pharmaceutical development, and other applications. We will work with advisors from the microfluidics industry to ensure maximum impact of our innovation. PROJECT LEADERSHIP Sara M. Hashmi, Ph.D., is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering, with affiliations with the Departments of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering and Chemistry and Chemical Biology. She brings her expertise in microfluidics, optical microscopy, materials characterization and theoretical modeling to this project. Two fourth year graduate students in the Hashmi Complex Fluids Lab, Barrett Smith and Sabrina Marnoto, will contribute to various aspects of this project from designing control materials to validating and extending the technology to broader contexts. Peter Bex RESEARCH Validating AI-guided, rapid, self-administered vision diagnostics in a remote setting Industry Life Sciences ABOUT PROFFESOR BEX'S LAB The Translational Vision Science Lab's focus is to study the developmental and aging human visual system both to enhance the fundamental understanding of human visual perception and cognition and also to improve diagnostic and treatment regimes for visual disorders in clinical populations. These clinical applications have the potential to be useful beyond specific research applications and thus our lab aims to translate the insights gained during the research into useful and impactful patents and products. ABOUT THIS RESEARCH Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of visual impairment worldwide as it causes blind spots that progressively diminishes the central visual field that is used to see details of the world such as reading this text and recognising faces. Current treatments for AMD aim to slow or stop the progression of the disease as there is currently no cure. Therefore, early detection of the disease and monitoring its progression during treatment are critical. Clinical diagnostics suffer a number of problems: A patient needs to attend a clinic, needs to see a trained clinician who can administer tests that are cumbersome, time-consuming, and unable to detect subtle, small changes of vision due to disease progression or treatment intervention. The current project will use computer-based, rapid, self-administered vision diagnostics that probe multiple visual functions before and during AMD treatment, and will conduct those tests remotely. PROJECT LEADERSHIP Prof. Bex, Ph.D., is the head of the translational vision science lab. His research investigates the developmental and aging human visual system using quantitative approaches. Prof. Bex has worked on the diagnosis and rehabilitation of AMD and developed together with Dr. Skerswetat the methods deployed during this project. He will be advisor for data analysis and scientific communication. Dr. Skerswetat is a trained optometrist by background (M.Sc.) and has working experience with AMD patients both clinically as well as during research projects conducted in Prof. Bex's lab. He is also a trained researcher with a Ph.D. in vision science and developed together with Prof. Bex a novel vision diagnostics platform since he started his postdoctoral research in the fall of 2019. He will take the lead of the research project.

JEFFREY RUBERTI RESEARCH CRISPR Cas-9 Production of Human Collagen Industry Life Sciences ABOUT PROFESSOR RUBERTI's LAB The Extracellular Matrix Engineering Research Laboratory (EMERL) examines the formation of collagenous matrices based on mechanochemistry. Our fundamental hypothesis is that collagen is an active energetic molecule whose energy state is lowered when subjected to mechanical tensile force and that this behavior or an analog of it is responsible for the construction of animals across the all Phyla. Ultimately, the work done at EMERL is aimed at translation to clinical mechanotherapies. ABOUT THIS RESEARCH There are currently few reliable sources of human active collagen. To construct therapeutics that deliver active collagen to injuries, the EMERL lab has been working to enhance the production of this very important molecule using the CRISPR Cas-9 promotional system. Thus the work will be focused on developing and optimizing methods to induce human fibroblasts to produce large amounts of type I collagen. In addition, the packaging of collagen into a metastable liquid crystal for in vivo delivery of active collagen is also part of this effort.
