Weekly group sessions of 2.5 hours, with 45 minutes/day of practice. | Behavioral: Meditation | Eight weeks of training in mindfulless meditation. Weekly group sessions of 2.5 hours, with 45 minutes/day of practice. | Experimental: Exercise | Eight weeks of training in moderately strenuous exercise. Weekly group sessions of 2.5 hours, with 45 minutes/day of practice. | Behavioral: Exercise | Eight weeks of training in moderately strenuous exercise.

Incidence (number) of cold flu episodes and total unadjusted days of illness will also be reported. [ Time Frame: 2009-2010 cold season ] - Immune response to influenza immunization (flu shot): serum IgG, mucosal IgA, cultured ex vivo lymphocytes. Flu shots are given in 6th week of 8 week intervention sessions. [ Time Frame: 3 weeks after flu shot ] - Severity of illness assessed by biomarkers from nasal wash (IL-8, neurophil count) [ Time Frame: every cold or flu illness illness episode ] - Nucleic acid based viral identification will identify pathogen and verify all symptomatic infections [ Time Frame: every cold or flu illness episode ] Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.

Prospective participants must meet the American Heart Association guidelines225 for suitability for an exercise program. Prospective participants will be advised (but not required) to seek their physicians' advice before enrollment. 2) Current or recent use of meditative practice, or previous meditation training. Assessed by answering \"Yes\" to any of the following questions: Do you meditate on a regular basis? In the last year, have you meditated at least weekly for 2 or more months in a row? Have you ever been trained in meditation? Have you ever been involved in a mindfulness class or mindfulness practice? 3) Potential participants must not engage in moderate exercise more than twice per week or vigorous exercise more than once per week, as assessed by the following questions adapted from the BRFSS classification226 system: On average, how many times per week do you engage in moderate recreational activities such as walking, tennis doubles, ballroom dancing, weight training, or similar activities that last at least 20 minutes per occasion? A) Less than 1 time per week; B) 1 time per week; C) 2 times per week; D) 3 times per week; E) >4 times per week. How many times per week do you engage in vigorous sport and recreational activities such as jogging, swimming, cycling, singles tennis, aerobic dance or other similar activities lasting at least 20 minutes per occasion? A) Less than 1 time per week; B) 1 time per week; C) 2 times per week; D) 3 or more times per week. 4) Immune deficiency or auto-immune disease (eg. HIV/AIDS, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease; Co-Investigator Dr. Muller will advise in questionable cases). 5) Current use or forecasted need for immunoactive drugs (eg. steroids, immunosuppressants, chemotherapy); nonsteroidal antiinflammatories will be allowed. 6) Current use or forecasted need for antibiotic or antiviral medications (eg. prophylactic or suppressive therapy for chronic urinary tract infection, recurrent herpes, or other chronic infections. 7) Malignant disease (prospective participants' physicians to advise. Dr. Barrett to make final decision in questionable cases). 8) Function-impairing psychopathology (prospective participants' psychiatrist or psychologist to advise). 9) Influenza vaccination (flu shots) within 6 months prior to enrollment. 10) True egg allergy or true allergic reaction to prior flu shot, either of which would have to include at least one of the following: a) large rash or swelling (more than 12 inches in diameter), b) any swelling in throat, c) any difficulty breathing, d) reaction with hospitalization, or e) anaphylaxis. Reactions that would NOT exclude people: a) local pain or swelling, b) fever, c) malaise, feeling lousy, or d) cold, flu or other infectious illness.
