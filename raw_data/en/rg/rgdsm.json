Introduction Ageing is a major independent risk factor for cardiovascular -related morbidity and mortality. The ageing heart exhibit s different biological features and processes compared with young hearts, which include i ncreased apoptosis, sustained low grade inflammat ion, hemodynamic changes and cardiomyocyte senescence (1). Most ageing-dependent changes result in the accumulation of collagen , leading to cardiac fibrosis and subsequent progression to heart failure. In this review, we will summarise current knowledge about the contribut ing factors for ageing-related cardiac fibrosis and t he potential mechanisms responsible for fibrosis development in the ageing heart. Fully understand ing these factors and mechanisms of ageing may provide insight into potential novel anti -fibrotic therapeutics for ageing related cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure within the ageing population. 2. The process of cardiac fibrosis Cardiac fibrosis due to excessive deposition of extracellular matrix(ECM), including collagen and fibronectin , results in excessive accumulation of fibrous connective tissue. The ECM is Author ManuscriptThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved normally regulated by resident fibroblasts which modulate the balance between synthesis and degradation of collagen and provid es structural support and tissue repair for the heart. However, excessive of ECM deposition leads to pathological changes that include chamber dilation and hypertrophy, eventually leading to failure(2). There are two main causes for overexpression of collagen : fibrogenic growth factors and increase of cellular population . ECM deposition is regulated by proteases and their inhibitors , such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). MMPs are members of proteases family, which play an important role in collagen degradation. In contrast , TIMPs acts as an inhibitor of MMPs by decreasing collagen degradation (3). The levels of MMPs and TIMPs are balanced by several cytokines - macrophage (GM -CSF) and transforming growth factor (TGF ), (4, 5). These factors induce fibroblast proliferation , indicating their fibrogenic activity (6). Fibroblasts proliferation and transformation are another key cellular event s in the fibrotic process. In the fibrotic heart, Increased myofibroblasts are derived from proliferation and transformation of the local resident populations of fibroblasts and trans-differentiation of intrinsic cells. This is enhanced in the process of tissue repair when there is a pressure overload or myocardial infarction (7 , 8). Other known cell type trans-differentiations include epithelial cells undergoing epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and endothe lial cells undergoing endothelial to mesenchymal trans -differentiation (EndMT) (9, 10). The cell trans - differentiation process is characteri sed by expressi on of the contractile protein -smooth muscle actin (SMA) . Cell transformation and the fibrogenic factors also interact with each other, as intrinsic cells trans-differentiation is followed by increasing levels of fibrogenic factors (such as TGF -1 and ED -A fibronectin) (11). Pericytes may also be an additional source of myofibroblasts in the fibrotic heart. However, their role in fibrotic remodelling of the ventricle is still unknown (9). Proliferating myofibroblasts are also co mmonly found in many damaged hearts (12). Therefore, targeting fibrogenic growth factors and cellular transdifferentiation may be of therapeutic benefit for cardiac fibrosis. 3. Contributors of cardiac fibrosis in ageing Author ManuscriptThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved In contrast to conventional cardiac fibrosis which is accompanied by inappropriate proliferation of cardiac cells and excessive deposition of ECM, aging-related cardiac fibrosis is characterized by degenerative changes, such as progressive loss of myocytes due to necrotic and apoptotic cell death with increase in myocardial collagen content (13). This means the absolute number of myocytes decreases in aging hearts, and the remaining cardiomyocytes undergo hypertrophy and myocardium fibrosis. MMP-3, MMP -14 decreases significantly. MMPs primarily serve as collagenases, playing an important role in the degradation of aggrecan ( by and -fibrotic MMPS inhibitors, TIMP-1 and TIMP -4, in the human heart leading to unbalance of ECM turnover and cardi ac fibrosis (15). The key contributing factors related to cardiac ageing and the roles they play are summarised in Figure 1. 3.1. Inflammation The relationship between inflammation and cardiac fibrosis is well established. Inflammatory cells release fibrogenic cytokines and growth factors stimulating the reparative process. A series of cytokines (IL -1, TNF, and IL -18) promote DNA damage, senescence and even apoptosis in the myocardium, followed by fibroblasts undergoing proliferation to replace lost cardio myocytes(16). In addition, cardiac fibroblasts exhibit dynamic phenotypic changes to the proliferative phase due inflammation . Of these, TGF serves as the master switch, regulating the transition from inflammation to fibrosis (17). There is accumulating evidence for the link between inflammation, ageing and cardiac fibrosis (6,18). Ageing has been associated with low -grade systemic inflammation, that may be derived from a continued stress response (19). Low-grade systemic inflammation , characteri sed by increased systemic levels of specific cytokines and C -reactive protein (CRP) , has been closely linked with fibrosis (20). Both the expression of inflammatory gene s (Ccl5, Ccl11, and Ccl8) and the concentration of inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-6 and IL-13) show a strong positive correlation with ageing and fibrosis in vivo (21). Furthermore, some cytokines have been reported to promote cardiac fibrosis in ageing directly. Galectin -3, promotes collagen synthesis, deposition , and fibrosis by regulating MMPs/TIMPs levels (22), Author ManuscriptThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved as well as independently predict ing all-cause mortality (23). Cardiotrophin- 1 is a cytokine related to cardiac hypertrophy which and MMP -13) (24), and inducing fibroblast proliferation and/or differentiation (25). In the mouse model, aged cardiotrophin 1 -/- mice demonstrate reduced arterial fibrosis and greater longevity ( 26). Therefore, inflammatory factors may be one of the key contributors in age - related cardiac fibrosis through collagen turnover and cell ular proliferation/ differentiation. 3.2. Hemodynamic factors Hypertension is commonly found in old er persons. With ageing, vasculature undergoes structural and functional changes , characteri sed by endothelial dysfunction, wall thickening, reduced contractility, and arterial stiffening. Current evidence demonstrates a close relationship between hypertension and cardiac fibrosis (27). A previous study found that the accumulation of collagen during natural ageing, chronic hypertension, and in vitro myofibroblast senescence, shar e many common protein profiles , suggesting that fibrosis arising from ageing may have common underlying mechanisms with hypertension (28). On the other hand, there are a series of hemodynamic factors possessing fibrogenic effects , independent of the influences by blood pressure ,including the hormone factors from renin- angiotensin- aldosterone system (RAAS) and endothelin-1 (29,30). are closely linked with ageing-dependent cardiac fibrosis. Of these, the hormonal factors of the RAAS attracted the most attention, and arethe most important contributor . RAAS is a hormone system that is involved in the regulation of the plasma sodium concentration and blood pressure. When the plasma sodium conce ntration is lower than normal or the renal blood flow is reduced, pro -renin is converted into renin. Plasma renin then cleaves angiotensinogen to a short chain amino acid peptide known as angiotensin I (Ang I). Ang I is then converted to form an octa -peptide known as angiotensin II (Ang II), by the enzyme angiotensin -converting enzyme (ACE) found in the endothelial. Ang II results in increased arterial blood pressure and also stimulates the secretion of aldosterone, which causes the tubular epithelial cells to increase the reabsorption of sodium. Increased activation of the RAAS has been demonstrated in the ageing population by a previous study (31), which can result in hypertension- related fibrosis (32). Author ManuscriptThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved In aging, apart from its hypertensive effec t, RAAS activation directly affects progressive ageing-related organ fibrosis specifically in the heart and kidney. AngII alone can promote myofibroblast proliferation and stimulate ECM synthesis. Age -dependent stimulation of local RAAS in the myocardium drives cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, a feature that c an be replicated in young rats chronically infused with AngII (33,34. As another important vasoconstriction factor, endothelin -1, enhances fibronectin and collagen expression in an ageing model, suggest ing that ageing-related cardiac fibrosis is, at least in part, dependent on the upregulation of endothelin -1 (30). Currently, several target ed inhibitors of RAAS have been shown to inhibit the development of cardiac fibrosis in various experimental m odels of pathological cardiac remodelling(35). On the other hand, some vasodilation factors have been shown to have beneficial effects for fibrosis. They include relaxin and natriuretic peptides (ANP, BNP and CNP) which play important roles in ageing-dependent process es. Relaxin possess es various cardio -protective biological functions ( 36, 37) and reverses cardiac and renal fibrosis in spontaneously hypertensive rats (38). In ageing, -dependent and -independent vasodilator are which could induce fibrosis (39).The recombinant form of relaxin -2 showed potential clinical benefits for ageing-related atrial fibrillation by reversing atrial fibrosis and modulating cardiac ionic currents. (40). Natriuretic peptides functions to decrease blood pressure by suppressing the RAAS and increasing sodium and water excretion (41,42. In ageing, the levels of serum ANP and BNP are increased and serum CNP is decreased (43). ANP and CNP have been shown to inhibit collagen synthesis and fibroblast proliferation (44). In animal experimentation , plasma CNP in older rats was less than one-third of the level of young er rats. The fall in CNP was reciprocated by concurrent increases in left ventricular fibrosis (45). A progressive decline in circulating CNP was also noted in another study and was strongly associated with a reciprocal increase in cardiac fibrosis (43, 46) .The natriuretic peptides have been prove n to possess potent cardio- renal actions and are beginning to be regarded as a therapeutic target with clinical development underway ( 42). 3.3. Cellular senescence and death Cellular senescence is the phenomenon by which normal diploid cells cease to divi de. It is Author ManuscriptThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved characteri sed by a large flattened morphology, up -regulation of senescence -associated - galactosidase and proteins (such as p16, p19, p21 and p53). It is accompanied with ageing and ascribed to an accumulation of age -related damage , involving either myoc ytes or fibroblasts. More than 600 genes have been identified for cellular senescence, and of them, the p53/p21 pathway has been identified to play a key role (47). Heart intrinsic cellular senescence closely relate s to cardiac fibrosis , making cardiomyocytes vulnerable to certain stresses. Furthermore , senescence at a molecular level results in an accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) , generated from dysfunctional mitochondria , leading to inflammation , inducing apoptosis of cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts, and resulting in remodelling and fibrosis (48). p53 knockdown in cardiac fibroblasts in vivo, results in inhibition of senescence accompanied by reduced collagen production (49). This mechanism may be a result of suppressing inflammatory cytokines. As an anti-ageing factor, senescence marker protein 30 show s cardio-protective effect s through anti -oxidative effects and could be a novel therapeutic target to prevent ageing- related cardiac fibrosis (50). During ageing, c ardiac myocyte death is often the initial event responsible for activation of fibrogenic signals in the myocardium. Cardiac m yocyte death cause s stress, prompting the fibrotic response in cardiac tissues by a series of signalling cross-talk. Inflammatory cytokines and ROS promote cell death by activating both death receptor pathway s (activated by TNF ) and mitochondrial apoptotic pathway s (activated by ROS) causing further exacerbat ion of cardiac dysfunction (51) . Current therap ies for cardiac fibrosis usually focus on blocking the fibrosis pathway. However, these cannot eliminate the sustained fibrotic response activated by cell senescence and death. Therefore, in addition to targeting the initial triggers, anti-fibrosis treatment should also focus on interrupting the cycle of cell death to prevent further fibrosis (51). 3.4. Reactive Oxygen S pecies ROS are reactive chemical species containing oxygen, derived from NADPH oxidase within cell membranes, mitochondria, peroxisomes, and endoplasmic reticulum, all of which play important role s in immune defences (52). However, overexpression of ROS can potentially cause ce llular damage by impairing DNA /RNA synthesisand protein functions , Author ManuscriptThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved and accelerating the ageing process. In fibrosis, fibroblasts and epithelial cells have been well documented to utilise mitochondrial ROS as second messengers to facilitate diverse signal transduction pathways (53). Some cytokines are involved in ROS -induced differentiation of fibroblasts such as TGF , which has been reported to require ROS for the induction of differentiation (54,55. Accumulating evidence suggests that Nox4 NADPH oxidase may TGF /Smad signalling in a feed- forward manner 56,57). ROS may also play an important role in the RAAS-dependent ageing fibrosis process, since RAAS inhibition NADPH oxidative components p22phox, p47phox, and gp91phox (34). In addition , accumulation of ROS induces cell apoptosis through a mitochondria- dependent pathway, which promote s stress and fibrosis (51). Interestingly, under certain conditions like hyperglyca emia, the hydrogen peroxide -producing NADPH oxidase subtype show s anti-fibrotic effects. A previous study found that NOX4 inhibits smooth muscle cells pathophysiological proliferation in diabetic Apoe -/- mice in vivo through PDGF and NOX1 activation (58). Further investigation is needed to provide more evidence for the role of ROS in ageing related cardiac fibrosis. 3.5. Other factor s In addition to the aforementioned factors , there are other age-related mechanisms that promote cardiac of fibrinolysis, which can regulate the dissolution of fibrin and also inhibit the degradation of the ECM by reducing plasmin generation. PAI -1 is significantly upregulated in a variety of pathologies associated with the process ion of ageing (59). The lysosomal cysteine protease ,cathepsin K , shown to attenuate age ing- related cardiac fibrosis via suppression of cellular apoptosis (48). 4. Molecular Mechanism s Upon comprehensive analysis of the GEO public database (GSE8146) (60), which documents the different ial expression of genes of the heart between old and young mice , the results show that the old heart is characteri sed by changes in the cellular cycle, adaptive immunity , metabolic shift and cell death cycle (61) as shown with GO (BP) enrichment (Figure1.A) and Author ManuscriptThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved reactome pathway enrichment ( Figure2.B). These show that the ageing process involve s a series of important cellular signalling events, such as the mitogen- activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway, TGF -/Smad signalling pathway and a series of noncoding RNA and autophagy pathways 4.1.MAPK signalling pathway The MAPK signalling pathways may be the key signalling modulator linking a multitu de of adverse contributors to detrimental effects on cardiac function , including fibrosis in ageing . Mammals express at least four distinctly regulated groups of MAPKs including extracellular or MEKs ). MAPK signalling activates at least 20 transcript ion factors, and is involved in a series of other signalling pathways(62,63). The MAPK signalling pathway is responsible for various cellular functions, including cell ular apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation and migration (64). It is suggested that MAPK signalling is increased during ageing (65-67). The activation of p38 MAPK due to endoplasmic reticulum stress has been found to promote cardiac myocytes apoptosis in ageing mice, which in turn promotes cardiac stress and induce s fibrosis (68). Activation of ERK1/2 MAPK signalling has been shown to contribute to cardiac fibrosis through TGF/Smad signalling in aged PAI -1 deficient mice (69). Recently, Inhibition of the MAPK signalling pathway has been regarded as a potential therapeutic target for ageing-related fibrosis and other degenerative changes. The inhibition of apoptosis singnal regulated kinase 1 stress p38 MAPK signalling ( 70). Cardiac fibrosis can also be alleviated by other small molecules, including scutellarin, rosmarinic acid and phosphocreatine, through inhibition of MAPK 73). 4.2. TGF /Smad signalling pathway In TGF/Smad signalling, the Smad complex, made up of co -mediator Smad . Then the Smad complexes activate specific gene transcription through cooperative interactions with other DNA -binding and coactivator proteins (74). In Author ManuscriptThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved fibrosis, TGF-not only directly stimulate s ECM expression , but also exerts its potent matrix - preserving actions by suppressing the activity of MMPs and inducing synthesis of protease inhibitors, such as PAI -1 and TIMPs (6, 75). It also play s a key role in the process of EMT and EndMT when Smad2/3/4 complex recruits EMT-promoting transcription factors as co- activators, such as TWISTs (76). Even though, others have observed higher levels of TGF and phosphorylation of Smad2 in ageing hearts (77). Our previous studies showed no major variations in mRNA levels of TGF in myocardium during ageing (78, 79). However, higher levels of TGF and phosphorylation of Smad2 have been observed in ageing hearts(80). This disparity may be due to the levels of TGF being increased in heart connective tissue, and not in myocytes (77). Furthermore, some ageing related factor s such as MMP -9 can activate latent TGF, leading to further activation of S mad signalling ( 80). Interventions directly targeting this pathway have been shown to have undesired systemic side effects due to the pleiotropic physiologica l functions of TGF (81). Therefore , targeting downstream signalling pathways involved in TGF -induced processes may be a better option to prevent fibrosis in ageing (82,83. 4.3. Noncoding RNA Currently it is estimated that nearly a quarter of t he human genome can be transcribed into RNA, whereas protein -coding genes make up only 1% -2% of the genome (84). Noncoding RNA transcri ptions are a class of the RNA species and are categoris ed into small noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding (lncRNAs) (85). These various effects in regulati ng gene expression, including transcriptional regulation lncRNA by recruiting chromatin regulatory proteins to specific genomic locations, genomic imprinting, organisation of protein complexes, and shaping distinct nuclear structures (86). To date, many miRNAs have been confirmed to be involve d in cardiac fibrosis. The targets of these and miR-34) are mostly apoptosis (C-fos, foxO3) and stress signalling (p38 MAPK) (85). In animal and clinic al experiments, a series of miRNAs have been link ed to ageing related Author ManuscriptThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved cardiac fibrosis. Compared with young mice, older mice possess higher miR -22 levels in cardiac tissue, contributing to increased senescence and activat ion of cardiac fibroblasts in the ageing heart (87). The anti-fibrotic factor, miR -17, acts as a negative modulator of c ardiac cellular senescence by receptor-4 (PAR4). miR17 is down-regulated in the elderly (88). Other miRNAs such as miR -34a show both protective effects by inhibiting age -related cardiomyocyte death and remodelling and anti -protective effects when overexpressed , by promoting pro -inflammatory factor secretion in SMC and inducing in flammation (89), (90). In the context of h eart disease, the role of miRNAs have been intensely studied, whereas the role of lncRNAs remains largely unexplored. To date, only a few lncRNAs have been characteri sed for their function. MHC -associated RNA transcript , (Mhrt) and CHRF (AK048451), have been implicated in cardiac hypertrophy. Mhrt can bind to the BRM/SWI2 - related gene helicase domain and prevent it from recogni sing genomic DNA targets, which has been shown to be reactivated in cardiac stress and promote pathological gene expression (91). CHRF is significantly upregulated in heart failure p atients, and it has been found to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis in vitro (92), as well as being up- regulated in cardiac fibrosis models (93). The complex roles of non -coding RNAs, including miRNAs and lncRNAs, in ageing- related cardiac fibrosis are yet to be fully explored. 4.4. Autophagy Autophagy is the natural, destructiv e mechanism by which cytoplasmic constituents, including organelles and intracellular pathogens, are sequestered in a double -membrane- bound auto -phagosome and delivered to the lysosome for degradation and involves regulation of autophagy -related genes. In the ageing heart, damaging of proteins, DNA and cellular organelles , promotes stress in cardiac myocyte s and further induce s cellular apoptosis and death. Sufficient evidence sugge sts that autophagy flux is downregulated in the heart during ageing. Persistent inflammation, cellular senescence and depression of up -regulators, such as Sirt, may be the cause of this (94,95. Failure of cardiac cells to undergo autophagy is thought to be one of the main reasons for promoting cardiac damage in ageing (96). Ageing is also characteri sed by the loss of stress-induced adaptations capacity, which may result partly from the suppression of autophagy , and lack of autophagy during stress appears to promote Author ManuscriptThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved cell death and morbidity (97, 98). Stress factors, such as ROS, regulate the activity of the protein kinases, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP -activated protein kinase (AMPK) (98). In ageing animal models, several targets including CREG1 (99), Atrogin - 1(100), Calstabin2 and Akt (101, 102), are down regulated and have been identified for the amelioration of myocardial fibrosis by the activation of autophagy. Furthermore , obesity and/or metabolic syndrome s in older persons may also in duce progressive changes in myocardial inflam mation, apoptosis and fibrosis which involves the activation of mTOR signalling and depression of autophagy (103). Calorie restriction may exert a cardiac protective effect by attenuation of mitochondrial ROS production, activate autophagy and inhibit inflammatory signalling pathways (104). Restoring autophagy in the ageing heart may be a potential strategy for treating ageing-related cardiac fibrosis in the future. 5. Conclusion The process of cardiac fibrosis involves increased collagen expression and deposition due to fibrogenic growth factors, cellular trans -differentiation by inflammation oxidative stress senescence and apoptosis . The mechanisms of ageing related to cardiac fibrosis may be explained by a series of fibrogenic pathway s, such as activation of MAPK and TGF /Smad pathways, and depression of autophagy. Many of the factors and mechanisms involved in ageing-related cardiac fibrosis are operative in disease or pathological conditions in the younger heart. However, there are significant characteristic difference particular ly the imbalance of pro - and anti-fibrotic factors in ageing. Further investigation is likely to develop novel strategies that may potentially reduce cardiac fibrosis in the elderly. Furthermore, novel therapeutic targets have been identified which could lead to the development of new treatments for the management of ageing- related cardiac fibrosis.

Enrichment analysis for different expression of genes in the heart of old mice show tha t biological processes mostly involve cellular cycle, adaptive immune, metabolic shift and cellular death (A). The genes involved in stress signalling and adaptive protection a re differentially expressed (B). The data was derived from the GEO public databas e (GSE8146) and figures are draw by Reactom ePA package in R/Bioconductor. The data was derived from the control and old heart animal model of the GEO public database (GSE8146, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE8146), and Figures were created with the ReactomePA package in R/Bioconductor. The GEO is a public repository that archives and freely distributes microarray, next -generation sequencing, and other forms of high -throughput functional genomic data submitted by the scientific community. The data from GEO can be re -analyzed and published freely (https://www. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/home/about/policies.shtml). We have re -analyzed the raw data from the database and the results are include it in our manuscript. Some of the matrix data from cDNA microarray (cDNA chip) have been published before by others who als o analyzed the same database from a different prospective (Reiter E, Mol Aspects Med 2007, 28(5-6):668-91).
