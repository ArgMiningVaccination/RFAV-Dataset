But the good news is that the vaccine has greatly reduced the number of people who get it. Two doses of the chickenpox vaccine are over 90% effective at preventing it. Most people who get the vaccine don't get chickenpox \u2014 and those who do usually get a much milder version of the disease. There are 2 vaccines that protect against chickenpox: The chickenpox vaccine protects children and adults from chickenpox The MMRV vaccine protects children from measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox Frequently Asked Questions Why is the chickenpox vaccine important? Chickenpox is very contagious \u2014 it spreads easily from person to person. And while it's usually mild, it can cause serious complications like pneumonia (lung infection). Certain people \u2014 like infants, people with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women \u2014 are at increased risk for complications. The chickenpox virus can also cause shingles later in life. Shingles is a disease that causes a painful skin rash and can affect the nervous system. Children who get the chickenpox vaccine may have a lower risk of developing shingles later on \u2014 and those who do get shingles often have a milder case than someone who has had chickenpox. Getting vaccinated is the best way to prevent chickenpox. And when enough people get vaccinated against chickenpox, the entire community is less likely to get it. So when you and your family get vaccinated, you help keep yourselves and your community healthy. Learn more about how vaccines help protect your whole community. What is chickenpox? Chickenpox is caused by a virus. Symptoms of chickenpox include: A red, itchy skin rash with blisters Fever Feeling tired Not feeling hungry Headache Chickenpox usually spreads when a person touches chickenpox or shingles blisters \u2014 or if they breathe in the virus. You can breathe in the virus after someone with chickenpox or shingles scratches their blisters, which releases the virus into the air. It's also possible to get chickenpox from breathing in tiny droplets from people who have it that get into the air after they breathe or talk. Learn more about chickenpox.
