In addition, College of Nursing students participate in many clinical experiences and must comply with the standards agreed upon by our clinical partners. Students are expected to provide documented proof of the following health requirements upon acceptance into the college. College of Nursing contracts with Castle Branch, a service that allows students to order their own background checks online and to store all requirement documentation. Criminal Background Check and Abuse Registry Checks Ordered by student after acceptance in the program MMR Verification of 2 vaccines or 3 positive antibody titers showing immunity of each of the following: measles, mumps and rubella. Varicella showing positive immunity. Td/Tdap(tetanus/diphtheria) Tetanus/diphtheria/pertussis: 1 Td at least every 10 years. Must have documentation of 1 Tdap vaccine. Hepatitis B Vaccine and Titer: - Vaccine series completed at the appropriate intervals, followed by an antibody titer. The titer is REQUIRED, even if series was completed as a child. - If the Hep B titer is negative, you will need to repeat the Hep B series and have a titer drawn 4-6 weeks after the final vaccine. - If you do not have Hep B vaccination records but believe you got them, you can get the titer to check for immunity. TB Skin Test or IGRA (Interferon Gamma Release Assay - QuantiFERON-TB Gold or T-Spot) - TB Skin Test (2-step skin test required) If you have documentation of (1) negative TST in the past 12 months, or documentation of (2) negative TSTs in your past, you need one more TST to meet the two-step requirement. A TST or IGRA is also required annually, after the two-step is completed initially. - If you have never had any TB skin testing, the two-step TST is done as follows: The first test is placed, and results are read in 48-72 hrs. The second test is placed at least 7 days after the reading of the first test, and read at 48-72 hrs. Send documentation of both tests, and include placement date, reading date, result and mm induration. - Those with a history of a positive TST or IGRA must provide a copy of the CXR (Chest x-ray) report. If treated for LTBI (Latent TB Infection), provide medication treatment dates. Students with a history of a positive TST are also required to complete a symptom assessment initially and annually.
