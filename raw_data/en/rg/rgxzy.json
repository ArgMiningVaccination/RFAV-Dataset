Luckily, our body has developed the amazing ability to fight off these invaders in order to keep us healthy. The immune system is our body's first line of defense against these viruses, bacteria, and other invaders. How does the immune system work? When the body senses a bacteria, virus, or other unknown substance, it immediately rushes white blood cells and antibodies to the area of infection. These specialized cells surround and destroy the foreign invaders. Of course, the immune system is not always enough to completely keep us healthy. There will always be times when it is necessary to use modern medicine to help fight illness. But keeping your immune system strong and balanced is your first and best defense against many common, everyday illnesses. And acupuncture and massage therapy can help bring your body back into proper balance and build a strong, healthy immune system. A Holistic Approach to a Healthy Immune System We know that our best defense against many illnesses is a strong immune system. Unfortunately, many features of modern life work against a healthy immune response. Stress, lack of sleep, and poor nutrition are just a few things that can undermine our body's natural defense systems. And unfortunately, once the immune system is compromised, we become vulnerable to common pathogens causing colds, the flu, allergies, and infection. A holistic approach to a strong immune system includes establishing a healthy lifestyle, including good nutrition and adequate sleep patterns. You may also want to consider incorporating acupuncture and massage into your holistic approach. Both acupuncture and massage have been shown to have a powerful boosting effect on the immune system. One of the primary benefits of both massage therapy and acupuncture is restoring the proper flow of fluids around the body. Stimulating proper blood flow ensures that healthy cells get adequate oxygen and nutrients. It can ensures that illness-fighting white blood cells and antibodies can get to infected areas. And it helps in the more efficient removal of toxins and harmful pathogens. Massage and acupuncture help to stimulate the autonomic nervous system Massage and acupuncture also help to stimulate the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system regulates all of our body's automatic functions, including the natural immune response to disease. By bringing the body back into balance with itself, the autonomic nervous system can more effectively focus on fighting off foreign invaders. Finally, both acupuncture and massage therapy can reduce the level of cortisol, also known as the \"stress hormone\", in the body. Elevated levels of cortisol due to stress can inhibit the proper function of the immune system. Stimulating relaxation and stress-reduction reduces cortisol levels, again enabling the body to focus on its ability to self-heal. Neither massage therapy nor acupuncture can cure common ailments like a cold or the flu. But, they can play a vital role in keeping you healthy by strengthening your natural self-healing mechanism: the immune system. So if you are concerned that a weakened immune system may be compromising your ability to fight off the common cold, the flu, and other seasonal illnesses, schedule your acupuncture and massage therapy treatments today.
