NOTE: Other factors, such as race , ethnicity , disability or houselessness place individual patients at hig h r isk for progression to severe COVID -19. Data indicates that: Patients of color or from tribal communities are most harmed by health inequities and the ris k of h ospitalization and death for these groups is greater than that of white patients. These patients may face higher risk than white patients, due to longstanding societal injustice s i ncluding racism, discrimination, colonization, etc., which have and continue to negativel y i mpact health outcomes. For this reason, people who identify as Black /African American, Latino/a /x, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander are eligible for REGEN - COV under this protocol . Patients with the following disabilities might be at increased risk of becoming infected or having unrecognized illness or progression to severe disease. People who have limited mobility or who cannot avoid coming into close contact with others who may be infected, such as direct support providers and family members People who have trouble understanding information or practicing preventive measures,such as hand washing and social distancing People who may not be able to communicate symptoms of illness https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/humandevelopment/covid- 19/people -with -disabilities.html There is increased transmission of virus in congregate settings and outdoor settings that do n ot provide protection from the environment, adequate access to hygiene and sanitation facilities, or connection to services and healthcare. These settings include houselessness, sleeping outdoors or in an encampment setting. Pharmacist must obtain patient weight, height, and calculate BMI to verify condition of overweight/obese in #7M on the Patient Intake Form . https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm If YES to either question above , proceed to Step 4. If NO, COVID monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment is not indicated at this time and pharmacists are not authorized to prescribe or administer COVID mAb treatment in accordance with this RPH protocol. Refer the patient for further evaluation and management by the patient's primary care provider. 4)Allergy Screen (Form Qs: 9) a.Does the patient have a known hypersensitivity to any ingredient of REGEN-COV ?

REGEN -COV is not authorized for pre-exposure prophylaxis for prevention of COVID -19. II. PATIENT ELIGIBILITY : An eligible patient must meet the criteria within one of the two authorized indications. For both indications, a patient must be at high risk for progression to severe COVID -19, including hospitalization or death. Patients at high risk include, but are not limited to, individuals with at least one of th e f ollowing r isk factors: Older age (age 65 years of age) Obesity or being overweight (BMI >25 kg/m2, or if age 12-17 years, have BMI 85th percentile for their age and gender based on CDC growth charts, https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/clinical_charts.htm ) Pregnancy Chronic kidney disease Diabetes Immunosuppressive disease or immunosuppressive treatment Cardiovascular disease (including congenital heart disease) or hypertension Chronic lung disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma [moderate-to -severe], interstitial lung disease, cystic fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension) Sickle cell disease Neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., cerebral palsy) or other conditions that confer medicalcomplexity (e.g., genetic or metabolic syndromes and severe congenital anomalies) Have a medical -related technological dependence (e.g., tracheostomy, gastrostomy, or positiv e pr essure ventilation (not related to COVID 19) Authorization of REGEN -COV under the EUA is not limited to the medical conditions or factors listed above . Other factors , such as race or ethnicity may also place individual patients at high risk for progression to severe COVID -19. For example, data show that patients of color or from tribal communities are most harmed by health inequities and the risk of hospitalization and death for these groups is greater than that of white patients. These patients may face higher risk than white patients, due to longstanding societal injustices including racism, discrimination, colonization, etc ., which have and continue to negatively impact health outcomes. For this reason, people who identify as Black, African American, Latina/o/x, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Asian American or Pacific Islander are eligible for REGEN -COV under this protocol. If a patient requesting monoclonal antibody treatment does not fall into one of the categories specified above, pharmacists should refer the patient to a medical provider for risk -benefit consideration.

ADMINISTRATION OF SUBCUTANEOUS INJECTION: Administer the subcutaneous injections consecutively, each at a different injection site, into the thigh, back of the upper arm, or abdomen, except for 2 inches (5 cm) around the navel. The waistline should be avoided. When administering the subcutaneous injections, it is recommended that providers use different quadrants of the abdomen or upper thighs or back of the upper arms to space apart each 2.5 mL subcutaneous injection of casirivimab and imdevimab. DO NOT inject into skin that is tender, damaged, bruised, or scarred. IX. POST -TREATMENT MONITORING: Ask patient to remain seated in the clinic for 60 minutes after administering therapy to decrease the risk of injury s hould they faint and for the Pharmacist to monitor for visible signs of drug reactions and for anaphylaxis . Pharmacists must submit a report on all medication errors and any witnessed or known SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS potentially related to REGEN -COV . See Section Adverse Reactions and Medication Errors Reporting Requirements and Instructions . Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis : REGEN -COV may only be administered in settings in which pharmacists have immediate access to medications to treat se vere hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis, and the ability to activate the emergency medical system (EMS), as necessary. If signs or symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, Pharmacists must immediately discontinue administration and follow the Oregon Immunization Program's Guidelines for Managing Severe Adverse Events Following Immunization . 15 of 28Standardized Assessment and Treatment Care Pathway COVID Monoclonal Antibodies (REGEN- COV) Oregon Board of Pharmacy v. 08/2021 Page 11 of 16 of COVID mAb Assessment and Treatment Care PathwayClinical Worsening After Administration : Clinical worsening of COVID -19 after administration of REGEN -COV has be en reported and may include signs or symptoms of fever, hypoxia or increased respiratory difficulty, arrhythmia (e.g., atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, bradycardia), fatigue, and altered mental status.

Appr oximately 13,500 subjects received intravenous infusions and injections. The safety of REGEN -COV (casirivimab and imdevimab) based on analyses -2067, a Phase 1/2/3 trial of ambulatory (non-hospitalized) subjects with COVID -19; COV -2069, a Phase 3 post -exposure prophylaxis trial for prevention of COVID -19; and COV -2093, a Phase 1 trial evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of REGEN -COV repeat subcutaneous dosing every 4 weeks for 24 weeks. COV -2067 : This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled clinical trial (NCT04425629) in subjects with mild to moderate COVID -19. In the phase 3 portion of the trial, subjects were treated with a single intravenous infusion of 600 mg of casirivima b and 600 mg of imdevimab (n=827), or 1,200 mg of casirivimab and 1,200 mg of imdevimab (n=1,849) (unauthorized dose under EUA ), or 4,000 mg of casirivimab and 4,000 mg of imdevimab (n=1,012) (unauthorized dose under EUA ), or placebo (n=1,843). At baseline, in all randomized subjects with at least one risk factor, the median age was 50 years (with 13% of subjects ages 65 years or older), 52% of the subjects were female, 84% were White, 36% were Hispanic or Latino, and only 5% were Black or African American. In subjects with available baseline symptom data, 15% had mild symptoms, 42% had moderate, 42% had severe symptoms, and 2% reported no symptoms at baseline; the median duration of symptoms was 3 days. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects wi th 1 COVID -19-related hospitalization or all- cause death through Day 29. The results for subjects treated with 600 mg of casirivumab and 600 mg of imdevimab compared to placebo are outlined in Table 1 . Table 1.

In pooled phase 1/2/3 analysis, infusion -related reactions (adverse event assessed as causally related by the investigator) of grade 2 or higher severity have been observed in 10/4,206 (0.2%) of those who received REGEN -COV at the authorized dose or a higher dose. The infusion was permanently discontinued in 4 subjects who developed infusion -related reactions (urticaria, pruritus, flushing, 19 of 28Standardized Assessment and Treatment Care Pathway COVID Monoclonal Antibodies (REGEN- COV) Oregon Board of Pharmacy v. 08/2021 Page 15 of 16 of COVID mAb Assessment and Treatment Care Pathwaypyrexia, shortness of breath, chest tightness, nausea, vomiting, rash) but each received doses higher than what is au thorized under EUA. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported in subjects receiving REGEN -COV . The events began within 1 hour of completion of the infusion, and in at least one case required treatment including epinephrine. The events resolved. COV -2069: This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled clinical trial (NCT04452318) that assessed the efficacy and safety of REGEN -COV (casirivimab and imdevimab) for post -exposure prophylaxis of COVID -19 in household contacts of individuals in fected with SARS-CoV-2. The trial enrolled subjects who were asymptomatic and who lived in the same household with a SARS -CoV-2 infected patient. Subjects who were SARS-CoV-2 negative (PCR negative and seronegative) at baseline were enrolled and received a single dose of 600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab subcutaneously (n=751) or placebo (n=752). Subjects who were SARS -CoV-2 positive at baseline were enrolled in Cohort B and received a single dose of 600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab subcutaneously or placebo. Cohort A: At baseline, the median age was 44 years (with 9% of subjects ages 65 years or older), 54% of the subjects were female, 86% were White, 41% were Hispanic or Latino, and 9% were Black or African American. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects who developed PCR -confirmed COVID -19 through Day 29. The results for subjects treated with 600 mg of casirivumab and 600 mg of imdevimab compared to placebo are outlined in Table 2 . In a post- hoc analysis in a subgroup of subjects who met the criteria for high risk for progression to severe COVID -19, there was a 76% relative risk reduction in COVID -19 with REGEN -COV treatment versus placebo ratio 2.

SARS -CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID -19. This Fact Sheet contains information to help you understand the potential risks and potential benef its of t aking REGEN -COV. Receiving REGEN -COV may benefit certain people with COVID -19 and may help prevent certain people who have been exposed to someone who is infected with SARS-CoV-2 from getting SARS-CoV-2 infection, or may prevent certain people who are at high risk of exposure to someone who is infected with SARS-CoV-2 from getting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Read this Fact Sheet for information about REGEN- COV. Ta lk to your healthcare prov ider if you have questions. It i s your choice to receive REGEN -COV or stop at any time. WHAT IS COVID-19? COV ID-19 i s caused by a v irus c alled a cor onav irus, SARS -CoV-2. People can get COV ID-19 through contact wi th another person who has the vi rus. COV I D-19 illnes ses have ranged from very mild ( including some wi th no repor ted symptoms) to severe, including i llnes s resu lting in death. Whil e informat ion so f ar suggests t hat most COVID-19 ill ness i s mild, ser ious ill ness can happen and may cause some of your ot her med ical conditions to become w orse. People of all ages wi th severe, long- lasting (chronic) m edical conditions li ke heart d isease, lung di sease, and di abetes, f or examp le, and other conditions including obesity, seem to be at higher risk of being hosp italized for COV ID-19. Older age, with or without other conditions, also places people at higher risk of being hospitalized for COVID- 19. WH AT ARE THE SYMPT OMS OF COVID-19? The symptoms of COVID -19 include fe ver, cough, and short ness of bre ath, whi ch m ay appear 2 to 14 days a fter exposure. Serious illness including breathing problems can occur and may cause your other medical conditions to become worse. WH AT IS REGEN -COV (casirivimab and imdevimab)? REGEN -COV is an investigational medicine used in adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older who weigh at least 88 pounds (40 kg)) who are at high risk for severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death for: treatment of mild to moderate symptoms of COVID -19 post-exposure prevention of COVID -19 in persons who are: onot fully vaccinated against COVID -19 ( Individuals are considered to be fully vaccinated 2 weeks after their second vaccine dose in a 2 -dose series [such as the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines], or 2 weeks after a single- dose vaccine [such as Johnson & Johnson's Janssen vaccine]), or , oare not expected to build up enough of an immune response to the complete COVID-19 vaccination (for example, someone with immunocompromising 23 of 28P age 2 of 5 conditions, including someone who is taking immunosuppressive medications), and have been exposed to someone who is infected with SARS -CoV-2. Close contact with someone who is infected with SARS-CoV-2 is defined asbeing within 6 feet for a total of 15 minutes or more, providing care athome to someone who is sick, having direct physical contact with theperson (hugging or kissing, for example), sharing eating or drinkingutensils, or being exposed to respiratory droplets from an infected person(sneezing or coughing, for example). For additional details, go to https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you- are- sick/quarantine.html , or someone who is at high risk of being exposed to someone who is infectedwith SARS -CoV-2 because of occurrence of SARS -CoV-2 infection in other individuals in the same institutional setting (for example, as nursinghomes, prisons,). R EGEN -COV is investigational because it is still being studied. There is limited information known about the safety and effectiveness of using REGEN -COV to treat people with COVID -19 or to prevent COVID -19 in people who are at high risk of being exposed to someone who is infected with SARS -CoV-2. REGEN -COV is not authorized for pre-exposure prophylaxis for prevention of COVID-19. The FDA has authorized the emergency use of REGEN- COV for the treatment of COVID -19 and the post-exposure prevention of COVID-19 under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). For more information on EUA, see the \"What is an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)?\" section at the end of this Fact Sheet. WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE REGEN -COV? Do not take REGEN-COV if you have had a severe allergic reaction to REGEN -COV. W HAT SHOULD I TELL MY HEALTH CARE PROVIDER BEFORE I RECEIVE REGEN -COV? Tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: Have any allergies Have had a severe allergic reaction including anaphylaxis to REGEN-COV previously Have received a COVID -19 vaccine. Have any serious illnesses Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant Are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed Are taking any medications (prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, and herbalproducts) HOW WILL I RECEIVE REGEN -COV (casirivimab and imdevimab)? -COV consists of two investigational medicines, casirivimab and imdevimab, given together at the same time through a vein (intravenous or IV) or injected in the 24 of 28P age 3 of 5 tissue just under the skin (subcutaneous injections). Your healthcare provider will determine th e most appropriate way for you to be given REGEN- COV. Treatment: If you are receiving an intravenous infusion, the infusion will take 20 to 50 minutes or longer. Your healthcare provider will determine the duration of your infusion. oIf your healthcare provider determines that you are unable to receive REGEN-COV as an intravenous infusion which would lead to a delay in treatment, then asan alternative, REGEN -COV can be given in the form of subcutaneous injections. If you are receiving subcutaneous injections, your dose will be provided asmultiple injections given in separate locations around the same time. Post-exposure prevention: If you are receiving subcutaneous injections, your dose willbe provided as multiple injections given in separate locations around the same time. Ifyou are receiving an intravenous infusion, the infusion will take 20 to 50 minutes orlonger. oAfter the initial dose, if your healthcare provider determines that you need toreceive additional doses of REGEN -COV for ongoing protection, the additional intravenous or subcutaneous doses would be administered monthly. WHAT ARE THE IMPORTANT POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS OF REGEN -COV (casirivimab and imdevimab)? Possible side effects of REGEN -COV are: Allergic reactions. Allergic reactions can happen during and after infusion or injection of REGEN -COV. Tell your healthcare provider right away or seek immediate medical attention if you get any of the following signs and symptoms of allergic reactions: fever, chills, nausea, headache, shortness of breath, low or high blood pressure, rapid or slowheart rate, chest discomfort or pain, weakness, confusion, feeling tired, wheezing,swelling of your lips, face, or throat, rash including hives, itching, muscle aches, feeling faint, dizziness and sweating. These reactions may be severe or life threatening. Worsening symptoms after treatment: You may experience new or worsening symptoms after infusion or injection , including fever, difficulty breathing, rapid or slow heart rate, tiredness, weakness or confusion. If these symptoms occur, contact your healthcare provider or seek immediate medical attention as some of these symptoms have requiredhospitalization. It is unknown if these symptoms are related to treatment or are due to theprogression of COVID-19. The side effects of getting any medicine by vein may include brief pain, bleeding, bruising of the skin, soreness, swelling, and possible infection at the infus ion site. The side effects of getting any medicine by subcutaneous injection may include pain, bruising of the skin, soreness, swelling, and possible infection at the injection site. These are not all the possible side effects of REGEN- COV. Not a lot of people have been given REGEN -COV. Serious and unexpected side effects may happen. REGEN -COV is still being studied so it is possible that all of the risks are not known at this time. It is possible that REGEN- COV could interfere with your body's own ability to fight off a future infection of SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, REGEN -COV may reduce your body's immune response to a vaccine for SARS -CoV-2. Specific studies have not been conducted to address these possible risks. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have any questions. 25 of 28Pa ge 4 of 5 WH AT O THER TREA TMENT C HOI -COV (casirivimab and imdevimab) , FDA may allow for the emergency use of other medicines to treat people with COVID -19. Go -use- authorization for information on the emergency use of other medicines that are not approved by FDA that are used to treat people with COVID -19. Your healthcare provider may talk with you about clinical trials you may be eligible for. It is your choice to be treated or not to be treated with REGEN -COV. Should you decide not to receive REGEN -COV or stop it at any time, it will not change your standard medical care. WH AT O THER PREVENTION CHOI CES ARE TH ERE? Vaccines to prevent COVID -19 are also available under Emergency Use Authorization. Use of REGEN -COV does not replace vaccination against COVID -19. REGEN -COV is not authorized for pre -exposure prophylaxis for prevention of COVID-19. WH AT IF I AM PREGNANT OR BR EAST FEEDING? There is limited experience using REGEN- COV (casirivimab and imdevimab) in pregnant women or breastfeeding mothers. For a mother and unborn baby, the benefit of receiving REGEN -COV may be greater than the risk of using the product . If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, discuss your options and specific situation with your healthcare provider.

The United States FDA has made REGEN -COV (casirivimab and imdevimab) available under an emergency access mechanism called an EUA. The EUA is supported by a Secretary of Health and Human Service (HHS) declaration that circumstances exist to justify the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic. 26 of 28Pa ge 5 of 5 REGEN -COV has not undergone the same type of review as an FDA-approved product. In issuing an EUA under the COVID-19 public health emergency, the FDA must determine, among other things, that based on the totality of scientific evidence available, it is reasonable to believe that the product may be effective for diagnosing, treating, or preventing COVID-19, or a serious or life -threatening disease or condition caused by COVID-19; that the known and potential benefits of the product, when used to diagnose, treat, or prevent such disease or condition, outweigh the known and potential risks of such product; and that there are no adequate, approved and available alternatives. All of these criteria must be met to allow for the medicine to be used in the treatment of COVID -19 or prevention of COVID -19 during the COVID-19 pandemic. The EUA for REGEN -COV is in effect for the duration of the COVID-19 declaration justifying emergency use of these products, unless terminated or revoked (after which the products may no longer be used).
