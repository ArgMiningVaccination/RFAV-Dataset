UnknownBackground and Overview Senate Bill 1 (2019) created the System of Care Advisory Council (\"the Council\") and identifies one of the duties of the Council to: \"Award grants for the purpose of supporting local system of care governance and for carrying out the recommendations in the Council's plan.\" The by-laws state the Council will award grants: to support and invest in local System of Care (SOC) initiatives, development, and system improvements; and to carry out recommendations generated by the SOC policy and long- range plan. The grant process has been driven by SOC values and principles, including meaningful youth and family involvement in all parts of the process. For this grant period, the focus is to increase the capacity of the local system of care governance infrastructure, including increasing meaningful family and youth involvement, where infrastructure is defined in the widest sense. The only established and state supported SOC governance and infrastructure throughout Oregon is the structure required in the Oregon Health Authority contract with Coordinated Care Organizations (CCOs). CCOs would function as the contractor with oversight provided by the SOC Executive Council, driven by meaningful family and youth involvement.

UnknownThe Domestic Violence High Risk Team (DVHRT) Model is a nationally recognized domestic violence homicide prevention framework, identified by the Department of Justice, Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) as a \"leading promising practice in the field.\" With a goal of preventing intimate partner homicides (IPH) and near-lethal assaults, the Model has been successfully replicated in a variety of jurisdictions across the country. Use of Evidence-based Risk Assessment to Identify High-Risk Victims Risk assessment instruments that predict lethal or near lethal violence are used within the model to identify cases that are escalating to lethal levels and to provide a response that matches the risk level. Research has found that many survivors of IPH have contact with law enforcement prior to their murder. Anywhere between 39-91% of female victims of IPH were in contact with law enforcement prior to their homicide. These findings indicate that law enforcement has a unique opportunity to identify cases that are escalating towards homicide. 1. THE DANGER ASSESSMENT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT (DA-LE) WAS DESIGNED TO WORK WITHIN THE DVHRT MODEL. The DA-LE is an 11-question, shorter derivative of the DA that is administered by law enforcement officers responding to calls involving IPV. It has a built-in cutoff score that screen approximately 30% of cases into the high-risk category. The lower screen in rate helps decision-makers focus on the most dangerous cases and helps to identify a manageable volume of cases for intensive risk management when used within the context of DVHRTs. The DA-LE The success of the DVHRT project will be statistically measured by the decrease or increase of reported intimate partner assaults, intimate partner homicides, number of survivors receiving services, and rate of perpetrator prosecution.BIPOC-AI/AN People living in rural areas People who identify as LGBTQ+ People with disabilities People with low incomes NO No No No Yes No Yes Yes No Yes LINC OWL Meeting Device Jackson County Community Services ConsortiumThe funds will be used to obtain a professional quality live streaming device to bring Latino/a/x Interagency Committee (LINC) meetings to people who cannot access the Monthly LINC meeting in person.b.Education for health improvement or education supports, including those related to SDOH-E; 1050Not available at this time.

This includes developing data-informed planning processes and frameworks to build an equitable, vibrant, and resilient local food system that is inclusive of all people and addresses the three key areas of opportunity and growth; (2) Collect and analyze quantitative and qualitative data within the three key areas of opportunity and to create innovative, sustainable, and community-driven solutions toward a more equitable, engaged, and resilient local food system. This includes conducting assessments and feasibility studies, as well as researching metrics to measure, evaluate, and document the partnership's work.

We want our efforts to be collaborative and coordinated, rather than competitive or decisive. One example is our partnership to fill in the gap with the local Food Bank. We support the Food Bank with our small Food Pantry during the days that the Food Bank does not distribute food. This way clients can have their needs met all days of the week.We will take count of the number of members in a household of the recipients when they drive through. We want to know the number of families served and the number of people served. We will also count the number of food bags assembled and compare with the number that are distributed. Did we over-estimate or under-estimate the need of our community? How well did we advertise for this opportunity? Based on the above information, what might we adjust for next year? Another part of our results is the number of volunteers that support this project. Who are the community groups that volunteered to help? We will request a sign-in on the day of assembly and distribution to collect data of the volunteers.

UnknownPY+ started in 1998 as a pilot substance abuse prevention program. After a few years, it became apparent that providing a stable professional adult mentor to at-risk youth not only prevented drug and alcohol abuse, it also increased the chances that the youth would thrive in school, jobs and life. PY+ has since been recognized as a \"Promising Practices Program\" by the National Prevention Network for its success in reducing school drop outs and increasing college readiness among students with multiple dropout risk factors. The PY+ WIT program specializes in catching youth who are on the verge of dropping out of school and helping them re-engage, gain skills, set goals, and build a pathway for a healthy future. The foundation of the WIT program is a one-on-one professional mentoring relationship between a student and PY+ Advisor. The goal is to provide a healthy, caring, stable adult mentor who is able to support each youth over the course of their middle and high school lives. This project will serve Grants Pass School District (GPSD) students in grades 6-12 at North Middle, South Middle, Grants Pass High, and Gladiola Alternative School. We partner with schools to identify at-risk youth as early as possible and begin to build strong bonds that can last through graduation and beyond. WIT layers a variety of youth development strategies into the mentorship relationship including coaching, social emotional learning skills, community engagement, workforce preparation, and family education. We utilize evidence-based models such as Positive Youth Development, Risk and Protective Factor theory, and 40 Developmental Assets in our work with local youth, as well as culturally and linguistically responsive practices.The WIT program will track participation rates in activities, school retention, absenteeism, graduation, GED, career connected learning experiences, and internship/work experience. Our Advisors collect this information for each youth participant. We also conduct an annual student survey and track the number of mentorship/coaching interactions we have with each student via contact logs.

By listening to and building power within our communities, the LGBTQ+ Listening Project is on the forefront of supporting our queer communities and filling a critical role of advocacy, organizing capacity, and infrastructural support across our rural communities.b.Education for health improvement or education supports, including those related to SDOH-E; 20000Not available at this time. UnknownLeadership by people most impacted: The LGBTQ+ Listening Project's work is guided by a steering committee of community members who reflect folks most impacted by intersecting oppressions. Trauma-informed: LGBTQ+ Listening Project staff bring training in cultural and arts-based work as well as trauma-informed practices like centering community care, building relationships, and facilitation that makes space for multiple ways of knowing and participating. Grounded in history and intergenerational learning: One of the ways colonialism and oppression operate in LGBTQ+ community is to erase our history and presence, and to disconnect youth from elders. Since people are not born into LGBTQ+ community, they rely on organizations and community centers to connect youth with the wisdom and lived experience of LGBTQ+ adults. The LGBTQ+ Listening Project steering committee is intentionally intergenerational and sees youth leadership development and partnering with agencies that serve older adults as critical to the work. Committed to collective liberation: The RAC believes that racism, and all its related forms of oppression, are rooted in unequal relationships of power and the structures which perpetuate these unequal distributions. The RAC works to dismantle systemic racism and the threat of white supremacy and far right organizing in Southern Oregon by changing the relations of power, and by confronting the forces and structures of white supremacy, while also building and exercising power among groups who have been systematically locked out of access to leadership and decision RAC staff will gather information about the number of people who participate in LGBTQ+ Listening Project events, along with demographics and feedback on peoples' experience of feeling connected. Staff will also look at how many people engage with the monthly newsletter of LGBTQ+ events/resources. Staff have mapped critical gaps in our local LGBTQ+ services. Staff look for reductions in the gaps and needs in our region. For example, in 2022, the LGBTQ+ Listening Project saw the creation of a group for parents of transgender youth, a group for transgender adults, Medford and Grants Pass Pride events, and a peer-led trans social group. Those all met critical needs in our region. There are also a lot of qualitative measures of the impact, including observing when folks use the resource pages to answer questions on online forums.People living in rural areas People who identify as LGBTQ+ People with low incomes NO Yes No No Yes No No Yes No Yes South Coast RHEC Development South Coast Equity CoalitionThe goods and/or services funded are intended to improve the overall member and community health and well-being of historically underserved and underrepresented people in Coos and Curry Counties by increasing the capacity of the South Coast Equity Coalition and our community partners to establish a Regional Health Equity Coalition (RHEC) on the South Coast.i.Other non-covered social and community health services and supports. 8250Not available at this time.

The result is a need for hybrid meetings. The State of Oregon has also implemented a new public meeting law that requires all public meetings to be offered virtually. We have seen virtual hybrid meetings held in many homegrown ways, but in the end they are generally poor quality and tend to hinder, rather than encourage public participation. We believe this professional caliber solution will support community groups and the library in its efforts to educate and encourage civic engagement.Success will look like regular meetings held in a seamless hybrid format because of the equipment's high audio and video quality, and its ease of use. Success will also be greater civic engagement in our community.

ACCO case management refers to the process of coordinating healthcare services and resources for OHP enrollees with complex medical needs. The goal of medical case management is to ensure that patients receive timely and appropriate care, avoid unnecessary hospitalizations or emergency department visits, and improve overall health outcomes. Case management services within AllCare include, but is not limited to: -Assessing patient needs in the context that medical case managers work with patients to identify their healthcare requirements and develop individualized care plans that address those needs. -Coordinating healthcare services. Medical case managers coordinate healthcare services and resources, including medical appointments, prescriptions, and referrals to specialists. -Case managers monitor patient progress and adjust care plans as necessary to ensure that patients are receiving the appropriate level of care. -Advocating for patients: Case managers advocate for patients to ensure that they receive the healthcare services and resources they need to improve health outcomes. Intensive medical case management (IMCM) is a specialized form of medical case management provided ACCO provides to Medicaid patients with complex medical needs. IMCM is a higher level of medical case management that involves more frequent and intensive interventions than traditional case management. IMCM is designed for patients who have complex medical and social issues that require close monitoring and coordination of care. Some examples of patients who may benefit from IMCM include those with multiple chronic conditions, mental health disorders, substance use disorders, or a history of frequent hospitalizations or emergency department visits. Intensive case management within AllCare typically involves a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, including medical case managers, nurses, social workers, and behavioral health specialists. The team works closely with the patient and their primary care provider to develop and implement a comprehensive care plan that addresses the patient's medical, social, and behavioral health needs.REPORT L6.4 -- CASE MANAGEMENT BREAKDOWN CONTRACTOR: Allcare CCO CALENDAR - CAP Pool 1 CAP Pool 2 CAP Pool 3 Check T otal CAP - - 2,597 Substance - - 128,115 - - - - - - - - 149 735 - - 735 DME and Miscellaneous 3 3 69 - - 69 Behav ioral Health Mental Health Serv 1,228 597 - - 21,620 - - - - - - - - Applied Behav ior Analysis (ABA) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ACT /SE - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - A&D Residential 11,790 - - 67,280 - - - - - - - - MH Children's Wraparound - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - CANS - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Mental Health Other Non-Inpatient - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Other Dental - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - NEMT - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 9,221 Expenditures for Inten.

Fourth quarter filing due April 30 may contain an estimate of SHARE contribution on Report L6. Purpose: To calculate the amount of a CCO's annual SHARE Initiative obligation according to requirements in OAR 410-141-3735, ORS 414.625(1)(b)(C) (as such statute was amended by 2018 HB 4018), and as set forth in contract and program guidance available on the CCO Contract Forms webpage. https://www.oregon.gov/oha/HSD/OHP/Pages/CCO-Contract-Forms.aspx In accordance with the statutory requirement, CCOs must \"designate a portion of annual net income or reserves that exceed the financial requirements,\" specified in OAR 410-141-5195 through OAR 410-141-5220, including maintaining at least 200% Risk-Based Capital (RBC). Instructions: For Contract Year 2022, CCOs that exceed minimum financial requirements have a formula-driven minimum SHARE Initiative obligation in compliance with statute and the rules referenced above. CCOs should complete the yellow boxes below to determine their minimum SHARE Initiative obligation. CCOs should then designate a final SHARE Initiative obligation no less than the calculated minimum. SHARE Initiative Parameters: RBC level above which SHARE applies: 300% RBC level for top SHARE rate: 500% Top rate: 20% Dividend match ratio the following: before SHARE Annual pre-tax net income for OHP, CAK, and CAP lines of business before SHARE obligation: 8,118,135 $ 6,778,556 $ 26,996,941 $ Three-year average net income: 13,964,544 $ Calculated SHARE obligation based on net income and RBC level: 2,592,783 (a) Recorded dividend distribution during the year - excluding tax distributions: - $ Pre-tax net income of capitated affiliates (from Exhibit L SE): Subtotal: 0 Calculated SHARE obligation based on dividend match: 0(b) Minimum SHARE Initiative obligation: 2,592,783 the greater of (a) and (b) 2023 CCO SHARE Initiative obligation: 2,702,893 no less than Minimum SHARE obligation above Ok The determination and reporting of their SHARE contribution for the year-end Exhibit L report, due 4/30 should be consistent with the methodology used for other accounting estimates. However, the amount reported by 6/30 to the program on L6.7 and L6.71 needs to be the amount of the actual SHARE Contribution for the reporting period. Any adjustment made between the 4/30 report and the 6/30 report will need to be reflected in the financial reporting at the determination of each individual CCO.REPORT L6.71 -- SHARE INITIATIVE PAYMENT BREAKDOWN (YEAR-BY-YEAR) (SHARE = Supporting Health for All through REinvestment) CONTRACTOR: Allcare CCO CALENDAR YEAR: 1/1/2022 - 12/31/2022 Purpose: To track year-over-year spending from a CCO's SHARE Initiative and to tie such spending to the appropriate SHARE Initiative Designation Year (i.e. the year in which OHA approved the Spending Plan associated with the spent funds). Instructions: Completed annually and submitted with the audited fourth quarter reporting package due June 30. CCO updates report with each SHARE Initiative designation as identified in tab L6.7. CCO includes total spending for each calendar year in yellow fields beginning with 2021, with spending associated to the appropriate SHARE Initiative Designation Year as approved in a CCO's SHARE Initiative Spending Plan. Please note: According to contract requirements, a CCO's annual SHARE Initiative designation must be spent down within three years of OHA's approval of the same year's SHARE Initiative Spending Plan [Exhibit K, Sec 8 b. (5)]. FOR EXAMPLE: A CCO designates $1 million for its 2023 SHARE Initiative designation and reports this figure to OHA using Report L6.7 by June 30, 2023. The CCO then submits their associated Spending Plan to OHA by December 31, 2023. OHA approves the CCO's 2023 SHARE Initiative Spending Plan within 30 days, by January 30, 2024. Subsequently, the CCO must spend down the identified $1 million by January 30, 2027. Each year, as the CCO adds funds to its SHARE Initiative designation, the funds must be spent within three years from the date of OHA approval for each Spending Plan.
