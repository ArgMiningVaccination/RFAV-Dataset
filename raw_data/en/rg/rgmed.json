{"title": "Scapular Spine Stress Fracture Following Reverse Total Shoulder Arthroplasty: Successful Management with Low-Intensity Pulsed Ultrasound", "author": "Esther Wright; Quen Tang; Edward Ibrahim", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "Scapular spine stress fractures are a rare but well-recognised complication following reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA). They present a challenge with no consensus on management. Both operative fixation and conservative measures are associated with high rates of mal- or non-union and decreased functional outcomes. We present the case of a 60-year-old female, who presented with a scapular spine fracture one year following RTSA. Treatment consisted of initial immobilisation, physiotherapy and the application of a portable low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) system (EXOGEN\u00d2 Ultrasound Bone Healing System, Bioventus, Durham NC, Netherlands). Following a three-month treatment course, there was a significant improvement in patient-reported pain and functional scores (Oxford Shoulder Score from 5/48 to 38/48). Sequential radiographic imaging confirmed fracture union. Clinicians may consider the use of LIPUS therapy as a potential adjunctive treatment modality to promote the union of scapular spine stress fractures following RTSA.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2020-10-16", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
