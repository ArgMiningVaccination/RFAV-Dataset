of culturally se nsitive care has progressed immensely in the last few decades. The theory of en culturation has proven that promoting cultural identity and cultural humility improve the health of indigenous communities. This project incorporates cases, themes and practices th at are useful in the integration of traditional medicine (TM) with biomedical (BioM) services. Thi s project was tailored for the clients of the Chief Andrew Isaac Health Center (CAIHC) in Fairban ks, Alaska, but has implications for any healthcare system working with tribal/indigenous gr oups. The CAIHC has been operated by the Tanana Chiefs Co nference for nearly three decades. Despite being a tribally owned clinic, the CAIHC uses a prototypical approach to clinic organization and management. Recently some of the p rinciple stakeholders have become interested in the possibility of incorporating a mo re holistic, traditional approach. The question to answer is: How do you successfully and sustainably integrate TM with BioM in the context of evidence based practice and cultu ral humility and how can those principles be applied to the Chief Andrew Isaac Health Center? The objectives of this project include: Completing a clinical rotation at the CAIHC in Fair banks, Alaska Recruit content experts to assist in refining the p roject in an ongoing fashion. Develop a manuscript on the subject of integrative models suitable for submission for peer review Develop a poster that summarizes the key points of the manuscript. Develop a formal presentation with specific princip les and recommendations for the Tanana Chiefs Conference, to be presented in Fairba nks Alaska. This paper is not an exploration of the common prac tices known as Complementary and Alternative medicine (CAM) where traditional healin g practices and philosophies are brought into western medical clinics for non-indigenous peo ples. The theme of this paper does not question the validity of that model but I suggest t hat there is something different at work in the context of enculturation and the use of medicine as promoting cultural continuity and identity. . The objectives of this project are specifically d irected, and the end result of this project will be applied to the Tanana Chiefs Conference in Fairb anks Alaska as a means to improve the healthcare they are providing to their people. This project was approved by Dr. Dianne Fuller, dir ector of the Nurse Practitioner, Primary Care Program and chaired by Dr. Tamara Melville of the University of Utah, College of Nursing. The content experts consulted during the course of this project include Dr. Peter DeSchweinitz from the University of Utah, School of Medicine and the Chief Andrew Isaac Health Center, Fairbanks Alaska; Dr. John Lowe, Wymer Distinguishe d professor, Florida Atlantic University; and Dr. Georgia Kyba, of the First Nations Health C ouncil, British Columbia. INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 6 Introduction In 2006, while traveling in Ecuador with a medical expedition, I fell in with an interpreter who had a keen interest in medical anthropology. Du ring the course of our work we found a small clinic in the mountain region of Ecuador, Imb abura province. Nestled there, in the city of Otovalo is the Jambi Huasi clinic. While there we m et a biomedically trained M.D., and a Fregadora (folk healer). Dr. Conejo, the MD, also t old me about their Yachac (medicine man). Dr. Conejo told us about their pharmacy and herbari um as well as the dental clinic they operate. She described their clinical laboratory ability as well. Jambi Huasi is run as a highly integrated, successful, self-sustaining clinic that meets the c ultural and medical needs of the Kichwa, Mestizo, and Afroecuatoriano population in Otavalo (Conejo, 2009). It is an enviable blend of culture care and medicine. In 2010 I did an in-depth literature review and fo und no indication of a similar model in North America. Networking throughout 2011 and 2012 produced leads on a small number of clinics including one in Anchorage, AK and another in Pi\u00f1on, AZ - in the Navajo Nation. Although it is likely there are more clinics operat ing in some integrated fashion they are difficult to locate as there is no formalized network and man y hold the proprietary nature of their integration very close. In 2012 I had the opportunity as part of my trainin g to spend five weeks on rotation at the Chief Andrew Isaac Health Center (CAIHC), a triball y owned clinic held by the Tanana Chiefs Conference (TCC), in Fairbanks, Alaska. Despite a l arge amount of cultural pride in the population served by this health center there was n o significant, formal integration of cultural values and traditional practices into the clinic se tting. Evidence in the literature supports INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 7 promotion of cultural identity as a strong health-r isk modifier and yet it was lacking in the interface of medicine and community for this group. Purpose The purpose of this project is to understand models of integration between traditional healers and biomedically grounded providers that ha ve been described in the literature, and apply it to the CAIHC in Fairbanks. With that in mind the question I want to answer is: How do you successfully and sustainably integrate traditional medicine with biomedicine in the context of evidence based practice and principles of cultural humility The original title of this project used the word in tegration instead of harmonization. Historically harmonization has been synonymous with consensus building, or mediation. The term integration has been used as a euphemism for a ssimilation, especially as associated with 1940s era policies to 'improve' living conditions o f indigenous populations by assimilating or integrating them into the 'national society' (PAHO/ WHO, 2002). Throughout this paper the word integration and harmonization are used interch angeably in the hope that we can see our way to a respectful and culturally humble approach in bringing the best health outcomes to tribal communities. Problem The Chief Andrew Isaac Health Center (CAIHC) has be en operated by the Tanana Chiefs Conference for nearly three decades. Despite being a tribally owned clinic the CAIHC uses a prototypical approach to clinic organization and ma nagement. Recently some of the principle stakeholders have become interested in the possibil ity of incorporating a more holistic, traditional approach. INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 8 Significance Global Significance Cultural perspectives in healthcare have experience d increased recognition during the past two to three decades. With increased awareness has come improved models of culture care. Newer models of culturally sensitive care are cente red on the principle of Cultural Humility. Cultural Humility recognizes that culturally-congru ent care is most effective as a mode of collaboration. This departs from the classic paradi gm of cultural sensitivity where it was considered sufficient for health care providers to possess a list of facts about a culture (Tervalon & Murray-Garcia, 1998). This shift is important relative to the protective nature of enculturation in ethnic communities and the role that traditional practices play in promoting cultural identity (Winderowd, Montgomery, Stumblingbear, Harless, & H icks, 2008). By integrating traditional practices using proven methods of collaboration the quality of health care in and the strength of the Native community can be significantly strengthe ned(Jones & Galliher, 2007; Winderowd et al., 2008). Integrating traditional medicine has th e additional benefit of improving access to care by promoting health-seeking behaviors in traditiona lly rooted populations. When communities validate traditional medicine and cultural values a s part of a holistic environment of healing, more individuals from the community are likely to s eek care and adhere to treatments (Mignone, Bartlett, O'Neil, & Orchard, 2007; Novins et al., 2 004). Efforts to eliminate health disparity such as the H ealthy People initiatives look at different means to this end. Traditional medicine i s one area that needs to be focused on when trying to meet these goals(Struthers, Eschiti, & Pa tchell, 2004). The Pan American Health INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 9 Organization(PAHO) has discussed what an end to hea lth disparity might look like and describe equity in terms of certain requirements. In the context of health conditions, equity means r educing avoidable and unjust differences to the minimum level possible. Equity i n health services means receiving care according to need and contributing economically acc ording to the ability to pay. (PAHO/WHO, 2002). Both of these ideas can be fostered in the c ontext of traditional medicine which is often low-cost relative to biomedical services. Ultimatel y traditional medicine could become a critical resource in addressing global health disparities (B urke, Wong, & Clayson, 2003). Encouraging traditional healing may be one way to achieve this (Struthers et al., 2004). Significance for the TCC The TCC provides health care for nearly 11,000 Alas ka Natives in the Fairbanks region. This is an area of 235,000 square miles - roughly t hree quarters the size of the state of Texas. The Chief Andrew Isaac Health Center (CAIHC), affil iated satellite clinics, and other outreach programs have been run by the TCC for nearly three decades. During that time they have sought to \"promote and enhance spiritual, physical, mental and emotional wellness through the delivery of quality services\" (Tanana Chiefs Conference, Inc ., n.d.). Despite being a tribally owned clinic the CAIHC uses a prototypical approach to clinic or ganization and management. In early 2012 the TCC entered into a joint project with the India n Health Services (IHS) to build a new 'Super Clinic' to house the CAIHC. Until they relocated to the new clinic space at the end of 2012 the CAIHC operated out of leased space at Fairbanks Mem orial Hospital. This facility upgrade provides an ideal opportunit y to expand the healing modalities offered through CAIHC to the Alaska Natives of the TCC region (Erickson, 2009; Tanana Chiefs Conference, Inc., n.d.) To date, cultural and tradi tional medicine practices have not been closely INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 10 integrated into the delivery of healthcare. With th e advent of a community based suicide prevention program in 2011 they have only recently begun to look at specific and concrete ways to promote culture care in the context of healthcar e delivery. Objectives Completion of a clinical rotation at the CAIHC in F airbanks, Alaska Recruit content experts to assist in refining the p roject in an ongoing fashion. Develop a manuscript on the subject of integrative models suitable for submission for peer review Develop a poster that summarizes the key points of the manuscript. Develop a formal presentation with specific princip les and recommendations for the Tanana Chiefs Conference, to be presented in Fairbanks Ala ska. DNP Essentials This project is a synthesis of the DNP curriculum. I have identified the key DNP essentials as outlined by the AACN that are taken into considerat ion by this project. I - Scientific underpinnings: Integrate nursing sci ence with knowledge from ethics, the biophysical, psychosocial, analytical, and organiza tional sciences as the basis for the highest level of nursing practice. Develop and evaluate new practice approaches based on nursing theories and theories from other disciplines. II - Organizational and Systems Leadership: Develop and evaluate care delivery approaches that meet current and future needs of patient popul ations based on scientific findings in nursing and other clinical sciences, as well as organizatio nal, political, and economic sciences. III - Clinical Scholarship and Analytical Methods f or Evidence Based Practice: Use analytic methods to critically appraise existing literature and other evidence to determine and implement INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 11 the best evidence for practice. Apply relevant find ings to develop practice guidelines and improve practice and the practice environment. Func tion as a practice specialist/consultant in collaborative knowledge-generating research. Dissem inate findings from evidence-based practice and research to improve healthcare outcomes. VI - Interprofessional Collaboration: Employ effect ive communication and collaborative skills in the development and implementation of pra ctice models. Employ consultative and leadership skills with intraprofessional and interp rofessional teams to create change in health care and complex healthcare delivery systems. VII - Clinical Prevention and Population Health: S ynthesize concepts, including psychosocial dimensions and cultural diversity. Eva luate care delivery models and/or strategies using concepts related to community, and cultural d imensions of health. VIII - Advanced Practice Nursing: Educate and guide individuals and groups through complex health and situational transitions. Design, implement, and evaluate therapeutic interventions based on nursing science and other sc iences (AACN, 2006). Literature Search Strategy In order to understand the implications of bringing biomedical healthcare models together with traditional healing practices a review of the literature was conducted. Particular emphasis was placed on informing a validation of this model of care and locating previously published works that described specific instances of collabor ative efforts i.e. case studies; as well as any potential difficulties and how they might be surmou nted. The Mesh terms 'traditional medicine' and 'integrat ive medicine' were used alone and following strings: (\"traditional medicin e\" OR \"spiritual therapies\") AND (allopath* INTEGRATING HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 12 OR Biomed* OR Western OR Modern) and (\"Spiritual Th erapies\"[Mesh] OR \"Medicine, Traditional\"[Mesh]) AND \"Integrative Medicine\"[Mesh ]. Some additional terms were used in combination inc luding: Native American, Alaska Native, tribal, culture, cultural, enculturation, i dentity, and maintenance. Inclusion criteria are any article published in the last 10 years regardin g traditional medicine and its relationship to cultural identity as well as the relationship betwe en cultural identity and health risk behaviors. Also included without restriction to time are any d escriptive studies of specific models or incidents of integrative health clinics. The search was conducted in CINAHL, Medline and Pub Med using the strings and direct key word searches noted above as well as searches f or known cases in the literature. Additional search strategies include author-as-keyword using a cademics and clinicians known to be involved in this field as well as ancestry methods of bibliographic review. Searches using strings and key words similar to those above were done in G oogle Scholar to identify pertinent grey literature. Review of the Literature Although this project draws influence from various theoretical and philosophical foundations including Madeleine Leininger's Culture Care theory and the principles of Cultural Humility; by far the main theoretical underpinning is that of Enculturation theory. Discussions of culturally appropriate care often u se the terms assimilation and acculturation in reference to the effects observed when minority cultures are surrounded by a dominant one. These terms describe the fairly expec ted outcomes of typical scenarios: dilution and or loss of cultural identity along with the ado ption of the dominant-culture symbol and behavioral constructs. One of the first formal disc ussions of acculturation is found in a brief INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 13 paper from 1936 by Redfield, Linton and Herskovits. At that time the term acculturation had a fairly general definition: \"Acculturation comprehen ds those phenomena which result when groups of individuals sharing different cultures co me into continuous first-hand contact, with subsequent changes in the original culture patterns of either or both groups\"(p. 149). Over time this definition has been broken down into more nuanced descriptions of the patterns of knowledge/behavior distribution and sha ring associated with cultural interactions. The term diffusion is the most general term merely indicating a spread of cultural elements. Acculturation has come to reference the changes tha t one experiences due to the influence of being in contact with another culture. Specifically , changes to attitudes, values and identity (Kim, Ahn, & Lam, 2009). Although initially conside red equivalent to or a subset of acculturation, enculturation shows up as a distinct set of phenomena in the 1948 book Man and His Works: The Science of Cultural Anthropology by Melville Herskovitz. In this work Herskovitz suggested that enculturation is \"the pro cess of socialization into and maintenance of the norms of one's indigenous culture including its salient ideas, concepts and values\" (Kim et al., 2009, p. 26). This is the definition that has driven the development of enculturation scales to measure levels of enculturation and the subsequent large numbers of studies that have explored the effects that various levels of enculturation mi ght have on health and health-risk behaviors in many different ethnic groups. In the American Indian/Alaska Native population enc ulturation has been demonstrated to be protective in nature. Affiliation with tradition al ways promotes resilience in the face of adverse life conditions (Winderowd et al., 2008). A lthough a successful model as demonstrated by exploration of the theory and a review of isolat ed case studies, during preliminary searches a comprehensive review on the subject of integrative models could not be identified. INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 14 This project seeks to utilize the benefits of stron g tribal affiliation by applying it directly into the healthcare service model via the integrati on of traditional, culturally congruent, healing methods as an additional way to promote enculturati on. A review of the literature will be used to inform this project and the objectives listed below in order to synthesize information from any models currently operating and identify common them es, methods, and theories that can be used to build a tailored and sustainable model of integr ation for the TCC. Methods Implementation of Objectives Clinic rotation. In order to have a better understanding of the pat ient population and culture of healthcare within the TCC I was invited to spend a portion of the summer semester 2012 working at the CAIHC. To accomplish this I exp lored options for funding via local philanthropic foundations, applied for a grant thro ugh the Utah Nurse Practitioners Association (UNP) and applied for the preceptorship through the TCC and the Alaska Interior Area Health Education Council (AHEC). Content experts. Content experts were sought out during the review of the literature as well as via networking through the College of nursi ng, the CAIHC and professional connections. Literature review. The literature review was pursued as outlined above over the course of approximately 2 years with varying degrees of in tensity. The search strings and terms used were refined over that time period with the greates t amount of literature identified during the Summer and Fall of 2012. Manuscript. I identified the Journal of Transcultural Nursing ( JTCN) as an ideal prospect for submitting the manuscript for peer rev iew. This appears to be a good fit for my topic INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 15 and the JTCN has a preferred submission style of AP A which suggests less worry about learning a new style of citation and reference at this time. Poster. As part of the College of Nursing requirements for this project I developed a poster that summarized the key points of the manusc ript. Poster presentations were held on campus the third week of April 2013. Presentation. I worked with the content experts, especially Dr. d e Schweinitz to synthesize the information gleaned during my litera ture review into specific recommendations for the TCC and CAIHC. This was done in a PowerPoin t presentation. Results Evaluation of Objectives Clinic rotation. After successfully obtaining funding via the groups noted above I commenced with the actual rotation at CAIHC. Evalua tion of the clinical rotation objective takes into consideration the quality of the rotation itse lf. I spent a total of 5 weeks under the preceptorship of Dr. Peter de Schweinitz from the U niversity Of Utah, College Of Medicine. While clinical rotations are designed to enhance th e synthesis and application of clinical knowledge, I had the additional goal at CAIHC to un derstand something of the culture of healthcare within the TCC. Although it was a cursor y introduction; I was able to see the environment at CAIHC in Fairbanks as well as travel out to a more remote clinic that served some isolated villages and get a feel for some of t he unique challenges of that aspect of the healthcare operations. I was able to work directly with the staff of the clinic and meet a representative selection of the client base served by the TCC. I had hoped to be able to identify at least one traditional healer during my time there b ut was met with difficulty as not only was there no knowledge of any practicing traditional he alers, I could find no-one with first hand INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 16 memory of a traditional healer operating within the TCC region with the exception of an elder woman from a remote village who recollected someone from the village practicing what amounted to witchcraft or dark medicine and driving people out of the village. This was, per her memory, as recent as the mid-1990s. Content experts. Content expert (CE) recruitment was successful with the recruitment of not two but three CEs. Dr. Peter de Schweinitz is a Family Practice physician and Director of Health Integration and Development at Chief Andrew Isaac Health Center. Dr. John Lowe is a PhD prepared RN from the Cherokee Nation who teache s at Florida Atlantic University and has extensive experience developing substance abuse pre vention programs based on traditional tribal values. The third content expert is Dr. Georgia Kyb a, Naturopathic Doctor and Advisor to the First Nations Health Council, British Colombia, Can ada. I was able to meet with Dr. Lowe in person at the outset of my project and received som e good insight and direction from him. Dr. Kyba gave feedback on manuscript drafts and suggest ed some additional resources to incorporate in the future as I pursue this project post-graduat ion. I had excellent input from Dr. de Schweinitz though this is not particularly surprisi ng. Dr. de Schweinitz has some personal investment in the outcome of this project as he is one of the advocates for an integrated medicine program at CAIHC. Literature review . The literature review totaled forty-five pages incl uding review of topics pertinent to the theoretical underpinning an d background information. A total of twenty- five pages of information were developed that direc tly answered the inquiry of this project including a review of case studies. Themes that con tribute additional information were also identified. Some desired articles identified in the searches were unable to be obtained within the time constraints of the project timeline. However, repetition of themes began to be apparent, with INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 17 Table 1: Project Implementation and evaluation summ ary Objectives Implementation Status Evaluation CAIHC clinical rotation Completed Successful including obtaining funding, not able to identify TCC affiliated tribal healer as hoped.

Presentation Completed using PowerPoint Travel to Fairbanks in August of 2013 to present Presentation complete Travel plans arranged INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 18 the articles that were readily accessible. There wa s some concern as to whether case studies from different parts of the world could inform any kind of unified model. While the literature demonstrates a wide cultural variety in TM treatmen t models there was sufficient congruency in worldview across different TM paradigms to warrant the use of any case studies found. A copy of the literature review is attached in appendix A. Manuscript. The literature review was condensed down to meet th e requirements of the JTCN. It was quite challenging to reduce the litera ture review into the 17 page limit set by the JTCN but it helped to focus the findings of the rev iew into a more accessible format. A copy of the manuscript can be found in appendix B. Poster. It was difficult to summarize such qualitative work when poster presentations lend themselves best to graphical representations o f data driven work. However, I believe I was able to achieve a reasonable level of content repor ting and aesthetic based on the manuscript. This leaves the poster general enough that I will b e able to use it at other poster presentations in the future. A copy of the poster can be found in Ap pendix C. Presentation . Initially I had planned to have the presentation re ady by March but soon realized that I needed the benefit of condensing th e information from the literature review into manuscript and poster format in order to identify t he most pertinent information possible. A meeting with the medical staff and the executive bo ard of the TCC is scheduled for August of 2013. The slide outline of the presentation can be seen in appendix C. Recommendations Practical advice from the case studies is demonstra ted with good recurrence of themes consistent across the case studies and in accordanc e with recommendations from the WHO and PAHO. Key principles involve Communication, environ mental considerations, Attitudes of INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 19 employees, qualifications of TM providers, and stra tegies for reconciliation of EBP with evidence from tradition and cultural humility. Communication Communication issues encompass communication regard ing referrals and interdisciplinary treatment plans. Communication be tween TM and BoM providers needs to be open in order to promote collaboration. Setting up standardized documentation formats is one method of promoting this as is offering education o n interdisciplinary communication. Referrals between providers would be enhanced with communicat ion that both were able to understand and apply to their setting. Referrals into the serv ice lines have been provided in two ways: self- referral or PCP referral. Both options were seen in cases and both were successful. Consideration of cultural and logistical needs regarding funding and reimbursement would likely promote one mode over the other. It did seem that self-referral tends to lead to more compartmentalization of therapies i.e. certain illness being treated by one modality and other illness by the other at the preference of the clients although this was certain ly not only a feature of self-referral. Environmental Concerns Promoting an environment that is culturally appropr iate was demonstrated to be a key part of successful integration across multiple clin ics. Environmental concerns included geographic, designation of spaces and aesthetic con siderations. Organization of clinic space, orientation of buildings and rooms to the cardinal direction, having a place for TM set aside with its own aesthetic and promoting an environment that facilitates a culturally oriented provider/client interaction were all key elements d emonstrated in the cases. INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 20 Attitudes Toward TM Successful employee education initiatives were note d to be crucial to promoting a respect for TM. Acknowledging and promoting TM is one of th e key recommendations from the WHO. St. Mary's and SCF both accomplished this through s eries of seminars and workshops which emphasize respect for the ideas behind TM rather th an trying to teach the mechanics of TM. This approach makes the most sense in the context of cli nic employees who may not share the cultural background of the tribal group they are working wit h. Qualifying TM Providers This is probably one of the most important consider ations with the least amount of information available. Tribal elders should play a consistent role in qualifying healers but beyond that the WHO recommends that a standardized qualifi cations for TM healers should be considered. Further information could certainly be gleaned from SCF as to the process that they followed although the specifics could not be found in the literature. One beneficial feature of new IHS funding guidelines is that Naturopathic Doc tors are eligible to bill for services provided in direct care and will now be eligible for loan re payment if hired on at a qualified clinic (Indian Health Services, n.d.a; Roubideaux, 2012). ND will still not be reimbursed for contract-health work (Indian Health Services, n.d.b), but the congr uency of philosophy between many tribal cultures and Naturopathic medicine may make this a good starting place for finding a central, supervising provider for the TM branch of an integr ated clinic (Fleming & Gutknecht, 2010). Reconciling EBP with Evidence from Tradition While historical trauma, discussed at length in the literature review, may function as a significant barrier to harmonization; by and far th e greatest concerns are those mounted in defense of EBP and the randomized controlled trial as the gold standard for all approaches to INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 21 healthcare. While EBP has provided significant impr ovements in the treatment of many illnesses the literature supports the idea for an alternative , reasonable standard of measuring efficacy and effectiveness of treatment for traditional medicine practices. Mignone et al. (2007) whose case studies were the most comprehensive, suggest that b est practice treatments should satisfy thirteen criteria. Seven of these seem particularly relevant to TM treatments and the EBP paradigm. They should: have a positive impact; be sustainable; be relevant to patient, community, culture and environment; be client focused; improve access; hav e potential for replication; and have capacity for evaluation. These principles represent a reason able approach that fits with the WHO standards for healthcare organizations and the impo rtance of validating TM. Conclusion As evidenced by the content of the review, informat ion on contemporary practice of traditional AI/AN is scarce; even knowing the names of some clinics that have experimented with various levels of integration led to minimal d escriptive information during the course of the literature search. Factors that have contributed to this over the years are fear of ridicule and concern about misuse or co-optation of the informat ion. Healing is often considered a private matter, and even a sacred process. (Struthers et al ., 2004). While there are some demonstrable challenges to dev eloping a harmonized clinic model; by acknowledging the cultural variations of TM and BioM we can tap into the validation of culture as a way to overcome past patterns of colon ization, cooptation and appropriation. To succeed at integrative efforts we must accept and r espect the differences inherent in each system while understanding that health is not just physica l fitness (Conejo, 2009). INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 22 Tina Melin, a provider from Kotezebue, Alaska said it best: The people of this region wish to put their heads a nd hearts together with guidance from our creator to attempt to get to the root of the ca use or suffering... they have their own legitimate ways of knowing how to do this. Those of us who are a part of the health care system need to work together with them... They wish t o remember the healthy ways of the days of old blended in with the new... they wish to regain and strengthen their cultural identity and pride. They wish to help them selves and each other to get on that path to health and stay there (Morgan, 2009, p. 89) At this time perhaps more than any other previously we are in a place that recognizes the need for a holistic approach within BioM models of care. Increasingly this holistic element in BioM is in alignment with TM principles meaning tha t these challenges should not be considered insurmountable and efforts like those seen at Jambi Huasi and the Southcentral clinic are within the grasp of any clinic desiring to improve culture care to their clients.

Traditional medicine is a comprehensive term used t o refer broadly to systems like Chinese medicine and the Indian tradition of Ayurve da as well as others that are rooted in indigenous cultures. An indigenous person is someon e who self-defines as indigenous or tribal. These are peoples, communities, and nations that ha ve historical continuity with a pre- invasion/pre-colonial society (Struthers et al., 20 04; WHO, 2005). It is important to recognize that traditional medic ine has been making contributions to the health of communities since long before the develop ment and spread of the 'western' medicine that originated in Europe subsequent to the develop ment of modern science and technology (Bruce, 2002; Zhang, 2000). Traditional medicine is not \"embryonic modern medicine or a predecessor to advanced modern medicine... [it] is an entirely different entity\"(Struthers et al., 2004, p. 142). Although many cultures have an historical medicine tradition there should be some caution about assuming that there is a globally hom ogenous 'traditional medicine' body of thought and practice. Lumping together everything t hat is \"not ours\" i.e., not biomedical is extremely ethnocentric and can lead to gross genera lizations (van der Geest, 1997). Traditional medicine covers a wide variety of therapies and pra ctices which may vary greatly from country to country and from region to region. The kinds of therapies seen in these traditional medicine or traditional healing modalities can include the use of medication if that medication comprises herbal preparations, or medicines derived from vari ous mineral and animal sources; as well as INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 30 non-medication therapies such as acupuncture, manua l therapies and spiritual therapies (WHO, 2005, 2009). Despite this lack of homogeneity, there are some un ifying themes that are useful to understand especially in the context of this projec t as we look around the world at various models of harmonization that have been implemented or principles that have been observed. In this context it is useful to know whether these ide as are reflective of a congruency in world-view and therefore potentially more or less useful as po ints of reference (van der Geest, 1997). Traditional medicine paradigms around the world ope rate in an indigenous spiritual realm that is very different from biomedicine which has its roots in Cartesian dualism (Bruce, 2002; Struthers et al., 2004). There is a religious dimension to th e medical reasoning of traditional tribal medicine. In this world we are too much in the physical world . You know, we have an operation that physically heals. When we have any kind of inj ury to our body, we have to know our spirit, our heart and our emotions are also affecte d. That physical scar, or whatever surgery we have, heals. That inside part, does not it require [its own] treatment?... So healing comes with a soul wound and the solace requ ires a different way. We have to find [the wounds] because the physical, emotional, spiri tual - they all have to heal (Dolchok, 2003, pp. 20, 22). In light of this the perspective utilized in concep tualizing health and wellness within indigenous health systems go well beyond convention al reductionist paradigms and hold unique knowledge and insights that are different from the biomedical models (PAHO/WHO, 2002). Keeping the concept of Cultural Humility in mind th ere is significant possibility of mutual enrichment (van der Geest, 1997). INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 31 For the indigenous people of the world health and illness are typically more comprehensive notions than we conceptualize in west ern society. Some languages don't even have a single word translation for the English word 'health' as it is too complex an idea to be rendered in a single locution. For most it is holis tic in the greatest sense of the word (van der Geest, 1997). \"The concept of health is not limited to the absence of pain or illness, but the harmony and the internal balance of the person in t he family, the community, the nature and the cosmos\" (Jambi Huasi, 2005). This idea aligns with the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of health that has developed increasing favor in biomedical circles. The WHO definition describes health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being not merely the absence of disease or infirmity (PAHO/WH O, 2002; van der Geest, 1997) . This idea of complete health, inclusive of social w ell-being, puts an orientation towards the community as participants of individual and gro up health as well as towards prevention. The emphasis on the community and family brings a socia l character to traditional medicine. Disorder in the community ultimately leads to disor der in the health condition of its members. An illness of one family member is seen as an illne ss of the entire family. Any solution to the problem is the responsibility of the entire group ( Eby, 1998; van der Geest, 1997). Ideas of prevention come from a concentration on th e deeper origins of illness. Once identified, it is not acceptable to ignore them. So mething should be done about the root cause of the illness in order to have a healthy life and avo id a repetition of the misfortune or illness in the future. The concepts of prevention and community ar e linked in the idea that the origins of illness, the treatment of illness and the preventio n of illness are all linked to the quality of human relationships (van der Geest, 1997; Weil, 2011). INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 32 One of the key unifying constructs of historical an d cultural medicine traditions is the lifelong nature of the pursuit of health. \"To benefit from I ndian medicine power one has to possess conviction and feeling in it and be involved in tha t particular way of life\"(Struthers et al., 2004, p. 143) ultimately what makes traditional healing i s the history of the tradition and the endurance of practice through time (Wing, 1998). This differs from the ideas of western utilization of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) which may share common ground in reliance on herbal or spiritual remedies but at the end of t he day it is a comprehensive way of living, a way of viewing the world the way that your ancestor s viewed the world, \"not something we take off a shelf when it's convenient and then put it ba ck when we are done\" (Lowe, 2012). Comparing Systems of Traditional Healing With the B iomedical Model If looking at the unifying themes across traditiona l medicine practices is useful, knowing how traditional medicine and biomedical services co mpare is also pertinent to the discussion (Morgan, 2009). Sociologists and anthropologists u se a culture's healing traditions as a way to understand that culture. We appreciate then, that h ealth belief is a key measure of the core principles of a society. Trying to bring together t wo biased systems is challenging and involves comparing the setting, the paradigm of healing know ledge, the social implications of being or seeking out a healer, and the costs associated. (Eb y, 1998) The practice setting of biomedicine is essentially institutional; it takes place in formal spaces set aside specifically for the practice of m edicine. This differs from the typical setting of the traditional practitioner who more often will tr eat in the community setting often with direct involvement of family members(Bruce, 2002; Morgan, 2009). For many traditional healers medical knowledge is considered personal property, there are even further implication of the proprietary nature of traditional healing that are discussed further on in this paper. This differs INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 33 from western society where biomedical knowledge, t he science that drives medical treatment and decision making, is considered public (van der Geest, 1997). One only need look to the proliferation of biomedically oriented websites and public domain presentations on the internet to see evidence of this. Within many traditional societies the social contex t of a therapeutic action on the part of a healer requires reciprocity from the recipient as a sign of respect and appreciation. If no payment is made there is an implication that there is no obligation to the healer. If no appreciation is shown it implies that there is no r elationship and in the context of a worldview that typically emphasizes the interrelatedness of a ll things you run risk of negating the medicine and falling ill again if the respect and appreciati on are absent. Alternatively, until relatively recently biomedicine in most traditional communitie s was a socialized program, given away essentially for free (van der Geest, 1997). Table A1: Comparison of Traditional Medicine with B iomedical Models Traditional Cultural Healing Pathways Biomedicine/A llopathy Mind, body, spirit - holistic approach Reductionist approach Tribal beliefs of health and illness used with physical, social and spiritual information to make diagnosis Patient centered history and physical along with biochemical, physiologic, anatomic, laboratory based data used to make diagnosis Healer teaches patient to heal self Doctors taught that their interventions do the healing Health and harmony emphasized Disease and curing emphasized Honor patient for restoring wellness Honors physician for curing Herbal medicines may be used Pharmaceuticals (some derived from herbals) may be used Preventative medicine taught Preventative medicine taught Adapted from: Struthers et al., 2004, p. 147 There are some commonalities between traditional me dicine and biomedical healthcare services though, and it would be a huge disservice to ignore these, especially when trying to bring the two together in a collaborative effort. B oth models of care have a perspective of INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 34 prevention and a desire to protect against diseases and health problems. Both models also have (within their paradigm) a desire to determine the c ause of the disease, and promote health by eliminating the problem (Bruce, 2002). Case Studies In a series of case studies Mignone, Bartlett, O'Ne il, & Orchard (2007) describe some of the efforts at collaborative healthcare in various countries in South America. Additional case studies identified through the literature search ar e also described. Kwamalasamutu, Suriname The southern Suriname village of Kwamalasamutu whic h is located in the interior amazon basin has two clinics, one provides western , biomedical services and is operated by a local non-government organization (NGO) with primar ily govt. funding. The other clinic, a traditional indigenous medicine clinic is operated by elder tribal shamans and is financed by the Amazon Conservation Team a U.S. based NGO. The choi ce to be treated in either clinic is entirely elective and is left up to the individual client (Mignone et al., 2007). Individuals from both clinics: shamans, medical mis sion health workers, and physicians lead workshops to raise awareness about traditional heal th, medicinal plants and indigenous concepts of health and illness. The providers from the biome dical clinic also offer training to the traditional healers on basic primary care issues an d preventative health practices. Referrals are routinely made between the two clinics (Mignone et al., 2007). The indigenous medicine clinic hosts a Shaman's app rentice program to preserve traditional knowledge. However, an interesting part of the trai ning for new apprentices is in filling out health and treatment record forms that are used to document the conditions and ongoing treatments provided to the clients by the Shaman. (Mignone et al., 2007). INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 35 Comadronas in Guatemala In San Juan de Comalapa a city with a population o f around 36k Comadronas provide midwifery care to 85% of pregnant mothers within th e Mayan community. Comadronas are responsible for assisting with pregnancy/childbirth and for offering spiritual guidance to mothers and families. Their scope of practice also include s the administering of spiritual and empirical treatments to infant with cultural illness such as susto (soul fright) and mal de ojo (the evil eye). This case study is less about integration in a spec ifc setting and more about the integration of Comadronas in general with the healthcare system. A government sponsored training program to improve the quality of care provided by the Comadronas was implemented. The program consists of a one week program in pre-natal care and recognition of complications associated with pr egnancy. Completion of the course certifies the Comadronas to register births and serves as a d e-facto license to practice. Certifying a live birth and registering the newborn is an important f unction although the lack of this license has not been noted as a deterrent to those Comadronas w ho opt not to participate in the training (Mignone et al., 2007). Temuco, Chile Temuco, Chile has a population approaching 300 thou sand. Healthcare services in the area are provided by one rural, outlying hospital a nd several clinics. In Temuco there is an intercultural program where machi (traditional healer) are offered as an equal/comple mentary alternative to western medicine in each of these he althcare settings. The motivating factor is that of self-determination and as such the program is r un primarily by western-trained Mapuche. The Mapuche are the predominant indigenous culture of t he region. Intercultural health workers are INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 36 on staff at these facilities and operate a referral program to traditional medicine providers when seen fit. Machi care is not actually provided in the hospital but in neighboring Boroa, another Mapuche community center patients have the option o f pursuing treatment with western medications or Machi herbals or both.(Mignone et al ., 2007). Jambi Huasi - Ecuador In the mountain town of Otovalo, population thirty- thousand, Jambi Huasi offers a full range of western and indigenous health services. Th e operate on a fee for service basis, offering care to the ethnic groups of Kichwa, mestizos (bira cial group descended from indigenous and conquistadores) and Afroecuatorianos (Conejo, 2009) . The clinic offerings include two biomedical physici ans, clinical psychology, dentistry, a pharmacy, and a clinical lab as well as the traditi onal indigenous services of a Yachac (medicine man), Fregadora (herbalist/massage therapist) and a Pakarichik mama (midwife). In addition to the offerings of western biomedicine and traditiona l indigenous medicine they also have a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioner on staff. They operate an aggressive, well received health promotion program in order to integ rate systems of knowledge from western and indigenous perspectives. They offer treatment for o rganic diseases, emotional disorders, and energetic diseases (Conejo, 2009; Mignone et al., 2 007). Jambi Huasi operates on mixed funding. Some governm ent and NGO moneys come in but these are insufficient to sustain operations so they also rely on a modest fee-for-service (Mignone et al., 2007). The Ecuadorian Ministry of Public Healt h funds one doctor and one nurse, and the ECU School of Obstetrics funds one OB/GYN. Addition al funding from the Blue Sky Foundation provides for one nurse (Conejo, 2009). INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 37 Jambi Huasi is functionally a western health care o rganization offering intercultural health care services and managed by indigenous enti ty (Mignone et al., 2007). Dr. Conejo, a native Kichwa is bilingual in Kichwa and Castilian. The clinic's goal is to provide health care with co nsideration toward the sociocultural situation and local worldview as well as revaluing the role of indigenous medicine and all Jambigkuna (healthcare workers) by institutionalizi ng Indian and western medicine together. To this end the medical center is located on sacred gr ound and the Clinic is oriented to the four cardinal directions, to promote individual value th e various Jambigkuna were encouraged to select their own offices (Conejo, 2009). South Central Foundation - Anchorage, Alaska Perhaps one of, the best examples of integrative he althcare efforts in North America is that of the South Central Foundation (SCF) in Ancho rage, Alaska. SCF was established in 1982 as a 501c(3) and obtained its first self-management contract under Public Law 93-638, the Indian Self-Determination Act in 1985. The years 1987 - 19 94 expanded offerings to include dental and optometry services as well as behavioral health ser vices. SCF assumed management of the primary care system for the region in 1998 and owne rship of the Alaska Native Medical Center in 1999. They serve a population of AI/AN which app roaches 58,000 individuals; these are referred to as 'customer-owners'. They operate more than sixty five different programs (Mala, Dolchock, & Daney, 2011). One of these is the Tradi tional Healing Clinic which has been described as the \"most integrated program of tradit ional tribal and modern medicine in all of North America\" (Daney, 2012). In 2010 the Traditional healing clinic received 107 4 referrals (Mala et al., 2011). This is important as access to the Traditional Healing cli nic is only available via referral from primary INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 38 care providers (PCP) (Barber, 2011; Daney, 2012). C hronic pain is the leading diagnosis referred in at just over 50%. Counseling, acute and chronic pain, smoking cessation and other medical concerns account for eighty-six percent of the refe rrals from the primary care providers of SCF. The traditional healers that work in the clinic are 'tribal doctors' that are certified in traditional native medicine as well as according to criteria th at includes approval from the SCF traditional healing Committee of Elder Advisors. (Benson, 2003; Mala et al., 2011; Morgan, 2009). The tribal doctors have had remarkable success in t reating chronic pain, chronic fatigue and psychogenic reactions using approaches like ene rgy healing, massage, body manipulation and spiritual support (Benson, 2003; Morgan, 2009). In order to promote a collaborative practice environment the practitioners in the Traditional He alth clinic hold regular consultations with PCPs and other practitioners, engage in weekly clin ical rounds with the primary care clinic medical staff, mental health and pediatric clinics. In addition to these in house duties they network and attend to educational opportunities wit h traditional healers from other states and countries (Mala et al., 2011). Key components of the SCF program, which allows suc h close integration with biomedicine and more traditional healing models inc ludes attention to the environment and the implementation of their proprietary model of care c alled Circle of Healing (Benson, 2003; Morgan, 2009). Healthcare operations are provided o n a campus with native d\u00e9cor and art; there is an emphasis on native management; and specific s pace is allocated for traditional tribal medicine, integrative medicine and allopathic (biom edical) medicine. Musical presentations by native performers are frequently present, the Trad itional Healing Clinic opens into a courtyard with a traditional herbal garden (Morgan, 2009). An d an annual gathering/health fair style event INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 39 brings community members together to celebrate thei r native culture, educate about health resources and promote healthy lifestyles (Helvey, 2 010). The care model, Circle of Healing, brings together three modalities: allopathic medicine, alternative medicine and traditional native medicin e. A central person, called a Pathfinder, who is knowledgeable in all three areas meets with the patient to determine needs and health goals, then works with the other disciplines to formulate a wellness plan and help improve health literacy by teaching the customer-owners to access library and internet resources. The Circle of healing incorporates \"prevention, outpatient, inpat ient and after care\" (Benson, 2003) Another key component that promotes the success of the cultural efforts at SCF is the training that goes into the employees. New employees at all SCF facilities attend a three day orientation to learn the SCF expectations and approach to care. Additional training is provided when they attend a 3 day workshop that emphasizes the importa nce of empathy, compassion, and relationship building in promoting the health of th e customer-owners served by SCF (Helvey, 2010). Clalit Health Services - Israel A study by Ben-Arye, Scharf and Frenkel (2007) look ed at communication between biomedical providers and complementary practitioner s employed by Clalit Health Services, a health maintenance organization in Israel with an e xtensive network of biomedical physicians and CAM practitioners. They wanted to understand at titudes and expectations relative to inter disciplinary communications and collaborations. Whi le this literature survey has mostly shied away from CAM oriented integration it is an illumin ating study on the communications between providers across modalities in the same health syst em. INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 40 A low rate of communication between disciplines is a well-established fact. A large majority of the physicians in the U.S. (82% in one survey) indicated that they had a strong referral relationship with other physicians but no formal referral relationship with chiropractors. The majority of providers surveyed by Ben-Arye et a l. were interested in some level of clinical practice collaboration and would be willing to comm unicate, preferably by medical consultation letter to formulate treatment plans. They go on to suggest that formalizing educational modules on communication between disciplines to overcome \"l anguage\" barriers would promote collaboration at least via the consultation letter (Ben-Arye et al., 2007). North Korea - Historical attempts By the beginning of the 20th century much of Asia, under various governmental pressures and influenced by the success of hygiene practices promulgated by germ theory and the success of the smallpox vaccine, had adopted models of western biomedicine (Hong, 2001). Over the next 50 - 75 years though the traditional medicine practitioners had made some sort of come-back and each country modeled a different appr oach (Lim, Park, & Han, 2009). Integration in North Korea was an outgrowth of the need to use indigenous resources while modernizing the healthcare system during reconstruc tion efforts in the wake of the Korean War. In 1956 a governmental directive encouraging the ap plication of the science of biomedicine to evaluate and promote effective traditional medicine was issued. In 1962 a formal 3 month training course to help biomedical doctors correct their misconceptions about traditional medicine was organized. These courses also encourag ed the combination of eastern and western medicine. Since 1975 training in traditional medici ne has become the focus of 1 and even 2 year 'reorientation' programs required for the faculties of medical schools. The use of western diagnostics combined with eastern or traditional th erapeutics has become a standard in most INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 41 hospitals and clinics with some of the providers li censed in traditional medicine trained in and allowed to prescribe western medications as well as some biomedical providers offering traditional treatments. This is due at least in par t to the organization of medical schools which will have a department of clinical (biomedical) med icine as well as a department of Koryo (traditional/eastern) medicine (Lim et al., 2009). For many of these schools the department of Koryo m edicine was originally a subdivision of the department of clinical medicine. However the degree of cross training is not necessarily equal. The curricula of the biomedical services have less exposure to Koryo medicine when compared with Department of Koryo student's st udy of biomedical topics. This leaves the students from the Department of Koryo medicine bett er prepared to offer an integrative treatment plan. The increased use of biomedical diagnostics i s in response to the sometimes ambiguous nature of traditional diagnostic criteria which oft en led two different Koryo providers to give two different traditional diagnosis to patients with th e same pattern of illness as classified by western diagnostics and taxonomy (Lim et al., 2009). Despite the attempt at integration and utilizing tr aditional resources North Korea does not compare well in WHO rankings of health system perfo rmance. In this regard North Korea consistently falls into the bottom 25 th percentile in all domains of measurement when comp ared to the other 190 countries evaluated. The constant state of economic and political crisis in North Korea likely has a large role to play in the poor p erformance of its health systems but the persistence of outmoded and crude practices within the integrative efforts as well as the demonstrated lack of safety of many of the therapie s that persist in use must also be part of the critical appraisal (Lim et al., 2009). INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 42 Waikiki Health Centers The last two decades, subsequent to the Native Hawa iian health care act of 1988, has brought a resurgence in traditional medicine to the islands. The Waikiki Health Centers have two locations highlighted in an article by Broad & Alli son (2002). The Ho Ola Like Outreach Project and the inner city Palolo community clinic bring to gether nurse practitioners and traditional Hawaiian healers. The traditional offerings include Kahuna la au lapa au (pharmacotherapists who use plants, herbs, corals and seaweed to treat illness); Kahuna lomilomie (physiotherapist); and Ho oponopono, which is practiced by Kahuna ehu who, much like psychiatrist and psychologist, focus on social discord, relationship and harmony building in family and friends. Clients who come to the clinics can self-select a w estern or traditional healthcare provider as well as the option to choose both and t he NPs and Healers have freedom to refer patients to each other. As with SCF environment is key to the therapeutic nature of the clinic. There is a purposefully casual atmosphere cultivate d in order to enhance the therapeutic nature of the relationships between the clinic clients and pr oviders. Typically clients choose Hawaiian medicine for the treatment of chronic health condit ions especially musculoskeletal problems, with the exception of diabetes and hypertension. Tr eatment by the Nurse practitioners was favored for acute illness and some other chronic il lness such as asthma and gout (Broad & Allison, 2002). St. Mary's Hospital St. Mary's Hospital is a Catholic faith-based hospi tal in Arizona. Recognizing that many of the Navajo clients they served were entering a v ery foreign environment they sought to create a more welcoming atmosphere to the Native American population and to provide a more culturally sensitive experience. During the course of their exploration of these efforts they INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 43 identified the following challenges inherent to the integration of culture consideration and healthcare Acknowledgement that TIM spiritual beliefs and prac tices are integral to the healing process. Deciding how specific spiritual practices could be addressed in assessments. Accommodation of the physical space needed for some spiritually oriented practices Fostering an environment that is welcoming to spiri tual practitioners. Blending cultural spiritual practices of patients w ith the cultures of the healthcare professionals at the hospital (Hubbert, 2008). The answer to these challenges was a series of educ ational conferences that were 5 to 7 days in length. These were developed by a 'Guiding team' who worked with a Comanche medicine man, Mr. Edgar Monetathchi Jr.. Mr. Moneta thchi was the national Traditional Indian Medicine (TIM) specialist for the IHS. The strategy that ultimately proved effective in driving the changes and promoting the staff at the hospital to be open to TIM was a sharing not of the mechanics of the traditional healing ceremonies, bu t rather teaching them to identify and appreciate the philosophy of TIM so that they could personalize their approach to it with individual patients (Hubbert, 2008). Two main educational concepts drove the sharing of this philosophy. The first was entitled 'The seven sacred Aspects'. The seven sacr ed aspects, according to Mr. Monetathchi, are: respect, honesty, truth, humility, compassion, wisdom, and unconditional love. The second concept was that of 'The essence of the holistic in dividual'. Health equals balance was the underlying principle communicated with this idea; t he individual being representative of balance INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 44 between the physical being, the mental being, the s piritual being, the environment and that individual's relationship with God. Illness and dis ease are conceptualized as one or more of these items being out of balance. Ultimately the educatio n of the staff towards these underlying philosophies and principles enabled them to accommo date those individuals who were entering a culturally foreign environment and improve the rela tionships and treatment outcomes (Hubbert, 2008). General Principles of Integration/Harmonization Besides case studies, I identified articles that d iscussed principles of integration and harmonization more generally, in the context of com munities and cultures but in a less case oriented fashion. Despite the desire to focus on ca se studies it would be a disservice to the topic to ignore the input these articles have on developi ng models of integrative care. The WHO and Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) have suggested key principles that should be considered in developing healthcare systems. The PAHO cites the need for creating of a legal framework that facilitates access by the indigenous population to quality health care while officially recognizing the contri butions of indigenous health systems to the maintenance and restoration of the population's hea lth. Indigenous knowledge, practices and resources should be recognized as a legitimate heal th system and safety, efficacy, and quality of the traditional medicine should be promoted in ways that encourage rational use. The standardization of education and certification requ ired in biomedicine stands in stark contrast to the methods of developing and passing down traditio nal medicine (Eby, 1998). This is not to suggest that we should hold them to the exact same standard, but developing methods to ensure the safety of the practices and the quality of the practitioners should be part of the agenda. INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 45 Lastly, nations should promote the formulation and implementation of models that prioritize an understanding of the social and cultu ral characteristics of the beneficiary population, their resources and specific epidemiological profil es (PAHO/WHO, 2002; WHO, 2005, 2009). While developing these policies some very specific guidelines should be considered: Knowledge of traditional medicine, treatments, and practices should be respected, preserved, promoted and communicated wid ely and appropriately based on circumstances... Governments should establish systems for the qualif ication, accreditation or licensing of traditional medicine practitioners. Communication between conventional and traditional medicine providers should be strengthened and appropriate training pro grams established for health professionals, medical students and relevant researchers (WHO, 2009, p. 11) When evaluating indigenous cultures for their healt hcare needs it is important avoid overemphasizing the cultural identity within an age nda based solely on what they don't have. This approach homogenizes otherwise distinct popula tions and obscures their individual capacities and resources. Models of integration sho uld incorporate an indigenous perspective, medicine and therapy while maintaining technical ex cellence in addition to promoting an understanding of the social and cultural variables that impede access to healthcare (PAHO/WHO, 2002). Challenges For many indigenous cultures modern technology and medicine are seen as reinforcing of the values and practices of western society. In som e views this is undesirable and creates tension INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 46 (Bruce, 2002). The reciprocal effect is then hoped to be at work with models of integration. Ideally the inclusion and harmonization of traditio nal practices will be seen to reinforce cultural identity and continuity. That said though it is not necessarily a smooth road to integration. Historical context and historical trauma. As a Native woman coming into the western system, g oing to the doctor and you have 15 minutes. That's the time allowed. And as a Native w oman coming into a system that has been notoriously abusive to you throughout your who le life, you have 15 minutes to go in and say what's wrong with you. You're never going t o say it. It's not going to happen (Benson, 2003, p. 11). Understanding the cultural context of bringing toge ther 'Western/European' models of care with indigenous culturally bound healing tradi tions must necessarily look, even if briefly, at the historical conflict between the cultures and wh at has brought us to a place of wanting to harmonize our approach to healthcare. Why we even n eed to take steps down that road. Why, we aren't already doing it and why we haven't been doi ng it all along. The concepts of colonialism, historical trauma and subsequent decolonization eff orts are pertinent to the discussion. The arrival of Europeans brought disease and oppres sion via war famine and genocide to the native cultures of North America. The toll of t hese historical events also yielded grave cultural destruction (Lucero, 2011). The total cost s of these events is described in the concept of Historical Trauma which describes the loss of cult ure, self-esteem, self-determination and sense of well-being suffered over the generations by Nati ve cultures (Morgan, 2009). As progressive as our country might be now, there i s a long history of the kinds of traumatic practices that stripped native peoples of their culture etc. For decades upon decades INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 47 public policies and laws made it essentially, or ev en literally at times, illegal to live or act \"native\" (Benson, 2003; Dolchok, 2003). It will probably be surprising to some to see how o nly very recently these disparities began to be addressed. It was not until 1974 with t he passing of PL 93-638 also known as the Indian Self-Determination and Education assistance act that any real change was made. This, after a century of persistent policies that subjuga ted AI/AN tribal peoples to the oppression of the reservation system, to the relegation of second-cla ss citizen standing. While the Self Determination act improved tribal entities ability to direct their own social agendas it wasn't until 1988 with the Ethnic identity and political e ntities extension with the allocation of funds in a block grant style that the way was paved for trib es to take over management of health care organizations and facilities (Lucero, 2011; Morgan, 2009) Even the World Health Organization has been slow to address the issue of the loss of culture as it relates to traditional tribal healing . In 1993 a division of the WHO, The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) laid out the He alth of the Indigenous people's initiative. The principles of this initiative state that indige nous peoples have a right to a holistic approach to health, the right to self-determination, the necess ity of respect to and revitalization of indigenous cultures, reciprocity in relations, and the right o f indigenous peoples to systematic participation in healthcare (PAHO/WHO, 2002). More recent trends such as the Beijing Declaration of November 2008 are consistently more reassuring. The Beijing Declaration, from the WHO, recognizes traditional medicine as one of the potential resources of primary health ca re services (WHO, 2009). It has only been in the last couple of decades that the culture of biom edicine has been encouraged to shed its INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 48 ethnocentricity and begin looking at healthcare thr ough the lens of cultural humility and mutual respect. Critical views of integrative efforts. It is worth noting that integrative/harmonization efforts are not universally thought of as necessary or even important. Many communities don't actually expect an improvement in health care when services are integrated and it has been suggested that pleas for integration are inspired b y overly romantic notions concerning traditional medicine and indigenous cultures (van d er Geest, 1997). In an editorial in the British Medical Journal (BMJ ) Margaret McArtney calls the concept of integrative medicine a rebranding of alternative medicine which is really just medicine that doesn't work. This is a response mostly to homeopat hic medicine; a European alternative medical paradigm that Dr. McCartney says is effecti ve only in so far as the placebo effect can carry it. These providers, she opines, are attempti ng to corner the market on the one thing that they have that does work: listening and spending ti me with patients. Listening carefully, being patient centered, encouraging your patients, and be ing compassionate are not a specialty she argues and dressing them up with placebo pills and questionable therapies is just an attempt at creating a specialty out of something that is alrea dy in the domain of evidence based physicians; as if EBP medicine somehow precludes good listening and humanism. Not true she says and argues that \"real evidence based care\" can only be offered by biomedical physicians grounded in the context of evidence based practice (McCartney, 2011). This editorial is a perfect example of the strain t hat exists between biomedicine and alternative paradigms, including traditional medici ne. When looking at efforts to harmonize biomedicine with traditional medicine a few theoret ical models have been suggested. Boon et al. have a framework wherein the outline seven relation ships on a continuum from 'Parallel' INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 49 progressing in a continuously more integrated fashi on through & Broom, 2009). An alternative model is suggested by Mann et al. wh ere a continuum of attitude and educational advancement in the practitioner is desc ribed. This theory starts first with the 'informed clinician' and progressing through medicine in the academic medical center' (Adams et al., 2009). Adams et al. (2009) calls into question the typical framework/continuum models that describe the variety of potential relationships tha t have been observed to exist when biomedical and traditional medicine meet. The concern is that these models don't adequately take into consideration the tensions and power struggles that exist between biomedical and traditional medicine, the contradictions in philosophy, diagnos is and treatment that exist, and the fact that these framework style models are based on ideal cir cumstances that rarely are observed in reality when the biomedical and traditional medicine worlds collide. The current generations of integrative medicine see m to support these concerns in light of research that has demonstrated a lack of legitimate professional level integration of traditional and alternative therapies in observed practice sett ings. Unfortunately cases describing marginalization, cooptation and exclusionary practi ces are more common in the integrative setting than the 'ideal' situations described in th e framework/model scenarios proposed in the literature (Adams et al., 2009). INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 50 Evidence based practice arguments. With evidence based practice (EBP) being the standard of care in biomedical clinics there is som e concern about how traditional medicine will hold up to the scrutiny of EBP. Others have little concern when looking at the definitions of EBM as according to William Sackett and cite his st atement that EBM is the \"integra[tion] of clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research\"(Sackett, Rosenberg, Gray, Haynes, & Richa rdson, 1996, pp. 71 - 72). If clinical expertise is equal in footing with 'external clinic al evidence' then there is little concern when considering that many traditional medicine knowledg e funds extend back thousands of years. However, further reading suggests that the gold sta ndard to which all interventions ultimately must be held accountable to are the results gleaned from \"patient centred clinical research... [This] external evidence both invalidates previousl y accepted diagnostic tests and treatments and replaces them with new ones that are more powerful, more accurate, more efficacious and safer\"(Sackett et al., 1996, p. 72). The question t hen is asked will traditional medicine hold up under such scrutiny? Should it be expected to? According to Mignone et al. (2007) best practice tr eatments in healthcare should satisfy a set of criteria: tangible, positive impact; be sust ainable; be responsive and relevant (to patient/community/culture and environmental reality ); be client focused; improve access; coordinate and integrate services; be efficient and flexible; demonstrate leadership; be innovative; have potential for replication; identif y health and policy needs, and have capacity for evaluation. There is a movement that seeks to legit imize the use of AI/AN traditional healing practices as valid stand-alone EBP in the context o f culturally specific systems of care (Lucero, 2011). INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 51 A counter argument to the EBP movement suggests tha t standards of care expressed in the literature may not be reliably validated in the AI/AN community due to their status as a significant population minority who are not well, i f at all, represented in many of the trials used to establish the evidence (Lucero, 2011; Struthers et al., 2004). There is additional concern that the funding requirements from agencies such as the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMSHA) are biased against implemen tation of culturally relevant but heretofore untested interventions. For some tribal entities, the approval process is onerous and in the context of historical trauma: concern over cult ural appropriation and co-optation leads many tribal organizations to be hesitant in formalizing requests for funding and implementation of these traditionally derived interventions. Yet the ability or AI/AN groups to exercise legitimate self-determination and break the mentality of colon ization require that they be allowed to implement these proprietary, community based eviden tiary practices (Jagtenberg et al., 2006; Lucero, 2011). For many the EBM movement promotes a view that evid ence from tradition is less valid and less reliable than the gold standard of 'patien t centred clinical research'. In response to this some have suggested that an evaluation of the philo sophical assumption underlying EBM and CAM should be evaluated (Jagtenberg et al., 2006) T hese philosophical differences include not only the approach of treatment but also the ultimat e goal of treatment suggesting that EBM may have a place in evaluating traditional medicine but as part of a mix of evidence rather than the only judge of validity (Jagtenberg et al., 2006; Sa ckett et al., 1996). \"Evidence based medicine is not restricted to rando mized trials and meta-analyses. It involves tracking down the best external evidence w ith which to answer our clinical questions... When asking questions about therapy... we should try to avoid the non-experimental INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 52 approaches... however some questions about therapy do not require randomized trials... we must follow the trail to the next best external evidence and work from there\" (Sackett et al., 1996, p. 72) Waldram (2000) suggests that there is disconnect b etween what western science considers evidence of effectiveness versus what tri bal peoples consider it to be. He argues that the conceptualization of efficacy is wrapped up in culturally based concepts of health and illness. This is relevant in the context of recognizing and understanding that every medical system, including biomedicine is a cultural system. Due to cultural perspectives healing and curing may ultimately be different things as well as understan ding that concepts of disease and illness may not be equivocal. For many cases in the indigenous paradigm healing may not actually entail curing (Waldram, 2000; Young, 1983). Much of this may go to a problem with understanding the root of illness/disease. The philosophical root of American western culture main tains an emphasis on the individual - the individual in the free market, individual ownership , etc. Classic religion driven duality has given way to secular science driven rationality in the ma nagement of disease and populations. Faith in science leads to medical care being synonymous with healthcare. The emphasis on causative agents i.e. germ theory of medicine or physiologic disorder fits well with mechanistic reductionist perspectives but leaves a difficult ga p in the treatment of illness that does not fall into a specific category (Eby, 1998). In some instances a traditional healer may attribut e a metaphysical causation to a disease with an otherwise clearly defined biomedical taxono mical designation. A classic example of this is an illness like susto or soul loss due to fright, as experienced in Hisp anic communities. In biomedical surveys individuals diagnosed with susto by a traditional or folk medicine INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 53 practitioner could be found to have no distinct clu ster of biomedically designated features (Waldram, 2000). There is a reasonable concern that some of this is distinctly cultural but one must ask if the misunderstanding of efficacy in tre atment speaks to postcolonial biomedicalization of traditional medicine or Tribal healers confounding biomedical terms along with biomedicine co-optation of traditional treatme nts? In this context perhaps it would be beneficial to use definitions more specific to them selves: Curing as specific to pathogenic disease where healing is predicated on the particul ar perception and expectations of sick people (Young, 1983). Resistance. Another issue is the importance of asking if the po pulation wants collaboration and harmonization. In many African cu ltures people have divided their use patterns between biomedical and traditional providers based on the nature of the given illness. Integrated services would not serve to change the pattern of use because they have already developed a system of their own in which they classify certain illness as being more appropriate for one approach and others for the alternative (van der Ge est, 1997). In some areas participation in traditional-medicine based integrative processes may meet with resistance. If they correlate traditional heal ing with mystical practices such as black magic and witchcraft they will be reticent to participate . Incorporating the traditional healing practices in a harmonized fashion legitimizes them and dista nces from these other exploitive forms of 'medicine' (Bruce, 2002). Not as severe as perceivi ng traditional medicine as witchcraft but still damaging to efforts in integrating is seen when bio medicalization of the healthcare environment has taken place and indigenous knowledge is conside red primitive or unscientific (Barbee, 1986; PAHO/WHO, 2002). In other areas resistance from som e churches, especially evangelical INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 54 Christian churches to traditional medicine or aspec ts of traditional medicine has led to the sidelining of ceremonial practices such as shamanic rituals (Mignone et al., 2007). Lastly, there is a concern about individuals havin g a desire to invest in traditional medicine. The move towards western medicine paralle ls increasingly busy lifestyles where \"People do not have time for frequent visits or pre paring herbal teas\" (Burke et al., 2003, p. 1083) Discussion As evidenced by the content of this review, informa tion on contemporary practice of traditional AI/AN is scarce; even knowing the names of some clinics that have experimented with various levels of integration led to minimal d escriptive information during the course of the literature search. Factors that have contributed to this over the years are fear of ridicule and concern about misuse or co-optation of the informat ion. Healing is often considered a private matter, and even a sacred process. Additionally for many of these traditions there is no written documentation. Sometimes this is because the tradit ion is passed orally, but in many instances it is because there is a lack of formal educational ex perience for practitioners. This, combined with processes and diagnosis that don't necessarily rely on the biomarkers or taxonomy used in biomedical 'evidence based practice', leaves the tr eatments and their effectiveness outside the paradigm of the scientific community (Struthers et al., 2004). Basic themes identified during the course of this l iterature review include a priority to respect individual right to choose religious/spirit ual paths (Benson, 2003). A culturally sensitive service must consider the cultural diversity of peo ple, their beliefs, culture, language and worldview. To succeed at integrative efforts we mus t accept and respect these differences. We must understand that health is not just physical fi tness (Conejo, 2009). INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 55 The South American cases highlighted by Mignone et al. (2007) demonstrate that systems do not have to function in opposition to on e another. They also support a shift from exclusively biomedical models to intercultural heal th programs and practices that support indigenous organizations. Aside from cultural resistance and concerns about h ow traditional medicine fits in an EBP directed world, funding is a legitimate concern . In all the case studies that were surveyed from south America funding for traditional operatio ns came from NGO donors, fee for service or re-allocation of surplus administrative funds. It w as rare for government funding to be adequate or even directly available (Mignone et al., 2007). With funding tied to the biomedical treatment model s it becomes a challenge to bring traditional medicine into the mainstream healthcare setting without imposing the biomedical framework of diagnosis and illness onto the traditi onal methods. As an extension of public law 93-638 the Indian self-determination act of 1975, t he potential and opportunity for restructuring and reprioritizing the funding to bring it into ali gnment with traditional values is there; however, we need to develop a pattern of alignment that does not have biomedicine co-opting tradition nor traditional medicine being blindly accepted without critical appraisal. Efforts to recognize that what is effective and what is being treated are def ined by cultural constructs will play an important role in this and therefore need to be eva luated in that light (Eby, 1998). In all south America case studies except Suriname w here shaman's apprentices were being taught to use a medical record, adequate data collection was a barrier to long-term planning, operations, monitoring, evaluation and re search (Mignone et al., 2007). This is unlikely to be a problem in the North American setting of bu ilding an integrated program from the ground up. INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 56 There is also recognizing the importance of having not just government facility resources, but community resources and indigenous community le aders who are willing to take charge and ownership of the programs (Benson, 2003). True plur alism in health care will create a resource that is socially desirable, will serve people best, be cost effective and culturally important to preserve (Burke et al., 2003; Weil, 2011). Tina Melin, a provider who worked in Kotezebue, Ala ska said it best: The people of [Alaska] wish to put their heads and hearts together with guidance from our creator to attempt to get to the root of the ca use or suffering... they have their own legitimate ways of knowing how to do this. Those of us who are a part of the health care system need to work together with them... They wish t o remember the healthy ways of the days of old blended in with the new... they wish to regain and strengthen their cultural identity and pride. They wish to help them selves and each other to get on that path to health and stay there (Morgan, 2009, p. 89) INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 57 Appendix A References Adams, J., Hollenberg, D., Lui, C., & Broom, A.

Design This is a review of the literature. The search was conducted using: MeSH terms 'traditional medicine' and 'integrative medicine' i keywords: cultur*.*, enculturation, maintenance; author-as-keyword; and bibliographic review in CINAHL, Medline, PubMed and Google Scholar. Findings Globally, there are diverse approaches to healing. Unifying concepts of TM were identified to validate using cases from different c ultures. Key principles of integration were identified. Six case studies suitable for applicati on are included. Discussion Four areas of focus were identified. Integrative ef forts should focus on communication including modes of entering treatment, space and ae sthetic concerns, attitudes of employees toward different modalities, and qualification of p roviders. INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 63 Describing a Sustainable Model of Harmonization bet ween Culturally Congruent Traditional Healing and Evidence Based Biomedical Models In 2006, while traveling with a medical expedition, I stumbled across a unique clinic in the mountain region of Ecuador. Nestled there, in O tovalo, is the Jambi Huasi clinic. On staff at Jambi Huasi are physicians, a medicine man, and a f olk healer. The clinic also has a pharmacy, herbarium, dental clinic and a laboratory. It is a highly integrated, self-sustaining operation and an enviable blend of culture care and medicine. Mod els like this, especially in North America, are rare. Objectives The purpose of this paper is to explore models of i ntegration between TM and BioM. TM is a broad term that refers to systems of health an d wellness that are rooted in indigenous culture. BioM is synonymous with allopathic or 'western' med icine. Efforts at integration that have been described in the literature are reviewed with an ey e toward answering the following question: How do you successfully and sustainably integrate T M with BioM in using proven methods of collaboration? Significance Cultural perspectives in healthcare have experience d increased recognition. With increased awareness has come improved models of cul ture care. Newer models of culturally sensitive care use the principle of CH which recogn izes that culturally-congruent care should be based on collaboration, allowing both parties to br ing valuable information to the table. This departs from previous standards where it was consid ered sufficient to possess a list of facts about a culture (Tervalon & Murray-Garcia, 1998). This is key relative to the protective nature of enculturation and the role that traditional practic es play in promoting cultural identity INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 64 (Winderowd, Montgomery, Stumblingbear, Harless, & H icks, 2008). When Native communities validate cultural values in an environment of heali ng individuals are more are likely to seek care and adhere to treatment (Mignone, Bartlett, O'Neil, & Orchard, 2007; Novins et al., 2004). Tina Melin, a provider who worked in Kotezebue, Ala ska with the American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) population summed up t he driving sentiment for an effort directed at harmonization: The people of this region wish to put their heads a nd hearts together with guidance from our creator... they have their own legitimate ways of knowing how to do this. [We] need to work together with them... They wish to remember t he healthy ways of the days of old blended in with the new... they wish to regain and st rengthen their cultural identity and pride. They wish to help themselves and each other to get on that path to health and stay there (Morgan, 2009, p. 89). Methods Review of the Literature In order to understand the implications of bringing BioM together with TM practices a review of the literature was conducted. Emphasis wa s placed on locating published works that describe instances of collaboration and key princip les that drive successful integration. Search Strategy The MeSH terms 'traditional medicine' and 'integrat ive medicine' were used in search strings. Additional keywords used include: Native A merican, Alaska Native, tribal, culture*.*, enculturation, identity, and maintenance. Inclusion criteria were initially limited to any article published within 10 years regarding TM and cultural identity as well as any case studies without restriction to time. Due to a dearth of topic speci fic articles the time constraint was opened to an INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 65 unrestricted timeline for all subjects queried. The search using the terms noted above, as well as searches for reports of cases known anecdotally to the author was conducted in CINAHL, Medline and PubMed. Additional strategies included author-as-keyword using individuals involved in the field of enculturation and integrat ive medicine, as well as ancestry methods of bibliographic review. Searches in Google Scholar we re used to identify pertinent grey literature. Results Through a review of the literature I identified a series of cases studies and some reports by the World Health Organization (WHO) which offere d practical suggestions for the development of healthcare systems including the rol e of TM in those systems. Ten case studies were found. Only six of these were useful with obse rvations suitable for application. These cases were based on a specific setting of collaboration t hat described the interface between TM and BioM providers within a defined relationship. Other cases not included had descriptions that were too general or described the presence of TM pr oviders in a community but without specific collaborative relationships in place. Two of the be st described clinics: Jambi Huasi in Ecuador and the Southcentral Foundation (SCF) Traditional H ealing Clinic (TC) in Anchorage, Alaska; stand out as exemplary. Conceptualization of Traditional Healing TM is a broad term that refers to systems rooted in indigenous culture. For the purposes of this paper indigenous culture is comprised of pe rsons who self-identify as indigenous or tribal. These are communities, and nations with continuity to a pre-invasion/colonial society (Struthers, Eschiti, & Patchell, 2004; WHO, 2005) . Although many cultures have an historical medicine tradition there should be caution in assuming a globally homogenous 'traditional medicin e' body. Grouping together everything \"not INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 66 ours\" i.e., not BioM, is ethnocentric so the approa ch should be cautious (van der Geest, 1997). Despite a lack of homogeneity it is useful to ident ify themes that reflect congruency in world- view among TM paradigms. By identifying common them es we validate the use of models from multiple cultures as points of reference when desig ning systems of integration from the ground- up. TM models around the world operate in both the phys ical and spiritual realms. This perspective differs from the more reductionist patt erns of BioM 2002; PAHO/WHO, 2002; Struthers et al., 2004). For indigenous peoples health and illness tend to be holistic in the greatest sen se (van der Geest, 1997). \"The concept of health is not limited to the absence of pain or illness, b ut the harmony and the internal balance of the person in the family, the community, the nature and the cosmos\" (Jambi Huasi, 2005). Indeed, the WHO describes health as a state of complete phy sical, mental and social well-being, not only the absence of disease (PAHO/WHO, 2002; van der Gee st, 1997) .When complete health includes social well-being, the community becomes a contributor to individual health. Any solution to a problem is potentially the responsibi lity of the group (Eby, 1998; van der Geest, 1997). Another unifying construct of cultural medicine tra ditions is health and balance as a life- long pursuit. \"To benefit from Indian medicine powe r one has to possess conviction and feeling in it and be involved in that particular way of lif e\" (Struthers et al., 2004, p. 143). TM has an endurance of practice through time (Wing, 1998). It is a way looking at the world through the lenses of your ancestors. \"Not something we take of f a shelf when it's convenient and then put it back when we are done\" (Lowe, 2012). It is a comple te way of life passed down generation to generation (Kyba, 2013). INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 67 By finding specific cases of effective integration and considering the congruent facets of TM we can create a system that has a strong foundat ion built on proven principles of success. Case Studies Six cases are presented here. More sources with inf ormation about Jambi Huasi and Southcentral Foundation were located than for the o thers which, while less detailed, still provide useful practice considerations for the integrated s etting. Clalit Health Services - Israel. A study by Ben-Arye, Scharf and Frenkel (2007) look ed at interdisciplinary communication among the broad network of BioM providers and Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) practi tioners employed by Clalit Health Services, a health maintenance organization in Isra el. Low rates of communication are already a well-estab lished fact. As litmus for this, in response to a survey conducted in 2006, a majority of U.S. physicians indicated a strong referral relationship with other BioM physicians but no refe rral relationship with any chiropractors. The majority of the providers surveyed by Ben-Arye et a l. were interested in collaboration and indicated a willingness to communicate, preferably by consultation letter, to formulate treatment plans. The authors suggest that education on commun ication between disciplines to overcome \"language\" barriers related to differences in train ing and philosophy could promote collaborative communications (Ben-Arye et al., 2007). Waikiki Health Centers. The Ho Ola Like Outreach Project and the inner city Palolo Community Clinic in Hawaii, staff nurse practitione rs (NP) and traditional Hawaiian healers. Clients come to the clinics, self-select a NP, a TM provider, or may work with both. The NPs and healers are free to refer patients to each othe r and they cultivate a casual atmosphere to enhance therapeutic relationships between clients a nd providers. A minor compartmentalization INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 68 of treatment is in place as clients typically choos e Hawaiian medicine for chronic conditions like musculoskeletal problems. Treatment by the NP is fa vored in acute illness and chronic disease states such as diabetes, hypertension, asthma and g out (Broad & Allison, 2002). St. Mary's Hospital. St. Mary's is a Catholic hospital in Arizona. Seein g that many of their Navajo clients were entering a foreign enviro nment they sought to create a more culturally sensitive atmosphere. During a study of these effor ts they identified five challenges inherent to the integration of culture concern and BioM healthc are: 1) Acknowledging that spiritual beliefs and practices are vital to a healing process. 2) De ciding how to assess for spiritual practices. 3) Accommodation of the space needed for spiritual pra ctices. 4) Fostering an environment welcoming to spiritual practitioners. And, 5) blend ing cultural practices of patients with the cultures of the healthcare professionals employed a t the hospital (Hubbert, 2008). The strategy that proved effective in promoting sta ff to be open to TM was teaching them to identify and appreciate its philosophies. This w as accomplished via a series of educational conferences up to seven days in length. The trainin g was developed with a Comanche medicine man, Mr. Edgar Monetathchi Jr., who was the nationa l Traditional Indian Medicine (TIM) specialist for Indian Health Services (IHS). The tr aining did not teach the mechanics of TM, but opened employees to the ideas behind TM so that the y could personalize their approach to it with individual patients (Hubbert, 2008). Kwamalasamutu, Suriname. This village, located in the interior Amazon basin, has two clinics. One provides BioM services and is operated by a local non-government organization (NGO). The other, a TM clinic, is operated by elder tribal shamans with assistance from a U.S. based NGO. The choice to be treated in either clini c is entirely up to the individual client (Mignone et al., 2007). INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 69 Individuals from both clinics: shamans, medical mis sion health workers, and physicians lead workshops to raise awareness about TM, medicin al plants and indigenous concepts of health. The BioM providers offer training on basic primary care and preventative health issues. Referrals are routinely made between the clinics. T he TM clinic hosts a Shaman's apprentice program to preserve traditional knowledge. Part of the training for new apprentices is in filling out assessment and treatment forms used to document the conditions diagnosed and treatments provided by the shaman (Mignone et al., 2007). Jambi Huasi - Ecuador. In the mountain town of Otovalo, Jambi Huasi offers a full range of BioM and indigenous health services to the ethnic groups of the region (Conejo, 2009). Services. The clinic offerings are quite varied. Physicians, dentistry, pharmacy, and a clinical lab comprise the BioM services. An indigen ous Yachac (medicine man), Fregadora (herbalist/massage therapist) and a Pakarichik Mama (midwife) are available. This team of providers offers treatment for organic illness, emo tional disorders, and energetic diseases. They also operate a community health program (Conejo, 20 09; Mignone et al., 2007). Management. Some government and NGO moneys come in to support t he physicians, and nurses but these are insufficient to sustain al l operations so they also rely on a modest fee- for-service. Jambi Huasi is functionally a western style health care organization offering intercultural health care services managed by an in digenous entity (Conejo, 2009; Mignone et al., 2007). Environment. The clinic's goal is to provide health care with co nsideration to the local sociocultural situation and worldview, while valuin g the role of TM by institutionalizing TM and BioM together. The medical center is on sacred grou nd and the Clinic is oriented to the cardinal directions. The various providers were encouraged t o select their own offices (Conejo, 2009). INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 70 Southcentral Foundation - Anchorage, Alaska. Southcentral Foundation (SCF) was established in 1982 as a 501c(3) and obtained its f irst self-management contract in 1985. Services. SCF is in a collaborative ownership of the Alaska N ative Medical Center (ANMC) and operates over sixty five programs includ ing a Traditional Healing Clinic (TC) (Mala, Dolchock, & Daney, 2011). Access to the TC is only available via referral fro m a primary care provider (PCP). In 2010 the TC received 1074 referrals (Barber, 2011; Daney, 2012; Mala et al., 2011). Counseling, acute and chronic pain, smoking cessation, and chro nic fatigue are all reported as having been effectively treated in the TC. Of these, chronic pa in is the leading diagnosis referred in. Treatments include energy healing, massage, body ma nipulation and spiritual support (Benson, 2003; Morgan, 2009). Although the report of success is an anecdotal self-reporting, the SCF and ANMC have a reputation for excellence in the provis ion of healthcare for the region. That fact, and the large number of individuals referred in dem onstrate that the PCP affiliated with SCF are sufficiently pleased with their outcomes. Management. The healers that work in the TC are 'tribal doctors ' approved by the SCF Traditional Healing Committee of Elder Advisors and are certified in traditional native medicine (Benson, 2003; Mala et al., 2011; Morgan, 2009). An unfortunate weakness in the literature that was identified is that the definition of and the pr ocess for certification in traditional native medicine as conceptualized by the SCF is not explic ated. To promote a collaborative practice environment wi th the PCP, the providers in the TC use a standardized assessment and treatment form to document encounters (Daney, 2012). They hold regular consultation with other providers and engage in clinical rounds with the PCP staff, INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 71 mental health and pediatric clinics. They also atte nd to networking and educational opportunities with traditional healers from around the world (Mal a et al., 2011). SCF's model of care called Circle of Healing (COH) brings together BioM, CAM, and TM. A Pathfinder, who is familiar with all three ar eas, meets with clients to determine needs and goals. The Pathfinder works with each discipline to formulate a wellness plan (Benson, 2003). A certain amount of the success of the cultural eff orts at SCF can be credited to employee training. New employees at SCF facilities attend a three day orientation to learn expectations and approaches to care. Further training comes during a three day workshop which emphasizes empathy, compassion, and relationship building in p romoting the health of the 'customer- owners' (Helvey, 2010). Environment. Attention to the environment is also important (Ben son, 2003; Morgan, 2009). Healthcare is provided on a campus with nati ve decor and space is allocated for TM, CAM and BioM. Musical presentations by native perfo rmers are frequently present and the TC opens into a courtyard with an herbal garden (Morga n, 2009). An annual health fair builds on a tradition of community gatherings bringing communit y members together to celebrate their native culture, educate about health resources and promote healthy lifestyles (Helvey, 2010). Principles of Integration/Harmonization Some key principles of practice are demonstrated wi th good recurrence of themes throughout these case studies. Elements of practice ; from the suggestions on communication proposed by Clalit Health Services, the environment of the Waikiki Health Centers, the educational model of St. Mary's and the collaborati on and communication of the partnered clinics in Suriname are brought together in the mod els of Jambi Huasi and the SCF TC. The INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 72 principles demonstrated by these case studies fall into four categories: communication, environment, employee attitudes, and qualifications of TM providers. To give further credence to this synthesized model of care, these key elements align with recommendations from the WHO and PAHO regarding the development of healthcare systems. The items outlined by the WHO and PAHO include: 1) Communication between conventional and TM providers should be strengthene d. 2) Knowledge of TM treatments, and practices should be respected, preserved, and promo ted. 3) Training programs regarding TM should be established for health professionals. And , 4) governments should establish systems for accreditation or licensing of TM practitioners (WHO , 2009). These global organizations find each of these areas critical to the improvement of healthcare systems and recommend that they be implemented in a way that incorporates an indige nous perspective of medicine and therapy while maintaining technical excellence (PAHO/WHO, 2 002; WHO, 2005). Discussion Communication Communication matters encompass referrals and inter disciplinary treatment plans. The recommendation from Clalit Health services to offer training in interdisciplinary communication is in alignment with the WHO recommendation to impr ove communication between TM and BioM providers in order to promote collaboration. S tandardized documentation like that seen in Suriname and at the SCF clinic is one method of pro moting this. In their review of Jambi Huasi Mignone et al. (2007) found a lack of standardized documentation to be their only significant shortcoming. Referrals into the service lines can be done via se lf-referral like that seen at Suriname the Waikiki Health Centers and Jambi Huasi; or through PCP referral as noted in the SCF model. INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 73 Neither model was demonstrated superior in outcome so consideration of cultural and logistical needs regarding funding and reimbursement would lik ely promote one mode over the other for any given clinic. All three of the clinics that use a self-referral mode are operating in cultures tha t value a more casual approach where SCF with its req uirement for PCP referral operates within the schema of IHS documentation and funding require ments. Environmental Considerations Promoting an environment that is culturally appropr iate was part of successful integration in multiple clinics. Environmental principles inclu de geographic, space designation, and aesthetic considerations. For the Waikiki Health Ce nters this was accomplished through the promotion of a casual environment consistent with P acific Islander values. St Mary's acknowledged that finding the space for spiritually oriented healers to operate would have to be a critical consideration. Jambi Huasi focused on prin ciples of geography and space by orienting the clinic to the cardinal directions, building on sacr ed ground and allowing the healers to define their own needs with regard to work space. The SCF approach emphasizes aesthetic through the use of indigenous art, a traditional healing herb g arden and traditional native music performances. Any combination of these has the pote ntial to promote a harmonized healthcare model by validating the needs of the traditional he aler who is coming out of their traditional place in the community, into the potentially foreig n clinic setting (Bruce, 2002; Morgan, 2009). Attitudes Toward TM Ensuring indigenous management of the clinic is the first step toward ensuring a practice centered on the needs and culture of the people bei ng served. This is specifically noted in the shaman's clinic in Suriname, at Jambi Huasi, and th e SCF TC. Jambi Huasi built into their mission statements that they desire to provide care with the utmost respect for people and their INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 74 culture in conditions of equality but how they prom ote a positive attitude toward TM in their employees is not described. St. Mary's and SCF both implemented aggressive employee education initiatives which are in alignment with t he WHO recommendation to recognize and promote TM. St. Mary's and SCF accomplished this th rough seminars and workshops. For St. Mary's the training was focused on two main educational themes. The first was entitled 'The Seven Sacred Aspects'. The Seven Sacr ed Aspects, according to Mr. Monetathchi, are: respect, honesty, truth, humility, compassion, wisdom, and unconditional love. The second workshop series emphasized 'The Essence of the Holi stic Individual'. Health equals balance was the underlying principle communicated with the indi vidual being representative of balance between the physical being, the mental being, the s piritual being, the environment and that individual's relationship with God. This is consist ent with the medicine wheel model of balance that has been adopted by many AI/AN. Ultimately the education of the staff towards these underlying philosophies enabled them to accommodate those individuals who were entering a culturally foreign environment and improve the rela tionships and treatment outcomes they experienced (Hubbert, 2008). One of the key points is that the training emphasizes respect for the ideas of TM rather than trying to teach the mechani cs of TM. Qualifying TM Providers Tribal elders should have a role in qualifying heal ers but the WHO endorses formal qualification of traditional healers. In Suriname t he Shaman's clinic was operated by the Elders, and St. Mary's sought out the IHS TIM specialist to consult on their project. Jambi Huasi uses three different modalities of traditional healer bu t details on how those individuals were qualified was not part of any of the literature. INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 75 As noted above in the case study review section, SC F healers are qualified by tribal elders and through a specific certification process . As outlined, this particular set of requirements is most in line with the WHO recommendation. Unfort unately, the lack of detail on the specifics of what qualifies an individual as a 'Tribal Doctor ' for the SCF TC or the Yachac at Jambi Huasi means that information would have to be gleaned dir ectly from the sites themselves rather than relying on the literature. There is a provocative newer feature of IHS funding rules that provides for Naturopathic Doctors (ND) to be eligible for loan repayment (Ind ian Health Services, n.d.; Roubideaux, 2012). The congruency of philosophy between TM and Naturop athy may make NDs ideal to serve as a provider for the TM branch of an integrated clinic (Fleming & Gutknecht, 2010). This would speak to both formal qualification requirements and potential issues with reimbursement for traditional therapies. Limitations Information on contemporary practice of traditional AI/AN is scarce. Information about integrative efforts is equally so. Factors that hav e contributed to this over the years are fear of ridicule and concern about misuse, appropriation, o r co-optation of the information. Healing is often considered a private matter, and even a sacre d practice. This, combined with processes and diagnosis that don't necessarily rely on the biomar kers or taxonomy used in BioM 'evidence based practice', leaves the treatments and their ef fectiveness outside the paradigm of the scientific community (Struthers, Eschiti, & Patchel l, 2004). Because of this many tribal organizations are hesitant to publish about or form alize request for funding and implementation of these traditionally derived interventions. Despi te having firsthand knowledge of clinics pursuing integrative efforts it was a challenge to find published information about them. INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 76 However, networking through professional contacts I was able to identify specific tribal organizations that are formally pursuing some level of integrated health care. When contacted they seemed welcome to the idea of sharing organiza tion to organization or healer to healer but less interested in being part of any scholarly or a cademic inquiry. The exception to this was the First Nations Health Authority out of British Colum bia, Canada. They are developing a significant amount of material including a highly a nticipated Traditional Wellness Strategic Framework (Kyba, 2013). Moving Forward By identifying those specific concrete activities t hat have lead organizations such as Jambi Huasi and the SCF to be successful in their e fforts of integration we have a replicable pattern to follow. Four simple areas provide the be ginnings of a harmonized system. With promotion of good communication, creation of a heal ing environment that meets the needs of BioM providers and TM healers alike, clinic employe es who respect the philosophies of TM, and a staff of qualified TM providers, a healthcare org anization can begin down the path to a truly harmonized provision of health and wellness to the community they serve. A Healing Path True harmonization in health care creates a model t hat is desirable, cost effective, and culturally important (Burke et al., 2003; Weil, 201 1). Instead of pining: \"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood; And sorry I could not travel both, And be one traveler...\" We will find ourselves saying: \"Two roads converged in a wood... And both that morning equally lay, and both I kept to on that day ... and that has made all the difference\" (Frost, n.d .). This review only scratches the surface of what is b eing done to promote optimal culture care by implementing harmonization of TM and BioM w ithin healthcare systems. Effective INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 77 efforts in clinics desiring to pursue this model wi ll come with assistance of organizations already pursing harmonization whose work may not be describ ed in the literature. Replicable models are achievable and integrative efforts are well within the reach of the organization desiring to pursue this optimal level of culture care.

INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HEALING IN AI/AN TRIBAL HEA LTH 82 Appendix C Poster Project: Harmonizing Evidence Based Biomedic al Models of Healthcare with Culturally Congruent Traditional Healing Attached is a copy of the poster that was presente d during the University of Utah, College of Nursing, Poster Session on April 18, 2012. Harmonizing Evidence Based Biomedical Models of Hea lthcare with Culturally Congruent Traditional Healing Objective: How do you successfully integrate traditional medic ine (TM) with biomedical (BioM) oriented practices in the context of evidenc e based practice and principles of cultural humilit y? Jeremy C. Norton, BSN, RN, DNP-Candidate jeremy.norton@utah.edu Theoretical Framework: Enculturation theory. \"the process of socialization into and maintenance of the norms of one's indigenous culture including its salient ideas, con cepts and values\" 11 This project seeks to promote enculturation via the integration of traditional, culturally congruent, healing practices within the mainstream healthcare service model. Methods: A review of the literature for themes and cases A review of the literature was conducted using: MeSH terms 'traditional medicine' and 'integrative m edicine' in search strings Terms : Native American, Alaska Native, tribal, cul tur*.*, enculturation, identity, and maintenance. Author-as-keyword as well as ancestry methods of bi bliographic review. The search was conducted in CINAHL, Medline, PubMed and Google Scholar Results: Themes 1) Diverse approaches to healing, but unifying conce pts of TM identified to validate the use of cases s et in a variety of cultural backgrounds. 2) A comparison between TM and the BioM model. AComparison of Traditional Medicine with Biomedical models 16 Traditional Cultural Healing Pathways Biomedicine/Al lopathy Holistic approach Reductionist approach Culturaldefinition of health and illness used with physical, social and spiritual information to make diagnosis Patient centered history and physical along with biochemical, physiologic, anatomic, laboratory based dat a used to make diagnosis Health and harmony emphasized Disease and curing emphasized Honor patient for restoring wellness Credit to provider for curing Herbal/mineral/animal medicines may be used Pharmaceuticals (some herbals) may be used Preventative medicine taught Preventative medicine taught 3) Challenges to integration Historical Trauma Tension and power struggles: BioM vs. TM Evidence Based Practice - Randomized Control Trial vs. Evidence from tradition 4) Principles of integration -WHO guidelines Knowledge of TM: respected, preserved, and promoted Governments should establish systems for accreditation or licensing of TM providers. Communication between conventional and TM providers should be strengthened Training programs re: TM should be established for health professionals. 17 Best practice criteria: Treatment should: have a positive impact, be sustainable, be relevant, be client focused, improve access, have potential for replication, and have capacity for evaluation. 13 'El Encuentro ' - Jamie Zapata -1991 Mission To improve the health conditions of the indigenous population of Imbabura Province through the provision of alternative medical services; also to provide education for health and medical research; with the utmost respect for people and their culture in conditions of equality (Posted in the courtyard at Jambi Huasi, photo c.2006 ~ J. Norton) Mission To improve the health conditions of the indigenous population of Imbabura Province through the provision of alternative medical services; also to provide education for health and medical research; with the utmost respect for people and their culture in conditions of equality (Posted in the courtyard at Jambi Huasi, photo c.2006 ~ J. Norton) \"The concept of health is not limited to the absence of pain or illness, but the harmony and the internal balance of the person in the family, the community, the nature and the cosmos\" (Jambi Huasi, 2005). Results: Cases from the literature. Ten case studies were identified, six of which had useful recommendations or observations suitable for applic ation. Clalit Health Services - Israel. A health maintenance organization in Israel with a broad network of BioM physicians a nd CAM providers. This study: covers inter-disciplinary co mmunications. 2 Waikiki Health Centers. Two clinics operated by Waikiki Health Centers in Hawaii. Nurse Practitioners and traditio nal Hawaiian healers. Casual atmosphere to enrich therapeutic re lationships. 4 St. Mary's Hospital -Arizona. Recognizing that many of their Navajo clients were entering a foreign environment - sought to create a more culturally sensitive atmosphere. Iden tified five challenges to integration of culture care and BioM healthcare .8 Kwamalasamutu, Suriname. Village in the interior Amazon basin - two clinics, one provides BioM services operated by a NGO. The other is a TM clinic operated by elder tribal shama ns. Individuals from both clinics lead workshops about TM, indigeno us concepts of health, basic primary care issues and preventati ve practices. The indigenous medicine clinic hosts an apprentice prog ram. 13 Southcentral Foundation -Anchorage, Alaska. Southcentral Foundation (SCF) operates more than sixty five prog rams among these: the Alaska Native Medical Center and a Tradi tional Healing Clinic (TC). Counseling, acute and chronic pain, sm oking cessation, and chronic fatigue have all been succes sfully treated. Healers are certified in traditional native medicin e and approved by the Traditional Healing Committee of Elder Advisors . 1, 3, 7, 12, 14 Jambi Huasi - Ecuador. Offers: physicians, dentistry, pharmacy, and clinical lab; An indigenous Yachac (medicine ma n), Fregadora (herbalist/massage therapist) and Pakarichik Mama ( midwife). Treatment for organic illness, emotional disorders, and energetic diseases. Operate community health promotion progra m. 5, 13 Mam\u00e1 Juanita, the Fregadora from Jambi Huasi (L). A child (R ) receiving IV fluids at a makeshift clinic in Esmereldas, Ecuador. Photo c. 2006 ~J. Norton Discussion: Application This project demonstrates that pursuit of harmonize d healthcare is beneficial and gleaning information across cultures is an appropriate approach. While different in philosophy, BioM and T M have common ground. The biggest challenges lie in resolving his torical trauma and finding a unified definition of efficacy in practic e. Communication: Strong evidence of a poor history of communication between BioM and TM/CAM providers. Standardized med ical record of assessment and treatment. Education on effective communication. Entering in: Self vs. PCP referral. Both options successful. Nee d to match to cultural and logistical needs. Self-referr al may lead to compartmentalization of therapies. Environment: Organization of clinic space, orientation of buildi ngs and rooms to cardinal directions, a place for TM wi th its own aesthetic and environment that facilitates culturally oriente d provider/client interaction.Attitudes: Employee education initiatives crucial in promoting respect for TM. Key recommendation from the WHO. St. Mary's and SCF accomplished this through seminars and workshops em phasize respect for the ideas of TM rather than teaching the mechan ics of TM. Important in the context of employees who may not s hare the culture of the tribal group they are working with. Qualifying TM providers: Tribal elders should play a role in qualifying healers but the WHO recommends that form al qualifications for TM healers should be implemented . New IHS funding guidelines - Naturopathic Doctors (ND) eligi ble for loan repayment. 9, 15 The congruency of philosophy between many tribal cultures and ND may make them suited to serve in th e TM branch of an integrated clinic. 6 References: 1) Barber, V.
