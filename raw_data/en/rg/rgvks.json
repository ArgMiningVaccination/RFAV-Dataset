Women with breast cancer seek complementary and alter- native medicine (CAM) more than other patient populations with cancer. Nursing & Health Sciences 2012 Universitas Scientiarum 2012 BMC Cancer 2006 European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology 2012 European Journal of Cancer Care This qualitative study aims to investigate why men with cancer choose to use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), and whether CAM is used to fill 'gaps' in conventional cancer care or as an 'alternative' to conventional treatment. Interviews were carried out with 34 CAM users recruited from a National Health Service (NHS) oncology department, an NHS homeopathic hospital and a private cancer charity offering CAM. Participants used therapies to improve quality of life, to actively 'fight' the disease and possibly prolong life, but rarely as an alternative to conventional treatment. Many were initially sceptical about CAM, but took a 'pragmatic' and 'consumerist' approach to getting their needs met. Gaps in conventional care included: lack of empathy and support during and after treatment, poor continuity of care, and lack of advice on self-help, diet and lifestyle. The skills of CAM therapists may enable them to tap into the underlying ... 2012 BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2007 Integrative Cancer Therapies 2007 Perspectives of Oncology Nurses on Complementary and Alternative Medicine in Turkey A Cross-Sectional Survey 2018 In Turkey, between 22.1% and 84.1% of patients with cancer use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). However, few CAM-related studies have focused on the perspective of oncology nurses. This study aimed to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of Turkish oncology nurses regarding CAM. A descriptive cross-sectional survey of 127 participants was conducted in Ankara, Turkey. A semistructured questionnaire including characteristics, knowledge, attitudes, and practices of oncology nurses toward CAM was administered to participants. We found that more than half of nurses (54.0%) surveyed had no information on CAM modalities. Most oncology nurses (81.1%) used audiovisual media sources to obtain CAM information. Many nurses (81.3%) reported not using any CAM in cancer care, and only 26.8% recommended CAM to patients. Most nurses used CAM to accelerate wound healing (19.7%) and to manage symptoms, including constipation and diarrhea (8.8%) and anxiety (7.9%). Music (52.8%), massage (49.6%), and exercise (48.8%) were stated to be beneficial. Important barriers to use CAM for patients with cancer involved a lack of knowledge (60.6%); needing physician approval to apply any CAM methods to patients (52.1%); legal and institutional issues (47.2%); and limited educational, training, or certificate programs (44.1%). There is a need for increased knowledge about CAM by oncology nurses, considering their vital role in symptom management of patients with cancer. This can be achieved through solving legal and institutional problems, structured and comprehensive education/training programs, and the integration of CAM therapy into cancer care guidelines.
