What's the truth? Chances are that you've heard at least one purported benefit of kombucha. But if you don't know much about the drink, you probably still have some questions: Is it a tea, soda, wine, or something else entirely? Simply put, [kombucha](//www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/kombucha-nutrition-facts-health-benefits-how-make-it-best-brands-more/) is a fermented drink made by adding bacteria and yeast to a mixture of black or [green tea](//www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/green-tea-nutrition-health-benefits-side-effects/) and sugar, says [Alissia Zenhausern](https://www.nmdwellnessofscottsdale.com/) [, a licensed naturopathic medical doctor in Scottsdale, Arizona. (](https://www.nmdwellnessofscottsdale.com/) [1](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jchem/2015/591869/)) The ingredients used to make kombucha may sound sketchy. Yet this drink has become increasingly popular as a potential source of [probiotics](/probiotics/guide/), which are live organisms that help balance the intestinal flora. (1) \"It's easy to drink and digest, and it allows you to replenish your gut with good bacteria and restore your [digestive health](/digestive-health-pictures/superfoods-that-help-digestion.aspx),\" says Dr. Zenhausern. Sounds great, right? It's important to keep your expectations in check as you sip. While lots of people view kombucha as a gut-friendly food, the truth is that research on the fizzy drink is limited. ( [2](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/expert-answers/kombucha-tea/faq-20058126)) What Are the Possible Benefits of Kombucha? Nonetheless, early research suggests it may boost your gut health and more. Here's a glance at the potential benefits that researchers continue to explore. 1. May Help Boost Metabolism If you're looking to drop a few extra pounds, you'll likely consider anything that'll [jump-start your metabolism](https://www.everydayhealth.com/healthy-living/fitness/7-ways-speed-up-your-metabolism/). Kombucha isn't a miracle weight loss drink. But thanks to the epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) found in the green tea of some types of kombucha, it may be a secret to a slightly faster metabolism. EGCG is a catechin, a compound found in green tea. Catechins have the potential to boost metabolic rates in adults. But existing studies on the topic are short and small, and the authors of one 2017 review noted that more research is needed to know the true effects of EGCG on metabolism. ( [3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27883924/)) 2. May Aid Constipation As a potential source of probiotics, one purported health benefit of kombucha is its ability to balance good bacteria in the gut and relieve some [gastrointestinal](/digestive-health/common-digestive-conditions-from-top-bottom/) issues, but more research is needed. ( [4](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/14598-probiotics)) A 2014 study examined the microbial components of kombucha and identified a \"prominent lactobacillus population\" in the drink. ( [5](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24290641/)) Lactobacillus is a common type of probiotic, so it's plausible that kombucha may stabilize the digestive tract and help prevent infections and inflammation. And if so, probiotic-rich foods like kombucha might improve [irritable bowel syndrome](/irritable-bowel-syndrome/), inflammatory bowel diseases, [bloating](/digestive-health/is-bloating-cause-for-concern/), and [constipation](/constipation/guide/). (4) 3. May Reduce Inflammation Chronic inflammation is involved in just about every health condition, including heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, allergies, and respiratory illnesses such as [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)](https://www.everydayhealth.com/copd/guide/). ( [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493173/)) Kombucha isn't a first-line choice for treating any chronic disease, but the drink may complement your healthy diet, lifestyle choices, and medication regimen. That's because the teas used to make kombucha contain polyphenols, which are antioxidants that can lessen inflammation in the body. (1) There's also a growing belief in the scientific community that eating gut-friendly foods may help lower inflammation in the intestinal tract. ( [7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4315779/)) For this in particular, kombucha may be helpful. Inflammation is at the root of some gastrointestinal conditions, such as inflammatory bowel diseases, and research suggests that low-grade inflammation might contribute to irritable bowel syndrome. This inflammation may be the result of an imbalance of good and bad bacteria in the gut, known as gut dysbiosis. The idea is that when bad bacteria overtake the good, this triggers an immune system response, and it's this response that leads to inflammation. (7) 4. May Play a Role in Helping Prevent Cancer There's also growing evidence that kombucha may assist with the prevention of certain [types of cancer](/cancer/guide/), although more research is needed. This claim is based on green tea having [antioxidant properties](//www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/antioxidants-health-benefits-best-sources-side-effects-more/), which help rid the body of free radicals and other harmful substances that promote the growth of cancerous cells \u2014 and kombucha is often made from green tea. (3) One study found that kombucha inhibits angiogenesis, which is the growth of new blood vessels. ( [8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221052391200044X), [9](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/angiogenesis-inhibitors-fact-sheet)) The study highlighted that [prostate cancer](/prostate-cancer/guide/) is angiogenesis-dependent, meaning that new blood cells can feed and contribute to the growth of these tumors. By inhibiting angiogenesis, researchers concluded that kombucha could help decrease the survival of [prostate](/prostate/guide/) cancer cells. (8) Of course, more research is needed. The compounds in green tea that may help inhibit cancer growth include polyphenols, gluconic acid, glucuronic acid, lactic acid, and [vitamin C](/diet-nutrition/vitamin-c/). (3) 5. May Help Strengthen the Immune System The gut-healthy benefits of kombucha may also provide an immune system boost. (2) It's important to note that the digestive system and immune system are closely intertwined; the lining of the intestines creates antibodies that help protect the body. ( [10](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/research/advancements-in-research/fundamentals/in-depth/the-gut-where-bacteria-and-immune-system-meet)) A huge portion of the immune system \u2014 70 percent \u2014 is found in the gut. ( [11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2515351/)) Thus, Zenhausern explains, optimal gut health is the key to a strong immune system. The fermenting bacteria in kombucha can boost immunity, thanks to the dose of good bacteria they provide, she adds. 6. May Aid Depression Treatment [Symptoms of depression](/depression/guide/symptoms/) vary from person to person but can include a general feeling of sadness and hopelessness. Depression can also cause problems, including [insomnia](/insomnia/guide/), poor concentration, and low energy. ( [12](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20356007)) But kombucha might provide some relief, helping boost your mood by cranking up the production of feel-good hormones, such as [serotonin](/serotonin/guide/). (2) There haven't been studies specifically linking kombucha and depression. (2) But a 2017 study suggested that some psychiatric disorders may be connected with changes in the microbiome (the environment of bacteria in the gut), so there's increasing evidence that probiotics may help relieve symptoms of depression and anxiety. ( [13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5319175/)) Zenhausern further notes that 95 percent of serotonin is produced in your gut, not your brain, so optimal gut health is important for mental health and mood regulation, too. ( [14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2694720/)) \"This is why it is always important to address gut health when boosting mood and fighting against depression,\" she says. 7. May Boost Cardiovascular Health According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), heart disease increases the risk of stroke or heart attack, but healthy lifestyle changes can improve your cardiovascular health. ( [15](https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm)) This includes following a healthy diet that's high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and lean proteins. You should also incorporate exercise, medication when needed, and yes, even kombucha. The potential benefit is in kombucha's possible ability to positively influence [cholesterol levels](/high-cholesterol/guide/), according to research. (1) High cholesterol is one factor for heart disease, notes the CDC. (15) Researchers need to conduct more human studies to confirm the effectiveness of kombucha on cholesterol. But according to a 2015 study, rats administered kombucha showed lower levels of [LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol)](//www.everydayhealth.com/high-cholesterol/guide/ldl/) and higher levels of [HDL (\"good\") cholesterol)](//www.everydayhealth.com/high-cholesterol/guide/hdl/). More research is needed, but future studies could similarly reveal that kombucha [improves cholesterol levels](https://www.everydayhealth.com/high-cholesterol/diet/eight-foods-that-help-lower-cholesterol/) in humans. ( [16](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25856715/)) 8. May Promote Liver Health Similarly, kombucha may improve liver health due to its potential ability to detoxify the body. So over time, drinking the beverage may reduce how hard your liver has to work. (1) In one study, rats administered kombucha also showed decreased levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in their livers. This organic compound is a measure of cell and tissue damage. Still, more clinical research is needed to know whether the benefit holds up. (16) 9. May Play a Role in Lowering Blood Sugar Drinking kombucha might also benefit those who have insulin resistance or diabetes. The tea can inhibit -amylase, a protein in the [pancreas](/pancreatitis/guide/pancreas/) that's responsible for higher postprandial (after meal) glucose levels. ( [17](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22591682/)) Kombucha had a curative effect on rats with diabetes after 30 days, and it also improved their liver and kidney function, according to another study. (16) More research is needed, but the findings suggest that kombucha could one day be used as a complementary [treatment for diabetes](/diabetes/guide/), in addition to traditional approaches, including weight loss, diet, exercise, oral medications, and insulin. (16) 10. Help Maintain Healthy Weight Kombucha can be an alternative drink if you enjoy soda or juices yet are looking for a beverage with fewer calories and less sugar that may help you lose or maintain your weight. Sugar is high in empty calories, and when consumed in excess, there's the risk of taking in more calories than you burn, resulting in weight gain. Remember, kombucha isn't sugar-free (most of the sugar is fermented, but some remains in the final product). Even so, a typical drink may have only 6 to 8 grams (g) per serving, says Rebecca Silver, MS, RDN, who's based in Phoenix. \"You'll have to double the amount for brands that have two servings in a bottle, but it's still lower than your typical serving of a can of soda or juice drink, which can be upward of 25 g per serving,\" warns Silver. For comparison's sake, a bottle of organic, raw kombucha can have 60 calories and 16 g of sugar in 16.2 ounces. ( [18](https://gtslivingfoods.com/collections/classic-raw-kombucha/products/gts-classic-kombucha-original)) On the other hand, 16 ounces of soda can have 190 calories and 52 g of sugar. ( [19](https://www.coca-colacompany.com/faqs/how-much-sugar-is-in-coca-cola)) Available Flavors of Kombucha Fortunately, if you want to give kombucha a try, you don't have to make your own \u2014 but this is an option, too. Kombucha is available at health-food stores, grocery stores, and online. You'll find a variety of flavors to tempt your taste buds. Examples include these kombucha flavors: [Ginger](//www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/ginger-nutrition-facts-health-benefits-alternative-uses-more/) [Green tea](//www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/green-tea-nutrition-health-benefits-side-effects/) - Raspberry - Blueberry [Dragonfruit](/diet-nutrition/diet/dragon-fruit-how-eat-benefits-taste-more/) - Lemon Is There Sugar in Kombucha? Although some brands of kombucha have very little sugar in their products, some manufacturers add flavor, juice, and higher amounts of sugar during the preparation stage, for taste and sweetness. There aren't specific guidelines on how much sugar is too much in a bottle of kombucha, so you'll have to use your discretion. Yet [Casey Seiden, RD](https://www.caseyseidennutrition.com/meetcasey), a registered dietitian who is based in New York City, encourages consumers to look at drinks like kombucha in the context of their added sugar intake throughout the day. \"If you've already guzzled another sugary drink and had extra sweets, then perhaps limit yourself to one kombucha,\" she warns. The American Heart Association recommends consuming no more than 6 teaspoons (tsp), which is equal to 25 grams or 100 calories of added sugar per day for women. Men are allowed a bit more \u2014 about 9 tsps, which is equal to 36 g or 150 calories of added sugar per day. ( [20](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sugar/how-much-sugar-is-too-much)) Is There Alcohol in Kombucha? \"Many people are also concerned about the alcohol content of kombucha, but those worries are not completely warranted,\" Seiden says. \"Kombucha contains about 0.5 percent alcohol by volume, compared with a beer, which has 5 percent, so it's certainly not going to get anybody drunk.\" That said, it's not recommended for children or pregnant women, in addition to anyone with liver, renal, or pulmonary disease. ( [21](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047279718307385)) A Final Word on Kombucha Benefits There's limited research confirming the health benefits of kombucha. (3) But the drink has increased in popularity, with many people using it to improve their gut health and relieve other conditions, like depression, constipation, and inflammation. (2) Although it is popular, kombucha isn't for everyone. If you're pregnant, take medication, or have an existing medical condition, talk to your doctor to make sure kombucha is safe for you.
