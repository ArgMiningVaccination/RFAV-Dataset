After practicing many years ago and then more recently starting up again, I can unequivocally state that when I do practice meditating, I feel various benefits. The more frequently, and the longer the sessions, if I can \"double-up\" or find more opportunities (such as vicariously, while teaching others to meditate), the more benefits I accrue. I told this audience in previous articles that I was a \"wild child\" with lots of energy. Meditation literally calmed me down enough to pay attention (somewhat in school. I would have gotten in a lot more trouble if I had not meditated in high school and in college. Today, I am still very energetic for my age, so my ADD manifests itself in different ways. As an adult, I need to contain and constrain myself from various things, such as: staying up too late, having too high an energy for clients, expending too much energy on certain tasks or projects, not interrupting in conversation, not jumping up all the time to do something, not being too overly distracted with my phone and other electronic devices, and more! The last one is probably the key to all the others on the list. Many of us (digital users) are 'magnetized' to our phones. Whether we need them or not, we're holding them, fiddling with them, looking for something on them even if not \"notified.\" Our devices accompany us wherever we are...sometimes in very inappropriate places. We look at them when we don't need to, we might even have a 'phantom sound' or sensation alerting us to a \"non-notation.\" Looking at our phones, we daze out or phase out, not present during even live, in-person conversations. These devices can be a blessing or a curse, depending on how we utilize them. Ironically, even though they may actually house the apps or relaxation recordings or meditations, they have the potential to undo what meditation or concentrated focus does. As the Torah teaches us, each great thing has the potential for its opposite as well.
