Individual Responsibilities The Chief of Service and other attending staff are responsible for monitoring care provided by the resident staff. The Chief of Service provides the required reports. Attending faculty supervise house staff in such a way that the house staff assume progressively increasing responsibility for patient care according to their level of training ability and experience. Role, rResponsibility, and patient care activities of the house staff: The house staff have primary responsibility for the clinical care of patients on the wards, in the clinic, and in the operating room under the supervision of attending staff . It is the goal of the program to have the residents develop a formal therapeutic relationship with the patients and to have patients identify the housestaff as the primary care provider. This includes initial history and physical exams, medical test decision making, procedures, and analysis of care options and therapeutic interventions. This educational environment is consistently monitored by the real-time presence of the attending staff who closely monitor and supervise house staff interactions and decision making. It should be remembered that the house staff are all eligible for California State Licensure to practice independently as physicians and surgeons in the state of California by having completed ACGME approved surgical internships. The attending staff and program director make decisions about the extent to which the resident can practice independently by analyzing a variety of factors including in-service scores, home study course scores, rotation evaluations, semi- annual formal performance evaluations, ABO surgical experience data, and also by direct, daily contact and observation. Resident Evaluation Process: the residents are evaluated in accordance with ACGME requirements for Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery. The residents participate in Grand Rounds, Morbidity and Mortality conference, regularly scheduled didactic lectures, journal clubs, text book chapter readings, the Home Study Course, the annual in- service examination, and individual rotation evaluations on the MedHub system in accordance with Graduate Medical Education Committee guidelines. American Board of Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery surgical experience reports are examined semi-annually in formal reviews with the Program Director and Chair. Clinical comments and evaluation are made to the house staff on a daily basis by the attending staff and Chief of Service.
