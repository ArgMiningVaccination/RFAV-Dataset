Naturopathic physicians obtain comprehensive training in both the medical sciences and various disciplines of alternative medicine at a four-year medical school. They provide both routine medical care and address chronic health problems in way that supports the whole person. What is Naturopathic Medicine? The modern practice of Naturopathic medicine is based upon both on traditional methods of healing and cutting edge scientific research. Typical Naturopathic treatments include nutritional and lifestyle counseling, herbal medicine, homeopathy, therapeutic use of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and essential fatty acids, physiotherapy, spinal manipulation, mind-body medicine, and occasionally pharmaceutical drugs. Whenever possible Naturopathic doctors use supportive and non-suppressive treatments in order to allow the body to naturally heal. When appropriate, nutritional supplements may be used in the place of pharmaceutical drugs to control symptoms with fewer side effects. Six principles explain the Naturopathic approach: - Vis Medicatrix Naturae- The Healing Power of Nature - Treat the Whole Person - Primum Non Nocere- First Do No Harm - Tolle Causm- Identify and Treat the Cause - Prevention is the Best Cure - Docere- Doctor as Teacher The American Association of Naturopathic Physicians has defined the practice of Naturopathic medicine as follows: Naturopathic medicine is a distinct method of primary care- an art, science, philosophy and practice of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of illness The goal of Naturopathic medical treatment is to restore and maintain optimal health.
