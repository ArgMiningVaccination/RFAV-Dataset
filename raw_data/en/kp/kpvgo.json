For those times, when you need additional, fast-acting immune support, Dr. Cabral personally takes and recommends Rapid Immune Boost from Herb Pharm. Supports a healthy immune response Provides a broad spectrum of plant compounds Gluten-Free and Non-GMO Rapid Immune Boost supports a quick, vigorous response to immune system distress. The Rapid Immune Boost formula contains a powerful blend of immune-supporting herbal Echinacea extracted from the Certified Organic root of Echinacea purpurea plants grown only on Herb Pharm's own farms in southern Oregon. It also includes Goldenseal made from Certified Organic Hydrastis canadensisrhizome and rootlet. Herb Pharm only uses cultivated Goldenseal in order to preserve wild-growing populations of this threatened plant. The herbs in this formula are individually extracted to provide a broad-spectrum of plant compounds. Additionally, Herb Pharm assures herb identity via macroscopic and organoleptic analysis, then confirm it through methods such as HPTLC fingerprinting specific to each herb. The formula is easily dispensed, taken in liquid form and added to water or other liquid. Rapid Immune Boost from Herb Pharm is: Black Indigo, Santa, Organic Cane Alcohol, Distilled Water, Organic Vegetable Glycerin Shake Well Before Using. Add 1 full squeeze of the dropper bulb to 2 oz. of water or juice, 2 to 5 times per day. Best taken between meals. Take prior to travel or for the first sign of oncoming sickness. Seek expert medical advice before taking during pregnancy or nursing. Keep out of the reach of children. Store away from heat and light. Every product on this website was formulated with the mindset that my family and I would be using each nutritional supplement. When you go into a product formulation knowing that your own family and children will use these products it ensures there will never be any compromise... Plus, I want only the best for my online community and private practice clients. And, since people come to me for results after failing many times in the past, I have to know that every one of these products are truly the best of the best and will help people on their healing journey... It's important to understand that not all nutritional supplements are created equal. For example, in a Functional Medicine practice only methylated or highly bio-available vitamins and minerals will be used in order to make it easy for the body to utilize. Not only do these formula get better results, but they do not build up as toxins in the body or simply get excreted in the urine like most cheaper forms... I made a promise to myself when I first started formulating the EquiLife line that I would not compromise on quality... Even if a product cost me a few more dollars, I would not take any shortcuts in order to make a product for less. This has enabled EquiLife to set itself apart even in the Functional Medicine community as a leader in the best ingredients used. Besides never compromising on using the highest quality ingredients available when formulating our nutritional supplements, I make sure that each batch is 3rd Party tested for contaminants like: This then allows me to be confident when consuming these products myself and knowing that the dosages are what is stated on the bottle. Again, this leads to better user results and happier customers and wellness clients! Another way in which the Equilibrium Nutrition supplement line sets itself apart as the leader in the industry is by always producing fresh orders every couple of months. Our products do not sit in warehouses for over a year... Instead we maintain freshness with smaller continuous batch orders along with climate controlled fulfillment centers. This guarantees purity, freshness, and taste. This is a difference you can both see and taste with every bottle! At EquiLife we strive to provide the fastest and most convenient shipping available! Since I know you're going to absolutely love and see & feel the difference by using the Equi.Life supplement line I've formulated for my private practice, my family, and online community I'm happy to offer you my \"Empty Bottle Guarantee!\" This means if you don't see or feel the results you were looking for, or just don't believe this was the absolute best product in its class that you've ever used, simply ship back the empty bottles, within 60 days of your purchase, for 100% of your product purchase price (not including S&H). My team and I firmly believe in putting our clients and customers first, and we only want the best for you in your wellness, weight loss & anti-aging goals! Bought this product for the Mold Protocal for my son. Very helpful when you are feeling down I took this along with oregano oil at the first signs of a cold and I believe it helped with the duration and severity of it. love it, great for this time of year to prepare your immune system!
