Recent evidence indicates the critical role of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway in antitumor immunity. STING-targeted activation is extensively investigated as a new strategy for cancer therapy. Previously, we reported a safe and ecacious STING-activating nanovaccine to boost systemic tumor-speci c T cell re- sponses in multiple tumor models. Local radiotherapy has been reported to not only reduce tumor burden butalso enhance local antitumor immunity in a STING-dependent manner. In this study, we demonstrate that combination of these two modalities leads to a synergistic response with long-term regression of large estab- lished tumors in two mouse tumor models. The percentage of CD8 +T cells increased signi cantly in primary tumors after combination therapy. Mechanistically, the augmented T cell responses of radiotherapy and nano- vaccine is STING pathway dependent. Furthermore, nanovaccine synergizes with radiotherapy to achieve a better therapeutic e ect in distal tumors. These ndings suggest that combination of local radiotherapy with systemic PC7A nanovaccine o ers a useful strategy to improve the therapeutic outcome of late stage solid cancers. 1. Introduction Stimulation of innate immune pathways plays an important role in T cell production and tumor in ltration [ 1]. Among various innate pathways, stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is emerging as a un- ique mediator protein for host defense. STING exists in many cell types, including all antigen-presenting cells, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, andbroblasts [ 2], which provide a broad platform for e ective innate stimulation. Activation of the STING pathway upregulates the tran-scription of genes that encode type I interferons (IFNs) and proin- flammatory cytokines and chemokines. STING activation in tumor tis- sues can lead to accumulation and in ltration of CD8+ T cells. Recent studies show after tumor cell inoculation in STING-de cient mice, tu- mors grew more in wild-type or TRIF-de cient mice. CD8 +T cells against tumors were also defective in mice lacking STING, butnot in those lacking Toll like receptor, myeloid di erentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) or mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), suggesting the essential role of STING in antitumor immunity [3]. We previously reported a synthetic polymeric nanoparticle, PC7A NP, which generated a robust cancer-speci c T cell response with low systemic cytokine expression [ 4]. Antigen-loaded PC7A NP was sys- by to target the lym- phoid organs. The nanoparticle formulation (20 -30 nm in diameter) allowed e cient cytosolic delivery of tumor antigens to the dendritic cells inside draining lymph nodes, while stimulating the innate pathway for T cell activation. T cell activation is exclusively dependent on STING, but not on TLR or MAVS pathways.

Tillustrated e cacious anti-tumor response in multiple mouse tumor models, including B16 melanoma, MC38 colon carcinoma, and TC-1 cervical tumors. Despite the therapeutic promise, tumor resistance to PC7A nanovaccine is observed in established tumors (e.g., > 100 mm3). Combination of other therapeutic modalities with PC7A nanovaccinemay prove necessary in the eradication of large, immunosuppresive tumors. Radiotherapy (RT) is widely used in the treatment of various solid tumors. Increasing evidence has shown that local radiation not only reduce tumor burden [ 5,6], but also augment adaptive T cell response against tumors [ 7,8]. Deng et al. reported that ionizing radiation pro- duces a type I IFN-dependent antitumor response via the STING pathway. The DNA of dying irradiated cancer cells are found in the cytoplasm of dendritic cells, which is responsible for the activation of the cGAS-STING-type I IFN pathway [ 9]. Direct activation of STING by intra-tumoral injection of STING agonists also led to potent immuneresponses and systemic tumor regression [ 10]. Therefore, targeting the STING pathway in tumors o ers an e ective strategy to enhance adaptive antitumor immunity. In this study, we investigated the synergy between the systemic cancer-speci c T cell response initiated by STING-activating PC7A na- novaccine, and local STING activation by ionizing radiation for in-creased T cell in ltration in tumors. The combined STING activation strategy produced a synergistic therapeutic outcome against large, es-tablished tumors compared to either treatment alone. STING-de cient mice treated with the same strategy showed signi cantly less CD8 +T cells both systemically and locally in the tumor. In addition to the re- sponse seen in the primary irradiated tumors, we also observed an abscopal e ect from this combination, which is rarely found in patients treated with radiotherapy alone. These data suggest combining PC7Ananovaccine with local radiation o ers a useful strategy in treating both primary and metastatic cancers. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Chemicals Antigenic peptides E7 43-62 (GQAEPDRAHYNIVTFCCKCD), OVA Fetal bovine serum, penicillin streptomycin, and cell culture media were obtained from Invitrogen Inc. (OR, USA). Amicon ultra-15 centrifugal lter tubes (MWCO = 100 K) were from Millipore. Other solvents and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or FisherScienti c Inc. 11,12]. PEG- b-PC7A copolymer was synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) method [ 13]. Micelles were prepared following a solvent eva- poration method [ 12]. Brie fly, 10 mg of PEG- b-PC7A copolymer was rst dissolved in 1 mL methanol and then added into 4 mL distilled water dropwise under sonication. The mixture was ltered 4 times to remove methanol using the micro-ultra ltration system (MW = 100 KD). Then distilled water was added to adjust the polymer concentra-tion to 10 mg/mL as a stock solution. After micelle formation, the na- noparticles were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS, Mal- vern ZetaSizer model) for hydrodynamic diameter (Dh) measurement. 2.3. Animals and cells All animal procedures were performed with ethical compliance and approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Female C57BL/6 mice (6 -8 weeks) were obtained from the University of TexasSouthwestern breeding core. STING mut/mutmice were purchased from the Jackson laboratory. B16-OVA cells were kindly provided by Dr. Patrick Hwu at MD Anderson Cancer Center and TC-1 cells by Dr. T. C. Wu at John Hopkins University. Both cell lines were routinely tested using mycoplasma contamination kit (R&D). Cells were cultured in DMEM medium (10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin G so- dium and 100 g/mL (Pen/Strep), non-essential amino acids, at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO 2and the normal level of O 2. 2.4. Tumor inoculation and treatment Six to eight week old mice ( n=5 -10 for each group) were injected subcutaneously with B16-OVA (1.5 \u00d7 105), or TC-1 cells (1.5 \u00d7 105) into the right flank of mice. Tumors were treated by local radiation as described previously [ 9]. Animals were immunized with subcutaneous injection at the tail base (0.5 g per antigen peptide, PC7A NP 30 g). The tumor growth was subsequently measured twice a week using adigital caliper and tumor size was calculated as 0.5 \u00d7 length\u00d7width 2 by blinded investigators. Mice were sacri ced when tumor size reached 1500 mm3. For cell depletion experiments, 250 g administeredfour times by i.p. injection every 3 days per mouse. 2.5. Flow cytometry analysis For CD8 +T cell and Tetramer+cell analyses, tumor tissues were digested by 1 mg/mL collagenase IV (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.2 mg/mL DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich) for 45 min at 37 \u00b0C. were then BD LSR II flow cytometer or CytoFLEX (Beckman Coulter, Inc) and analyzed with FlowJo (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR) orCytExpert (Beckman Coulter, Inc) software. 2.6. Histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) of tumor tissues Tissues were xed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 -3 days and sent to university histology core for para n sectioning. Para n sections nized and rehydrated with xylene and serial dilutions of ethanol followed by antigen retrieval with 1\u00d7 Tris-EDTA in 10% gly- cerol bu er (pH blocked by 5% bovine serum al- bumin in Tris Bu er Solution plus Tween with primary rabbit monoclonal anti-mouse CD8 (11000) (98941S, Cell Signaling Technology) in blocking solution at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Then slides were washed and incubated for 45 with horseradish perox- idase (HRP)-conjugated goat was developed with 3,3 Diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate and the slides were nally counterstained with hematoxylin. 2.7. Statistical analysis Based on pilot immunization and tumor treatment studies, we used group sizes of 3- 6 animals/group for immunogenicity measurements and 5 animals/group for tumor therapy experiments. Statistical analysiswas performed using Microsoft Excel and Prism 5.0 (GraphPad). Data are expressed as means \u00b1 s.e.m. Data were analyzed by Student's t-test.

Results 3.1. Established tumors develop resistance to PC7A nanovaccine We previously demonstrated that STING-activating PC7A nano- vaccine generated potent tumor-speci c T cell responses in several mouse tumor models [ 4]. However, the dependence of antitumor e - cacy of the vaccine therapy on the di erent size and stage of tumor development is not clear. To address this question, we immunized mice at several time points after TC-1 tumor cell inoculation. When micewere immunized with E7 43-62-PC7A vaccine 5 days after tumor cell inoculation, 70% of mice showed complete regression 2 weeks aftervaccination, and 60% mice showed tumor free survival 60 days after tumor inoculation ( Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 1). In contrast, when mice were immunized on day 10 after tumor cell inoculation, the tu-mors were well-established (about 100- 200 mm 3). The tumors showed some shrinkage a week after the rst vaccination, but the e ect was not adequate to reject the tumors, which nally recurred a month later. When mice were immunized 13 days after tumor cell inoculation, thisgroup showed continuous tumor growth and shorter life span compared to the other two groups. At the same time, CD8 +T cells in tumors at dierent time points after tumor inoculation were examined. Results showed that larger tumors contained lower percentage of T cells (Supplementary Fig. 2A), and PD-L1 was expressed on tumor cells and several subtypes of myeloid cells over isotype control [ 4].These data illustrate that larger tumors develop immunosuppressive mechanismand become resistant to nanovaccine therapy. From our previous re- port, after injection of fluorescence labeled nanoparticles, antigen presenting cells at draining lymph nodes and injection site especiallyDCs were the major cell population that took up PC7A NPs and sub- sequently activated STING-type I IFN pathway [ 4]. During this process, nofluorescence signal was detected in tumors (Supplementary Fig. 2B), which suggests the antitumor e cacy was mostly due to T cell acti- vation in lymphoid organs. In cell depletion e cacy, but not NK cell depletion (Supplementary Fig. 2C, D). These data sug-gest that T cells induced by nanovaccine in the lymphatic system played a major role in tumor growth inhibition.3.2. Radiation synergizes with nanovaccine to e ectively control established tumors To investigate whether local radiation can help overcome tumor resistance to PC7A vaccine, we employed established TC-1 tumors inC57BL/6 mice with tumor size reaching ~200 mm 3(in about 13 days after inoculation). Based on previous reports, T lymphocytes are highlysensitive to ionizing radiation and can be cleared rapidly from the ra- diation site [ 14,15], so in the combination group, mice rst received a single dose of 20 Gy local radiation, followed by subcutaneous injectionof PC7A nanovaccine, with a boost 7 days post initial vaccination (Fig. 2A). Nanovaccine alone and radiation alone were used as controls to assess the e ect of monotherapy. The result showed that radiation alone and nanovacccine alone deterred the tumor growth marginallycompared with the E7 peptide only control, but were unable to suppress eventual tumor growth. In contrast, combination of nanovaccine and radiation therapy showed signi cant therapeutic synergy over either monotherapy alone, as 50% of mice were tumor-free 60 days aftertumor inoculation ( Fig. were rechallenged with 1 \u00d7 10 6TC-1 tumor cells (Supplementary Fig. 3E), and animals showed long-term memory to reject the trans- planted tumors, whereas tumors grew robustly in na\u00efve mice. This synergistic e ect was also evaluated in B16-OVA melanoma tumor model. After the tumor size reached 70 mm3(about 10 days after inoculation), the mice received a single dose of 20 Gy local radiation.Nanovaccine containing OVA peptide was subcutaneously administered immediately post-radiation, with two boost shots 5 and 10 days post initial vaccine treatment ( Fig. 2D). This combination also showed ob- vious synergy e ect over single therapy, as 40% mice were tumor-free 60 days after tumor inoculation ( Fig. 2E and F). These results demon- strate great therapeutic synergy in systemic PC7A vaccine and localradiation therapy. 3.3. STING pathway is required for the therapeutic synergy of combination therapy Since either PC7A nanovaccine or local radiation were shown to depend on STING pathway for antitumor immunity, we sought to de- termine the role of STING in the combination strategy. We rst de- termined the ratio of tumor-in ltrating T cells over cancer cells from various treatment groups. Tumor tissues were removed for analysis Fig. 1.

Tumor tissues were dissociated into single cells by collagenase treatment. Flow cytometry was then utilized to detect the percentage of inltrating T cells (Supplementary Fig. 4). The results show that com- pared to non-treated WT mice, both radiation alone and vaccine alonetreatment increased tumor in ltrating T cells (CD45 +CD3+cells) and antigen-speci c CD8+T cells (E7 tetramer+CD8+CD3+cells).Moreover, combination of radiation and vaccine treatment results insignicant increase of both T cell populations over single arm controls, demonstrating clear therapeutic synergy ( Fig. 3A -B).

Journal of Controlled Release 300 (2019) 154-160 157the wild type animals ( Fig. 3 A-B), which is consistent with our previous reports [ 4,9]. For the combination therapy group, compared to wild type mice, STING mutant mice showed signi cantly decreased lym- phocytes in tumor after treatments ( P< .01). Furthermore, we used immunohistochemistry assay to detect the percentage of CD8+T cell inltration into the tumors ( Fig. 4C). In wild type mice, a higher per- centage of tumor-in ltrating CD8+T cells were detected compared to STING mutant mice after combination therapy. To further corroborate thesendings, we evaluated the systemic T cell activation 9 days after radiation and the rst dose of vaccine in both wild type and STING mutant mice ( Fig. 4). Spleens were removed and dissociated into single cells for flow cytometry analysis (Supplementary Fig. 5). The treated group showed distinctive increase of E7-speci c T cells in CD8+T cell population compared to the untreated group and STING mutant group (Fig. 4B -C). These experiments demonstrate that STING pathway is required for both elevated systemic T cell response and local tumorinltration in the combination therapy. 3.4. Local radiation synergizes with PC7A nanovaccine to control distal tumors Ionizing radiation has been reported to reduce tumor growth out- side the treatment eld in rare clinical cases, referred to as the abscopal eect [16,17]. Enhancement of the abscopal e ect has great promise in treatment of patients with metastatic tumors. Historically, preclinicalevidence has supported the notion that distal tumor (metastatic tumor) regression as a result of radiation is immune-mediated [ 18-20]. In this study, we used the dual TC-1 tumor model to test the abscopal e ect. Primary tumors were rst initiated by subcutaneous injection of cells (1.5 \u00d7 10 5cells) on the left flanks of mice, and 4 days later, distal tu- mors (2 \u00d7 104cells) were introduced on the right flanks ( Fig. 5A). In the untreated control group, distal tumors grew both later and smaller than the primary tumors (Supplementary Fig. 6A), resembling metastatic tumor nodules in patients. When primary tumor size reached ~200 mm3(in about 13 days), mice received a single dose of 20 Gy local radiation on primary side and PC7A vaccine subcutaneously. We measured tumor growth on both the primary and distal tumors. Results show radiation alone was e ective at inhibiting the growth of the ir- radiated primary tumor ( Fig. 5B), but it had no e ect on distal tumors compared to non-treated group. PC7A nanovaccine alone showed in- creased inhibitory e ect on distal tumors over the non-treated control,and combination of both nanovaccine and radiation achieved growth inhibition in distal tumors ( Fig. 5C- D, Supplementary Fig. 6B). These results illustrate radiation alone failed to prime a dur-able immune response to attack distal TC-1 tumors, but combination with STING vaccine led to a signi cant improvement in systemic T cell response against distal tumors. 4. Discussion Therapeutic vaccines are designed to harness the immune system to induce potent tumor-speci c cytotoxic T cells for cancer im- munotherapy. New trends in therapeutic cancer vaccines focus on the mode of antigen delivery and the type of immune-stimulating adjuvants [21-23]. Our PC7A nanovaccine allowed stable antigen loading within a small size con nement (< 50 nm) that facilitates antigen delivery to the lymph nodes. So this nanovaccine platform can be rapidly adopted to incorporate many existing tumor-associated antigens as well as tumor neoantigens. Equally important, early endosomal release of tumor antigens into the cytosol avoids lysosomal degradation, leading to increased antigen cross-presentation on the cell surface. Uniquely, this synthetic nanoparticle itself stimulated innate cellular immunity through the STING-type I IFN pathway, which induced a long term anti- tumor response. Compared to several established adjuvants (CpG, polyI:C and Alum), PC7A NP was able to induce better T cell response and anti-tumor e cacy with lower systemic cytokine expressions[ 4]. In large, established tumors, this vaccine showed decreased antitumorecacy. Historically, clinical trial outcomes of many cancer vaccines have also been disappointing [ 24-27] with similar limitations in treating late stage tumors. Therefore, developing strategies to reduce tumor burden and overcome resistance of established tumors to cancer vaccines has the potential to improve the clinical result of therapeutic vaccines. Tumor radiation can rapidly reduce tumor burden without directly suppressing vaccine-induced systemic T cell responses. Increasing evi- dence shows that radiation can augment adaptive T cell responses totumors [ 7,8]. First, radiation can damage the tumor tissue and re- organize tumor-associated blood vessels, which presumably allows forbetter T cell or cytokine penetration [ 28,29]. Second, it has been shown that the therapeutic e ect of ablative radiation therapy depends largely on CD8 +T cells, as radiation increases T cell priming [ 30]. Further- more, local radiation induces antigen release and cross-presentation Fig. 4. STING pathway is required for systemic T cell activation of combination therapy.

Journal of Controlled Release 300 (2019) 154-160 158mainly through STING-Type I IFNs pathway [ 20]. Previous reports showed that only antigens released by dead tumor cells were not suf- cient to stimulate T cell activation. Under non-in flammatory condi- tions, these dead cells failed to induce antitumor immune responses[31]. Radiation not only induces antigens' release from tumor cells, but also triggers innate sensing, stimulates and attracts antigen-presentingcells (APCs) to uptake and present tumor antigens, as well as increases expression of co-stimulators, nally activates tumor speci c T cell re- sponse. Among di erent innate sensing pathways that modulate tumor inflammation, it has been shown that STING-type I IFNs were required for radiation-induced in flammation and subsequent adaptive immune responses [ 3,9]. Due to the increasing recognition of the importance of STING pathway in T cell priming and anti-tumor e ects, we combined our nanovaccine with local ionizing radiation to synergize STINGfunction in both the lymphatic system and tumor site. This combination showed an obvious synergy e ect in established tumor models. In STING mutant mice, the T cell response produced by this combinationwas markedly decreased, indicating that the STING pathway and sub- sequent pro-in flammatory cytokines expressed in the tumor are crucial for allowing T cells to home to tumors and attack. Our data show en-couraging antitumor e cacy in relatively large tumors by combining radiation and vaccine therapy. Kelly et al. reported using a combinationof four immunotherapeutic agents to eliminate large tumor burdens[32]. Inclusion of additional agents that target independent immune suppressive mechanisms (e.g., anti-PD-1 or PD-L1) may be bene cial to augment the antitumor response in the current regimen. In this study, we further investigated the combination therapy on distal tumors, and observed that distal tumors displayed a similar sy-nergistic response to the combined treatments as the primary tumors, but were more resistant. In several mice, while the primary large tu- mors showed obvious regression after treatment, the distal tumor still persisted and eventually grew ( Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 6), as reported in similar studies [ 33]. One possible explanation for this di- minished response might be the intact immunosuppressive environment of the distal tumors (i.e., without radiation-induced infl ammation). Another possibility is the attraction of more circulating T cells to the primary tumor site, which resulted in fewer T cells accumulating in the distal tumor. Further work is necessary to elucidate the mechanism of vaccine resistance in distal tumors to achieve optimal abscopal e ect. 5. Conclusions We previously reported a STING-activating nanovaccine to elicit a robust T cell response against multiple tumor types. In this study, wecombined the nanovaccine with radiation therapy to treat large, es- tablished solid tumors. The combination regimen showed a synergistic Fig. 5.

Mechanistically, local ra- diation e ectively reduced the tumor burden and reverted im- munosuppressive environment through the activation of STING pathway. The spatial orchestration of STING activation, systemically through the PC7A nanovaccine and locally by tumor radiation, resulted in signi cantly improved tumor growth inhibition and long-term and B16-OVA tumor-bearing mice. The antitumor e cacy was greatly diminished in STING mutant mice. Results from this study indicate the importance of synergizing STING activation of the lym- phoid organs and solid tumors for cancer immunotherapy.
