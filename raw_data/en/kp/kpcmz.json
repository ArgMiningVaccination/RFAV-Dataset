It was [devised](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/devised) before 2500 bce in China and by the late 20th century was used in many other areas of the world. Acupuncture consists of the insertion of one or several small metal needles into the skin and underlying tissues at precise points on the body. Acupuncture grew out of ancient [Chinese philosophy's](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Chinese-philosophy) dualistic cosmic theory of the [yin and the yang](https://www.britannica.com/topic/yinyang). The yin, the female principle, is passive and dark and is represented by the earth; the yang, the male principle, is active and light and is represented by the heavens. The forces of yin and yang act in the [human body](https://www.britannica.com/science/human-body) as they do throughout the natural universe as a whole. Disease or physical disharmony is caused by an imbalance or undue preponderance of these two forces in the body, and the goal of Chinese [medicine](https://www.britannica.com/science/medicine) is to bring the yin and the yang back into balance with each other, thus restoring the person to health. An imbalance of yin and yang results in an obstruction of the life force, or [qi](https://www.britannica.com/topic/qi-Chinese-philosophy), in the body. Qi flows through 12 meridians, or pathways, in the body, each in turn associated with a major [visceral](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/visceral) organ (liver, kidney, etc.) and with a functional body system. Acupuncture is designed to affect the distribution of yin and yang in these channels so that the qi will be enabled to flow freely and harmoniously. The actual practice of acupuncture consists of inserting [needles](https://www.britannica.com/technology/needle-tool) into any of hundreds of points located over the 12 basic meridians and over a number of specialized meridians. The needles used may be slightly arrowheaded or may have extremely fine points. The typical insertion is 3 to 10 mm (0.1 to 0.4 inch) in depth; some procedures call for insertions up to almost 25 cm (10 inches). Once inserted, a needle may be twisted, twirled, or connected to a low-voltage [alternating current](https://www.britannica.com/science/alternating-current) for the [duration](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/duration) of its use. The physician frequently inserts needles at a considerable distance from the point on which they are to act; for example, a needle inserted into the pad of the thumb is expected to produce analgesia in the [abdomen](https://www.britannica.com/science/abdomen). Similarly, successive points on a specific meridian may affect widely different areas or conditions; e.g., the first six points of the yin lung meridian deal primarily with swollen joints, excessive heat in joints, bleeding of the nose, [heart](https://www.britannica.com/science/heart) pains, [mental depression](https://www.britannica.com/science/depression-psychology), and inability to stretch the arms above the head. The location of the points is mastered by the use of innumerable diagrams and models. There is [speculation](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/speculation) that acupuncture can relieve pain, including to the extent that it can act as an [anesthetic](https://www.britannica.com/science/anesthetic) during [surgery](https://www.britannica.com/science/surgery-medicine). Evidence to support this notion, however, is lacking. [The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica](/editor/The-Editors-of-Encyclopaedia-Britannica/4419)This article was most recently "}
