I received the first vaccination Covishield on March 6 2021. I am sharing my experience of cure from immune response to Covid vaccination using Ayurveda medicine. In the process of sharing my experience, am sharing a few details only with the intention to help and benefit any other patient similarly placed. I had been to hospital to meet a Covid Positive relative on the 17 th April, due to the confidence that I was already vaccinated. However I got into self-quarantine at home from 17 th April 2021 itself following Doctor's advice. Even though the doctor suggested quarantining only for 3 or 4 days, I continued to be in self-quarantine for 14 days and beyond. In the meanwhile, I received the second vaccination shot of Covishield on the April 24 th 2021. Continuing in home isolation, I felt absolutely no symptoms till April 27 th 2021 midnight when I felt feverish, shivering with profuse dry cough. Covid patients in Bengaluru were already struggling for oxygen, ICU, bed an alarming and frightening situation. Immune response to Covid vaccine My Covid RTPCR test result dated 29 th April 2021 showed negative. But even then I was getting feverish with persistent dry cough. Upon consultation of my family Dr Mandakini, I was told that my symptoms such as fever and dry cough are in fact an immune response to the Covid vaccination Covishield as I completed both vaccination doses by April 24 2021. Reason being, my blood reports indicated no signs of infection but showed high inflammation indicated by C -Reactive Protein 22mg/L ; D DIMER 528.1 ng/ml, ESR(Modified Westergren Method 31 mm/hour. My Oxygen levels were fluctuating between 94 and 95 with feverish temperature (Table), but with persistent dry cough all through from the very first day of 28 th April 2021, which was certainly frightening. The family doctor indicated that for inflammation cortico steroids will be prescribed along with blood thinner for heart health. As I was insisting that I will prefer Ayurveda medicines for treatment, my family doctor got in touch with the well-known Ayurveda physician Dr Lalitha Vamadevacharya (9481400586) in Bengaluru, who prescribed medications in Ayurveda along with strict pathya. Ayurveda medicine for Covid The Ayurveda medicines prescribed were 1. Sitophaladi churna (quarter spoon) with two or three drops of honey, once every 3 hours (ie 8 doses per day; 2. Trishun 1 tablet at morning and night, 3. Samathva 1 tablet at morning and night and 4. Kalamegha 1 spoon morning and night. I have already been taking one Arjin tablet for BP and heart health. I also learnt Arjin also acted as a thinner. Occasionally whenever the dry cough went out of control, I was advised to have 3 spoons of Kofol syrup. In the process of duration, I was given no fruits, no heavy food (except pepper sambar and rice) The above medicines and periodic monitoring of the oxygen and temperature levels, periodic reporting to the Ayurveda Doctor and constant advise in medicine and in food, resulted in returning to normalcy in temperature in about ten days. Dry cough which persisted is now under control. Friends and relatives constantly used to advise to take at least paracetamol for fever which was also avoided due to my trust in Ayurveda medicine and the experienced Dr Lalitha. Insulin dependency after Covid medication By this time I had also learnt about a few Covid cases where upon having admitted to hospital and come out cured with negative covid result, but then some of the patients had become insulin dependent after treatment with Covid. This was also reason, I preferred to take Ayurveda medicine to treat covid. Thus, the Covid immune response symptoms were taken care of only by Ayurveda medicines and the pathya (food). Sitophaladi, the wonder Ayurveda expectorant My curiosity with Ayurveda medicine Sitophaladi churna in curing persistent dry cough due to Covid immune response lead to interesting information that Sitopaladi churna is made from white part of bamboo tree, pepper, cardamom and cinnamon. This medicine aims at curing respiratory diseases by restoring lung capacity, improving pulmonary performance and immunity. Further learnt that Sitophaladi churna is used to fight flue, chest congestion and respiratory problems like pheumonia, bronchitis, TB. The expectorant loosens the phlegm and the anti-inflammatory property treats respiratory diseases, with the ability to soothe a cough. Ayurveda medicine, never to be branded as slow action There is an informal tendency to brand Ayurveda medicines as slow action and not so effective in emergency situations. However, it is crucial to realize that as I was taking lone Ayurveda tablet Arjin for BP, it also served as blood thinner according to the Allopathic doctor. Therefore it is crucial to appreciate that Ayurveda has effective medicines on par with allopathy for different ailments. For me, getting cured in ten days of home isolation with Ayurveda medicine was much better than the same ten days of hospitalization with cortico steroids and paracetomol compromising immunity. Therefore it is crucial to appreciate the usefulness of Ayurveda medicines and use the same for curing different ailments. Disclaimer Views expressed above are the author's own. "}
