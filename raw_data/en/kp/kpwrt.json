The Committeewas asked to assess the toxicological properties of selected BFRs in orderto advise on any health implications of the estimates of dietary exposure. Background 7.2 Brominated flame-retardants (BFRs) are structurally diverse chemicals used in plastics, textiles and other materials to enhance their flame-retardant properties. Some BFRs, including polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs) and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) are mixed intopolymers rather than being chemically bound to them and can leach out ofthe products/materials in which they are used and into the environment. 7.3 PBDEs are produced by direct bromination of diphenyl ether. There are 209 individual PBDE congeners, each of which is identifiable the UK. The commercial PBDEs are not pure products but a mixture ofvarious diphenyl ethers with varying degrees of bromination. 7.4 The actual composition of the commercial products varies with supplier and is considered to be commercially sensitive information. However,example compositions of PBDEs have been published (see Table 7.1).These figures are broadly representative of the commercial productsAdvice on fish consumption 145currently supplied. The commercial products are usually named on the basis of the principal PBDE congener e.g. pentaBDE. Trade-namenomenclature may also incorporate a number, which is related to theperformance characteristics (e.g. flame retardant properties) of thecommercial mixture rather than the constituent congeners 1. Table 7.1: Relative congener distribution for penta- and octaBDE 7.5 The commercial PBDEs have recently been evaluated under the EU Existing Substances Regulations. As a result of their potential tobioaccumulate in the environment, the EU has agreed to ban the marketingand use of penta- and octaBDE from 1 July 2004. However, for some timeafter this date there will still be existing PBDE-containing products in use. 7.6 There are limited data available on the potential of decaBDE to bioaccumulate in the environment and it is not currently included in theEU prohibition. In addition, it was not measured in the Skerne Teessurvey. However, information on decaBDE has been included in thisstatement for completeness and as a basis for future evaluations becausedecaBDE will be the only PBDE product commercially available when theban on penta- and octaBDE comes into force.

Figure 7.2. Chemical structure of HBCD Toxicology of PBDEs and HBCD 7.8 Completed EU risk assessments are available for pentaBDE1and octaBDE2, and draft risk assessments are available for decaBDE3and HBCD4. Unless otherwise indicated, the following summary is based on the information provided in these risk assessments. The COT alsoconsidered new studies published subsequent to the final literaturesearches for the EU risk assessments. A more detailed summary of thetoxicological data is available at http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/tox14.pdf. Throughout this statement the terms pentaBDE, octaBDE,decaBDE and HBCD refer to the commercial mixtures of brominatedflame-retardants whereas individual congeners are denoted by inclusion ofthe specific congener number e.g. PBDE-99. PBDEs 7.9 There is information on the toxicokinetics of penta-, octa- and decaBDE. Studies in laboratory animals have indicated that penta- andoctaBDE are absorbed following oral administration however, the extentof absorption is unknown 1,2. DecaBDE is not well absorbed after oral administration (<10%)3.124 5Br Br Br BrBr Br71012 11 9863Advice on fish consumption 1467.10 The primary route of excretion for all PBDEs is considered to be the faeces, although it is unclear how much of the PBDE present in the faecesrepresents unabsorbed material. In rats, following oral administration, themajority of pentaBDE was detected unchanged in the faeces 1. Limited information indicates that decaBDE is metabolized to lesser brominatedphenolic products 3. There is no information on the metabolism of octaBDE. Elimination of pentaBDE from rat adipose tissue is slow (t1/2 = 25-47 days) indicating that it has the potential for bioaccumulation1. There is no information on the elimination of octa- or decaBDE in animals,or on the bioaccumulation or the route of elimination of PBDEs in humans. 7.11 There is no information on PBDE levels in adipose tissue from the UK. However, PBDE-47 6'-hexaBDE) have beendetected in human breast adipose tissue in the US. The sum of totalPBDEs detected was 86 ng/g fat 5. PBDE-47 has also been detected in adipose tissue in Sweden (1.0-98.2 ng/g lipid)6. 7.12 In Sweden, there has been an increase in total PBDE levels in samples of human milk over a 25 year period from 1972-1997. The predominantcongener was PDBE-47 (2,2',4,4'-tetraBDE) which accounted for a further 8% of the total (0.46 ng/g lipid). The remaining17% was for by other tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexa congeners 7. Data from North America also indicate an increase in total PBDE levels inbreast milk. In 1992, samples of breast milk from the Canadian milk bankcontained less than 50 ng PBDE/g fat. In 1997, concentrations ofapproximately 150 ng PBDE/g fat were detected in samples from womenin New York State and 200 ng PBDE/g fat was detected in samples fromAustin and Denver in 2000 8. A recent abstract reported a mean concentration of total PBDE of 6.6 ng/g lipid in breast milk sampled fromwomen in the UK in 2001-3 9. 7.13 Repeat dose studies of commercial pentaBBDE in rodents have identified the liver as a key target organ, with effects seen at doses of 2 mg/kg bw/dayAdvice on fish consumption 147and greater. Based on a study in which a commercial pentaBDE product was administered to rats in the diet for 30-days (0-1 mg/kg bw/day) withno treatment related changes, the EU risk assessment concluded, the noobservable adverse effect level (NOAEL) for pentaBDE was 0.45 mg/kgbw/day 1. This value was derived based on the content of 50-62% pentaBDE in the commercial product and assuming a maximum oralabsorption of 90%, by analogy with other polyhalogenated diaromaticcompounds. Applying similar correction factors to the doses at which livertoxicity has been observed indicates a LOAEL of 0.9 mg/kg bw/day. 7.14 For octaBDE, a LOAEL of 7.2 mg/kg bw/day was identified for histopathological liver changes in the rat 2. A NOAEL for liver changes following administration of octaBDE has not been established. The repeatdose toxicity of decaBDE is low. The EU risk assessment reported aNOAEL of 1,120 mg/kg bw/day for liver changes seen in thecarcinogenicity study in rats (paragraph 19) 3. 7.15 In short term gavage studies in rats commercial mixtures of pentaBDE bw/day), to increase the metabolism of model substrates for drugmetabolising enzymes, in a manner consistent with of liver enlargement and histopathologicalchanges in the thyroid 1,10,11,12. DecaBDE was not found to induce a similar spectrum of changes in CYP subfamilies and thyroid hormones10,13. In this study the effect of decaBDE was investigated in rats at doses up 100mg/kg/day for 4 consecutive days. This dose is an order of magnitudebelow the LOAEL for lesions in the liver and thyroid in the carcinogenicitystudies and as such, may have been insufficient to produce an effect inshort-term studies. 7.16 Penta-BDE has not been shown to be mutagenic in four studies in S. typhimurium and one study in S. cerevisiae . A cytogenetic study in human peripheral blood lymphocytes also gave negative results. In a single studyin S. typhimurium , a commercial pentaBDE referred to as Tardex 50 (10-Advice on fish consumption 14810000 \u00b5g/plate) was shown to increase point mutations by 3-fold at the highest concentration in the absence, but not in the presence, of metabolicactivation. This single positive result was considered in the EU riskassessment to be a chance finding 1. PentaBDE has not been tested for genotoxicity in vivo . 7.17 Commercial octaBDE preparations were not mutagenic in four studies in S. typhimurium and one in S. cerevisiae in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. One preparation referred to as Muster 82 showedweak mutagenic activity in S. typhimurium without activation. No information is available on the composition of this preparation.Commercial octaBDE did not induce unscheduled DNA synthesis inhuman fibroblasts, sister chromatid exchange (SCE) in Chinese hamsterovary (CHO) cells or chromosomal aberrations in human peripheral bloodlymphocytes. OctaBDE has not been tested for genotoxicity in vivo 2. 7.18 Commercial decaBDE preparations of known purity (97-98%) were not mutagenic in S. typhimurium or E. coli in the presence and absence of rat metabolic activation. Two preparations referred to as Muster 83 andMuster 88 had positive effects in strains TA 98, 100 and 1535 with andwithout activation, but not in strains TA 1537 or 1538. No information isavailable on the composition of these preparations. In studies reported bythe NTP, decaBDE was not mutagenic in the anddid not induce SCE or chromosomal aberrations in CHO cells. In areproductive study with dietary administration of decaBDE (3-100mg/kg/day), there was no increase in chromosomal aberrations in the bonemarrow cells of parent rats or of the offspring at weaning 3. 7.19 There are no carcinogenicity data for pentaBDE and octaBDE. The EU risk assessment noted that the evidence for carcinogenicity of decaBDEwas considered to be equivocal. In a 103-week feeding study in mice therewas an increase in hepatocellular adenomas or carcinomas at the lowestdose (3200 mg/kg bw/day), at higher dose (6650 mg/kgbw/day). Thyroid gland follicular cell adenomas were reported in malemice at both doses. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity in femalemice. In a 103-week feeding study in rats there was a dose dependantincrease in neoplastic liver nodules, which was significantly greater thanAdvice on fish consumption 149control in low dose males (1120 mg/kg bw/day) and in both sexes at the high dose (2240 mg/kg bw/day)3. 7.20 In a developmental study in rats, oral administration of commercial pentaBDE on days 6-15 of gestation resulted in no adverse fetal effects atthe doses up to 200 mg/kg bw/day 1. Commercial preparations of octaBDE have been shown to cause fetal toxicity and malformations at doses belowthose causing maternal toxicity in rats and rabbits. The EU risk assessmentidentified 2 mg/kg bw/day as the lowest NOAEL for octaBDE, from astudy in rabbits in which slight fetotoxicity was observed at 5 mg/kgbw/day 2. A commercial preparation of decaBDE did not show developmental effects following dietary administration in the diet to rats atdoses up to 100 mg/kg bw/day for 60 days prior to mating until The PBDE congeners PBDE-47 reported to cause neurobehaviouralchanges in NMRI mice following a single oral dose administered on postnatal day (PND) 3, 10 or 19. Neurobehavioural effects were detected at 60and 120 days of age 14,15,16. In addition, perinatal exposure of CD1 mice to PBDE-99 resulted in neurobehavioural effects detected at 60 days17. The main neurobehavioural effect of PBDE-99 was delayed habituationbehaviour, which was found to occur at the lowest doses tested (0.6mg/kg 17; and 0.8 mg/kg15,16). 7.22 Limited data on the interaction of a range of PBDE congeners with the arylhydrocarbon (Ah) receptor suggest that those measured have muchlower potency than the dioxins and co-planar PCBs 18,19. In vitro studies have suggested that a range of PBDEs have endocrine disrupting activitymediated via the 7.23 All toxicological studies with HBCD were conducted using the commercial mixture. Studies in laboratory animals have shown that,following oral administration, HBCD can be detected in the adipose tissue,liver and muscle. Longer-term exposure shows HBCD has the potential tobioaccumulate. The -isomer has been found to accumulate more than the - and -isomers. The extent of metabolism of the commercial HBCD isAdvice on fish consumption 150unknown. Following oral administration, the majority of HBCD was detected unchanged in the faeces, although it is unclear how much of thiswas unabsorbed material. There is no information on the toxicokinetics ofHBCD in humans 4. 7.24 Repeat dose studies of HBCD have identified the liver as a key target organ. Increased liver weights and disturbances in thyroid hormones wereobserved at 100 mg/kg bw/day which was the lowest dose tested 4. 7.25 HBCD was not mutagenic in one study using S. typhimurium and did not induce chromosomal aberrations in human peripheral blood lymphocytesin the presence and absence of metabolic activation. HBCD caused a slightbut significant increase in somatic recombinations in a non-standard assayusing two Chinese hamster cell lines containing duplication mutations inthe hprt gene. The relevance of this is unclear. In vivo , there were no significant increases in the frequency of micronuclei in mouse bonemarrow cells. In an 18-month lifetime study of dietary administration tomice (available to the EU rapporteur in summary form only) there were notreatment related increases in tumour incidence at HBCD doses of 13-1300mg/kg bw/day) 4. 7.26 Administration of HBCD to pregnant rats at dietary doses up to 750 mg/kg bw/day, or gavage doses up to 1000 mg/kg bw/day did not result in fetaltoxicity or teratogenicity 4. HBCD has also been investigated for neurodevelopmental effects21. A single dose of HBCD resulted in changes in spontaneous behaviour. However, this information was only availableas an abstract, the doses resulting in these effects were unclear andtherefore the data could not be used in the risk assessment. COT evaluation of the toxicological properties of PBDEs and HBCDs 7.27 There are deficiencies in the toxicological database of the PBDEs and HBCD and these uncertainties need to be reflected in the evaluation. Themajority of studies reviewed were relatively old and, although conductedto the standards of the time would not meet current requirements for studydesign and reporting. In addition, the duration of the longest studiesAdvice on fish consumption 151undertaken with pentaBDE were similar to the reported half-life and the resulting tissue concentrations would only reach half of their maximalvalue by the end of the study. 7.28 The limited data on the toxicokinetics of the PBDEs suggest differences in absorption and excretion of individual compounds. Data on thegenotoxicity, carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity of PBDEs andHBCD are also limited. As the EU is introducing prohibitions on the useof some PBDEs, it is unlikely that new studies will be undertaken toaddress the deficiencies in the toxicological databases. 7.29 The toxicity studies have generally been conducted using commercial mixtures of PBDEs and HBCD. The composition of the material used inmany of the studies was unclear and likely to differ from the mixture ofcongeners measured in food and the environment. Although a similarpattern of biological effects was reported for different mixtures,extrapolation of findings between mixtures should be treated with caution. 7.30 Whilst some Ah receptor mediated activity could be measured with PBDEs, the potency was low and the most sensitive end-points of toxicitywere unlikely to be mediated by this mechanism. It has also beensuggested that PBDEs have endocrine disrupting activity mediated via theoestrogen receptor, although the current data are limited. 7.31 The liver is a target organ for the PBDEs, with pentaBDE being the most toxic, and decaBDE the least. OctaBDE has been found to exhibitreproductive toxicity, whereas pentaBDE and decaBDE did not produceadverse effects in routine developmental studies. 7.32 Non-routine studies suggest that the most sensitive endpoints are neurodevelopmental. Two of the congeners that are present in commercialpentaBDE, have been shown to cause neurobehavioural effects in adultmice following administration of a single postnatal oral dose. Octa- anddecaBDE, and the congeners commonly found in them, have not beeninvestigated using this protocol. Advice on fish consumption 1527.33 HBCD is also hepatotoxic. It has not shown evidence of developmental toxicity in routine studies. One study, available in abstract form only,indicates that it might produce neurodevelopmental effects but there isinsufficient detail to use the data in risk assessment. 7.34 Table 7.2 shows the NOAELs and LOAELs for the key effects of the PBDEs and HBCD. Based on the available data, pentaBDE appears to bethe most toxic of the PBDEs, with a NOAEL of 0.45 mg/kg bw/day forliver effects a LOAEL 0.6 mg/kg bw/dayfor neurodevelopmental effects following a dose. ForHBCD, are 100 mg/kg for neurodevelopmental effectsfollowing a single post-natal dose. 7.35 It is anticipated that the human perinatal blood-brain barrier would be as permeable to PBDE as that of the mouse neonatal blood-brain barrier.There is no single neurodevelopmental stage of the human brain that isdirectly comparable with the mouse, as different brain parts develop atdifferent rates in the two species. These studies involved administration atpostnatal days 3 and 10, at which age the mouse brain probably models thehuman brain from 1 month pre-natal to 1 month post-natal. There is a lackof data on levels in breast milk, which might be a major source at thecritical time for neurodevelopmental toxicity.Advice on fish and LOAELs for PBDEs or HBCD 7.36 In view of the inadequacies in the toxicological database and the absence of identifiable no-effect levels, it was not possible to determine a tolerabledaily intake (TDI). The Committee therefore decided to take a Margin ofExposure (MoE) approach in which the estimated human exposures arecompared with the relevant NOAEL or LOAEL identified from the animalstudies. Had it been possible to establish a TDI from a NOAEL,uncertainty factors (UFs) would be required to allow for inter-andintraspecies differences in toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics (100) andlimitations in the database such as study duration and gaps in the data (upto 10). Combining these uncertainty factors suggests a target MoE of 1000for liver toxicity of penta-BDE, above which risks to health would not beexpected. A NOAEL has not been identified for the neurodevelopmentaleffects of penta-BDE and therefore an additional UF of 3-10 would berequired for extrapolation from a LOAEL to a NOAEL. This suggests atarget MoE of 3,000-10,000. Similarly, a NOAEL has not been identifiedfor the hepatic effects of HBCD, indicating a target MoE of 3,000-10,000.The exposure is not expected to represent a risk to health if the calculatedMoE exceeds the target MoE.BFR NOAEL LOAEL Target Comments (mg/kg (mg/kg bw/day) pentaBDE1available PBDE-99 ND 0.6 Neurodevelopment (2,2',4,4',5-pentaBDE) 15 Commercial 2 5 Reproduction No neurodevelopmental octaBDE 2ND 7.2 Liver data Commercial ND 1,120 Liver No neurodevelopmental decaBDE3data Commercial ND 100 Liver Chronic data seen in HBCD4summary form only ND: NOAEL was not determined in the study identifying the LOAELAdvice on fish consumption 154PBDEs and HBCDs in fish from the Skerne Tees survey and in the 2001 Total Diet Study (TDS) 7.37 In 1999, a study sponsored by the Department of the Environment, Transport and Regions measured the concentration of PBDEs in rivers andestuaries downsteam of potential sources. The maximum concentrationsof PBDEs were detected in the livers of fish (1294 \u00b5g/kg wet wt) and sediment (239 \u00b5g/kg dry wt) from the Skerne-Tees river system and the Tees estuary at Newton Aycliffe, which is downstream from the GreatLakes Chemical Company 22. The Great Lakes Chemical Company is known to have manufactured both penta- and octaBDE at this site until thelate 1990's, and still produces HBCD. DecaBDE was never manufacturedat the site but may have been distributed via this site. The concentrationsdetected in the fish livers and sediment were only measured at one time-point and it is important to note that the trout in this river are restockedannually indicating these figures may not accurately represent the actuallevels of contamination in the river. 7.38 Following these reports, the Food Standards Agency conducted a survey to determine the concentrations of congeners known to be components ofcommercial penta- and octaBDE in brown trout and eels from the Skerne-Tees river system. The Great Lakes Chemical Company is also known tohave manufactured HBCD and thus, it was included in the survey. Thechemical formula of the each congener and the BFR to which eachcongener corresponds is given in Table 7.3. A preliminary assessment ofdietary exposure based on analysis of food samples from the 2001 TotalDiet Study (TDS) was also conducted. Advice on fish consumption 155Table 7.3: PBDE and HBCD congeners measured in the FSA survey 7.39 A survey was commenced in late 2001 to determine the concentrations of PBDE and HBCD in brown trout and eels from the Skerne-Tees riversystem. The samples examined included control samples of trout and eelsfrom the Skerne and eels from the Tees. Samples were obtained from theriver Skerne and river Tees at eight easily accessible locations that wereupstream and downstream of the Great Lakes Chemical Company and atthe confluence of the two rivers (see Figure 7.3). The PBDE congenersanalysed in the survey were selected as a representative sample of thoseproduced and used in the Skerne-Tees area. The chemical formula of eachcongener and the commercial PBDE to which each congener correspondsis given in Table 7.3. 7.40 At the time of this survey no data were available on other sources of dietary exposure to PBDEs and HBCDs in the UK. Therefore, a survey ofthe concentrations of PBDE congeners in food samples from the 2001Total Diet Study (TDS) was commissioned in 2002. Single compositefood group samples were formed by homogenising individual foodsgroups (excluding beverages) from 24 locations. These composite samplesCongener Chemical formula Component PBDE 28 2, 4, 4'-TriBDE Possible component of commercial pentaBDE PBDE 47 2, 2', 4, 4'-TetraBDE Known substantial component commercial pentaBDE PBDE 99 2, 2', 4, 4', 5-PentaBDE Known substantial commercial pentaBDE PBDE 100 2, 2', 4, 4', 6-PentaBDE Known substantial of commercial pentaBDE PBDE 153 2, 2', 4, 4', 5, 5'-HexaBDE Possible of commercial pentaBDE and known component ofcommercial octaBDE PBDE 154 2, 2', 4, 4', 5, 6S, 9S, 10S-HBCD Known component of commercial HBCD R & S indicate the stereo position of the bromine on the HBCD moleculeAdvice on fish consumption 156were analysed for the same range of PBDE congeners as the fish survey. It had been planned to additionally analyse these samples for decaBDE,however since none of the congeners measured were detectable thisanalysis was not undertaken. Analytical methodology 7.41 The analytical method involved solvent extraction of the fat component of composite samples from the TDS or a portion of flesh removed from fishor eels. The extracts contained BFRs and other compounds that wereseparated from the dissolved fat component by adsorptionchromatography. The PBDEs were measured using gas chromatographycoupled to a mass spectrometric detector (GC-MS). 7.42 For HBCD, a simplified clean-up stage was performed which consisted of shaking another aliquot of the crude extract with concentrated sulphuricacid. The acid destroys the fats but leaves HBCD compounds intact. Thetemperatures used to separate PBDEs during GC analysis can affect thestructures of the isomers and result in conversion between the three HBCDisomers. Therefore HBCD was determined using a liquid chromatographymass spectrometry (LC-MS) method. 7.43 Due to their lipophilicity BFRs are most likely to be detected in fatty foods. The production of composite samples from the individual foodsthat comprise a particular food group in the TDS may result in dilution ofthe overall fat content and thus may reduce the ability to detect thesesubstances. Dietary exposure to PBDEs and HBCD from Skerne Tees trout and eels 7.44 Table 7.4 shows the concentration ranges of total PBDEs and HBCD in trout and eels taken from those test sites where the highest concentrationswere found and from the control sites. The most contaminated trout werecaught at the Haughton Road site, which was the closest river Skernelocation downstream of the Great Lakes Chemical Company. No eels arecaught at this site, and the most contaminated eels were caught from thenext river Skerne downstream location at Oxenfield Bridge.The sum of theAdvice on fish consumption 157concentrations of individual PBDE congeners detected in the edible portion varied from 12 to 14 \u00b5g/kg freshweight in trout and was 53 \u00b5g/kg freshweight in the eel at control sites. At test sites, the sum of theconcentrations varied from 59 to 197 \u00b5g/kg freshweight in trout and 164 to 288 \u00b5g/kg freshweight in eels. 7.45 For HBCD the concentration in the edible portion of trout varied from 21- 119\u00b5g/kg freshweight and was 159 \u00b5g/kg freshweight in the eel at control sites. At test sites, the sum of the concentrations was 159 to 6758 \u00b5g/kg freshweight in trout and 570 to 9432 \u00b5g/kg in eels. The trout population of the Skerne Tees River system is restocked annually and noinformation was available to ascertain the ages of the fish sampled andwhether concentrations increased in older fish. Detailed results will bepublished in a Food Surveillance Information Sheet. 7.46 The estimated average intake from consumption of one weekly portion (120g) of trout at the maximum levels detected were 0.056 \u00b5g/kg bw/day of PBDEs and 1.9 \u00b5g/kg bw/day of HBCD. The estimated average intake from consumption of one weekly portion (20g) of eels, and 0.014 of HBCD for eels. 7.47 There are no commercial fisheries in the river and consumption would be limited to fish caught by anglers. Total dietary exposure to PBDEs and HBCD 7.48 None of the congeners measured was present at concentrations exceeding the limit of detection (LOD) in any of the composite TDS samplesanalysed. Estimated intakes were therefore calculated from the upperbound concentrations (assuming that PBDE and HBCD were present at theLOD in all foods) together with consumption data from the 2000 NationalDiet and Nutrition Survey 24. Dietary exposure for mean adult consumers was estimated to be 0.047 \u00b5g/kg bw/day for the sum of the PBDE congeners 0.010 \u00b5g/kg bw/day for the sum of HBCD isomers. The actual intakes might be very much lower.Advice on fish consumption 158Table 7.4: Estimated average dietary intake of PBDE and HBCD following consumption of trout or eels from the Skerne-Tees river system COT evaluation of dietary exposure to PBDEs and HBCD 7.49 The concentrations of PBDEs and HBCD detected varied widely in the fish sampled from the test sites and also from those sites considered to becontrol sites. In the absence of information to the contrary, it is assumedthat the fish will move freely around the Skerne-Tees river system andtherefore concentrations in the fish taken from one site are notrepresentative. It is therefore not possible to identify an averageconcentration of PBDEs or HBCD which could be used to estimate intakefor an individual regularly consuming fish caught from an individual site.Therefore worst-case intake estimations have been calculated from theBFR and Species No of Concentration Maximum Maximumsampling samples range (Oxenfield Bridge) 570-9432 190 0.45 a Control site for Skerne Riverb Test site showing the highest concentration of PBDEs or HCBD in trout or eelsc Portion sizes were assumed to be 120g trout or 20g eels, as cited in MAFF Food Portion Sizes 23 d Average daily intake was calculated assuming consumption of one portion of trout or eels per week and an adult bodyweight of 60kgAdvice on fish consumption 159highest measured concentration at any site. It is unlikely that this worst case intake would be achieved on a regular basis. 7.50 The PBDE congeners measured in the survey were selected as major representative components of penta- and octaBDE. Toxicity data are notavailable for the individual congeners. Concentrations of the individualcongeners have therefore been summed for comparison with the toxicitydata on the commercial PBDE mixtures. Studies on the commercialPBDEs indicate that pentaBDE is the most toxic. Comparison of theestimated intakes of the sum of the measured PBDE congeners with thereported effect levels for pentaBDE provides a precautionary approachbecause some of the congeners are expected to be less toxic. 7.51 The most sensitive effect of pentaBDE and HBCD was considered to be neurodevelopmental. The LOAEL for pentaBDE (600 \u00b5g/kg bw/day) for this effect was obtained from studies in which the test material wasadministered by a single oral dose to mice on postnatal days 3 or 10.Limited evidence suggests that HBCD also has this effect. Human infantsof comparable developmental stage (up to 1 month) would not eat fish andso would not be directly exposed to PBDE or HBCD from fish. AlthoughpentaBDE is known to pass into breast-milk, the available data are notsufficient to estimate the potential exposure to the breast-fed infantresulting from consumption of contaminated fish by the mother. There is aneed for data on levels of PBDEs and HBCD in breast-milk in the UK, inorder to determine whether the breast-fed infant is at risk ofneurodevelopmental effects arising from consumption of contaminatedfish. The available studies on reproductive toxicity have not includedinvestigation of neurobehavioural effects, and therefore there are no dataof relevance to exposure by pregnant women. Overall, it was considerednot possible to calculate a relevant MoE with respect toneurodevelopmental effects. 7.52 For older children and adults eating trout or eels contaminated with PBDEs and HBCD, the liver toxicity is the most relevant and sensitive effect onwhich to base a risk assessment. Advice on fish consumption 1607.53 The worst-case estimated intake of total PBDEs from consuming one portion of trout per week from the Skerne-Tees river system was 0.056\u00b5g/kg bw/day indicating a MoE of approximately 10,000 compared with the NOAEL of 450 \u00b5g/kg bw/day for liver effects of pentaBDE in rats. The MoE for intake of PBDEs from consuming one portion of eels per weekwould be 40,000. Since these MoEs are larger than the target MoE of 1000for pentaBDE, these intakes are unlikely to pose a health risk. 7.54 The worst case estimated intake of total HBCD from consuming one portion of trout per week was 1.9 \u00b5g/kg bw/day indicating a MoE of approximately 50,000 compared with the LOAEL of 100,000 \u00b5g/kg bw/day for liver effects of HBCD in rats. The MoE for intake of HBCDfrom consuming one portion of eels per week would be 200,000. Sincethese MoEs are larger than the target MoE of 3,000-10,000 for HBCD,these intakes are unlikely to pose a health risk. Conclusions 7.55 We conclude that the uncertainties and deficiencies in the toxicological databases for PBDEs and HBCD prevent establishment of tolerable dailyintakes. A Margin of Exposure (MoE) approach has therefore been used inthis risk assessment. 7.56 We consider that the most sensitive endpoint for the PBDEs appears to be neurodevelopmental effects resulting from a single oral administration toneonatal mice at a developmental stage comparable to infants up to onemonth of age, and limited data indicate that HBCD could also have thiseffect. It is reassuring that infants of this age do not eat fish and thereforeare not directly exposed to PBDEs from this source. 7.57 We note the uncertainty in the relevance of the neurodevelopmental effects for exposure to the fetus or breast-fed infant following maternalconsumption of fish containing high levels of PBDEs or HBCD. Thisresults from the lack of neurodevelopmental studies with exposure duringpregnancy and the lack of information on concentrations in breast milk thatcould result from consumption of fish by the mother.Advice on fish consumption 1617.58 We note that consumption of fish from the Skerne Tees is unlikely to be widespread since there are no commercial fisheries in the area. Howevergiven the variability in BFR levels observed in this limited survey, it is notpossible to exclude higher intakes in a small number of anglers or otherseating their fish. 7.59 We consider that comparison of the worst case estimated intakes from consumption of a single portion of eels or trout per week from the SkerneTees with the available toxicological data indicates that these intakes areunlikely to represent a risk to health. However, in view of the uncertaintiessurrounding the toxicological database and exposure assessments, thisconclusion should be considered tentative. 7.60 PentaBDE and octaBDE are being phased out in 2004, which offers some reassurance that exposure to these compounds is unlikely to increasesignificantly. Concentrations of deca-BDE and HBCD should continue tobe monitored, particularly in fatty foods. COT statement 2003/04 October 2003 References 1. Pentabromodiphenyl ether.
