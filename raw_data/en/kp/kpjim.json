To learn more about the pineal gland, see: [What is the Pineal Gland?](http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/01/22/what-is-the-pineal-gland/) For the people that seek to fully activate their spiritual potential and tap into the power of the pineal gland, one must begin by strengthening its function though detoxification and proper nutrition.

These form calcium shells around themselves for protection from our immune systems which has resulted in [calcification of the pineal gland](http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/05/16/the-spiritual-eye-how-to-decalcify-awaken-your-pineal-gland/), a build-up of calcium phosphate crystals in various parts of the human body. Many of us have a pineal gland that is already completely calcified. This does not fare well when we try to tap into the esoteric capabilities of this gland through yoga practice, meditation, using plant medicines such as [ayahuasca](http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/07/15/ayahuasca-an-amazonian-healing-plant/), and so forth.

When purchasing melatonin supplements, make sure the products are plant-based and not animal tested. It is suggested that you always start with the smallest dosage possible and do not use any melatonin supplement for longer than three months. Recommended products: 2.

Iodine Many of us have been exposed to sodium fluoride due to fluoridation of our water systems, and this has also resulted in the calcification of the pineal gland.

To avoid calcium deficiency when taking iodine supplements, a diet incorporating many organic foods such as kale, broccoli, almonds, oranges, flax seed, sesame seeds, dill, thyme and other dried herbs is recommended. It is suggested that a non-GMO lecithin supplement is also taken to compliment iodine intake.
