Acupuncture and Detox - Toxins In, Toxins Out ~ Whenever people are considering a cleanse, or even a major diet or lifestyle change, acupuncture is recommended. It is more challenging for body to adapt to large changes, and acupuncture acts as a guiding light for system as it balances out. Of course changes can be made without acupuncture, but treatments makes the experience much easier, and tend to improve health overall. Acupuncture has a natural detoxification effect. Grouped with carefully selected meridian points, acupuncture increases excretion of body toxins, clears up the metabolites lodged in particular organs, boosts up brain function, benefiting patients both physically and mentally. In other words, acupuncture gives the body the necessary tools it needs to restore health. \"Opening the Outlets\" Acupuncture discovers the exact areas of blockage in the body, and opens the \"outlets\" by freeing the vital energy and blood, so proper detox can occur. An [acupuncture](http://www.selfgrowth.com/acupuncture.html) treatment can help you to reduce appetite or cravings, even as it eliminates blockage of the Qi. Foods that are usually connected with the foundation of toxins will not regain your appetite or desire for foods. Eating them will only create feelings of heaviness because the flow of energy is hindered in the body. When proper food is consumed, energy is recharged in your body. Because the body can learn which foods are proper, acupuncture makes it so effective. Adjustment and Detox ~ Do you Know? The spine houses thirty-one different sections of nerves that are responsible for pretty much everything that goes on in your body. Proper spine alignment is essential for healthy and accurate nerve communication, which can affect everything from your digestion to cognitive function. Now you may be thinking \"Could a Chiropractor Help You Detox Your Body?\" Studies show that regular chiropractic adjustments help the movement of Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) and blood circulation to the brain. Both blood and CSF are crucial for nourishing the brain and essential in detoxification the brain and nervous system. Not wonder so many people notice better memory, less headaches and overall increased sense of brain body connection after their regular chiropractic adjustment. Chiropractic adjustments actually release toxins that have built up in the body over time. The chiropractor does this by manipulating your joints and spine in order to achieve proper alignment. When this happens, the spine and joints can release toxins that have accumulated in there as a result of the body's wear on this improper alignment. Releasing toxins not only encourages healthy bodies, but it also helps us to cultivate positive energy. When so many toxins have built up over time, this can create an environment where it's easy for our bodies to harbor negativity. We can cultivate positive energy through chiropractic adjustments by getting those toxins out of there and having a healthier, happier body as a result. Chiropractic adjustments balance and calm the nervous system while a detox program purifies the body's metabolic systems. A thorough cleanse can help purify your system and get you balanced again, but it is only partially effective if chiropractic care isn't included. It is important to include chiropractic while cleansing, as adjustments help regulate the digestive system and keep things moving smoothly. HBOT and Detox ~ Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) is a natural therapy in which a person is exposed to increased atmospheric pressure inside an inflatable chamber. This is an extremely effective treatment that dramatically improves oxygen delivery to tissues throughout the body, increases levels of rejuvenating stem cells, wakes up damaged brain cells and stimulates production of new blood vessels.
