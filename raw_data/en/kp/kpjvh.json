Kamalaya is a luxurious wellness and holistic spa retreat situated in a lush valley on the southern coast of Koh Samui, an island that is known for its sandy beaches, coral reefs and coconut trees. The spiritual energy is so pure and intense at Kamalaya that it is no wonder that Buddhist monks came to this area to contemplate, and it is around their cave of worship that the resort was built. Kamalaya is staffed by some of Asia's best healers, including owner Karina Stewart, a master of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The treatments are authentic and deep, and are offered by caring and loving therapists. Many of the counsellors at Kamalaya are former monks and the resort also invites visiting experts from overseas. Guests are treated to delectable, near-vegan food that zings with the flavours of Asian fusion. Calorie counting is not the Kamalaya way, so guests can indulge in their favorite foods and even enjoy a glass of organic wine for dinner in the evening.
