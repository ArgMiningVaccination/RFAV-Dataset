Regardless, probably the last thing on our minds is health. From a Western perspective, religion and medicine are like oil and water: no matter which way you look at it, they don't mix. In fact, on several different issues, many Christian orders are at odds with public health measures. Travel 9,000 miles across the globe to Sri Lanka, however, and you'll find a very different perception. Over 80% of Sri Lankans are Buddhist, and for them, religion is deeply integrated health. No longer are the two sectors oil and water, but more like......Nutella and bananas. They complement each other perfectly. Growing up traveling back and forth to Sri Lanka every year, I used to hear stories of people seeking religious healers for ailments or curses placed on them by neighbors. My mind would jump to voodoo, superstition, magic, and this clip of possibly the world's most famous shaman: I refused to acknowledge these practices because I didn't understand them. There had to be some other reason, some other explanation. After spending this past summer in Sri Lanka, can I say I fully understand the inner workings of religious healing? Unfortunately, no. But I can say that I appreciate it and recognize Buddhist rituals and healing as one of the integral \"layers\" of the Sri Lankan health care system. Just as with other medical traditions, many Sri Lankans look to Buddhist healing when they feel it is appropriate, and use it parallel to allopathic or ayurvedic medicine. It had just been one of those days at the hospital. It was a few weeks into my research, and while I had a few patient interviews that day, it seemed like no one really wanted to do much talking (read: I got A LOT of [Sri Lankan Head Waggle](https://whereeastfindswest.wordpress.com/2014/04/19/layers-as-told-by-shrek-the-ogre/) for answers). Just as I was about to call it a day and head home, I saw some of the nurses outfitting a bed. Gleaming white satin sheets, five plush pillows, and a white bath mat were replacing the typical tattered bedding that adorned all the other hospital bunks. Was the president of Sri Lanka coming to Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital? I sat on a bench and waited for this much-anticipated guest until I finally saw him: an elderly Buddhist priest, surrounded by a gaggle of adorning followers. My excitement rose as I mulled over how I was going to get an audience with him. Not only was this a great photo opportunity (only partially kidding, check out the [bottom of this page](http://kellogg.nd.edu/students/grants/index.shtml)), but I hoped he would have an insightful perspective on Buddhism, ayurveda, and healing. It turns out, he did. After finally getting to sit down and talk to him, the priest explained to me the historical relationship between Buddhism and ayurveda, and how for the majority of his life he only used ayurvedic medicine. When I questioned him about other types of Buddhist healing, he explained the concept of pirith, which are distinct chants in Buddhism used for a variety of reasons: to bring good health, to ward of evil and danger, to protect from evil spirits, to shield people from the inauspicious alignment of the planets, to bring success.....the list goes on. He showed me his noul, which were bracelets of white thread wrapped around his wrist. Pirith is prayed over these threads, and wearing the blessed noul is what brings about the desired effect. Amulets, or suras, can also be blessed with pirith chants, and can also bring about protection and health. He expertly explained the interconnectedness of health and Buddhist tradition, and began to open my eyes to Buddhism as an important healing modality in Sri Lanka. Throughout my research, the patients I interviewed only confirmed the importance of religious healing within the Sri Lankan medical system. From all sides, example after example of a time they sought Buddhist healing poured out. I learned how pirith can be chanted over water that will be used to remove a curse from a home. One woman explained that she seeks her fortune from a deva, a human who is seen as superior and is treated as god-like. Devas live in buildings known as devalayas, and they are often sought after to help with various issues in one's life. In fact, it was the deva who told the patient she had upahla (or bad omens) and suggested she come to the hospital. Still other examples kept coming. If someone is thought to be possessed by a devil, cutting lemons is a simple way to attempt to remove the spirit. If this does not work, spiritual exorcism ceremonies (called tovils) are held publicly for the affected person. Although I did not get the chance to attend a tovil, here is a short video of one that explains the different steps involved: Although I did not realize it till this summer, these beliefs completely permeate Sri Lankan society, regardless of social class. One woman I worked with told me her nephew had been affected by aswaha, best described as harm inflicted out of jealousy of another person. \"He was an adorable baby, but every time we took him outside he would get blemishes all over his body. A religious man told us it might be due to aswaha, and so we tried the treatment: soak a small piece of cloth in ghee (butter), stuff it into a block of keribhat (milk rice), and feed it to crows and dogs only on Wednesdays and Sundays, which are regarded as auspicious days. Quickly after we started this, the rashes stopped.\" I found all of these stories fascinating and wanted to experience some form of it for myself. Sure enough, one of the ayurvedic practitioners I worked with knew a religious man who made suras (the amulets blessed with pirith) and asked if I wanted to have one made. The very next day I was given a shopping list of all the items needed to perform the ceremony. Flowers, banana leaves, incense, and a variety of herbs were just a few items on the list. That night, Sumudu and I rode out to the outskirts of the city to visit the man in his home and watch him prepare the suras. As he prepared the station, he explained the different piriths that would be chanted and showed me the metal design that would go inside the amulet. On the left is the sun, and on the right the moon, to represent the protection you will receive both day and night. The ceremony took several hours and went late into the night, but it was so worth it. Thinking back, I can still smell the overwhelmingly thick incense and hear the constant, monotone chanting as the man prayed over the station. It was an experience that I still find hard to describe, but for me, at least, it was a time of surreal peace. As you can see, religious healing plays a tremendous role in the lives of many Sri Lankans and the way they view health. While I have only focused on Buddhism here (as that is the predominant religion in Anuradhapura), I am sure other religious groups also have their own beliefs and traditions that complement other health practices. Although I don't completely understand how it works or why it works, if I learned anything this summer, it's that maybe that's okay. Western logic is limited, and is not able to explain all phenomena in our world. What is important to understand, though, is the role religion plays in shaping many Sri Lankans' perspective on health and healing. To many, religious healing is yet another health care option to be used under the right circumstances. The emphasis I saw on religious healing practices this summer confirmed the holistic view that Sri Lankans take to health. They do not objectify their body and focus solely on biochemical processes, but rather see their being and their body as one unit. Through religious healing as well as other medical traditions, many Sri Lankans cater to all aspects of their health in a comprehensive manner. While I am not suggesting that the United States adopts Buddhism as their national religion, I do think we could learn to look at our health from a more holistic perspective, rather than just as symptoms or illness. Health is something that is influenced by, and influences, all aspects of our life, and we should regard it as an integral part of our being. "}
