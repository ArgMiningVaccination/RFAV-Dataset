Address for correspondence: Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiy211/4969761 by guest on April , the causative agent of toxoplasmosis, a prevalent disease that can affect all warm -blooded animals and humans [1-3]. Infections in immunocompromised individuals, such as organ transplant patients and AIDS patients, can cause severe or even a fatal outcome [1-3]. Primary infection during pregnancy can cause neonatal malformations, miscarriage, chorioretinitis, blindness, mental retardation and hydrocephalus in the infected fetus [3-6]. Current treatment s of toxoplasmosis are challenged by side effects of current medications [7] and the occurrence of drug -resistant strains [8]. New approaches are therefore needed to develop more effective interventions for better prevention and control of toxoplasmosis . Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiy211/4969761 by guest on 17 April 2018Accepted Manuscript Vaccination using live-attenuated strain s is promising because it can trigger a protective humoral and cellular immunity through simulating natural infection without leading to the disease [9,10 ]. A commercially available vaccine, Toxovax\u00ae, developed from T. gondii S48 strain, is licensed for use in sheep and goats to prevent abortion in the UK, New Zealand, France, and Ireland [11]. Attenuation of the virulence of T. gondii through deletion of certain genes has been achieved in several studies [12-18]. The Mic1 -3KO RH strain , lacking mic1 mice against and congenital toxoplasmosis [12] and reduced T. gondii -induced abortion and tissue cyst burden in lambs born to vaccinated ewes [13]. Recently, we have shown that immunization of Kunming mice with RH:GRA17 conferred significant protecti on against acute , chronic and congenital T. gondii infection [14]. Other groups have shown that uracil auxotrophic mutant s elicited a protective immunity against acute and chron ic T. gondii infection in mice 14 Ca2+-dependent protein kinases ( which play important roles in the parasite's motility, colonization, replication and egress [19-23]. Recently, cdpk2 has been shown to play a role in the regulation of parasite amylopectin synthesis and degradation [23]. Disruption of cdpk2 induce d abnormal accumulation of massive amylopectin granules in T. gondii tachyzoites and in the vacuolar space of the residual bodies , together with complete ablation of cyst formation [23]. Because of its inability to establish chronic infection in mice [23], Pru: cdpk2 mutant has emerged as an attractive candidate to produce a safe and efficacious vaccine [24]. Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiy211/4969761 by guest on 17 April 2018Accepted Manuscript In this study, we determined the protective efficacy o f a live attenuated T. gondii Pru mutant with a target deletion of cdpk2 (designated Pru: cdpk2 ), delivered with 500 Pru: cdpk2 tachyzoites develop ed a protective immune response against acute, chronic and congenital toxoplasmosis . We also explore d the possibility that if disruption of cdpk2 in RH strain impairs its virulence in mice, then a RH: cdpk2 mutant might be a potential vaccine candidate. MATERIALS AND METHODS Mice Eight -week -old Kunming mice were obtained from Laboratory Animal Center of Lanzhou University. All procedures were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Kunming mice were used in this study because of their susceptibility to acute and chronic T. gondii infection [14, 25-27] and because of their ability to produce more pups per litter , to better assess protection against congenital infection , compared with BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice [28]. PYS and strains RH: and Pru: cdpk2 were maintained in human foreskin fibroblast culture s, as previously described Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiy211/4969761 by guest on 17 April 2018Accepted Manuscript [22, 29]. Cysts of T. gondii Pru strain were isolated from brain homogenates of Kunming mice as previously described [25-27]. Disruption of CDPK2 by CRISPR -Cas9 system CRISPR -Cas9 system was used to knockout cdpk2 gene as previously described [30]. Guide RNA and primers used in the study to generate mutant cdpk2 strains are listed in Supplementary Table S1. The pattern of in vitro growth of tachyzoites of T. gondii cdpk2 deletion mutant was compared to wild type ( WT) strain as previous ly described [14]. Virulence of Mutants Versus Wild -type Strains in Mice Freshly harvested 200 tachyzoites of RH strain or RH:cdpk2 mutant, or 1\u00d7105 tachyzoites of Pru strain or Pru: cdpk2 mutant were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) into mice (10 mice/ group/ parasite strain). The se mice were monitored daily for the development of clinical signs of acute illness and mortality was recorded until all mice died . Vaccination of Mice In these experiments, the efficacy of Pru: cdpk2 mutant strain in conferring protective immunity was evaluated against acute, chronic , and congenital T. gondii infections ( Supplementary Figure Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiy211/4969761 by guest on 17 April 2018Accepted Manuscript S1).

Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiy211/4969761 by guest on 17 April 2018Accepted Manuscript Seventy dpv, both vaccinated and age -matched na\u00efve mice were challenged i.p. with 200 l PBS 1,000 tachyzoites of RH, ToxoDB#9 (PYS or TgC7 ) strain to test efficacy against acute infection ; or were inoculated orally with 20 Pru cysts to test efficacy ag ainst chronic infection . Strains of ToxoDB#9, the predominant genotype in China, ha ve a comparable virulence to type I RH strain [31, 32]. Thus , it was sensible to determine whether immune responses induce by the Pru: cdpk2 mutant strain protect s against infection with the local strains (TgC7 and PYS) of ToxoDB#9 genotype. It was also important to evaluate the ability of Pru: cdpk2 to confer protecti on against challenge with Pru strain , the predominant genotype during congenital infection in humans and sheep [33, 34]. The degree of illness and survival of all mice were observed daily for 35 days. Seven days post -infection (dpi), peritoneal fluid and serum samples collected from Pru: cdpk2 -vaccinated mice infected with RH, non -vaccinated + RH infected mice, and non-vaccinated + uninfected mice were tested for Th1 cytokines (IFN - and IL -12) during acute infection by ELISA. For chronic infection, mice were euthanized at 35 dpi , and their brains were removed and individually homogenized in 1 ml of PBS. Brain cyst 's burden was assessed by examining dilutions of DBL -stained brain homogenates 10\u00d7objective , as described [14]. Protection Against Congenital Transmission Female mice vaccinated with 500 Pru: cdpk2 tachyzoites were mated with male mice 70 dpv. Two female mice were housed in a cage with one male and every 12 h female mice were Protection against Acute and Chronic Infection Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiy211/4969761 by guest on 17 April 2018Accepted Manuscript inspected for the presence of vaginal p lugs. The day of presence of vaginal plug was designated day 1 of gestation. On day 12 of gestation, mice were infected orally with 10 T. gondii Pru cysts. Control mouse groups included: non -vaccinated uninfected mice (negative control), and non-vaccinated mice infected orally infected with 10 Pru cysts. The level of protection against congenital T. gondii infection was evaluated by analyzing litter size and survival rate of the naturally delivered pups at birth and 35 -day old. The body weight of pups at 35 -day old were also used to evaluate the protective efficacy. The level of maternal protection in Pru cysts -challenged dams and their pups was determined by quantifying the brain tissue cyst burden in surviving pups at 35 days of age, and in their dams at 30 days after delivery. Maternal splenocytes from pregnant mice challenged with 10 Pru cysts on day 12 of gestation were collected s ix days later . Splenocyte culture was stimulated with 10 \u00b5g/ml STAg and the level of Th1 ( IFN-, IL -2, IL -12), and Th2 ( IL-10) cytokines in vaccinated + infected mice, non -vaccinated + infected mice, and non -vaccinated + uninfected mice was evaluated using ELISA, as described above. Statistical Analysis The differences in the level of cytokines, anti -T. gondii antibodies and parasite cyst compared using two-tailed, unpaired Student's t -test (for comparing means between two groups) or one -way ANOVA analysis (for comparing means between three groups). The SD was derived from three independently performed experiments with three replicates per Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiy211/4969761 by guest on 17 April 2018Accepted Manuscript experiment for the in vitro assays. Values of P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Mortality was determined by plotting survival curves o f the different mouse groups stratified by T. gondii infection and vaccination status by Mantel -Cox log -rank test. RESULTS Deletion of cdpk2 gene in T. gondii RH and Pru Strains The cdpk2 gene was successfully knocked out in RH and Pru strains using CRISPR -Cas9 system. In both strains, t he DHFR* was inserted into the gRNA -targeted coding sequence region through nonhomologous end joining Supplementary Figure S2A ). Single, stable pyrimethamine -resistant clones were generated and verified by specific PCR method (Supplementary Figure S2B revealed abnormal morphology and excessive accumulation of granules at both the tachyzoites basal end and within the tachyzoites residual body, whereas tachyzoites of the WT RH and Pru strains appeared normal ( Supplementary Figure S3). These results demonstrate that cdpk2 gene was successfully knocked out in the mutant RH and Pru strains. Disrupt ion of cdpk2 does not affect virulence in mice Deletion of cdpk2 gene did not result in attenuation of the virulence of mutant RH or Pru strains, as indicate d by the comparable survival rates of mice infected with the parental WT or mutant Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiy211/4969761 by guest on 17 April 2018Accepted Manuscript strains (Supplem entary Figure S4 ). In an effort to achieve the required level of immunogenicity of the attenuated Pru: cdpk2 strain , without inducing an excessive immune response or death in the vaccinated mice, we reduced the number of type II Pru: cdpk2 tachyzoites used in the vaccination experiments from 105 to 500 tachyzoites. Mice challenged with 500 Pru :cdpk2 mutant tachyzoites survived and consistent with previous work [23], tissue cyst s were not detected in the brain of mice challenged with 500 Pru :cdpk2 tachyzoites , but brain tissue cyst s were detected in mice challenged with 500 WT Pru tachyzoites (data not shown) . Humoral immune responses induced by vaccination The immunogenicity of Pru:cdpk2 was assessed by determination of specific anti -T. gondii IgG antibody titers and IgG isotypes in the serum of vaccinated mice at 28 and 70 dpv by quantitative ELISA. At day 28 post -vaccination, all vaccinated mice had seroconverted with a higher level of anti -T. gondii IgG antibodies comp ared with non-vaccinated mice. This level of IgG titer remained high at 70 dpv (Figure 1). These results suggest that Pru: cdpk2 induced a strong humoral response. We then tested whether a Th1 and Th2 response was elicited in the vaccinated mice by evaluating the levels of STAg -specific IgG subclasses, IgG2a and IgG1 mice , the leve l of IgG2a was significantly higher in vaccinated mice at 28 and 70 dpv. The level of IgG1 was only increased in the vaccinated mice at 70 dpv, compared with non-vaccinated mice ( Figure 1). These results suggest Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiy211/4969761 by guest on 17 April 2018Accepted Manuscript that vaccination with Pru: cdpk2 in mice elicits a Th1 -type immune response at 28 dpv and a mixed Th1/Th2 immune response at 70 dpv. Cytokine production after vaccination Cytokine production in splenocyte culture supernatants stimulated with STAg was assessed by ELISA at 70 dpv. The levels of Th1 type cytokines (IFN -, IL -2 and IL -12) were significantly higher than those in non-vaccinated mice. Also , the level of Th2 type cytokine (IL-10) was significantly higher than that of mice ( Figure 2). Pru: cdpk2 immunogenicity and potency for protection against acute infection Kunming mice were vaccinated with 500 Pru: cdpk2 tachyzoites, and 70 days later, challenged with 1 ,000 tachyzoites of T. gondii type I RH strain, or ToxoDB#9 (PYS or TgC7 ) strain. As expected, all non-vaccinated mice infected with 1 ,000 RH strain or ToxoDB#9 (PYS or TgC7 ) strain s died within 10 days after infection, whereas all mice vaccinated survived regardless of the challenging strains ( Figure 3). We further analyzed Th 1 cytokines (IL -12 and IFN -) in the serum and peritoneal fluids at 7 days after infection. Significantly elevated levels of IL-12 and IFN- were found in the non -vaccinated + RH infected mice , while only modestly elevated levels of the same cytokines was observed in Pru: cdpk2 vaccinated + RH infected mice (Figure 4).

All Pru: cdpk2 -vaccinated mice survived infection with 20 T. gondii Pru parasite cysts, whereas only 40% of non -vaccinated infected mice survived (Figure 5A). At 35 days post -challenge, parasite cyst burden in the brain of survived Pru:cdpk2 -vaccinated compared with non-vaccinated mice was determined . Non -vaccinated mice challenged with 20 Pru cysts had \u00b1 687 cysts per brain, whereas Pru: cdpk2 -vaccinated mice challenged with the same number of Pru cysts had significantly fewer cysts per brain (78 \u00b1 48 cysts/brain) (P < 0.001; Figure 5B). Protection Against Congenital Toxoplasmosis Pregnant mice were orally challenged with 10 T. gondii Pru cysts on day 12 of gestation, the litter size and body weight of the neonates were determined . The cyst burden in the brain of neonates and dams was evaluated . The litter size and survival of pups of Pru: cdpk2 -vaccinated + Pru cysts infected dams , was similar to that of non-vaccinated uninfected mice (Figure 6A). Body weight of neonates born to Pru: cdpk2 -vaccinated + Pru cysts infected dams was similar to neonates born to non -vaccinated uninfected dams (Figure 6B).

Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiy211/4969761 by guest on 17 April 2018Accepted Manuscript A highly effective vaccine against toxoplas mosis is urgently required, with leading vaccination strateg ies eting both smission from preg nant dams to their offspring. Previous study has shown that cdpk2 is essential for the development of viable T. gondii tissue cysts, as cdpk2-deficient para site strains failed to form cysts in the brain of mice [23]. Based on this observation, we inferred that cdpk2-deficient T. gondii might be a promising live-atten uated vaccine to prev toxoplas mosis. In the pres ent study , cdpk2 was successfully disrupted in T. gondii RH and Pru strains using CRISPR-Cas9 method, and the mutant strains exhibited the anticipate d morphological abnorm alities, and no paras ite cyst was dete cted in the brain of mice challeng ed w ith Pru:cdpk2 tachyzo ites, which was consistent with prev ious study [23]. Our results showed that deleti on of cdpk2 gene did not result in the atten uation of the virule nce of RH or Pru strains, as indicated by the comparable survival rates of mice infected with the parent al WT (RH or Pru) or mutant (RH:cdpk2 or Pru:cdpk2) strains. A high dose (105) of Pru:cdpk2 tachyzoites caused mice deat h in 11 days, howev er all mice infected with the same strain, but with a smaller dose (500) survived and no parasite cyst was detected in their brain. Therefore, 500 Pru:cdpk2 tachyzoites were used in all subsequent experi ments as the vaccination dose because it exhibited the type of balance betwe en safety and high immunogenic ity that should be ex pected of a promising live-atten uated vaccine strain. Consistent with othe r attenuated T. gondii vaccines, vaccination with Pru:cdpk2 induced a high level of anti-T. gondii IgG antibodies in mice [12-18]. These specific IgG antibodies can neutrali ze the attachment of T. gondii and limit its abili ty to establish infection [35-38]. DISCUSSION Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiy211/4969761 by guest on 17 April 2018Accepted Manuscript Pru: cdpk2 -vaccinated mice also developed and mixed Th1/Th2 -type immune response , as indicated by the high level of Th1 immunity (IgG2a) at day 28 post -vaccination; and the elevation of Th2 protective (IgG1) level at day 70 dpv when compared to that in non-vaccinated mice . The high level of IgG2a and IgG1 in Pru: cdpk2 -vaccinated high levels of Th1 cytokines (IFN -, IL -2 and IL -12) and Th2 cytokines (IL -10) at 70 dpv. Indeed, these immune response induced by Pru: cdpk2 vaccination completely protected mice (i.e. 100% survival rate) -challenge with RH, TgC7 ) strain , whereas non-vaccinated mice died within 10 dpi. In addition, Pru:cdpk2 significantly reduced the development of chronic toxoplasmosis. The parasite cysts were significantly reduced in the brain of vaccinated mice after infection with 20 cysts of T. gondii Pru strain compared with non -vaccinated + Pru cysts infected mice . In our study, Th1 cytokin es from the non-vaccinated + RH -infected mice was significant higher than that from the Pru: cdpk2 vaccinated + RH -infected mice, indicating that vaccination with Pru: cdpk2 may have down -regulated Th1 response and reduced the severe inflammatory response that accompanies acute T. gondii infection [39-42]. Th1 -type cytokine response with high level of IFN -, IL -2 and IL -12, are needed to limit congenital transmission and to protect pregnant mice against T. gondii infection [43-46]. However, Th1 -type immune response can be detrimental to pregnancy and potentially deleterious for the conceptus [43, 44]. Thus, a balanced Th1/Th2 immune response detected at day 70 post -vaccination seems to contribute to the observed successful pregnancy outcomes; because unsuccessful pregnancies were observed at day 28 post -vaccination (data not shown) Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiy211/4969761 by guest on 17 April 2018Accepted Manuscript where Th1 response was dominating (Figure 1). Therefore, the high level of Th2 -related anti -inflammatory cytokine, IL -10, which (IFN - and IL-12) detected in Pru:cdpk2 -vaccinated pregnant mice infected with Pru cysts on day 12 of gestation (Figure 7) may have contributed to better pregnancy outcomes when compared to non-vaccinated + Pru-infected pregnant mice. Hig her IL -10 levels appear to play a role in protection against infection, because IL -10-deficient mice died during acute T. gondii infection due to a strong Th1 inflammatory response [47]. Previous studies showed that pregnancy outcomes can be improved in T. gondii -infected mice by administration of recombinant IL -10 and can be worsened in IL -10-deficient mice [48]. Despite the inhibitory effect of maternal and fetal Th2 polarized immune response that occurs during pregnancy on Th1 cytokine production , vaccin ation seems to elicit a protective immune response that enabled the pregnant mice to control the infection. These results show that vaccination of mice with Pru: cdpk2 achieved a critical balance between Th1 and Th2 responses for optimal control of infection , while minimizing overt inflammation and severe pathology. Although the immune responses induced by Pru: cdpk2 vaccination cannot completely block the vertical transmission, a statistically lower brain cyst burden was observed in pups from Pru: cdpk2 -vaccinated + Pru -infected dams, compared to pups of non -vaccinated + Pru-infected dams. In addition, there were significantly less numbers of brain cysts in Pru: cdpk2 -vaccinated + Pru -infected dams than dams. Also, neonates born to Pru: cdpk2 -vaccinated + Pru -infected dams had similar body weights to neonates born to non -vaccinated + uninfected mice.
