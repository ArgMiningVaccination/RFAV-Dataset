It is not designed to assess fitness to practise, which universities will assess in other ways. The test results are intended to be used as one component of the selection decision in conjunction with other information available to admissions tutors. Test items draw upon general academic skills and basic science knowledge, rather than recent specialist teaching. The test provides an objective basis for comparing candidates from different backgrounds, including mature applicants and those from different countries. The test is designed to be challenging in order to differentiate effectively between able applicants for university courses, including those who might have achieved the highest possible grades in school examinations. Qualities to be assessed Knowledge Familiarity with concepts, terms and knowledge typically covered by non-specialist courses in Science and Mathematics, usually taught in secondary education. Skills Ability to: read formal English and follow written instruction s work quickly and accurately perform simple mental arithmetic read simple quantitative data presented numerically or graphically, and understand its straightforward meaning generalise from quantitative data, for example to interpret a trend, a pattern or a rate, and apply the generalisation to the particular or hypothetical context make logical inferences or deductions from textual information and quantitative data, and identify illogical inferences communicate knowledge, understanding, interpretation, inferences, arguments, deductions and predictions by the appropriate use of clear and concise written English and diagrams take approaches that are critical, evidence-based and that consider alternatives 3Structure of the test The test has three elements: a 60-minute test of Thinking Skills, a 30-minute test of Scientific Knowledge and Applications, and a 30-minute Writing Task. The structure of each of these three elements is outlined below. Example test papers are available at: https://www.admissionstesting.org/for-test-takers/bmat/preparing-for -bmat/ Section 1: Thinking Skills - 60 minutes This element tests generic skills often required for undergraduate study. The range of these, and the approximate balance between them in terms of the number of marks available, is outlined below. Questions are in multiple-choice format. Calculators may not be used. Number of Questions Problem Solving 16 Requires candidates to solve problems, using simple numerical operations. Problem solving requires the capacity to: select relevant information identify similarity determine and apply appropriate procedures Critical Thinking 16 Presents a series of logical arguments and requires respondents to: summarise conclusions draw conclusions identify assumptions assess the impact of additional evidence detect reasoning errors match arguments apply principles Total 32 4Section 2: Scientific Knowledge and Applications - 30 minutes Section 2 tests whether candidates have an appropriate level of core scientific knowledge and the ability to apply it. Questions will be restricted to material typically included in non-specialist Science and Mathematics courses in secondary education. The balance between the subject areas in terms of time and marks available is outlined below. Questions will be in multiple-choice format. Calculators may not be used. The Section 2 content specification is set out in the Assumed Subject Knowledge section of this document. Speed as well as accuracy is important in this section. There are no penalties for incorrect responses, only marks for correct answers, so candidates should attempt all 27 questions. Each question is worth one mark. Number of Questions Biology 7 Chemistry 7 Physics 7 Mathematics 6 Total 27 Section 3: Writing Task - 30 minutes A selection of three tasks will be available, from which one must be chosen. These will include brief questions based on topics of general, scientific or medical interest. Questions will provide a short proposition and may require candidates to consider one of the following tasks. Explanation of the proposition: candidates are asked to explain the proposition or part of it, or its implications. Generation of a counter -argument: candidates are asked to look at the other side of the argument by proposing or commenting on a counter -argument or counter -proposition. Reconciliation of the two sides: candidates are asked to offer some sort of resolution or reconciliation for two opposing positions (or elements of those positions) explored in the answer. The Writing Task provides an opportunity for candidates to demonstrate the capacity to consider different aspects of a proposition, and to communicate them effectively in writing. Whilst candidates may make preliminary notes, answers are strictly limited to one A4 page, to promote the disciplined selection and organisation of ideas, together with their concise, accurate and effective expression. Dictionaries or electronic spell -checkers are not permitted. 5When scoring responses, consideration will be given to the degree to which candidates have: addressed the question in the way demanded; organised their thoughts clearly; expressed themselves using concise, compelling and correct English; used their general knowledge and opinions appropriately. Admitting institutions will be provided with a copy of the candidate's response. Test format There will be separate question papers for each of Sections 1, 2 and 3. With the exception of the Writing Task (Section 3), all questions are in multiple-choice format. Each multiple-choice question is worth one mark. Scoring and reporting For both Thinking Skills (Section 1) and Scientific Knowledge and Applications (Section 2), answer sheets are scanned and verified, followed by automated marking, psychometric analysis, test calibration and the issuing of results. For Sections 1 and 2, scores will be reported (to one decimal place) on a 9-point BMAT scale. The Writing Task (Section 3) is marked by Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing examiners. Scores are reported for the quality of content on a scale from 1 to 5, and for the quality of English on a scale from A to E. An image of the response will be supplied to each institution to which the candidate has applied. In addition to the scores, the task provides the institution with a basis for qualitative assessments of writing skills. 6BMA T Section 2: Assumed Subject Knowledge The material that follows outlines the scientific and mathematical knowledge assessed in BMAT Section 2. Questions may draw upon any aspects of the specification and may include topics from more than one specification area. Where mention is made of a particular quantity, knowledge of the SI unit of that quantity is also expected, including the relationship of the unit to other SI units through the equations linking their quantities. Candidates are expected to be familiar with the following SI prefixes: nano- giga- 109 Candidates are expected to be familiar with the use of negative indices in units, for example m s-1 for velocity.
