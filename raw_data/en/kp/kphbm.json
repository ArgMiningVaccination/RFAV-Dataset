Smoke used for sacred ceremony can be seen in all cultures across all time, with the basic element of fire relating to transformation. Smoke can symbolise our contact with the spiritual world, and is often used as a conduit to communicate and invoke spirits. We can find the symbolic use of smoke in many cultures. The use of smoke has been used amongst many primitive cultures as a way of releasing a dead body's soul on its journey. In a Viking funeral they would send their departed on a ship or raft out to the fjord, to initiate their journey into the afterlife. They would then fire flaming arrows at the ship until it caught a blaze and then witness the smoke carry their spirit up to Valhalla. The burning of some kind of substance, whether it be incense, herbs, sacred wood, or holy resins, can be found in all places of worship. Smoke will always have a place in spiritual ceremony no matter which culture, religion, spiritual practice, or indigenous group. Aboriginal births would include the mother crouching over a fire and then holding her baby in the smoke to seal its spirit in its mortal body. At each milestone in the child's life, it would be purified and sealed by the smoke again. The Native Americans use smoke to smudge, which is done to drive away sickness and bad energy, and help the people taking part in the ceremony to ground and center. Traditionally this was a pot filled with tobacco, sweetgrass, sage, and cedar. The smudge pot was fanned around the room so that the people could bathe in its healing, cleansing and spiritual qualities. In the Caribbean, cigar and tobacco smoke is puffed over the men by the Shaman to cleanse and strengthen them. Any smoke entering the body would take in with it the power of the spirit carried in the smoke. The Bible is full of references of using incense as a symbol of prayers rising up to god in heaven. It appears that the rising of the smoke appears to be worshipped for its ability to rise up to the heavens. Hari Krishnas believe cow dung to be a purification agent, and so they will burn it along with sugar mixed with any of the following; Sandalwood, camphor, musk, agrur or frankincense. Aboriginal sacred smoking ceremonies are very much a part of our Australian culture, and has many purposes. It is often used as a welcome ceremony and shows a sign of respect for people past and present. ANCIENT PRACTICES As many of us feel a desire to shift from our modern western culture, and reclaim the memory and essence of our deeper selves, we are becoming more and more attracted to ancient practices.Sacred Smoke has the power to transform and deflect unwanted energy, bless a space as sacred, and connect you to your higher self.

Whether it be fire, herbs, resins, incense or sacred woods, each smoke has its own healing powers and specific uses, and carries with it the unique signature of the cultures that honour and it. SMUDGING Herbs, resins and woods are often used in the form of a [smudge](https://www.happyherbshop.com.au/search?q=smudge*&type=article,page,product), and burned in a sacred bowl, often an abalone shell.

Smudging is often a crucial first step to any ceremony or ritual, to purify, cleanse and to invoke the spirits you wish to work with. It always brings a sense of sacredness and presence! How to smudge - Light one end of your smudge stick, wood, or resin particles, and allow it to catch fire and begin to smoke. If the flame doesn't naturally extinguish, waft it with your hand or moving the bowl. It is important not to blow on the smudge as this puts your energy onto it. Traditionally a feather or birds wing is used to fan the smoke and direct it on the person or space you wish to cleanse.
