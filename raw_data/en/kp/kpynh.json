Updated 10 August 2023 What's on this page Top questions Covid-19 booster side effects Top questions Who is being offered a Covid-19 booster? [The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/jcvi-advises-on-eligible-groups-for-2023-autumn-booster) has recommended that people at high risk of serious disease should be offered a Covid-19 booster dose this autumn. This includes: - residents in a care home for older adults - all adults aged 65 years and over - people aged 6 months to 64 years in a clinical risk group, such as people who are pregnant or immunosuppressed (a full list is laid out in the [Covid-19 Immunisation Green Book](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1153300/Greenbook-chapter-14a-26April2023.pdf)) - frontline health and social care workers - people aged 12 to 64 years who are household contacts of someone who is immunosuppressed (as detailed in the Green Book) - people aged 16 to 64 years who are carers or staff working in care homes for older adults (as detailed in the Green Book). These groups will also be eligible for a first and second dose of a Covid-19 vaccine if they haven't had them yet. If you're eligible for a booster dose, you should be contacted by the NHS. How long does the booster last, and how effective is it? [Research published in the Lancet in July 2023](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(23)00365-1/fulltext) looked at how effective a third dose of the monovalent vaccine is at preventing hospitalisation from Covid-19. In people aged 65 or over, the vaccine was 50% effective at preventing serious illness, for up to six months after a third dose. More than a year (14 months) after vaccination, the effectiveness was still about the same level. In people aged 18 to 64 years, the vaccine was 30% effective after six months. The research also looked at the effectiveness of the autumn 2022 bivalent booster. Having this booster meant that two to four weeks later, people aged 50 years and older had an extra 53% protection compared to those who didn't have it. Additionally, [a study published in The Lancet in April 2023](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(23)00122-6/fulltext) found that people over 65 who had the bivalent booster were 72% less likely to need a hospital visit and 68% less likely to die from Covid-19, compared to people over 65 who did not receive a bivalent booster. How long does it take for the booster to be effective? Studies have shown very high protection begins one or two weeks after receiving the booster jab. A [ trial by Pfizer](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-phase-3-trial-data-showing) suggests that from seven days onwards, a booster dose of Pfizer is extremely effective at preventing illness from Covid-19. I am immunosuppressed or immunocompromised, can I have a booster? The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has recommended that everyone over 6 months with a weakened immune system has an autumn booster. This includes people whose immune systems do not work properly due to disease or treatment. For example, organ transplant recipients, those taking steroids, or cancer patients who are having chemotherapy. See Table 3 of the Covid-19 Immunisation Green Book for a full list. What is a dual vaccine, or Omicron booster? Updated versions of the [Pfizer](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pfizerbiontech-bivalent-covid-19-booster-approved-by-uk-medicines-regulator) and [Moderna ](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-bivalent-covid-19-booster-vaccine-approved-by-uk-medicines-regulator#:~:text=An%20updated%20version%20of%20the,regulator's%20standards%20of%20safety%2C%20quality)vaccines have been approved for use in the UK. These updated vaccines are 'bivalent' vaccines, which means they offer protection against both the original coronavirus, as well as the Omicron variant BA.1. You might also see them referred to as a vaccine', 'dual variant vaccine' or 'Omicron that trial participants for its bivalent vaccine had antibody levels against Omicron subvariants (mutations of the Omicron BA.1 variant) that were 1.7 times higher than those who received the original booster. It's unclear at this point what this increase in antibodies means in terms of protection against the virus. The [Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)'s guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/jcvi-publishes-advice-on-covid-19-vaccines-for-autumn-booster-programme) is that getting any Covid jab is more important than receiving a particular vaccine.

Side effects of the booster are likely to be mild and short-lived. They often include things like pain or tenderness where you had the injection, fatigue, and headache. - For more information about the side effects of Covid-19 vaccines, please visit the [NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/safety-and-side-effects/). What are the side effects of the Moderna booster? Side effects for the Moderna vaccine when used as a booster include pain or tenderness where you had the injection, swelling of the lymph nodes in the arm where you had the injection, tiredness, headache, muscle or joint pain, chills, nausea, vomiting, fever, or rash. These side effects are similar whether you have the Moderna bivalent vaccine (also known as Omicron booster) or the original Moderna vaccine. If you do experience side effects, these are likely to be mild and last no more than a few days. What are the side effects of the Pfizer booster? Symptoms for the Pfizer booster may include pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle and joint pain, fever and chills. The side effects may be milder after a booster than after previous doses. Research from the UK [COV-Boost](https://www.covboost.org.uk/) trial suggests that Pfizer as a booster could have fewer side effects than Moderna, although there were some differences between different groups (see [what are the side effects of the Moderna booster?](#modernaeffects)) Is myocarditis more common after the booster vaccine? Myocarditis and pericarditis are very rare side effects of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. [Data published by the UK Health Security Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccination-myocarditis-and-pericarditis-information-for-healthcare-professionals/information-for-healthcare-professionals-on-myocarditis-and-pericarditis-following-covid-19-vaccination) (UKHSA) shows that myocarditis and pericarditis are less common after a booster jab, than after the first two doses of the vaccine, and this risk is already very small.
