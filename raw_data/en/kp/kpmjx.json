ABSTRACT Background and Objectives: This survey is conducted to understand the attitude of the population towards vaccination for COVID-19. Perception regarding COVID -19 vaccination such as efficacy, duration of protection, etc can affect the affinity of the population for readiness, enthusiasm, and willingness. Materials and Methods: A qualitative cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey was conducted during December 2020 and January 2021 in the Chhattisgarh province of India. A bilingual questionnaire consisted of questions on belief, willingness, and attitude to receive future COVID-19 vaccination was developed. The non-probability purposive sample of 1717 respondent (1026 responded online while 691 responses offline) were chosen in this study. Results: 60% and 40% of respondents were male and female respectively. 51.4% of respondents belonged to 31-40 years of age. 46.1 % of respondents believe that COVID-19 vaccine can prevent COVID-19 illness. In 82% of respondents, willingness was observed for COVID-19 vaccination, and willingness was highly dependent on literacy and qualification. Data support a good belief and willingness of the people from Chhattisgarh province towards the COVID-19 vaccination. Conclusion: The current study annuls the illusion and future hesitancy towards vaccination drive. The government must consider vaccine attributes like cost, the nation of vaccine origin, vaccine booth distances and attitude of the population like education status, occupation, socio-economic status, previous vaccination experience should also be undertaken for the largest single vaccine drive.
