Get Strong! Nature is a numbers game. We need all the support we can get as our immune systems and health are under assault from pollution, stress, contaminated food and age-related diseases... - Paul Stamets September marks the annual passage from fun beach days and relaxed minds to packed schedules and time management woes. Whether or not you are actually back in the classroom, September brings about a drastic change in routine. No more lazy, unregimented days; we are back to the grind. Full work weeks, projects, deadlines, meetings, homework, practice, workouts and more. Getting back into the routine can be stressful! If you add this stressful change to your existing daily environmental stressors - air quality, harsh cleaning products, artificial ingredients, genetically modified foods, allergens, etc. -your immune system takes a big hit! But, building up your immune system and keeping it strong is as easy as the alphabet. The whole alphabet of vitamins and minerals, from A to Zinc, assist the immune system directly and indirectly. Here are five of the top vitamins for strengthening your immune system. Vitamin A - You may already know vitamin A is key to healthy vision. Did you know it is also a strong antioxidant that kicks the immune system into high gear? Our bodies can make vitamin A from carotenoids in our diet. Carotenoids, including beta-carotene, are plant pigments that give some fruits and vegetables their orange color. Adding carotenoid rich foods to your September dishes will help boost immunity. Great sources of these vitamin A precursors include cantaloupe, carrots, pumpkin, sweet potato and squash. Vitamin B6 - Vitamin B6 is necessary for almost 200 biochemical reactions in the body! Without adequate intake, daily functioning of the body starts to decline. Although the biochemical reactions may not all relate specifically to immunity, a decline in function anywhere in the body stresses the immune system. Research has also indicated that deficiency in vitamin B6 may depress the immune system. Including foods rich in B6 can reduce your risk of less than optimal functioning and keep the immune system humming along. Great sources of Vitamin B6 include bananas, chicken breast, chickpeas, potatoes and tuna. Vitamin C - Ah, yes, vitamin C. It has been well known for decades that this vitamin is one of the greatest defenders of the immune system. Many of us have guzzled orange juice or popped a vitamin C chewable when feeling a cold coming on. It is such an immune powerhouse for many reasons. Vitamin C increases the production of white blood cells and antibodies, the policemen of the immune system, fighting to keep your body safe from harm. It also increases levels of interferon, boosting the immune response to any unwelcome attack. Possibly most important, it helps to recharge spent vitamin E, another potent immunity booster. Incorporate vitamin C rich foods into your daily nutrition for your best defense. Great food sources of vitamin C include bell peppers, broccoli, brussel sprouts, citrus fruits, kiwi, papaya and strawberries. Vitamin E - As previously mentioned vitamin C is needed to recharge spent vitamin E. But why is vitamin E so important for immunity? It is the production master of some very important immune cells - natural killer cells and B-cells. Natural killer cells assist the body by killing cancer cells; B-cells produce antibodies that destroy bacteria in the body. Vitamin E stimulates production of both of these potent immune cells. Ensuring you have adequate vitamin E in your diet helps you ward off any attack to your health. Great food sources of vitamin E include almonds, avocados, spinach, sunflower seeds and wheat germ. Zinc - This mineral adds to the power of vitamins C and E. Zinc works alongside vitamin C increasing the production of white blood cells and releasing antibodies to help fight infection. It also pairs well with vitamin E by increasing natural killer cells to fight cancer. Another added benefit of zinc is its control over inflammation. Stress can create inflammation in the body and weaken the immune system. Adding zinc rich foods to your meals and snacks is a great way to reduce the influence of stress on the body and strengthening the immune system. Great food sources of zinc include chickpeas, cashews, lamb, oysters, pumpkin seeds and wheat germ. Two foods that are damaging to immunity are refined sugar and fried foods. Both have a suppressive effect on the immune system. A high sugar intake can also reduce the amount of vitamin C you actually absorb, further compromising immune health. Fried foods not only depress the immune system, they also increase inflammation which increases stress on the immune system. Eating a whole foods diet while avoiding refined sugar and fried foods will bring your immunity to Herculean strength. Lifestyle can also be a strong influence on immunity. Exercise is a great way to increase your immune system, as is adequate recovery from your workouts to avoid burnout. Quality sleep and reducing stress are two other important aspects to a healthy immune system. During this transition into a more hectic and stressful routine focus on increasing whole foods, exercise, recovery and sleep, and reducing sugars, fried foods and stress as best you can. Follow these tips and you will have a fighting chance when cold and flu "}
