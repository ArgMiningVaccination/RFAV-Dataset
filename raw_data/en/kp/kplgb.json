And finally it seems as if I have found a missing piece. One of them at least. And that is having a healthy routine that works Being a highly [Vaata person i hate routines.](https://adakomani.no/ayurvedisk-konsultasjon/) I am the happiest when i am travelling and exploring without a clock. At the same time I know that I feel best when i am stable and grounded. After many years of searching and studying different methods i have finally come up with a daily routine that has brought a lot of much needed stability in my life. It might seem challenging at first, but once you have embodied it, it just flows and you don't even need to think about it. I am sharing my daily routine here with the hope that you might find it easy to integrate it into your day. Morning routine - Wake up and sit up as soon as possible (otherwise I will go back to sleep) - Close my eyes and contemplate on everything that is beautiful. Maybe give myself a hug from time to time. Or just hold my palms on my chest and think of gratitude and hold that feeling in my heart. Or If i have time i do listen to a short meditation such as this one from Abraham Hicks: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RZ8n86CmJg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RZ8n86CmJg) Even though i am able to meditate on my own, i find it useful to have guidance early in the morning. 3. Get up and put the coffee machine on (it is ready from the night before so all i need to do is switch a button). I love the smell of coffee :). And of course if you are a tea lover prepare tea 4. Toilet duty :). If you have been eating properly and there is no disturbance in your digestion then you should be able to move the bowels early in the morning. 5. Oil my entire body - I know that this step sounds time consuming but it literally takes 2 minutes to apply oil on your skin. The oil you choose depends on your dosha. More on this later. 6. Perform Jala Neti. This is the application of saline water on one nostril at a time. It is very useful especially during winter as it lowers Vaata and prevents the accumulation of Kapha dosha. 7. 1 minute or less Kapalbhati 8. Apply 2 drops of oil in each nostril. There are different ayurvedic oils you can find out there. The one i use is Anu Thalam. 9. Oil pulling with the mouth. This is the process of holding oil in your mouth. I use organic coconut oil. 10. Shower (i usually do not wash my hair in the morning, but if you do then apply oil to your hair when you apply the body oil). 11. Spit the oil from my mouth and brush the teeth. I use ayurvedic toothpaste. Twice a week I do tongue scraping which helps in removing extra particles from your tongue. 12. Apply Kajal under my eyes and roll them. This is part of the ayurvedic eye care. [Here is a video on preparing kajal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1YOgOL982A). Nevertheless it is possible to buy kajal and have it delivered at home :). 13. Cream the face and add any other beauty routines. I use essential oils instead of perfume :). Sandal wood is one of my favorites. 14. Get dressed 15. Squeeze half a lemon and add warm water to it. Lemon water is the first thing i drink in the morning. I also take the following pills in the morning: a vegan pill, B12, Triphala, Brahmi and Collagen. 16. A tea spoon of honey (organically grown from my parents) 17. Coffee time This is a sacred time. I use 5 minutes to day dream about all the wonderful things that are going to come into my life :): The whole thing does not take more than 40 minutes (even less sometimes). Having a morning routine has changed my life. It is so important because it sets up the tone for the day. 18. Yoga practice including some pranayama (more on this in the future). And of course sometimes this can be at the end or middle of the day depending on when i am teaching. 19. I do not enjoy breakfast but it is very important for me as a Vaata person. So after my yoga practice I do eat something small or just get a smoothie (not with milk because mixing milk and fruit leads to indigestion). Middle of the day Go on with my day Usually this means teaching and admin work. So I have quite an active day. Nevertheless i do not forget to just stop and breath when i need to (sometimes even if i feel i don't really need to, because at the end of the day we always need a minute to come back to ourselves). 20. Lunch is important: As a Vaata i try to avoid salads (unless that is my healthiest option). I go instead for some warm food. And even if i do not have time i do make time to sit in a quiet and undisturbed zone and eat. Evening 21. Dinner is usually after teaching and at home. I have made it into a habit of having an idea of what i am going to eat. Usually it is pretty simple, such as baked veggies and roots and tofu (as a Vaata person i cannot have beans). As long as i get the vitamins I need and it tastes good and it is warm food I am happy. 22. Meditation Or/and watching something (check out Gaia), relaxing, praying... it all depends on your personal preference, as long as it is something that leads to you unwiring 23. Maybe another shower 24. Brush teeth 25. Wash face and apply oil / cream. I use Kukumandi oil. 26. Switch off wifi and PC 27. I take magnesium and drink chamomile tea around 1 hr before sleep. 28. Self-healing 29. Sleep by latest 10pm (or before) That's it people. I know that this daily routine might seem overwhelming at first, but once you are in the routine it is sooo amazing that you will thank me for this. And if it feels like too much as yourself, what is more important than you to yourself? Let me know if you have any questions Until next time Much love Ada "}
