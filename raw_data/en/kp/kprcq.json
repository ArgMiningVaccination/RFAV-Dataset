I h ad not seen her for a week . A c hief resident in China is required to work in the hospital 24 hours a day, six days a week, for six months during the PGY-4 year . T he emergency room (ER) attending requested an urgent consultation for a suicidal patient . T here was no crisis worker in the ER, so I was responsible for all urgent consultations . I j umped out of bed and rushed to the ER, which was 1 .2 ki lometers away from my office . H ospital policy required the psychiatry chief resident to see any emergent consult within 15 minutes after receiving a phone call; otherwise the chief resident was responsible for any outcome, including the patient's death . A f ormer chief resident told me the story of a patient on the internal medicine unit who jumped off the tenth floor two minutes before she arrived . D espite the sad and unfortunate outcome, the resident was not held responsible because she arrived at the inpatient unit 14 minutes after receiving the consulta-tion request . B eing the chief resident for six months was the most stressful time of my psychiatry residency in China - not just because of the long clinical hours, but because of the separation from my family . I w as either working or sleep- ing for 24 hours, six days per week in the hospital, with very limited time to take a break . E very resident in every specialty in the hospital had to survive this grueling training before becoming an attending . U nfortunately, there was no house officer association protecting the residents or negotiating on our behalf . H owever, this experience improved my competency dramatically because of the large volume of patients encountered and the level of responsibility I had for those patients . Brief Overview of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (CAP) Training in China There was no CAP fellowship available in China in 2008, so I worked in the CAP inpatient unit during the first six months of my PGY4 year and as chief resident during the second six months . The re are fewer than 500 qualified child psychiatrists in China .1 CAP services are only available in the capital cities and the populous municipalities . C hina began standardized psychiatry residency training in 2014 .2 The West China Hospital at Sichuan University is the largest single-site hospital in China with more than 4,800 inpatient beds and 7,800 medical staff . E stablished in 1938, the Mental Health Center (MHC) in the Hospital is the first mental health institute in western China and one of four key mental health centers in mainland China . A lthough my residency experience is not generalizable to other residencies, it is a good example of how most psychiatry residencies in China's big teaching hospitals work . Be cause I have always been extremely interested in CAP, I chose to work in the inpatient CAP unit as a junior attending, interviewing new patients and creating the treatment plans . I p rovided psycho - therapy for several patients . I d id research on social anxiety disorder for young adults and successfully published several manuscripts . I w orked on an outpatient service two afternoons per week from PGY2 to PGY4 . E ach resident had a 4-hour long outpatient clinic per half day, capped by 20 outpatients . M ost of the afternoons, I saw six to ten patients . Be cause of the shortage of CAPs in China, I decided to come to the United States to learn more about research and clinical practice in child and adoles-cent psychiatry . N ow I am a first year attending in the outpatient clinic at the University of Utah . I w anted to com- pare my training experience in China and the United States with the hope to improve the understanding of training on both sides, and to build collaboration between the two countries . Comparison of the Training Experiences in the Two Countries The United States has well-established requirements for both general psychia-try residency and CAP fellowship . M y first-year fellowship consists of four months of consult-liaison, three months of inpatient service, and five months of residential treatment center rotations . T he second-year fellowship consists of a large variety of outpatient services, including specialized populations . Pr ograms in China and the United States gave me high quality training in psychiatry but through very differ-ent approaches . W est China Hospital at Sichuan University offered many research opportunities which included funding from the hospital and govern-ment . T he training also involved a tremendous patient workload . C hina began the process of modeling general psychiatry residency training programs after the United States in 2003, and psychiatric training with similarities to Western medicine have become more and more popular . I t may take a while for China to develop subspecialty Rong Xiao, MD, PhD, and Douglas Gray, MDCOLUMNS6 AACAP NEWSfellowships because of financial stress experienced by trainees, due to very limited income, the uncertainty regard-ing their future, and the higher work demand on Chinese physicians com-pared to U .S . r esidents . T his is outlined in Table 1 . Social and Cultural Influences on Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Practice It is important to mention several cultural and social influences in China which impact CAP . F irst, Buddhism and Daoism are the most popular reli-gions and influence culture . T herefore, Chinese patients may feel their mental suffering results from retributions of sins from their previous or current lives . F amily members' support and religious rituals are extremely important for people's mental health . Second, the one- child policy from 1979 to 2015 has had a tremendous influence on family dynam-ics, education, and social resources . I t caused an unbalanced sex ratio because of the cultural preference of male over female . S poiled by four grandparents and two parents, the only child has less empathy and social skills but more responsibilities to take care of the aging grandparents . T hird, the growing migration of workers from rural to urban areas in China has resulted in many chil-dren being left behind to be raised by their grandparents or relatives . F ourth, most government and private insur-ances only cover inpatient treatment . T herefore, patients use inpatient services more often than outpatient services in order to reduce costs . O ne aspect where I believe China provides better services than the United States is in accessible and affordable psychiatric outpatient services; it costs 5 to see a psychiatry resident and 20 to see an attending . A lthough the patient has to self-pay for the outpatient visit, the intake assess-ment and the follow up appointment charge the same amount of money for a 30-minute appointment . ( Note: 1 = $0 .15 . A s ingle person's monthly cost in Chengdu, China, was 3,254 .16 ($488 .12 ) without rent in 2018 .) Ps ychiatry is growing fast in China, and growing pains are expected . I ts growth has been impressive due to the hard work and devotion of many mental health professionals . C ollaborations between the United States and China can be mutually rewarding for American psychiatrists interested in global health, as well as Chinese psychiatrists looking to incorporate the best of Western and Eastern mental health treatments . mReferences 1 .

She endorsed poor concentration, constant worries about her grades, feeling tense, irritable, and worsening sleep. Sleep initiation has been particularly trouble-some with \"racing thoughts\" about her academic progress and then being \"exhausted and irritable\" in the morning since she has to get up early for school after only five to six hours of sleep. She is on Lexapro for generalized anxiety and has tried trazodone, Benadryl, and melatonin in the past, but she reports these trials have either been ineffective, without lasting results, or made her feel groggy. She asks for non-pharmacologic treatment options and hopes there is something that \"I can do on my own without meds.\" Sleep is an essential part of physical and emotional health and balance, and sleep issues are significantly associated with psychiatric disorders and emotional and behavior problems . C hildren and adolescents need at least nine hours of sleep per night . Y et the majority of teens, 53-70%, are getting less than eight hours on school nights, and approximately 30-36% endorse insomnia symptoms .1-3 The issues of sleep during adolescence are unique and Crowley et . a l . d escribes this period as a \"Perfect Storm\" - a time where both intrinsic (sleep homeostasis and circadian physiology) and extrinsic factors (societal and cultural pressures) collide leaving youth sleep deprived .4 Insufficient sleep has implications for academic performance, interpersonal relationships, emotional and behav-ioral regulation, and cognitive adverse outcomes . F urther, some studies suggest that sleep problems are associated with suicidal ideation and attempts, and precede the development of anxiety and depression in adolescents .5-7 It is well established that cognitive behavioral therapies for insomnia (CBT-I) and mindfulness based sleep interven-tions, light therapy, and chronotherapy are effective treatments for adult sleep disorders .8,9 Several meta-analyses of CBT-I for chronic insomnia have dem-onstrated medium-to-large effect sizes for sustainably improving various sleep parameters (sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, and sleep quality) in adults . T his improve- ment has been demonstrated for primary insomnia as well as for insomnia that exists alongside comorbid medical and psychiatric disorders .10,11 The American College of Physicians (ACP), in a 2016 practice guideline, recommended that all adults with chronic insomnia receive CBT-I as first line treatment .12 Conversely, the adolescent literature remains limited, and general psychoedu-cational sleep hygiene programs geared toward the general student population have not improved sleep behaviors or mental health outcomes .2,8 However, Blake et . a l . f ound that a CBT-I and mindfulness based sleep intervention was effective in at-risk adolescents, those already experiencing subclinical and clinical symptoms of anxiety and depression .2 Additionally, there is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that found CBT-I effective and another RCT that found CBT-I plus bright light therapy improved self-reported and objective sleep as well as functional (anxiety and depression) outcomes in adolescents with a primary sleep disorder .9,13 Beyond the general adolescent popula-tion, the youth admitted to an inpatient psychiatric unit overwhelmingly report symptoms of sleep disorders . W hile there are limited studies and protocols to systematically target sleep complaints within an acute care context, the struc-tured hospital setting offers a rich forum to both collect objective sleep data and begin treatment and psychoeducation to address sleep related issues . T he inpatient milieu is organized with consis-tent rules and routines which schedule wake/bedtime and meals, control light variables, permit/prohibit screen time, objectively record amount/time of sleep (15 minute checks), and facilitate a variety of therapeutic groups and activities which can be targeted toward sleep related issues . T he five core CBT-I components consist of sleep hygiene education and instruction, stimulus control, sleep restriction, relaxation training, and cognitive therapy .8 While not all core concepts may be addressed, many of these CBI-I techniques can be incorporated within the frame of an inpatient hospitalization . Sl eep diaries can be important tools in sleep interventions . S leep logs offer valu - able information about an individual's timing, quality, and patterns of sleep . I n a hospital setting, the data from a patient's sleep diar can be compared to the objective information documented by staff who log sleep/awake activity every 15 minutes throughout the night . A ccurate patterns of sleep can be identi- fied and discrepancies explored to help inform treatment goals . Hun Millard, MD, and Benjamin Yu, MDCOLUMNS8 AACAP NEWSSleep Hygiene Specific routines and instructions are provided to patients on an inpatient unit, including consistent wake/bed times and predictable pre-sleep as well as wake-up routines . P romoting evening \"wind down\" activities with low light levels and soothing music encourages sleep readiness . W hile mornings are struc- tured to maximize light from windows, scheduled coffee and breakfast times as well as staff offerings of additional hygiene products aim to stimulate wake-fulness . P sychoeducation is provided in multiple ways, ranging from direct individual instruction to written literature and group/activity modalities . G iven that adolescents often benefit from more active engagement and participation, groups can be created to incorporate discussion with worksheets, videos, and games . F or example, Sleep Hygiene Bingo Group incorporates a Bingo board (picture 1) which covers broad sleep hygiene topics (e .g . c hocolate, exercise, temperature, etc .), a nd as the game progresses each topic is processed within the group and typically spurs a lively discussion . Stimulus Control Instructions are provided to patients about only using the bed for sleep and not napping; these behavioral recommendations aim to improve a conditioned association with the bed to promote sleep . W hen there is an in vivo opportunity, the staff provide in-the-moment direct feedback to patients to avoid naps or do non-sleep activities out of bed . T hus, all rooms are furnished with a window and dimmers to regulate light, and a desk and chair to offer an alternative space for non-sleep activities . Sleep Restriction On the inpatient unit, it may be difficult to incorporate sleep restriction within a hospital milieu schedule . T he goal of sleep restriction technique is to promote homeostatic drive to achieve 85% or greater sleep efficiency (defined as the ratio of the total time spent asleep at night compared to the total time spent in bed) .8 It is plausible to incorporate this technique if patients have a single room or otherwise do not disrupt the thera-peutic milieu; however, thoughtful and cautious consideration of comorbidities and adverse outcomes of restricting sleep is vital . Relaxation A variety of relaxation techniques can be taught, practiced, and utilized to reduce cognitive and physiologic arousal and promote sleep . M any inpatient units already have relaxation groups . O ur unit offers a daily afternoon group called \"Sensory Modulation and Relaxation Group\" which encompasses a variety of activities including yoga, medita-tion, seven senses, progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery, and deep breathing skills . Cognitive Therapy Within CBT-I, cognitive therapy aims to explore negative thought processes and negative beliefs about sleep by focusing on ruminations and worries that occur at bedtime . I t assists in identifying and then challenging negative thoughts about sleep, unrealistic expectations of sleep, and catastrophic thinking and fears about missing out on sleep .8 The skills learned from inpatient CBT groups can be generalized and practiced to target specific issues with sleep .Conclusion As in any intervention, the firm founda-tion of psychoeducation is a beginning point . I n an acute care setting, psycho- education can be provided in a group or individual format and should not be limited to sleep hygiene; adolescents are curious about their development, biology, and physiology . M otivational interviewing can be incorporated to improve engagement . I dentifying areas of investment such as improving academic performance, interpersonal relationships (via better emotion and behavioral regulation), improv-ing stress management, and physical/health benefits (e .g . a cne, obesity) may be areas to promote greater treatment investment . T he inpatient setting offers a captive audience of both patients and families, who serve as a powerful ally in helping adolescents . Sl eep is a common and important adolescent problem associated with many mental illnesses, an issue further exacerbated by normal adolescent physiologic changes, emotional devel - opment, technological pressures, and societal changes (e .g . e arly school times) .4 At the acute level of inpatient care, sleep difficulty is one of the most common symptoms and complaints . T he structured hospital setting offers an ideal environment to collect accurate sleep data as well as engage patients to actively take part in their treatment . W hile a hospital admission is brief, it offers a powerful opportunity to reset internal circadian rhythm, provide valu - able education, and teach and practice skills to promote balanced and healthy sleep habits . I t is important to note that while an inpatient hospitalization is a unique and potentially valuable start-ing point to begin psychoeducation and intervention for insomnia, it is in no way comprehensive, and coordination of care with outpatient providers is impera-tive to ongoing treatment . m References 1 .

Shrier, D.Eng, JD12 AACAP NEWS COMMITTEES/ASSEMBLYDIVERSITY AND CULTURE COMMITTEE How to Treat Unaccompanied Minors Separated at the Border Balkozar Adam, MD The zero-tolerance policy that forc- ibly separated migrant children from their parents at the border earlier this year was short-lived, but the traumatic effect it has on the children may last a lifetime . M ore than 2,600 children, classified as unaccompanied minors, were torn from their parents and transferred to the custody of the U .S . g overnment . A f ederal judge has ordered the children be reunited with their parents, but as of late August, more than 500 children remained separated from their parents .1 As psychiatrists, we are exceedingly concerned about the impact of the sepa-ration on the children and their families . S everal leading psychiatric and medical associations - including the American Academy of Child Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), the American Psychiatric Association (APA Psychiatric), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Medical Association (AMA), and the American Psychological Association (APA Psychological) - issued strong statements condemning the policy and calling for its end . \"W hen children experience sudden separation from one or both parents, especially under frightening, unpredict-able, and/or chaotic circumstances, they are at heightened risk for developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, and other trauma-related reactions that may last for the rest of their lives,\" AACAP's statement read .2 AACAP officials highlighted the undue harm the separation placed on children who are already vulnerable . T he families crossing the U .S .-M exico border often are fleeing war and violence in their home countries and, even before they reach the United States, must cope with the related effects of stress and trauma . H ighly stressful experiences, like family separation, can cause irreparable harm, which can disrupt children's brain archi - tecture and affect their development, AAP officials emphasized . T his type of prolonged exposure to serious stress - known as toxic stress - can carry lifelong consequences for children . Du ring the 2018 AMA Annual Meeting, delegates discussed how the zero-tolerance policy can cause great harm to children and their families, who are compelled to make a dangerous and uncertain journey largely out of concerns of safety for their children . I n a letter to federal officials, the AMA's CEO wrote that childhood trauma and adverse experiences \"created by inhumane treatment often create negative health impacts that can last an individual's entire lifespan .\"3 Similarly, the president of the APA said the policy threatened the mental and physical health of the children and their caregivers . \" The longer that children and parents are separated, the greater the reported symptoms of anxiety and depression for the children,\" 4 she wrote . T hat leads to negative outcomes including psychologi-cal distress, academic difficulties, and developmental disruptions . If t he children are not already in the care of a mental health professional, they may soon be . P sychiatrists and mental health professionals need to apply a cultural lens when treating them, making sure we are aware of the child's cultural beliefs and values . E mploying a culturally-sensi- tive approach during treatment promotes the child's culture while bridging their understanding of their illness with ours . E ven in 2018, we cannot discount the power of stigma in keeping children from seeking mental health care . W e must combat that at every turn . I n addition, this population - which is already mar-ginalized - may fear that seeing a mental health professional could isolate them further and even jeopardize their immi-gration case . T his may affect the child's willingness to seek or remain engaged in treatment . The se children likely are already suf- fering from immigration-related loss or trauma . T hey endured overwhelming stress during the pre-migration, migra-tion, and post migration periods, from violence in their home countries to separation upon arrival . T he uncer- tainty of the future only exacerbates that issue, as does the sense of limbo they face waiting to know if they will be deported . S pecifically, these children are at a higher risk for depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, conduct disorder, and substance abuse disorder . H owever, they may express their symp- toms through somatic patterns or other indirect means - something psychiatrists should watch for . The u se of DSM-5 's Cultural Formulation and Cultural Formulation Interview may prove useful in these cases . A ACAP's Practice Parameter for Cultural Competence in Children and Adolescents 5 is a tool every psychiatrist should have in their toolkit . A mong the recommendations is enlisting an interpreter outside of the family if the child's primary language is not English . C onnecting the family with an agency that can help with transportation to and from appointments can go a long way in encouraging consistent participation in treatment . W hen available, the children often prefer clinics located within their ethnic community or clinics within school and community buildings, as opposed to hospitals . Che cking our own implicit biases is essential, albeit difficult . W e need to engage with our patients and listen to their individual stories . I t's easy to assume that we may know what they experienced based on articles we have JANUAR Y/FEBRUARY 2019 13 COMMITTEES/ASSEMBLYread about children crossing the border or even previous patients we have seen . W e should resist that urge and leave our preconceptions at the door . I t is also good to remember that these children typically come from collectivist cul-tures, so involving the extended family in treatment could improve treatment outcomes . Wi th that, however, we must emphasize confidentiality . M any young people, especially teenagers, may not feel comfortable sharing information with a psychiatrist if they think it will get back to their parents or other relatives . S ome of those family members may be dealing with their own stressors, so we need to be aware of acculturation stress and intergenerational accultura-tion conflict . D ocumenting the trauma, whether the child experienced it before or after arriving to the United States, also is important . R eport suspected abuse or neglect to child protective services, even if it occurred in the child's home country . U naccompanied minors are especially vulnerable to human trafficking . The c hallenges facing the children who were separated from their families do not end once they are released from the gov - ernment's custody . I n addition to treating those children who walk through our doors, we can make our voices heard . C ontacting our elected officials and media outlets raises awareness about the issue . I t also educates the public about the damage the separation caused and the continued struggles these children will face . P sychiatrists and mental health professionals should consider signing up for asylum evaluation . A s the situation continues to evolve, our goal of aid-ing these children in recovering from the harm they experienced remains the same . m References 1 . Barajas J .

Nestled in the tranquil mountains of Washington, less than an hour away from Seattle, one finds the facility aptly called reSTART: Serenity Mountain . A fi rst of its kind residential treatment facility for internet and video game addiction for teens in the United States, it is a short drive from its sister facility for young adults . \" Connecting people with what matters most - Life\" reads their mission state-ment, and it is not hard to see why after a personal tour given by one of their founders, Dr . H ilarie Cash, and admissions coordinator, Mr . Jo hnny Tock . V ideo game addiction is still not recognized as an official disorder in the United States, and the financial cost, which is not reimbursed by insurance, places this kind of treatment out of reach for many patients . H owever, demand is so great that reSTART has a wait-list for patients . T here was no waiting though for our group of 13 AACAP Media Committee and Substance Abuse Committee members who took a detour from AACAP's Annual Meeting in Seattle to visit the reSTART personal tour arranged by Paul Weigle, MD . The t our started off with meeting in one of the two residential houses . W e sat in a large living room, surrounded by guitars and other instruments scattered across the room that were left behind by the patients . I t is hard to imagine what gatherings resemble for under-socialized teens who have been glued to screens since the age of three . S ocial anxiety from deficits in skills and time spent with peers is quite evident in this popula-tion . T he multidisciplinary staff gave us a detailed description of their admission process, nature, and course of treatment and outcomes . Wit h the lack of motivation for inde- pendence, paralyzing fear of failure, poor work ethic, and personality traits of dependency, avoidance, schizotypal, narcissism, antisocial, and melancho - lia, most of the adolescents admitted to reSTART are coerced by parents into signing consent for treatment . W ashington state allows children 12 years and older to sign in voluntarily . D uring an initial detox period that lasts an average of three weeks, withdrawal symptoms, including emotional lability and aggression, are commonly experi-enced . T hereafter, the teens are able to start improving themselves and revers-ing the impact of chronic insomnia, unhealthy diet, and social isolation .

A ll patients participate in daily individual, group, and family therapy . A v isiting psychiatrist prescribes medication to address comorbid ADHD, depression, and anxiety symptoms . R esidents attend six hours of school every day, where they are slowly reintroduced to produc-tive use of screen media . T he average length of stay is 12 to 16 weeks, after which a gradual transition back into society is enacted . Gi ven the considerable cost of treat- ment (roughly $16,000 per month), there is a lack of socioeconomic diversity amongst residents of this for-profit facil-ity . T ypical patients come from higher income households, with well-educated parents who have high expectations . D uring treatment, an emphasis is placed on learning and maintaining personal hygiene and learning to schedule and prioritize school work . T reatment also focuses on building relationships with their parents and other family members . As ou r tour goes on, we witness breath- taking views of the mountain from the dorm-style rooms, hiking trails, swim-ming pool, gymnasium, rooms dedicated to art and play therapy, and well-supplied greenhouse, which together create a seemingly ideal environment for recovery . T he generous staff-to-patient ratio, adequate space, and structured schedule also support quality care . P atients are assessed for their readiness for discharge based on their stability on psychiatric medication as well as their ability to maintain school work, socialize with peers, practice coping skills, and communicate produc - tively with parents . T he staff report that immense changes in the residents' behaviors and self-confidence are typical . Ac cording to Dr . C ash, the brain requires two years to recover from the deleterious effects of video game addiction, so fol-lowing discharge she recommends youth abstain from video games for at least two years . T hereafter, she recommends a continued avoidance of high-intensity games and the games that were a part of their former addictive habit . As w e see a rise in excessive video game play in youth, and the accompa-nying prevalence of related behavioral problems and addictive habits, it will be invaluable for clinicians to have data on the effectiveness of interventions of this nature .

B etween 1999 and 2016, 632,331 indi- viduals died of a drug overdose in the United States, and the majority of these deaths involved opioids . Y oung people have also been affected; in 2016 alone, 4,070 young people ages 15 to 24 years died from an opioid related overdose . S ince substance use disorders (SUD) start in late adolescence, and childhood psychiatric disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and depression increase a young person's risk of developing a SUD, child psychiatrists can play an important role in changing the trajectory of the opioid epidemic . Assessment Most adolescents with a SUD do not view their substance use as a problem and do not volunteer this information unless asked specifically . I t is therefore important for providers to routinely screen all adolescents for substance use . T he National Institute on Drug Abuse recently made two validated, free adolescent substance screening instruments available online ( www. drugabuse.gov/adolescent-substance-use-screening-tools ) . S creening to Brief Intervention (S2BI) and the Brief Screener for Tobacco, Alcohol, and Other Drugs (BSTAD) are patient or clinician admin-istered and assess substance use in the past year . B oth instruments ask first about tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis use . I f an adolescent has not used any of these substances, no further ques-tions are required . I f an adolescent has used one of these substances, the clinician is prompted to ask about five other substances, including \"prescription drugs that were not prescribed for them,\" \"illegal drugs,\" \"inhalants,\" and \"herbs or synthetic drugs .\" If a n adolescent endorses any opioid use, it is important to assess further details including the type of opioid used since opioids vary considerably in potency . S ince prescription opioids have become less available for misuse recently, many individuals misusing opioids are using heroin and fentanyl . I f someone intended to use heroin and took a \"dose\" that they thought was safe based on the potency of heroin, but the substance was fentanyl which is approximately 50 times stronger, they are at high risk for an unintentional overdose and death . Whe n an adolescent is misusing opioids, other important variables to assess include the frequency of use, method of use [oral, intranasal, smoked, or intravenous (IV)], and the 11 DSM-5 SUD criteria . Wi thdrawal symptoms are important to monitor when start-ing medication to treat an OUD . T hey can be formally quantified with the Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale and commonly include insomnia, anxiety, irritability, mydriasis, diaphoresis, pain, or gastrointestinal upset . K nowing how the opioid was used is also critical since IV use has the highest risk of transmit-ting infectious diseases such as hepatitis C and HIV . T he prevalence of acute hepatitis C has increased in parallel with the number of opioid overdoses, and the highest incidence is among 20 to 29 year olds . L ikewise, a thorough assessment for co-occurring psychiatric disorders - especially depressed mood and suicid-ality - is important for adolescents with OUD since the prevalence of co-occur-ring psychiatric disorders is high .Treatment If an adolescent meets criteria for an OUD, medication - which decreases risk for overdose and death - should be dis-cussed . C urrently, three medications are FDA approved to treat OUD in adults: buprenorphine/naloxone, methadone, and naltrexone extended release . E ach has 1) a different mechanism of action at the opioid receptor, 2) evidence base for use in adolescents, 3) different route of administration, and 4) challenges with medication access . Wit h regard to mechanism of action, buprenorphine is a partial opioid recep-tor opioid urges and cravings to use opioids, prevent opioid withdrawal, and prevent the experience of pleasure if an opioid is taken when the agonist is active in their system . S ince buprenorphine is a partial ago- nist, an individual needs to have some symptoms of opioid withdrawal before starting the medication as they will experience sudden opioid withdrawal if they go from having an opioid receptor fully activated by an opioid to having an opioid receptor only partially activated by buprenorphine . S ince methadone is a full agonist, an individual can start this medication when they still have \"When an adolescent is misusing opioids, other important variables to assess include the frequency of use, method of use [oral, intranasal, smoked, or intravenous (IV)], and the 11 DSM-5 SUD criteria. Withdrawal symptoms are important to monitor when starting medication to treat an OUD.\" JANUAR Y/FEBRUARY 2019 19FEATURES opioids in their system . s an antagonist, naltrexone blocks activity at the opioid receptor and prevents an individual from experiencing pleasure if they use an opi-oid . T o start naltrexone, a patient must be off opioids for several days since they would experience symptoms of opioid withdrawal if they started an antagonist medication when opioids were still acti-vating the opioid receptor . Bu prenorphine/naloxone has the largest evidence base for use with adolescents with OUD . I t is a daily sublingual medi- cation that a provider who obtained an X license from the DEA can prescribe in the outpatient setting . T hree random- ized controlled trials demonstrated that buprenorphine is safe and effec-tive in adolescents 16 years and older who have a moderate or severe opioid use disorder .1-3 Naltrexone extended release is a once monthly intramuscular gluteal injection that often requires prior authorization . M ethadone is a daily oral solution that can only be obtained through highly structured methadone maintenance programs which often do not serve people under 18 . Ad olescents who have misused opioids and their families should be educated on signs of an opioid overdose - including sedation, decreased level of conscious-ness, slowed breathing, and cyanosis - and encouraged to get naloxone . W hen an individual stops breathing, overdoses become fatal . N aloxone is a short-acting opioid antagonist that can be administered intranasally, intravenously to temporarily reverse an opioid over-dose . I t is available by prescription in most states and has been increasingly made available for family members or other potential bystanders . T he \"Opioid Overdose Prevention Toolkit\" is a resource for providers, patients, communities available through SAMHSA ( In a ddition to medication, evidence- based therapy - such as motivational enhancement therapy with cognitive behavioral therapy (MET/CBT) - can help adolescents with SUD especially when their family is involved . M ET/ CBT engages youth in treatment by first building their motivation to change and then helping them build skills to help them be effective in making changes . W hen a young person is reluctant to come to treatment, providers can work with families to incentivize engagement in care with rewards and consequences . T he community reinforcement and family training protocol is a manualized treatment targeted to parents to help their child engage in SUD care . Summary Although integrating buprenorphine/naloxone and naltrexone extended release into your practice may feel chal - lenging, society needs more providers trained to work with youth with OUD and their families . P rovider training and support for treating OUD can be accessed for free from a SAMHSA funded project, the Provider Clinical Support System (PCSS) ( www.pcssnow. org) . P CSS can connect a provider with live waiver trainings and free webinars for CME credit on treating OUD and psychiatric and medical co-morbidity associated with SUD . P CSS has short videos where providers model how to discuss medication with patients . P CSS also offers free one-on-one mentor - ing with experts . A d ifferent SAMSHA project, the State Targeted Response-Technical Assistance Consortium, provides states and communities with help expanding OUD treatment into systems and practices (www.getSTR-TA.org ) . m References 1 - ments for opioid-dependent 05; .

S trong correlations have been found with depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disor-der, and oppositional defiant disorder . R esearch supports that childhood trauma is involved in the development of bipolar and psychotic disorders, or at the very least, increases the risk for a more severe and refractory course of illness . W hile most child and ado- lescent psychiatrists (CAPs) are aware that their patients have and are being exposed to potentially traumatic events (PTEs), adversity, and chronic stress, it is less clear that trauma and stress histories and symptoms are obtained or incorporated into treatment . T he Clinical Perspective, The Importance of Trauma and Adversity in the Treatment of Child Psychiatric Disorders , provided the rationale for making trauma and stress central to the practice of child and adolescent psychiatry .Li sa Amaya-Jackson, MD, MPH , Professor of Psychiatry at Duke University and Deputy Director of the National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN), presented Psychiatric Disorders in Youth Exposed to Trauma: Complexity and Synergy . S he reported on key findings from the NCTSN Core Data Set (CDS) . The N CTSN CDS collected informa - tion between 2004 and 2016 from over 14,000 youth referred for treatment with histories of PTEs . 4 7% of youth reported exposure to four or more PTEs . The m ost common diagnoses or clini - cal problems (in descending order) were PTSD, General Behavioral Problems, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder . O ver 60% of youth presented with behavior problems and over 50% experienced aca - demic problems, demonstrating the wide range of issues associated with childhood PTEs . B oth the NCTSN CDS and the National Comorbidity Study demon - strated a positive correlation between the number of PTEs and the number of comorbid diagnoses . I n the NCTSN CDS, 93% of the sample was exposed before eight years of age with 50% demonstrat - ing impairment in multiple areas, such as affect regulation, attention, and concen - tration, by age 11 . Dr . Am aya-Jackson and colleagues used data from the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study and the National Comorbidity Study to demon-strate that certain combinations of ACEs confer a greater effect than the sum of their individual effects . F or example, for females, the single most potent ACE is sexual abuse . W hen combined with domestic violence, the risk of develop-ing psychopathology increases more than the individual risks of the two ACEs combined . F or males, poverty is the most potent ACE and a multi-plicative effect exists when combined with parental substance abuse . D r . A maya-Jackson concluded that child - hood trauma is probably the single most predictable (and preventable) contributor to mental illness . Br ooks R. Keeshin, MD , presented Pediatric Trauma: Practical Approaches to the Assessment of Experiences and Symptoms in which he described a protocol, The Process Care Model (CPM), to assess for traumatic experi-ences and traumatic stress symptoms . C PM is a proposed treatment algorithm for pediatric ambulatory care practices . D r . K eeshin is an assistant professor in the Division of Child Protection and Family Health at the University of Utah and Safe and Healthy Families . H e is both a child abuse pediatrician and a CAP . W hile specifically designed for pediatrics, his model is clearly appli-cable to child and adolescent psychiatry . Dr . Keeshin described the rationale for targeting childhood traumatic stress by comparing risk of medical illness due to toxins versus the risk of develop-ing psychiatric illnesses after traumatic experiences . Fo r example, tobacco smokers have an 8% chance of develop-ing lung cancer . I n comparison, youth exposed to four or more ACEs have a 50% chance of developing depression, while those exposed to a single poten-tially traumatic event have a 5-30% chance of developing PTSD . M oreover, traumatic stress is co-morbid with many psychiatric disorders . CP M is a decision support tool that helps providers follow standard/best practice . T he overall \"road map\" begins with the identification of a PTE either in the past or recent . I f positive, the Assessment for Safety, Symptoms, and Protective Factors is conducted in three steps: 1) an assessment of whether a referral to child protective services is necessary, 2) a sui-cidality assessment using the PHQ-9 as the initial screener, 3) a treatment deci-sion tree of trauma specific therapies . Steven Berkowitz, MD, and Lisa Amaya-Jackson, MD, provided a number of clini- cal samples to demonstrate the utility of the CPM and how it provides an expedi-ent protocol for providers, including algorithms for prescribing medications . D r . K eeshin addressed the importance of identifying and treating trauma related sleep disturbances as they may be a key contributor to poor functioning . T he pre- sentation ended with an initial finding of trauma screening in a general pediat-ric outpatient clinic and a child abuse clinic that illustrated the commonality of trauma related issues; 25% of youth in the primary care clinic and 100% in the child abuse clinic had at least one previous PTE . I n these two groups, 10% vs . 4 6% had suicidal ideation and 22% vs . 4 6% had significant traumatic stress symptoms, respectively . St even Berkowitz, MD , presented Naming Names: Incorporating Childhood Trauma and Adversity Into Practice . H e reviewed the complexity and poor specificity of nomenclature regarding trauma and stressor related disorders and presented research that demonstrated the correlation of early life stress (as illustrated by low socio-economic status) in the development of childhood disorders such as ADHD, depression, anxiety, and disruptive behaviors . N euroimaging work of Martin Teicher, MD, PhD, and colleagues demonstrates the wide range of neu-rodevelopmental and brain changes associated with child maltreatment, including findings involving the hip - pocampus, anterior cingulate F urthermore, maltreatment impacts key fiber tracts as the corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, and cin - gulum bundle . I nterestingly, the presence or absence of maltreatment in individu-als with the same diagnoses predicts different structural brain alterations . S ince single incident and chronic expo- sures may impact brain functioning, an injury model may be the best explana-tory approach for understanding trauma and stressor related disorders . I t is consistent with the findings that chronic stress causes or contributes to multiple disorders and also with the observa-tions that symptoms are often transitory and diminish over time, similar to many physical injuries . D r . B erkowitz offered a definition of trauma that attempts to be consistent with the research: Trauma is the deleterious change in function caused by an experience/experiences . Vi ctor G. Carrion, MD , provided a dis- cussion in which he described the large number of effective psychotherapies for traumatized youth now available and the importance of traumatic reminders or cues in understanding behaviors and symptoms seen in traumatized youth . G iven that treatment is effective, it is imperative that symptomatic children are evaluated for histories of trauma and stress . H e provided a number of clinical examples to demonstrate how frequently child psychiatric patients have been exposed to stressful and traumatic expe-riences and how this knowledge should influence practice . In s ummary, this Clinical Perspectives demonstrated that traumatized children present with a wide variety of symp-toms and psychiatric disorders and that traumatized children represent a major-ity of patients seen by mental health professionals . I ncorporating a trauma- informed approach to assessment and treatment should improve outcomes and decrease untoward medication effects . A b arrier to optimizing our assessment and treatments is the complicated trauma nomenclature . A n injury model of psy- chological trauma may abrogate these difficulties . m References 1 .

The m any issues raised by the increas- ing access to medical marijuana among children and adolescents was the focus of the Clinical Perspective, Medical Marijuana: A Potpourri of the Evidence Base, Clinical, Neurodevelopmental, Legal, Ethical, and Research Issues . T he forum was a collaboration among the following AACAP committees: Complementary & Integrative Medicine, Ethics, Psychopharmacology, and Substance Use . Ga il A. Edelsohn, MD, MSPH , from Community Care Behavioral Health Organization, chaired the Clinical Perspectives, and presented the histori-cal perspective on the legal and ethical status of marijuana . T he early history of marijuana includes the era of prohibition in the 1930s, when the Federal Bureau of Narcotics condemned it as leading to \"homicidal mania\" and the Treasury Department levied prohibitive taxes . I n 1970, marijuana was classified as a Schedule I drug, which prohibited use for any purpose . S ince then, the passing of more permissive state laws have led to increasing tension with the restrictive federal laws . Wi thin this legal land- scape, there may be professional risks for physicians recommending marijuana . T he ethical principles that inform clinical guidelines include establishing a patient-physician relationship, completing a thorough patient evaluation, balancing the principles of beneficence and malefi-cence, promoting informed and shared decision-making, maintaining fidelity, protecting confidentiality, and ensuring informed consent and assent .Ti mothy E. Wilens, MD , from Massachusetts General Hospital, sum-marized the evidence base for medical marijuana . H e highlighted chemother- apy-induced nausea and vomiting and treatment-refractory epilepsy as the two major conditions for which there is research support . S tudies for seizures used cannabidiol (CBD) up to 50 mg/kg/day, with sedation as the most common adverse event . S tudies targeting chemo- therapy-induced nausea and vomiting used tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), with typical doses ranging from 0 .5 mg t o 2 .5 mg s cheduled or as needed every 6-12 hours . B ased on a systematic review published in Pediatrics ,1 there currently remains very limited, and overall insufficient, evidence to sup-port the use of medical marijuana for pediatric psychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder, Tourette disorder, and psychiatric symptoms of Fragile X . D ifferent constituents of marijuana, specifically THC and CBD, were highlighted as chemicals with distinct psychopharmacological action and potential therapeutic benefit . F inally, the process for which medical marijuana can be certified in different states was discussed . T hese processes typically involve the child's doctor, a legal guardian, and occasionally another independent physician . De borah R. Simkin, MD , from Emory University School of Medicine, reviewed the effects of marijuana on neurodevel-opment . R esearch has shown pre-natal exposure to marijuana can negatively impact brain structure, cognition, and learning . P ost-natal stressors may further precipitate cognitive and emotional dif-ficulties, partly due to increased stress sensitivity . R isk of experimentation during adolescence is increased due to a relatively underdeveloped prefrontal cortex . M arijuana use during this criti- cal period may increase risk of opiate abuse . F inally, adolescent marijuana use has been associated with increased risk of depression, anxiety, and psycho-sis . P otential mechanisms may involve marijuana altering brain connectiv-ity, as the endocannabinoid system is integral to the pruning and myelina-tion processes that underlie adolescent brain development . Ke vin M. Gray, MD , from the Medical University of South Carolina, recom-mended embracing the complexity of the topic in discussing medical marijuana with patients and families . C linically, marijuana can be both a safe medicine and a harmful and risky drug . M any factors influence the bal- ance of benefit and risk of marijuana, including patient factors such as age, genetics, and environment, as well as the type of marijuana . T here are many distinct dose-dependent effects of over 80 unique cannabinoids in marijuana . One important clinical consideration is the lack of standardization of marijuana preparations from dispensaries, lead-ing to variations in dose, potency, and chemical constituency . F urthermore, labeling is often inaccurate . R isks dem- onstrated by current research range from acute intoxication such as impaired driv-ing and decision-making, to risks from chronic repeated use such as addiction, worsening course of psychiatric illness, negative impact of emotion and cogni-tive development, and poor academic achievement . C linical discussions of medical marijuana should include the evidence of therapeutic efficacy, safety concerns, and alternatives that may have a more favorable efficacy and safety profile . D iscussions of marijuana policy changes are also complicated, as options extend beyond prohibition or legalization, and decriminalization, medicalization, and commercializa - tion . E ngaging in an open dialogue with families is critical to maintaining rapport when addressing a polarized and challenging topic . Shane Shucheng Wong, MD, and Timothy E. Wilens, Y/FEBRUARY 2019 37 AACAP'S 65TH ANNUAL MEETNG RECAPAlbert J. Allen, MD, PhD , from Eli Lilly, presented the complicated regulatory issues involved in research in children and adolescents . H e reviewed the Federal Drug Administration programs relevant to pediatric medical marijuana research, including the Investigational New Drug application, the Pediatric Research Equity Act provisions, and the Botanical Drug Development guidance for drug labelling . A dditionally, there are specific FDA regulations relevant to pediatric research, including the principle of scientific necessity and the prospect of direct benefit (PDB) con-cept . A s ignificant barrier to research is marijuana's classification as a sched-ule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act, which is overseen by the U .S . D epartment of Justice's Drug Enforcement Agency . D ue to the federal regulations that can be enforced by the Department of Justice, there are potential risks for subjects and investigators enrolled in medical marijuana clinical trials which can be mitigated by Certificates of Confidentiality . F ederal banking laws also prohibit involvement with mari-juana, limiting sources of sponsorship for clinical trials . Fi nally, Catherine A. Martin, MD , from the University of Kentucky College of Medicine, as the discussant, summarized the presentations . S he shared a clini- cal case that illustrated the complexity and challenges of addressing adolescent marijuana use, especially in the context of a shifting legislative policy landscape and limited scientific research . mReference 1 .

More Annual Meeting Photos 38 AACAP MEETNG RECAP AACAP'S 65TH ANNUAL MEETNG RECAPCoordinated Specialty Care for First Episode Psychosis Approximately 115,000 young people annually develop a psychotic illness in the United States . D espite significant research and clinical efforts, affected individu-als often suffer substantial long-term morbidity and impairment . T o address this important public health need, there has been an increase in the develop-ment and implementation of coordi-nated specialty care programs, modeled after the National Institute of Mental Health initiative Recovery After An Initial Schizophrenia Episode - Early Treatment Program (NAVIGATE) . At t his year's AACAP Annual Meeting, the symposium Coordinated Specialty Care for First Episode Psychosis addressed various components and outcomes of coordinated specialty care programs for first-episode psychosis . Ma ria Monroe-DeVita, PhD, an asso- ciate professor at the University of Washington, reviewed the implementa-tion of Washington State's coordinated specialty care program for first episode psychosis, named New Journeys . D r . M onroe-DeVita highlighted that the New Journeys treatment model was based on a combination of approaches developed by the Early Assessment and Support Alliance (EASA) and NAVIGATE . T o date, New Journeys, funded through a mental health block grant, has been imple-mented in five community mental health agencies throughout Washington State . A d iverse array of clients receive services from New Journeys, including a large (43%) Hispanic population . A t the begin- ning of the six-month evaluation period, almost half of participants reported moderate or higher levels of depression and anxiety . A fter six months of treat- ment, there were significant reductions in psychotic symptoms, depression, and anxiety among clients . N o reductions in substance use were observed . D r . M onroe-DeVita concluded by highlight - ing additional areas of clinical need that the University of Washington's develop-ing first-episode psychosis program will address, including addressing substance use disorders and incorporating whole person care, centralized screenings, and mHealth (medical and public health ser-vices supported by mobile phones and other wireless technology) . Ol adunni Oluwoye, PhD, CHES, a research assistant professor at Washington State University, addressed the issues of racial and ethnic dispar-ties in treatment outcomes for those experiencing first-episode psychosis . U sing data from the RAISE-ETP, a large randomized trial that assessed the effec-tiveness of NAVIGATE, Dr . O luwoye examined whether there were racial and ethnic differences in psychiatric symp - toms and service utilization in those receiving treatment as usual, versus the coordinated specialty care provided by NAVIGATE . W hen compared to non- Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks and other minorities receiving routine treatment in community settings had significantly higher psychiatric symptoms and lower rates of service utilization . I n the NAVIGATE group, there were no ethnic or racial differences in psychiatric symptoms . T he only disparity in service utilization was that families of non-Hispanic black participants were less likely than non-Hispanic white families to receive family psychoeducation . C oordinated specialty care programs such as NAVIGATE appear to reduce racial and ethnic disparities found in usual community mental health care . D r . O luwoye highlighted the importance of including family members, particularly racial and ethnic minorities, in treatment planning . W hen treating first-episode psychosis, family involvement and psychoeducation are associated with improved outcomes . Dr . O luwoye also discussed a secondary data analysis that she and her colleagues conducted using data from the RAISE-ETP study regarding substance use . T he study examined the impact of tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis use on treatment outcomes . T he overall data found that at intake, roughly 50% of participants reported recent tobacco use and up to 30% reported alcohol or cannabis use . P articipants reporting alcohol use at intake were more likely to not adhere to medication regimens . C annabis users had higher levels of illness severity dur-ing treatment compared to non-users . P atients using tobacco had higher levels of illness severity, a higher number of missed pills, higher ratings of psychiatric symptoms, and lower quality of life dur-ing treatment relative to non-smokers . T hus, although much of the research has focused on cannabis use, tobacco smoking was associated with more nega - tive clinical outcomes than the other two substances . O f course, individuals using one substance often use another, so these findings overlap . T he development of effective treatments for substance abuse remains a vital clinical need . Kr ystal Ozanick, MD , a child psychia - trist at Kaiser Permanente (formerly at Seattle Children's Hospital), discussed her experience in developing an outpatient clinic for adolescents with first-episode psychosis . S he described in detail individual resiliency train-ing (IRT), one of the major pillars of the NAVIGATE model . I RT promotes wellness and recovery by identifying client strength and resiliency factors, improving illness self-management, and teaching skills to enhance functional recovery . I RT has seven standard mod- ules, plus additional modules that can be taught based on the client's needs . F or Dr . O zanick, the NAVIGATE IRT training provided the necessary skills and knowledge to use IRT with clients . Oladunni Oluwoye, PhD, CHES, and Jon M. 2019 39 AACAP'S 65TH ANNUAL MEETNG RECAPShe also addressed challenges in the implementation of a clinic specializing in first-episode psychosis, including coverage issues related to other clini-cal demands and the need for multiple team members to fulfill all the roles of the NAVIGATE treatment model . D r . O zanick left AACAP members with some advice . E ven if your organiza- tion does not have the capacity to fully implement the NAVIGATE model, using IRT, including the patient handouts/worksheets that are free and available online, greatly enhances the treatment of youth with first-episode psychosis . Jo n M. McClellan, MD , professor at the University of Washington, provided an overview of coordinated specialty care, highlighting points from each presenta - tion . P er the World Health Organization, schizophrenia affects approximately 23 million people worldwide, and con - fers a substantial amount of social and illness burden . T he lifespan of affected individuals is cut short on average by approximately two decades, given the high rate of comorbid medical prob - lems, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and suicide . U nfortunately, the efficacy of medication treatments has not advanced much in the past several decades . I ndividuals often go months before the illness is recognized, and lon - ger durations of untreated psychosis are associated with worse outcomes . T hus, the goal of first-episode psychosis pro - grams is to promote early identification and effective comprehensive treatment . Co llectively, coordinated specialty care programs all involve multidisciplinary teams that provide evidence-based pharmacology, individual and family-based educational and psychotherapeutic services, occupational and educational supports, and assertive community out - reach and case management . Re search assessing the effectiveness of these programs demonstrates improvements in clinical symptoms, functional outcomes, treatment adherence, and rates of hos - pitalization . T he next hurdle is the wide dissemination of these models of treat - ment across communities and states, such that all affected individuals have access to high quality coordinated care . m Dr. Oluwoye is a research assistant professor in the Initiative for Research and Education to Advance Community Health, Elson S.

More Annual Meeting MEETNG RECAPViolent Video Exposure and Its Impact on Youth of Color If you have never played one of the popular violent video games, it is hard to understand the embedded levels of violence, racism, and misogyny . Y outh, particularly youth of color, are increasingly interacting with video games . T his Clinical Perspectives, a joint presentation by the Diversity and Culture Committee and the Media Committee, had three objectives: 1) examine associa-tions between youth's race/ethnicity and their violent video game playing habits; 2) highlight the data from some of the larger and more recent national surveys, paying particular attention to the gaming patterns of adolescents; and 3) provide recommendations to child and adoles-cent psychiatrists about how to educate patients and their parents about violent video games and their impact on youth . As C hair, Wanjiku Njoroge, MD , of the University of Pennsylvania, shared data from a Commonsense Media survey of viewing practices . T weens (ages 8-12 years) endorsed playing video games 52% of the time, and teens (13-18 years) endorsed playing video games 42% of the time . O verall, 12% of tweens and 17 % of teens reported spending over two hours every day interacting with video games . T he data reflected that 68% of video games involved some depiction of violence . R esearch has shown that in some of the most popular games there are 2 .3 vi olent interactions per every minute of play! Lee Carlisle, MD , of the University of Washington, presented data reflecting the ubiquity of racial and stereotypic portrayals of characters in violent video games . W hite protagonists remain over-represented in popular video games, whereas Latinx and African-American characters are simultaneously underrepresented and typically cast in a stereotypical manner . D r . C arlisle shared data indicating that violent video games have a discernable negative effect on youth of color secondary to rampant racism and sexism, and on non-Hispanic white players using avatars of color . Pa ul Weigle, MD , of Hartford Healthcare, reviewed both positive and negative impacts of gaming habits on youth . H e noted that 61% of children and adolescents age 8-18 years are play-ing video games on any given day, for an average of two hours and 13 minutes . H e cited a relative overuse of gaming by African American boys, who play more video games than their peers . D r . W eigle highlighted that violent video game play is increasingly commonplace among youth, as game ratings are typically unheeded . H e reviewed the data around the potential harms of increased playing of violent games, including increased aggressive thoughts . D r . W eigle ended his presentation by encouraging provid-ers to educate youth and their families about the risks of excessive gaming and violent game exposure . Ma wuena Agbonyitor, MD, MSC , of Mercy Care in Atlanta, GA, focused on the intersection of race and gender in video game culture, highlighting the diversity of the gaming community . S he discussed the lack of diversity of characters in lead roles and that present diverse characters often display racial stereotypes . F emale characters are often overly sexualized . D r . A gbonyitor shared data showing exposure to such games can promote formation of prejudices and reinforce gendered behaviors amongst video game players in real life . S he also discussed the harassment experienced by female gamers, as well as racialized hate speech experienced by gamers of color while playing with others . S he highlighted how some gamers have created safe spaces targeted towards women and girls of color to play video games with less fear of facing prejudiced behaviors from other players . As d iscussant, Nicholas Carson, MD , of Harvard Medical School, began by discussing the immense popularity of the video game industry, noting its cur-rent worth at $130 billion . D r . C arson detailed the data from Commonsense Media's national survey, \"Social Media, Social Life,\" showing that youth expo-sure to hate speech in media has increased from 2012 to 2016 . H e sug- gested that gaming has \"captured the hearts and minds of our patients,\" noting the important role for mental health professionals to attend more closely to the gaming habits of patients . H e further suggested that online video gaming forums that allow player anonymity can be an important source of racist, sexist, homophobic, and anti-religious troll-ing . D r . C arson highlighted innovative strategies that are being used to enhance prosocial attitudes in gaming . T he most effective efforts occurred when positive messages were presented subtly during a meaningful, immersive gaming experi-ence . D r . C arson ended the panel by highlighting that the number of hours per week youth spend playing video games, and the meanings that patients ascribe Wanjiku Njoroge, MD, Lee Carlisle, MD, Paul Weigle, MD, MD, MSC, 41 AACAP'S 65TH ANNUAL MEETNG RECAPto these games, are public health and clinical concerns . The pa nelists recommended that child and adolescent psychiatrists should be vigilant to not only time patients spent with video games, but also to the types of games and the impacts these games may have on development . T hey outlined concrete guidelines and resources to assist child and adoles-cent psychiatrists in understanding the gaming culture . Wh ile the panelists highlighted with concern the amount of time youth spend interacting with violent video games, they also shared the literature reflect-ing benefits from prosocial gaming . T he presenters noted that video game developers are diversifying their field to combat the racism, violence, and misog-yny currently seen in many of the most popular games . F urther, adolescents are responding to the bullying and misogyny by banding together to play with one another in \"safe spaces .\" By t he end of the session, participants gained the tools needed to be able to discuss violent video games with their adolescent patients, to recognize when gaming may be negatively impacting teens, and to provide options for prosocial games with positive messages . m Dr. Njoroge is an assistant professor of psychiatry at University of Pennsylvania and is the program director for the child and adolescent psychiatry fellowship at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP).

More Annual Meeting Photos 42 AACAP Making Effective Change in This Unpredictable World: A Panel Discussion With Elected Officials If the recent midterm election voter turnout is a measure of political engagement, then our country is more engaged than it has been for the last 50 years . A s the Annual Meeting was held just two weeks prior to this election, the timing could not have been better for a Member Services Forum focused on political advocacy . Making Effective Change in This Unpredictable World: A Panel Discussion With Elected Officials featured a discussion with three legislators from the Washington State House of Representatives along with the only known AACAP member currently holding a publicly elected office . M embers learned directly from this bipartisan and nonpartisan group of elected officials about how to speak to officials to be better advocates; how state and local governments work and the most opportune times for input into the policy-making process; how our expertise as child and adolescent psychiatrists is valuable to effect positive change; how to identify avenues for increased influence in policy that affect ourselves and our patients, includ-ing running for office ourselves; and much more . The p resenters began with introduc- tions into their backgrounds, why they ran for elected office, and how they impact children's mental health policy . A vanti Bergquist, MD, MS , from Eating Recovery Center and Seattle Children's Hospital, works full-time as a child and adolescent psychiatrist while also being an elected member of the Renton School District Board Avanti Berquist, MD, MSof Directors . S he is married to another presenter, Steve Bergquist, who was elected to the Washington State House of Representatives in 2012 . R epresentative Bergquist was recently honored with the inaugural Washington State Psychiatric Association Legislator of the Year award for his efforts to improve the state's climate for mental and physical health care . T ana Senn and Tom Dent, mem- bers of the Washington State House of Representatives since 2013 and 2015 respectively, also participated . R epresentatives Senn and Dent have worked tirelessly to improve Washington State policies to increase access to, and the quality of, children's mental health care in the state . F or their efforts, they each received the 2017 National Child Health Advocate Award from the American Academy of Pediatrics . The pa nel explored the experience of the audience in child advocacy . T he attendees spanned the spectrum, from novice to seasoned political advocates . A ll attendees agreed that they frequently advocate for their patients, and many, but not all, had experience in directly contacting elected officials . A s urpris- ingly large number had traveled to Washington, DC, to advocate, perhaps indicating the success of AACAP's Legislative Conference . M any had also been to their state capitols to advocate . A m ajority of attendees indicated that they knew that officials want to hear from their constituents, but a majority also wondered if their advocacy efforts made a difference . T he presenters used these audience participation questions to advise attendees how to further develop their advocacy skills . T hey described how they as elected officials experience the advocacy efforts of their constitu-ents . S ome of the helpful tips that were shared included: 1 . De veloping a working relationship with officials is the most important foundation for advocacy efforts . T hey are much more likely to want to help you with a specific legislative \"ask\" if they already know you and trust your judgment . 2 . To d evelop a relationship, meet with them in the off-session without a specific ask . I nvite them to your clinic to see how you are helping their constituents . A sk them for coffee to discuss your interests and offer yourself as a resource for information about children's mental health in the future . 3 . Re member that they ran for office to make a positive difference in their communities . C ompliments and expressing your appreciation goes a long way . S end them a thank you note after the meeting and follow up to keep your message on their minds . 4 . Le arn about them beforehand to bet- ter craft your message . F or instance, Representative Dent was a foster and then adopted parent to a son with significant mental health difficul-ties, which influences his desire to help other young people with similar struggles . R epresentative Senn shared how her children's school staff used social and emotional learning skills to support her children when there were a series of deaths in the family . 5 . El ected officials want to meet with their constituents, and also will meet with you if you do not live in their district but are caring for their constituents in your practice . F or example, there are many counties in Washington State without a child and adolescent psychiatrist . I t would be even more impactful to bring a child and family that are their constituents . 6 . The y prefer in-person meetings or phone calls, but if you send a form email, be sure to change the subject and the first two lines . O therwise it gets batched with all of the other emails that are the same, and they are unlikely to read it specifically . 7 . Dr . B ergquist advised that more local government positions such as school board may be different, but for the legislators, meeting with constituents JANUAR Y/FEBRUARY 2019 43 AACAP'S . R epresentative Senn stated that if a legislator will not meet with you as a constituent, \"run against them!\" Dr . a nd Representative Bergquist went on to describe their entry into politi-cal life as a potential road map for our members or other friends of medicine to consider a run for office . S ome of their advice: 1 . It w as incredibly valuable to attend the AMA PAC's candidate training school which focused specifically on teaching physicians and friends of medicine to run for office . T hey learned that running for office takes a strong commitment not just from the candidate, but also from their family and community . T here are also multiple other candidate training programs that could be helpful . 2 . Re presentative Bergquist utilized his deep roots in their community to gather support and win an election with far less funds than his opponents (one opponent raised six times as much money) . H e made personal connections with voters by knocking on 12,000 doors himself (and losing about 30 lbs . t hat he really could not afford to lose), plus an additional 8,000 doors visited by his supporters . 3 . Dr . B ergquist saw the positive effects Representative Bergquist and his colleagues made in office and was inspired to get more involved in policy-making . S he started with com- mittees and boards that influenced mental health care improvements, and organically made connections that led to more and more opportu-nity to effect positive change . 4 . Se eing these positive changes resolved any burnout issues Dr . B ergquist was experiencing, and she emphasized that when we talk about solving physician burnout, we should always include the positive impact of successful advocacy efforts . 5 . The or ganic connections and positive policy changes led Dr . B ergquist to run for office herself on the school board in her hometown . S he was already active in the community and had shown the value of her interest in children's issues, which likely contrib - uted to no one running against her . 6 . The B ergquists encourage AACAP members to contact them if they are interested in running for office . At tendees had the opportunity to ask questions and interact with the present-ers . I t was a lively and engaged group, and the presenters expressed their gratitude for being asked to share their experiences . m Dr. Bergquist is a child, adolescent, and adult psychiatrist at Eating Recovery Center in Bellevue, WA, and Seattle Children's Hospital in Seattle.

More Annual Meeting Photos 44 AACAP MEETNG RECAP AACAP'S Child Psychiatry and Health: Neuroscience, Transgenerational Effects, and Social Factors Douglas A. Kramer, MD, MS , chair of the Symposium, Biological Roots of Child Psychiatry and Health: Neuroscience, Transgenerational Effects , and Social Factors, posed the question, \"If we were asked to invent psychiatry today, knowing what we now know, what would be the minimal unit of research, prevention, and treatment?\" This provocation framed the research and recommendations of all four pre-senters at the symposium . E choing David A. Brent, MD 's advocacy at the Karl Menninger, MD, Plenary, the present-ers offered their emerging research while also encouraging implementa-tion of interventions incorporating what we have learned . L ike Dr . B rent, their research findings direct child and adoles - cent psychiatry to act more systemically and upstream . I n this Biological Roots symposium, the roots revealed them-selves to be interdependent diverse systems that cannot be adequately understood with reductionist inquiry . St acy Drury, MD, PhD , is engaged in the tangled work of specifying biological markers of the impact of social determi-nants of health during the initial stages of child development . S he discussed evidence from The Infant Development Study that placental telomere length may be both a marker for cumulative stress as well as a predictor of disease . H igh maternal Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are highly associated with shortened telomeres in placental villi cells, suggesting an impact of pre-existing maternal allostatic load on fetal cells . T hus, the work of Dr . D rury and colleagues is mapping out the avenues by which social determinants begin to impact the development and health of children as early as prenatally . Dr . D rury and colleagues also link these biological models of allostatic load to clinically relevant behavioral and emotional systems .1 They found sex dif- ferences to cumulative maternal stress in infant stress response system reactivity . A t four months of age, infants of mothers with high prenatal stress had alterations in sympathetic tone compared to infants of mothers with low prenatal stress . G irls of mothers with high prenatal stress had less recovery of sympathetic tone than girls of mothers with low prenatal stress, whereas boys of mothers with high prenatal stress had higher baseline sym-pathetic tone, and no relative reactivity . T his suggests very early establishment of sex differences in infant stress response associated with maternal prenatal stress . Dr . D rury asserted, \"Boys and girls are forever different .\" Fu rthering the links between biologic markers, pathophysiology, and oppor-tunities for directed interventions, accelerated telomere loss in toddlers enhanced the association between maternal ACE score and external-izing behaviors at 18 months of age . D r . D rury is developing a model of the development of the child stress response system across developmental time periods linked with the influence of maternal early life and perinatal experiences, as well as the child's relational environment, and ultimately related to both premature telomere aging with its resultant socio-emotional and physical impacts . Ry an Herringa, MD, PhD , envisages a time when treatments might be tailored to their impact on individual neurocir-cuitry rather than on symptom clusters . H e discussed data from his longitudinal study of brain development of youth with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), compared to youth without psychiatric symptoms . Dr . Herr inga and colleagues found decreased resting-state coupling between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and both the amyg-dala and the hippocampus, as well as between the dorsolateral prefrontal cor-tex and the hippocampus, in youth with PTSD in comparison to youth without psychiatric symptoms .2 This decrease in coupling occurs despite reductions in symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression, suggesting that symptom improvement does not always correlate with expected neurological findings . T hey also found sustained reductions in prefrontal cortex grey matter, over time, among youth with PTSD . H e raises questions about the eventual possibility of determining which brain networks are predictive of recovery from, versus persistence of, PTSD symptoms . Wi th such information, theoretically, therapies can be tailored to strengthening the recovery-associated networks . Dy lan G . G ee, PhD, provided an example of how relational interac-tion can influence the development of endogenous anxiety regulatory mecha-nisms . S he described a normative switch from childhood to adolescence involving Margaret S. Cary, MD, MPH, and Douglas A. Kramer, MD, MS \"In this Biological Roots symposium, the roots revealed themselves to be interdependent diverse systems that cannot be adequately understood with reductionist inquiry.\" JANUAR Y/FEBRUARY reactivity to a fear stimulus . C hildren primarily rely upon a caregiver's presence to facili-tate regulation of their fear reaction . B y adolescence, fronto-amygdala con - nectivity is mature and allows greater internal fear regulation .3 However, young children who have experienced parental deprivation during their first three years of life, e .g ., be ing raised in an orphan- age, tend to not absorb biologically the reassurance of external caregivers when afraid, even after an extended period of time with a stable adoptive family . S imilar to the work of Dr . D rury, Dr . G ee is mapping out mechanisms of how life experience can impact developmental trajectories . In summary, an insuffi - cient amount of relationship-mediated regulation during the early developmen-tal period, or excessive reliance upon relationship-mediated regulation during the period of fronto-amygdala matura-tion in a child with separation anxiety, can result in persistent separation anxi-ety, and disruptions to the maturation of fronto-amygdala coupling . Joh n P . C apitanio, PhD, began by stating, \"Our sociality is embedded in our biol-ogy in a fundamental way .\" In f act, there is extensive sympathetic nervous system innervation of the lymphatic system . H e and colleagues at the California National Primate Research Center found that among rhesus monkeys inoculated with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), those living in unstable social groups had a much shorter duration of survival than those living in stable social groups .4 Socially stressed monkeys showed increases in the density of catechol-aminergic varicosities in their lymph nodes . S IV replicates preferentially in proximity to such varicosities . T hese animals also manifested blunted anti-body production compared to socially unstressed individuals . Dr . C apitanio and colleagues also studied the underlying biology of loneli-ness in humans and rhesus monkeys . L oneliness is associated with reduced glucocorticoid receptor functional activity, upregulation of proinflamma-tory genes, downregulation of interferon (viral) responses, and downregulation of antibody responses . S eparation from our social connection disrupts our biology as it disrupts our emotional experience . I n a concluding statement, he said, \"The idea of interactions, and particularly the dynamics involved in systems-type thinking, is being considered more these days . . . r eductionism has value, but it will never explain more than a piece of reality, since reality is mostly a set of embedded systems at all levels, ranging from the molecular to the planetary .\" In his summary, James J. Hudziak, MD, the discussant, encouraged us to broaden our conception of treatment beyond medication and traditional psychotherapy . H e described the benefit of mindfulness and meditation on both maintaining telomere length as well as regulating glucocorticoid and sympa-thetic nervous system mediated stress responses . H e identified the findings of aerobic exercise promoting hippocampal volume . F inally, he outlined the impact of family-focused psychiatry on support-ing health-promoting relationships .5 This symposium followed the call to action by Dr . B rent during his plenary address, for child and adolescent psy-chiatrists to: 1) provide family-focused psychiatry in the context of collab-orative care in primary care clinics, 2) strengthen basic well-being, and 3) engage in prevention efforts . A ll of the speakers in the Biological Roots of Child Psychiatry symposium advocated for the importance of reinforcing attuned, responsive relationships between care-givers and children . T hus, while there is no such thing as a baby, there is also no such thing as a child . O ur social nature and our biology require family and relationally oriented psychiatry as both treatment and nourishment of the roots of child psychological development .6 m References 1 .

W hen applied repeatedly, it can also be used as an intervention for condi-tions such as depression and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) . W hile TMS has been studied extensively in adults, research in children and adolescents is more nascent . T his symposium brought together researchers from four different institutions in North America to present cutting-edge data on the application of TMS in pediatric populations, both as a technique to reveal new information about brain functioning in the context of pediatric depression and ASD, and to share new results of clinical trials using TMS as a treatment for these disorders in young people . Fi rst, Paul E. Croarkin, DO, MS , pro- vided an overview of TMS applications as a neurophysiological probe and a therapeutic intervention for psychiat-ric disorders . H e reviewed safety data from pediatric TMS studies to date, and explained the different types of stimulation protocols that are currently available for these applications . D r . C roarkin reviewed past pioneering work conducted by himself and others at the Mayo Clinic in repetitive TMS for the treatment of depression in adolescents . A r ecent re-analysis of these studies sug- gested that TMS treatment was capable of reducing suicidal ideation in youth . H e also reviewed promising findings utilizing TMS and magnetic resonance scanning technology to identify bio-markers of suicidality in adolescents . D r . C roarkin discussed the promise of recent innovations in TMS methodol-ogy, including theta-burst stimulation, which may be capable of achieving similar efficacy in depression treatment with shorter protocols, and synchro-nized TMS, which delivers lower-energy stimulation that is tailored to the patient's own brain oscillations . F inally, Dr . C roarkin presented the design of a multi- site, sham-controlled study funded by NeuroStar that was designed in pursuit of FDA approval for repetitive TMS as a treatment for adolescent depression . T he study has completed enrollment, and the data are currently under analysis . Se cond, Kathryn R. Cullen, MD , presented her results on a small trial of \"deep\" TMS in adolescents with depres-sion using the H1 butterfly TMS coil, the H1 coil was designed to achieve deeper brain penetration . T his has appeal for the treatment of depression which involves limbic brain structures located deep in the brain . D r . C ullen shared her origi- nal study protocol, a sham-controlled clinical trial that applied the same TMS parameters FDA-approved for the deep TMS device in the treatment of depres-sion in adults (including a stimulation intensity 120% of motor threshold, stim-ulation frequency 18 hertz) . H owever, as she reported in 2016, the first adolescent in the protocol had a grand-mal seizure following the first active treatment given at the target stimulation intensity of 120% of motor threshold . D r . C ullen reviewed changes made to the ado-lescent deep TMS protocol in order to enhance safety (decreasing both stimula-tion intensity [80% of motor threshold for three subjects and then 100% of motor threshold for another three sub-jects] and stimulation frequency to 10 hertz) . S he described clinical and safety observations from six adolescents who have undergone deep TMS treatment with the revised protocol . W hile no significant adverse events have occurred, the response rate has been low (one out of six) . N ext steps include increasing the stimulation intensity back to 120% of motor threshold while keeping the frequency at 10 hertz . Thir d, Stephanie Hope Ameis, MD , presented her work on the use of TMS to improve cognitive functioning in adolescents with ASD . S he commented on the heterogeneity of ASD as a barrier to developing innovative treatments . S he also noted that higher executive functioning is a predictor of greater response to interventions, and presented an argument for targeting executive functioning with TMS . I n her study of 42 young adults with ASD who were randomized to four weeks of repetitive TMS or sham, the rate of adverse effects was equal across groups . B oth TMS and sham were well tolerated . B oth groups showed significant improvements in executive functioning after the inter-vention, with no significant differences between groups . H owever, a post-hoc analysis revealed that a subgroup of patients defined by low adaptive scores on the Vineland II assessment showed a significant treatment effect . A ctive TMS was associated with improvement in performance compared to sham in those with low adaptive functioning . T his group difference was not found in those with high adaptive scores . Fou rth, Ernesto Pedapati, MD, MS , discussed the clinical overlap between ASD and ADHD, and presented his Rana Emaghraby, MD, and Kathryn R. AACAP'S 65TH using TMS as a probe to under- stand brain function in these populations and to differentiate the clinical groups . D r . P edapati reviewed the dramatically increased prevalence of ASD in the last decade, and pointed out that comorbid ADHD is quite common in the ASD population . T his comorbidity is a major challenge for treatment optimization . D r . P edapati reviewed his prior research showing reduced intracortical excit-ability in youth with ASD compared to controls . H e also noted significant variability in the results, which moti-vated a subsequent study of 49 people with ASD: 20 patients without comorbid ADHD (ASD-) and 20 patients comorbid ADHD e found that ASD+ had intracortical facilitation (ICF) than both ASD- and controls . I CF was associated with executive function and inattention in ASD . D r . P edapati offered that changes in may sug-gest aberrant subcortical contributions to ASD+ patients . H is future work will examine the impact of methylphenidate treatment on ICF in ASD+ and ASD- .Fi nally, as the discussant, Graham J. Emslie, MD , provided a synthesis of the presentations and led a discussion with the audience and panel . H e reviewed findings from the STAR*D study and TORDIA, highlighting the need for new treatments of adolescent depression . H e discussed the importance of exploring the use of neuromodulation tools to advance the understanding and the treat-ment of neurodevelopmental disorders such as depression, ASD, and ADHD . D r . E mslie highlighted the pioneering work of Dr . C roarkin in examining neural biomarkers of suicidality in adolescents . H e commented on the pitfalls discussed in Dr . C ullen's presentation, the chal- lenges that come with this type of work, and also the importance of this research even in the context of small samples . H e commended the approach taken by Dr . A meis in focusing on execu- tive functioning with TMS, since this domain is relevant to so many other psychiatric conditions . H e also under- scored the importance of her findings in identifying a subgroup of youth with autism that showed an improvement in executive functioning after TMS . T his type of research is needed to allow the development of personalization strate-gies . D r . E mslie also highlighted the potential impact of Dr . P edapati's work toward understanding variability, and how identifying biological signatures that distinguish subgroups can provide important clues suggesting pathological mechanisms and pave the way for novel treatment development . m Dr. Elmaghraby is a third-year resident in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Minnesota.

Fritz, AACAP Past President The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), along with the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Society of Child and Adolescent Psychology, the Society for Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, and the Society of Pediatric Psychology, jointly commis-sioned the Milliman Group to analyze a large national database of commercial insurance claims to estimate additional payments associated with co-occurring mental health or substance use disorders in youth with chronic medical condi-tions . T he findings point to potential cost benefits of addressing co-existing mental health and substance use disorders . M ore and more youth experience chronic health conditions . T he new study published in Academic Pediatrics examines a sample of 6 .6 mi llion chil- dren and adolescents ages 0-26 years and 5 .8 mi llion of their parents with commercial health insurance . I n this group, patients with a chronic medi-cal condition and co-occurring mental health or substance use disorders had annual insurance payments 2 .4 tim es larger than those with a chronic medical condition only . M ost of the increase in health care claims reflected medical services rather than mental or behav-ioral health services . T his difference translated to a greater estimated annual expenditure of $8 .8 bi llion . P arents of these children also had total insurance payments 59% higher than parents whose children had only a chronic medical condition . The m uch higher total health care costs for both children and their parents suggest the potential benefits from preventing or reducing the impact of mental health and substance use disorders among children with chronic medical conditions .In tegrated or collaborative care, in which mental health problems are diagnosed and treated within the medical setting in collaboration with medical profession-als, is widely seen as a way to increase access to mental health services and to intervene earlier before problems become more serious . T he degree to which integrated care is adopted across the country depends significantly on financial factors, including whether it saves money, on a per capita basis, com-pared to the current compartmentalized system . T hese new data help support the notion of collaborative care as a strategy to improve health care costs . I ntegrated care approaches may be one of the strategies to prevent or reduce the impact of mental health and substance use disorders in children with chronic medical conditions and their parents . Th is project is notable as the first time these five child-serving profes-sional organizations have pooled their resources and expertise on a project of mutual interest .

Background An estimated 1 in 4 girls will become pregnant at least once by age 20. Pregnancy carries with it negative physical, psychological, emotional, economic, and social sequelae for teen mothers and their children. 1 The increased risks for mental health issues in pregnant adolescents include depression and increased suicidal thoughts. 2 In addition, adolescent pregnancy results in enormous costs to society (an estimated $9.4 billion in 2010).1,2 Adolescent pregnancy disproportionately affects minority racial/ethnic groups and adolescents from households where parents or guardians are of low education and/or low income.1 Pregnancy and childbirth contribute to high school dropout rates and carry a higher risk of repeat teen pregnancy.1,2 Practical and Concrete Implications Despite a decrease in recent years, the rate of teenage pregnancy in the U.S. continues to be higher than that in other western industrialized countries, 1 underscoring the need for continued prevention efforts. The decline has been attributed to increased access to educational materials and reproductive health care (including contraception), through programmatic development and implementation. This has contributed to a reduction in the proportion of teenagers who are sexually active and an increased proportion of those sexually active teenagers using contraception. 1 The most effective programs provide information about the risks of unprotected intercourse and ways to avoid unintended pregnancy, as well as modeling and practice of communication, negotiation, and refusal skills among peers and with parents. 3 Full service health centers in schools where access to health care, including contraception, and education/options counseling are available have proven efficacy.4 Recommendations Based on these data, AACAP: En dorses the development and teaching of curricula on pregnancy, parenting, and sex education throughout the U.S. school system. Re commends that school systems collaborate with local and state health and education agencies to establish medically accurate and high quality comprehensive education that teaches about psychological and physical human growth and development and relationships, and encourages adolescents to make informed, responsible, and safe choices regarding sexual activity. Re commends accessible health clinic programs that provide a full range of services, including confidential counseling and information regarding sexual activity and reproductive health. JANUAR Y/FEBRUARY 2019 57 FOR YOUR INFORMATIONAlthough AACAP supports parental involvement in adolescent decision-making, AACAP recognizes that many adolescents may be less likely to seek necessary health services if required to inform their parents.5 Therefore, laws that empower adolescents to obtain certain basic health care on their own, make decisions regarding reproductive health care, and ensure confidentiality are very important, as they improve access to critical health care services.

An individual AACAP member or body interested in creating a policy statement submits to the Executive Committee a \"letter of intent\" to create a policy prior to developing a draft policy statement. (This allows Executive Committee input of the desirability,appropriateness, etc. of the policy - without constituting any form of approval prior to the substantial work of creating a final draft policy statement.) 2. A final draft policy statement is submitted to the Policy Statement Advisory Group(PSAG) (to ensure that the language, tone, format, etc. conform to AACAP policy standards). 3. The author responds to the suggestions made by the PSAG and resubmits the edited draft until PSAG approval is achieved. 4. The Executive Committee receives the PSAG-approved policy statement and decides whether or not to forward it to Council. Feedback on this decision is given to the author,and resolution of problematic issues is undertaken. 5. The Executive Committee-approved policy is emailed to Council members, who have a two-week discussion period to convey concerns and ask questions followed by a one-week voting period to approve or disapprove the policy. (A simple majority determines the outcome). 6. A policy draft that is disapproved by Council vote may be re-written and resubmitted to the PSAG, with an explanation of what was changed; The process begins again with steps 2-5. 7. Upon Council approval, the new policy is printed in AACAP News , distributed/publicized as recommended, and placed on the AACAP website. 8. The expectation is for policy statements to be reviewed as needed, but no longer than 5 years, with the decision to renew, update, or sunset. Updated policy statements will be sent to the PSAG, Executive Committee, and Council for approval. 9. Committees are encouraged to collaborate with and get feedback from other relevant committees when drafting or updating a policy statement.POLICY STATEMENTS AACAP Policy Statement Requirements Policies should: 1) He lp shape and articulate AACAP's position on important policy issues 2) Be c lear, concise, and as brief as possible (no more than 500 words, excluding references) 3) Ci te current and credible references (5 or less) 4) Be u pdated at least every 5 years Format for Policy Statements: 1) Ba ckground: A summary of the information that provides the rationale for the position taken, including: a.
