That would be eating smarter and some kind of exercise. Whenever I hear thut th~re is a trend, J always wonder how many people it takes to make a trend. It seems if a product is being sold such as all natu\u00ad ral, organic. GMO free. grass fed. stress-free food or supplements or exercise equipment. there must not be too many people needed to make a !Tend. In the advertisements or in the movies. everybody around is happy, eating good stuff and out jogging. kayaking. biking or at the very least, sitting in two bathtubs looking at a sunset. However. when 1 am in a crowd of people at the mall or ball game, I don't see many of those people. True. 1 suppose they are all out jogging, kayaJdng. biking or taJdng a bath; hopefully not in the mall. So I am skeptical about trends. 1 am sure we should be eating both bener and I suppose. less. Again. looking around crowds. evidently the former trend of eating a lot, often and without any health thoughts, along with avoidance of any form of exerc1se still seems to be in the majonty. To be fair, Boomers grew up dunng a time when our mothers tried to give us the healthiest food they knew. I don't think the word, \"nutrition\" was ever used in our house when l was a lcid. There was a lot of food that was good for you and you had to eat your vegetables to get dessert. And you needed to clean your plate to keep children in Africa or India or China from starving. We all know that logic was beyond us as children but if your parents said it, it must be true. But let's get back to the food that was considered good for you. Meat and potatoes were two of the basic food groups. In our family, gravy was normal. Plenty of bread with a generous spread of ~titter was automatically included. How-eLse. did you push your food on your fork? Use a knife? I don't think so; are we British? True, there was usually a vegetable on the plate. The green ones were the greater price to pay for dessert; com with butter and salt was easy. Big glasses of whole milk were standard. SaJad was only when there was special com\u00ad pany and not aJways then. Dependmg on your ancestry, you maybe had other staples like dumplings or pasta or beans. The desserts were the favorites but even they were considered healthy because they were made with good fresh cream and butter or lard and good white flour and the purest sugar. HO\\\\ could that not be good for you? Healthy or not, the food we grew up with tasted great! No wonder we have trouble genmg on board with the new healthy trend.

SANFi ~RD Chamberlain USD\"s Anarchist Professor South Dakota's college profes\u00ad sors get often tugged as being too conservative or too liberal but few have the radicnl backgrou nd of Alexander Pel!, a University of South Dakota at Vcm1illion profes\u00ad sor who was wanted in his home country of Russia for his rebelLious actions against the Czar. After Oceing Russia with a 10,000 ruble price on hjs head, Pel! and his wife adopted new names and moved to Canada and then to the United SLates. At the age of 40. he earned a doctorate at John Hopkins llniversiLy in BuWmore in I 897 and then began teaching math at USD, which had just 4 I 0 students nt the lime. Pelland his wife, Emma, settled comfortably in rhe small university town. He jumped into student culture. playing in chess tournaments, ice skating. entertaining in his home .leading pep rallies and academic debates and taking his tum al chapel exercist:s. The Russ1an expanded his position to include sciences and rallied for a department of engineering. which became a reality in 1903. By 1907, the department was thriving and Pel! becan1e the dean. The former rebel was described as \"a model teacher. an able admintstrator and a kind, generous, out-going friend to students and faculty colleagues,\" according to Von Hardesty and John D. Unruh, Jr. in a 1972 article in South Dakota His\u00ad tory. Emma passed away in 1904 and Pel I remarried a prized former stud em named Anna Johnson from Akron, Iowa. Pell's friend, Dean Lewis Ake\u00ad ley recalled Pell had once stated that girls couldn 'l make it as madlemati\u00ad cians and if one did, \"someone would marry her and spoil it all.\" Determined not to let that happen to hts new wife. Pell resigned at USD in 1911 and moved to Chicago where she earned her PhD nt the Univer\u00ad sity of Chicago and he taught math and theoretica l mechanics at Armour Institute of Technology. Anna went on to a brilliant math career, teaching at both Mount Holyoke and BI)n Mawr. PeU died in 192 I without anyone discovering his dark past in Russia. Born Sergei Degaev, he was raised in a family that openly denounced the repressing Czarist regime. Degae\\ 's mother was the daughter of a well\u00ad known Russian writer and historian and her salon was a popular meeting place for revolutionaries. Degaev dreamed of taking aclion against their ryrannical government in an era when merely criticizing d1e Czar could land a person in prison for years of hard labor. After graduating from military training, where he received top honors, Degaev studied math at the Institute of Civil Engineering. He joined a rev\u00ad olutiomtf) movement called the Peoples\u00b7 Will, an underground group that had one goal-to assassmate Czar Alexander II. One of the projects De\u00ad gaev worked on was creat.inl! a tunnel from a cheese factorv under a road - . traveled by the Czar in order to blow him up from underground. That did- o 'L work but Ill 18R 1 another plot succeeded and the Czar was dead. But the Peoples' Will failed to mstall a revolutionary government and the even more repressive Alexander ill became the new ruler. One year after the successful assassina tion.

When Deguev's comrades were ar\u00ad rested, he realized he had been played. He confessed to the leader of the Peoples' Will, who asked him to execute Sudeikin to atone for his betrayal. Degaev carried out the murder but was still distrusted and was dismissed from lhe group. He was also wanted by the police for Sudeikin 's murder. Degaev realized that leaving Russiu was his best option and his new life as AleJtander Pelf begun. His secret past was never discovered but colleagues at USD remem\u00ad bered one incident that offered a hint of his colorful past. At a football gan1e on an October night, emotions were running high as USD's Coy\u00ad otes played Mitchell away from home and were far outnumbered by local Fans. Some Mitchell youth ripped a USD banner from D cheering student and a fight erupted. Professor Pel! jumped into the fray to defend his stu\u00ad dents.

On Oct. 12, 2010, the State of South Dakota, filed a motion to intervene into the litigation and to move venue from Col\u00ad orado to South Dakota District Court. \"It was and remains the state's position that there is a cons1dt:rabh.: local m\u00ad terest in lhc Norbeck Wildlife Preserve and that South Dakotans have a unique slake in the management of the Norbeck Wildlife Preserve giving rise to a more appropnate utigation forum here in South Dakota.\" said Jackley_ On Oct. 18. 20 I 0, the Colorado DtsLTict Court agreed and transferred the case to Federal District Court 1n Sout11 Dakota.

Cook-Lynn examines America's legacy of colonization By Jesse Abernathy Native Sun News Editor BOOK REVIEW \"A Separate Country: Post\u00ad coloniality and American Indian .Nations\" (Texas Tech University Press) by Elizabeth Cook-Lynn: Writer, poet and professor emerita ofNative American studies at East\u00ad ern Washington University Eliza\u00ad beth Cook-Lynn presents a potent, sobering collection of essays, along wilh two case studies, dnlwn indigcnous ly-\\\\'ilhstood par\u00ad adigm of colonialism in America. The author knows of what she wntes: a member of the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe. Cook-Lynn has lived a lifetime and then some mired in tbe far-reaching clutches of colonialism. Her experiences as a contemporary acadllmicwn with not-so-distant ties to her traditional Hunkpati Dakota past highlight her book and give it the realism needed to effecti vcly make her case for the continuing aftermath of Europe's invasion of the once strictly non\u00ad European coolfnent now refem:d to as North indigenous- and tbeir already tired, and tiresome, perspective of the notion of \"postcoloniality.\" Such a condition does not ex.Jst, she maintains throughout her work: there IS no \"post\" when 1t comes to EUZABETH COOK\u00b7LYNN the lreatment ol' this land's original peoples by America's \"democratic\" and capitalistic government. Colonialism as a condiuon of oppression and control by Christianity-mongering. sel r-serving governmental agents and apparatuses is Sltll alive and well-and Cook-Lynn. a scholar for the masses in her own right. knows it. From her well-earned and well\u00ad respected vantage point as an in\u00ad sider within the interconnected. rather cloistered maze or America's top collegiate mstituuons, the Hunkpal1 professor founds her analysis io this colonial-postcolo\u00ad nial polarity that developed and took hold late last century Within academ1a and focuses pnmarily on its relationship to and placement of the northern Great Plains indigene, A Separate Country Posll:O/on13ftry Ofld Amliln:.ontna ~\" atlons or Native American , which is somewhere JUSt berween a hard. high place and a rock. Cook-Lynn also knows that tn the non-indigene world, most so\u00ad called fTce-thinkmg, informed and mtelligent college and university educators, who arc viewed by her more as rivals or as just plain unin\u00ad formed, have not strnyed far from the ''doctrine of discovery\" manlrn themselves arc exempt- ofU1eir imperialistic gov\u00ad ernance system. I o place for over 500 years, rhe fatally nawed doc\u00ad trine of discovery mantra has been lhe driving force behind any and every action taken agamst this con-lincnt 's lirsl puoplcs by Europe's tnvaders. author this with great acumen and conviction. Movmg from th~: w~:st\u00ad ward expansion of almost two centuries ago and the ensuing, longstanding \u00b7J n\u00ad dian wars\u00b7\u00b7 to the extcrmt\u00ad nat.ion. assimilation and other Indian law policies of the late 19th through mid-10th centuncs to the modem-Ja y governmental concept of gaming and tourtsm as a means of In\u00ad dian economic develop\u00ad ment, a generous assemblage or the maJor players, posers and acts 0f the collecuve Lakota.

Dec Brown, Ward Churchill, John Yellow Bird Steele, the Allotment Act, the Ghost Dance, the Wounded Knee Massacre, the American In\u00ad dian Movcmem and, on top of it all. the male-dominated. detrimentally politicized U.S. Congress. which rs where Cook-Lynn accurately places the scat of colonial power. The two case sttJdies that make up the final third of lhe book focus specifica lly on the use of colonial\u00ad tZed politics and litcralure to assault indigenous peoples. both themed around lhe inherent g~:nocidc of colonialism. Cook-Lynn's first case stuuy looks at rhc era immediately fol-lowing the treaty-making period of thll late 19th century. During. this \"treaty-breaktog\" era, the federal government deliberate ly schemed ever harder to completely and forcibly strip indtgenous peoples ol land, culture and identity. The hal\u00ad lowed Black Htlls, or Paha Sapa, were stolen from the Lakota. Dakota and Nakola peoples by the U.S. government in this era. The author's second case study del\\\"es into lhe \"Little House on for this country's indige\u00ad nous peoples. especially those or the northern Pla1ns. Authored by Laura Ingalls Wilder and originally published m 19:!3. the h1ghly romanticized memoir of a young girl and her set\u00ad tler family seemingly all alone on the vast pra1rie caused an immedi\u00ad ate sensat1on in the non-tndigene world due to its basis in the Chris\u00ad tian values of family, strength and survlVal against the backdrop of the \"harsh. desolate\" environmenl of the upper Midwest at the tum of the I 9th century - a time when the anginal inhabilants of the region were StTuggling to maintain the final remnants of their sovereignty. identity and land in the face of true adversity. \"A Separate Country\" is required reading for every American. Cook\u00ad Lynn indeed remams a force to be reckoned with and a powerful pres\u00ad ence throughout Indian country and beyond.
