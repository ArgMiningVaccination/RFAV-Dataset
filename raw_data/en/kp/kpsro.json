Also, over this past year, we have watched the news and listened to the conversation about the impact of COVID-19 upon healthcare workers; the stresses of being over-worked, anxious, pressured, sense of being overwhelmed, feelings of isolation and depression. In response, the design of medical facilities must include architectural designs that reduce stress and anxiety of the doctors, nurses, and all our frontline workers.

On average, these claims involve indemnity payments of approximately $300,000 or more, plus any claims expense, and the fallout can follow physicians throughout their careers. According to Bill Gompers, CFE, healthcare providers' insurance specialist at Danna-Gracey , the largest independent medical malpractice insurance agency in Florida, the single greatest way that physicians can avoid malpractice claims is through effective communication. \"Roughly 80 percent of claims are the result of poor communication and sys-tem breakdowns,\" he explained. \"Not properly communicating with patients and staff can cause problems that could have been nipped in the bud.\" Manage Expectations According to Gompers, physicians should talk to patients as if they were peers, showing empathy , communicating clearly and providing thorough explana-tions during every point of contact. While many malpractice cases are the Communication Key to Avoiding Malpractice ClaimsBill Gompers HEALTHCARE REAL ESTATEMALPRACTICE INSURANCEDOCTOR'S DAY BY FRANK ASTOR, MD March 30 is Doctors' Day , an annual observance for acknowledging and appreci-ating physicians who we rely on and trust to make us feel better, cure our disease, and even save lives. The holiday first started in 1933 in Winder, Georgia, and since then it has been honored every year on March 30 which was the first anniver-sary of Dr. Crawford Long, an American surgeon, using ether as a general anesthet-ic to perform major surgeries without pain. Eudora Brown Almond, the wife of a doctor in Georgia, believed her husband and other physicians deserved more recog-nition for their hard work and set out to make this idea a reality , exactly 91 years after Dr. Long's remarkable discovery . Some notable facts about physicians: \u0081 In the U.S., there are over 700,000 doctors. \u0081 Nearly half (47%) of graduating med- ical students in 2018 were female. \u0081 Some doctors work as many as 60-80 hours per week \u0081 It can take up to 11 years to become a doctor in the United States. Centuries before coronavirus, plague, smallpox, yellow fever, Spanish flu and other contagions killed hun- dreds of millions around the world. Physicians and med- ical researchers worked tire- lessly to find ways to eradi- cate these deadly diseases. Many of them did their work in a laboratory with lit- tle notoriety or fanfare. Throughout the past year, physicians and healthcare providers have battled the Corona Dragon, risking their lives to make others better. While we say thank you after our clinic visits or annual check-ups, it is now , more than ever that these courageous men and women on the frontline are saluted for their heroism and dedication to the com-munities they serve. Although the publication date of this editorial is March 1, I salute my fellow col-leagues not only on this day , but for the entire month of March and for the past year. We will get through this pandemic. We are grateful to our physicians for lead-ing us through this difficult time. We relied upon you and once again ... you saved lives, cured our symptoms, and made us feel better. Saludos, Cheers and Bravo! Thank You! Dr. Frank Astor is chief medical officer for WITHmyDOC. Salute to Physicians! Dr. Frank Astor Design for Our CaregiversBY SHAWNETTE SADDLER, MD The COVID-19 pandemic has been the greatest public health and healthcare challenge of our time. In the face of this challenge, Broward Health caregivers have remained committed to providing quality healthcare to all we serve. The resiliency of our community and our region has been put on display in the face of COVID-19, and again we have shown our strength in unity and our commitment to one another. As we move into a new phase of the pandemic, with a vaccine that is showing promise in helping us turn the corner against COVID-19, our strength and unity are more important than ever before. The virus has ravaged our region, and it has taken an even larger toll on our Black and Hispanic communities. As we begin administering the COVID-19 vac-cine and seeing its highly effective results, we know these communities have experienced historic issues with access to care and a lack of minority providers delivering care. As a member of the Black community and a healthcare provider, these issues hit close to home for me, particularly in the fight against this deadly virus. The COVID-19 vaccines represent a turning point in the pandemic and the first sign of hope toward widespread recovery from the virus and its impacts. While vaccinations are critical to slowly end-ing the pandemic and keeping our com-munities safe, the underlying mistrust of healthcare providers within minority communities represents another chal-lenge we must overcome together. COVID-19 2 March 2021 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital News\"The practice of medicine is an art, not a trade; a calling, not a business; a calling in which your heart will be exercised equally with your head.\" \u2014 Sir William Osler I am speechless ... and for those who know me, that doesn't happen very often (if ever, according to Carol.) This is our 16th Annual Salute to Physicians and it never gets any easier to express just how important our doctors are to all of us. And never more so, than these past 12 months. Last year, when we were putting our March 2020 issue to bed in late February , we weren't wearing masks and the term \"social distancing\" wasn't even in our vocabularies. But things changed quickly , and little did we know just how bad things would become before there was any light, even a dim one, at the end of the tunnel. And although I think we all understood then how important doctors, nurses, and our entire healthcare community were to our lives, these past 365 days have only served to reinforce our feelings. So, whether you are an experienced physician, a fledgling medical student, or new practitioner, we can only say a simple heartfelt Thank You ... and hope you know and believe how much you mean to all of us.

Among its items for the 60-day session is the budget to govern state spending for 2021-2022. Funding the state's Medicaid program, a criti-cal safety net program serv-ing nearly 4.5 million Floridians, without cutting payments to hospitals and other providers is key to that commitment. Governor Ron DeSantis released his proposed state budget in late January . While those recommendations are not directives to state budget writers, they are an indication of the Governor's prior-ities for state tax dollars. The Governor's budget proposal makes clear that health care is chief among his priorities. The pandemic will exact a prolonged economic toll on Florida and require sus-tained investment in the health care workforce, infrastructure, preparedness, and continued health care coverage. The Governor's budget proposes no cuts to the state's health care programs, particularly Medicaid, the health care coverage program for low-income par-ents and children, individuals with dis-abilities, and the elderly . Indeed, his rec-ommended 2021-2022 state budget includes a 17 percent general revenue increase to fund the state's Medicaid program to cover the increased costs largely as a result of an increase in enrollment of over 750,000 due to the economic down-turn in our state. More than 4.5 million Floridians rely on Medicaid for health care, a number that increased 20 percent over the course of the pandemic as job losses mounted, and families lost access to employer-provid-ed health insurance cover- age. Along with increased unemployment, the pandemic's impact on the economy also resulted in decreased sales tax col-lections. With greater need for govern-ment services but less revenue, state budget writers have difficult choices to make because not every funding need can be fully met. Going into budget discussions this year, lawmakers must contend with a deficit of over $2 billion, including a pro-jected $1.2 billion shortfall in general revenue for Medicaid. The challenge for lawmakers is that, unlike the federal government, the state's budget must be balanced. By law , there can be no deficit in any state fund. This balance requires tough choices. Prioritizing health care funding in the budget is not about prioritizing buildings or facilities. Hospitals, clinics, and long-term care facilities are nothing without the people within them - the individuals who deliver care and compassion every day . Prioritizing health care funding in the budget is about prioritizing the con-tributions of the hundreds of thousands of physicians, nurses, aides, therapists, and others who daily endeavor to heal wounds, restore function, alleviate pain and suffering, and repair what was bro-ken. It is also about prioritizing a health care infrastructure to ensure that it is always ready , always available, and always capable of responding to any emergency or crisis, whether it involves one person or many . The pandemic has shone the brightest of spotlights on the need for a strong, always-ready health care system. Being ready and responsive 24-hours a day , seven days a week carries major costs, many of which are not immediately obvi-ous to the casual observer. These include around-the-clock staffing of highly trained professionals; an array of equip-ment, supplies, and medications on standby; and the ability to add surge capacity to meet higher-than-usual need for care. A budget, whether for a household or a government, reflects choices and priori-ties. Florida's hospitals and the tens of thousands of individuals who give mean-ing to hospitals' work are relying on state lawmakers to follow the Governor's lead and prioritize health care.

Protecting Health Care in the State Budget Is Critical to Preserving Access to High Quality Care BY MARY MAYHEW Coming next month in South Florida Hospital News and Healthcare Report... \u0081Healthcare Volunteerism in South Florida Healthcare Consulting/Outsourcing \u0081 Insurance for Healthcare Professionals, Businesses, Consumers \u0081Organ and Tissue Donation Awareness For more information on advertising and editorial opportunities, call (561) 368-6950 today!South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com March 2021 5 6 March 2021 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital News BY VANESSA ORR As the co-owner of JKARE, a company that offers clinical respiratory care services and home medical equipment and sup-plies in Miami-Dade and Broward counties, Karen Alba is responsible for mak-ing sure that patients with respiratory issues and chronic conditions have access to the care they need. The mother of a son with cystic fibrosis, she also serves as a patient advo-cate in Tallahassee, FL and Washington, DC, working with policymakers to pro-vide insight into the needs of people with chronic conditions. Alba began the company in 2010 with her husband, who is a respiratory thera-pist. \"We were looking for ways to help cystic fibrosis patients and realized that these types of services were not only needed by the cystic fibrosis community , but by other groups as well,\" explained Alba, who also serves as the company's vice-president and general manager. \"We started JKARE and little by little, we were able to grow into helping other segments of the community .\" The company now provides care to peo- ple with cystic fibrosis, COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, ALS and other neuromuscular diseases and more. In addition, Alba has spent the last 10 years advocating for the well-being of these patients. \"In the beginning, no one wanted to cover the services we provided, so I start-ed with insurance companies and ended up in Tallahassee talking to Medicaid,\" she said. \"I explained how my husband provided care to our son, who has a chronic condition, and how that care, including a daily regimen of respiratory therapy , kept him out of the hospital for more than a decade. \"They started believing me, and now the insurance companies are willing to review coverage on a case-by-case basis,\" she added. \"Not only are they covering the services we provide, but even services that they didn't previously cover.\" When some health insurance regula- tions required that those with chronic con-ditions go out into the community for occupational, physical, speech and respi-ratory therapy , Alba went to battle. \"I called everybody to get that rule changed,\" she explained. \"People making policies behind a desk do not know how their decisions affect people; every single day is a challenge for our patients, and I'll con-tinue to advocate to protect them.\" Alba's current focus is on how the serv- ices that JKARE offers will work for patients who have developed pulmonary issues as a result of COVID-19. \"Things have gotten even more challeng-ing now with providing res-piratory care because of the lack of benefits and coverage from some insurances,\" she said. Originally from the Republic of Colombia, Alba is a huge believer in the power of education. She earned her bachelor's degree in business administration in her home country , and earned an MBA in healthcare management from the University of Phoenix. She completed a paralegal pro-gram at the University of Miami, and also earned a real estate license. \"When my son was diagnosed with cys- tic fibrosis, I wanted to do something dif-ferent than real estate\u2014something that would benefit the cystic fibrosis communi-ty ,\" she said. \"That's when I changed my professional path and started learning new things so I could build a business with a purpose.\" Alba credits her membership in the American College of Healthcare Executives (ACHE) for providing her with the information she needs to make her business a success. \"One day , I received something in the mail from ACHE, and I realized that I could learn a lot by joining,\" she said. \"ACHE has helped me with managing the business, as well as implementing new tools to be ready for changes in the indus-try .\" She adds that her attendance at the ACHE Congress in Chicago in 2016 helped her restructure her business to weather those changes. She also appreciates the networking opportunities that ACHE provides. \"The networking events have really helped us grow the company and become recognized in the community by health-care professionals and referral sources,\" she said of the company's sponsorship of ACHE of South Florida. \"People who you want to know about your company attend those events, so from the standpoint of a business owner, there are a lot of advan-tages.\" Alba adds that she is constantly impressed by the information she gleans through the organization. \"Every time I receive ACHE's emails or magazines, I find something that I can apply to my business,\" she said. \"Whether you're learning about how to improve patient care or increase patient satisfaction or how to run your organization in a dif-ferent way to add revenue, there's always something you can apply to your business and your life as a professional.\" ACHE of South Florida Member Spotlight: Karen Alba, VP/GM, JKARE Let's Connect: ACHE of South Florida Spotlight Karen Alba South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com FOR A VIRTUAL OPEN HOUSE WEDNESDAY, MARCH 17 @ 12 ity icabil iate o Sampl e Course T R R K J U T G F C G N N C W F K X K F P + ive virtual form or in a l in ly onl ake courses ful a T h Compl ete in 23 mont with Health P G O U U G U U C F P C G N Q T at d hir ne, on campus every t s ration OPEN HOUS IN US FOR A IN US @ , , Y Y 12 PM SE SE 8 March 2021 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital NewsBY DANIEL CASCIATO As a private nonprofit insti- tution, South University is dedicated to the intellectual, social and professional devel-opment of a diverse student population. Believing that all qualified individuals should have the privilege of formal academic training, South University welcomes all who seek educational challenges. \"Our flexible learning options allow students to pursue their aca-demic goals in a manner that fits their lifestyles and their needs, says Dr. Mark Everett, Campus President of South University , West Palm Beach. Through programs ranging from associ- ates to doctoral degrees, South University delivers education, support and guidance designed to prepare students to establish and advance careers in areas such as: Physical Therapist Assisting Physician Assistant Studies Nursing Counseling & Psychology Business & Technology Public Health Criminal Justice & Legal Studies Healthcare Administration South University , West Palm Beach has been established in the West Palm Beach area since 1987. It offers more than 40 pro-grams through its campus locations and online learning platforms. These programs focus on workplace needs to meet the employer job demand and community development opportuni-ties. Its degree programs are particularly designed to lead its students to their highest potential by com-bining relevant course-work and applicable expe-rience with supportive fac- ulty in a professional envi-ronment. \"Whether that career finds them working in a hospital, a court-room, or a business, our students get the education that can allow them to be highly competitive in their chosen field,\" says Dr. Everett. South University prides itself on a very robust student support infrastructure that allows students to successfully complete their education. Students can learn and grow in a welcoming environment with supportive faculty and staff who provide one-on-one attention and mentorship from enrollment through graduation. \"Our goal is to help our student to build practical, in-demand skills for pursuing and growing their career, says Dr. Everett. South University's History One of the oldest universities in Georgia, South University was founded in 1899 in Savannah, Georgia. The university was first established as Draughon's Practical Business College focused on teaching the fundamentals needed by suc-cessful businesses including accounting, banking, shorthand, bookkeeping, and typewriting. However, over the past centu-ry , South University has transformed from its humble roots of a two-year college, into a university offering undergraduate, grad-uate, and doctoral degree programs. South University , West Palm Beach has been serving the local community since the 1980s, provides an excellent student experience with quality academic pro-grams, flexible course scheduling and a commitment to always placing students first. Today , the West Palm Beach campus spans two buildings, totaling more than 70,000 square-foot of space, including a landmark clock tower, fully equipped labs, modern classrooms and comprehensive library resources. \"It has evolved as a university providing a supportive learning environment that encourages students to engage with a com-munity of faculty , staff, and students, eager to play a role in helping them achieve their educational dreams,\" says Dr. Everett. Virtual Learning After monitoring the rising COVID-19 cases in early 2020, South University made a decision to move its campus-based stu-dents from in-person learning to a new remote learning format called SouthVR (South Virtual Remote) in the spring of 2020. This format was designed to help students continue their education during the pandemic, while also keeping their safety in mind. SouthVR differs from both campus and online classes by offering live instruction in a remote environment that encourages interactivity and collaborative working groups, while allowing for flexi-bility . The university has experienced success in this modality as students shared that they continued to feel a part of the class-room community with peer to peer and faculty collaboration in real-time, while learning remotely . SouthVR continues to be available for its students and the univer-sity is anticipating its use in the future. Southeastern Florida Sunshine High School Grant Since South University has been in West Palm Beach for over 30 years, Dr. Everett says that they take its goal seriously to continue to be a great local partner and to support the school systems and students on the pathway to graduation. In order to better do so, they have introduced the Southeastern Florida Sunshine Grant which provides financial assistance to high school graduates seeking a college educa-tion. \"It is important now more than ever that we think about how to make the transition from high school to higher education as smooth as we can,\" says Dr. Everett. \"Palm Beach County is a fabulous area to stay , learn, work and grow. It just makes sense to invest in our student's futures.\" The Southeastern Florida Sunshine High School Grant eligible applicants may qualify for up to $1,745* per quarter toward tuition in a bachelors degree program.

South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com March 2021 9As we head into 2021, healthcare providers must confront the CMS's new rule on price transparency . This rule, while intended to help consumers better compare prices across providers, will require significant resources for healthcare organizations to reach compliance at a time when COVID-19 is already straining the system. Despite the challenges, the rule also presents providers with an opportunity to dif-ferentiate themselves from competitors and capture more market share. Before providers can capitalize on strategic advantages, it's crucial to understand what's required. Understanding the Rule Background Price transparency has been a topic of debate for decades. With the passage of the Affordable Care Act, price trans-parency took its first step forward, with hospitals required to post list prices for all services provided. The current itera-tion of the CMS rule originated from President Trump's Executive Order on Improving Price and Quality Transparency in American Healthcare to Put Patients First, issued on June 24, 2019. Requirements The CMS rule applies to most licensed hospitals, who must fulfill the following requirements: \u0081 Providers must be compliant with the CMS rule by January 1, 2021 \u0081 Providers must release all privately negotiated reimbursement rates \u0081 The charges must be published in two formats: 1. A machine-readable file that includes all standard charges for all items and services by physician and non-physi-cian practitioners employed by the hos-pital 2. A \"consumer-friendly\" display of all standard charges, except gross charges, for at least 300 \"shoppable\" services \u0081 70 of these shoppable services will be deter- mined by CMS \u0081 230 of these shop- pable services will be determined by the provider \u0081 Providers must dis- close five types of \"stan- dard charges\": 1. Gross charges 2. Payer-specific nego- tiated charges 3. Discounted cash prices 4. De-identified minimum negotiated charges 5. De-identified maximum negotiated charges Exemptions Hospitals that have a price estimator tool may be exempt from the require-ment to publish a consumer-friendly list of shoppable services. Penalty The maximum fine for noncompliance is $300 per day . Additionally , noncompli-ant entities could lose their Medicare accreditation\u2014this may prove to be a much stronger deterrent for noncompli-ance than a fine. Response to the Rule The American Hospital Association (AHA) filed a suit challenging the rule on the basis that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) does not have the authority to implement it. Although the rule was upheld in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the AHA has already filed an appeal. Providers and health systems have levied a number of criticisms against the rule. First, providers believe that the negotiated prices are proprietary infor-mation in the industry\u2014the government mandating their reveal could have nega-tive implications beyond the healthcare industry . Second, past studies have demonstrated that consumers rarely access pricing information to choose their provider or services, even when it is readily available. Third, the rule could complicate payer-provider relationships and managed care contracts, which pro-vide financial stability and increased rev-enue for providers. Finally , providers claim that compliance with the rule is overly burdensome given the strain many health systems and hospitals are already feeling due to COVID-19. It is unlikely that the result of the appeal will be revealed prior to the January deadline. It is similarly unlikely that there will be a delay in implementa-tion of the rule\u2014although the AHA has asked for a delay , the slow transition process to a new presidential administra-tion and the necessity of prioritizing a pandemic response mean the issue is unlikely to receive attention in the near future. As such, it is prudent for providers to assume the ruling will remain in place in its current iteration and begin preparing for compliance immediately . Compliance and Beyond Complying with the rule will take sig- nificant time, energy and resources. For providers, it may be prudent to seek help from an external firm that specializes in the healthcare industry and technology . Providers can leverage their expertise and access to resources to reach compli-ance as efficiently as possible. Providers can go beyond compliance with the rule to differentiate themselves from their competitors by creating a holistic digital shopping experience for their consumers. By taking lessons from industries like retail, banking and hospi-tality , providers can design an experience that improves patient satisfaction, lead-ing to increases in HCAHPS scores and STAR ratings. Creating a platform that provides consumers with clear and use-ful information will keep them coming back and build consumer loyalty . Complying with the CMS rule will be a difficult lift for providers, especially in the COVID-19 context. However, there are opportunities to leverage this rule to improve the patient experience and cap-ture more market share. Providers should consider their wider goals beyond price transparency compliance before choosing how to design their online experience in order to optimize the ROI of their tool.

If your condition requires a visit to the emergency department, please know we are safe, equipped and ready . 10 March 2021 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital News Every successful service organization has them. Be it the \"My pleasure\" you hear at every Chick-fil-A. Or that you will never see a staff member pointing at a Ritz Carlton. Or how 5-star restaurants encourage employees to 'Beat the Greet' by welcoming patrons before they can say a word. Apple, Tesla, Amazon. The list who have documented service strategies and the customer loyalty numbers to match is impressive, but also remarkably short. Most organizations simply do not get it. If you ask what their secret sauce is to being the brand their clients can't live without, you will either get a superficial response or, even worse, a vacant stare. The same can be said of health care. Most everyone recog-nizes the importance of staff engagement and patient care, but very few have gone through the trouble of building out a foolproof strategy to achieve either. For those thinking: 'I know ours is pretty good, we have a great hiring, training and recognition program'. Please take an objective look at key metrics like 90-day survival rate, turnover and (if you have them) employee satisfaction surveys. Do the results reflect high engage-ment? For those thinking: 'All our patients love us!' Again, look objective-ly at your scores, patient feedback, retention rates and how many simply never return for another appointment. There are employees who have been with the same company for years and would never think about going anywhere else. There, also. are people in this world so loyal to certain brands (and certain medical offices, doctors, and health systems) that they would not think about going anywhere else. Develop a sustainable process that allows you to hire great people and then LOVE coming to work each day , then give them the tools they need to create patient loyalty that rivals the best of the best. Every metric you track will be world class! Jay Juffre is Executive Vice President, ImageFIRST . For more information on ImageFIRST , call 1-800-932-7472 or visit www.imagefirst.com. When It Comes to Patient Care - What Is Your Secret Sauce? BY JAY JUFFRE result of misdiagnoses or sub-par out- comes, others grow out of patient dissat-isfaction. \"You can be kind and gentle, and still be brutally honest,\" he said. \"If a patient says that they're not taking their medica-tions, rather than say , 'It's okay if you for-get,' you need to explain that they are at increased risk, and document that con-versation. \"Physicians also need to manage expectations; you can't promise that a patient will have a good outcome,\" he added. \"One of the best ways to approach these conversations is to under promise and over deliver.\" Documentation Vital Having a complete and accurate med- ical record is extremely important in pro-tecting physicians from malpractice cases, but with increasing use of technol-ogy , this can sometimes be an issue. \"We used to advise physicians to 'write very well,' but now many practices are using digital records that are more checkbox-style than freestyle,\" said Gompers. \"Some people using these sys-tems just check off the boxes, which may not tell the whole story , or they are too rushed to include their comments. \"If you don't document what you talked about with the patient in the med-ical record, you can't prove that it was done,\" he added. \"It may not seem like a big deal to check the wrong box or to skip a step on the EMR's decision tree, but if you're put on the stand, any mis-take could put you on the defensive.\" Stay Up-to-Date Another way to avoid medical mal- practice suits is to stay up-to-date on the latest standards of care. \"Medicine is changing all the time, and while the amount of information is voluminous, physicians still have to stay on top of what's going on in the profession,\" said Gompers, giving examples of different surgical techniques, diagnostic tools and medical therapies. \"There's nothing wrong with asking for help,\" he added, noting the importance of staying current by consulting with trusted colleagues and through the numerous avenues of continuing educa-tion. \"Medicine is evolving so quickly that it's difficult to keep up, but main-taining a practice's standard of care is imperative.\" Informed Consent and Follow-Up Even if patients sign informed consent forms, it's imperative that physicians make sure that they understand what they read. \"I compare it to adding a new app on your phone; most people just scroll down and hit agree,\" said Gompers. \"How many people really read and understand the consent, especially now that much of it is digital?\" Because most patients see numerous people during a visit, including physi-cian assistants, nurse practitioners and others, it's important that all providers ask the patient if they have any questions and document their answers. \"It can be very confusing for patients to go from provider to provider, especial-ly if they are up in years,\" said Gompers. \"This type of follow-up is extremely important to patient satisfaction, and to making sure that the patient understands what they've been told.\" it is also important to make sure that realistic information is relayed. \"If you amputate someone's big toe, you don't want to say that they will walk fine and run effortlessly after a year of rehab,\" said Gompers. \"It's better to talk about how this procedure will improve their quality of life, so that these expectations may reasonably be achieved.\" T o learn more about medical malpractice and healthcare providers' insurance, contact Bill Gompers at bill@dannagracey.com, (888) 777-7173 or visit www.dannagracey.com.

Holy Cross Health has an exten-sive medical group of pri-mary care physicians, spe-cialists and advanced prac-tice professionals who pro-vide an array of services to the community spanning Broward and Palm Beach counties. Holy Cross Health has been serving these com-munities for more than 66 years with a focus that continues to be on providing care to the sick and injured of all races, religions, nationalities or sexual orienta-tions in an environment where your safety is our priority . Holy Cross Health's various Advanced Patient Management programs were established to support better care, better outcomes and lower costs to patients and its health system. Over the course of these six years, Holy Cross has devel-oped a robust partnership with its com-munity providers including skilled nurs-ing and assisted living facilities, home health agencies and other critical service areas. This robust network allowed Holy Cross healthcare professionals to quickly respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 as the safety of colleagues and the communities Holy Cross serves are of paramount importance. The newest Holy Cross Health initia- tive is the reintroduction of the Advanced Practice Nurse Practitioner (APRN) Home Visit Program. The over-arching role of the APRN is clinical care oversight in the home to support a safe transition from hospital to home or from Skilled Nursing Facility to Home within 24 to 48 hours of dis- charge or as it is known at Holy Cross Health, \"Safe Transitions Across the Continuum of Care.\" The APRN will be coordinat- ing care with the hospi- tal's Acute and Post-Acute Care Coor dination Teams. This includes the Emer - gency Room, Population Health and Home Health Care Nurses. This level of care includes physical examinations, initiating clinical orders, for exam- ple, home health for reg- istered nurse, physical or occupational therapist, speech therapist or a social worker and adjusting or adding medica-tions where appropriate in coordination with the primary care provider. The APRN Home Visit Program, in partnership with Sound Physicians, is slated to re-launch March 1, 2021 and will ultimately be offered to all applica-ble Holy Cross Health patients and members across its care continuum. It will be rolled out in a multi-phased approach focusing on the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program Diagnoses and its Alternate Payment Model populations. Holy Cross Health looks forward to extending these offerings to a wider cross section of the population. The APRN Home Visit Program supports the core values of Holy Cross Health, which includes safety , stewardship and rever-ence, as well as Holy Cross Health's mis-sion to serve as the community's trusted healthcare partner for life.

Physician Home Visits - One of the Crucial Roles of APRNs Along the Continuum of Care BY LORRAINE MARSHALL, MSN, APRN, FNP-BC Dade County Medical Association Receives Community Impact Grant from New York Life to Support the Wear a Mask. Save Lives. Campaign Though distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine is under- way , it is critically important that everyone continue to wear masks. As physicians and healthcare professionals, we play an important role in setting an example and edu-cating the public on slowing the spread of COVID-19. It's important that people continue to social distance and wear masks over their nose and mouth while the COVID-19 vaccination process is underway . Even for those patients that have received the vaccine, it remains possi-ble that you can have asymptomatic infections and trans-mit the virus to others who aren't yet vaccinated. This is our best way to prevent the spread of the virus. The Dade County Medical Association (DCMA) and Duval County Medical Society Foundation recently received a joint $25,000 Community Impact Grant from New York Life that will allow our organizations to contin-ue providing essential protection equipment to those who care for the residents in our respective counties. The Community Impact Grant will support our Wear a Mask. Save Lives. Campaign and over the next month we'll be distributing approximately 7,500 KN95 masks to community physicians during a time when mask wearing remains vital. Each year, the New York Life Community Impact Grant program awards grants of up to $25,000 to local nonprofit organizations, which are championed by New York Life agents and employees. Since the program's inception in 2008, more than 600 Community Impact Grants totaling nearly $8 million have been awarded to nonprof-its across the country . We are proud New York Life decided to partner with the DCMA to ensure the Wear a Mask. Save Lives. Campaign is a success. We encourage Dade County physicians to get involved with our organization and the Wear a Mask. Save Lives. Campaign.

E-mail Your Editorial Submissions to editorial@southfloridahospitalnews.com 12 March 2021 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital News BY VANESSA ORR For more than 20 years, Gunn Media has been pro-viding branding expertise to clients. Originally started in Canada by Shawn Rivers, a former defenseman for the Tampa Bay Lightning, the agency opened a second location in Tampa, FL in March 2020. \"It's every business owner's dream to open a new loca-tion during a pandemic,\" laughed Rivers. \"While we had expected to do a lot more face-to-face engagement to entrench ourselves in the community , we've still been quite pleased with the clients we've gained, and are very encouraged about what our future holds in the state.\" Rivers' father worked in the branding industry , and he grew up putting togeth-er trophies and plaques, and working on silkscreen, embroidery and laser-engraved products. After playing profes-sional hockey for nine years, he returned to his roots, and has since moved the company from products used mainly at events and trade shows to ad specialties and corporate clothing. \"As we've evolved over the years, we've added a lot more products, talent and employees,\" he said. When Janet Perkins, who worked at the company for 13 years, moved with her family to Florida, Rivers saw it as a natural progression of his business. Perkins now oversees the Florida office. Having been in the business for so many years, the team knows the impor-tance of branding and how to help clients stand out. \"Our entire business model is set up around working with clients who view marketing and brand awareness as top-of-mind for them growing their busi-ness,\" said Rivers. \"Branding carries a lot of weight and credibility; look at the suc-cess of companies like Reebok and Nike. \"We help our clients determine how to best integrate into the market to reach their demographic, whether that's their own client base or their employees,\" he added. \"That's where we really shine.\" \"We ask a lot of ques- tions about who they are and how they want to be perceived by the end-user,\" added Perkins of their process. \"We have access to hundreds of thousands of different products, so we use this knowledge to whittle it down.\" As times have changed, so have the types of serv-ices that clients expect. \"One area that has evolved over the years is design,\" said Rivers. \"We've come across plenty of clients who have nothing but a name and some clip art that cousin Johnny did for them, which is impossible to work with. We have three full-time designers on staff to help; even if clients are starting from scratch, we can get them into the game.\" He adds that quality counts, which is why it's important for clients to invest their money well. \"It's better to do fewer products that are more poignant and are of higher quality ,\" he said. \"Instead of spending $10,000 on 10,000 cheap pens, they might want to target more strategic clients with a better product; something they won't just throw in the garbage.\" Some of the most-demand items are focused on technology , even with people working from home. \"The demand is greater than ever for phone chargers and adapters, phone lights for Zoom calls and even mugs that plug into the com-puter to keep your coffee warm,\" said Rivers, adding that his favorite is a device that covers the camera on a laptop so that workers can control the narrative on Zoom calls. While companies are used to branding for clients, one area that is often over-looked is branding for employees. \"Now that people aren't in the office, it's important to boost morale to keep employees engaged,\" said Perkins. \"Our clients are requesting more of an 'experi-ence' for their employees; for example, something that comes in a kit that they can unbox during a Zoom meeting.\" Instead of hosting a large Christmas party , for example, companies are using those budgets to provide appreciation gifts. \"These work so much better than just an email, especially if the CEO or man-ager includes a personal note,\" Perkins added. \"It's nice for employees who are working from home to realize that every-one is in the same situation and that they are appreciated; it really brings the cor-porate culture home.\" To this end, Gunn Media has expand- ed into the logistics arena. \"Where clients used to accept orders in their shipping departments, now they prefer that we individually box and send these gifts to clients and employees, which means we're putting more thought into packaging, costs and logistics than before,\" said Rivers. The company is excited about all of the opportunities it sees in Florida, working with everyone from healthcare practices to the cannabis industry . \"While we're relatively new to the area, we've been doing this for a long time, and we're excited to share our experi-ence,\" said Rivers.

Ever wonder what is the easiest way to make your legal department better? The short answer is creat-ing checklists for everything you can. And if you ever wondered how you can save legal department money? The answer is a well-established library of templates. Checklists are used from performing surgeries to putting a man on the moon, so why not have a checklist for your attorneys. It is obvious that checklists work well in regular situations, but espe-cially well in highly complex situations. \"They catch mental flaws inherent in all of us - flaws of memory and attention and thoroughness,\" said Dr. Atul Gawande (surgeon), the author of The Checklist Manifesto. There are \"simple problems\" like what to do when entering into an independent consulting agreement or baking a cake. There are \"complicated problems\" like what to do when a specific situation arises, like negotiating an intricate scope of work or an operating agreement. In the world of law , we are besieged by \"simple prob-lems\" more often than \"complicated problems,\" like what essential clauses go into an affirmative defense to raise when a particular claim is filed, or compli-cated ones, like how to navigate Stark and Antikickback Statutes (AKS) or how to negotiate toward a particular outcome in a settlement, while minimizing risk. Our firm uses checklists for precisely these sorts of scenarios. One way to save time and money is to use templates. The rule of thumb is if you have a particular type of contract or pleading that arises more than 3 times in any given year, the legal department should have a template to accommodate that situation. The templates are not the same as a checklist, although many practitioners use them as that. Simply make a list of what business relationships your company strikes regularly and frequently and create a relevant library of templates. Our firm helps clients build a library of templates that are cus-tomized to the clients' needs. We regularly use our internal template library to get our clients what they need faster and at a lower cost. To find out more about how you can use checklists to raise the level of per- formance and speed in your legal affairs, join us at a seminar on T uesday , March 2. Register at https://bit.ly/2Ydow5h.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Kumar has played a pivotal role in treating patients who suffer from the most severe symptoms, while also serving as a leader for all ICU caregivers. \"Being a physician, it's not just about your knowledge. I think it's also about how you treat others,\" said Dr. Kumar. \"In medicine you can't do this by yourself, you must have a team with you. In the beginning of the pandemic we were all scared, but the care team came together. Once we all put our minds together it became much eas-ier to handle this pandemic.\" Dr. Kumar was recognized in November 2020 for his leadership during the COVID- 19 pandemic with an Excellence in Healthcare Award by the Greater Fort Lauderdale Chamber of Commerce. He also received the Humanitarian Award from the Indo American Press Club (IAPC) at the International Excellence Awards in October 2020.

The procedure reveals polyps that can be removed before they can develop into cancers of the colon and/or rec-tum. \"Cancers in this area are very often preventable, treatable, and beatable,\" said Lao, the mother of two children. \"It requires a strong partnership between doctor and patient and a tailored, multi-disciplinary approach. Our surgical proce-dures, whenever possible, are minimally-invasive.\" Now in her second year in the Memorial Healthcare System after completing fellow- ship training in colon and rectal surgery , Lao appreciates the MHS culture. \"Every patient, doctor, and staff member is valued, which leads to people doing the right thing. We're all focused on making the decisions that lead to the best patient outcomes.\" Kristina Khazeni, MD Dr. Kristina Khazeni, a general surgeon, has a very hands- on approach to patient care, and that's not just in the operating room. She takes ownership of her cases, before, during, and after procedures are performed. \"I enjoy patient contact and a deep connection with those under my care,\" said Khazeni, who has been fellowship-trained in minimally invasive surgery . \"I'm usually available in-person, on the phone, or through Memorial's MyChart app/website. This intimate approach was reinforced through-out my training and I like to keep close tabs on those who trust me with their health.\" Dr. Khazeni joined Memorial Healthcare System in 2020 and focuses her practice on intra-abdominal pathologies that include the spleen, adrenal gland, gallstones, hernias, reflux disease, and disorders of the small intestine and colon. Her specialty training includes laparoscopic and robotic surgeries, skills she brings to a surgical group based on the campus of Memorial Hospital West. MEMORIAL HOSPITAL MIRAMAR Ramon Ramirez Melendez, MD In more than 30 years of practicing medicine, Dr. Ramon Ramirez Melendez, an infectious disease specialist, never imagined he'd see what he's seen in the past year. Intensive care units constantly filled with critically-ill, COVID-19 patients, some of whom ultimately passed away despite the best efforts of the care team. While it can be hard to find a bright spot amid all the suf- fering, Ramirez Melendez cites his growth as a leader as one positive that helped colleagues struggling with the reality of the situation. \"I became a sort of head coach for the team, a guide that could provide information about what we were facing while there were so many unknowns.\" Ramirez Melendez sees some light at the end of the tunnel, although he cautions that the coronavirus will remain a significant problem in the time to come. He is buoyed, however, by the fact that some of the sickest are recovering quicker with medication and that vaccinations will keep others safe from infection. Alvaro Visbal, MD Memorial Hospital Miramar had its first COVID-19 patient a year ago and while there aren't as many people hospitalized compared to peak levels in 2020, the current patients are just as sick. \"It hasn't stopped,\" said Dr. Alvaro Visbal, associate medical director for critical care medicine at Memorial Healthcare System. \"We're still caring for some patients for months at a time.\" While taking care of the pandemic's most seriously ill has taken its toll on all frontline workers, one positive for Visbal is that it solidified his belief that critical care medicine was his true calling. \"I'm passionate about helping people, especially those whose lives hang in the balance. The victories we have over COVID are very satisfying and motivate all of us to continue doing what we do. I'm driven to understand why things happen within the body and leading the effort to fix those problems for the patients and families we serve.\" MEMORIAL REGIONAL HOSPITAL SOUTH Andrew Chang, MD Dr. Andrew Chang, a physiatrist and interventional pain specialist in the Memorial Healthcare System, treats individu-als that range from 'weekend warriors' that have gotten injured exercising to those that have suffered back or neck injuries in accidents. In all cases, patients want functional outcomes that preserve their quality of life. \"Our focus is on relieving pain without the use of opioids,\" said Chang, a musculoskeletal specialist that also performs minimally-invasive, non-surgical procedures. \"If we can address the problem before the pain becomes chronic, that leads to better outcomes.\" Chang joined the MHS family in August 2020 and says he most enjoys the patient interactions and the opportunity to have immediate impact, with the goal being to get those under his care feeling better and back to doing what they love. Jeremy Jacobs, DO The increased reliance on telehealth during the time of COVID-19 has been a boon to the type of patients served by Dr. Jeremy Jacobs, many of whom have lost limbs and wear prosthetic devices. \"There aren't a lot of doctors who specialize in this area of the outpatient experience,\" said Jacobs, who is program direc-tor for physical medicine and rehabilitation within Memorial's Graduate Medical Education program. \"Primary care physi-cians and vascular surgeons often don't have the time or resources to provide a high level of care to amputees with prosthetics. I've been able to physically evaluate patients throughout the state through video apps and either provide orders for necessary procedures or, in some cases, to get them a replacement prosthesis.\" The doctor says he has been able to assist nearly 100 patients through telehealth, with the goal of increasing functionality and improving the quality of life for each. MEMORIAL HOSPITAL PEMBROKE Brett Cohen, MD Dr. Brett Cohen sees bariatric patients and views the weight loss surgeries he performs as tools for patients to utilize on their weight-loss journey . \"Many of those we see have adapted their lives to accommo- date their weight,\" said Dr. Cohen, Chief of the Bariatric and General Surgery programs for Memorial Healthcare System. \"After the surgery and recovery process, it's a whole new world for them. They gain confidence and see themselves in a way that they have not been able to in the past.\" Dr. Cohen started the Memorial Weight-Loss Surgery Program nearly two decades ago, after completing a fellowship in advance laparoscopy and bariatric surgery at the University of Southern California. Since that time, he's impacted countless lives, including patients that loose in excess of 150-200 pounds. \"Patients look to us for help and are so grateful we can help them change their lives. I've seen people go from having difficulty tying their shoes to chasing their kids around Disney World without any trouble. It's an extremely rewarding process for both us and our patients.\" Michael Estreicher, MD A self-described \"run-to-the-fire kind of guy ,\" Dr. Michael Estreicher is a specialist in emergency medicine. In cases where information is limited and a patient's life hangs in the balance, the doctor and his emergency department team are at their best. \"It may look chaotic, but we're experts at managing the situation. It's important we keep calm, cool, and do what's necessary to get that patient on the road to recovery ,\" said Estreicher, a married father of three children. The graduate of New York's Sackler School of Medicine has always been drawn to helping people in their greatest time of need, and the COVID-19 pandemic feels like Estreicher's \"natural territory .\" He says the teamwork required to care for coronavirus patients while also attending to those in the emergency room requires a staff that operates like a finely-tuned orchestra. It's what he likes best about working within the Memorial Healthcare System. \"Ours is a team environment, where each person respects the others and works well together.\" SALUTE TO PHYSICIANSMEMORIAL REGIONAL HOSPITAL Jeremy Song, MD While it couldn't have been pleasant at the time, a common skin disorder is what Dr. Jeremy Song credits for his interest in medicine. \"I had psoriasis as a child and wasn't allowed to play with other kids because my family thought it was contagious,\" said Song, now a cardiac surgeon. \"My life changed when I was diagnosed and educated about the condition by our family physician.\" Nearly 30 years later, Song aims to have the same impact for patients with considerably more complex problems, operating on those with a variety of cardiac issues. \"It's instantaneous gratification when during a bypass procedure, for example, you literally see the heart wake up as a result of what we've done.\" The opportunity to improve lives, as his once was, is the reward for Song as he watches patients grateful for a second chance make healthy lifestyle choices and pursue hobbies that would have previously not been possible for them to do. Simon Buttrick, MD While he had been interested in medicine as a child, it wasn't until he read \"Saturday\" that Dr. Simon Buttrick's career path became clear. The Ian McEwan novel features a neurosurgeon as its main character and it gave the future physician his first glimpse into the technical and human com-plexity of the field that would become his passion. \"I've done hundreds of craniotomies, but continue to learn each time I see the brain up close,\" said Buttrick, whose fel-lowship training came in surgical neuro oncology . \"I'm fasci-nated by how it makes us who we are.\" Buttrick specializes in treating a variety of brain tumors, using minimally-invasive techniques, whenever possible. Those include trans-nasal approaches for pituitary tumors, tubular retractors for deep-seated lessons, and laser interstitial thermal therapy for inaccessible tumors. He also performs spine and open vascular neurosurgery , using a minimally-invasive mindset to ensure less pain, time in the hospital, and better cosmetic and functional outcomes. MEMORIAL CANCER INSTITUTE Constanza (Connie) Guaqueta, MD Dr. Connie Guaqueta, a hematologist/oncologist at Memorial Healthcare System, believes one size definitely doesn't fit all when it comes to treating breast cancer. \"The research being done in clinical trials is enabling us to tailor treatments that are specific to each cancer,\" said Guaqueta. \"We can now better match medications to an indi-vidual's cancer profile and improve survival rates based on what we we've learned about the differences within the dis-ease.\" Dr. Guaqueta has been part of the Memorial Cancer Institute (MCI) for nearly two years and appreciates the multi-disciplinary approach that involves not just clinicians but also therapists, social workers, integrative medicine, and financial professionals. Recently named a \"Florida Center of Excellence\" by the Florida Department of Health, MCI and its doctors, including Dr. Guaqueta, will soon be training physicians in a hematology/oncology fellowship that is part of Memorial's Graduate Medical Education program. Pablo Ferraro, MD Dr. Pablo Ferraro has been part of Memorial Healthcare System for more than 15 years and has seen some significant changes. \"We've gone from a community health facility to one that is now an academic medical center offering fellowship training in hematology/oncology ,\" said Ferraro, one of the program instructors. Memorial's Graduate Medical Education program will train five physicians each year, something Ferraro says will keep his skills sharp. The teaching position completes a training circle for Ferraro, who was inspired by a mentor during his own fellowship to specialize in cancers of gastrointesti-nal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) systems. Ferraro is also active in cancer research as the principal investigator for primarily phase 2 clinical trials conducted in collaboration with other institutions and industry partners. His leadership in the studies provides his patients access to experimental drugs and allows the doctor to focus his efforts on solid tumor oncology , gastrointestinal malignan-cies, and general hematology . MOFFITT THERAPY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL WEST Jose Sandoval-Sus, MD, FACP Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy , which involves genetically altering white blood cells and transfusing them into patients with certain types of tumors to recognize and kill cells harboring specific cancer-related proteins, will soon be available in Broward County to treat advanced B-cell lymphomas and leukemias. \"This will provide new hope for patients that did not respond to standard treatments and, in some cases, had been given just months to live,\" said Dr. Jose Sandoval-Sus. \"The advancements in immunotherapy , made possible by all those who have participated in clinical trials, are extending the lives of patients and potentially contributing to the cure of their disease.\" Sandoval-Sus, a native of Colombia that completed an oncology and hematology fel- lowship at Moffitt Cancer Center in 2017, was the primary investigator for a Phase 1 CAR-T cell therapy clinical trial for multiple myeloma last year. He encourages all those who are eligible to participate in research to do so, especially Hispanics, African and Caribbean-Americans, ethnic groups that are susceptible to some types of blood cancers and traditionally underrepresented in clinical studies. MEMORIAL PRIMARY CARE Lori Frisard, DO Dr. Lori Frisard has a standard prescription for the patients she sees suffering with diabetes, high blood pressure, and obe-sity . 'Prevention' isn't found at the pharmacy but is something the family medicine physician preaches to the adults she cares for. \"A healthy diet, regular exercise, consistent sleep, and mind/body balance go a long way toward improving health and overcoming chronic illnesses.\" The educational compo-nent is a large part of the long-term relationships she fosters with her patients, whether she sees them in-person or, increasingly in the age of COVID-19, through telemedicine. The video connection has been well received by both doctor and patients, and it's an aspect of primary care Dr. Frisard believes is here to stay . \"I can see a time where there might be a face-to-face visit once a year, with telehealth used the rest of the time.\" Dr. Frisard is tri-lingual (English, Spanish, and German) and was in private practice for a decade before joining Memorial Healthcare System in 2020. Mark Rabiner, MD Dr. Mark Rabiner feels it's his role as an internal medicine specialist and primary care physician to knock down the bar-riers to healthcare that keep patients from moving forward. This is especially important when working with marginalized populations. \"I've been in places where people with no safety net are discharged from the hospital with a prescription for medicine, but with no money to pay or transportation to get to a pharmacy , they inevitably end up hospitalized again,\" said Rabiner. \"Some see that as a social worker's issue and not a doctor's problem, but I'm not one of them.\" That's why Rabiner was so excited to join Memorial Healthcare System in 2018 after a lengthy career in New York that included work at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center, Mount Sinai Hospital, and NYU. \"Memorial is, hands down, better than them all. The resources doctors and patients have access to here impress me every day .\" South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com March 2021 15SALUTE TO PHYSICIANS FLORIDA MEDICAL CENTER Erik Beyer, MD Dr. Erik Beyer, cardiothoracic surgeon is on staff at Florida Medical Center.

JOE DIMAGGIO CHILDREN 'S HOSPITAL Syndi Seinfeld, DO Dr. Syndi Seinfeld joined Memorial Healthcare System late in 2019 to build a pediatric epilepsy program that included a surgical component. Despite the onset of the pandemic short-ly after her arrival, the medical director at the Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital Neuroscience Center says the program is already a success. \"Our first surgery for a patient with intractable epilepsy took place in June of last year and, to date, the individual is still seizure-free,\" said Seinfeld, who is board certified in Child Neurology and Epilepsy , and a Fellow of the American Academy of Neurology (FAAN). \"We're also active in research for non-surgical candi-dates and have established support groups for both English and Spanish-speaking par-ents.\" Despite being relatively common, one in 26 will have an epileptic seizure in their life- time, the disorder is still widely misunderstood. Meanwhile, Dr. Seinfeld and her multi-disciplinary team continue to look for answers for those with recurring seizures, with renewed hope for surgical, medication, and dietary options.

Caring for her friend taught her the importance of being able to educate and advocate for the dignity and benefits of hospice care, both to patients and family members who embrace it, and to those who are resist-ant to it or do not fully understand the philosophy and practice of comfort-focused end-of-life care. \"I absolutely love what I do,\" says Dr. Khan, who still maintains a private practice in Broward County . \"Meeting patients and families and developing a rela-tionship with them allows us to understand their goals of care near the end of life, an approach that I find more rewarding than my previous role as a hospitalist, which required aggressive treatment of patients who would not necessarily benefit from such care.\" Dr. Khan earned her medical degree from The Santiago University of Technology School of Medicine. SALUTE TO PHYSICIANS VITAS\u00ae H EALTHCARE - D ADE & M ONROE COUNTIES Carmen Cabeza-Romero, MD What began as a part-time role as a float pool physician has evolved into a 20-year career as a full-time hospice physician for Dr. Carmen Cabeza-Romero. A graduate in internal medicine from the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Dr. Cabeza-Romero transitioned to the hospice specialty after realizing \"how much I enjoyed sitting with patients in their homes, getting to know them in a more complete way , and chatting with their families in one-on-one time. In an office or hos-pital setting, as much as we'd like to develop that type of true relationship with our patients, we're often very busy and don't have the time.\" Formerly an internist with Mount Sinai Medical Center, Dr. Cabeza-Romero manages two teams that provide end-of-life care to VITAS patients and their families in their homes and nursing homes. She found at VITAS \"heightened excellence of care because we use a multi-disciplinary team approach to med- ical and psychosocial care. We get to know our patients and families in a more complete way , in their homes, and we gain a deeper understanding of what they really need.\" VITAS\u00ae H EALTHCARE - B ROWARD COUNTY Dillobar Gelfond, MD When Dr. Dillobar Gelfond was growing up in Russia, she had no doubts about her career path. Both her parents were physicians, the \"perfect role models\" for a compas-sionate young person: \"I never questioned which field to choose,\" she says. Dr. Gelfond fully realized her passion for care while studying at Second Tashkent State Medical Institute in Uzbekistan. She discovered the hospice specialty during her residency at Weiss Memorial Hospital in Chicago. After a residency at Meharry Medical College and continued hospice and palliative training at Alvin York Veteran Affair Medical Center, she under-stood that she had found her calling. At VITAS, Dr. Gelfond feels \"support at every step as we work,\" and appreciates the many ways the company enables her to provide care. \"In the moment that you take a patient's hand, you feel like you're in the world for something,\" Dr. Gelfond says. \"I think I'm designed for this world; I'm designed to talk to people, to ease their pain.\" South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com March 2021 27 Thank you for being there when it matters most.

A hospital is a stressful place; so, from the moment patients arrive and throughout their visit, design should not add to anxiety but instead serve to calm and comfort people during their period of anxiety . Medical workers are under intense pressures and anxieties as they recog-nize their responsibility to provide heal-ing and comfort to large amounts of peo-ple in critical need. COVID-19 patient volumes and limited supplies have stressed out workers to new levels. In addition, these workers' emotional engagement is heightened by becoming stand-ins for family members no longer allowed to come visit. They provide emotional comfort in addition to med-ical care, and that emotional toll on healthcare workers has been significant. How can we alter our designs to pro- vide calm and lift the mood of workers during this trying time? Natural light/biophilic architecture is imperative to reach healthcare workers. While daylight is desired, well designed, ambient light may boost moods and relieve stress. Excessive or uneven light can lead to mental fatigue, visual dis-comfort, and amplify stress. Direct light, indirect light and task lighting must be well thought out and designed. Just a few minutes of looking out a window at trees or water can reduce anxiety and stress. When designing call centers for 911 operators, spaces are included for decompression and counseling after par-ticipating in and listening to a stressful call. This is not an employee lounge or coffee station, and it would be prudent to have similar spaces within a hospital where workers can grab a moment of emotional decompression as they run from one critical COVID-19 patient to the next. Here, staff respite areas should be painted with neutral colors to pro-mote a calming effect. Design to reduce clutter is a critical component of reducing stress and assist-ing healthcare workers. We need to design spaces where all the equipment used has a planned space to be located so that rooms and hallways do not look like obstacle courses to get around. How do we design spaces to accommodate additional equipment without clutter? I am not speaking about bringing in emer-gency equipment for a code, but about the equipment lining rooms and hall-ways in a surge that adds to an emer-gency nature of the event and increases stress to the healthcare worker. Cluttered spaces exaggerate stress because it adds an element of search to a dynamic medical situation. Equipment and mobile carts need to be identified and space planned. Noise adds to stress. The action of healthcare and the open space work areas do become issues for healthcare workers when it comes to noise and pri-vacy . The COVID-19 requirements of heightened workloads and an additional level of urgency requires designers to balance controlling noise and employee privacy . Not a privacy lounge, but as employees are charting, on an important call, trying to coordinate medical instructions and medicines, the noise of the surrounding activities can be a deter-rent to being accurate and certainly adds stress as the worker struggles to listen and get it right. Ultimately part of the lesson learned is that our medical space designs should not create or amplify stress in our healthcare workers; just the apposite - the design should enhance calmness, health, and efficient medical attention.

One of the biggest shifts was the rate at which retailers entered the healthcare market or expanded their existing healthcare offerings. In the coming year, healthcare will continue to act as a safe har-bor for retailers looking to right the ship in tumultuous seas. This ongoing intersec-tion between industries could play out many different ways. First Testing, Soon Vaccinating One way retailers forayed into health- care in 2020 was by offering services spe-cific to the COVID-19 outbreak itself. Companies like Target, Walgreens and CVS opened up their locations as free test-ing sites for the virus. CVS alone adminis-tered six million tests between March and September. Providing vaccinations is also a way to encourage customers to come back to stores and could help win over some new shoppers\u2014but only if retailers provide a seamless experience without 'long lines and chaos'. Medical Malls on the Rise Minute clinics, pharmacies and mini health centers have become mainstays at big box stores over the years. But in 2021, healthcare services will take over retail real estate at an even higher rate. Retail sites are ideal for redevelopment since they typ-ically have adequate utilities, parking and entitlements (zoning) for hospital and health care users. Many of these spaces will hold reimagined medtail (medical + retail) spaces, such as \"super clinics\", \"micro-hos-pitals\" and other specialty care. Expanding Contactless Healthcare Limiting human contact was the theme of 2020. Curbside pickup, grocery delivery and contactless payment were a few of the ways retailers provided safe transactions for their customers. We may see a wave of new partnerships to enable contactless healthcare flows, or new contactless healthcare technologies developed by large retailers. Recently , CVS signed a con-tract with PayPal and later became the first national retailer to offer contactless Venmo and PayPal technology at checkout registers. It is likely that more retailers will partner with care providers or expand their own offerings to facilitate contactless healthcare delivery . Not Every Venture Will be Successful While retailers like Walmart have seen success from its healthcare expansions, others have not been as successful. In 2021, a safe prediction is that there will be more missteps from big retailers trying to get a piece of the healthcare market. T wo to watch may be \"Google Health\" and Amazon HealthLake.

Looking at the recent reports from the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which use the latest data on every state's intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital bed capacity as well as its social distancing policies, many U.S. states are once again facing bed shortages, this time due to the post-holiday surge. Working long hours and late nights, our frontline heroes are not only running low on stamina and supplies - they're also run-ning low on space. Last fall, we worked with our colleagues to assist AdventHealth, a longtime Gresham Smith client, in preparing their system for medical surge capacity , which is defined by the CDC as a facility's ability to provide adequate medical care during events that exceed the limits of their nor-mal medical infrastructure. Our team is hopeful that AdventHealth won't need to use their surge plan, but even while hop-ing for the best we're also preparing for the worst. Keep reading to learn how we're using creative thinking to create a flexible, adaptable surge plan that will give health-care providers the space and resources they need to care for the communities we call home. Looking at the Numbers To begin the surge planning process, our team re-oriented ourselves with the AdventHealth Altamonte Springs and Waterman campuses, facilities that we've had the pleasure of working on before. The Altamonte Springs hospital has six floors and under normal circumstances utilizes 346 beds. Waterman is a 6-story building that can typically accommodate 300 beds. Additionally , Waterman's new patient tower includes one floor of shell space that was constructed while planning for future growth back in 2017. Using a template provided by AdventHealth, we began analyzing the number of existing rooms and the number of ancillary spaces that could be converted to hold beds at each facility , keeping in mind the spaces we would not touch: staff lounges, offices or cafeterias. We entered the data in the spreadsheet as we went, uti-lizing software to analyze the number of beds possible for different surge levels. Taking a Tiered Approach The uncertainty of the pandemic creates many question marks when it comes to critical care. To create flexibility , the team developed three different tiers of care within the surge plan. The first tier of the surge plan works under the assumption that most patient rooms can be doubled up - instead of a sin-gle bed in the middle, two beds can be placed against the walls and still utilize the in-room medical gasses. The first tier also maintains only one bed in each patient room in the intensive care unit and only one patient bed in negative air isolation rooms. The second tier takes advantage of clin- ical treatment areas that already have med-ical infrastructure in place, such as med-ical gasses and electrical supply . Our team did bed calculations for operating rooms, prep and recovery areas, exam rooms, clin-ical treatment areas, cath labs and imaging departments and created a floorplan for each scenario. The third tier plans for utilizing lobbies, conference rooms, waiting areas and the chapel, understanding that these areas have no infrastructure in place - it's only space. In this scenario it's a full blown surge unit, however caring for patients indoors is better than caring for patients under an outdoor tent or in a parking garage. Investigating the Infrastructure At AdventHealth's Waterman campus, we worked with a local engineering firm to understand how the hospital could alter the HVAC system to maximize space in their nine operating rooms and an old car-dio procedure area. By switching several of the rooms from positive to negative pres-sure, the hospital could create isolation rooms and a full pandemic ward. Additionally , our team investigated ways to take advantage of the shell space, rec-ommending HVAC modifications and methods for piping medical gas to the area. We provided a footprint for patient beds, clean rooms, toilet rooms and support spaces, as well as recommendations and pricing for portable headwalls and parti-tions. Every hospital has its own floorplan, however starting with the numbers and staying organized, creating flexibility through a tiered approach, and making sure the correct infrastructure is in place to handle new configurations are key to suc-cessful surge planning. While we ultimate-ly hope that AdventHealth will not have to rely on their medical surge plan, we hope that our healthcare heroes are prepared to provide critical care if and when that day comes.

South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com March 2021 33 HEALTHCARE REAL ESTATE, CONSTRUCTION, DESIGN & FACILITY PLANNING AdventHealth Plan Salah Foundation Children\u00eds Hospital has completed a $52 million expansion of its Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) that will enhance the immediate and long-term outcomes of infants born at risk. Designated as a Level III Regional Perinatal Intensive Care Center (RPICC), this is one of only 11 RPICC sites in Florida where a comprehensive team of board-certified neonatologists, nursing specialists and pediatric special-ists provide comprehensive, multi-disci-plinary care for critically ill newborns. The three-year, two-phase expansion transformed the original 63-bed, one-floor open-concept ward at Salah Foundation Children\u00eds Hospital into a state-of-the-art 70 private bed-unit on two floors where families can stay overnight with their babies. The floors will be divided into Level III acute beds for more critical patients and a Level II progressive unit designed for babies ready to go home. The units will soon allow parents to see their babies when they aren\u00edt able to be present at their bedside with NICVIEW web cam-era system technology , and parents will be able to view their newborns 24/7 with a secure password-protected video streaming technology . Funded in part by the Broward Health Foundation, which raised $23 million dollars for the renovation, the focus of the NICU is on the needs of both infants and their families and offers integrated services such as child life, music therapy and pastoral and social services.

With support from CITY Furniture, the project is now open, giving the hospital's team respite from a healthcare environment that has never been more challenging and stress-ful. CITY Furniture donated comfortable new outdoor furniture that's in place in Holy Cross Health's central Mercy Courtyard for fresh-air breaks by staff. The hospital has just finished transform-ing a portion of the courtyard for the new Resiliency Garden, with butterfly-attract-ing plants, basketball hoops and a bean-bag toss game. A canvas sail will soon shade areas of the garden. The Resiliency Garden design maximizes the Mercy Courtyard's potential and recognizes the need for social distancing and outdoor space usable in varied weather conditions. Creating an inviting \"getaway\" and encouraging colleagues to take breaks out- doors, the project is a timely response to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Inside the hospital, CITY Furniture has donated furniture for the newly completed Serenity Room, including executive massage chairs and recliners to help health-care team members decompress and re-connect. \"Holy Cross Health is beyond grateful for the thoughtfulness and generosity of CITY Furniture,\" said Mark Doyle, the hospital's president and CEO. \"The new outdoor furniture is a welcome addition to our Mercy Courtyard that's already making colleagues' break times more comfortable and allowing them to resume patient care energized.\" CITY Furniture's donation of furnishings for the courtyard and Serenity Room is the latest commitment in its long-term support of Holy Cross Health. The com-pany and its owners, the Koenig family , have donated more than $1 million to the hospital in recent years. CITY Furniture CEO Keith Koenig serves on the Holy Cross Board of Directors, and his late wife Doreen, who died of breast cancer in 2015, was a leader in making major initiatives including the Holy Cross Women's Center a reality . \"It's so important for staff, nurses and doctors to have spaces where they can relax and recharge,\" said CITY Furniture President Andrew Koenig. \"We know from our own family's experience that the Holy Cross Health team delivers remarkable patient care. We're inspired by these professionals every day and glad to lend our support,\" he added.Holy Cross Health, CITY Furniture T eam Up to Deliver Haven for COVID-Stressed Healthcare Colleagues CITY Furniture donated furniture for the newly completed Serenity Room At Holy Cross Health, including executive massage chairs and recliners to help healthcare team members decompress and re-connect.

Bethesda Heart Hospital Completes Advanced Endovascular Suite Bethesda Heart Hospital's new advanced hybrid endovascular suite features state-of-the-art technology that will benefit patients with speedier, more precise care when facing complex cardiac and vascular conditions. Bethesda Heart Hospital, located on the campus of Bethesda Hospital East, a part of Baptist Health South Florida, is now the first in Palm Beach County \u2014 and one of few in the nation \u2014 to feature the highly sophisticated Azurion with FlexArm imaging system by Philips. The suite also includes the first commercial release of Philips Xper3 information management system for physio-monitoring, reporting, inventory and data management. Azurion with FlexArm represents a significant advancement because it allows unprecedented image quality from a wide vari- ety of angles, using a pivoting C-arm and gantry suspended from the ceiling. The FlexArm rotates on no less than eight axes to create virtually unlimited imaging options from head to toe for both two- and three-dimensional visualizations. That flexi-bility frees up medical teams to choose the best working position without the need to reposition the patient or adjust the oper - ating table, important safety and time considerations. Image-guided therapy , in which treatment is performed through a small incision and guided by imaging technology , is increasingly replacing open surgery for the treatment of many diseases. Patients experience less trauma and, as a result, their hospital stay can be dramatically reduced. They often return home after one night in the hospital, and may even leave the hos-pital on the same day . Correspondingly , the procedures are also becoming more complex, requiring more physicians from different disciplines to be at the patient's tableside, working together in a highly coordinated way . Clinicians need to be able to quickly and easily visu alize critical anatomy and identify changes to the patient during procedures. The new suite can seamlessly accommodate both minimally invasive procedures and traditional open surgery , allowing cli- nicians to pivot in their surgical planning when necessary . The new advanced endovascular suite will be used for more complex procedures such as transcatheter aortic valve replace- aneurysm repairs. South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com March 2021 35 HEALTHCARE REAL ESTATE, CONSTRUCTION, DESIGN & FACILITY PLANNING BY LOIS THOMSON With more than four decades of experience in the construc- tion business, Craig Danto and his wife Debbie have devel-oped a firm that is capable of handling most projects in the design build field. Debbie Danto explained that her husband is a fourth-generation builder who came to South Florida well over 40 years ago, and has done every type of construction imaginable. \"We're a design build firm,\" she said, \"which means we love to take a client from concept through completion, and even beyond that, because of other services we offer. We are able to start with the client with a complete design build team so everyone understands the project - their vision, their goals, their budget; even tax incentives, and how to maximize those to give a better ROI. So there really are benefits to starting with the design build team up front, and then working with the client all the way through construction.\" Danto said she and her husband have always included med- ical facilities as part of their business, but they really started focusing on that after the downturn of the market. Before that they were building a lot of custom homes and multi-family developments, but when the market dropped, they realized they would be wise to diversify . \"We said we need to focus more on the healthcare industry , and with aging baby boomers and the increasing older population here, we knew that was a good segment of the market to focus on. We design and/or build medical office buildings, and build out separate medical offices like ear, nose, throat; MRI centers; primary physician; dental offices; patient rooms; and miscellaneous medical offices.\" They have also completed renovations for Broward Health and Holy Cross over the last decade. Danto pointed out that Danto Builders is a woman-owned business, which has enhanced its growth. The changeover was made four years ago when she was in a meeting with Broward Health and they explained their diversity program. \"I under-stood the competitive advantage of being woman-owned, so I got my GC license and we made that transition. We're a WBENC firm, which is a national woman-owned business designation. We made that transition so that we could be more competitive with hospitals like Broward Health, and we are an approved woman-owned contrac-tor for them.\" Danto emphasized that whether a project is large or small, each one is given the same attention. She mentioned a younger couple they helped - both of whom were doctors who wanted to buy real estate and open their own medical office. \"That's smart, because that's their nest egg - they eventually will retire but will still have this real estate. But it's very challenging because the bank wants plans and budgets before they approve the loan. So we had to help them expedite plans and they had to put money down for plans even before they knew they were going to get the loan. That's a tough situation.\" She mentioned trends that are currently taking place in the industry , saying that more facilities are focusing on telemedicine than on brick-and-mortar, especially since COVID came on the scene. However, she added that hospitals do not want to feel ster-ile, but rather feel more like a hotel. \"That's great for us, because our strongest background is probably in hospitality - hotels and restaurants. So we are able to bring that into hospitals and make them feel comfortable; that's been an ongoing trend and I'm sure it will continue. An ongoing focus, especially with COVID, is maintaining safety in hospitals with cleaner air, which is also part of what we do.\" Danto believes that their Midwest backgrounds enhance the quality of their serv- ice. \"Craig is from Michigan and I'm from Ohio, and we both are very down-to-earth and ethical. We're hardworking, and we take a personal interest in clients. If it's not a big job, it doesn't matter, we're going to treat it the same and with the same urgency , because we know that's (the small customer's) livelihood.\" Danto said all of this works well because she and her husband are partners/owners. \"He was born and raised in the business and has tremendous construction and engi-neering knowledge. I come from the business side, so I oversee operations and administrative processes; and we're both in business development.\" She said they also care about the community , serving on boards and being engaged in various activities such as holding fundraisers for Special Olympics, and now helping young people learn about the trades and helping to get them enrolled into a certification program. \"Craig and I are very involved with our clients and community . We are thankful to our team and colleagues for helping us make everything happen.\" For more information, call (954) 229-2006 or visit www.dantobuilders.com. Danto Builders' Owners Do It All Debbie and Craig Danto PHOTO CREDIT : JASON LEIDY, MIDDLE RIVER ARTS PHOTOGRAPHY Jupiter Medical Center has long been the region's leader in cancer treatment, providing world-class cancer care for more than 35 years. However, with the recent opening of the iconic healthcare facility's new 55,000-square-foot Anderson Family Cancer Institute, Jupiter Medical Center's new era of early detection, diagnostics and treatment sets the bar to which hospitals across the nation aspire. The facility is state of the art, bringing together multidisciplinary cancer experts, the most sophisticated treat-ments in the field and unique amenities designed for patient and family comfort and healing. The Anderson Family Cancer Institute enables patients to visit one place for physician appointments, lab work, radiation therapy , chemothera-py , infusions and support services. Virtually all services at the center are integrated into one location, allowing patients to see multiple oncology special-ists and support team all in the same day , and receive a comprehensive treatment plan so they know what to expect from diagnosis through survivorship. This is a remarkable concept for patients and their families who already carry the bur-den of a cancer diagnosis, versus the logistics of having to travel to multiple locations over the course of sometimes weeks potentially delaying their care. The institute also holds Jupiter Medical Center's cutting-edge radiation technology , including a TrueBeam Radiotherapy System, which precisely target and destroys cancer cells while preserving healthy tissue, the CyberKnife\u00ae M6 Robotic Radiosurgery System, which treats tumors nonsurgically and Electron Beam Intraoperative Therapy (e-IORT), which reduces the number of radiation treat-ments for breast cancer patients. This technology rivals that of any major aca-demic medical center. With 31 private infusion rooms, patients can receive chemotherapy and other types of infusions in a calm-ing environment outfitted with specialized chairs to maximize comfort. Features at the Institute designed to enhance patient and family comfort and sup-port include: \u0081 A healing garden for patients and family to gather and visit \u0081 A 45-seat auditorium for physician/patient educational events with outdoor seat- ing \u0081 A 2,000-gallon saltwater aquarium filled with salt water tropical fish to aid relaxation \u0081 A Patient Resource Center equipped with computer stations \u0081 Publix Pharmacy for easy access to filling prescriptions \u0081 And a boutique and lab will be com- ing soon The Anderson Family Cancer Institute also marks a transformative point because it allows Jupiter Medical Center to further build its medical oncology division, complementing a growing team of renowned surgical oncologists and radiation oncologists. This exceptional team includes Dr. Debra Brandt, Director of Medical Oncology . A board-certified, fellowship-trained, hematologist/oncologist, Dr. Brandt will be expanding the oncology clinical trials program, offering patients a broader range ot treatment options. Local clinical trials allow participation in state-of-the-art research about cancer or hematologic disorders without having to travel long distances. Prior to joining Jupiter Medical Cen - ter, Dr. Brandt was Assistant Professor of Clinical Medicine at Smilow Cancer Hospital in Yale, Connecticut, and served as Medical Director of the Torrington Care Center in the Yale New Haven Health System. Her distinctions include multiple \"Top Doctor\" awards, and a Yale Cancer Center Award for Clinical Excellence.

The Anderson Family Cancer Institute at Jupiter Medical Center, Marking a New Era of Cancer Care from the T reasure Coast to South Florida 36 March 2021 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital News 954-964-1660P.O. Box 19268 Plantation FL 33318 I was out working in the yard last week and you wouldn't know that it was still mid-February . I remember when we first moved down to South Florida in the early 90's and you could depend on having nice weather almost to May ... not so much now. If it isn't global warming, then what is it? P .S., not \"global warming\" is also responsible for the early onset of pollen season. Look at your driveway and your cars, it is already here. The pandemic has caused many of us to think about the way things used to be. Schools, clubs, pick-up basketball games, movies, and healthcare, will they ever be the same? Will I ever get to go to Disneyworld and not wear a mask from this point forward? Return to Napa and enjoy tasting rooms without worrying that I might become infected? Have we also seen the last days for hospitals operating from processes they started in the 1960's? Hospital operating margins had declined by 96 percent through June of 2020 as reported by Kaufman Hall. Operating margins declined to 0.3 percent by the end of 2020 and that result was only made better by the infusion of cash from the CARES Act funding. With that added cash, operating margins were still only 2.7 percent. As I shared many months ago, the plight of rural hospitals wasn't good then. Some forecasters several years ago were saying that a significant portion of rural hospitals would slowly disappear. You just need to look at Becker's and you can see that happening ... hospitals becoming urgent care centers and the distance that rural American's have to travel to get care for a critical health situation is increasing dramatically . In a recent report by Paul Keckley , he said that \"Per Chartis, 453 rural hospitals are in danger of closing and most (77%) have 33 days or less of cash on hand. Per Deloitte, by 2030, revenue from inpatient services will decline by 35% and demand for inpatient beds will shrink by 44%.\" The way we used to run hospitals worked well in the past but today , maybe not. What this says is that hospitals are going to need to change and innovate or risk becoming a statistic. Fiscal pressures will continue with the federal deficits and state budget downsizing. Even with the cost cutting that hospi- tals have done over the last ten years, it isn't enough. A new paradigm is emerging. Revenue constraints, the rise of the consumer, the aging of the healthcare workforce, the perfect storm is on the horizon. With all these challenges, forward-looking healthcare systems will survive and do well. They will invest in their most valuable resource, their employees, and fashion responses to these challenges. The responses will be price transparency that has meaning, governance that brings in the best and the brightest to add value to the leadership team, and a keen focus on ensuring that there is an ample supply of providers (physicians, nurses, and techs) to stabilize labor costs and ensure access. While the pandemic exacerbated the process, the innovative culture that has been fostered by technology , that challenges the old norms, is hard at work. What we are seeing is the death of an old paradigm and the birth of a new one. A new paradigm is created where everyone along the continuum of care has some input into the care being delivered to every patient. The days of silos in the provision of care and the recordkeeping associated with that care are over. Integration will be an important and necessary part of this new paradigm.

North Broward Hospital District Board of Commissioners Advances New Broward Health President/CEO Contract Negotiations The North Broward Hospital District Board of Commissioners unanimously voted to name Shane Strum the next President and Chief Executive officer of Broward Health. Most recently , Strum has been serving as chief of staff to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. Prior to his work with the state, Strum served as senior vice president at Memorial Healthcare System in Hollywood, Florida, where he was part of an executive team that managed over 15,000 employees and an annual budget more than $2.4 billion. He also oversaw Memorial's strategic planning, marketing, community relations and global health functions. Before he joined Memorial's executive team, Strum served on the South Broward Hospital District Board for several years, including two terms as chair-man. In addition to his healthcare experience, Strum has exceled in higher education, having served as vice chancellor of Keiser University and director of corporate and gov-ernment relations at Nova Southeastern University . Dean Appointed to Nursing's T op Advisory Council At the onset of her career, Cindy Munro knew she wanted to be a nurse scientist and was thrilled when the predecessor to the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) awarded her a fellowship to pursue her doctoral degree in 1989. The investment paid off: While working on her Ph.D. at Virginia Commonwealth University , Munro was part of the team that showed how oral bacteria infect heart valves, a find-ing that led to the first of three patents Munro holds with co-investigators. She went on to lead research that showed dental plaque was a risk for pneumonia in patients on mechanical ventilation, and led to practices that changed the oral care guidelines for intensive care patients. Now , more than three decades later, the dean of the University of Miami School of Nursing and Health Studies is equally elated by her four-year appointment to the NINR's National Advisory Council for Nursing Research. \"I couldn't be more thrilled to serve on the advisory council, which is a really important voice for the NINR,\" said Munro, who was inducted into the International Nurse Researcher Hall of Fame in 2016. \"Their early sup-port was instrumental in starting my research career, and I have such admiration for the work NINR does. I look forward to making a contribution to their mission in this way .\" Gino R. Santorio Joins Mount Sinai Medical Center as President and Chief Executive Officer Mount Sinai Medical Center welcomes Gino R.

Dr. Lisai Zhang MAKINGROUNDS...MAKINGROUNDS... Dr. Mariana Berho BY LISETTE HILTON University of Miami Miller School of Medicine researchers are recruiting health care workers to study whether a wearable device, a wristwatch, can capture real time data that can be used to alert wearers of subtle physio-logical changes that may indi-cate they have become infect-ed with COVID-19. The goal of the research is to prevent COVID-19 transmission in health care settings by letting wearers know that they may have been infected before clinical signs or symptoms of the virus start, according to Frank J. Penedo, Ph.D., associate director for Cancer Survivorship and Translational Behavioral Sciences at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center and pro-fessor of Psychology and Medicine at the Miller School of Medicine. \"The wearable device employs an algorithm to captures early signs for res-piratory infection. We are recruiting 70 health care workers who do not have COVID-19 and have opted not to get the COVID-19 vaccine. We are asking that they wear the Empatica E4 watch for 30 days during non-working hours. Participants will also take a daily nasal swab to detect whether they have sero-converted to COVID-19,\" Dr. Penedo said. \"The idea is to be able to pull bio-metric data such as temperature and heart rate together to see if there is a way to accurately predict seroconversion to COVID-19 prior to the development of clinical symptoms that otherwise might not be detected.\" Conceptually , the early warning sys-tem could prompt wear-ers to get a COVID-19 test to confirm results from the wearable, then quarantine with less risk of spreading the virus, he said. Miller School researchers have been among the pioneers in conducted National Institutes of Health funded trials looking at wearable devices for var- ious applications. Many of these devices capture biometric data, including heart rate, skin conductance, temperature, heart rate variability , sympathetic nerv-ous system activation and other markers that suggest stress, illness and more in real world settings. Some studies use the devices to monitor sleep quality , work-day stress or the body's reaction to recre-ational activities. \"When you put it all together you have a pretty comprehensive set of bio-logical data that can give you a picture of how the individual is functioning prior to developing overt symptoms of dis-ease,\" Dr. Penedo said. This multisite study , funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), is looking for subtle changes that take place in an individual's physiological functioning that might not be noticeable but are indicative of being infected with the virus, including even slight changes in temperature.

Researchers Recruiting for Wearable Device Study That Might Help Detect COVID-19 Upon Infection Wristwatch With systemic health and social inequities placing many people of color at an increased risk of getting sick and dying from COVID-19, Broward Health is working closely with state and local authorities to help ensure safe distribu-tion of vaccines to all groups, especially people of color. We are committed to enhancing community access to this life-saving vaccine, as well as providing edu-cation to members of our community , enabling them to make the best decision about the vaccine for themselves and their families. When it comes to the vaccine, safety is a top priority . The federal approval process for all vaccines, including those protecting against COVID-19, requires rigorous testing and trials to prove the vaccine is safe and effective, and we have seen the U.S. vaccine safety system effi-ciently and properly work to ensure that all vaccines meet these criteria before distribution. The vaccines that have been currently approved under emergency use authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have proven to be 94-95% effective in preventing serious illness from COVID-19. If you have questions or hesitations, I encourage you to contact a physician or healthcare provider you trust to discuss more. It has been almost a year since the first patients in Florida were diagnosed with COVID-19. We now have the chance to deploy our most effective tool yet in curbing COVID-19: a vaccine that can return a sense of normalcy . I encourage everyone, especially people of color and those with high-risk health conditions, to consider receiving a vaccine. While we are currently only vaccinating communi-ty members over the age of 65 and patient-facing healthcare providers, that will soon change and it will be your turn to receive the vaccine. Please, consider being vaccinated as together we learn from this pandemic and enjoy a healthier future. Dr. Shawnette Saddler, Internal Medicine, Broward Health Physician Group.

First, we must specifically define what Cannabis is: The Cannabis plant can represent any combination/ratio of Cannabinoids, Terpenes, and Flavonoids, administered via different delivery methods, the pur-pose of which is to exert a therapeutic effect. \u0081 Cannabinoids are compounds like THC, CBD, CBG, CBN, that interact with System \u0081 Terpenes are compounds like Myrcene, Limonene, et al. that interact with our Endocannabinoid System and give cannabis products their smell \u0081 Flavonoids are compounds like Quercetin, Apigenin, et al. that interact with our Endocannabinoid System and give cannabis products their color The cumulative action of the above 3 agents at the receptor sites of our Endocannabinoid System are what we refer to as the \"entourage effect.\" In order for us to understand the Cannabis plant, we must first examine its two fundamental characteristics: Heterogeneity - There is no single enti- ty called Cannabis (refer to above defini-tion), hence there are multiple strains, chemovars and cultivars which can be used to target different pathologies (Off-Label of course). Pleiotropy - There are multiple uses/applications for the Cannabis plant and its derivatives (Off-Label of course) These fundamental characteristics are at the ROOT of the current conflict. How?? As physicians, our pharmacological \"tool box\" that we are trained on in Medical School/Residency/Fellowship is based on FDA-Approved molecular isolates in fixed doses at fixed frequencies. These isolated compounds have gone through double-blind controlled studies/clinical trials; the end-result is availability at your local phar-macy with prescription. Keep in mind the following: The Heterogeneity and Pleiotropy of Cannabis precludes us from approaching it in the same manner as FDA-Approved molecular isolates that make up our cur-rent pharmacopeia. Isolates can be patented and sold as a fixed agent. For example, the drug Epidiolex is 99+% isolated plant-derived CBD. No Terpenes, Flavonoids, or other Cannabinoids. However, the absence of these other important compounds limit the overall long-term efficacy of FDA-Approved/Cannabis-Derived medicines such as Epidiolex, Marinol (Synthesized THC in a sesame oil capsule), or Syndros (Synthesized THC in liquid form). The fact of the matter is this. A 5000+ year-old plant with its level of heterogene-ity/Pleiotropy cannot be patented like you would a proprietary isolated compound. Therefore, we must adjust the way we look at/approach Cannabis and appreciate its properties in their proper context. This brings us to our current catch-22 situation. Cannabis' Schedule-1 status pre-vents the proper research from being done. However, in the current research \"culture\" of the U.S., unless a company can get a patented isolated compound at the end of the research rainbow , it is just not worth it for them to spend money on some-thing that they may not be able to get their money back on. These companies make their money back when the compound being researched is Patented, FDA-Approved, and sold at retail pharmacies. When it comes to its use in patients with various cancers, cannabis is used with 2 purposes: 1. Alleviate the chemo-associated nau- sea and vomiting and increase appetite in those patients with malignancy-associated anorexia. 2. Unlock the anti-tumor effects of Cannabinoids as a therapeutic adjunct to Chemotherapy (Off-Label of course) The first time that the potential for anti- tumor effect was seen was in 1974 at the Medical College of Virginia. Lewis Lung Adenocarcinoma in mice was inhibited by the oral administration of THC 1. While researchers made that observation, they had no idea why it happened or what the mechanism was. It wasn't until 16 years later in Israel where Dr. Raphael Mechoulam et al. discovered the components of our Endocannabinoid System. Over time, researchers were able to figure out the mecha-nism by which cannabis acts on malignant cells. To put it concisely , when Cannabinoids attach to the cannabinoid receptors on the malignant cell (CB1, CB2), it triggers a cascade of intercellular reac-tions, the end result being what is called apoptosis, or programmed cell death (\"cellular sui-cide\"). The healthy non-malignant cells, on the other hand, do not undergo such a process, thereby sparing the healthy cell. This is just the tip of the iceberg. There is so much more research that needs to be done in this area. While the concept is there, the main challenge before us is how to weaponize that in order to give patients the best results while at the same time minimizing harms. More to come. Dr. Michael J. McKenzie is a Board Certified Family Physician, Diplomate of the American Academy of Cannabinoid Medicine, and Member of the Society of Cannabis Clinicians.

MCKENZIE, MDthe company and Dr. Matt explains that they have been talking about the health ben- efits of cannabis for many years, even before it was legal in the state of Florida. \"Cannabis really interested me because we had many patients coming in with dead- ly overdoses from prescribed pain and anxiety medications.\" says Dr. Matt, who is also one of the lead ER physicians at a level one trauma center in South Florida. \"I started looking at cannabis as a potential treatment for pain and anxiety control here in Florida, even before it was legal.\" This led to him writing a book called Dr . Matt's Plan: Living Longer and Healthier . In that book, he added a chapter about cannabis and how it could potentially help peo-ple with many symptoms, including preventing overdoses from opiates and benzo's. \"That's what we were dealing with at that point of time,\" he says. \"We witnessed tragic and deadly overdoses on a daily basis from medications that were prescribed by physicians. I thought maybe one day the State of Florida would make cannabis legal to try to get away from all these overdoses happening.\" Once One Plant launched, Cobb asked Dr. Matt to join as the Medical Director, because of his knowledge of the industry . \"I decided to stay away from the recommending side of it. I was more interested in the administrative duties and the back end of developing quality medicine for Florida patients,\" adds Dr. Matt. \"I enjoy the administrative duties that came along with this position which also allows me to interact with recommending physicians and their patients. It's amazing interacting with like-minded physicians and helping patients with quality medications grown by One Plant.\" Dr. Matt stresses that every MMTC in the state of Florida is required to have a Medical Director. \"The Office of Medical Marijuana (OMMU) left medical marijuana treatment cen- ters to designate the roles and duties of a Medical Director on their own,\" he explains. \"Our duties revolve around the thought that we must maintain growing quality med-icine for patients. We oversee the whole grow process to make sure only high quality medicines make it into patients hands. All of One Plant's medicines are third party tested and generate certificates of analysis (COA). This COA documents that there are no molds, no pesticides, heavy metals, and describe which cannabinoids and terpenes are in the medicine.\" Dr. Matt is currently conducting a questionnaire study with cannabis patients in Florida. This study further demonstrates the need for more natural therapies such as cannabis for many conditions. \"We're trying to pinpoint what patients are looking for,\" he says. \"From my data so far, we're learning that 85% of the patients who are taking cannabis are doing it instead of opiates for pain control. In addition, over 90% of patients are using cannabis instead of benzodiazepines or sleeping aids for sleep and for anxiety . People are leaning away from these pharmaceuticals and toward cannabis, which is safer for patients.\" Finally , Dr. Matt says that he's excited that the health industry is finally opening up to a natural medicine that exists in nature. \"It's throughout the world,\" he says. \"Seven years after writing about it in my book, cannabis is becoming more publicly available. We now have other modalities for treat-ing certain diseases, especially pain and anxiety . I think it's exciting to be in the State of Florida right now when these doors are opening up.\" For more information, visit www.oneplant.us. 44 March 2021 cannabisnewsflorida.com Cannabis News FloridaBack Cover Story: One Plant's Dr. Matt Discusses the Importance of Medical Directors for MMTCs Continued from page 40 AROUND THE REGIONTM Cannabis News Florida cannabisnewsflorida.com March 2021 45 TM Subscribe to...

Talking to my tribe today on more than one occasion within that day , I found myself having conversations around the word JOY. It was serendipitous that this 3-let-ter word was on the minds of those around me, because I was truly feeling it and actively manifesting it every day . Feeling joy can be tantamount to our self care and also self identity especially for the community I identify with (queer, black, kinky and polyamorous) To be a minority , within a minority , within a minority (yeah imagine how I feel...ha!) the small victories that affirm and validate who you are can be the single most exuberant experience of your life. But alas that doesn't happen every day , so how do we cultivate, multiply and share our JOY? In my sisterhood of the cannabis community , I see and am inspired everyday to not give up on myself. No matter how difficult no matter how rough we always find a way through, heck that is stoner culture too, isn't it?! I have seen through some incredible black women, queer women, latinx women and also kinky women. How resilient we are and how and where that joy resides. The whole history of cannabis is about resilience and joy . The freedom that it grants you the open mindedness and the ease of connection and the thought of hey I know everything is going to be alright. Isn't that what joy is? As with everything it starts with US! How can we embrace our natural gifts, talents and skills if we are always looking down at others and their talents that are different than ours? When will I realize that my black girl magic is equal and in proportion to my sister's joy? They are not only one and the same but they are contingent on each other. I always loved the phrase \"Your vibe attracts your tribe\" this is truth and I experience it every day! When I make space to rejoice and foster my tribe's joy my joy in turn is doubled. Now THAT is the real MAGIC of my sisters in cannabis and all girls.

If the plant is able to be cultivated and processed correctly , every part of it can be used. This opens up more revenue streams. Besides the potential of hemp, there are a few other things that excite Linton about the cannabis industry . \"Globally , governments are increasing- ly not ignoring cannabis, which means that scientists, entrepreneurs, general voters, and consumers all have access to it and they all want to do different things,\" he says. \"Like scientists, we talk about cannabis, but cannabis is a plant. And inside that plant there are at least a hundred components, but we usually only talk about CBD and THC. That means there are 98 things in there that we don't know enough about. What excites me is trying to have the opportu-nity for everybody to unlock the poten-tial of all of the components of the plant.\" For Linton, that means a lifetime of work for many people because the human body's endocannabinoid system interacts with those components. \"But we don't know which ones go where and in what quantities to cause what,\" he says. \"And so access leads to science, science leads to outcome. The number of outcomes that could be derived are exponential compared to the ones that we know of already .\" Finally , it's the consumers themselves that excite Linton. In places like Florida, he says that there are more discerning, knowledgeable, and informed consumers. \"As a result, over the next two or three years, things will get more interesting because people are not just asking if they have any cannabis, but in what format, what function, what dosage,\" he says. \"There's now a solid base of access and you will soon see a massive acceleration and really sophisticated consumption of knowledge and format.\" For more information, visit www.brucelinton.com.

Patients who might not be inter- ested or able to consume cannabis through inhalation might find our Nano Chews or Drops an ideal alternative due to the faster onset afforded by our cutting edge NANO technology . \"We believe cannabis is not one size fits all and the experience is different for everyone,\" Garcia says. \"Our dispensary associates work tirelessly to find what best suits each patient's needs.\" South Florida has become an attractive market for Curaleaf for the simple fact that Florida is one of the nation's fastest-growing medical cannabis markets in the country . Over the past decade, the cannabis landscape in Florida has changed drastically and continues to evolve, with over 465,000 medical patients currently enrolled in the Medical Cannabis Program. \"Since the beginning of COVID-19, we have seen a steady increase in new patients,\" says Garcia. \"The Florida mar-ket is a big focus for Curaleaf and we aspire to be welcoming and inviting to each community we serve. One way we do this is by offering 50% off the first purchase for new patients, the most aggressive discount in the state. Our goal is to make it affordable for new patients to try a variety of products and find what works best for their needs.\" There have been some minor chal- lenges that Curaleaf has encountered in the cannabis marketplace. For instance, the cannabis industry as a whole is up against the challenges that result from archaic stereotypes that stigmatize the use of the plant. \"At Curaleaf, we strive to re-shape stereotypes by providing education and transparency through community and physician outreach,\" says Garcia. \"Although there is still a lot of work to be done destigmatizing the consumption of cannabis, we have seen a wider accept-ance with some of the more challenging demographics as they see friends and family benefit from the medicine. As patients feel more confident in sharing their stories, cannabis continues to gain acceptance, which will ultimately allow for increased access to the consumption of quality medical cannabis.\" Curaleaf is committed to be the world's leading cannabis company by trailblaz-ing the industry in customer focus, edu-cation and accessibility to high-quality products backed by science. According to Garcia, Curaleaf has a strong leader-ship position and significant scale in most of its 23 U.S. state markets and are at or near a market leading position in nine states. \"It is our goal to be No. 1 in each of our states over time,\" she says. \"In the short term, we just opened the doors of our 100th dispensary and are looking toward the continued expansion of our product portfolio and retail footprint, both in Florida and on a national scale. We also aim to establish ourselves as a leader in diversity and inclusion, in part through growth of our corporate social responsibility program.\" Its Rooted in Good initiative aims to do business with 420 new cannabis brands, ancillary suppliers and advocacy organizations from underrepresented communities in the cannabis ecosystem, with plans to continue to grow and expand the initiative in the future. \"We believe that being the industry leader in cannabis, with the resources required to blaze the trail, can not only be good for business and patients, it can be good for communities and social causes,\" says Garcia. \"As the leader, we believe in investing over the long term - in people, programs and places. At Curaleaf, we work to have a positive impact on the lives of not only our employees, our patients and customers, but also the communities we call home. In each state that we operate, we maintain close relationships with our local commu-nities, from hiring to supporting neighbor-hood programs, volunteer efforts and fundraising.\" For more information, visit www.curaleaf.com.

On the West Coast, they've pretty much had cannabis everywhere all the time for about 30 to 40 years. Five years ago, you couldn't find cannabis anywhere on the East Coast. Today , in Florida especially , not only do they have it, but you can ask questions such as: Where did you get it? What strains do you have? Access is the hallmark of success which Florida has right now.\" After leaving Canopy Growth, Linton started Collective Growth in 2020. He founded it as an SPAC, or special purpose acqui- sition company . This essentially means it's a listing on the NASDAQ and Linton, who currently serves as the chairman and CEO, has $150 million in the bank which he needs to figure where to invest in. Hemp has his attention at the moment. \"We started with a focus on putting together a combination of assets that currently use hemp,\" he says. However, after looking at about 170 companies, Linton found it was going to be more difficult and take a little longer than he originally thought. So he did a transaction with a driverless car company that created a technology that fits in driverless cars. \"You may wonder how does hemp and this technology relate? Well, they don't really\u2014but they kind of do,\" he says. \"Their technology is the incumbent technology in BMW . BMW's new cars should come out in the upcoming year.

That's part of the reason why it has a Medical Director. Matt Ferenc, D.O., FACOEP , or Dr. Matt as people fondly call him, joined the One Plant team in September 2019. Dr. Matt's interest in cannabis was the result of dealing with different kinds of medical issues for the first 13 years of his medical career. Chronic diseases and dependence on medicines especially nar-cotics were dependent on the pharma-ceutical industry . Medications such as opiates and benzodiazepines were tragi-cally over prescribed leading to severe dependence issues and deadly medica-tion overdoses. He noticed that states such as California and Colorado started using cannabis for many medical condi-tions. Pain control and anxiety issues were by far the most popular medical conditions where cannabis helped tremendously .
