Click to Enlarge Image HISTORICAL BACKGROUND Medieval History: In pre-Islamic times, the area that en compasses the present-day Republic of Yemen was called Arabia Felix\u2014happy or prosperous Arabia\u2014and was ruled by a number of indigenous dynasties in several different kingdoms. The most im portant cultural, social, and political event in Yemen's history was the coming of Islam around A.D. 630. Following the conversion of the Persian governor, many of the sheikhs and their tr ibes converted to Islam, and Yemen was ruled as part of Arab caliphates. The former North Yemen came under the control of imams of various dynasties, the most important of which were the Zaydis, whose dynasty lasted well into the twentieth century. 1 Library of Congress - Federal Research Division Country Profile: Yemen, August 2008 Former North Yemen: By the sixteenth century and again in the nineteenth century, northern Yemen was controlled in the cities by the Otto man Empire and in tribal areas by the Zaydi imam's suzerainty. The Ottoman Empire was disso lved in 1918, and Imam Yahya, leader of the Zaydi community, took power in the area that la ter became the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR), or North Yemen. Underground opposition to Yahya be gan in the late 1930s, and by the mid-1940s major elements of the population opposed his ru le. In 1948 Yahya was assassinated in a palace coup, and forces opposed to his feudal rule se ized power. His son Ahmad succeeded him and ruled until his own death in September 1962. Im am Ahmad's reign was marked by growing repression, renewed friction with the British over their presence in the south, and increasing pressure to support the Arab nationalist objectives of Egyptian Presiden t Gamal Abdul Nasser. From 1958 to 1961, North Yemen was federated with Egypt and Syria in the United Arab States. Imam Ahmad's son Badr assumed power after Ah mad's death but was deposed one week later by army officers, led by Colonel Abdallah al Sallal, who took control of Sanaa and created the YAR. Immediately upon taking power, the offi cers created the ruling eight-member Revolutionary Command Council headed by Sallal. Civil war ensued between the royalist forces, supported by Saudi Arabia and Jordan in opposition to the newly formed republic, and republicans, supported by Egyptian troops. In 1967 Egyptian troops were withdrawn, and by 1968, following a royalist siege of Sanaa, most of the opposing leaders had reconciled. In 1970 Saudi Arabia recognized the YAR. Former South Yemen: British influence increased in the southern and eastern portion of Yemen after the British captured the por t of Aden in 1839. It was ruled as part of British India until 1937, when Aden became a crown colony, and th e remaining territory was designated a protectorate (administered as the Eastern Protec torate and Western Protectorate). By 1965 most of the tribal states w ithin the protectorate and the Aden co lony itself had joined to form the British-sponsored Federation of South Arabia. Over the next two years, two rival factions\u2014the Marxist National Liberation Front (NLF) and the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen (FLOSY)\u2014fought for power. By August 1967, the NLF was in control of most areas, and at the end of the summer the federation formally collapsed. The last British troops were removed on November 29. On November 30, 1967, th e People's Republic of Yemen, comprising Aden and South Arabia, was proclaimed. In June 1969, a radical wing of the NLF gained power. The country's name changed to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) on December 1, 1970. Road to Unification: By 1972 the two Yemens were in open conflict. The YAR received aid from Saudi Arabia, and the PDRY received arms from the Soviet Union. Although the Arab League brokered a cease-fire and both sides ag reed to forge a united Yemen within 18 months, the two Yemens remained apart. The following years saw continued unrest and conflict, culminating in the assassinati on of the president of the YAR in June 1978. A month later, the Constituent People's Assembly elected Lieutenant Colonel Ali Abdallah Salih as president of the YAR. Renewed fighting broke out in early 1979, but in March the heads of state of the two Yemens signed an agreement in Kuwait pledging unification. In April 1980, Abdul Fattah Ismail, who had been appointed head of state of the PDRY in December 1978, resigned and went into exile. He was replaced by Ali Nasir Muhammad, a former prime minister. In January 1986, Ismail returned from exile and resumed a senior position 2 Library of Congress - Federal Research Division Country Profile: Yemen, August 2008 in the Yemen Socialist Party (YSP). More than a month of violence between Muhammad and Ismail's supporters resulted in Muhammad's ouste r and Ismail's death. In February 1986, former prime minister Haydar Abu Bakr al Attas wa s named president of a newly formed PDRY government. In October a general election took place in the PDRY for the na tional legislature. In the YAR's first general election, held in July 1988, President Salih won a third five-year term. In May 1988, the governments of the YAR and PD RY agreed to withdraw troops from their mutual border, create a demilitarized zone, and allo w easier border crossings for citizens of both states. In May 1990, they agreed on a draft unity constitution, which was ultimately approved by referendum in May 1991. The Republic of Ye men was officially declared on May 22, 1990. President Salih of the YAR became president of the new republic; Ali Salim al Baydh, secretary general of the Central Committee of the YSP wa s named vice president; a nd PDRY President al Attas was named prime minister. Al Attas led a tr ansitional coalition Council of Ministers whose membership was divided between the General People's Congress (GPC; the party supporting President Salih) and the Y SP (the party supporting Vice President al Baydh). Unrest and Civil War: In late 1991 through early 1992, dete riorating economic conditions led to significant domestic unrest, including several riots. Legislative elections were nonetheless held in early 1993, and in May the two former ruling parties, the GPC and the YSP, merged to create a single political party with an overall majority in the ne w House of Representatives. In August Vice President al Baydh exiled himself vo luntarily to Aden, and the country's general security situation deteriorated as political rivals settled scores and tribal elements took advantage of the widespread unrest. In January 1994, repres entatives of the main political parties signed a document of pledge and accord in Amman, Jord an, that was designed to resolve the ongoing crisis. But by May 1994, the country was in civil war, and international efforts to broker a cease- fire were unsuccessful. On May 21, 1994, al Baydh and other leaders of the former South Yemen declared secession and the establishment of a ne w Democratic Republic of Yemen centered in Aden, but the new republic failed to achieve any international recognition. On July 7, 1994, President Salih's troops captured Aden, thus endi ng the civil war. In August 1994, in an attempt to undermine the strength of southern military un its loyal to the YSP, Pr esident Salih prohibited party membership within the armed forces; he also introduced amendments to the constitution abolishing the Presidential Council and estab lishing universal suffrage. In October he was reelected president and named GPC members to key cabinet posts; several ministerial posts were given to members of the Yemeni Islah Party (YIP), which had been loyal to Salih during the civil war. 1994 to Present: Following the civil war, Yemen's currenc y, the riyal, was devalued; the cost of fuel doubled, water and electricity were in short supply, and food costs rose. Public demonstrations ensued, and the YIP was at odds with the GPC over economic reforms recommended by the World Bank. In the April 1 997 parliamentary elections, the GPC garnered 187 seats and the YIP only 53 seat s. A new Council of Minister s composed primarily of GPC members was named in May. The country contin ued to experience unrest due to economic hardship, coupled with increasi ng lawlessness, particularly ag ainst tourists. In September 1999, the first direct presidential election was held, r eelecting the incumbent, President Salih, to a five- year term by an overwhelming margin. Constitu tional amendments adopted in 2000 extended the president's term by two years. President Sali h was reelected in September 2006. In October 3 Library of Congress - Federal Research Division Country Profile: Yemen, August 2008 2007, he announced comprehensive political reforms, some of which will not take effect until he is no longer in power, calling in to question the prospects for implementation. The September 2006 elections for local and govern orate council seats, as well as the May 2008 elections for governorate governors have left power larg ely in the hands of the ruling GPC. GEOGRAPHY Location: Yemen is located in the Middle East at the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula between Oman and Saudi Arabia. It is situated at the entrance to the Bab el Mandeb strait, which links the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean (v ia the Gulf of Aden) and is Click to Enlarge Image one of the most active and strate gic shipping lanes in the world. Size: Yemen has an area of 527,970 square kilomete rs, including the islands of Perim at the southern end of the Red Sea and Socotra at the entrance to the Gulf of Aden. Land Boundaries: Yemen's land boundaries total 1,746 kilometers. Yemen borders Saudi Arabia to the north (1,458 kilometers) and Oman to the northeast (288 kilometers). Disputed Territory: A long-standing dispute between Saudi Arabia and Yemen was resolved in June 2000 with the signing of th e Treaty of Jiddah. This agreement provides coordinates for use in delineating the land and maritime border, includ ing the section in the eastern desert region of Yemen that potentially contains significant amounts of oil. Friction between the two countries in recent years over security of the borders appears to have been alleviated by the establishment of joint border patrols. However, in early 2008 Saudi Arabia reinforced its c oncrete-filled security barrier along sections of the border in order to stem illegal cross-border activities. Following years of dispute between Yemen and Erit rea over ownership of the Hanish Islands and fishing rights in the Red Sea, in 1999 an international arbitrat ion panel awarded sovereignty of the islands to Yemen. In 2002 Yemen established an economic and security link with Sudan and Ethiopia; because all thr ee countries have been involved in dis putes with Eritrea, the alliance has caused renewed tensions in the region. Length of Coastline: Yemen has 1,906 kilometers of coastl ine along the Arabian Sea, the Gulf of Aden, and the Red Sea. Maritime Claims: Yemen claims a territorial sea of 12 na utical miles, a contiguous zone of 24 nautical miles, an exclusive economic zone of 200 nautical miles, and a continental shelf of 200 nautical miles or to the edge of the continental margin. Topography: Yemen occupies the southern end of the Arabian Plateau. The country's mountainous interior is surrounded by narrow coasta l plains to the west, south, and east and by upland desert to the north along the border with Saudi Arabia. The Tihamah is a nearly 419\u00ad kilometer-long, semidesert coasta l plain that runs along the Red Sea. The interior mountains have elevations ranging from a few hundred meters to the country's highest point, Jabal an Nabi 4 Library of Congress - Federal Research Division Country Profile: Yemen, August 2008 Shuayb, which is 3,760 meters above sea level. The highland regions are interspersed with wadis, or river valleys, that are dry in the su mmer months. Most notable is the Wadi Hadhramaut in eastern Yemen, the upper portions of which c ontain alluvial soil and floodwaters and the lower portion of which is barren and largely uni nhabited. Both the eastern plateau region and the desert in the north are hot and dry with little vegetation. Principal Rivers: Yemen has no permanent rivers. Climate : Temperatures are generally very high in Yemen, particular ly in the coastal regions. Rainfall is limited, with variations based on el evation. The highlands en joy a temperate, rainy summer with an average high temperature of 21\u00b0 C and a cool, moderate ly dry winter with temperatures occasionally dipping below 4\u00b0 C. The climate of the Tiha mah (western coastal plain) is tropical; temperatures occasionally ex ceed 54\u00b0 C, and the humidity ranges from 50 to 70 percent. Rainfall, which comes in irregular h eavy torrents, averages 130 millimeters annually. In Aden the average temperature is 25\u00b0 C in Janua ry and 32\u00b0 C in June, but with highs often exceeding 37\u00b0 C. Average annual rainfall is 127 millimeters. The highest mountainous areas of southern Yemen receive from 520 to 760 millimeters of rain a year. It is not uncommon for the northern and eastern sections of the country to receive no rain fo r five years or more. The Wadi Hadhramaut in the eastern part of Yemen is arid and hot, and the humidity ranges from 35 percent in June to 64 percent in January. Natural Resources: Yemen's principal natural resources are oil and natural gas as well as agriculturally productive land in the west. Other natura l resources include fish and seafood, rock salt, marble, and minor deposits of coal, gold, lead, nickel, and copper. Land Use: Only 2.9 percent of Yemen is considered to be arable land, and less than 0.3 percent of the land is planted with permanent crops. A bout 5,500 square kilometers of land are irrigated. According to the United Nations, Yemen has 19, 550 square kilometers of forest and other wooded land, which constitutes almost 4 percent of total land area. Environmental Factors: Yemen is subject to sandstorms and dust storms, resulting in soil erosion and crop damage. The country has very limited natural freshwater and consequently inadequate supplies of potable water. Desertif ication (land degradati on caused by aridity) and overgrazing are also problems. Time Zone: Yemen is three hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time. SOCIETY Population: Yemen's latest census, conducted in December 2004, reported a population of 19.72 million persons, reflecting an average annual population growth rate of more than 3 percent. The U.S. government has estimated a population of 22.2 million persons as of July 2007, and the International Monetary Fund es timated almost 21 million persons in 2005. Yemen's population has more than doubled sinc e 1975 and has grown approximately 35 percent since the 1994 census, making Yemen the s econd most populous country on the Arabian 5 Library of Congress - Federal Research Division Country Profile: Yemen, August 2008 Peninsula. Adding to the growth of the native populati on is the influx of So mali refugees into Yemen\u2014tens of thousands every year. According to the United Nations Refugee Agency, there were almost 96,000 African refugees in Yemen in 2006, including more than 91,000 Somalis. The Yemen government estimated 300,000 Somalis in Yemen in 2007. According to the United Nations, Yemen's population in 2005 was 27.3 pe rcent urban and 73.7 pe rcent rural; was 40 persons per square kilometer. Demography: Yemen's population is predominantly young. According to U.S. government and United Nations estimates, in 2007 about 46 percent of the population was under age 15; slightly more than half the population, 15-64; and less than 3 percent, 65 and older. The population was almost equally divided between males and female s. In 2007 the birthrate and death rate were estimated to be 42.7 per 1,000 and 8.1 per 1,000, resp ectively. The infant mortality rate was almost 58 deaths per 1,000 live births. The rate wa s estimated to be higher for males than for females\u2014more than 62 male deaths per 1,000 live births, as compared with about 53 female deaths per 1,000 live births. Despite an increase of 14 years in the la st decade, life expectancy at birth in Yemen has remained low compared with other developing countries\u2014 60.6 years for males and 64.5 years for females, or 62.5 years over all. The country's fert ility rate was almost 6.5 children per woman in 2007. Ethnic Groups and Languages: Yemen's population is predom inantly Arab, but it also includes Afro-Arabs, South Asians, and Europeans. Arabic is the official language; English is also used in official and business circles. Religion: Virtually all of Yemen's citizens are Muslim s; approximately 30 percent belong to the Zaydi sect of Shia Islam, and about 70 percen t follow the Shafii school of Sunni Islam. A few thousand Ismaili Muslims, who adhere to Shia Islam, live in northern Yemen. Fewer than 500 Jews (a fraction of the former population) also live in the northern part of the country. Yemen's constitution declares that Islam is the state religion and that the president of the republic must \"practice his Islamic duties.\" The constitution also provides for freedom of religion, which the government generally respects but with limitations. The government prohibits the conversion and proselytizing of Muslims, requires permission for the construction of new places of worship, and permits non-Muslims to vote but not to hold elected office. Public schools provide instruction in Islam but not in other religions, although Muslim citizens are allowed to attend private schools that do not te ach Islam. In an effort to curb ideological and religious extremism in schools, the government does not pe rmit any courses outside of the officially approved curriculum to be taught in private a nd national schools. Because the government is concerned that unlicensed religi ous schools deviate from formal educational requirements and promote militant ideology, it has closed more than 4,500 of these institutions and deported foreign students studying there. The free practice of religion has met with some government opposition. In 2004 the government used military force to quell an armed insurgency led by a Shia cleric in the northern governorate of Sadah. In March 2007, the government abolishe d the al-Haq political party, whose members are linked to this insurgency m ovement, citing the party's failur e to meet political party law requirements. In early 2007, for the third y ear, the government banned the observance of a 6 Library of Congress - Federal Research Division Country Profile: Yemen, August 2008 religious holiday that is celebrated there by some Shia Muslim s and reportedly limited the hours that mosques were allowed to remain ope n, reassigned imams thought to espouse radical doctrine, and increased surveilla nce and detentio n of members of the in surgent group. According to the U.S. Department of State, Yemen's government, in an effort to curb extremism and increase tolerance, monitors mosques for in flammatory sermons and threatening political statements and uses police and intelligence ag encies to screen the activities of Islamic organizations tied to inte rnational organizations. Education and Literacy: According to composite data co mpiled by the World Bank, the adult literacy rate for Yemen in 2005 was 35 percent for females and 73 percent for males. The overall literacy rate for the population age 15 and olde r was 54 percent. By comparison, low-income countries in the aggregate average an adult literacy ra te of almost 62 percent. There is a direct correlation be tween the very high rate of i lliteracy and the lack of basic education. Although Yemen's laws provide for universal, compulsory, free education for children ages six through 15, the U.S. Department of State reports that co mpulsory attendance is not enforced, and the cost of attendance (appr oximately US$10 per student per year) is an additional deterrent. This deficiency is confirmed by World Bank statistics. In 2006 only 75 percent of Yemen's school-age population was enro lled in primary school; enrollment was even lower for the female population\u2014only 65 percent. In that same year, only 37 percent of the school-age population was enrolled in secondary school, including only 26 percent of eligible females. These low enrollment numbers are in turn a reflection of the countrywide shortage of the requisite infrastructure. School facilities and educational materials are of poor quality, classrooms are too few in number , and the teaching faculty is in adequate. In September 2004, the World Bank approved a US$121 million, six-year project to improve the quality of basic education (grades one through nine). Under this program, classroom facilities will be expanded and upgraded, curricula and educational material s improved, and the Ministry of Education's capacity to implement new programs and resources strengthened. In March 2008, the World Bank approved a US$103 million, seven-year project to improve gender equity, and the quality and efficiency of secondary education, focusing on girls in rural areas. This program, a major goal of which is to improve teaching and learning practices in the classroom, will upgrade school facilities and provide learni ng equipment as well as school community grants. Yemen's government has in recent years increased spending on education\u2014from 4.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1995 to 9.6 percent of GDP in 2005. Health: Despite the significant progress Yemen has ma de to expand and improve its health care system over the past decade, the system remain s severely underdeveloped. Total expenditures on health care in 2004 constituted 5 percent of gross domestic product. In that same year, the per capita expenditure for health care was very low compared with other Mi ddle Eastern countries\u2014 US$34 according to the World Health Organiza tion. According to the World Bank, the number of doctors in Yemen rose by an average of more than 7 percent between 1995 and 2000, but as of 2004 there were still only three doctors per 10,000 persons. In 2005 Yemen had only 6.1 hospital beds available per 10,000 persons. Health care services ar e particularly scarce in rural areas ; only 25 percent of rural areas are covered by health services, comp ared with 80 percent of urban areas. Emergency services, such 7 Library of Congress - Federal Research Division Country Profile: Yemen, August 2008 as ambulance service and blood banks, are non-ex istent. Most childhood deaths are caused by illnesses for which vaccines exist or that are ot herwise preventable. In 2003 an estimated 12,000 people in Yemen were living with human immun odeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), according to the Join t United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. Welfare: According to the United Nations, in 20 05 Yemen ranked 153 out of 177 countries on the human development index (HDI), a measure of life expectancy, education, and standard of living. Yemen had the lowest HDI ranking among th e Arab states. Several welfare programs are in place, but they generally have been consid ered inadequate to meet the needs of Yemen's impoverished citizens (estimated to exceed 45 per cent of the total population). The main social assistance program is the Social Welfare Fund, ini tially established to compensate for reductions in economic subsidies. In 2006 this program provided 1 million beneficiaries direct cash payments capped at US$10 per month and lump-sum payments for emergencies. In March 2008, the government announced it would double the amount of cash transfers unde r this program and also increase retiree monthl y pension benefits by US$7.50. The Social Fund for Development was established in 1997 with World Bank funds. Through its first and second phases, the fund has supported improved access of Yemen's poorest popul ation to basic social services, and more effective and efficient delivery of social services. Fo r the third phase, which is ongoing, the Bank provided US$60 million of International Develo pment Association credit and in June 2007 approved an additional US$15 million. The thre e main components of this project are community development, capacity-build ing, and micro-financing programs. ECONOMY Overview: At the time of unification, South Yemen and North Yemen had vastly different but equally struggling underdeveloped economic syst ems. Since unification, the economy has been forced to sustain the consequences of Yeme n's support for Iraq during the 1990-91 Gulf War: Saudi Arabia expelled almost 1 million Yemeni workers, an d both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait significantly reduced economic aid to Yeme n. The 1994 civil war furt her drained Yemen's economy. As a consequence, since 1995 Yemen has relied heavily on aid from multilateral agencies to sustain its economy. In return, it has pledged to impleme nt significant economic reforms. In 1997 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved two programs to increase Yemen's credit significantly: the enhanced struct ural adjustment facil ity (now known as the poverty reduction and growth facili ty, or PRGF) and the extended funding facility (EFF). In the ensuing years, Yemen's government attempted, with limited success, to implement recommended reforms\u2014reducing the civil service payroll, eliminating diesel and other subsidies, lowering defense spending, introducing a general sa les tax, and privatizing state-run industries. As a result, Yemen has received only a fraction of the aid initially allocated by bilateral and multilateral lenders. In late 2005, the World Bank, which, together wi th other lenders, had extended Yemen a four- year US$2.3 billion economic support packag e in October 2002, announced that, as a consequence of Yemen's failure to implement significant economic reforms and stem corruption, it would reduce financial aid by one-third, to US$280 million, over the period July 2005 through July 2008. Other funds pledged in the US$2.3 billi on package were withheld as well. However, 8 Library of Congress - Federal Research Division Country Profile: Yemen, August 2008 in May 2006 the World Bank adopted an assistance strategy for Yemen under which it will provide approximately US$400 million in Interna tional Development Association (IDA) credits over the period FY 2006 to FY 2009. In November 2006, Yemen's development partners pledged a total of US$5 billi on in grants and concessional loans for the period 2007-10 to finance projects outlined in Yemen's five-y ear (2006-10) Development Plan for Poverty Reduction (DPPR). Recognizing that the country's oil reserves ar e rapidly depleting, the DPPR focuses on the development of the country's non-oil resources: natural gas, agriculture, fisheries, transshipment, and tourism. At a February 2008 meeting, international lenders in the Yemen Consultative Group announced that as of D ecember 2007, 70 percent of the funds pledged (increased to US$5.3 billion) had been allocated. However, several attendees raised concerns about Yemen's lack of economic expansion, high population growth, worsening water crisis, and inability to contain security threats, all of which threaten to diminish the efficacy of international financial support. Yemen remains one of the poores t of the world's low-income countries; more than 45 percent of the po pulation lives in poverty. Gross Domestic Product (GDP): For 2006 Yemen's GDP was estimated to be US$19 billion. GDP per capita was estimated to be in a range of only US$880-US$904. World Bank and other economists have calculated a real growth rate of 3.2-4.0 percent in 2006, decreasing to a range of 2.8-3.6 percent in 2007, and estimate that real GDP growth in 2008 will remain unchanged. The general decline in th e GDP growth rate is attributed to decreased oil production, which has negatively affected exports of goods and services, coupled with increased demand for imports. In the period 2008-9, however, the financial support pledged by bilateral and multilateral donors in November 2006 and the construction of a liquefied natural gas plant (expected to begin exports in early 2009) should offset the anticipated sharp declin e in oil revenue, enabling GDP growth to remain constant. All of the rates estimated and forecast by economists fall far short of Yemen's five-year (2006-10) development plan, which ca lls for sustained average annual real GDP growth of 7 percent. The World Bank also has set a target of 7 percent GDP growth rate per year in order for Yemen to achieve sustained economic development. Government Budget: In 1995, in order to comply with condi tions stipulated by the International Monetary Fund, Yemen began an economic reform program, one component of which is fiscal policy reform aimed at reducing deficits a nd expanding the revenue base. However, the government has failed to significan tly reduce its primary expenditu re\u2014subsidies, es pecially the fuel subsidy. Fuel subsidies accounted for an estimated 8.7 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2007 and are forecast to rise to 11.8 pe rcent of GDP in 2008. Coupled with the fuel subsidy, the government has continued to raise ca pital spending and increase civil service wages and pension benefits. Defense spending remains high, and in late 2007 th e government adopted a supplementary US$1.3 billion budget to cover ri sing military costs stemming from internal security threats. Overall government spending is expected to increase by an annual average of approximately 14 percent in 2008-9. This trend ha s resulted in significan t fiscal deficits\u2014an estimated US$768 million in 2007 (3.7 percent of GDP) and US$1.2 billion in 2008 (4.9 percent of GDP); the deficit is forecas t to reach US$2.3 billion in 2009. Inflation: The implementation of economic reforms, including the cessation of Central Bank of Yemen financing of government budget deficits, reduced inflation from an average of 40 percent during the years immediately following unification (1990-96) to only 5.4 percent in 1997. High 9 Library of Congress - Federal Research Division Country Profile: Yemen, August 2008 oil prices and cuts in the fuel subsidy brought the rate of inflation back up to an average of 11.4 percent from 2001 to 2004 and to 11.8 percent in 2005. Despite efforts by the Central Bank to contain the effects of both addi tional reductions in government fu el subsidies and the imposition of a general sales tax in 2005, the average annual inflation rate was 20.8 percent in 2006. Although inflation slowed sharply in the first ha lf of 2007 as a result of lower prices for foodstuffs and intervention by the Central Bank, hi gher food prices in the latter part of 2007 pushed the annual average to 10 percent. Given increases in international non-oil commodity prices and strong domestic demand, economists projec t that the average inflation rate will reach 14.6 percent in 2008. Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing: Agriculture is the mainstay of Yemen's economy, generating more than 20 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) since 1990 (20.4 percent in 2005 according to the Central Bank of Yemen) a nd employing more than half (54.2 percent in 2003) of the working population. However, a U.S. government estimate suggests that the sector accounted for only 12.4 percent of GDP in 2007. Numerous environmental problems hamper growth in this sector\u2014soil erosion, sand dune en croachment, and deforestation\u2014but the greatest problem by far is the scarcity of water. As a result of low levels of rainfall, agriculture in Yemen relies heavily on the extraction of groundwater, a resource that is being depleted. Yemen's water tables are falling by approximately two meters a year. The use of irri gation has made fruit and vegetables Yemen's primary cash crops. With th e rise in the output of irrigated crops, the production of traditional rain-fed crops such as cereals has declined. A ccording to the Central Bank of Yemen, in 2005 the production of qat, a mild ly narcotic and heavily cultivated plant that produces natural stimulants when its leaves are chewed, rose 6.7 percent and accounted for 5.8 percent of GDP; its usage in Yemen is widesp read. According to the World Bank and other economists, cultivation of this plant plays a dominant role in Yemen's agricultural economy, constituting 10 percent of GDP and employing an estimated 150,000 persons while consuming an estimated 30 percent of irriga tion water and displacing land areas that could otherwise be used for exportable coffee, fruits, and vegetables. Although Yemen's extensive territorial waters and marine resources reportedly have the potential to produce 350,000-400,000 metric tons of fish each year, actual production is estimated to total only about 290,000 metric tons pe r year. The fishing industry is relatively underdeveloped and consists largel y of individual fishermen in sma ll boats. In recent years, the government has lifted restrictions on fish e xports, and production has increased, yielding revenues valued at US$256 million in 2005. Fish and fish products constitute only 1.7 percent of Yemen's GDP but are the second largest export. In December 2005, the World Bank approved a US$25 million credit for a six-year Fisheries Management and Conservation Project to be launched in all coastal governor ates along the Red Sea and the Gu lf of Aden. This project is expected to improve fish landing and auction facilities, provide i ce plants for fish preservation, and enable Yemen's Ministry of Fisheries to undertake more effective research, resource management planning, and regulatory activities. Mining and Minerals: Yemen is a small oil producer and does not belong to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Unlike many regiona l oil producers, Yemen relies heavily on foreign oil companies that have produ ction-sharing agreements with the government. Income from oil production constitutes 75 percen t of government revenue and about 85 percent 10 Library of Congress - Federal Research Division Country Profile: Yemen, August 2008 of exports. Yemen had proven crude oil reserves of more than 3 billi on barrels in 2007, down from 4 billion in 2006, and these reserves are not expected to last beyond 2020; in addition, output from the country's older fields is falli ng. According to statistics published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, crude oil ou tput averaged 380,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) in 2006, a reduction from 400,000 bbl/d in 2005. Crude o il output is projected to be 360,000 bbl/d in 2007 and to decrease to 350,000 bbl/d in 2008. According to the Oil and Gas Journal, Yemen had 16.9 trillion cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves in 2007. Of this amount, 9 trillion cubic feet have been designated for the export of liquefied natural gas (LNG) by Yemen LNG (YLNG), which was formed in 1997 between Yemen Gas Company and various privately held companies. In July 2005, following years of setbacks, the government gave final approval to three LNG supply agreements, enabling YLNG to award a US$2.6 billion contract to an international consortium to build the country's first liquefaction plant at Balhat on the Arabian Sea coas t. The plant is expected to deliver a total of 6.8 million tons of LNG per year ; initial shipments are expect ed by early 2009, two-thirds for export to the United States and the remainder to Asia. Industry and Manufacturing: The U.S. government estimates th at Yemen's industrial sector constituted 40.9 percent of gross domestic pr oduct (GDP) in 2007. Together with services, construction, and commerce, industry accounts for less than 25 percent of the labor force. The largest contributor to the manuf acturing sector's output is oil refining, which generates roughly 40 percent of total revenue. The remainder of this sector consists of the production of consumer goods and construction materials. Manufacturin g constituted approximately 9.9 percent of Yemen's GDP in 2006. Almost all (95 percent) of the establishments are small businesses (one to four employees). Almost half of all industrial establishments are involved in processing food products and beverages; the produc tion of flour and cooking oil has increased in recent years. Approximately 10 percent of the establishments are classified as manu facturing mixed metal products such as water-stor age tanks, doors, and windows. Energy: Yemen's state-owned Public Corporation for Electricity (PEC) operates an estimated 80 percent of the country's electricity generating capacity (1 gi gawatt) as well as the national power grid. Over the past 10 years, the government has considered various means of alleviating the country's significant electricity shortage, including restructuring the PEC, integrating the power sector through small-scale privat ization of power stations, crea ting independent power projects (IPPs), and introducing gas-genera ted power plants to free up oil supplies for export. In March 2005, Siemens signed a US$160 million contract to bu ild a 340-megawatt gas-fueled power plant at Marib, with the potential to generate 1,000 megawatts. In November 2007, the Saudi Arabian government agreed to provide a US$101 million grant for this project. In May 2006, the World Bank approved a US$50 million loan to help finance the five-year Power Sector Project, which is designed to relieve critical powe r-sector supply constraints, enhan ce electricity supp ly efficiency and quality, and improve the efficiency of th e PEC. In 2007 France's development financing agency, the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD), gave Yemen a US$37 million concessional loan to help build capacity in the electricity sector. In 2005 Yemen's diesel-run power plants generate d 4.1 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, a level of production that is insu fficient to maintain a consiste nt supply of electricity. Although 11 Library of Congress - Federal Research Division Country Profile: Yemen, August 2008 demand for electricity remains high, it is estimated that only 42 percent of the total population has access to electricity from the national power grid, and supply is intermittent, with frequent blackouts. To meet this demand, the government plans to increase the country's power generating capacity an additional 1,400 megawatts by 2010. Services: International economists have reported that Yemen's serv ices sector constituted 52.6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2004 and 53.1 percent of GDP in 2005. The U.S. government estimates that the services sector accounted for 46.7 percent of GDP in 2007. Banking and Finance: Yemen's financial services sector is underdeveloped and dominated by the banking system. Yemen has no public stock exchange, but the government wants to establish one by 2011. The banking system consists of the Central Bank of Yemen, 16 commercial banks (nine private domestic banks, four of which are Islamic banks; five priv ate foreign banks; and two state-owned banks), and two specialized st ate-owned development banks. The Central Bank of Yemen controls monetary policy and oversees the transfer of currencies abroad. It is the lender of last resort, exercises supervisory au thority over commercial banks, and serves as a banker to the government. The largest commerci al bank, the National Bank of Yemen, which is fully state-owned, and the Yemen Bank for Recons truction and Development, which is majority state-owned, are currently being restructured with the goal of eventual privatization. Because of fiscal difficulties in both ba nks, in 2004 Yemen's government approved a plan to merge them, but no action has been taken. The large volume of non-performing loans, lo w capitalization, and weak enforcement of regulatory standards hamper Yemen's banking sector as a whole. Numerous banks are technically insolvent. Because many debtors ar e in default, Yemen's banks limit their lending activities to a select group of consumers and businesses; as a re sult, the entire banking system holds less than 60 percent of the money suppl y. The bulk of the economy operates with cash. Legislation adopted in 2000 gave the Central Bank the authority to enforce tougher lending requirements, and in mid-2005 the Central Bank promulgated several new capital requirements for commercial banks aimed at curtailing curr ency speculation and protecting deposits. In 2007 Yemen's banking law was amended to ease entry c onditions for foreign banks and strengthen the oversight of Islamic banks. In March 2008, Yemen's parliament approved legislation establishing an independent depos it insurance agency to protect depositors with assets of US$10,000 or less. Tourism: Yemen's tourism industry is hampered by lim ited infrastructure as well as serious security concerns. The country's hotels and restau rants are below international standards, and air and road transportation is largely inadequate. Ki dnappings of foreign tourists remain a threat, especially outside the main ci ties, and, coupled with attacks on foreigners in 2007 and early 2008, present a significant deterrent to tourism. In April 2008, the U.S. Department of State reiterated previous warnings to U.S. citizens, urging them to defer non-essential travel to Yemen because the security threat level remains high. In March 2008, Britain's Foreign Office issued a similar advisory. Recent statistics for tourist arrivals in Yemen are not available, but in 2005 the number rose to 336,000 from 274,000 in 2004. 12 Library of Congress - Federal Research Division Country Profile: Yemen, August 2008 Labor: According to the U.S. government, the ag riculture and herding sector employs the majority of Yemen's working population (54.2 percen t in 2003). Industry, together with services, construction, and commerce, accoun ts for less than 25 percent of the labor force. The country's unemployment rate is estimated to be 35 percent. According to the World Bank and other economists , Yemen's civil service is characterized by a large, poorly paid workforce, multiple salary stru ctures, and an absence of effective enforcement measures to counter fraud. As the government ha s sought to appease discontent over a stagnant economy, civil service salaries have increa sed dramatically\u2014doubli ng between 2000 and 2005. The 2005 budget reduced economic subsidies but in exchange required the government to make various concessions, including in creasing civil service wages a nother 10 to 15 percent by 2007 as part of a national wage strategy. In 2006 the government provided across-the-board wa ge increases as the first phase of a four- phase Civil Service Moderniza tion Project. The second phase was implemented in November 2007, providing an average 20 percent salary incr ease for all public-secto r employees at an estimated cost of US$402 million. In March 2008, the government announced a US$15 per month increase in civil service and military pe rsonnel salaries. A major reform underway is the implementation of a biometric identification system for civilian and military personnel by September 2008; it is designed to eliminate the co llection of multiple salaries by one employee. The Ministry of Civil Services is also developing other proce dural reforms. The International Monetary Fund has stated that Yemen must reduce civil service salaries as a component of GDP, but this goal can be achieved only with continue d reductions in the size of the civil service. Foreign Economic Relations: During the 1990-91 Gulf War, Yemen supported Iraq in its invasion of Kuwait, thereby al ienating Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, both of which had provided critical financial assistance to Yemen. In additi on to withdrawing this ai d, Saudi Arabia expelled almost 1 million Yemeni workers. The resultant fa ll in expatriate remittances had a disastrous impact on Yemen's governmental budget. The ci vil war of 1994 further drained the economy, and in 1995 Yemen sought the aid of multilateral agencies. In 1996 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) granted Yemen a US$1 90 million stand-by credit facility, and the following year it approved two funding facilities that increased the country's credit by approximately US$500 million. However, the funding was contingent on Yemen's adoption of stringent economic reforms, a requirement that the country had limited success in fulfilling. As a result, the IMF suspended lending to Yemen from late 1999 until February 2001. In 2000 Kuwait and Saudi Arabia resumed financial aid to Yemen. In October 2002, bilateral and multilateral lender s led by the World Bank agreed to give Yemen a four-year economic support package worth US$2.3 b illion, 20 percent in grants and 80 percent in concessional loans. This funding is almost eight times the amount of financial support Yemen received from the IMF. However, in December 2005 the World Bank announced that because of the government's continued inability to effect si gnificant economic reforms and stem corruption, funding would be reduced by more than one-thi rd, from US$420 million to US$280 million for the period July 2005-July 2008. In May 2006, th e World Bank adopted a new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Yemen for the period FY 2006 to FY 2009, providing a blueprint for fostering the country's fiscal and human development improvement. The bank pledged to 13 Library of Congress - Federal Research Division Country Profile: Yemen, August 2008 contribute approximately US$400 million in In ternational Developmen t Association (IDA) credits over the CAS time frame. In December 2005, the Japanese government pledged to write off US$17 million of the US$264 Yemen owes. That same month, Germany pledged to increase its annual aid to Yemen to US$83.6 million over the next two years; funding will go primarily to education and water improvement projects. In November 2006, the United Kingdom announced that aid to Yemen would increase 400 percent, to US$222 million through 2011. In June 2008, the Yemeni General Investment Authority a nd the Chinese Council for the Promotion of International Trade jointly c onvened a symposium to advance the already strong trade and investment relationship between the two countries. During this meeting, China announced that it would provide a US$12 million grant to support development projects in Yemen. Yemen is a member of the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, which since 1974 has contributed to the financing of economic and social developmen t in Arab states and countries through loans and guarantees. In March 2004, th e Arab League provided US$136 million to Yemen to finance infrastructure improvements. At a mid-November 2006 meeting in London, a group of bilateral and multilateral donors ple dged US$5 billion over four years (2007-10) to fund economic development in Yemen. The goal of the meeting, which was jointly chaired by the World Bank and the government of Yemen, was to provide sufficient economic aid to Yemen to enable it to qualify for future Gulf Coope ration Council (GCC) membership. More than 55 percent of the aid, which is primarily in the fo rm of grants and has been increased to US$5.3 billion, will come from the GCC. In December 2007, the United Arab Emirates raised its pledge from US$500 million to US$650 million. Yemen was gr anted observer status at the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1999, and its application for full membership is currently under negotiation. Imports: Imports totaled US$4.7 billion in 2006, incr eased to an estimated US$6.7 billion in 2007, and are projected to increase to US$7.5 bill ion in 2008. This increase is due in part to Yemen's reliance on foreign capital goods for its ga s and infrastructure programs. Yemen is a net importer of all major categories of products excep t fuels. Principal imports are machinery and transport equipment, food and livestock, and processed materials. Th e principal source of Yemen's imports in 2006 was the United Arab Emir ates (15.8 percent of total imports); the bulk of these imports are actually re-exports from industrialized countries. Yemen received 12.3 percent of its total impor ts from China and 7.5 percent from Saudi Arabia. Exports: In 2006 Yemen's exports totaled US$7.3 billion. Crude o il is Yemen's main export, accounting for 85 percent of to tal exports in 2006. Yemen's non-oil exports are primarily agricultural products, mainly fish and fish products and coffee. In 2006 Asia remained the most important market for Yemen's exports, primarily China (29.9 percent of total exports), India, Thailand, and South Korea. Trade Balance: Yemen's import and export values have in creased and decreased dramatically in the past 10 years owing to shifts in global oil pr ices. As a result, the country's trade balance has fluctuated significantly from a deficit of al most US$800 million in 1998 to a surplus of US$1 billion in 2000. Rising oil prices resulted in a surplus of US $1.7 billion in 2005. The Central Bank of Yemen estimates that the trade surp lus reached US$2.6 billion (about 13.3 percent of gross domestic product) in 2006. 14 Library of Congress - Federal Research Division Country Profile: Yemen, August 2008 Balance of Payments: In recent years, Yemen's large non-mer chandise deficits have contributed to a decline in its current-acc ount position. Up until 2007, these deficits were offset by record export earnings, which resulted in large enough trade surpluses to keep the current account in surplus\u2014US$633.2 million in 2005 and US$1.8 billi on in 2006. In 2007, however, the rise in import spending resulted in an estimated current -account deficit of US$519 million, the first such deficit for Yemen since 1998. This deficit is pr ojected to increase to US$660 million in 2008. External Debt: In 1990 the newly unified Republic of Ye men inherited an unsustainable debt burden amounting to roughly 106 percent of gro ss domestic product. Debt rescheduling by the Paris Club creditor countries in the 1990s, coupled with a ssistance from the World Bank's International Development Agency, resulted in a drop in Yemen's debt stock to US$5.4 billion in 2006. According to the Central Bank of Yemen, Yemen's debt stock was US$5.8 billion (more than 25 percent of gross domestic product) by year-end 2007. According to the U.S. government, Yemen's reserves of foreign exchan ge and gold were US$7.9 billion in 2007. Foreign Investment: Yemen does not have a stock exchange, therefore limiting inward portfolio investment. Portfolio investment abroad is also very limited, with the result that portfolio flows are largely unrecorded by authorities. In the earl y 1990s, net direct investment was at its peak as foreign investors tapped Yemeni oil reserves, bu t since 1995 net direct in vestment flows have been negative because cost recovery for foreign oil companies has exceeded new direct investment. A US$3 billion liquid natural gas (L NG) construction project involving a consortium of foreign companies is underway following gov ernment approval in August 2005, with initial exports expected in early 2009. Such a project raises the prospect of increased foreign investment in the future as LNG facilities are built. Currency and Exchange Rate: Yemen's currency is the Yemeni riyal (YR), which was floated on the open market in July 1996. Periodic interv ention by the Central Bank of Yemen enabled the riyal to gradually depreciate approximately 4.2 percent per year from 1999 to 2003, and in varying amounts in subsequent years. However, in light of the weakening U.S. dollar, and in an effort to stem inflation, in 2007 the Central Ba nk of Yemen halted the riyal's depreciation. Its value averaged YR191.5 per US$1 in 2005, YR197 per US$1 in 2006, and YR 199 per US$1 in 2007. The exchange rate is expected to continue to average YR 199 per US$1 in 2008. In mid- August 2008, the exchange rate was nearly YR 200 per US$1. (EIU 2007, April 2008; Central Bank of Yemen)) Fiscal Year: Yemen's fiscal year coincides with the calendar year. TRANSPORTATION AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS Overview: As a direct consequence of its poverty, Ye men compares unfavorably with its Middle Eastern neighbors in terms of transportation in frastructure and communications network. Roads are generally poor, but several projects are pl anned to upgrade the system. Although there is no rail network, a rail line linking Yemen w ith Oman is under consideration by the Gulf Cooperation Council. Efforts to upgrade airport f acilities have languished, and telephone and Internet usage and capabilities are limited. The port of Aden has shown a promising recovery 15 Library of Congress - Federal Research Division Country Profile: Yemen, August 2008 from a 2002 attack; container th roughput increased significantly in 2006 and set a record level in 2007. However, the agreement to turn over long-te rm management of the port's main facility, Aden Container Terminal, to DP World has b ecome controversial and is not yet finalized. Roads: Relative to Yemen's size, the road trans portation system is very limited. Yemen has 71,300 kilometers of roads, only 6,200 kilometers of which are paved. In the north, roads connecting Sanaa, Taizz, and Al Hudaydah are g ood, as are intercity bus services. In the south, roads are generally poor and in need of repair , except for the Aden-Tai zz road. In November 2005, the World Bank approved a five-year, almost US$50 million project to upgrade approximately 200 kilometers of intermediate rural roads and approximately 75 kilometers of village access roads as part of a larger effort to strengthen Yemen's capability for rural road planning and engineering. Plans are well advanced to build an estimated US$1.6 billion highway linking Aden in the south and Amran in the nort h. The road will include more than 10 tunnels and halve the travel time between the southe rn seacoast and the northern border with Saudi Arabia. Railroads: Yemen has no rail network, but a regional rail network planned by the Gulf Cooperation Council states is expected to in clude a 1,000-kilometer ra il line linking Muscat, Oman, with the eastern Yemeni border outpost Shihen (also seen as Shahan). Under the supervision of the World Bank, three international consultancies ha ve been preparing feasibility studies for this project sin ce September 2007; their findings are expected by the end of 2008. Ports: Yemen's main ports are Aden, Al Hudaydah, Al Mukalla, and Mocha; Aden is the primary port. In addition, Ras Isa serves as th e loading point for oil exports, and a small amount of cargo passes through Nishtun. Facilities at Aden consist of the Maalla Terminal and the Ad en Container Terminal (ACT), which opened in March 1999. The port can handle ro ll-on-roll-off and contai ner cargoes, as well as tankers. In November 2003, following the Oct ober 2002 bombing of the French supertanker Limburg off the Yemen coast and the resultant dramatic drop in throughput at the Aden port, the Port of Singapore Authority sold its majority st ake in the ACT back to the Yemeni government. In June 2005, Dubai Ports International (later re named DP World) was se lected to upgrade and operate the ACT under a 35-year contract, but Yeme n's parliament refused to approve the deal. Acknowledging both the wealth of DP World and the United Ar ab Emirates' strong economic support, in 2007 the Yemeni government resumed contract negotiations w ith DP World. Pending agreement on a final contract, which remains un certain, Aden Gulf Seaports Corporation, a government entity, is managing the port. The port of Aden has recovered well from the 2002 bombing. In 2005 the port handled 317,897 twenty-f oot-equivalent units ( TEUs) of containers, slightly more than double the amount for 2003. The port handled 397,080 TEUs of containers in 2006 and a record 503,325 TEUs of containers in 2007. Inland Waterways: Yemen has no waterways of any significant length. Civil Aviation and Airports: Yemen has 50 airports, 17 of which have paved runways. Of the 50 airports, four are in ternational\u2014Aden International, Sanaa International, Taizz, and Al Hudaydah. A major reconstruction and expansion of Aden International was completed in 2001, including a new runway that can handle large, lo ng-haul aircraft. Plans to make that airport a 16 Library of Congress - Federal Research Division Country Profile: Yemen, August 2008 regional cargo hub, with an \"air cargo vill age,\" by 2004 have all but failed. Although construction began in January 2003, by year's end the managing company had dissolved. In December 2006, the chairman of the Aden Fr ee Zone announced that US$250 million of funds allocated to Yemen at the November London donor s' conference would be directed to this project. Yemenia is the national airline; it absorbed th e former national carrier of South Yemen in 1996. It is expected that Yemenia, which is curren tly 49 percent owned by the Saudi government and 51 percent by the Yemen government, will eventually be privatized, but there has been resistance from the Saudis. In 2001 the airline carried 858,000 passengers. Because the airline's existing fleet of 12 aircraft is rapidly becoming outdated, in 2002 three new aircraft were leased for eight years, and in early 2006 the airlin e announced plans to acquire six new aircraft, with options for an additional four, beginning in 2012. In May 2006, the company allocated US$2 million for upgrades, including electronic ti cketing and reservations. Pipelines: According to the U.S. government, as of 2007 Yemen had a total of 1,402 kilometers of pipelines. This total includes pipeline designed for gas (71 kilometers ), liquid petroleum gas (22 kilometers), and oil (1,309 kilometers). Telecommunications: TeleYemen is the exclusive provider of international telecommunications for Yemen\u2014fixed-line, telex, and Internet serv ices\u2014and is one of the mobile-phone operators. In 2003 the government-owned Public Telecommuni cations Corporation a ssumed full control of TeleYemen, and a year later it awarded a five-year management contract to France Telecom. According to the U.S. government, Yemen had only 270,000 Internet users in 2006. This low number is attributed to the hi gh cost of computer equipment and connections in combination with the population's low level of income, as well as to th e restricted bandwidth available on Yemen's outdated telephone network. In 2005 Te leYemen announced it would invest in the FALCON high-capacity loop cable system, which will improve Internet access, including broadband capability, and also expand international call accessibility. The cost of running a landline or owning a mobile telephone is out of reach for most of Yemen's poor population, resulting in very low telephone usage rates\u20143.9 fixed-line subscribers and 9.5 mobile subscribers per 100 persons in 2005. The U.S. government reported 968,400 landlines and 2 million mobile subscribers in Yemen in 2006. The technology used for domestic lines includes microwave radio relay, cable, and Globa l System for Mobile Communications (GSM). In 2001 two private companies won 15-year licen ses to provide mobile phone services. The growth of the companies' networks has resu lted in coverage of about 60 percent of the population, but threats to internal security coupled with poor consumer payment history remain obstacles to future growth. In August 2005, the gove rnment awarded a contract to a joint venture between China Mobile and a group of Yemeni inve stors to take a 55 percent stake in Yemen's third mobile network; the government will reta in a 25 percent share. In August 2006, the same conglomerate was awarded a contract for a fourth mobile network. The state-run Republic of Yemen Television and Republic of Yemen Radio operate the country's television and radio networks, respectively. According to th e U.S. government, as of 1998 17 Library of Congress - Federal Research Division Country Profile: Yemen, August 2008 Yemen had six AM, one FM, and two shortwave ra dio broadcast stations and, as of 2007, three television broadcast stations, plus several low-power repeaters. GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS Political System/Overview: Since unification in 1990, Yemen ha s officially been a republic. According to the constitution, \"the political system of the Republic of Yemen is based on political and partisan pluralism.\" In reality, however, the General People's Congress (GPC), which is headed by President Ali Abdallah Salih (who won re-election in September 2006 with 77 percent of the vote), dominates the government a nd continues to hold an absolute majority in parliament as a result of the 2003 elections. In 2001 several constitutional amendments, passed by national referendum, strengthen ed the powers of th e executive branch. The president was given the authority to dissolve parliament without a national re ferendum, and his term of office was extended to seven years. The Shura Council appointed by the president was almost doubled in size and given enhanced legislative authorit y. Yemen's judiciary is perceived as weak and corrupt, and numerous government efforts to effect reform have as yet failed to improve the functioning of the judicial system . In April 2007, a presidential d ecree was issued declaring the appointment of a new prime minister and Council of Ministers. The ministerial changes were made in response to concerns about Yemen's d eclining economy and allegations of corruption. In October 2007, President Salih announced severa l constitutional reform measures designed to democratize Yemen's political system and empower local authorities, but the prospect for their implementation remains uncertain. Constitution: Yemen's constitution was ratified by popular referendum on May 16, 1991. It defines the republic as an inde pendent and sovereign Arab and Islamic country and establishes sharia, or Islamic law, as the basis of all la ws. In February 2001, several amendments were passed by national referendum extending the pres idential term to seven years and the parliamentary term to six years and increasing the size and authority of the Shura Council. Branches of Government: Yemen's current president, Ali Abdallah Salih, was reelected by universal suffrage in September 2006 for a seven-y ear term. He won the election with 77 percent of the vote, despite a challe nge from the opposition Joint Meeting Parties (JMP) coalition candidate, Faisal bin Shamlan. The president appo ints a vice president and a prime minister, who in turn appoints the 35-member Council of Ministers. Yemen's legislature is bicameral, composed of an elected 301-seat House of Repres entatives (parliament) and an appointed Shura Council with 111 members. The parliament, whose members serve six-year terms, enacts laws, sanctions general state policy and the socioe conomic plan, and approves government budgets and final accounts. The current parliament is do minated by the ruling party, the General People's Congress; as a result, it has failed to initiat e legislation, instead de bating policies that the government submits, and is generally perceived as an ineffective check on executive-branch authority. Pursuant to 2001 c onstitutional amendments, the S hura Council, whose role is primarily advisory, has the power to vote jointly with parliament on any legislative matters of the president's choice. 18 Library of Congress - Federal Research Division Country Profile: Yemen, August 2008 Yemen has six types of courts: criminal, civil, personal status , special cases (e.g., kidnaping, carjacking, and acts of sabotage), co mmercial, and court-martial. In recent years, other limited- jurisdiction courts, e.g., juvenile and public funds courts, have b een established under executive authority. The judicial system is organized in a three-tiered court structure. At the base are the courts of first instance, with broad powers to he ar all manner of civil, criminal, commercial, and family matters. At the next leve l are the courts of appeal, one in each governorate and one in Sanaa. Each court of appeal has separate divisions for criminal, military, civil, and family issues. The highest court, the Supreme C ourt, settles jurisdictional disput es between courts, hears cases brought against high government officials, serves as the final court of appe al for all lower court decisions, and determines the constitutionality of laws and regulations. In addition to this formal court system, there is a system of tribal adjudi cation. It is responsible primarily for non-criminal issues, but in practice these courts adjudicate criminal cases as well. Administrative Divisions: Yemen is divided into 19 governorates. According to the U.S. government, for electoral and administrative purposes the capital city of Sa naa is treated as an additional governorate. A Unite d Nations report on the preliminary results of Yemen's 2004 population census also lists Ra imah as a new governorate. Provincial and Local Government: Formal government authority is centralized in the capital city of Sanaa. Yemen's Local Authority Law decentralized authority by establishing locally elected district and governorate councils (last elected in September 2006), formerly headed by government-appointed governors. After the September 2006 local and governorate council elections, President Salih announced various measures that would enable future governors and directors of the councils to be directly electe d. In May 2008, governors were elected for the first time. However, because the ruling party, the Ge neral People's Congress (GPC), continues to dominate the local and governorate councils, the May 2008 elections retained this party's executive authority over the govern orates. In rural Yemen, direct state control is weak, with tribal confederations acting as autonomous sub-states. Judicial and Legal System: Yemen's constitution, as amended, stipulates that Islamic law (sharia) is the source of all le gislation. All laws are based on a combination of sharia, old Egyptian laws, and Napoleonic tr adition. Defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty; indigent defendants in felony cases are by law entitled to counsel, but in practice this does not always occur. Trials, which are generally public , are conducted without ju ries; judges adjudicate criminal cases. All defendants have the right of appeal. Women often suffer discrimination, particularly in domestic matters. Although Yemen's constitution provides for an aut onomous judiciary and independent judges, in reality the judiciary is managed by an executive -branch council, the S upreme Judicial Council (SJC), and judges are appointed and can be removed by the executive branch. The judicial system itself is considered weak; corruption is widespread; the government is often reluctant to enforce judgments; and judges are subject to ha rassment from tribal l eaders, who themselves exercise significant discretion in the interpretati on and application of the law. There have been several restructurings of the judi ciary since the government initiate d a judicial reform program in 1997, but none have resulted in any significant impr ovements in the functioning of the system or produced evidence of having reduced corruption. 19 Library of Congress - Federal Research Division Country Profile: Yemen, August 2008 Electoral System: Yemen has universal suffrage for those age 18 and older. The constitution provides that the president be elected by popular vote from at l east two candidates endorsed by parliament. In 1999 the first nationwide direct presidential electi on was held, giving Ali Abdallah Salih, the leader of th e General People's C ongress (GPC), a five-year term, which was extended to seven years in 2001. President Sa lih was reelected in September 2006 with 77 percent of the popular vote. The electorate also elects the parlia ment every six years, most recently in April 2003. The next parliamentary elections are to be held in April 2009. Although the various 2006 elections (preside ntial and local) were deemed by international observers to be generally open and competitive, there were re ports of irregularities, such as underage and duplicate voting and the use of state funds to support GPC candidates. Politics and Political Parties: Yemen's Political Parties Law mandates that political parties be viable national organizations comprising at l east 75 founders and 2,500 members and not restrict membership to a particular region. The government provides financia l support to political parties, including a stipend for newspaper publ ication. The ruling part y, the General People's Congress (GPC), captured 238 of 301 seats in parl iament in the 2003 elections. In the September 2006 elections for local and governorate counc ils, the GPC garnered 315 seats in the governorates (74 percent of th e popular vote) and 5,078 local counc il seats (74 pe rcent of the popular vote). In 2005 a coalition of five opposition parties form ed the Joint Meeting Parties (JMP) to effect political and economic reform. The JMP includes the northern-based, tribal, and Islamist-oriented Yemeni Congregation for Refo rm (Islah) and the secular Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP), which represents the remnants of the former South Yemeni leadership. In the September 2006 presidential election, the JMP b acked opposition candidate Faisal bin Shamlan, whose success in garnering 22 percen t of the popular vote was viewed at the time as a first step in challenging the political str onghold of President Salih and the GPC. However, disputes between the GPC and the JMP in 2007 over elec tion law amendments, coupled with the JMP's opposition to President Salih's proposed democratic reform measures, have halted initial attempts to forge a dialogue between the two parties. Mass Media: Yemen's Ministry of Information infl uences the media through its control of printing presses, granting of newspaper subsidies, and ownership of the co untry's only television and radio stations. According to the U.S. Depa rtment of State, Yemen has nine government- controlled, 50 independent, and 30 party-affilia ted newspapers. There are approximately 90 magazines, 50 percent of which are private, 30 percent government-controlled, and 20 percent party-affiliated. The government controls the content of news broadcasts and rarely permits antigovernment material to be aired. Although Yemen's government claims it does not monitor Internet usage, the U.S. Department of State reports that the government does occasionally block political and religious Web sites. By law and regulation, newspapers and magazines must be government-licensed, and their content is restricted. There have been reports of journalists being physically attacked, as well as arrested and detained. Foreign Relations: The 1990-91 Gulf War had a significan t negative impact on Yemen's relations with its Arab neighbors. As a member of the United Nations Security Council during those years, Yemen abstained on a number of Security Council re solutions concerning Iraq and Kuwait, did not support economic sanctions against Iraq, and called for an \"Arab solution\" to the crisis. Western and neighboring Gulf states responded by curtailing or canceling aid programs and diplomatic contacts. In part icular, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait cu t off critical financial aid and 20 Library of Congress - Federal Research Division Country Profile: Yemen, August 2008 budgetary support, and Saudi Arabia expelled almost 1 million Yemeni workers, all of which had a profound impact on Yemen's government finances . Yemen did not succeed in re-establishing diplomatic ties with Kuwait until 1999; in 2000, when a border agreement was signed with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait agreed to resume financial ai d. The treaty Yemen signed with Saudi Arabia resolved a 50-year-old dispute between the two countries, providing coordinates for delineating the land and maritime border. In 1995 Yemen and Oman finalized the demarcation of their common border and currently have a strong trad e relationship. Yemen's long-term goal is membership in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) , and its foreign policy is largely driven by its desire to secure the financ ial support of GCC memb er states. At a meeting of international donors in November 2006, the largest block of aid to Yemen, US$1 billion, was pledged by Saudi Arabia. Although relations with the West were strained as a result of Yemen's pro-Iraq stance during the first Gulf War, ties were re-established by th e mid-1990s when Western democracies urged the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank to extend financial assistance to Yemen. In 1999 the United States began using Aden as a refueling stop for the U.S. Navy. After the October 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in that harbor, Yemen stre ngthened its efforts against the Islamist groups responsible for the attac k. In July 2001, the United States renewed the bilateral financial aid that had been frozen since the Gu lf War. Since September 11, 2001, relations between Yemen and the United States ar e considered to be significantly stronger. Yemen reportedly values the military and financial support the United States provides, as well as its influence with the IMF, which has serious concerns about Yemen's commitment to economic reform. According to the U.S. Department of Stat e, as of late 2007 the United States considered Yemen an important partner in the global war on terrorism, providing assistance in the military, diplomatic, and financial arenas. The U.S. gove rnment reaffirmed its commitment to provide economic and military support to Yemen dur ing November 2005 and May 2007 meetings between the White House and President Sali h. However, in April 2008 the United States embassy in Sanaa was the potential target of a mortar attack. This incident, coupled with Yemen's refusal to extradite two al Qaeda suspects convicted in Yemen of terrorist attacks, has strained relations between Yemen and the United States. Membership in International Organizations: Yemen is a member of the United Nations (UN) and many of its affiliates and specialized agencies: Food and Agriculture Organization, International Civil Aviation Or ganization, Internati onal Fund for Agricult ural Development, International Labour Organization, International Maritime Organi zation, International Telecommunication Union, UN Conference on Trade and Development, UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, UN Industrial Development Organization, Universal Postal Un ion, and World Health Organization. Yemen is also a member of the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, Arab Monetary Fund, Council of Arab Economic Unity, Group of 77, International Atomic Energy Agency, International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, International Civil Aviation Organization, Internat ional Confederation of Free Trade Un ions, International Criminal Court (signatory), International Criminal Police Orga nization, International Fe deration of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, International Finance Corporation, Intern ational Monetary Fund, Islamic Development Bank, League of Arab St ates, Multilateral Investment Guarantee Investment Agency, Organisation for the Prohib ition of Chemical Weapons, Organization of the 21 Library of Congress - Federal Research Division Country Profile: Yemen, August 2008 Islamic Conference, World Intellectual Prope rty Organization, and Wo rld Meteorological Organization. Yemen was granted observer status at the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1999 and in 2002 and 2003 submitted necessary documentation for full membership. The WTO working party on Yemen met in 2004 and twice thereafter to discuss Yemen's accession; negotiations are expected to take several years. Major International Treaties: Yemen is a signatory to various international agreements on agricultural commodities, commerce, defense, ec onomic and technical cooperation, finance, and postal matters. Yemen is a Non-Annex I c ountry under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Yemen is not a signa tory to the Kyoto Protocol but has acceded to it, which has the same legal effect as rati fication. Yemen is a signatory to the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty, a party to the Biological Weapons Conventi on, and has signed and ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention. Yemen is al so a party to environmental conventions on Biodiversity, Desertification, Environmental Mo dification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, and Ozone Layer Protection. NATIONAL SECURITY Armed Forces Overview: The armed forces of the Yemen Arab Republic and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen were officially merged in May 1990, but in May 1994 civil war broke out between the forces of the two former states, culminati ng in victory for the North. In October 1994, President A li Abdallah Salih announced plans for the modernization of the armed forces, which would include the banning of party affiliation in the security services and armed forces, and in March 1995 the full merger of the armed forces was completed. The number of military personnel in Yemen is relatively high; in sum, Yemen has the second largest military force on the Arabian Peninsula af ter Saudi Arabia. Yemen's military consists of an army, navy, air force, and reserves. In 2007 to tal active troops were estimated as follows: army, 60,000; navy, 1,700; and air force, 5,000. In September 2007, the government announced the reinstatement of compulsory military service. Yemen's defense budget, which in 2006 represented approximately 40 percent of the total government budget, is expected to remain high for the near term, as the military draft takes effect and in ternal security threats continue to escalate. Despite these troop levels, Yemen's military equipment is considered to be light, outdated, and poorly maintained, particularly when compared with neighboring Gulf states. Foreign Military Relations: Although no U.S. troops are based permanently in Yemen, the United States has provided military assistance and technical support in recent years. According to the U.S. Department of State, the resumption of International Military Education and Training (IMET) assistance and the transfer of military equipment and spare parts to Yemen have improved defense relations between the United St ates and Yemen. In FY 2006, Foreign Military Financing for Yemen was US$8.4 million, IMET was US$924,000, and Non-Proliferation, Anti- Terrorism, Demining and Related Programs received US$1.4 million. Nongovernment sources report that in addition to this aid, U.S. milita ry advisers have trained Yemeni troops in counterterrorism techniques, and the United States has contributed to Yemen's border security by installing advanced technologi cal immigration control systems. In an effort to bolster Yemen's maritime security and establish a coast guard capable of stemming terrorist activities, 22 Library of Congress - Federal Research Division Country Profile: Yemen, August 2008 the United States has sent naval experts to train the new Yemeni coast guard and in 2004-5 donated 14 patrol craft to the coast guard. In 200 5 an Australian company delivered 10 patrol boats to assist Yemeni government efforts to combat terrorism and illegal trafficking; the company will train crews to man the vessels. External Threat: In the aftermath of the 1990-91 Gulf War when Yemen sided with Iraq in its invasion of Kuwait, both Kuwait and Saudi Arab ia broke diplomatic ties with Yemen. Although these ties have been restored, tensions remain over the Saudi Arabia-Yemen border; in early 2008, Saudi Arabia reinforced its concrete-filled s ecurity barrier along sections of the border in order to stem illegal cross-border activities. Desp ite increased border security, fugitive Islamist militants from throughout the Gulf region, especially Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, and Iraq, regularly cross what is still perceived as a lax bo rder into Yemen. This poses a security threat to a country battling terro rism on many fronts. Defense Budget: Yemen's defense spending has historical ly been one of the government's three largest expenditures and is expected to remain high as a result of the reinstatement of conscription and security threats posed by terro rism and tribal conflict. The defense budget increased from US$540 million in 2001 to and estimated US$823 million-US$1.1 billion in 2006. According to the U.S. government, the 2006 budget represents about 6 percent of gross domestic product. Major Military Units: Yemen's military is divided into an army, navy, and air force. The army is organized into eight armored brigades, 16 in fantry brigades, six mechanized brigades, two airborne commando brigades, one surface-to-surface mi ssile brigade, three ar tillery brigades, one central guard force, one Special Forces brigade, and six air defense brig ades, which consist of four antiaircraft artillery battalions and one su rface-to-air missile ba ttalion. The navy's major bases are located in Aden and Al Hudaydah; th ere are also bases in Al Mukalla, Perim Island, and Socotra that maintain naval support equipmen t. The air force includes an air defense force. Major Military Equipment: Yemen's army is reported to be equipped with 790 main battle tanks, 130 reconnaissance vehicles, 200 armore d infantry fighting vehicles, 710 armored personnel carriers, 310 towed arti llery, 25 self-propelled artiller y, 294 multiple rocket launchers, 502 mortars, six Scud B (up to an estimated 33 missiles) and 28 othe r surface-to-surface missiles, 71 antitank guided weapons, some rocket launchers, some reco illess launchers, 530 air defense guns, and an estimated 800 surface-to-air missiles. The navy's inventory includes eight missile craft, six miscellaneous boats/craft, five inshore patrol craft, six mine countermeasures vessels, one landing ship (tank), two landing craft (mechanical), f our landing craf t (utility), and two support and miscellaneous tankers. The air fo rce, including air defense, has 75 combat aircraft and eight attack helicopters, as well as assorted tran sport aircraft, trai ning aircraft and helicopters, and both air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles. Military Service: In 2001 Yemen's National Defense Counc il abolished the existing two-year compulsory military service, relying instead on volunteers to fill posts in the military and security forces. In 2007 the government announced it would reinstate th e draft to counter unemployment; approximately 70,000 new recruits are expected to join the military. 23 Library of Congress - Federal Research Division Country Profile: Yemen, August 2008 Paramilitary Forces: Yemen's paramilitary force has about 71,000 troops. Approximately 50,000 constitute the Central Security Organization of the Ministry of Interior; they are equipped with a range of infantry weapons and armored personnel carriers. An additional 20,000 are forces of armed tribal levies. Yemen is building up a sm all coast guard under the Ministry of Interior, training naval military technicians for posts in Ad en and Al Mukalla. The coast guard currently has 1,200 personnel. Foreign Military Forces: There are no permanent U.S. troops in Yemen, but military personnel have been deployed there in recent years for training purposes. Since the February 2006 escape of 23 Al Qaeda members from a prison in Sanaa, an international coa lition of warships has patrolled the waterways off Yemen. Military Forces Abroad: Yemen's Middle Eastern neighbors who are members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) participate in a defense force based in Saudi Arabia. Yemen is not a member of the GCC, and there are no reports of the country having a military presence outside of its own borders. Police: Yemen's primary and most feared internal security and intelligence-gathering force is the Political Security Organization (PSO), led by military officers; it reports directly to the president and operates its own detention centers. Ther e are an estimated 150,000 personnel in the PSO. The Central Security Organization, which is part of the Ministry of Interior, maintains a paramilitary force and also has its own extrajudic ial detention facilities. Also attached to the Ministry of Interior is the Criminal Investiga tive Department (CID) of the police, which conducts most criminal investigations and arrests. The total strength of the CID is estimated to be 13,000 personnel. According to the U.S. Department of State, members of the PSO and Ministry of Interior police forces have committed serious human rights violations, including physical abuse and lengthy detentions without formal charges. In 2002 the government established the National Security Bureau, which reports directly to the president and appears to have similar responsibilities to those of the PSO, but it remains unclear ho w the two organizations coordinate their responsibilities. Internal Threat: Analysts see the greatest challenge to the political domina nce of the General People's Congress as stemming from a range of security threats posed by Islamist and tribal elements within Yemen. Yemen's topography contribu tes to a lack of centr al government control in the more remote governorates, which in turn ha s enhanced the authority of the country's well- armed autonomous tribes. Tribesmen routinely kidnap foreign tourists an d workers in order to extract political and economic concessions from the government; as recently as May 2008, two Japanese tourists were kidnapped in Marib. In northern Yemen, since 2005 al-Houthi rebels have carried out att acks against police and soldiers near Sadah; the attackers are believed to be followers of a militant Zaydi cleric killed by Yemeni security forces in September 2004. Desp ite the negotiation of cease-fires in March 2006, June 2007, and February 2008, thousands have been killed, and fighting continues. Several bombings were reported in May 2008. Since May 2007, in Aden and other southern governorate cities, security forces have battled demons trations by former army officers, demanding reinstatement and better pensions , as well as unemployed workers. In 2008 these protests have 24 Library of Congress - Federal Research Division Country Profile: Yemen, August 2008 grown in number and intensity. The government al so faces a threat from militants from Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, and Iraq who routinely cro ss the Yemen-Saudi Arabia border, as well as militant Islamists from Somalia who can access ex isting arms smuggling routes between the two countries. Terrorism: Yemen was the site of two major terr orist attacks\u2014the suicide bombing attack against the USS Cole in October 2000 in the Aden har bor and the bombing of the French supertanker Limburg off the port of Al Mukalla two year s later. In 2004 suspects linked to al Qaeda were prosecuted and convicted in Yemeni courts for the Aden attacks as well as other planned terrorist activities. In 2005 dozens of al Qaeda members were tried and convicted in Yemen of planning and perpetrating terrorist attacks against Yemeni officials and Western targets both in Yemen and abroad, includi ng additional suspects linked to the USS Cole bombing. On February 3, 2006, 23 convicted al Qaeda members, 13 of whom were tied to the USS Cole and Limburg bombings, escaped from the maximum-security prison in Sanaa; most remain at large. In September 2006, four suicide bombers were killed in a foiled attempt to bomb two Yemeni oil facilities; two of the four have been identified as being among the group of 23 escaped prisoners. As of June 2008, two al Qaeda suspects convicted in Yemen of terrorist attacks have also been indicted in U.S. courts and are wanted fo r trial in the United States, but Yemen has insisted that its constitution pr ecludes extradition of Yemeni citizens. Although al Qaeda continues to use Yemen as a base for training and operations, several incidents in the past two years de monstrate that the country itself is targeted for attack. In July 2007, a suicide bombing in Marib killed eight Sp anish tourists; in Ja nuary 2008, gunmen killed two Belgian tourists in Hadram out; in March 2008, a mortar attack that damaged a school was apparently aimed at the U.S. embassy; and in April 2008, bombs struck a residential complex inhabited by Westerners. According to the U.S. Department of State, Yemen's recent counterterrorism record is mixed. The government has been lax in enforcing terror ism convictions, provides lenient requirements for the completion of sentences to persons who surrender, has rele ased all 12 returned Guantanamo detainees, and lacks a comprehens ive counterterrorism law. However, Yemen's government continues to arrest and prosecute the perpetrators of terrori st attacks. There is concern that Yemen's government has a limited ca pacity for stemming terrorism financing and has been unable to freeze the financial assets of United Nations-designa ted al Qaeda supporters. There are also reports that Yemeni jihadists are in Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Somalia, and Lebanon and that Yemenites constitute one of the largest contingents of foreign fighters in Iraq (about 17 percent of total foreign fighters in Iraq according to some estimates). Human Rights: According to the U.S. Department of State's annual report on human rights practices, Yemen's government has maintained a poor human rights record, continuing to commit various abuses, including th e arbitrary arrest and killing of persons critical of the government, especially those affilia ted with the al-Houthi rebels of Sadaa. Security forces, which are generally considered corrupt, often detain persons for prolonged periods of time without due process, subjecting them to torture and abuse. Violence and discrimination against women have been reported, as well as discri mination against persons with di sabilities and ag ainst religious, 25 Library of Congress - Federal Research Division Country Profile: Yemen, August 2008 racial, and ethnic minorities. The ruling party ofte n controls the management of unions and trade union federations. Although Yemen's constitution protects privacy, government police forces routinely search citizens' property without warrants and monito r telephone, postal, and In ternet communications. Yemen's constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the press \"within the limits of the law,\" but this protection is also violated. Police forces often th reaten and harass journalists who are critical of the government in order to infl uence press coverage; physic al attacks have also been reported. Some journalists have been plac ed on trial for writing articles critical of the president or reporting on issues deemed sensitive to the government, and newspapers have been temporarily shut down for the same reasons. In June 2008, the editor of a weekly newspaper was imprisoned for allegedly supporting the al-Hout hi rebellion; the gove rnment's action is considered by the U.S. Department of State to be part of a \"distressing trend in Yemen of intimidation and prosecution of independent journa lists.\" Foreign publications are monitored for content and subject to censorsh ip. Legislation was enacted in 2005 mandating that journalists reveal their information sources in certain circ umstances and significantly raising start-up costs for newspapers and Web sites. 26 "}
