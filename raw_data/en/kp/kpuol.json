Chinese medicine views the body as an energetic system in dynamic balance. Unlike allopathic medicine, which focuses on symptoms and separates the disease from the person, Chinese medicine emphasizes a holistic approach that treats the mind, body, and spirit as one entity. Qi, which can be translated as energy or life force, flows in a regular pattern through a system of channels \u2014 or meridians \u2014 to all parts of the body. When the flow of Qi is unimpeded there is harmony, balance, and good health. When there are Qi blockages, too much or too little Qi, there is an imbalance, which can lead to disharmony and disease. Chinese medicine helps restore the body to balance and works on an energetic level to affect all aspects of a person: mind - body - spirit. The beauty of Chinese medicine is that it can be used to correct imbalances that have become illness and pain, or even correct imbalances prior to the appearance of symptoms, preventing disease. Chinese medicine treatments address imbalances using food therapy or diet, acupuncture and herbal remedies along with Western therapies. Chinese medicine is one of the longest existing continuous medical systems practiced in the world, with over 3000 years of history. "}
