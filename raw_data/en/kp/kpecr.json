PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis) is a once-daily medication to help prevent HIV infection in people who are HIV-negative but at substantial risk of HIV infection. PrEP is an essential tool for protecting yourself from HIV. See the Figure below. PrEP is highly effective for preventing HIV when taken as prescribed. Since PrEP only protects against HIV, condom use is still essential for protection against other STDs. Condom use helps prevent HIV if PrEP is not taken as prescribed. PrEP may benefit you if you are HIV-negative, and you have had anal or vaginal sex in the past six months and have a sexual partner with HIV. You have not consistently used a condom or been diagnosed with an STD in the past six months. You inject drugs and have an injection partner with HIV. You share needles and syringes to inject drugs. See the Figure below. Are you HIV-negative but at risk for HIV? Take Charge of Your Health. PrEP can help keep you free from HIV. IPH will be offering prescriptions for PrEP starting on June 1, 2022.
