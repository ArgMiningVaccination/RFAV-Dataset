However, scientific evidence does not support the use of juice cleanses. They could even be dangerous if people consume them instead of seeking proper medical care for certain health conditions. While the vegetable is nutritious, there is not much scientific evidence supporting the supposed benefits of a celery juice cleanse. Therefore, individuals should use caution when exploring cleanses and detoxes, even those containing healthy ingredients. This article examines celery, and the potential benefits and possible risks of a celery juice cleanse. A cleanse or detox involves removing specific foods from a person's diet designed to eliminate toxins from the body. This can come in the form of a fast, diet, drink, or powder. However, the body already performs a natural cleansing process. The digestive tract, liver, kidneys, and skin are responsible for breaking down toxins through urine, stool, or sweat. A juice cleanse is a diet where people only consume juices derived from fruits and vegetables. A cleanse can bring some nutritional benefits. However, doctors have identified certain health risks associated with a cleanse, such as organ damage. Nutrition plays an important role in supporting health, but even nutritious celery juice does not have beneficial properties. According to the [National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/detoxes-and-cleanses-what-you-need-to-know) However, celery does contain oxalates, which can be harmful to the kidneys at very high levels. In [one case](https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(13)00390-2/fulltext), a person severely damaged their kidneys through juice fasting. Problems associated with celery juice cleanses include: - If the celery juice does not receive treatment to prevent bacteria growth, it serious illness. [can cause](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/detoxes-and-cleanses-what-you-need-to-know) - Juicing celery eliminates fiber content, one of the vegetable's main benefits. - Severely [restrictive diets](/articles/322157)do not provide enough nutrition. - Other added juices may increase sugar and calories. Some [evidence](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29983105/) Some [research](https://www.journal-of-agroalimentary.ro/admin/articole/10601L48_Moigradean_Diana_2018_295-300.pdf) suggests that celery juice can boost the immune system. People are often attracted to the idea of juicing because it reportedly provides a quick and hydrating way to get lots of nutrients from vegetables. Indeed, vegetables are a suitable source of [antioxidants](/articles/325873). Though celery juice can be nutritious, there appears to be more scientific evidence suggesting that a [juice cleanse](/articles/323136) can negatively impact the body. Although a person will experience a reduced calorie intake, a cleanse does not offer an effective long-term solution to weight loss or general health problems. Before starting a juice cleanse, people should consult with a doctor or nutritionist to confirm whether they need to amend their diet or juicing plan to protect their overall health. Many people claim a celery juice cleanse has numerous benefits. However, there is [no scientific evidence](https://foodinsight.org/is-celery-juice-healthy-fad-diet-trends/) featuring controlled trials to back up these claims. Some of these unproven statements say celery juice cleanses can: - reduce inflammation - lower blood pressure - heal the liver - fight cancer - reduce bloating - support the digestive system - increase energy - support weight loss - promote mental health One of the biggest risks associated with these unsupported claims is that individuals with serious health concerns, such as cancer, may turn to cleanses instead of actual medical treatments. Other potential risks a person may experience include: - kidney stones and other kidney problems - greater risk of illness, especially for those with weakened immune systems - the loss of too many nutrients in their stool, which could lead to [dehydration](/articles/153363.php) - symptoms relating to low blood sugar, such as fainting, weakness, dehydration, [headaches](/articles/73936.php), and hunger A person can juice celery optimally by: - using a bunch of fresh celery to prepare the juice - separating the stalks - washing the celery before adding it to a juicer - chopping the stalks into pieces and placing them into a juicer An individual can also use a high-powered blender and add water to create a fiber-rich glass of celery juice. People can also include other fruits and vegetables and experiment with flavors. Apple and carrots, for example, pair well with celery. Drink the celery juice within 2 days. [One cup of raw celery](https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Celery%2C_raw_nutritional_value.html) provides the following: - 14 calories - 0.2 grams (g) fat - 81 milligrams of sodium, or 4% of the Daily Value (DV) - 3 g of carbohydrates, including 1.6 g of fiber, or 6%DV [One stalk of celery](https://foodinsight.org/is-celery-juice-healthy-fad-diet-trends/) provides: - 1 g of fiber - 15%DV of vitamin K - vitamin C - vitamin A - potassium - calcium - iron - electrolytes Celery is also a suitable source of magnesium, folate, [riboflavin](/articles/219561), vitamin B6, pantothenic acid, and manganese. Although celery is not a magic cure-all, it does have actual benefits. When a person eats it whole, celery is a [good source of fiber](https://foodinsight.org/is-celery-juice-healthy-fad-diet-trends/) and a filling, low calorie, low fat snack. Additionally, it helps people hydrate and is a good source of many nutrients. Researchers are also studying the [pharmacologic properties of celery](https://www.sysrevpharm.org/articles/review-on-the-pharmacological-and-health-aspects-of-apium-graveolens-or-celery-an-update.pdf), suggesting it has promise as a medicinal plant. Although this does not mean a celery juice diet will provide all its reported benefits, celery may have some of the following properties: - anti-inflammatory - antimicrobial - antifungal - anticancer - anti-ulcer - antidiabetic [hypolipidemic](/articles/317514), referring to helping with cholesterol - analgesic - cardioprotective - cyto- (protecting the cells) and neuroprotective activity Celery and cleanses have been a part of the traditional healer's toolkit for centuries. However, the vegetable has garnered much public attention due to celebrity endorsements and popular pseudoscience books. Enthusiasts claim celery juice cleanses can do everything from reducing inflammation to improving digestion and fighting cancer. However, healthcare professionals tend to take a dim view of cleanses and discourage extremely restrictive diets. That said, researchers are currently exploring the many pharmacological properties of celery and its potential for benefiting health. "}
