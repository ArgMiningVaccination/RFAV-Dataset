Obtaining this data can present challenges, depending on the meteri ng and billing configurations at a given property . Common -area utility bills are generally paid by property owners or managers, and should be accessible . Utility bills for individual units can be paid by tenants, and therefore may be harder to obtain . In some cases, owners and managers can access whole -property energy consumption data through the utility company or by obtaining data authorization agreements from tenants . If this is not feasible, the Better Buildings Challenge encourages partners to sample tenant energy usage by following the protocol below. As a companion to this document, the Multifamily Sampling Calculator spreadsheet tool may assist in determining requirements for sampling and calculating total energy usage. Procedure 1. Determine the fuel types to be measured: Sampling may be conducted for one or more fuel types at a property, depending on the billing configuration and data availability . If utility bills for a given fuel are tenant -paid, and energy use from the bills cannot be accessed thr ough the utility or other means, p artners should sample energy use. Sampling and extrapolated values may be calculated on a monthly or annual basis. 2. Define the Sample Set: To accurately reflect the energy usage of the property, sampled units should be representative of the range of units across the property. Determine the Level for Sampling: Depending on the characteristics of the property being sampled, sampling may occur at different levels: Property Level: If the buildings on the property share si milar size, age, condition, and energy configuration, sampling at the property level is appropriate. Building / Building Type Level: If a property's buildings have different sizes, ages, conditions, or energy configurations, then sampling at the building level may be appropriate. Buildings may be grouped into a single sample set if they are similar in size, age, condition, and energy configuration. Examples of properties that may be sampled at the property level: A single, 200 -unit apartment building A cam pus of 4 garden -style apartments Two high -rise apartment buildings Examples of properties that should be sampled by building/building type: A campus with 2 mid -rise buildings and 8 townhouse buildings A campus of 3 buildings, one of which has undergone ext ensive renovation Account for Different Unit Types and Sizes: Energy usage may vary between units based on the unit's characteristics. Partners are encouraged to sample a representative cross section of top floor, bottom floor, middle and corner units, a nd bedrooms . At the minimum, p artners are encouraged to differentiate unit types by number of bedrooms. Page 21 Learn more at energy.gov/betterbuildingschallenge FIGURE C -1: MINIMUM SAMPLE SIZE 3. Determine the sample size and randomly select units: Partners are encouraged to sample as many units as possible, in order to best represent the actual energy use for a property . Figure C-1 provides a minimum threshold for sample size that should be met.8 Determine the number of units to be sampled: At the level of sampling that is required (i.e., property level or building level), count the total units and use the sampling guidance table to select a total sample number. If there is variation i n unit types within the sample (e.g., multiple bedroom types within a property), the sample should be proportionally divided between unit types, rounding up. Example for sampling for different unit types: A 200 -unit high -rise building consists of 150 one -bedroom units and 50 two -bedroom units. The minimum sample size according to the above guidance is 10 units . For unit - specific sample sizes, the recommended total sample is multiplied by the proportion of units in the building, rounded up, as shown in Figure C-2 below. FIGURE C-2: EXAMPLE SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION WHOLE PROPERTY Number of Units 200 Recommended Sample Size 10 1-BEDROOM 2-BEDROOM Number of Units 150 50 Proportion of Total 150 (1 BR units) 200 (Total units) = .75 50 (2 BR units) 200 (Total units) = .25 Recommended Sample Size (Rounding Up) 10 * 0.75 8 10 * 0.25 3 4. Gather tenant data: Given the challenges associated with obtaining tenant data, the Better Buildings Challenge recommends outreach to all tenants in order to collect as much data as possible . The procedure below to estimate whole property data normalizes the data received based on unit type . If outreach is only possible to a subset of units, the subset should be representative of the property as a whole and sel ected randomly. An effective tenant outreach strategy ensures that the utilities involved are satisfied with the method of authorization and the tenants are informed and comfortable with energy authorization. Partners are encouraged to work closely with ut ilities and tenants to ensure a smooth tenant outreach process. A sample energy authorization form, along with an open letter to utilities from Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Juli\u00e1n Castro, is available upon request. Better Buildings Challenge partners are encouraged to share their best practices for tenant outreach. For more information on sharing best practices, contact your Account Manager. 8 The m inimum unit sample size was calculated by DOE's Weatherization Assistance Program as part of their Multifamily Retrofit Tools and Workforce Resources . It was developed with industry input and review as part of their technical guidelines for multifamily building energy audits.

Approaches for extrapolating sampled data to the building and/or property level and totaling all energy usage are covered below. Extrapolating Total Energy Use for the Type Sampled: Energy usage should be averaged for each unit type, then multiplied by the total number of units for each type (see table below): FIGURE C-3: EXAMPLE OF CALCULATING UNIT AVERAGES Calculating Whole -Building Energy Use and Energy Intensity: Once total tenant -area energy usage has been extrapolated, add owner -paid utility usage (e.g., electricity for common area and leasing office, exterior lighting, master -metered natural gas for he ating) . This may include energy usage for any relevant non - sampled spaces (e.g., a retail or restaurant space included as part of the property). To obtain energy use intensity, divide by the gross floor area of the property. FIGU RE C-4: CALCULATING WHOLE -PROPERTY ENERGY USE 6. Consider approaches for periodic sampling. It is recommended that the same sample be evaluated for the baseline period and subsequent reporting periods, to the extent it is possible . If data is not available for certain units, they should be replaced with similar units from the population. 7. Reporting energy performance. Partners should collect energy usage data from all of the properties in their portfolio into a single database. Better Bu ildings Challenge partners are encouraged to use ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager, or other energy benchmarking tools, to manage utility data and report results. Portfolio Manager provides a 1-100 ENERGY STAR score for eligible properties, which normalizes fo r changes in weather and operation. While 1-BEDROOM 2-BEDROOM Number of Units 150 50 # Units Sampled 18 6 Average Per Unit Total energy use for sampled 1BR units / 18 = 102,000 kBtu/unit Total energy use for sampled 2BR units / 6 = 156,000 kBtu/unit Unit Type Total 102 ,000 (kBtu unit) 150 total units =15,300 ,000 kBtu 156 ,000 (kBtu unit) 50 total units =7,800 ,000 kBtu Total Unit Energy 15,300,000 + 7,800,000 = 23,100,000 k Btu Note: Energy usage is tracked for the Better Buildings Challenge in Source kBtus. In the calculations above, energy usage has already been converted to source kBtus. Sampling may also be done by fuel type and converted later.

The tool also allows for easy sharing of data with the Better Buildings Challenge. Additional information about Portfolio Manager can be found in the 'Energy Tracking Software' section of the Data Tracking Manual. For each fuel type being sampled, p artners should extrapolate the total tenant -paid utility use and enter it as a separate meter in Portfolio Manager . Partners should check the box marked \"Estimation\" to indicate that the data is sampled, as shown in the figure below. "}
