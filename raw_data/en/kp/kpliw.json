They do most of the work in cells and are required for the structure, function, and regulation of the body's tissues and organs. Proteins are made up of hundreds or thousands of smaller units called amino acids, which are attached to one another in long chains. There are 20 different types of amino acids that can be combined to make a protein. The sequence of amino acids determines each protein's unique 3-dimensional structure and its specific function. Amino acids are coded by combinations of three DNA building blocks (nucleotides), determined by the sequence of genes. Proteins can be described according to their large range of functions in the body, listed in alphabetical order: | | Function | | Description Example | | Antibody | | Antibodies bind to specific foreign particles, such as viruses and bacteria, to help protect the body. | | Enzyme | | Enzymes carry out almost all of the thousands of chemical reactions that take place in cells. They also assist with the formation of new molecules by reading the genetic information stored in DNA. | | Messenger | | Messenger proteins, such as some types of hormones, transmit signals to coordinate biological processes between different cells, tissues, and organs. | | Structural component | | These proteins provide structure and support for cells. On a larger scale, they also allow the body to move. | | Transport/storage | | These proteins bind and carry atoms and small molecules within cells and throughout the body.
