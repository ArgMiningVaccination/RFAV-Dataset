It is also a good way to describe this past year - interprofessional and team -based. From the second annual Health and Wellness Conference to the Maryland Hospitals for a Healthy Environment organization becoming part of the Center to the ad dition of three new team members , the Center has been growing by leaps and bounds. Our second annual Health & Wellness Conference was held on Saturday, May 4, 2013 and this year, a joint effort was made to create an interprofessional conference curriculum, utilizing the expertise of representatives from each of the graduate schools on campus as part of an interprofessional advisory board. A wide variety of workshops were offered, including acupuncture, manual medicine, dietary supplements , spirituality and healing, Ayurveda, and mindfulness meditation . We also utilized a diverse group of instructors, including physicians, chiropractors, nurses, musicians, environmental specialists, personal trainers , and a lawyer to name a few. Dr. Mark Hyman, a physician, functional medicine expert, and advisor to the Dr. Oz Show , was our keynote speaker. He addressed the topic of how society influences our health and gave real -life examples of what each of us can do to create healthier lives - for ourselves and our patients. In the \"Changing the Paradigm of Health Care\" lunchtime panel, one of the three speakers, Thomas Scalea, MD, physician -in-chief of the University of Maryland R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center, said, \"It's not so much ab out what it is we do, it's about the total care package that we provide the people.\" In a unique learning environment, the conference gave participants the opportunity to network and learn about other modalities, thus enhancing their ability to work as pa rt of an interprofessional team - learn how to better be part of that total care package. With an overarching goal of engaging Maryland hospitals and health care providers to become leaders in environmental health and sustainability, MD H2E (Maryland Hospi tals for a Healthy Environment) has been advancing a \"culture of environmental health and sustainability \" in Maryland's health care community since 2005. They recently joined the Center for Integrative Medicine team, enlarging our interdisciplinary reach and aiding our goals of health and wellness education and promotion. Environmental health and sustainability incorporates waste and toxics prevention, resource conservation, healthy sustainable food procurement, and population health and wellness. It has an interprofessional influence and we are thrilled to have them as part of our team. This year we brought on board three new faculty members, a psychologist from Duke University with a passion for spirituality, a physician with a background in medical technology, and a physician with a Master's in Divinity. They all bring to the healing circle unique gifts that are already strengthening the DIRECTOR'S LETTER 2 Center's interprofessional influence. For example, Dr. Michelle Pearce, our psychologist, developed, designed, and coordinated an Applied Thanatology Graduate Certificate Program, \"Death, Dying, and Mourning.\" This is an interdisciplinary program and will be targeted to students from each of the six different graduate schools and healthcare professionals throughout th e University of Maryland System and beyond. Our new Director of Clinical Services, Dr. William Rollow, came to the Center from IBM in April 2013 and has already been making connections with the leaders across the healthcare disciplines, making a network o f \"team members\" that the Center will be working with at the University of Maryland Rehabilitation and Orthopaedics Institute (UMROI, formerly known as Kernan Hospital) and is beginning to establish a rapport with leaders throughout the University of Maryland Medical System. Dr. John Reed, who completed his Masters of Divinity at Harvard Divinity School, began working with the Center in June of 2013. He is the Director of Inpatient Services, a newly established position that is working with the leadership of UMROI and University of Maryland Medical Center to plan and create an inpatient, team - based integrative medicine consult service, which will involve physician s, nurses, and a wide range of allied health professionals. The inpatient program will be the utmost in \"interprofessional, team -based care.\" In addition, the Center continues to work hand -in-hand with the Institute for Integrative Health. \"Spice My Plate,\" a research study designed and implemented by Dr. Chris D'Adamo and funded by McCormick Sciences Institute, was a wonderful collaboration between the two - and had phenomenal results influencing the eating habits of high school students ! We also collaborat ed on an International Scientific Think Tank with Heel on bioregulatory medicine and inflammation, and several of the CIM faculty regularly participate in the Institute's Wellness talks. From research to education to patient care, the Center for Integrativ e Medicine is bringing a new meaning to what \"Integrative\" really means - interdisciplinary and team -based. Sincerely, Brian Berman, MD Executive Summary 3 The following report is an overview of the major achievements of the University of Maryland Center for Integrative Medicine over the period of July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2013 . Mission Statement Emphasizing an approach to healing that values mind, bo dy, and spirit, the Center is committed to evaluating the scientific foundation of complementary and alternative medicine, educating health professionals and the public, and integrating evidence -based complementary therapies into clinical care to help peop le achieve and maintain optimal health and well -being. Executive Summary 2012 -2013 Research (see Appendix A for full list of Research Publications ) Arthritis Traditio nal Chinese Medicine (TCM) and A rthritis National Institutes of Health (NIH) Center of Excellence grant (funded 2005 -2011). This Center grant has been successfully completed and the results have been analyzed and submitted for publication. Pain A pilot clinical study, funded by the Paralyzed Veter ans of America Research Foundation (Janua ry 2012 - June 2013), has been currently conducting to investigat e the effect of a special type of auricular acupuncture known as \"Battle Field Acupuncture\" for spinal cord injury patients who suffer from neuropathic pain. A basic science investigation, f unded by National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), evaluat ed the effects and mechanisms of electroacupuncture on pain -induced affective response. Some results of this study have been published in two peer -reviewed journals and ot hers have been submitted to the journal Neuroscience for publication . An NIH Fogarty International Center grant (July 201 0 - June 201 3) allow ed us to work with Longhua Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Shanghai, China, to study the mechanisms of a topical Chinese herbal formula on cancer pain. The results of this study have been published in Journal of Ethnopharmacology and submitted to Evidence -Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine for publication. The University of Maryland has been named a Center of Excellence in Pain Education. A collaboration between several University of Maryland graduate schools, the study will be developing an online integrative foundational curriculum that will provide a shared learning expe rience for dental, medical, nursing, and pharmacy students . Healing From Trauma We are assessing the long term effects of our prior study of a mindfulness intervention for child abuse survivors (MICAS) in a follow -up study (MICAS II). In the first long -term assessment of this type intervention in this population, we have observed that improvements in mood and mindfulness EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 2012 -2013 4 have largely been maintained from the 24 -week to the 24 -month evaluations. Preparation of this manuscript is currently underway. Acupun cture and Meditation for Wellness (AMWELL) was a pilot randomized clinical trial in child abuse survivors with symptoms of psychological distress, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and chronic pain. In this trial subjec ts were randomized to receive acupuncture, mindfulness -based stress reduction group therapy, or wait list control with measurements of depressive symptoms, PTSD, post -traumatic growth, coping self -efficacy, perceived stress, pain symptoms, sleep quality, mindfulness and sustai ned cognitive attention. Study recruitment was completed in Fall 2010, and data analyses and publication preparation are currently underway. An abstract entitled Acupuncture and Mindfulness - Based Stress Reduction among Child Abuse Survivors with PTSD: A R andomized Waitlist -Controlled Pilot Study was submitted for presentation at the International Society for Traumatic Stress in Philadelphia, PA , November 2013. In a similar population of child sexual abuse survivors with symptoms of PTSD, depression psycho logical distress, and chronic pain we conducted a fe asibility study to compare Cognitive Processing Therapy to alternative approaches to the treatment of PTSD a nd other comorbid disord ers. In order to begin to compare these treatment options, three small g roups of subjects were recruited and trea ted with CPT. Dr. Dempsey train ed at the VAMHCS in Baltimore, MD led the CPT treatment groups. Outcome data will be compared with that from AMWELL. Data analyses are complete and will be followed by data comparison with the AMWELL study (see above). In a veteran population, a pilot study funded by the Mental Insight Foundation sought to compare alternative treatments for PTSD to Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), which is used more commonly used in the Veterans A dministration (VA). The Cognitive Processing Therapy and Mindfulness in Veterans with PTSD study was led by Dr. Catherine L Dempsey and Drs . Amdur and Berman. It was a pilot study that assess ed the eff icacy of Mindfulness -based Stress Reduction (MBSR) in c omparison to Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) in veterans with a diagnosis of PTSD. Data collection commenced in April 2011 and was completed in August, 2012. Data analysis and manuscript preparation is now underway. In order to begin to compare these t reatment options, three small groups of subjects were recruited and treated with CPT. Outcome data will be compared with that from AMWELL. So far, the most important difficulty has been recruiting subjects for this process , which requires re -living traumat ic experiences. Data analysis is underway and will be followed by data comparison with the AMWELL study (see above). Addiction Through National Institute on Drug Abuse funding, we conducted a therapy development study using an integrative meditation inter vention for cocaine addicts . An Independent Investigator Award from the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression support ed a therapy development study to investigate add ing breathing -based integrative meditation to a methadone program to help patients with anxiety disorders develop skills in coping with stress/anxiety, reduce anxiety sensitivity, and improve overall treatment outcomes. Data analysis concluded that the patients who added a breathing -based integrative meditation to the methadone program showed a significant improvement on the quality of life scale. In collaboration with University of Massachusetts Medical School , we are evaluating external Qigong Therapy for reducing cue -elicited craving and improving recovery from cocai ne addiction 5 (R21) . The study showed that external Qigong therapy was effective among cocaine -dependent individuals early in residential treatment. Cancer Through th e University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center and Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Compreh ensive Cancer Center , we have collaborated on a randomized, placebo -controlled trial to evaluate the effect of acupuncture on Aromatase Inhibitor Associated Musculoskeletal Symptoms (AIMSS), menopausal symptoms, and quality of life in breast cancer patient s. A statistically significant reduction in the cells that cause inflammation (IL -17) was observed. A single -center, one treatment arm clinical trial assessing the efficacy, feasibility and safety of acupuncture in reducing the severity of bortezomib -induced peripheral neuropathy (BIPN) in multiple myeloma patients was launched in May 2011 and concluded in May 2012. Overall, patients reported improved daily functions and decreased pain when receiving acupuncture during chemotherapy. There were no advers e events associated with the acupuncture treatment. In a National Cancer Institutes -funded study, a single -center, pilot, randomized, standard care - and placebo (sham acupuncture) -controlled clinical trial is being conducted to assess the effects of acupu ncture to prevent chemotherapy dose reduction to chemotherapy -induced peripheral neuropathy and to elucidate the mechanism of action. In a single -center, randomized controlled pilot clinical trial, the efficacy, feasibility and safety of acupuncture in re ducing the severity of chemoradiation -induced oral mucositis in patients with oropharyngeal cancer will be studied. Depression In partnership with faculty from Duke University Medical Center, a multi -site pilot study investigating religious psychotherapy for major depression in patients with chronic illness is being conducted. The grant involves preparing for and conducting a randomized clinical trial comparing effectiveness of conventional versus religious cognitive behavioral therapy for major depressio n in medical patients with chronic illness. Wellness In collaboration with the University of Maryland Baltimore (UMB) Wellness Hub, the Center for Integrative Medicine is helping to coordinate efforts to enhance eight dimensions of wellness by offering di dactic and experiential educational content to students and faculty at the SMC student center. A unique, multidimensional stress reduction program, entitled Positive Mindset Training, has been developed by CIM faculty. It incorporates well -researched pri nciples from the fields of meditation, cognitive behavioral psychology, positive psychology and Qigong. The 8 hour program has been tested in two interdisciplinary groups of UMB students with positive results. Plans are underway to offer the program to U MB administration, UMB students and the general public. Nutrition Funded by the McCormick Science Institute, a six -week educational intervention was conducted, comparing the impact of a spices and herbs intervention to standard nutrition education on th e quality of diet of high school students in 2 inner city Baltimore schools. The intervention was determined to be feasible and effective among high school students in Baltimore. Additionally, 6 there was a greater 90% compliance rate and students who recei ved the intervention increased their protein and whole grain intake and expressed improved attitudes toward healthy eating. An analysis of the genetic predictors of a wide variety of micronutrients important to health was conducted. This work was funded b y the Mid-Atlantic Nutrition and Obesity Research Center and National Institutes of Health - National Institute of Diabetes and Diges tive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). A number of genetic predictors of concentrations of selected micronutrients were identif ied and the collective results contribute to the advancement of personalized nutrition for the prevention and treatment of chronic disease. In a project funded by the Unhwa Corporation, a study was conducted to analyze the chronic toxicity of ginseng CMCs in the rat subject. Studies showed no abnormal results in study subjects. Nutramax Laboratories is funding a randomized, placebo -controlled clinical trial of a mushroom - based dietary supplement. The study will analyze the effect of this supplement on th e incidence, frequency, and duration of the common cold. Exercise The Center for Integrative Medicine is leading the first exercise intervention for patients suffering from persistent symptoms of Lyme Disease. This groundbreaking study evaluate d whether exercise is a feasible and safe treatment option for the growing number of people suffering from Lyme Disease. As a result of this study, it was determined that this exercise intervention is a feasible and effective means of managing chronic Lyme Disease sy mptoms. Other Research Projects and Collaborations As part of a program and study funded by the Health Resources Services Administration, two faculty members from the Center for Integrative Medicine are serving as co -investigators on the implementation an d evaluation of an Integrative Medicine Program for the Preventative Medicine Residency at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Clinical Outcomes Research We continued to participat e in the Bravewell Collaborative Clinical Network, a consortium of nine leading integrative medicine clinics that are sharing insights and resources in integrative patient care, clinic management, and research in order to promote leading edge practices in integrative medicine. The nine clinics are also part of the onl y integrative medicine practice -based research network (PBRN), BraveNet. Its first project was to conduct a survey of 4000 patients to determine reasons for seeking care at integrative medicine clinics. Across the board, improving wellness and prevention o f future problems were the most common reasons given, even among patients with serious illness. This manuscript was published in Explore . CIM joined the integrative medicine clinical data registry called PRIMIER (Patients Receiving Integrative Medicine In terventions Registry), which , via a web -based instrument, will collect longitudinal outcomes data on all patients seen in the BraveNet and other select integrative medicine clinics. Data collection is anticipated to begin in early 2014. 7 Informatics Coor dinator (since 199 6) of the CAM Field of the Cochrane Collaboration (an international organization that currently involves more than 27,000 contributors from 110 countries dedicated to evaluating all medical therapies) Through competitive application for NIH funding, we received an almost perfect score and were awarded a 5 year, $3 million grant to continue our comprehensive effort to collect, synthesize, and evaluate all the scientific literature in complementary medicine and disseminate high quality information globally.

Research 13 The goals of CIM's research program are to: Focus on prevalent health conditions for which new answers are urgently needed, including basic and applied or clinical research on pain, focusing on research that will offer effective strategies for the treatment of pain, clinical studies on integrative approaches to promote healing from acute and chronic conditions, ranging from inflammatory pain and cancer to trauma. Evaluate the safety, efficacy and mechanism of action of complementary therapies, in pa rticular, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), mind/body approaches, homeopathy, multidimentional wellness, and innovative new technologies. Assess the value of integrative medical approaches that incorporate proven complementary therapies and explore the role that elements such as belief, expectations, and patient -practitioner relationship play in healing . Over the past year we have continued to build an extensive research portfolio ranging from basic science to clinical trials, and have developed a netw ork of collaborations with leading scientists and clinicians in departments across the Schools of Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Social Work, and Nursing, as well as at other top institutions nationally and internationally. We have published the results o f our studies in major peer-reviewed journals, resulting in 57 publications and abstracts within the past year and 7 more in press (see Appendix A ). On-going Research The following is an overview of our accomplishments and our on -going research over the past year . Our projects are organized by theme and descriptions of planned future projects can be found at the end. Theme: Arthritis Center for Research in Complementary and Alternative Medicine in Arthritis and Traditional Chinese Medicine PI: Brian B erman, MD; Co -PI: Lixing Lao, PhD This Center of Excellence for Research on CAM (CERC) program project grant (P -01), funded in 2005 by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) in the amount of $6 million, builds on our subst antial track record in examining the safety, efficacy, and mechanism of action associated with common TCM treatments (acupuncture and herbs) for arthritis. We have successfully completed this Center research project during the last year and have been prepa ring and submitting manuscripts for publications in medical journals. The research projects include: Project 1: A Phase II Dose -Finding, Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Clinical Trial of a Chinese Herbal Compound Huo -Luo-Xiao -Ling (HLXL) for Knee OA PI: Brian Berman, MD Objective: The first project in the CERC is a randomized, placebo -controlled, dose -finding study of a traditional Chinese medicine 11 -herb mixture called Huo -Luo-Xiao-Ling Dan (HLXL) to improve symptoms RESEARCH 14 of participants with o steoarthritis of the knee. This clinical trial, 'Traditional Chinese Medicine for OA of the Knee (TCM -OAK)', has as its co -primary outcomes change in function and pain scores of the Western Ontario McMaster Universities (WOMAC) Osteoarthritis index. The s tudy was launched in May of 2007. Summary : A total of 92 patients were enrolled: 53 in the U.S. and 39 in Hong Kong. Overall, the mean age was 60 years, 65 (71%) were women and 64 (70%) were of Asian ethnicity. Mean (SD) baseline WOMAC pain and function sc ore was 4.3 (1.5) and 4.2 (1.6), respectively, and PGA was 2.2 (0.8). There were no significant differences between HLXL - and placebo -treated groups in baseline variables. While both groups had significant improvement in all outcome measures after 8 weeks, there were no significant differences between the HLXL - and placebo -treated groups. At 8 weeks, about two -thirds of subjects noted that they were better based on PGART responses; there was no difference between treatment groups. In mixed models repeated m easures analysis, there were no significant differences in WOMAC pain or function scores or PGA between groups; furthermore, there was no interaction between clinical site and degree of improvement. Average adherence exceeded 80 percent and was similar bet ween clinical sites. Finally, there was a significantly greater rise in mean ALT levels in the HLXL -treated group compared with the placebo -treated group (3.8 [10.4] vs 0.1 [5.8] U/l) but no significant difference in either AST or GT levels. In conclusion , these data fail to demonstrate that a proprietary form of the Chinese herbal compound HLXL Dan is efficacious for treating the symptoms of knee OA . A manuscript preparation is current under way. Project 2: Mechanisms of Acupuncture' s Effect on Inflammator y Pain PI: Lixing Lao, PhD, LAc Objective: The second project in the CERC is an investigation of the mechanisms by which electro - acupuncture (EA) has anti -inflammatory effects on pain. The study is being carried out in a rat model. Summary : 1) We have finished studies demonstrating that EA activates corticotropin -releasing factor (CRF) neurons in the paraventricular nuclei (PVN) which is located in the hypothalamus to significantly increase plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone l evels which suppress inflammation. 2) We have demonstrated that EA significantly inhibits hyperalgesia through activating supraspinal descending inhibitory system, seretonergic and catecholaminergic neurons in the brain that project to the spinal cord t hrough the dorsolateral nerve pathway . Endogenous containing neurons, disinhibiting serotonin -containing neurons that project to the spinal cord to block the transmission of noxious messages in the spinal cord. Our stud y showed that 2a -ARs and 5 -HT1ARs are involved in EA inhibition of inflammatory pain. 3) Our study has also demonstrated that spinal IL -17 is produced by astrocytes and enhances p -NR1 to facilitate inflammatory pain and EA inhibits hyperalgesia by suppr essing IL -17. This data has been published in 14 peer -reviewed journals and orally presented in 15 workshop sessions. 4) Additionally, using monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) -induced knee osteoarthritis (OA) pain rat model, we demonstrated that EA treatment improved hind limb body weight bearing on the injured limb, inhibited mechanically - and thermally -evoked pain and, alleviated OA -associated affective component of pain. The pilot study also that increased anterior cingulate cortex /Mortex cortex 1/Sensory cortex 1 connectivity in OA that was not present in naive or EA -treated rats , indicating that EA modulate central nervous system activities to inhibit pain. These preliminary data will be used for NIH grant application. 15 Project 3: Modulation of Autoimmu ne Arthritis by Chinese Herbs PI: Kamal Moudgil, PhD Objective: The third project of the CERC is to determine the immunological basis of the anti -inflammatory activity of HLXL. Summary : We extended our earlier study showing the anti -arthritic activity of Huo -luo-xiao-ling dan (HLXL) to determine the mechanism by which this herbal mixture affords protection against inflammation and bone damage in arthritis. In addition, we undertook a global gene expression study using microarray analysis t o get an insight into different pathways influenced by HLXL. These studies were performed in the rat adjuvant arthritis (AA) model of human rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The results of 3 studies are summarized below. Taken together, our results suggest that H LXL might offer a promising alternative/adjunct treatment for both inflammation and bone damage in RA. 1. Nanjundaiah SM, Lee DY, Berman BM, Moudgil KD. Chinese Herbal Formula Huo -Luo-Xiao-Ling Dan P rotects against Bone Damage in Adjuvant Arthritis by Modulating the Mediators of Bone Remodeling. Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2013;2013:429606. This study was aimed at evaluating the efficacy of HLXL against bone damage in the rat adjuvant arthri tis (AA) model of human rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We observed that treatment with HLXL (2.3 g/kg/day by gavage, beginning at the onset of AA and then continued throughout the study period) reduced bone and cartilage damage in the joints of arthritic Lewis rats compared to control, vehicle -treated rats. This protective effect of HLXL was mediated primarily via inhibition of mediators of osteoclastic bone remodeling (e.g., receptor activator of nuclear kappa -B ligand; RANKL), deviation of RANKL/osteop rotegerin (OPG) ratio in of antiosteoclastic activity, reduction in the number of osteoclasts in the bones forming the joint, and inhibition of cytokine production and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity. 2.

Evid Based Complement Alternat Med . 2012;2012:5892 56. In another study based on the rat AA model, we tested the effect HLXL on chemokines and MMPs. Chemokines play a vital role in the migration of leukocytes from the blood into the joints, whereas MMPs are involved in damage to cartilage and bone. The tr eatment protocol for HLXL was the same as described above. Rats were euthanized at the peak phase of AA, and their draining lymph node cells (LNC) and spleen adherent cells (SAC) were tested. The HLXL -treated rats showed a significant reduction in the levels of chemokines (RANTES, MCP -1, MIP -1, and GRO/KC) and MMPs (MMP 2 and 9) compared to the control rats. 3.

Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2013 (In Press) We performed analysis of gene expression using oligonucleotide microarrays in the lymph node cells (LNC) harvested from arthritic rats before and after 7 days of treatment with HLXL or vehicle (Water). LNC were restimulated in vitro with the disease -related antigen mycobacterial heat -shock protein 65. Cells cultured in medium alone served as controls. We identified 84 differentially -expressed genes (DEG) (64 upregulated and 20 upregulated 26 downregulated) in HLXL -treated versus 16 Water -treated groups, respectively. Further 62 DEG (45 upregulated and 17 downregulated) were shared between the two groups. The arthritis -related pathways influenced by HL XL included immune response, inflammation, cellular proliferation and apoptosis, and metabolic processes. Theme: Pain Auricular Acupuncture for Spinal Cord Injury Related Neuropathic Pain PI: Lixing Lao, Ph.D. Summary of the project: This is a small p ilot clinical study to investigate the effect of a special auricular acupuncture known as \"Battle Field Acupuncture\" for spinal cord injury patients who suffer from ne uropathic pain. This study is f unded by the Paralyzed Veterans of America, PVA Research F oundation (01/01/2012 - 12/31/2012, extended to June 30, 2013) There is a heavy burden of suffering arising from neuropathic pain following spinal cord injury. About one -third of persons with SCI experience severe neuropathic pain that does not resolve, is r efractory to conventional trea tment, and contributes to poor social functioning and community reintegration. This is a collaborative research project between acupuncture researchers/practitioners and spinal cord medicine specialists to investigate the effi cacy and safety of the Battlefield Acupuncture (BFA) auricular protocol on chronic SCI -related neuropathic pain. This project will investigate the effects of auricular acupuncture on chronic SCI -related neuropathic pain by comparing pain scores, usage of p ain medications, and other measures of improvement before and after an 8 -week period of weekly acupuncture sessions. Our overall hypothesis is that acupuncture treatment will safely reduce pain intensity in patients with chronic spinal cord injury and neur opathic pain. Progress: The human research protocol has recently been approved by the University of Maryland Institutional Review Board (IRB) in August. Patient enrollment will start in late August/ early September of 2012. We expect to complete the trial within one year . As of June 2013, we have recruited 20 patients toward the total targeted sample size of 24 patients. No adverse effects have been reported. We expect the trial will be completed by the end of 2013. Effects of Acupuncture on Pain -Induced A ffective Response PI: Ruixin Zhang, PhD We have completed the NCCAM -funded basic science investigation entitled \" Effects of Acupuncture on Pain-induced Affective Response \" (12/01/2003 - 11/30/2012) . Pain has both sensory -discriminative and emotional -affective dimensions. Previous studies demonstrate that electroacupuncture (EA) alleviates the sensory dimension but do not address the affective. An inflammatory pain rat model, produced by a complete Freund adjuvant (CFA) injection into th e hind paw, was co mbined with a conditioned place avoidance (CPA) test to determine whether EA inhibits spontaneous pain -induced affective response and, if so, to study the underpinned mechanisms . Male Sprague -Dawley rats (250 -275g, Harlan) were used. Final Results: The rats showed place aversion (i.e. affective pain) by spending less time in a pain -paired compartment after conditioning than during a preconditioning test. In our study, intra-anterior cingulate cortes (ACC) mu and kappa opioid receptor antagonist blocked E A inhibition of affection pain. Intra-ACC 5 - HT1AR antagonists blocked EA inhibition of affective, mechanical but not thermal pain, suggesting that EA inhibits pain by activating 5 -HT1ARs. It has been reported that phosphorylated Ca2+/calmodulin -dependent protein kinase II (pCaMKII) accounts for the increased anxiety -related behaviors shown by 5 -HT1AR 17 knockout mice and that 5 -HT1AR activation inhibits pCaMKII. CaMKII -driven AMPAR subunit GluA1 phosphorylation in the ACC may also be involved in anxiety -like b ehavior. In our study, EA inhibited both pCaMKII and pGluA1. Data also demonstrated that Intra- the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) DAMGO , a mu opioid receptor agonist, significantly inhibited the display of CPA compared to saline (P<0.05) but had no effect on paw withdrawal latency . The data has been published in following two journals , was presented in the 8th annual ICCMR congress in London, England, April 11 -13, 2013, and was submitted to the journal Neuroscience : o Zhang Y, Meng X, Li A, Xin J, Berman BM, Lao L, Tan M, Ren K, Zhang RX.

The Mechanism of a Chinese Herbal Formula on Cancer Pain PI: Lixing Lao, co -I: Ruixin Zhang, USA; Co -PI: Ling Xu, China In July 2010, we received an NIH Fogarty Inter national Center grant to work with Longhua Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Shanghai, China. This is an international research study on the mechanisms of a topical Chinese herbal formula on cancer pain. This three -year res earch project will be performed at Longhua Hospital in Shanghai, China. The objective of the proposal is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an herbal formula TLSJ on cancer pain and explore its mechanisms in rat cancer models. The success of the stud y will provide preliminary data for designing clinical trials to study the effects of Chinese herbs on persistent cancer pain. Final Results: The data showed that TLSJ, prepared from 7 herbs, treatment significantly restored bone cancer -induced decreas e of Paw Withdrawal Latency (PWL) and mechani cal threshold compared to inert gel. It also decreased the level of blood serum Carboxyterminal pyridinoline cross -linked alkaline phosphatase (BAP) and inhibited No adverse effects or abn ormal biochemical and histological changes were detected after TLSJ treatment. The study shows that TLSJ significantly inhibits bone cancer -induced thermal and mechanical sensitization. It suggests that the gel may be useful in managing cancer pain and that it may act by inhibiting osteoclastic activity. Studies also showed that TLSJ inhibited cancer -enhanced expressions of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1), TRPA1 and dorsal root ganglion cord . TRP antagonist attenuated mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia, and IL -17A expression, indicating that TRP channels facilitate cancer pain and spinal I L-17 expression. IL -17A antibody inhibited cancer pain, suggesting that IL -17A promotes such pain. Since prior study report that TLSJ suppress osteoclast activities in cancer -bearing bone. It is concluded that LTTL inhibits osteoclast activities, conseque ntly decreasing TRP and IL -17A activities to inhibit cancer pain. The new data has been submitted to Evidence -Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine (eCAM) for publication. 18 The data has been published in the Journ al of Ethnopharmacology (Wang J, Zh ang R, Dong C, Jiao L, Xu L, Liu J, Wang Z, Mao Ying QL, Fong H, Lao L. Topical treatment with Tong -Luo-San-Jie gel alleviates bone cancer pain in rats. J Ethnopharmacol ; 2012 Oct 11;143(3):905 -13. doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2012.08.026. Epub 2012 Aug 30. PMID: 22960543) . A second paper has been submitted to a journal for publication. Interprofessional Foundations and Applications in Pain Management PIs: Sharon Gordon and Mary Lynn McPherson (CIM Consult ant: Delia Chiaramonte, MD) NIH Pain Consortium named the University of Maryland one of 11 Centers of Excellence in Pain Education (CoEPE). The purpose of the grant is to develop an interprofessional /interdisciplinary pain management curriculum resource f or health care professionals to advance the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of pain. UMB collaborators include faculty from the Schools of Nursing, Pharmacy, Medicine, Dentistry, and Graduate Education. The goal is to develop an online (web -based) i ntegrative foundational curriculum called Interprofessional Foundations and Applications in Pain Management. This resource will provide a shared learning experience for dental, medical, nursing, and pharmacy students early in their professional training a nd, in the future, for continuing education. In and interactive web -based environment, integrative case scenarios will illustrate and reinforce the foundational curriculum which has content that is common to students from all four disciplines. Dr. Delia Chiaramonte of the Center for Integrative Medicine will serve as a content expert on complementary and integrative medicine. Theme: Healing From Trauma Mindfulness Intervention for Child Abuse Survivors - Follow -Up (MICAS -II) PI: Brian Berman , MD (Origina l PI: Elizabeth Kimbrough, PhD) In this study, Dr. Elizabeth Kimbrough and Dr. Lixing Lao wanted to compare the potential benefit observed in the previous MICAS study to adult trauma survivors of childhood sexual abuse with the effect of acupuncture. Dr. Catherine Dempsey and Dr. Margaret Chesney joined the team upon Dr. Kimbrough's illness in January 2010 to see the project through to fruition . The MICAS study demonstrated that the mindfulness intervention (MBSR) was associated with reductions in depress ive and PTSD symptoms, and that it was safe and favorably received by participants. Acupuncture also has been shown in clinical trials to decrease depression, and to reduce PTSD symptoms among trauma survivors. However, neither MBSR nor acupuncture had bee n tested in a controlled clinical trial among a patient population consisting exclusively of adult trauma survivors of childhood sexual abuse. To investigate this, we conducted the \"Acupuncture and Meditation for Wellness \" (AMWELL) study, a randomized, waitlist -controlled study of these two therapies. In this study, 93 participants were randomized to 8 weeks of acupuncture treatment, or MBSR, or to waitlist control group. All participants were assessed at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 weeks for depressive sympto ms, PTSD, post -traumatic growth, coping self - efficacy, perceived stress, pain symptoms, sleep quality, mindfulness and sustained cognitive attention. The primary outcome is reduction of depressive symptoms at 8 weeks, and secondary outcomes are change in the remaining measures a t 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Additional ou tcomes explored in a small subset of subjects is the effect of the interventions on sustained attention, collected at baseline and 8 weeks and on neurotransmitters as measured in the urine at baseli ne, 8 and 12 weeks . We hypothesized that, compared to controls: 1) both therapies will be associated with decreased depression, PTSD, and improved sleep; 2) MBSR will be associated with increased post -traumatic growth, coping self -efficacy, mindfulness an d 19 decreased perceived stress, to a greater degree than acupuncture; 3) acupuncture will be associated with decreases in pain to a greater degree than MBSR; 4) MBSR will be associated with greater improvements in sustained attention than will the acupunctur e intervention. In addition, all waitlist control participants were offered both MBSR and acupuncture once they have completed their time in the study as a control subject. Their outcomes were followed during their participation in both interventions. Ninety -three participants completed the study protocol, and recruitment was completed in late fall 2010. This year we had the ongoing participation on this study of a Research Psychologist, from the Center of the Study for Traumatic Stress, in the Departme nt of Psychiatry at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda who completed the data analyses for the AMWELL study and prepared the initial publications. The abstract entitled Acupuncture and Mindfulness - Based Stress Reduction among Child Abuse Surviv ors with PTSD: A Randomized Waitlist -Controlled Pilot Study was submitted to the International Society of Traumatic Stress for presentation in November 2013 in Philadelphia, PA. The authors are Catherine L. Dempsey PhD, MPH, Margaret Chesney PhD , Lixing La o MD, PhD, LAc, Trish Magyari, MS, Patti Vegella MS., MA., Mary Bahr -Robertson, Brian Berman MD, and Elizabeth Kimbrough PhD, MPH. We are grateful to the Mental Insight Foundation for the generous funding they have provided for this study. Center for Integrative Medicine - Veterans Collaborative Trauma Study Cognitive Processing Therapy and Mindfulness Intervention for Child Abuse Sur vivors (AMWELL -CPT) PI: Brian Berman MD; Co -Investigators: Catherine L Dempsey, PhD, MPH and Margaret Chesney, PhD The Center for Integrative Medicine - Veterans Collaborative Trauma Study (CIM -VETS) , also known as the \" Cognitive Processing Therapy and Mindfulness Intervention for Child Abuse Survivors (AMWELL - CPT)\" project was an inaugural collaboration between the Ce nter of Integrative Medicine (CIM) and the Veterans Administration Maryland Health Care System (VAMHCS). It was a pilot research study comparing Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) to Mindfulness -based Stress Reduction (MBSR) for adult survivors of childho od sexual abuse. CPT is a therapeutic treatment that is commonly used in the veterans administration for treating PTSD. This study conducted the CPT intervention with participants similar to those participating in the current study at CIM known as AMWE LL, which is testing MBSR (see \" Acupuncture and Meditation for Wellness (AMWELL)\" above). These two studies use identical intervention -effect assessments, enabling the results obtained in the AMWELL -CPT study to be compared with those obtained in the AMW ELL study, providing an accurate comparison of CPT and MBSR interventions. We screened a total of 33 adult survivors of sexual trauma for the CPT study. 10 participants were enrolled and 8 completed both the CPT intervention and the assessments (2 parti cipants dropped out after baseline assessments). Dr. Catherine Dempsey was the CPT interventionist during her Clinical Psychology Internship at the VAMHCS. Preliminary findings for the study were presented by Dr. Dempsey at the VAMHCS in June 2010. Now, t hat the AMWELL data analyses are complete , we will be able to compare and analy ze the data from both studies and begin manuscript prepar ation, which will begin in the summer, 2013 . This pilot study was very important to CIM because it provided an opportu nity to expand its treatment approaches to PTSD to include the predominant approach being applied at the VA. We met key study milestones: developmen t of the study proposal, submission of the study protocol to the University of Maryland IRB, experience in conducting CPT interventions, collection of pilot data for a direct comparison of CPT to MBSR in the treatment of sexual trauma, and most importantly, we have been able to use this 20 experience to apply and receive funding for a new study in a a veteran pop ulation at the Washington DC VA Medical Center. The resulting study, \" Cognitive Processing Therapy and Mindfulness in Veterans with PTSD \" (see next study) , was funded by the Mental Insight Foundation and is now underway. We are grateful to the Kohlberg Foundation for the generous funding they have provided for the AMWELL - CPT Study . *NOTE: The PI of this study was originally Dr. Elizabeth Kimbrough. Due to Dr. Kimbrough's untimely death, Dr. Joyce Frye became the PI for the University of Maryland. Dr. Catherine L. Dempsey and Dr. Margaret Chesney met regularly with Dr. Frye throughout this project and will continue to do so for the data analysis and completion. Cognitive Processing Therapy and Mi ndfulness in Veterans with PTSD PIs: Catherine L. Dempsey PhD, MPH , Richard Amdur PhD (DC VA Medical Center), and Brian Berman , MD (CIM) This pilot study , funded by the Mental Insight Foundation , explored the effectiveness of CPT to MBSR in veterans with a diagnosis of PTSD. The study aims were to target vetera ns in critical need of treatment with a diagnosis of PTSD, to determine the feasibility of enrolling patients and to establish a collaborative relationship with professionals in the Washington DC VA Medical Center working in the area of PTSD. Potential pa rticipants who had a diagnosis of PTSD and/or a history of trauma were recruited from the Washington DC VA Medical Center for participation in the study. Following pre -screening and informed consent, participants were evaluated by a clinician for the pres ence of PTSD and co -morbid psychiatric conditions and other inclusion and exclusion criteria. Twenty -one eligible female and male participants were randomized to one of two groups: 1) CPT for 12 weeks; or 2) MBSR class for 8 weeks (MBSR). Participants we re evaluated at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks for post -traumatic stress disorder, psychological distress, coping self -efficacy, working memory, pain symptoms, sleep quality and mindfulness. Dr. Dempsey served as the Co-Investigator and treatment intervent ionist while she was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Washington DC VA working closely with the hospital staff to launch this study. Dr. Dempsey is now a Research Psychologist at the Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress in the Department of Psychiatry and is overseeing the project to ensure the completion of data collection, data analyses and begin publication preparation. Data collection , which began in June 2011 , is now complete. In general , the participants responded favorably to the study as an uniq ue opportunity to get access to alternative forms of treatments for PTSD, not currently available at the VA Medical Center. A total of 102 participants were recruited to participa te in the pre -screening process. Out of the 102 participants contacted, 61 p atients completed the prescreening process and 41 completed the baseline assessments. These participants completed the full battery of assessments including the SCID to rule out inclusion/exclusion criteria, the CAPS to assess PTSD, and self-report measure s to assess sleep quality, psychological distress, depressive symptoms and mindfulness. 21 of these patients met eligibility criteria and we re randomized to CPT or MBSR. The first cohort of CPT began June 8, 2011, followed by the second and third cohorts in Jan uary 2012. The group participants completed baseline, week 4, week 8, and week 12 assessments. An unanticipated finding in this study was the high number of patients who did not meet criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD. The diagnosis of PTSD is compl ex and includes a thorough review of the patients' trauma history and accurate assessment of avoidance, arousal and re -experiencing symptoms. These findings may have implications for future assessment procedures and the use of more stringent gold standard methods in VA settings. Dr. Dempsey is overseeing analyses and manuscript preparation . 21 Theme: Addiction Treatment of Cocaine Addict ion with Integrative Meditation PI: Kevin Chen, PhD This (R21) grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, at the NIH is a therapy development study, based on a previous observational study. The specific aims are: (1) To conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of 66 outpatient cocaine users with 12 weekly facilitation meetings to assess feasibility of recruiting and retaining cocaine addicts, and to determine effect size of IM -augmented treatment in comparison with non -directive therapy (NT) control, with both groups receiving standard \"treatment as usual \" (TAU); and (2) To e xamine the changes in attention network s and negative mood as possible mediators of treatment outcomes between the two groups. Treatment outcomes were assessed at baseline, week 4, 8 and 12, and at the fo llow-up 3 months after intervention. Primary outcomes include cocaine urine tox icology, number of weeks in treatment, and intensity of cocaine use. Seco ndary outcome measures include Addiction Severity Index (ASI) composite scores, use of alcohol and other drugs, heart rate variability, cra ving, depression, anxiety, and self -efficacy. Addit ional measures were proposed to aid in understanding poss ible underlying mechanisms of IM's effect on attention networks and the autonomic nervous system. A diverse team experienced in med itation and behavior therapy development conduct ed the proposed R21 project, and is preparing for a full therapy develo pment study. The following study activities have been conducted with the support of the R21 grant thus far: (1) Completion of the planned recruitment of 66 subjects of cocaine addiction and their follow -ups: We have screened a total of 121 to enroll 66 qualified participants, among them, 31 completed the 12 weeks of study and 3 months follow -up, 11 completed 12 weeks of study, and wait for 3 -month follow -up, 24 dropped out of study due to different reas ons. (2) We have completed data entry and in the process of final data analysis. We anticipate that the final report to NIH will be comp leted in the next two months. Integrative Meditation for the Treatment of Co -occurring Anxiety Disorders among Heroin - Dependent Patients - a Randomized Controlled Study to Est ablish Feasibility and Efficacy PI: Kevin Chen, PhD This Independent Investigator Award from the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression (NARSAD) is supporting a therapy devel opment study to investigate feasibi lity and efficacy of adding breathing -based Integrative Meditation (IM) to a methadone program to help patients with anxiety disorders (AD) to develop skills in coping with stress/anxiety, reduce anxiety sensitivity, and improve overall treatment outcomes. The specific aims of the study include: 1) Investigate the therapeutic effects of adding IM to methadone treatment to reduce anxiety disorders and related symptoms through a randomized control trial; 2) explore the be neficial effect of IM on overall treatment outcomes, such as prevalence of benzodiazepine ( BZN) or heroin use at the end of study and at 6 months follow -up, and treatment completion rate; 3) examine the changes in heart rate variability and saliva cortisol level as the possible mechanism for the above AD and substance use outcomes. This is the final year of the project (in no -cost extension). After successful recruitment of 10 participants into the open trial without control (the first step of the therapy development study ), we have successfully 22 recruited 36 participants into the pilot randomized control trial - 20 participants are in IM group and 16 in supportive counseling (SC) control. . A total of 23 participants successfully completed the 12 -week study and some completed the 3-month follow -up, and 12 dropped out during the study (two were administratively discharged) . We are in the final stage of data cleaning and data analysis, and will have the final report for this study soon. A preliminary data analy sis shows that, in comparison with those in SC control, the patients in IM group reported more reduction in number of anxiety disorders (from average of 3.2 at baseline to 1.6 disorders after 12 weeks of treatment; for SC group, it was 3.1 to 2.6 correspon dingly), and significantly more reduction in level of anxiety state ( -12.5 vs. -.0.6; p < .05). Theme: Cancer A Randomized Controlled Trial Assessing the Effect of Acupuncture in Reducing Aromatase Inhibitor Associated Musculoskeletal Symptoms (AIMSS) PI: Ting Bao, MD, Co -PI: Vered Stearns, MD (JHH) This is a dual center (University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center and Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center) randomized, placebo -controlled trial to evaluate the e ffect of acupuncture on AIMSS, menopausal symptoms, and quality of life in breast cancer patients. We will randomly assign 100 women suffering from AIMSS to 8 weekly sessions of acupuncture or sham acupuncture. We will use health assessment questionnaire disability index (HAQ -DI) to assess clinical musculoskeletal disorder severity at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12. Change in HAQ -DI score will be compared between women on Aromatase Inhibitors ( AIs) receiving acupuncture versus sham acupuncture (Aim1). At weeks 0 , 4, 8, and 12, patients will complete menopausal symptom and quality of life questionnaires to compare differences between patients receiving acupuncture versus sham acupuncture (Aim2). Serum estrogen and beta endorphin concentrations and cytokine profil e will be measured before and after treatment to evaluate the etiology of AIMSS and the mechanism of acupuncture in treating AIMSS (Aim3). The study was launched in May 2008 and completed in July 2011. Statistically significant reduction of IL- 17 (P 0.009) was observed in both groups after 8 weekly treatments with no significant intergroup difference. IL-17 (interleukin -17) is a cell that promotes inflammation. We did not observe significantly different response to real versus sham acup uncture after 8 weekly treatments. Sham acupuncture used in this study may not be equivalent to placebo. The results have been published in Breast Cancer Research and Treatment in February 2013 . A pilot study to evaluate the efficacy and explore the mechanism of acupuncture in treating bortezomib -induced peripheral neuropathy (BIPN) in multiple myeloma patients PI: Ting Bao, MD, Co -PI: Ashraf Badros, MD This is a single -center, one treatment arm clinical trial assessing the efficacy, feasibility and safety of acupuncture in reducing the severity of bortezomib -induced peripheral neuropathy (BIPN) in multiple myeloma patients. The study was launched in May 2011 and completed in May 2012. Twenty -seven patients were enrolled and 25 were evaluable. There were no adverse events associated with the acupuncture treatment. Fourteen (56%) patients reported improved daily functions (e.g. walking and coordination). Ten patients (40%) reported > 50% decrease in average NPS during treatment (week 1 -10). Seven pa tients reported 50% reduction in FACT/GOG -Ntx total scores. The decrease in NPS and FACT/GOG -Ntx, was statistically significant between baseline assessments through w eek 14; p -values are 0.001 and <0.0001, respectively. On the other hand, TNSc scores, an o bjective clinical assessment, did not significantly change. Of 15 patients who had nerve conduction studies, 5 showed >10% increase in motor 23 nerve amplitude. At week 8, one of the measured cytokines: Brain -Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) significantly increased from baseline (p=0.043). We are in the process of finalizing the manuscript before submitting it to a peer -reviewed medical journal. Using the data generated from this study, we have been awarded an R21 grant to study the effect of using acupunc ture during chemotherapy to prevent chemotherapy dose reduction in February 2013. Acupuncture to Prevent Chemotherapy Dose Reduction Due to Chemotherapy -induced Peripheral Neuropathy in Breast and Colorectal Cancer Patients PI: Ting Bao, MD In this st udy, funded by an NCI R21 grant awar ded in February 2013, Dr. Ting Bao and colleagues will conduct a single -center, pilot (phase IIb), randomized, standard care - and placebo (sham acupuncture) - controlled clinical trial (N=60) assessing the effects of acupu ncture to prevent chemotherapy dose reduction due to chemotherapy -induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) and to elucidate the mechanism of action . To-date, 10 patients have been screened and 1 patient has been randomized. A pilot randomized controlled tria l to evaluate the efficacy and explore the mechanism of acupuncture in reducing the severity of chemoradiation -induced mucositis in pat ients with oropharyngeal cancer PI: Ting Bao, MD In this study, funded by a K12 grant, Dr. Ting Bao and colleagues will conduct a single -center, randomized controlled pilot clinical trial (n=20) assessing the efficacy, feasibility and safety of acupuncture in reducing the severity of chemoradiation -induced oral mucositis in patients with oropharyngeal cancer. Patient enrollment began in February 2013 and 2 patients have been enrolled to -date. Theme: Depression Conventional vs. Spiritually Integrated Psychotherapy for Major Depression in Patients with Chronic Illness PI: Harold Koenig, PhD Dr. Michelle Pearce is servi ng as a co -investigator, treatment developer, and intervention supervisor for a multi -site pilot study investigating religious psychotherapy for major depression in patients with chronic illness. The principle investigator is Dr. Harold Koenig of Duke Univ ersity Medical Center. This study has been funded by John Templeton Foundation ($1.5 million). Summary : This grant involves preparing for and conducting a randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing the effectiveness of conventional (CCBT) vs. religious co gnitive behavioral therapy (RCBT) for major depression in medical patients with chronic illness. This project is the initial first step in developing a research program and bringing together a team of investigators capable of conducting future studies t o uncover the biological mechanisms that explain why religion affects physical health and longevity. Our target here is depression - a prototype disorder that is (1) widespread, (2) causes tremendous functional disability, (3) produces adverse immune and endocrine changes with clinical implications, (4) has genetic roots, and (5) is influenced both in its development and course by religious involvement. 24 Major depression is a common, painful, physically impairing, and financially costly illness with a life time prevalence of nearly 15%, the world's second most disabling condition (behind heart disease). Depression has negative effects on physical health and medical outcomes by destroying the motivation necessary to recover and by adversely affecting vital i mmune and endocrine functions. Religion is widely prevalent and often turned to as a coping behavior in response to stressors related to physical illness, disability, and loss. A psychological therapy that takes advantage of patients' religious resources ought to improve depression more quickly than one that ignores them, and be more effective in reversing depression -induced physiological changes. Duke University Medical Center, in partnership with University of London and Innovative Healthcare Research Consortium (consulting with California Clinical Trials) propose a randomized clinical trial of conventional cognitive behavior therapy (CCBT) vs. religious cognitive behavior therapy (RCBT) for major depression in medical patients with chronic disabling il lness. Therapists delivered the treatment either (1) in real time over the Internet, (2) by Skype, and/or (3) by telephone. The study is taking place at two sites, central North Carolina (Duke) and Los Angeles County (Glendale Adventist Medical Center).I n Phase I, we conducted an open trial of 30 patients to assess subject recruitment, develop & refine treatment manuals (Christian, Jewish, Hindu, Buddhist, and Muslim versions), assess compliance with and acceptability of treatment, and identify the best d elivery system, as well as give therapists experience in that delivery system. In Phase II, we conducted a randomized proof of concept comparison of CCBT vs. RCBT that demonstrates the feasibility of the study and will test the expected clinically meani ngful difference in preparation to develop a definitive NIH application. In Phase II, 70 patients were randomized to receive ten 50 min sessions delivered over 12 weeks of either CCBT or RCBT. Four therapists delivered the CCBT intervention over the tele phone and four different therapists delivered the RCT intervention. We are currently finishing the intervention with the last five patients. The primary endpoint will be BDI score at baseline, 4, 8, 12, and 24 -week follow -up. Of particular importance, we will examine the effects of genetic variation at candidate genes (serotonin transporter, 5 - HT1A receptor, and monoamine oxidase A promoter) on treatment response, and compare the effects of RCBT vs. CCBT on endocrine and immune measures in blood and urine . Dr. Pearce developed the RCBT intervention and wrote the treatment manuals (therapist manual and patient workbook). She also hired and trained the four RCBT therapists and provides them with ongoing formal supervision. Theme: Wellness UMB Wellness Hub collaboration and research evaluation PI: Delia Chiaramonte, MD, Co -PI: Chris D'Adamo, PhD Drs. Delia Chiaramonte and Chris D'Adamo have initiated multiple avenues of collaboration with leaders of the UMB Wellness Hub, a campus -wide initiative offe ring programs to enhance eight dimensions of wellness (physical, emotional, social, intellectual, financial, environmental, cultural and ethical) with headquarters in the UMB Campus Center. Current collaborative efforts include: provision of health and wellness lectures to faculty, staff, and students in the UMB Wellness Hub central conference rooms; creation of Center for Integrative Medicine office space within the UMB Wellness Hub for education of students throughout the seven UMB graduate and professio nal schools; providing free services within our 25 respective areas of expertise to graduate students. Dr. D'Adamo has been providing personalized nutritional counseling to a number of students in the Schools of Law and Medicine and has been commended for thi s service. Additionally, Dr. Michelle Pearce, who joined our team in August 2012, offers student counseling two days a week at the UMB Wellness Hub. A new 4 -week experiential stress management program was developed by Drs. Chiaramonte and Kevin Chen. Th e program (see Positive Mindset Training for Stress Management among Graduate Students below) incorporates elements of mindfulness, meditation, cognitive behavioral therapy, and positive psychology. It was pilot tested in the spring of 2012 with health pr ofessional graduate students. After a successful test run, with overwhelmingly positive feedback, we plan to test the program in larger populations , including UM nursing administration . Drs. Chiaramonte and D'Adamo also constructed a survey to assess stu dent health and wellness outcomes associated with usage of the services provided by the UMB Wellness Hub. This survey has been pilot - tested in a group of medical students . Visiting Professor Dr. Claudia Witt is assisting with the development of a revised wellness assessment and we intend to administer the new instrument to all incoming graduate students in the future . Collecting this data will allow us to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the UMB Wellness program and to provide specific input to optimi ze the success of future program offerings. Positive Mindset Training for Stress Management among Graduate Students PI: Kevin W Chen, PhD, Co-PI: Delia C hiaramonte, MD 80% of all visits to primary care physicians can be attributed to stress -related cause s. Additionally , stress significantly and negatively affect s quality of life and job efficacy. Effective stress management may be the most efficient way to minimize health p roblems, reduce healthcare cost, increase work efficiency , and increase general w ell-being. Unfortunately, stress management methods are not \"one size fits all\" and not everyone who needs stress management has or will make the time to practice stress management skills. As a possible solution, Drs. Chen and Chiaramonte have worked tog ether to modify our existing 12 -week Integrative Meditation (IM) program into a 4 -week Positive Mindset Training (PMT) for stress management . We advertise it thusly: \" This positive and mindful approach integrates three most effective stress management techniques - mindfulness, positivity and detachment - into one simplified and flexible training, focusing on a positive and detached mindset, with some easy -to-apply daily exercises. Hopefully everyone can find something useful and meaningful from this simp le, short and portable training, and lead a happier and relaxing life. After all, stress is not what happens to us, but how we choose to respond to what happens - we can choose the response wisely. \" We offered BBMT to graduate level students at UMB in the Spring of 2012 and 2013 . In the first study, fourteen students volunteered to participate in the pilot program, and were randomized into either mindfulness training group or waiting -list control ( n=7 each group). Twelve (12) students completed the 4 - week PMT (2 dropped out, one in each group). After the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease in anxiety state was reported by the PMT group (from 36.3 to 31.8, p < .05), while a slight increase was observed in the control group (from 36.0 to 39.5). No signi ficant changes were found in perceived stress or anxiety trait in either group. The MAAS m indfulness score (Brown & Ryan, 2003) demonstrated an increased trend from 57.3 to 62.3 in the PMT group (p = 0.07) while no change was noted in the control group (fr om 45.0 to 45.7), suggesting the usefulness of PMT in facilitating mindfulness. We also tested the feasibility of collecting saliva samples to assess cortisol levels. Eight of the 12 students provided quality saliva samples before and after the interventi on. Both groups reported marginally significant reduction in salivary cortisol during the study period, however no significant group difference was observed. All students offered highly 26 positive feedback about the PMT program and suggested that it should be offered to the general student body. In the second study, seven (7) students and two (2) visiting scholars volunteered to participate. Of the nine participants, seven (7) completed the training (two did not make it to the final session due to travel). Results are currently being analyzed, but preliminary results look positive. Theme: Nutrition An Educational Intervention Focusing upon Spices and Herbs to Improve Diet Quality among Baltimore City High School Students PI: Chris D'Adamo, PhD Dr. D'Adam o is the Principal Investigator on a six -week educational intervention comparing the impact of a spices and herbs educational intervention to standard nutrition education on the diet quality of high school students in Baltimore. This study wa s funded by t he McCormick Science Institute and was completed in June. Background and Rationale: Childhood and adolescent obesity is increasing at an alarming rate in the United States. Since 1980, the prevalence of obesity has doubled among children and more than trip led among adolescents as reflected in National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) data. Further compounding the public health urgency of childhood and adolescent obesity is the fact that minority youth populations appear to be disproportiona tely affected. In particular, NHANES data revealed that African American adolescents were considerably more likely to be overweight (21%) and obese (19%) than Caucasian adolescents (14% overweight and 17% obese). This discrepancy is likely due to both socioeconomic and cultural factors, a combination which has limited the success of many interventions. The immediate and long -term repercussions of childhood and adolescent obesity are profound. 70% of obese children were found to possess at least one cardiova scular disease risk factor and 39% demonstrated two or more risk factors. Another large study revealed that obese children were at greatly increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Obese children and adolescents are also more likely to experience social and psych ological problems, such as discrimination and low self -esteem, which have been shown to continue into adulthood. A related and highly disconcerting trend evident throughout the literature is that obese children are more likely to become obese adults. Adult obesity is a major risk factor for many chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, and some cancers. In light of the many adverse consequences associated with childhood and adolescent obesity, the causes driving this epidemic in crease are an area of critical concern and substantial study across disciplines. It has become clear that childhood obesity is a multi -factorial problem. Decreased physical activity, greater availability and media exposure to calorically -dense and nutrient -sparse foods, increased consumption of sugary drinks and sodas, and limited access and exposure to healthy and affordable foods are all contributing to the rapid increase in childhood and adolescent obesity. Many of these contributing factors are either o ccurring in or are exacerbated by environmental challenges and deleterious choices made during school. The elimination of physical education class, reduction of physical activity time during recess, suboptimal school lunch programs, unhealthy food and beve rage options in vending machines, and a lack of basic nutrition education in schools are all thought to be modifiable risk factors for childhood and adolescent obesity. Poor dietary habits among high school students appear to be a particularly powerful risk factor for adolescent obesity. In fact, recent work conducted by the Centers for Disease Control revealed that high school students consumed only 1.2 combined servings of fruits and vegetables per day, 27 falling far short of the 5 daily servings recommende d by the USDA. While environmental and core educational curriculum changes are primarily driven at the policy level, teaching students how to improve their diets is a powerful and cost -effective tool in reducing the risk of childhood and adolescent obesity . Capitalizing upon the existing relationships established in Baltimore City Public Schools through The Institute for Integrative Health's \"BMore BWell\" community health program, t he six -week study is a two -arm community intervention designed to evaluate the effects of a spices and herbs educational intervention on the diet quality of high school students in Baltimore. Spices and herbs are believed to be valuable vehicles to improve diet quality for a number of reasons. The vast variety of culinary spices and herbs enhance the flavor of healthy foods, positively engage the senses through pleasing aromas and colors, encourage dietary diversity through myriad flavor combinations, promote cultural identity through their usage in traditional recipes, and allow creative expression in cooking. The two arms in this intervention are 1.) Control Group receivin g standard nutrition instruction in the tenets of the USDA Food Pyramid at baseline but no further required nutritional education during the six -week study per iod (conducted at Patterson High School) and 2.) Spices and Herbs Education Group receiving basic instruction in the tenets of the USDA Food pyramid as well as six weekly, mandatory sessions of experiential and didactic nutritional education focused upon h ow to use spices and herbs to improve diet quality (conducted at Baltimore Freedom Academy). If determined to be more successful than standard nutritional education in improving the diet quality of high school students, this highly -replicable spices and he rbs educational program could be implemented in schools across the country. Results: The spices and herbs educational intervention was determined to be feasible and effective among high school students in Baltimore. Over 90% of students were compliant wit h the requirements of the intervention and participants who received the spices and herbs education increased their intake of protein and whole grains more than participants who received the standard nutrition education (p<0.05). In addition, participants who received the spices and herbs education also expressed improved attitudes towards healthy eating compared to participants who received the standard nutrition education (p<0.05). These findings carry substantial public health implications as few other i nterventions to date have shown the ability to improve diet and attitudes about healthy eating among high school students in urban areas. Accordingly, the manuscript describing the nutritional education intervention and results of the study will be submitt ed to American Journal of Clinical Nutrition ; the top peer -reviewed journal in the field of nutrition. Genetic Predictors of Plasma Micronutrient Concentrations PI: Chris D'Adamo, PhD Dr. D'Adamo is leading an analysis of the genetic predictors of a wide variety of micronutrients important to human health. This work is funded by the Mid-Atlantic Nutrition and Obesity Research Center and National Institutes of Health - National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). Background a nd Rationale: High serum concentrations of micronutrients have been shown to be protective against a wide variety of chronic diseases; including cancer, cardiovascular disease, macular degeneration, glaucoma, and many others. Micronutrient concentrations c an be increased through the regular intake of fruits, vegetables, and other nutrient -dense foods, but serum concentrations in response to such healthy diets vary considerably between individuals. Genetic factors are thought to have a major influence on thi s highly variable individual response to dietary intake. However, genetic predictors of serum concentrations of the carotenoids and vitamin E, two of the most biologically active and thoroughly studied classes of dietary antioxidants, remain largely unexpl ored. One small analysis of genetic predictors of vitamin E and the carotenoids identified some potential targets (SNPs on apo A -IV, apo B, etc.) that we are currently validating in a much larger sample using more current analytical methods. These findings could 28 have important implications with reference to identifying individuals at risk for deficiencies in these health - protective micronutrients. Results: A number of genetic predictors of concentrations of these important micronutrients were identified in this study. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) predicted concentrations of the following micronutrients: 1.) Alpha -carotene : rs10987402, p=4.07E -08, located on LMX1 gene. This micronutrient and gene are known to play a role in glaucoma. 2.) Lycopen e: rs7680948, p=3.41E -09, located on SETD7 gene. This micronutrient and gene are known to play a role in inflammation, heart disease, and diabetes. Collectively, these findings contribute to the advancement of personalized nutrition for the prevention an d treatment of chronic disease. Chronic toxicity of ginseng CMCs in male and female rats Co-PIs: Ruixin Zhan g, PhD and Lixing Lao , PhD Funded by Unhwa Corporation, th e objective of this study was to analyze the chronic toxicity of ginseng CMCs in the ra t subject. For the chronic toxicity, male and female rats were respectively divided into four groups (n=10 per group) of Vehicle (water), 0.3, 0.6 and 1g ginseng CMCs. The animals were kept under controlled environmental conditions (24\u00b0C \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C relative humidity 50 -60%, 7am to 7pm alternate light -dark cycles, food and water ad libitum). The animal protocol was approved by the institutional animal care and use committees of the University of Maryland School of Medicine (USA). Blood sample (0.2 ml) was co llected in each rat from a tail vein before feeding ginseng CMCs. Five days later, ginseng CMCs, dissolved in distilled water, was given orally once a day for 6 months. The rats were weighed once a week. All the animals were closely monitored for adverse b ehavioral changes including loss of appetite, diarrhea, weight loss, fur discoloration, sedation, irritation, and convulsion. Animal toxicities/adverse effects were quantified by assessing blood chemistry at baseline and at the end of the experiment. Heart blood was collected at the end of six months and centrifuged (1310 g) for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. The plasma was collected and stored at -80\u00b0C until biochemistry tests were conducted. The data were summarized as follow: 1) blood chemistry test, 2) histology, 3) bo dy weight, and 4) behavior. Results : 1. The following fourteen chemicals have been measured by IDEXX laboratories, Inc. (Westbrook, Maine USA) nitrogen (BUN), Uric acid, Triglycerine and cholesterol. The data showed no significant changes of most of these chemicals betw een baseline and after 6 -month CMC treatment. There was a significant increase of triglyceride in both water and CMC -treated rats at 6 months compared to the baseline, indicating this increase is not a specific changes induced by CMCs. CMCs at 1g but not 0 .3-0.6g results in significant increase of BUN compared to baseline. 2. There were no abnormal histological changes in heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney. 3. Body weight normal grow th during experiment. 29 4. There was no abnormal behavior observed duri ng experiment. The Impact of a Mushroom Supplement on Incidence, Frequency, & Duration of the Common Cold PI: Chris D'Adamo, PhD Dr. D'Adamo is the Principal Investigator on a randomized, placebo -controlled clinical trial of a mushroom - based dietary supp lement on the incidence, frequency, and duration of the common cold. This work is funded by Nutramax Laboratories. The common cold is one of the most prevalent illnesses and leading causes of acute morbidity among otherwise healthy a dults. Americans exp erience an estimated 1 billion cases of the common cold annually, with the average person experiencing between two to six colds per year. While the symptoms are rarely serious, the common cold results in 22 million clinician visits per year. The typical co nstellation of symptoms can persist for up to two weeks and includes nasal congestion, scratchy or sore throat, headache, and cough. The common cold causes considerable suffering and results in over 148 million days of severely restricted activity for Amer icans per year. These limitations in daily activities incur a substantial public health and socioeconomic burden. The common cold accounts for 20 million days of missed work, 22 million days of missed school, and approximately $17 billion in expenditures f or physician visits. In total, the indirect and direct costs of the common cold are thought to exceed $40 billion per year. Pharmacological options for both the prophylaxis and treatment of the common cold are currently limited. Less than 5% of common co ld cases are of bacterial etiology, yet antibiotics are still often prescribed despite lack of efficacy and expansive side effects. Most common colds are of viral etiology, with rhinovirus, adenoviruses, and corona viruses causing the majority of cases. Th erefore, enhancing the immune system's capacity to prevent infection and replication of these viruses may be the most effective means to reduce the incidence, duration, and severity of the common cold. A number of natural products have demonstrated the abi lity to both prevent and treat the common cold. Specific micronutrients (zinc gluconate), herbs plantarum ) have been shown to be effective against the common cold and are consequently among the mo st popular nutritional supplements today. Certain foods also have a history of traditional usage and an emerging body of scientific research supporting their ability to combat viruses, perhaps most notably mushrooms. Shiitake are two of the most thoroughly studied mushrooms, both of which have been shown to possess profound immunomodulating properties. These mushrooms have been used extensively for their anti -viral properties in traditional medical systems and the specific mechanisms through which Shiitake and Maitake mushrooms el icit these properties have become more clear in recent decades. The polysaccharide - and -glucans in Shiitake mushrooms are known to enhance immune activity in animal models. Activated Hexose Correlated Compound (AHCC) is an extract of Shiitake mushroom that is rich in -1,4 glucans and it has been shown to positively impact the human immune system and improve response to influenza virus in animal models. This preliminary evidence, in combination with Phase I clinical trials supporting its safety in huma ns, suggests that a human trial assessing the impact of AHCC in preventing the common cold and ameliorating its symptoms is warranted. However, while the high -glucan content of AHCC holds promise as a single protective agent, the - glucans in many other mushroom species may also provide additional protection against the common cold. The 1,3 D -glucans in Maitake mushrooms, in particular, have potent immunostimulatory properties that may contribute to the defense against infection and replication of commo n cold viruses. As such, our study aims to evaluate whether daily consumption of a unique combination of Shiitake and Maitake mushroom extracts would reduce the incidence, severity, and duration of the common cold virus. 30 Theme: Exercise A Supervised Exe rcise Program for Lyme Disease PI: Chris D'Adamo, PhD Dr. D'Adamo is serving as the Principal Investigator on a pilot study of a supervised exercise program for patients suffering from persistent symptoms of Lyme Disease. This study was funded by a privat e donor and was completed in April. Background and Rationale: The incidence of Lyme disease in the United States is increasing rapidly. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) surveillance figures reveal that state health departments reported 9,908 cases of Lym e in 1992 and 19,931 cases in 2006; an increase of over 100% during this period. The CDC has also stated that the actual number of Lyme disease cases may be 10 -12 times greater than what has been reported. Many patients who are diagnosed with Lyme disease experience a variety of persistent symptoms including fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and neurological disturbances. The National Institutes of Health have deemed this persistent constellation of symptoms post -Lyme disease syndrome (PLDS). The Internationa l Lyme and Associated Disease Society, an international medical society dedicated to the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of Lyme and its associated diseases. calls this condition chronic Lyme disease (CLD). While treatment options for PLDS/CLD are curr ently limited, exercise is believed to play a key role in the recovery and remission of patients suffering from PLDS/CLD. However, no forms of exercise have been rigorously evaluated as a treatment option for PLDS patients. Consequently, there is limited information available to PLDS/CLD patients with reference to the optimal type, frequency, and duration of exercise that many believe can ameliorate symptoms. As such, PLDS/CLD patients often experience highly variable levels of adherence and results with ex ercise. This study aimed to identify if it is feasible for PLDS/CLD patients to adhere to a supervised, low -intensity, resistance exercise program. Further, we are seeking to determine whether resistance exercise may lead to an amelioration of PLDS/CLD as expressed by a symptom -assessment instrument commonly employed in clinical practice. The results of this study will help to establish a context for optimal exercise participation among the growing number of PLDS/CLD patients. Results: The exercise interve ntion was determined to be feasible and effective at managing the symptoms of PLDS/CLD. All participants in this pilot study completed the intervention and were able to perform the supervised exercise despite suffering from debilitating symptoms. Improveme nts were noted in exercise capacity and many symptoms of the disease. The manuscript detailing the findings is currently under composition and will be submitted to BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine . Clinical Outcomes Research Bravewell Collabor ative Clinical Network, BraveNet, and PRIMIER Study Our participation in the Bravewell Collaborative continued over the past year in two areas. The Bravewell Collaborative Clinical Network is a consortium of nine leading integrative medicine clinics tha t meet by telephone monthly and in person semi -annually to share insights and resources in integrative patient care, clinic management, and research in order to promote leading edge practices in integrative medicine. Six of the nine centers are at academi c medical centers; while the latest addition was a community clinic in Venice, California demonstrating that integrative medicine can be expanded throughout the healthcare system. 31 Under the guidance of the CIM, the Bravewell Collaborative formed a Practi ce-Based Research Network (PBRN). Named BraveNet, the research network combines the nine clinical network integrative medicine centers into one large collaborative research resource, which will help to advance integrative medicine by providing clinical us e, clinical outcomes and cost benefit data previously not available to the medical and scientific communities. The first project of BraveNet was to survey 4,000 patients across the country (500 in each of the original eight clinics) with data from the ni nth clinic added for further analysis. These data provided an estimate of our combined patient sample population, established the number and range of medical conditions encountered in our respective practices, and surveyed the variety of integrative medic ine treatments provided. Across the board, improving wellness and prevention of future problems were the most common reasons given, even among patients with seriou s illness. This manuscript was published in Explore . The second project of BraveNet was a p rospective outcome study of patients with chronic pain treated by integrative medicine, Study on Integrative Medicine Treatment Approaches for Pain (SIMTAP). A total of 400 patients were enrolled in the collective BraveNet centers and followed through tre atment in the clinics. Patients received individualized interventions provided at each BraveNet center and were assessed at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 weeks to assess outcomes of pain, psychological well -being, as well as physiological and inflammatory measure s of vitamin D level and C -reactive protein. Data analysis revealed consistent improvements in measures of both pain and depression across the study period. The manuscript was published in BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine . In May 2013, CIM join ed the Patients Receiving Integrative Medicine Interventions Registry (PRIMIER) integrative medicine clinical data registry. PRIMIER will collect longitudinal outcomes data on all patients seen in the Brave Net and select other integrative medicine clinics that participated in the Bravewell Mapping Survey. A web -based instrument will be utilized to collect a standard database to better understand the patient experience at integrative medicine clinics. Participants will be asked to complete on - line questionna ires at a baseline visit, every 2 months up to the 6th month, and then every 6 months thereafter. Web -based data collection will begin with patients using tablet computers in the clinic waiting area using the PROMIS instrument developed by NIH to create a more uniform data set across multiple studies. Funding for this study has been committed to CIM by the Bravewell Collaborative and data collection is anticipated to begin in early 2014. Other Research Projects and Collaborations Integrative Medicine Pro gram for Preventive Medicine Residency Co-Investigators: Delia Chiaramonte, MD and Chris D'Adamo, PhD Drs. Chiaramonte and D'Adamo are serving as co-investigators on the implementation and evaluation of an Integrative Medicine Program for the Preventive Medicine Residency at the University of Maryland School of Medicine . This program and study have been funded by the Health Resources Services Administration (HRSA) . Background and rationale: Integrative medicine can be defined as a practice of medicine th at takes into account the whole person (body, mind, and spirit), addresses all aspects of lifestyle, and emphasizes the therapeutic relationship. It incorporates both conventional and complementary approaches to care and makes use of the best -available evi dence, with the ultimate goal being the health and wellness of the 32 individual. Integrative medicine is a growing specialty, and use of complementary and alternative medicine has been substantially increasing. On the other hand, Preventive Medicine is a m edical specialty dedicated to disease prevention and health promotion, at both the individual and population levels. Its goal is to protect, promote, and maintain health and wellness; goals that are closely aligned with those of Integrative Medicine. Unt il now, preventive medicine residency training focused mostly on conventional medicine. The University of Maryland has a dedicated Center for Integrative Medicine (CIM) that was founded in 1991 and the first of its kind in the United States. As a Nationa l Institutes of Health Center of Excellence for research in complementary medicine, the CIM is a leading center for research, patient care, education and training in integrative medicine. Indeed, it has a Director of Education and inter -professional facul ty who teach an array of topics to medical students and fellows, in addition to an active integrative medicine clinic. The Preventive Medicine Residency (PMR) at University of Maryland is a well -established program with a long history (since 1965) of trai ning high -quality physicians in General Preventive Medicine and Public Health. It is located in the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health (DEPH) where a multidisciplinary team is dedicated to improving the health of the public by training students and health professionals, conducting basic and clinical research, and serving as a resource to the university, the state, and the broader community. Considering the common goals of these two unique specialties, and the gap in knowledge among preventive medicine specialists with respect to complementary and alternative medicine, this program and implementation has drawn upon experts from both entities to develop a unique integrative medicine curriculum and incorporate it into the preventive medicine resid ency training. Progress: The Integrative Medicine Program has been successfully implemented within the Preventive Medicine Residency. A series of lectures, workshops, retreats, and mentoring opportunities have been offered to the Preventive Medicine resid ents. Data have been collected and will be analyzed and reported the end of the year. A Pilot Study of the Effects of a Therapeutic Music Program in the Greenebaum Cancer Center. PI: Chris D'Adamo, PhD Dr. D'Adamo is serving as the Principal Investigato r on a pilot study evaluating the effects of a therapeutic music program on the pain, anxiety, and quality of life of cancer patients in the University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center. This study has been funded by Gabrielle's Angel Foundation. Backg round and Rationale: Music and sound have been utilized throughout history to alleviate physical, mental, and emotional pain. It has been hypothesized that the vibrations created by live music may promote healing through sympathetic resonance with the body at its vibratory state. While the mechanisms have not been clearly established, a number of clinical trials have revealed that music therapy is efficacious at reducing pain, anxiety, and nausea among cancer patients. In fact, a recent Cochrane Collaborati on systematic review and meta -analysis of clinical trials of music therapy among people living with cancer uncovered significant reductions in pai n, anxiety, and quality of life . Furthermore, many patients in studies of this nature report that they would d esire music therapy again during a future long -term hospital stay. The feedback received from the music therapy that we have provided in the University of Maryland Medical System has corroborated these findings, as evidenced in part by the testimonial from a patient family member in support of our music therapist (Carol Joy Loeb, BSN, RN) provided below: 33 \"When Carol arrived in the Garden and began playing her harp it was like raindrops falling on parched land... please pass on my heartfelt gratitude to the w onderful staff of the Integrative Care Team... You all are certainly forward thinkers, map makers, if you will, when it comes to treating the whole patient and their families.\" - Lois Anne Smith, Ellicott City, MD The support received from Gabrielle's Ange l Foundation has enable d us to ; 1.) Allow Terri Fevang, a Certified Therapeutic Musician, to bring her music therapy services directly to patients in the Greenebaum Cancer Center, 2.) Enable Dr. Chris D'Adamo, Director of Research at the Center for Integra tive Medicine, to develop a set of outcomes in the areas of pain, anxiety, quality of life, and treatment side effects and evaluate these data. Progress: The therapeutic music program has been approved by the IRB of the Greenebaum Cancer Center. Terri Fev ang will begin providing therapeutic music in July. The outcomes evaluation is planned to begin in September. Future Directions Building on the strength and successes of our research program, we plan to continue our focus on traditional Chinese medicine and mind/body therapies and expand to include other CAM therapies for the treatment of prevalent health disorders. Key to our future goals is continuing to build strategic partnerships with preeminent colleagues at the University of Maryland, including t he Shock Trauma Center, the Heart Center, the Department of Medicine, and the Pain Center at the UM Dental School, as well as other national and international institutions. We are currently working on or have submitted proposals for: Adaptation to Bereav ement Loss Dr. Michelle Pearce submitted a grant proposal entitled \" Improving Adaptation to Loss: A Pilot Grief Intervention \" in response to the University of Maryland Pilot and Exploratory Interdisciplinary Research (IDR) Projects FOA. Notice of the awar d decision is forthcoming. Bereavement is very distressing for many people, challenging assumptions about the self, the world, and religious/spiritual faith. Bereaved individuals are at high risk for physical and psychological health problems, as well as increased risk of mortality and suicide. A central aspect of grieving is the attempt to make sense of or find some greater significance in the death of a loved one using personal constructs about life and the world. This process is called meaning -making. F acilitating meaning -making in bereavement can have short - and long -term beneficial effects on the health and functioning of the bereaved. Directed written emotional disclosure is one way to create meaning out of loss and to facilitate post -traumatic growth , resulting in better bereavement adjustment. Religion/Spirituality (R/S) is another powerful meaning -making resource. Many find solace in their R/S beliefs and use their faith to cope with the death of a loved one; however, some find their faith seriously challenged or eroded as a result of bereavement, leading to even greater bereavement distress. This form of bereavement distress is called complicated spiritual grief and is associated with negative emotional, behavioral, cognitive, and relational changes . Complicated spiritual grief is also associated with Prolonged Grief Disorder, a debilitating, persistent, and sometimes life - threatening form of grief. We address the important clinical problem of how best to support the grief meaning -making process with R/S bereaved individuals, who may find that their faith is a helpful resource or a source of grief and pain. The broad, long -term objective of this collaborative line of research is to 34 develop empirically -validated, theory -driven grief interventions to po sitively impact the bereavement adjustment of individuals following the death of a loved one. The first specific aim for the proposed investigation is to develop and refine a meaning -making intervention to positively influence the bereavement adjustment t rajectory of individuals who have lost a loved one. The second specific aim is to pilot test the acceptability of this intervention, study protocol, and proposed outcome measures (assessing prolonged grief disorder, depression, complicated spiritual grief, meaning - making, and post -traumatic growth) with a sample of self -identified grieving, religious/spiritual bereaved individuals. We will conduct this study with 60 participants using an experimental, randomized, three -group design: intervention, comparison , and control group. All participants will complete four self -disclosure writing tasks over a two -week period; writing tasks will vary by group. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, immediately post -intervention (two weeks), and at three months post -intervention. We hypothesize that bereaved individuals receiving the intervention will have decreased symptoms of prolonged grief disorder, depression, and complicated spiritual grief, and increased sense of meaning and post-traumatic growth. Because this is a pilot study , we will focus on both outcomes and the processes to achieve them with an emphasis on determining barriers, facilitators, and intervention fidelity, to assess feasibility of a larger NIH -funded study. The partnership between faculty in the UMB School of Medicine and UMB School of Nursing will create a synergy in research methods, sample access, resources, and topic expertise that would not be possible should the principal investigators endeavor upon this research individually. Dr. Pearce has b egun the process to collect preliminary data regardless of the funding decision. The IRB application is nearly complete and the surveys have been created using an online assessment software program called Qualtrics. Once IRB approval is issued, recruitment will begin to pilot test the experimental condition. Integrative Medicine in the Inpatient Setting Delia Chiaramonte , MD and Donna Audia, Cowley Shock Trauma Center's full -time Integrative Care nurse, have developed a proposal for a thre e-year pilot project that will create an inpatient integrative medicine consult service in the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center. The service would provide a full range of integrative medicine services to trauma patients and their families to assist with the management of pain, discomfort and anxiety and to facilitate trauma -induced growth. Research priorities would include assessments of pain, anxiety, opiate usage, length of stay and patient satisfaction. An education component would include a required longitudinal curriculum for physicians (Trauma Fellows), nurses and staff. Attention will be given to the wellness of the care team (physicians, nurses and staff) and dedicated integrative wellness sessions will be provided to them. To ensure the succes s of the program, a Director of Inpatient Services has been identified and brought on board - John Reed, M.D., M.Div. See the Inpatient Services section of the Patient Care chapter for more details about the Inpatient Program. Integrative Medicine for Tr aumatic Brain Injury (TBI) CIM is col laborating with the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center at the University of Maryland (which is a member of the US Air Force TBI and PTSD research team) on a program of research to investigate the benefits of providing integrative medicine for brain injury. This research program builds on the on -going projects investigating the effect of acupuncture on post -operative pain and symptoms of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) discussed above in the section, Healing from Tr auma . 35 Our research proposal to the Department of Defense for a randomized, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of early intervention of acupuncture to treat mild TBI (mTBI) symptoms received a very high score but was ultimately not funded as soldiers were not the subjects of the study. Due to the fact that the protocol called for treatment within 24 hours of injury, it was necessary for us to show proof -of-concept by treating patients admitted to Shock Trauma. TBI is a leading cause of de ath and disability in the military. In the current wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, injury survival has improved markedly, with blast -related injuries remaining the most common casualty. While soldiers with severe TBI are evacuated, those with mild TBI (mTBI) often remain in the combat theatre with symptoms. Moreover, there are concerns about potential long-term effects of mTBI including a spectrum of trauma disorders such as depression, anxiety, substance dependence, and post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Evidence also supports the use of acupuncture to treat mTBI symptoms, including anxiety, depression, headaches, body pain, and sleep problems. If the recovery from these key mTBI symptoms can be accelerated by introducing treatment close in time to injury, the military implications could be profound. Acupuncture could be implemented in combat theatre, treating immediate symptoms and preventing their sequelae. Based on these findings, an R21 grant was submitted to NIH/NCCAM. In addition to acupuncture, the Center is developing a new mind -body intervention for mTBI patients that is based on mindfulness -based stress reduction and tailored to issues confronted by patients who have experienced TBI. If shown to be effective in reducing mTBI symptoms, this int ervention could be provided alone, or in combination, with acupuncture. The intervention will be tested in mTBI patients referred by the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center. Many patients seen at the Shock Trauma Center, not only experience mTBI symptoms but report lives characterized by psychological stress, that often pre -dated their injury. Given that mind -body interventions, such as the one under development, have been shown to reduce anxiety, depression, pain and stress, in other patient groups, the Center is interested in investigating the efficacy of the intervention in patients with mTBI. Pain and Inflammation Given the prevalence of co -morbid emotional disorders in patients with pain, the reciprocal effect between persistent pain and mood disord ers is a pressing issue. Our recent studies in animal pain models have shown that electroacupuncture (EA) inhibits the affective dimension of pain, but its mechaniss is unclear . The goal of the future study is to investigate the underlying cellular mechani sms of EA on the affective dimension of pain . As an initial step, we will determine the relevant central neuronal pathway of pain affect using a CPA test and a state -of-the-art optogenetic technique in which single -component microbial light - modulated trans membrane conduction regulators are introduced into targeted cells using cell -specific promoters that allow reliable and accurate in vivo modulation of their activity. Rostral anterior and p -CaMKII, thus indicating that CaMKII - containing neurons are involved i n pain affect. It is still unclear how the activities of CaMKII -containing neurons modulate affective pain. We hypothesize that excitation of these neurons facilitates pain affect and will use the optogenetic techniques to selectively excite and inhibit Ca MKII-containing rACC neurons to evaluate this proposition. \"Integrative Workplace Wellness Solutions\" I nitiative Working closely with Drs. Brian Berman and Delia Chiaramonte, Dr. Chris D'Adamo has been leading the development of a comprehensive wellness program entitled \"Integrative Workplace Wellness Solutions\" to be implemented in a variety of corporate, healthcare, and institutional settings in dire need of enhanced 36 wellness in the workplace. While most corporate wellness programs focus on disease scre ening, cigarette cessation, and basic physical activity promotion, the Center for Integrative Medicine program would provide a much broader set of helpful services including mind -body stress management techniques, novel exercise programs that can be perfor med anywhere, cooking demonstrations and practical nutritional advice that focuses on ensuring success even in the midst of a busy lifestyle, and many other unique features that will teach audiences the practice of true \"self care\". Drs. Berman, Chiaramont e, and D'Adamo have developed curriculums for both corporate wellness assessments and for corporate wellness retreats. An article was featured in the Baltimore Business Journal in July 2012 highlighting this program. As a result, increased interest has b een observed. Integrative Medicine and Addiction Drug abuse continues to be a major public health challenge in the United States. Building on the on -going program of research on addiction at the Center, Dr. Kevin Chen and his colleagues have noted tha t patients in treatment for addiction suffer from co -occurring anxiety disorders and related symptoms, which if not addressed, often undermine therapeutic efforts. Dr. Chen is leading a research effort on two fronts to investigate the application of mind -body medicine into this public health problem. Dr. Chen will continue to build upon pilot study data to investigate the feasibility and primary efficacy of Integrative Meditation (IM) as a treatment for co -occurring anxiety disorders and symptoms relate d to addiction among patients of addiction. Among the treatment outcomes he proposes to evaluate are the prevalence of benzodiazepine or heroin use, as well physiological changes that would be indicative of a reduction in stress and anxiety. Based on the pilot study data, Dr. Chen plans to submit a n R01 grant application to NIH to conduct a behavior therapy development study applying integrative meditation to the treatment of co -occurring anxiety disorders among addition patients. Informatics 37 The goal of the Center for Integrative Medicine's informatics program is to serve as a resource to researchers, clinicians, patients, and healthcare policy makers for high quality information on complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). This goal is accomplished by assembling and systematically reviewing the worldwide scientific literature in CAM. Coordinating Center of the Cochrane Collaboration Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) Field Our primary activities in this area involve acti ng as the Coordinating Center of the Cochrane Collaboration CAM Field. Th is field is an international group of individuals dedicated to facilitating the production of systematic reviews of randomized clinical trials in areas such as acupuncture, massage, chiropractic, herbal medicine, homeopathy , and mind -body therapy. It is a member entity of t he Cochrane Collaboration , a worldwide organization that prepares systematic reviews of all kinds of healthcare therapies, and publishes these reviews in The Cochrane Library . In 200 7, CIM was successful in securing re -funding from the NIH, National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) to support our Cochrane work. This f unding has enabled CIM to: expand and disseminate the CAM Fiel d register of controlled trials increase the number of high qua lity systematic reviews in CAM contribute to training reviewers and promoting international collaboration promote the research pro duced by the Cochrane Collaboration. In 2011, we invested significant time and resources in preparing an application for a second renewal of the Cochrane CAM Field grant. This second renewal application was submitted to NCCAM for the grant application deadline of November 15, 2011. For this second renewal application, we proposed to pursue innovative approaches to further facilitate the development of our trials database and to further the preparation and updating of clinically relevant systematic reviews. The Cochrane CAM Field projects that we proposed in this second renewal application support NCCAM's 2011 -2015 Strategic Plan objectives 3 and 4 (i.e. \"Improve the capacity of the field to carry out rigorous research\" and \"Develop and disseminate objective , evidence -based information on CAM interventions\"). This renewal application received an extremely favorable score and resulted in an award of a $3 million, 5 year grant . CAM Field Register of Controlled Trials We have recently conducted extensive work to enhance the Field's register of controlled clinical trials: First, an important subset of CAM is traditional medicine, defined by the World Health Organization as \"the sum total of knowledge, skills and practices based on the theories, beliefs and exp eriences indigenous to different cultures that are used to maintain health, as well as to prevent, diagnose, improve or treat physical and mental illnesses . Traditional medicine that has been adopted by other populations (outside its indigenous culture) is often termed alternative or complementary medicine.\" Different countries often have their own forms of traditional medicine (e.g., traditional Chinese Medicine, traditional Korean medicine). Because we did not have access to the traditional medicine trial reports that are published in regional or national databases and journals, in 2008 we began contacting Cochrane colleagues and contributors to solicit the contributions of citations of traditional medicine trials published in their regions. This includes contributors from the Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, INFORMATICS 38 who have contributed trials of traditional Chinese medicine; contributors from the Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, who have contributed trials of traditional medicine interventions conduct ed in Korea; contributors from the Japan Society for Oriental Medicine, who have contributed trials of Kampo, a Japanese adaptation of traditional Chinese medicine; and contributors from the South Asian Cochrane Centre, who have contributed trials of Ayurv eda, Unani, and Siddha. Second , the CAM Field works with Dr. Susan Wieland to build, maintain, and submit to The Cochrane Library's Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) the CAM Field specialized register. Dr. Wieland conducts ongoing searches for CAM controlled trials in each issue of CENTRAL, which includes all MEDLINE and EMBASE records of controlled trials as well as records of controlled trials that have been identified and submitted to The Cochrane Library by Cochrane contributors. The specialized register currently includes 45,542 records (as of Issue 6, 2013 of The Cochrane Library ). Third , during the past year, CAM Field faculty have completed a paper about the specialized register of CAM trials , which is currently in press wit h the journal BMC Syst Rev . The first objective of this p aper was to describe the sources and methods for developing the specialized register. The second objective was to analyze the trial citations included in the register, on the following characteristic s: publication dates, languages, publication journals, presence in MEDINE, the type of CAM intervention addressed, and type of medical condition addressed. At the time of analysis [March 2012], the CAM Field trials register included 44,840 citations of CAM -related controlled trials. Most citations (60%) were from 2000 or later, and the majority (71%) were reported in English; the next most common language was Chinese (23%). The journals with the greatest number of citations were CAM journals published in Ch inese, and non-CAM nutrition journals published in English. More than one -third of the register citations (36%) were not indexed in MEDLINE. The most common CAM intervention in the register was non -vitamin, non - mineral natural products (34%), followed by C hinese herbal medicine (27%). There are implications for CAM systematic reviewers of the improved accessibility of these difficult to locate CAM trials : while the register provides access to thousands of difficult to locate trial citations, many of these t rials are of low quality and may overestimate treatment effects ; therefore when including these trials in systematic reviews, adequate analysis of their risk of bias is of utmost importance. Fourth and last , Eric Manheimer and Susan Wieland are actively involved in initiatives to develop and enhance Cochrane -wide registers of clinical trials. Eric Manheimer is a contributor to the Cochrane Information Retrieval Methods Group, and Susan Wieland is an active contributor to the Information Retrieval Methods Group and the Trials Search Coordinators Group. Susan Wieland has also contributed feedback on the development of the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS) , a study -based trials register that is being implemented in 2012 -2013 . The CRS will have a close relat ionship with CENTRAL such that records from within CENTRAL may be grouped within the CRS according to the study of origin . Finally, Eric Manheimer contributes to the development of the state of the art Cochrane - wide methods for searching for studies for sy stematic reviews and trials' databases, as a co -author the 'Searching for Studies' Chapter of the Cochrane Handbook. Mr. Manheimer contributed to a minor update of this Chapter over the past year, and a major update of this 'Searching for Studies' Cochr ane Handbook Chapter is planned for the upcoming year, which Mr. Manheimer and Dr. Wieland will contribute to. Systematic Reviews CIM/Cochrane CAM Field faculty have continued to work on Cochrane and non -Cochrane systematic reviews over the past year. Notably, a systematic review update of acupuncture as an adjuvant to in vitro fertilization 39 (IVF) was published on June 27, 2013, by Human Reproduction Update , which is the highest impact factor journal in the ISI category 'Obstetrics and Gynecology' (1 out of 79 journals). This IVF review, which updates our 2008 BMJ review on this topic, includes 9 new trials and 2,672 new randomized participants. In addition, o ur 2010 Cochrane review of 'Acupuncture for peripheral joint osteoarthritis' has been 'split' into separate Cochrane reviews of hip and knee osteoarthritis . The Cochrane review of acupuncture for hip osteoarthritis was submitted for peer -review in March 2013, and we are currently working on the Cochrane review of acupuncture for knee osteoarthritis. We are also currently working on Cochrane reviews of acupuncture for acute low back pain and acupuncture for chronic low back pain. One of the collaborators on our Cochrane grant, Jianping Liu at the Beijing University of Chinese Medicine , recently completed updates of several Cochrane reviews of Chinese herbal medicine, including reviews of Chinese herbal medicine for uterine fibroids ( published April 2013), HIV/AIDS (completed), irritable bowel syndrome (completed), and viral myocarditis (completed). He has also recently completed 2 new Cochrane reviews, one on 'Chinese medicinal herbs for diabetic nephropathy' and the other on 'Complementary therapies for acne vulgaris' . A new review protocol for 'Chinese herbal medicine for recurrent urinary tract infectio ns in women' was developed, and has been accepted by the Cochrane Renal Group. Database of CAM -related Reviews As an additional element of our effort to make the evidence base on CAM accessible to providers and consumers of CAM, we have continued to refi ne and maintain our CAM Field topics list, the online classification system for CAM -related Cochrane reviews which is publically available on the summaries.c ochrane .org website, on the webpage http://summaries.cochrane.org/search/site/?f[0]=im_field_terms_cochrane_library%3A44450 . The CAM Field topics list on the summaries. cochrane .org website allows viewing of all CAM -related Cochrane reviews in alphabe tical order, by review stage (protocol or completed review), and by topic category. Each review title listed is linked to a Cochrane review abstract and a plain language summary of the review. In order to maintain this list, we download new protocols and reviews from each issue of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews , screen the abstracts of reviews and protocols for CAM content, and then link the new CAM -related reviews to the appropriate category on the topics list. The placement of this list on the summaries.c ochrane .org website, and the multiple options for viewing the list of reviews, are designed to allow persons interested in Cochrane evidence on CAM to identify and access the evidence that is of interest to them. In addition to the summarie s.cochrane .org CAM Field topics list, which is browseable by categories and topics, a simple, alphabetical, regularly updated listing of CAM -related Cochrane reviews and protocols, which numbers 630 completed Cochrane reviews and 282 review protocols (as o f Issue 6, 2013), is posted on the University of Maryland CAM Field website, available at http://www.compmed.umm.edu/cochrane_reviews.asp . We have found the CAM Field topics list to be very v aluable, particularly in promoting and marketing Cochrane CAM -related reviews, and facilitating the accessibility of these reviews. For example, we have received requests from journal editors, governmental organizations, physician groups, and researchers, for lists of all CAM -related Cochrane reviews or lists of reviews of specific CAM topics (e.g., acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine). By preparing and keeping current the topics list, we are able to quickly respond to such requests, providing those who re quest with a reproducible and current list of CAM -related Cochrane reviews, selected using explicit, transparent eligibility criteria. The US National Institutes of Health, National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine now includes prominent l inks to the Cochrane CAM Field topics list on the their 'Research' webpage ( http://nccam.nih.gov/research/ ), results/ ). To further promote the topic s list availability, the Internat ional Society of Complementary and Alternative Medicine and the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine have each now posted a link to the topics list on their websites. 40 Finally, to ensure that reviews relevant to CAM are completed and published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, each year, the CIM/Cochrane CAM Field awards a bursary to Cochrane reviews for which substantial progress has already been made and whose completion has been stalled due to a lack of funding. We announced the 2012 bursary scheme on CCINFO, the Cochrane Collaboration's bi -weekly e -mail newsletter, on September 27, 2012 and posted the Call for Applications and Application Form on the CAM Field website, with a deadline of 3 December 2012 set for rec eipt of applications. Eric Manheimer and David Moher of the University of Ottawa Evidence -based Practice Centre formally evaluated all applications received and selected the two proposals to each receive the $5,000 USD award. One of the successful proposal s was for a Cochrane review on 'Chinese herbal medicine for allergic rhinitis', and the other was for a Cochrane review of 'Complementary therapies for acne vulgaris'. The awardees were notified on 14 December 2012. Systematic Reviews Training For systema tic reviewers in CAM, specialized training is often required due to the many unique challenges CAM reviewers face. These challenges include appropriately evaluating and addressing the heterogeneity and complexity of both the interventions and controls and incorporating these assessments into the analyses; locating all relevant RCTs, many of which are in difficult to locate sources; and providing a proper assessment of the adequacy of the treatment administered. To assist reviewers in addressing these challe nges, Eric Manheimer and Susan Wieland presented an interactive pre -conference workshop on systematic reviews at the 7th International Congress on Complementary Medicine R esearch in Portland in May 2012 and at the 8th International Congress on Complementar y Medicine Research in London in April 2013. We have further developed and further disseminated our systematic review workshop training material through our linkages with the International Society for Complementary Medicine Research (ISCMR). For example, S usan Wieland and Eric Manheimer collaborated with ISCMR to present a 5 day clinical research methodology training course at the Baltimore -based Institute for Integrative Health in March 2013, which included a 2 day workshop on the methodology of CAM system atic reviews. International Collaboration The CIM/Cochrane CAM program also fosters collaboration among systematic reviewers worldwide. Each year at the Cochrane Colloquia, Field faculty host the international Cochrane CAM Field meeting, which provides a n opportunity for CAM Field contributors from multiple Cochrane Groups around the world to network and collaborate on their CAM -related activities. At the 2013 Cochrane Colloquium in Auckland , New Zealand , Eric Manheimer and Susan Wieland and our internati onal collaborators presented updates to interested Cochrane members on Field activities and plans for the near future. CAM Field faculty also respond on an ad hoc basis to requests for peer -reviewers from coordinators of Cochrane Collaborative Review Grou ps. To identify potential peer -reviewers, faculty members consult our regularly maintained and updated database of details about CAM Field members. Because each member indexed in the database is coded on both CAM area of expertise and on Cochrane role inte rest, the identification of a member with the appropriate expertise and interest is greatly facilitated. During 2012-13 we continued collecting information prospectively from all persons attending CAM Field lectures , workshops or meetings who indicated the y wished to be included in the CAM Field database of members. Methodological Research The CIM/Cochrane CAM program also conducts research to critically examine the methodology of systematic reviews . Review of methodology, already well underway in conven tional medicine, is important to ensure the 41 validity and quality of the research, and should become standard practice in CAM as well. There now exists a substantial research base of randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews evaluating the effecti veness of CAM therapies; only a high quality study can provide a reliable assessment of the effectiveness of a therapy. To address this important issue, researchers have begun devising methods for the optimal conduct of RCTs and systematic reviews in CAM, as well as the optimal methods of evaluating the quality of the research already conducted. In 2012-2013, we continued our collaboration with the University of Ottawa Evidence -based Practice Centre to conduct a methodological review examining the characte ristics of CAM systematic reviews. The conduct and reporting of systematic research on CAM therapies must be of high quality if stakeholders are to interpret research findings with confidence. This study evaluated and compared methodological and reporting characteristics of a sample of CAM -related systematic reviews and a comparison sample of non -CAM systematic reviews. The study concluded that the two types of reviews exhibited different strengths and weaknesses, but that there were some areas, such as rep orting sources of funding, in which both types of reviews require improvement. This study report was published by PLOS One on 14 January 2013. Finally, we published a systematic review of case reports of adverse events of acupuncture, in Evidence Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine , on 20 March 2013 . Incidence rates for major adverse events of acupuncture are often considered to be best estimated from large prospective surveys of practitioners. Four recent surveys of acupuncture safety among regu lated, qualified practitioners, two conducted in Germany and two in the United Kingdom, confirm that serious adverse events after acupuncture are uncommon. These surveys, covering more than 3 million acupuncture treatments all together, found that there we re no deaths or permanent disabilities, and all those with adverse events fully recovered. Thus, it can be concluded that acupuncture has a very low rate of adverse events, when conducted among licensed, qualified practitioners in the West. However, any me dical intervention has the potential to cause harm, particularly when administered by untrained or unqualified practitioners, or in an unhygienic setting. Such potential risks are best estimated from systematic reviews of case reports. Our recent systemati c review of case reports identified isolated case reports of bacterial infections resulting from acupuncture administered in unhygienic settings (skin contact with unsterilized equipment and dirty towels) as well as injuries resulting from the use of 'embe dded' acupuncture needles. While there are several methodological problems with the evaluation of such case reports, a review of case reports can nevertheless identify signals that might suggest the potential for adverse events of acupuncture, when adminis tered in specific settings, or when using specific acupuncture styles. Thus, while acupuncture is a relatively safe intervention when administered by regulated qualified practitioners, it is not risk free if used in an unregulated setting or if administere d by untrained or negligent practitioners. Dissemination The CAM Field has recently begun a collaboration with the Department of Epidemiology of McMaster University to communicate the message of Cochrane Reviews to the general public through the creati on of Summary of Findings tables/Plain Language Summaries (SoF/PLS) of CAM -related Cochrane Reviews. We had previously work ed with the Norwegian branch of the Nordic Cochrane Centre to prepare these SoF/PLS. Each SoF table focuses on the major comparison f rom a review (e.g. acupuncture versus sham acupuncture) and shows in a tabular format the findings for each outcome for this comparison, as well as an evaluation of the overall strength of the evidence for each finding. The PLS are derived from the SoF tab les. After the SoF/PLS have been prepared, they are sent to the Cochrane review authors in order to verify that they accurately reflect the findings of the review. These SoF/PLS, which have been under development by the Cochrane Collaboration since 2000, are based upon the GRADE approach for evaluating the strength and quality of research evidence, and will be required for the next generation of Cochrane reviews. Our goal is to disseminate these SoF/PLS in order to widen access to the work of the Cochrane C ollaboration and to make plain language information from CAM -42 related Cochrane reviews accessible to providers and consumers of CAM. Our previous collaboration with the Nordic Cochrane Centre had resulted in the preparation of SoF/PLS for 28 Cochrane revie ws. Beginning with the July/August 2009 issue of the journal Altern Ther Health Med, the CAM Field launched a column to highlight some of the recent SoF/PLS of CAM -related Cochrane reviews for CAM researchers and clinicians . In 2012, we moved the column fr om Altern Ther Health Med to Global Advances in Health and Medicine , a new journal which has been launched by the former Editors of Altern Ther Health Med . An introduction to and description of Cochrane SoF/PLS was published in this new journal's first iss ue of March 2012 , and two Global Advances in Health and Medicine columns on Cochrane CAM reviews have been published to date . For our recently begun collaboration with McMaster University, a scoping exercise has been completed, which has found that most Cochrane CAM -related reviews still do not have SoF tables, and do not have PLS based on these SoF. Nancy Santesso (of McMaster University) and Eric Manheimer have worked to identify CAM -related Cochrane reviews with a high priority for SoF/PLS, based on se veral considerations, including whether the review had been published in the last year or two; whether it had clinically relevant findings based on a fairly high quality of evidence; and whether it is likely to be of interest to CAM practitioners. Sources consulted to identify such high priority reviews include the Cochrane in the News webpage ( http://www.cochrane.org/in -the- news ); the list of the top 50 most accessed Cochrane reviews ( http://www.cochrane.org/cochrane -reviews/top ); and lists of Cochrane reviews selected for podcasts ( http://www.cochrane.org/podcasts ). Over the coming year Nancy Santesso will be working in consultation with Eric Manheimer in the preparation of 6 SoF/PLS of CAM -related Cochrane reviews. A minimum of 2 of these SoF/PLS will be published in Global Advances in Health and Medicine . The CAM Field faculty also maintai ns a webpage of streamlined and simp lified lay summary overviews of Cochrane CAM reviews. The overviews , which provide short, easy to understand summaries of all Cochrane CAM -related reviews relevant to the treatment of a specific condition , are available on the 'Consumer Summaries' page of the CAM Field website ( http://www.compmed.umm.edu/cochrane_consumer.asp ), organized according to the therapeutic area, healthcare condition, and treatment. It is our hope that these overviews are useful to consumers or p atients who are looking for the bottom -line message about the Cochrane evidence for CAM treatments . Finally, to provide outreach to the broader scientific community on the Cochrane CAM Field resources, Brian Berman and Eric Manheimer gave a joint keynote presentation at the 2013 London International Congress of Complementary Medicine Research, describing the resources developed by the Cochrane CAM Field. This presentation included a discussion of the topics list of CAM -related Cochrane reviews, the databas e of CAM trials, and the CAM Field's development of brief summaries of CAM -related Cochrane reviews. Patient Care 43 The clinical services at the Center for Integ rative Medicine are organized around the C enter's vision of providing comprehensive care that values mind, body, and spirit, and blends conventional medicine with evidence -based complementary therapies. In the past year , the clinical program provided integrative services at the clinic at the Kern an Orthopedics and Rehabilitation Hospital , acupuncture services at the University of Maryland's Depart of Family Medicine c linic, and inpatient integrative medicine at the University of Maryland Medical Center that included the R Adams Crowley Shock Traum a Center and the Greenebaum Cancer Center. Clinical services support the Center's clinical research program and are an integral part of the Center's education program . Practitioners During the past year, a number of key practitioners include have provided medical, acupuncture, and other complementary services . Medical Providers Brian Berman, MD, LAc, Director , is a Professor of Family and Community Medicine and the founder and director of the University of Maryland Center for Integrative Medicine, the first center for research, education and clinical care in complementary and integrative medicine based in a U.S. academic health center. A family physician and pain management specialist, Dr. Berman significa ntly changed his own practice of medicine over twenty years ago to a broader, integrative approach that includes complementary therapies and mind/body approaches, and introduced this approach at the Center's clinic and other clinical practices at the Unive rsity of Maryland. Dr. Berman's desire to see integrative medicine receive wider acceptance has resulted in his becoming one of the most highly funded NIH researchers in this field over the past seventeen years. On the national and international front, Dr. Berman has taken a leadership role in promoting integrative medicine, based on a firm evidence -based approach. With two NIH Center for Excellent in Research on CAM (CERC) and many other research study grants under his belt, he also has more than 250 p eer-reviewed journal articles, many of which are related to those CERC studies. He chaired the ad -hoc advisory committee to the NIH Office of Alternative Medicine when it opened in 1992 and subsequently served on their advisory committee for 6 years , on w hich he is again serving . He was the first chair of the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine, composed of 50 North American universities, and served on the Institute of Medicine panel on complementary medicine, whose report was r eleased in January 2005. Dr. Berman also co-founded and coordinates the complementary medicine field within the Cochrane Collaboration, an international organization dedicated to evaluating all medical practices through systematic reviews of the research literature. At a ceremony in New York City in November of 2005, Dr. Berman was awarded the Bravewell Leadership Award, which \"pays tribute to an outstanding person who is transforming healthcare through integrative medicine. \" Lauren Richter, DO, MAc , Ass istant Medical Director, provides primary care in the clinic by integrating whole person medical evaluations, acupuncture and osteopathic manipulation. Dr. Richter earned a degree in osteopathic medicine from the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medici ne in 1984. She chose to pursue an osteopathic education because it spoke to her belief PATIENT CARE 44 that the art of medicine was about treating individual people, not individual symptoms. As part of her growth towards offering a more holistic approach to medical care , she also completed a master's degree in acupuncture, graduating in 2004 from Tai Sophia Institute in Laurel, Maryland. She is also pursuing certification in Functional Medicine and plans to sit for the new exam in September 2013 . Dr. Richter received advanced training in auricular acupuncture and attended a seminar on new techniques in pain management with the use of acupuncture. Since Dr. Richter has been with the clinic, she has helped develop the care offered to the residents of the local community, as well as to people who seek out the clinic from surrounding states. Her approach is to listen to patients, exploring their backgrounds, past medical treatments and hopes and goals for better health. She then works with them to ev aluate all the available possibilities for treatment - herbs, supplements, medical prescriptions, acupuncture, energy healing and nutrition. Together, with her patients, she develops a plan of action and helps coordinate the treatment circle, helping to m onitor the input of all the allied health professionals who will jointly help care for the client. Her primary goal is to provide a systematic approach to health care that allows a patient to achieve better physical health by understanding the science beh ind their illness, as well as the emotional patterns that affect their ability to be more fully engaged in life. Dr. Richter had attended a number of Institute of Functional Medicine Intensives and has participated in educational updates through the Maryland Association of Osteopathic Physicians . She has lectured to students at Johns Hopkins University at their Empowering Future Physicians Conference , as well as to the Family Medicine residents at University of Maryland . She has also lectured to the medical students as part of the Integrative Medicine elective and presented a lecture on Fatigue and the Adrenals at the first annual Health and Wellness Conference sponsored by CIM. Additionally, s he has spent over 120 hours training pre -med, medical and post -doctoral students in the Clinic . Dr. Richter continues to reach out to the community by offering her support to naturopaths, chiropractors, acupuncturists and mental health providers. She offer s the functional medicine services of our Clinic to their clients and works closely with them to provide integrative medical care to their clients when they are unable to do so because of laws and restrictions in the state of Maryland . Joyce Frye, DO, MB A, MSCE has provided primary care, with an emphasis on women's health, homeopathy and osteopathy. Dr. Frye joined us from the University of Pennsylvania where she completed a post -doctoral fellowship in epidemiology sponsored by the NIH to encourage research in complementary therapies. Prior to that, Dr. Frye had a private practice in OB/GYN for over twenty years, as well as chairing the Dept. of Gynecology at Presbyterian Medical Center in Philadelphia, co -founding the Jefferson Cen ter for Integrative Medicine, and serving on numerous committees. Trained in a variety of complementary modalities, Dr. Frye has been certified by the American Board of Holistic Medicine. She is especially interested in osteopathy and in homeopathy, havin g served as the president of both the National Center for Homeopathy and the American Institute of Homeopathy.

He has extensive experience with program direction and quality measurement and improvement, having services as Vice President of a large group practice, chief medical officer for BlueCross BlueShield of Illinois, and Director of the national Medicare Quality Improvement Organization program at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Dr. Rollow came to integrative medicine as a result of his experience of the importance of approaching patients from the perspective of the whole person. He views health problems as multi -dimensional, and consequently seeks to obtain a broad view of what might be contributing to them. This begins with clarifying what the pat ient wants to accomplish, facilitating the expression of contributing factors and goals, and guiding the patient to diagnostics, prevention, therapeutics, and practices that might be helpful. Dr. Rollow has a particular interest in healing \u2014exploring the r elationship between clinical problems and their meaning, emotional, and spiritual connections, and how this can result in improvement in health and wholeness. Paula Golding - Jn Pierre , MPH earned her BA in psychology and an MPH (with a concentration in healthcare admi nistration) from Hunter College of CUNY in New York City.

The Clinic at Kernan Hospital Our hours are at the clinic at Kernan are : Monday & Wednesday 8:30am -5:00pm Tuesday & Thursday 8:30am -7:00pm Friday 8:30am -12:30pm We provided care through approximately 9,000 patient visits during the year. We provide d a menu of supplements and use specialized diagnostic testing in the provision of integrative care. This, and our arra y of services, set us apart from primary and specialty care practices and are the primary reason that our 48 patients seek us our for consultations and care. We also provide d a range of classes and group sessions to help patients with self -care practices. Services provided included the following: Acupuncture As an integral part of traditional Chinese Medicine, acupuncture is a way of treating disorders and promotes wellness by inserting fine, sterile needles into the skin at very specific points. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends acupuncture as an effective treatment for more than forty medical problems, including allergies, respiratory conditions, gastrointestinal disorders, gynecological problems, headaches, and chronic pain associated w ith problems like back injuries and arthritis. Chinese Herbal Medicine Herbology is traditionally one of the more important modalities utilized in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) besides acupuncture. Each herbal medicine prescription is a cockt ail of many herbs tailored to the individual patient. Chinese herbology often incorporates ingredients from all parts of plants (e.g., the leaf, stem, flower, root), as well as ingredients from animals and minera ls. One batch of herbs is typically decocte d twice over the course of one hour. Nowadays , herbal medicine is made into powder form, tinctures, or pills for easier intake. Physician Consultation Physicians who specialize in integrative medicine combine complementary and alternative therapies wi th standard western treatments in order to create individualized treatment plans that help foster healing of the whole person including body, mind, emotions, and spirit. Initial visits are extensive, information -gathering sessions to discuss personal and m edical history, specific concerns, and treatment needs , while follow -up visits focus on specific recommendations and results. The therapeutic relationship is viewed as a partnership between physician and patient who mutually decide which combination of tre atment options may best address both acute health issues and complex medical conditions in order to achieve optimal health. Homeopathy Homeopathic physicians seek to cure their patients on the physical, mental and emotional levels; and, each treatment is tailored to a patient's individual needs. Remedie s are chosen by the law of simil ars (i.e., let like cure like). Homeopathy is generally a safe treatment, as it uses medicines in extremely diluted quantities. There are usually minimal side effects. Osteopathy Osteopathic physicians understand how all the body's systems are interconnected and how each one affects the others. They focus special attention on the musculoskeletal system \u2014the bones and muscles that make up about two -thirds of the body's mas s\u2014knowing that the body's structure plays a critical role in its ability to function and heal itself. There are numerous styles of Osteopathic Manipulative Therapy (OMT). \"Osteopathy in the Cranial Field\" pays special attention to the pulsations that arise from neural tissue. When practiced by no n-osteopaths it has been named cranio -sacral Therapy. OMT can be helpful in managing pain resulting from structural imbalances and injuries even when remote from the time of their occurrence. 49 Integrative Behavior al Health Consultation In an integrative health consultation, you will work collaboratively with a health psychologist to discover the possible relationships in your life between stress, emotions, thinking patterns, and physical health. You will work together to create an individualized treatment plan for optimal health. Practical strategies will be offered to help you clarify your goals and values and to begin to take steps toward better health and wellbeing. You will also explore potential barriers t o reaching your wellness goals and ways to effectively overcome these obstacles. Integrative Psychotherapy Our health psychologist provides integrative psychotherapy for individuals and couples. Your sessions will focus on understanding and using the conn ection between mind, body, and spirit to improve your emotional wellbeing and quality of life. Psychotherapy can help you to address many of the issues that are keeping you from living a happy and healthy life: depression, anxiety, stress, chronic pain, ch allenging healthy lifestyle behaviors (i.e., exercising, healthy eating, and weight loss), relationship issues, sleeping problems, existential and spiritual issues, and coping with the challenges of illness. A wide range of holistic and psychological servi ces are provided, including cognitive -behavioral therapy, mind -body stress reduction methods (e.g., breath -work, guided imagery, mindfulness, and progressive muscle relaxation), behavioral change for healthy lifestyles, mindful eating, spiritually -integrat ed therapy, and motivational interviewing. Clinical Herbal Medicine Herbal medicine is the art and science of using medicinal plants to support health and healing. Our clinical herbalist recommend s herbs based on their strong historical use as well as current scientific research. Because safety and efficacy are our top priorities, our clinician seeks out high quality products and manufacturers and always considers possible herb -drug interactions. Massage Massage is manipulation of the soft body tissues of the body and is based on anatomical and physiological philosophy. Massage works primarily on the muscles, tendons, ligaments, skins, joints and other connective tissues, as well as the circulator y and lymphatic systems. Nutrition Counseling An approach that examines the relationship between diet and health , patients are counseled according to their individual needs, with an emphasis on healthy, flavorful food options . Reflexology A non-invasive manual modality that involves the use of pressure applied to the reflex areas of the hands, ears, and feet. Reflexology improves circulation and may provide relief from migraines, digestive problems, stress, insomnia, pain (e.g., neck, should ers, back, jaw), as well as many other conditions. Reiki A Japanese treatment that is spiritual in nature and uses the technique of \"laying on of hands\" to balance the life force energy each person has. When the life force energy is out of balance, one i s more likely to suffer illness, pain, or stress. 50 Inpatient Clinical Services within the University of Maryland Medical Center In 200 8, Donna Audia, RN took on a formal role as a full -time an integrative care nurse at the University of Maryland R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center where she provides integrative care treatments to patients, families, and staff throughout the University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC) . The integrative care services were in such high demand that just three years after Don na's appointment, the hospital hired Lolly Forsythe -Chisolm , a Healing Pathways graduate, artist , and Reiki Master, to be an integrative care tech. Since joining the team, Lolly has not only treated patients and brought her artistic gifts to the hospital via her Art for Compassion program, but she has expanded the network of connections between our Healing Pathway program 's graduates and the integrative care team. Even with the additional help that Lolly provide d, calls and requests for services still far outweigh ed their capacity to respond to them all. The Integrative Care Team, which now consists of Donna Audia, RN, Lolly Forsythe Matt Peroutka , provide s Reiki, sound and therapeutic music , acupressure, mindfulness meditation, breathing techniques, Art for Compassion , and therapeutic journaling instruction to the patients in Shock Trauma. This year the team saw approximately 4000 patients \u2014a clear indication that the team is providing much needed services. This past year the inpatient team has provided thousands of treatments for patients, families and staff within the University of Maryland Medical Center and education and support to the various units and departments including R A dams Cowl ey Shock Trauma Center, Anesthesia Department Grand Rounds, University of Maryland Professional Development department education for new hires and graduate nurses, and providing a trauma anesthesiology fellow a six week introduction into Integrative Medici ne. Classes for the public in acupressure and art and movement were taught by team members. The team has developed protocols for the upcoming facial transplant patients and families for their healing processes. Electronic documentation for Integrative Medicine was developed to improve communication for all healthcare providers within the Universi ty of Maryland Medical System. This will assist other hospitals within University of Maryland as new Integrative Medicine programs are developed, such as the rehabilitation hospital. Matthew Peroutka composed music to accompany Coos Hamburger's photographi c journey of Integrative Medicine in Shock Trauma. The music was professionally recorded by Carol Joy Loeb and therapeutic music intern Martha Vance. The team received a University of Maryland Medical Center \"Great Stories \"award for the care to a patient during her hospitalization. Donna Audia and Lolly Forsythe -Chisolm received Shock Trauma Hero awards for their work with the face transplant patient. Alanna Berman, an art student from Rhode Island School of Design, shadowed Lolly and Donna in the winter of 2012/2013. During this time, she interviewed 10 University of Maryland Center staff members and complied their responses into the following article that was published on the Center's blog: 51 Working Artfully within the Forsythe -Chisolm and Alanna Berman \"Creativity is not a talent but a way of operating.\" ~ John Cleese Healthcare acts as a microcosm of our rapidly changing culture. The arts are working their way back into care and wellbeing. To recognize that Art can take many forms, the Integrative Care team assigned our first art intern to interview staff within the hospital that are doing their job in a creative manner. Having an appreciation of the arts can encourage a creative work environment as well as inspire value and meaning within any duty, career or job. The framework and focus of this project was to ask ten University of Maryland Medical Center staff three questions: How did you decide on your profession, what keeps you excited to come to work, and do yo u have a core belief which keeps you anchored in times of challenge or stress. These questions are important to ask ourselves in times of change both in our culture and our workplaces. Acknowledging what is important in our lives is the start of stress man agement and self -care. Each story we heard from our coworkers was interesting and varied. To organize and present a small portion from each staff member, we decided break it down into \"Ten lessons the Arts teach\" from a list created by Elliot Eisner. Good judgments about qualitative relationships . Harold Hardinger has been a nurse for 39 years. Harold came to trauma after time as a Navy Corpsman. Working in the Trauma Resuscitation Unit, he loves that it is different every day. He has to have good judgmen t and bring that to his \"gut feeling\" about how a patient is doing. His positive outlook and job satisfaction comes in part from the \"feeling of saving a life.\" Harold swims and enjoys time on his farm in order to de -stress. Problems can have more than one solution . Dan Eisner is an Occupational Therapist and life coach at the hospital. Dan knew he did not want a desk job. His passion is \"learning about the process of change.\" Knowing that there is creativity in solving a problem or challenge, Dan has fo cused on including patients in their care using principles of emotional management and balance. Dan's core belief is one of evolution, \"we are on this plane to learn and evolve.\" Dan spends time in nature, exercises and enjoys family and pets to reconnect and find balance. Learning in the arts requires the ability and willingness to surrender to the unanticipated possibilities of the work as it unfolds . Brian Nelson is a Nurse Case Worker at the hospital. Brian came to nursing after recognizing the flexibi lity of hours and reliable pay. Brian enjoys that \"no two cases are the same\" as well as the challenge of helping families navigate unanticipated possibilities within discharge details. Brian has a core belief and pride in the teamwork that he feels at Uni versity of Maryland Medical Center. Brian is trained as a Massage Therapist and offers this service to co -52 workers during times of stress. Time with his family is a priority as Brian is a coach for his children's sports teams and enjoys athletics. The arts celebrate multiple perspectives . Brian Burke is a Clinical Education Specialist with experience as a Pediatric nurse at the Medical Center. After volunteering with The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Brian switched to nursing from a career in banking. Brian spoke about being able to see the big picture within the acuity of a situation or challenge. Having the ability to take a step back for multiple perspectives has offered Brian the chance to bring a unique compassion to his nursing and now his work within t he Department of Clinical Practice and Professional Development. Admiring the \"commitment and energy of nursing,\" Brian uses a positive attitude and belief in nursing education to help \"create an environment for the patients to which they do not otherwise have access while hospitalized.\" As a core belief, Brian values relationships, working toward a goal and education. Time with his growing new family is a top self -care priority in Brian's life. The arts make vivid that neither words in their literal form nor number exhaust what we can know. Becky Halagarda is a Child Life Specialist with a Master 's Degree in Social Work; she works in the Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Department at the hospital. Guiding children and families through difficult diagnoses, Bec ky knows that sometimes it is not the words that offer solace but the artistic expression. She often uses art and creativity to make the hospital world/equipment less threatening for children. She finds inspiration in her work when she experiences the \"res ilience in children and families.\" She offered the reminder that the staff can share and tell stories in order to advocate for the creative care that treats the whole patient. Becky uses athletics as her self -care and her faith as a resource for balance in her life. The arts teach that small differences can have large effects . Richie Stever is a Project Manager at the hospital. It is Richie's job to \"keep the hospital building healthy so patients and families can come to get healthy.\" On the roof of the No rth hospital 14 stories high, Ritchie is responsible for the management and construction of a new air ventilation system which will make a difference in the hospital's air quality. \"Changing the building's performance by constructing a new X Ray room in the front of the house and installing new 'green' equipment in the back of the house\" is what keeps Richie excited about his work. Fishing, biking and spending time with his kids is what helps him re - charge. The arts teach us to think through and within a material . Chris Shippen is a nurse lactation consultant for the Division of Women's and Children's Health, working out of the Mother/Baby/Gyn Unit at the Medical Center. Chris has used her 30 -plus years of nursing experience to think through some ways to c reatively \"process events which will affect the life of an Obstetrics (OB) nurse.\" She teaches her OB student nurses to use journaling during their clinical work. Through her work lecturing about bereavement and breastfeeding, Chris finds satisfaction impa cting lives in a positive manner. Her core beliefs in spirituality as well as the fact that there are so many opportunities to learn and grow in nursing keep her coming to work day after day. Chris's self -care involves using 53 Integrative Care modalities for herself as well as finding creative ways to offer relaxation to patients, families, and staff. The arts help us learn to say what cannot be said . Reverend Susan Roy is the head of Pastoral Care Services at UMMC. Susan was planning to spend her career as a Lutheran Pastor in Parish Ministry. She \"allowed faith to lead\" her to serve in specialized ministry at the Medical Center. At the hospital, she has been inspired by the diversity of opportunity, the chance to meet new people, and the \"unexpected\" nature of her days. Susan uses stories from her faith to create poetry which helps her deal with challenges of a busy hospital. For Susan, writing poetry helped to \"capture the rawness and find expression for strong feelings.\" Susan's faith forms her core belief in \"compassion for all\" and her self -care involves spending time with pets, friends, and family. The arts enable us to have experience we can have from no other source. Robert Wright is a Volunteer for the Medical Center as a member of the Trauma Survivo rs Network. Rob's motorcycle accident was seven years ago; he has been coming in as a visitor for patients for four years. Rob decided to become a volunteer when he realized that some patients did not have support and many would benefit from a perspective which differed from the medical focus. Inspiration comes for Rob when he is able to see a patient become motivated to move through great odds after hearing about his journey of daily hard work and triumph to get back to wellbeing. Rob values the chance to tell this story and connect to others through the Trauma Survivors Network Support Group. During times of stress, Rob is reminded and \"humbled\" that he has \"already been to flat line and there is nowhere to go but up from there.\" The arts position within the medical center acts as a symbol for what we believe is important as a culture . Mark Walker is a new nurse on Gudelsky 9 Surgical Intermediate Care Unit. He came to nursing after a career in Finance and Real Estate as a licensed Settlement Agent. Recog nizing that the sales world taught him valuable people skills, Mark wondered if the job in Real Estate was the best place for his talents and time. He realized that nursing offered him the ability to \"make a difference in someone's life in a 12 hour shift. \" With his core belief that \"we are all part of the same stuff,\" Mark has a commitment to teach nurses people skills, compassion and to include mind, body and Spirit to treat the whole person/patient. Each is an important aspect for what we value as a cult ure and a changing healthcare environment. For self -care, Mark spends time with family and makes time for meditation and spiritual inquiry. Each of the staff members spoke of the importance of relationship both within family as well as work. They all also recognized that hospital -wide there is a range of opportunities and encouragement to continue to evolve and learn both from educational opportunities as well as from each challenge. As we spoke to each staff member, it was evident that working artfully involves a willingness to imagine a bigger picture, to experiment, and to be flexible. Staff also all had a thorough recognition of resources available as well as a willingness to use thoughtful self -reflection when facing difficulty. Working artfully incl uded a range of self -care habits which staff used to 54 recharge and reconnect. Each also had a desire to pass on knowledge using communication as well as valuable training, and experience. Within the rapidly changing culture and healthcare environment, self -care must be a priority. As a quick assessment, ask yourself these same three questions: How did I decide on my career? What keeps me excited? And what value system do I turn to when there is challenge? Life stress often takes hold when we say \"Yes\" wi thout first reconnecting to priorities. After taking this inventory, look for creative solutions or different ways to manage or share duties to work artfully within your position. Simply reconnecting to what is important can bring a new clarity and excitem ent to your daily tasks. SOURCE: Eisner, E. (2002).

Dr. Reed is a board -certified family physician, is recognized for his clinical and administrative skills in complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine. He has practiced integrative pain management and chronic disease care over the course of 30 years in Phoenix, AZ, McLean VA, and Arlington, MA. A founding member of the American Holistic Medical Association, and a founder of the American Academy of Medical Acupuncture in 1987, he created the review course curriculum for the Medical Acupuncture Board exam. As Chief Medical Officer of American WholeHealth and Axia Health Management from 1996 to 2008, he oversaw the development of WholeHealth Networ ks health care operations, a national program of over 30,000 CAM practitioner types providing covered and discount access services to health plan and association members in the US. He served in 2008 -2009 as a consulting Medical Director for CAM Services an d Utilization Review for Healthways, a population health management company based in Nashville. In May of 2011, Dr. Reed completed a Master's of Divinity program at Harvard Divinity School, focused on interreligious health care ministry and the role of sp iritual care in the support of both patients and health caregivers. His senior research project was on the spiritual and religious care of veterans with Post - traumatic Stress Disorder. Before joining the faculty at the Center for Integrative Medicine, Dr. Reed was the Integrative Health Program Manager for service members with PTSD and TBI cared for at the National Intrepid Center of Excellence at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. He is Director of Inpatient Services for the Center for Integrati ve Medicine. Currently, Dr. Reed is intimately involved with the planning and creation of an inpatient team -based integrative medicine consult service that involves physician, nursing, and allied health providers and technicians. Among the services that w e plan to offer on a wider basis are acupuncture, acupressure, biofield treatments, relaxation and stress management training, guided imagery, and minimally invasive manual therapies. This program is building on the work of Donna Audia and her team that ha s been supported by the UMMC / STC nursing service for more than 5 years. Donna has been working with CIM 55 staff to explore how to expand these services to meet the ever -increasing demand from hospital staff and patients for access to integrative care. In addition to setting up a more formal system for providing and researching direct patient care modality treatments, the inpatient team intends to work in concert with the UMMC nursing and medical leadership to offer integrative medicine consultations by d epartment or unit to help improve that healing environment through staff support and training in self -care practices. Education 57 The overarching goal of the Center for Integrative Medicine's education program is to help re -focus medical education on humanistic values that recognize the important inter -relationship of mind, body and spirit; the power of self -care and self -healin g; and the importance of the therapeutic relationship. We aim to train healthcare professionals to be able to draw from the best of both conventional and complementary medicine (integrative medicine) in order to treat the whole person. We also aim to prepa re clinical and basic scientists for independent careers in integrative medicine. Medical Students Over the past year, we have continued to offer both core curriculum courses and electives at the medical school including: Second and Third Year Core Cu rriculum The Center provides a number of key lectures as part of the standard curriculum for all second year medical students. These lectures emphasize integrative approaches to the management of pain and stress management. In particular, a lecture is gi ven on the evidence -based use of mind -body therapies in the care of patients with pain and stress -related conditions. CIM faculty members provide individual lectures in other courses in the medical and dental school curriculum as well . During their thi rd year, medical students rotate through various departments within the School of Medicine. As part of the rotation in family medicine, Dr. Lao presents a monthly lecture on acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine. Fourth Year Elective We once aga in offered our popular elective for fourth year students this past academic year. The course was offered twice - in the fall of 2012 and the winter of 2013. Under the leadership of Dr. Chiaramonte, Center faculty and community practitioners provide stude nts with experiential, practical and didactic educational opportunities related to the philosophy, clinical practice and scientific basis of complementary therapies and integrative medicine. The elective has been offered annually since 1995. The populari ty of this class has grown to the point that we have had to add extra seats to accommodate all the interested students. In addition, we have had visiting students from other regional medical schools , as well as international learners from China, attend the course. This course consistently receives highly positive evaluations. Advanced integrative medicine independent study electives and clinical integrative medicine electives are also available. Medical Student CAM Interest Group The University of Mar yland has an active student interest group focused on complementary and integrative approaches to healing. Center faculty collaborate with this group and have provided presentations on integrative medicine in order to reinforce the interest these highly m otivated students have in integrative medicine. The CAM Interest Group president was selected to be the University of Maryland representative EDUCATION 58 for the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine . Dr. Chiaramonte serves as the faculty men tor to the integrative medicine interest group. Residents Family medicine residents have received one hour of lectures from Dr. Lao on acupuncture and pain management as part of their core lecture series. In addition, second year residents shadow pract itioners either in our clinic or downtown in the Family Medicine Clinic for half a day a week for 4 weeks. As part of this rotation they completed selected readings, created patient and provider education material, and were introduced to community CAM pro viders. Drs. Chiaramonte and D'Adamo worked collaboratively with the residency director of the U niversity of Maryland School of Medicine Preventive Medicine R esidency Program to design a competency -based integrative medicine curriculum that could be inco rporated into the preventive medicine residency. Fellowships & Mentoring A competency -based fellowship curriculum has been developed and a full time Integrative Medicine Fellow joined the Center in the Fall of 2012. The Fellow participated in clinical l earning, teaching of medical students and residents and presentation of evidence -based topics to Center faculty during journal club meetings. Additionally, Dr. Chiaramonte teaches a one -hour session on integrative pain management to anesthesia pain manage ment fellows. Over the past year, we have offered numerous health professionals the opportunity to focus their careers on integrative medicine through research and clinical fellowships or through mentorship opportunities with CIM faculty. Clinical fellow ships, such as the Bravewell Fellowships, focus on integrative medicine skills, additional training, and/or shadowing practitioners. Research fellows participate in clinical and pre -clinical research in integrative medicine, including traditional Chinese medicine and mind/body approaches, as well as in CAM systematic reviews (see Informatics section). Center faculty members also provide mentoring for students interested in integrative medicine, serving on dissertation committees, and advising young invest igators who are submitting grants to begin their scientific careers.

The proposed courses ar e novel curriculum for UMB and represent an opportunity to provide an important and relevant interdisciplinary training experience for students. Proper education and guidance is needed to help individuals at all stages of life to make informed and wise d eath-related decisions. It is particularly critical that professionals who work with clients and patients who are dying or who care for the terminally ill or bereaved are adequately trained to deal with these challenging and complex issues. Within this ce rtificate program, students will acquire knowledge, awareness, and sensitivity regarding dying, death, loss, and bereavement. Emphasis will be placed on developing advanced skills in providing specialized care for the dying and the bereaved. Course content will focus on the knowledge, research, theory, and skills that professionals need in understanding and assisting the dying and the bereaved. The influence of history, culture, human development, psychology, religion, law, and ethics on contemporary attitu des and values related to death and dying will be examined. The ways in which students' personal beliefs and experiences with death and dying may influence their professional work will also be addressed. In addition, the program will be designed to meet th e criteria for certification by the Association for Death Education and Counseling. The Certificate Program in Applied Thanatology is intended to meet the needs of individuals who are involved in any and all aspects of the dying, death, and grieving proce ss. Therefore, by its very nature, the Certificate Program will be an interdisciplinary program and will be of interest to a wide range of professionals with baccalaureate or advanced degrees, including healthcare professionals, psychologists, social worke rs, hospice professionals, bereavement counselors, clergy and chaplains, death educators, teachers, police, firefighters, paramedics, funeral directors, and others who provide support and assistance for those affected by death, as well as those who want to expand their own knowledge and skills in dying, death, and grieving. We will target (a) students enrolled in each of the six professional schools at UMB (medical, nursing, pharmacy, social work, law, dental), as well as master's and doctoral students enro lled in the graduate school, (b) healthcare professionals working in the University of Maryland Medical System, and (c) the in -state and out -of-state adult workforce who are involved in the myriad of professions listed above. We also hope to attract intern ational students. The use of distance learning technologies will meet the needs of working, out -of-state, and international students and professionals who have few opportunities to enroll in an on -site program. The inclusion of these targeted audiences wil l ensure an interprofessional, national, and even global experience for all enrolled students. One of our faculty, Delia Chiaramonte, M.D., will teach the section on Palliative Care. Continuing Education Healing Pathways: Integrative Training for Health Care Professionals The Center for Integrative Medicine believes strongly that the combination of advanced technology and ancient wisdom is the greatest path to healing. Drawing from our clinical and research collaborations at R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center at the University of Maryland, we have developed an education program to teach nurses and other health professionals integrative skills such as guided imagery, mind - body techniques, acupressure, Reiki, and sound healing. In addition to didactic an d experiential learning, the course includes several mentored sessions with course faculty at the bedside, so that practitioners can immediately translate what they have learned to their care of patients. 62 In 2008, the Healing Pathways program, design ed and directed by CIM Yoga Program Director Bonnie Tarantino, MFA, received generous start -up funding from the Mittelman Family Foundation. The program was approved b y the American Association of Critical Care Nurses for 31 Continuing Education Units (CEU s), which not only provides validation of the worthwhile nature of the course, but is a major incentive for nurses to participate. During the past year, the Healing Pathways program provided courses that not only trained nurses at the University of Maryla nd, but also nurses from many other hospitals throughout Maryland and across the country. The Healing Pathways course is currently offered twice a year with 15 seats per session and additional advanced trainings are offered throughout the year. This past year, an additional 35 participants completed the Healing Pathways program with most of the participants coming from the VA Medical Center in Baltimore, Washington, Martinsburg, and Perry Point. To -date, more than 135 health care professionals have comple ted the program. The next Healing Pathways class is scheduled to be held in the fall of 201 3. A report was created and sent to the VA administration summarizing feedback from the participants including pre - and post -stress and coping scores. Below is a copy of the document: Department of Veterans Affairs Healing Pathways Program Quality Assurance & Statistical Evaluation Report June 2013 By Bonnie Tarantino, MFA, Director of Yoga Programs Michael D. Earley, MA, Graduate Assistant in Psychology Brian Berman, MD, Director , Center for Integrative Medicine Background In early 2011, Bonnie Tarantino, director of the Healing Pathways program at the University of Maryland Center for Integrative Medicine, began discussions with Dr. Kennita Carter regardin g offering the restorative Healing Pathways program for health care professionals at the Baltimore Veterans Affairs Medical Center. With the assistance of Donna Felling, Mrs. Tarantino and Dr. Carter were able to offer the training in the fall of 2011. T he first cohort of 16 VA employees would ultimately join three additional cohorts, bringing the total number of participants served through the VA Healing Pathways program to 50. All four cohorts completed the program at the Karme Wellness Center in Winds or Mill, MD. As the initial funding period for this project has been completed, we at the Center for Integrative Medicine would like to take this opportunity to provide the VA with course feedback that we believe demonstrates the value of the program fo r participating staff members. We hope that such efforts lay the groundwork for further opportunities to reach additional VA staff via this unique and effective integrative training. We also wish to foster the possibility of future clinical and research collaborations between the Center for Integrative Medicine and the Baltimore Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Our long -term research agenda is to build on the previously published paper on the Healing Pathways Program (Tarantino, et al. 2012) which report ed on the success of our pilot program with a sample of nurses and other clinicians at the University of Maryland Medical Center. We hope to design and implement a more rigorous protocol, including a larger sample of health care employees, that utilizes a waitlist control, investigates mechanisms of action, and includes more comprehensive outcome measures. 63 Scope of Report The following report contains three sources of quality assurance data. First is a statistical analysis testing for significant change s in participant perceived stress and coping ability. Second, a summary of completed participant evaluation forms is provided. Finally, we have included qualitative reflections by program participants that provide a more personal and anecdotal sense of t he programmatic experience. Quantitative Analysis All Healing Pathways participants were asked to complete two self -report questionnaires on two occasions. The Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen, 1983), and the Coping Self -Efficacy Questionnaire (Chesney et al., 2006) were administered at the Baseline and Week -8 visits. Using SPSS version 21, analyses were conducted to determine whether observed changes in participant mean scores were significantly different. Both Perceived Stress and Coping Self - Efficac y were significantly changed at 8 -weeks, with levels of perceived stress decreasing while confidence i n one's ability to cope increased ( p < .001). Figures 1 and 2 below illustrate the observed change. Figure 1 : Change in Mean Coping Self -Efficacy Figure 2: Change in Mean Perceived Stress 64 Qualitative Feedback via Participant Satisfaction Evaluation After completing the eight -week training program, participants in the Healing Pathways program were asked to complete an evaluation form that assessed the following domains via a five point Likert format. 1. Course Content 2. Effectiveness of Presentation 3. Organization of Presentation 4. How Well Did We Meet Your Objectives 5. Usefulness of AV Materials / Handouts Ratings were made for each week of the course and were designed to assist staff in recognizing any particular aspects of the class that were deemed less effective. Rating choices were as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 Very Poor Poor Fair Good Excellent The total average score for all five domains, across all participants and time points was 4.77. The lowest score, which corresponded to week 6 course materials , was 4.59, with the highest rating of 5.0 being given to a number of categories. Among the most common suggestions for program improvement were: Lengthe n class time or duration of program to allow for more practice Create more post -course structure to facilitate following up with other attendees to discuss how to integrate learning into the workplace Train VA staff to be teachers of healing pathways so th at more staff can have exposure to these tools. Qualitative Feedback The following quotes are taken from writing completed by Healing Pathways participants when asked to reflect on their experience of the program. \"I was given the gift of true forgiven ess both for myself and others. I am also now much more secure in trusting my intuition. This by the way, is huge for me. With Bonnie's gentle guidance and support I have grown personally, professional and spiritually. As a nurse I would highly recommend t his class for all health care professionals it truly bring the element of genuine human caring back into healthcare.\" \"My experience has taught me the tremendous importance of self -care for Healthcare workers. Only with self-care can healthcare workers continue to serve our patients on all levels - emotional, physical, spiritual -that is vital for the whole person to heal. The curriculum presented in Healing Pathways addresses many levels of self -care and personal enrichment necessary for the healthcare prov ider. My personal experience as a participant in Healing Pathways has been phenomenal. The tools being presented are easy to use and sustainable. I have only attended a few sessions and already feel more empowered to deal with the challenges faced in work. \" 65 \"I feel as if I have come home, full circle. I know I am exactly where I belong on my journey. I feel as if I am part of a Healing community where we all speak the same language, share common goals. It is as if I've been thirsty & hungry, dehydrated & undernourished, but didn't \"know\". Now that I do, I'm quenching my thirst & hunger with all the education, energy, & supportive relationships I am privileged to be experiencing along these Healing Pathways. My Life is full of Abundance, & I am full of Grat itude.\" \"The 8 weeks of classes opened my mind up to things I didn't know or understand and motivated me to learn more and practice and share what I know. I believe this is a great program that will benefit all who are able to attend. Whether it is to heal the sick or inspire the unbeliever to think positive thoughts, the techniques taught will offer options that can improve the health and well - being of those who attend and who participate with an open mind to learn. I am grateful I was allowed to att end.\" \"I didn't realize that I would have such a large take away from this class. This class has helped me to bring balance and focus back into my life and allowed me to have tools to help me put myself first. Also it has allowed me to look at my role a s a nurse differently and better handle all the sickness and death I see on a daily basis. My unit is very stressful with a lot of negative energy. I would like to use my training to create safe and healing environments for all those who enter my unit.\" Summary The collaboration between The Center for Integrative Medicine 's Healing Pathways Program and the Baltimore Veterans' Affairs Medical Center has successfully capitalized on a unique opportunity within the VA. As the Center's research team has wo rked to publish our preliminary data on the program's efficacy and looks to further our academic inquiry into the efficacy of Healing Pathways, the VA has been simultaneously fostering opportunities for its staff to embrace wellness and mindfulness. As a clinical and research team, the Center has been delighted to assist the VA in helping to foster and implement Planetree health initiatives. Should future opportunities for collaboration be identified, the Healing Pathways staff is eager to bring this gent le and effective program to additional VA employees and health care professionals. We hope that this report reflects the observed statistical, as well as subjective value, that participants found in using integrative tools in their lives and work. Finall y, we wish to heartily thank the Veterans Affairs Administration for this opportunity and look forward to creative ways by which our staff can assist the VA in meeting future wellness goals for its employees.

Ayurvedic Medicine for Health Professionals The Ayurvedic Medicine for Health Professionals Training course is a 56 -hour training program co - sponsored by the University of Maryl and Center for Integrative Medicine and Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine, in association with Maharishi Ayurveda Association of America. This Level 1 course is taught in four modules. All 4 Modules may be taken online in a distance learning format. In addition, Modules 1 and 4 are offered live onsite , including the University of Maryland in Baltimore . In this training, health professionals are taught practical skills for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease to increase the effectiven ess of his/her healthcare practice. The course includes training in Ayurvedic pulse diagnosis, and other modalities that can be immediately applied in the clinical practice, as well as in one's own life. It is taught by medical doctors with over 25 years of experience in integrating Maharishi Ayurveda into modern medical practice. One participant said this about the training: \"This program has inspired me to adopt Ayurvedic lifestyle changes for myself, and to recommend them to my patients. It has enric hed my clinical practice with an approach to chronic medical conditions that is simple, yet profoundly effective.\" -Jannet Huang, MD, FRCP, FACE, ABIHM; Endocrinologist, Irvine, CA More information about this program can be found at: www.clinical -ayurveda.org . Yoga Teacher Certification with Reiki Master Training Course The University of Maryland Center for Integrative Medicine's Healing Pathways Yoga Teacher Training is designed to prepare health care p rofessionals to use yoga as an integrative tool in the health care profession. Organized and led by our Healing Pathways Director, Bonnie Tarantino, MFA, and co -led by Nancy McPartland, LCSW -C, this unique training gives special attention to the health be nefits of yoga while providing a thorough explanation of postures, yoga philosophy, meditation, toning and chanting. In addition, current research in the medical field is included in the course material, showing the current trends in the field of healing yoga. All participants will graduate, not only yoga teachers, but also as Reiki Masters. Classes began on September 20, 2012 and conclude d with an intensive retreat on May 18, 2013. Eighteen students completed the training, becoming 200 -hour Yoga Allian ce certified yoga teachers. Additionally, all 67 18 students completed their Reiki master training. In total, the training course was over 260 hours during a 9 month time period. Students also completed a special project on a specific healing aspect of yog a. Five of the students chose to accompany Ms. Tarantino on a special 14 -day trip to India to study yoga for healing. During the trip, the students studied advanced meditation practices at Somayag 2013 in Meheshwar and moved through advanced Karuna mater training. While there, they also visited and studied at the Paramanand Institute of Yoga Science & Research in Indoor and the Yoga Institute, Shri Yogendra Marg, Prabhat Colony, Santa Cruz East, and Mumbai. A video with testimonials from the graduated stu dents has been produced and will be posted on the Center's website. It can currently be viewed at www.bonnietarantino.com . Health and Wellness Workshops Due to high -demand, we established a Health and Wel lness Workshop series that began in June 2012. In collaboration with the UMB Wellness Hub, Dr. Michelle Pearce coordinated and led 10 workshops, including \"Managing Stress and Anxiety,\" \"The Art of Assertiveness,\" \"Setting and Achieving Health Lifestyle G oals,\" \"Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Life,\" \"Mindful Eating and Healthy Nutrition,\" \"Relaxation Techniques: Instant Calm,\" and four sessions of a four -week workshop series called \"Writing for Wellness.\" Visiting Professor Claudia Witt, MD, MBA is Vice Director at the Institute of Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics, Professor of Medicine, and Head of the Division for Complementary Medicine at Charit\u00e9 University in Berlin, Germany. She specializes in clinical and epidemiological stud ies in Complementary and Integrative Medicine, as well as economics and safety evaluations. Dr. Witt is collaborating with the Center's current research team on current projects and developing new projects, primarily focusing on methodological aspects of clinical studies and comparative effectiveness research, including health economic analyses. She will also be teaching and lecturing on the UMB campus. Future Directions Interprofessional Integrative Health Education Track Initiated by our Director of Education, Dr. Delia Chiaramonte, we have developed a proposal for a unique and transformative educational program that will allow students to actively pursue their own health and wellness as they learn skills to maximize the health of their patients/clie nts. As they train to be excellent physicians, nurses, dentists, pharmacists, social workers and lawyers, they will also learn to be effective health and wellness mentors. They will learn evidence -based approaches to integrating complementary treatment m odalities with conventional medical diagnoses and treatment. In addition they will gain important collaboration skills by learning alongside students in disciplines other than their own. The goals of the Interprofessional Integrative Health Education Trac k are to create and implement a unique integrative medicine educational curriculum designed to provide an in -depth integrative health educational experience for graduate students at the University of Maryland's Baltimore campus. Students accepted into the program will begin upon matriculation to their graduate program and continue until graduation. The 68 Integrative Medicine track will be available to students in the Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Dentistry, Social Work, Pharmacy and Law and will be designed to accompany each School's standard graduate curriculum. Students will be expected to dedicate hours during their vacations to the program. Drs. Berman and Chiaramonte have had preliminary meeting with the University of Maryland President, Jay Perman, M D, and the Interpersonal Integrative Medicine Track proposal has been met with great interest and support. \"Food as Medicine\" Course Dr. Chris D'Adamo has been developing the curriculum for a \"Food as Medicine\" course for medical students. Recent resea rch has revealed a strikingly poor state of nutrition education in United States medical schools. Perhaps most notably, n early 90% of graduating medical students believe that more time should be dedicated to nutritional education in medical school. The con tent for this course will focus upon practical nutritional topics aimed at both the prevention and treatment of chronic disease and will include: evidence -based assessment of popular diets, scientific rational e and evidence supporting and refuting dietary supplements, organic foods, assessment of genetically modified foods, benefits of eating locally, healthy cooking demonstrations, psychology of eating, food policy, etc. A variety of highly qualified nutritional scientists, physicians, practicing nutrition al professionals, chefs, and other experts will be invited as guest speakers. The ultimate goals of the course are to expose future medical professionals to the nutritional issues that they will face in medical practice and to arm them with the tools to pr ovide effective dietary solutions. International East/West Center Building on the success of the past 20 years, the Center for Integrative Medicine is developing a plan to establish an East/West Center that expands on our existing productive work in trad itional Chinese medicine and our strong collaborations with Asia. Marrying the strengths of two distinct medical practices and philosophies, the East/West Center will serve as an international conduit for new integrated approaches to health promotion and disease management. To this end, the East/West Center will be a partnership between the Center for Integrative Medicine and leading experts from institutions in Hong Kong, mainland China, Singapore, South Korea, and other nations, including universities i n Africa and Europe, with the purpose of fostering research, education, and interdisciplinary models of clinical care, as well as developing initiatives to disseminate this information. Our faculty is actively strengthening relationships and collaborations in Asia, including working with numerous visiting scholars from abroad. Community Outreach 69 In FY2013, the Center for Integrative Medicine increased their Community Outreach efforts. We joined forces with Maryland Hospitals for a Healthy Environment (MD H2E), held our second annual Health & Wellness Conference, participated in an international scientific think tank about inflammation, attended several community health fairs, increased our social media arm, as well as our general media presence. Maryl and Hospitals for a Healthy Environment (MD H2E) This year, Maryland Hospitals for a Healthy Environment (MD H2E) became part of the Center for Integrative Medicine team. They are currently housed in a nearby location on Redwood Street and the team cons ists of Gina Navarro, Molly Englund, Joan Plisko, and Lousie Mitchell . This section is a brief overview of what they do. Since 2005, Maryland Hospitals for a Healthy Environment (MD H2E ) has catalyzed the development and implementation of environmental health and sustainability programs in Maryland's hospitals. Through networking, education, technical assistance, and recognition, MD H2E engages hospitals and other health care facilities in programmatic areas such as waste and toxics prevention, resource conservation, healthy sustainable food procurement, and population health and wellness. MD H2E is the trusted \"go -to\" organization for environmental health and sustainability in health care in Maryland and the Mid -Atlantic region and has achieved many accomplishments over the past seven years. MD H2E serves as a catalyst for change by continuing to \"push the envelope\" in environmental health and sustainability in the health care sector. I n this role, there continue to be many opportunities for reducing health care's ecological footprint. VISION : To advance a culture of environmental health and sustainability in Maryland's health care community. MISSION : Through networking, education, technical assistance, and recognition, MD H2E engages Maryland hospitals and health care providers in becoming leaders in environmental health and sustainability. VALUES : Health ~ Stewardship ~ Lead ership ~ Integrity ~ Prevention ~ Community ~ Collaboration ~ Innovation History of Accomplishments - 2005 to Present MD H2E's Organizational Achievements Created the Maryland Health Care Sustainability Leadership Council and the Chesapeake Food Leadership Council Organized a nd hosted fifth annual Environmental Excellence in Health Care conference, which is financially self -supporting Recognized as a local, state, and national leader through awards, requests for information and speaking engagements, and participation in nation al and regional sustainability working groups A growing listserv and newsletter distribution to close to 2,000 individuals Successfully raising grant funding to support MD H2E 's personnel and initiatives COMMUNITY OUTREACH 70 Successes at Maryland's Hospitals Successful development and implementation of environmental health and sustainability programs at Maryland hospitals including, but not limited to: on -site farmers markets, LEED certified buildings, resource conservation, integrated pest management, environmentally pr eferable purchasing, waste reduction and recycling, local sustainable food purchasing, employee engagement programs, and more Closure of all on -site hospital incinerators in Maryland Development of green teams at eighty percent of the hospitals and health systems in Maryland Designation and hiring of hospital sustainability managers in several Maryland hospitals, including the University of Maryland Medical Center, Anne Arundel Medical Center, and The Johns Hopkins Hospital Recognition of Maryland hospitals as local, state, and national leaders and award winners MD H2E 's activities over the past year can be broken into eight categories, as described below. Developing Leaders in Health Care Sustainability MD H2E continues to support and facilitate the ongoing activities of the Maryland Health Care Sustainability Leadership Council (HCSLC) , which was launched in 2011 and is the first of its kind in the nation. This includes participation in monthly meetings for the leadership and for the four workin g groups , as well as coordination of the quarterly educational meetings and the annual electoral process for the positions of Chair, Vice Chair and Secretary. MD H2E also facilitates the Chesapeake Food Leadership Council , launched in 2009, and its activities including quarterly meetings, core leadership team calls, educational presentations, food purchasing initiatives throughout the supply chain ( i.e. through distributors, group purchasing organizations and direct purchases from local sust ainable farmers), and support of policies that promote a healthier, local sustainable food system at the regional and national level. Th e council originally consisted of food service professionals from hospitals and other institutions (universities, hotel s, sports and entertainment venues, schools). It has recently expanded to include other key stakeholders including local farmers, distributors, agricultural and other non -profit organizations, academic programs and government agencies. MD H2E recognizes health care sustainability leaders through an awards program for providers that have implemented exemplary practices in the area of environmental sustainability. To accomplish this, MD H2E develops awards criteria, puts out a call for applicants, receives and ranks applications, and awards the Trailblazer Awards and the Environmental Health Nursing Aw ard annually. Maryland hospitals and health care professionals also receive other regional and national awards for their accomplishments and leadership in he alth care environmental sustainability including the System for Change, Partner for Change with Distinction, Partner for Change, Partner Recognition, and Making Medicine Mercury -Free Awards by Practice Greenhealth, and the Exemp lary Food Service Profession al Award by the Healthy Food in Health Care Prog ram of Health Care Without Harm. Providing Education and Technical Assistance One of the most successful of MD H2E's educational events is the Environmental Excellence in Health Care Conference, which was held in November, 2012 at the University of Maryland School of Nursing. This nationally recognized \"green\" conference brought to gether over 200 health care leaders from hospitals, academia, as well as the public and private sectors. MD H2E secured sponsors for the event, sent out a call for abstracts to attract top rate speakers, provided an exhibit hall with a local sustainable b reakfast and lunch , convened an invitation -only 71 executive breakfast to discuss the overlap of environmental sustainability and community benefit, and hosted several panels including one on the health impacts of climate change, which featured a leading expe rt from the National Resources Defense Council. MD H2E worked with the six 2012 MD H2E Trailblazer A ward -winning hospitals to document their successful program s in case study format. After the case studies were finalized, MD H2E facilitated an educationa l event at the Greater Baltimore Medical Center as an opportunity for trailblazing hospitals to present their work. Over 100 health care providers attended this event. The topics include d: o Bike-Friendly Hospital o Bulk Waste Reduction Program o Employee Plot -Based Garden o Energy Management Program o Healthier Beverages and Food Waste Reduction o Newborn Pesticide Reduction Pilot MD H2E frequently provides one -on-one technical assistance via phone and email to hospital employees and to the private sector wanting to gain information and insight on the nature of envir onmental sustainability in Maryland's health care community. MD H2E supports hospitals in implementing the national Healthy Food in Health Care initiatives in Maryland including local sustainable food purchasing , the \"Less Meat, Better Meat\" Balanced Menus I nitiative , and the Healthy Beverage s Program . MD H2E also host ed the annual Buy Local Challenge engaging 53 Mid-Atlantic health care facilities in serving over $61,200 of locally produced foods during Buy Local Week , the last full week in July , 2012 . Farmers markets, gardens, and Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) programs for SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) recipients launched at hospitals and nursing homes , providing community benefits by increasing access to healthy foods in low income \"food desert\" communities. Nutrition standards, menu labeling, and elimination of fryers also promoted prevention of obesity and chronic disease. MD H2E developed the resource entitled \" Cost-Saving Strategies for Local Sustainable Meat and Poultry Purchasing by Hospitals and Other Institutions\" and contributed to Health Care Without Harm's national 2013 \"Menu of Change\" report and the case studies reported in \"Health Care's Commitment to Sustainable Meat Procurement.\" Participating in Work Groups MD H2E regularly p articipate s in government, health care , and industry work groups and councils, providing perspective from experience and learning from others. Some of the groups include: Anne Arundel Medical Center Greening the Surgical Services Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) Sustainability Ad Hoc Committee Baltimore City Disaster Preparedness and Planning Project (DP3) Public Health Committee Baltimore Food Policy Advisory Council Baltimore Non Profit L eadership Circle Chesapeake Foodshed Initiative 72 Healthy Food in Health Care Program , including the Supply Chain Transformation, Balanced Menus, and Metrics and Awards Program Work Groups, Health Care Without Harm Institute for a Healthiest Maryland , Academic Partners Johns Hopkins Health System Sustainability Leadership Council MedStar Environmental Leadership Council Special Medical Waste Working Group, Maryland Health Care and Quality Cost Council Delivering Presentations MD H2E gi ves professional presentations at hospitals and other health care facilities, at trade association meetings, and at the request of government agencies , universities and organizations .

To understand the nature and extent of hospital environmental sustainability activities, in conjunction with the Maryland Health Care Sustainability Leadership Council and in cooperation with the Maryland Hospital Association , MD H2E develop ed, disseminate d, and gathered data from a survey of hospital environmental best practices . MD H2E will be writing a report to present the findings of this survey. MD H2E p articipated in d evelop ing and disseminat ing four food related s urveys : two with Health Care Without Harm including t he national 2013 Healthy Food in Health Care survey and awards application and the national Balanced Menus Survey; and two regional surveys including the s upplemental Mid -Atlantic Food Survey , the Mid-Atlantic Balanced Menus survey in conjunction with Masters in Public Health capstone program of the University of Maryland School of Medicine. 73 Communicating to Stakeholders MD H2E provides several avenues for its community to connect and stay ab reast of current local and national environmental sustainability events. For over six years, MD H2E has been developing and distributing a monthly newsletter and posting regular updates to the MD H2E listserv, which currently has approximately 2,000 subscribers. MD H2E m aintain s and post updates to the blog -style web site : mdh2e.org and i ssue s press releases on appropriate activity. Enriching Our Collaborative Network The success of MD H2E's operation and the hospitals that participate in MD H2E's programming hinges on the vast collaborative network with vendors, government agencies, and not -for-profit organizations . MD H2E regularly communicates with, seeks advice from, makes presentations to, and shares information with government agencies, not for profit organizations and associations, as well as for -profit companies. MD H2E does not reinvent the wheel; it seeks to leverage the overlap of organizational strategies and priorities to develop synergistic relationships that will further the vision o f a culture of environmental health and sustainability in Maryland's health care community. Some of the organizations include: Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments At-Site Baltimore Food Policy Council Baltimore Office of Sustainability Chesapeake Foodshed Initiative Eastman Corporation Future Harvest - Chesapeake Alliance for Sustainable Agriculture Health Care Without Harm Health ier Hospital s Initiative Healthiest Maryland Businesses Hilltop Institute Institute for a Heal thiest Maryland Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future Key Green Solutions Maryland Department of Agriculture Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Maryland Department of Natural Resources Maryland Department of the Environment Maryland Envir onmental Health Network Maryland Farm to School Maryland Hospital Association Maryland Patient Safety Center Maryland Pesticide Network Practice Green Health Real Food Challenge Southern Maryland Agricultural Development Commission U.S. Green Building Council Participating in Professional Development MD H2E staff members attend professional webinars and national conferences to stay current on issues and topics in environmental health and sustainability , and to build national networking and collaborative relationships .

Experience. Engage. The University of Maryland Center for Integrative Medicine's second annual Health & Wellness Conference was held on Saturday, May 4, 2013 at the Hilton Baltimore. More than 350 health care profe ssionals and lay people gathered to hear Mark Hyman, MD, doctor, author, and advisor to the Dr. Oz Show, speak about how society can influence health and how we can be a part of the wellness movement. More than 20 leading experts in Integrative Medicine l ed workshop sessions throughout the day, and the lunchtime panel and plenary sessions rounded out the day, giving the audience the opportunity to interact with speakers. \"It was a wonderfully executed conference ,\" said one attendee. \"Each session was better than the previous. I look forward to attending next year and spreading the word about it to others.\" 75 Kevin Chen, PhD led a morning QiGong Workshop From nurses, social workers and yoga practitioners, to physicians, pharmacists and therapists, to the ge neral public, the Conference catered to the interests of health and wellness enthusiasts of all kinds. This year, in addition to Continuing Education credits for many health care professions, the Conference offered a Pain Management track that was approve d for Continuing Medical Education credits, drawing two -thirds more physicians than at the first conference. Overall, 97% of attendees who responded to the post -conference survey reported that the Conference met or exceeded their expectations, and 56 % said their main goal for attending the conference was to gain knowledge to share with others. \" I will share what I learned at the Conference with my patients when they press me for pain meds,\" said one participant who asked to remain anonymous. In a survey comment, another attendee wrote, \" I felt uplifted at the Conference . It was inspiring to see speakers and presenters who strongly projected their desire to help others.\" More than 20 experts in health care and integrative medicine led workshops throughout the day on topics such as nutrition, meditation, yoga, spirituality, environmental health, Ayurveda, manual medicine, acupuncture, and more. Participants were able to select one of three to fiv e workshops from each of the four sessions and were united in one room for Dr. Hyman's keynote lecture, the lunch panel on \"Changing the Paradigm of Health Care,\" and the plenary session addressing \"Pain Management in the 21st Century\" led by the Center's Associate Director Dr. Delia Chiaramonte. \"Are the social threads that connect us as important as the genetic threads?\" asked Mark Hyman, MD, doctor, author, Functional Medicine expert, and advisor to the Dr. Oz Show (pictured left) , in his keynote addres s \"Social Ecosystems and Chronic Disease.\" Through his work, he has discovered that our social environment and connections can be a major influencer over our health. In an inspiring presentation, Dr. Hyman explored how the community can be part of the me dicine and part of the cure. Mark Hyman, MD 76 Delia Chiaramonte, MD \"All of us in healthcare need to embrace our partners across the professions if we are going to serve patients and serve the needs of the public properly,\" said University of Maryland's President Dr. Jay Perman (pictured left) in his remarks that introduce d the lunchtime panel. Moderated by the Center's Director Dr. Brian Berman (pictured center below ),a panel of health care visionaries came together to give the audience an intimate look at how they have seen and helped \"Change the Paradigm of Health Care. \" Dr. Thomas Scalea, physician -in-chief of the University of Maryland R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center, stated, \"It's not so much about what it is we do - it's about the total care package that we provide the people ... we will continu e to push the envelope that is about the total care of the patient and measuring the effect of what it is that we do.\" Lunchtime Panel: Changing the Paradigm of Healthcare (L to R: Diane Hoffmann, Thomas Scalea, MD, Brian Berman, MD, Lori Knutson, RN) Lori Knutson, RN, a nurse who helped make dramatic changes in the healthcare system in the Midwest, shared her story, and Diane Hoffmann, director of the health care law program at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law, addressed how political and legal changes affect health care, such as licensing practices. Half an hour of questions from the audience gave participants a chance to interact with the panel. In a post -lunch plenary lecture, D elia Chiaramonte, MD (pictured right) , Associate Director and Director of Education at the Center for Integrative Medicine, tackled the topic of \"Pain Management in the 21st Century,\" analyzing what we do and what we can do differently, such as looking at the whole person. \"We can't really talk about pain, particularly chronic pain, without thinking about all kinds of things...like people's emotions, their genetics, their social situations, like how happy they are in their life, the context of the pain...\" sai d Dr. Chiaramonte. A running theme throughout the day, Integrative Medicine takes a team approach and looks at the whole person - for better health and wellness.

The meeting was initiated by Biologische Heilmittel Heel GmbH, Baden -Baden, Germany and hosted by the Institute for Integrative Health. In attendance were numerous experts in their field such as: Dr. Brian Berman (Director of the Center for Integrative Me dicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and President of the Institute for Integrative Health); Dr. Andrew Ahn (Harvard Medical School & Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Radiology); Dr. Delia Chiaramonte (University of Maryland Center for Integrative Medicine); Dr. Chris D'Adamo (University of Maryland Center for Integrative Medicine); Dr. Susan Dorsey (University of Maryland School of Nursing; Center for Pain Studies); Dr. Alan Faden (University of Maryland School of Medicine & Research Center for Shock, Trauma and Anesthesiology Research); Dr. Alessio Fasano (Center for Celiac Research & Treatment; Massachusetts General Hospital for Children); Dr. Bert Hannosset (independent practitioner of Bioregulatory Medicine in Leuven, Belg ium), Dr. Martha Herbert (Harvard Medical School & Massachusetts General Hospital, TRANSCEND Research Program); Dr. Arturo O'Byrne (independent practitioner of Bioregulatory Medicine in Cali, Colombia); and Dr. William Rollow (University of Maryland Center for Integrative Medicine). The representative members from Heel were Dr. Alta Smit (Director of Global Medical Affairs & Research), Dr. Bernd Seilheimer (Head of Global Research), Dr. Myron Schultz (Head of Global Medical Affairs ), Dr. Yvonne Burmeister, Dr. Konstantin Cesnulevicius, Dr. David W. Lescheid, and Bruno Van Brandt. Two consultants with Concept Systems Incorporated, Mary Kane and Alyssa Goldman, were also present to help facilitate and focus discussion as well as formally document the meeting in preparation for further concept development and promotion of resultant publications such as a proceedings paper. The think tank began with three thought -provoking lectures from Heel scientists, providing summaries of the latest scientific evidence on: 1) the inflammatory response including active resolution of inflammation, the remarkable plasticity of the immune cells involved, and novel proposed physiological roles for inflammation such as adaptation to various environmental stressors and restoration of a homeostatic state or tolerance; 2) the dynamic and reversible nature of the inflammatory response in fibrosis of the lung and liver and skeletal muscle injuries, the role of an acute inflammatory response in healing of bone fractures, striated muscle injuries, and remyelination of neurons as well as potential control points for resolution of inflammation in tissues such as macrophages, fibroblasts, and extracellular matrix; and 3) the hypothetical links between the inflammatory response and autoregulat ory networks including a tissue danger response, an inflammatory twitch, and an active, adaptive process of information flow with various checkpoint gates. Current advances in technology such as deep sequencing and high throughput genomic screening as well as molecular imaging were also presented as novel methods of comprehensively examining details of the inflammatory response for potential diagnostic and prognostic purposes. 78 The following day included several rounds of focused discussion from the audienc e regarding the scientific material previously presented with specific focus on the role of inflammation in disease progression as well as the beneficial role of acute inflammation with resolution. In addition, an interview was held between three integrati ve medical doctors with extensive clinical experience with the intention of providing more practical information on how medications with bioregulatory properties could be used successfully in clinical practice to treat chronic inflammatory diseases. This v enue and meeting structure provided an excellent opportunity for world leaders in various scientific disciplines to meet in a relatively informal and intimate setting and share their knowledge and ideas on a particular topic. Overall, the meeting was a res ounding success with much food for thought, numerous interesting answers as well as questions raised, and additional insights for future research projects and directives for clinical implementation of these novel scientific concepts. Further steps include additional refinement and development of the introduced ideas through an online forum as well as publication of a summary paper and proceedings. _____________________________________________________________________________ Leadership/Stewardship Dr. Brian Berman is a member of the executive committee of the University of Maryland School of Medicine; serves on the American Pain Society Task Force; is a NIH/NCCAM Advisory Council member; serves on the boards of the McCormick Science Institute and the Ta i Sophia Institute; is one of the founding members of the American Board of Physician Specialties' new American Board of Integrative Medicine Dr. Delia Chiaramonte serves as the University of Maryland Steering Committee Member to CAHCIM and is a member of the CAHCIM Education Working Group Dr. Chris D'Adamo served as a peer -reviewer for the following scholarly journals during FY2011: Nutrition Research , Journals of Gerontology: Biological and Medical Sciences , Evidence Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine , and Journal of Aging and Physical Activity .

The aims of our meta-analysis were to quantify the overall pooled effects of adjuvant acupuncture on IVF clinical pregnancy success rates, and evaluate whether study design-, treatment- and population-related factors influence effect estimates. &The Author 2013.

Our primary outcome was clinical pregnancy rates. We obtained from all investigators additional methodological details and outcome data not included in their original publications. We analysed sham-controlled and no adjuvant treatment- controlled trials separately, but since there were no large or signicant differences between these two subsets, we pooled all trials for subgroupanalyses. We prespecied 11 subgroup variables (5 clinical and 6 methodological) to investigate sources of heterogeneity, using single covariate meta-regressions. results: Sixteen trials (4021 participants) were included in the meta-analyses. There was no statistically signicant difference between acupuncture and controls when combining all trials [risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% condence interval (CI), 0.96-1.31; I2\u00bc68%; trials; 4021 (RR 1.02, 0.83-1.26; I2\u00bc66%; 7 trials; 2044 participants) or adjuvant treatment-controlled trials (RR 1.22, 0.97-1.52; I2\u00bc67%; 9 trials; 1977 participants). The type of control used did not signicantly explain the statistical heterogeneity (interaction P\u00bc0.27). Baseline pregnancy rate, measured as the observed rate of clinical pregnancy in the control group of each trial, was a statistically signicant effect modier (interaction P,0.001), and this covariate explained most of the heterogeneity of the effects of adjuvant acupuncture across all trials (adjusted R2\u00bc93%; I2residual \u00bc9%). Trials with lower control group rates of clinical pregnancy showed larger effects of adjuvant acupuncture (RR 1.53, 1.28-1.84; 7 trials; 1732 participants) than trials with higher control group rates of clinical pregnancy(RR 0.90, 0.80-1.01; 9 trials; 2289 participants). The asymmetric funnel plot showed a tendency for the intervention effects to be more benecial in smaller trials. conclusions: We found no pooled benet of adjuvant acupuncture for IVF. The subgroup nding of a benet in trials with lower, but not higher, baseline pregnancy rates (the only statistically signicant subgroup nding in our earlier review) has been conrmed in this update, and wasnot explained by any confounding variables evaluated. However, this baseline pregnancy rate subgroup nding among published trials requires further conrmation and exploration in additional studies because of the multiple subgroup tests conducted, the risk of unidentied confounders, the multiple different factors that determine baseline rates, and the possibility of publication bias. Key words: acupuncture / assisted conception / complementary medicine / in vitro fertilization / systematic review Introduction Some 10-15% of couples have difculty conceiving at some point in their reproductive lives, and seek specialist fertility care ( Evers, 2002 ). One of the most commonly used treatment options is IVF and related expan- sions of it [e.g. ICSI ( ESHRE Capri Workshop Group, 2007 )]. For the year 2003, it was estimated that 932 000 IVF and related cycles were per-formed worldwide, resulting in an estimated 232 000 babies being born(Nygren et al., 2011 ). The USA has among the highest IVF success rates worldwide, which is likely due to a combination of factors, including fewrestrictions on the number of embryos that can be transferred and theroutine use of embryo selection ( Abdalla, 2010 ;Nygren et al., 2011 ). European countries generally have lower IVF success rates becausethey are increasingly moving towards single embryo transfers ( Gerris, 2005 ;Maheshwari et al., 2011 ) which carry lower health risks (Pinborg, 2005 ); the rates of multiple births and the associated health risks for mother and baby in Europe are approximately half of those inthe USA ( Nygren et al., 2011 ). Despite many recent technological advances, average success rates with IVF remain low, with only 30% of treatment cycles resulting in a live birth in the USA ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011 ). Consequently, there is a need to investigate new laboratory tech- niques and drug therapies to improve the success rates of IVF, by meansother than increasing the number of embryos transferred. However, progress in developing such safe and effective therapies has beenlimited ( Harper et al. , 2012 ), driving patients to consider IVF adjuvant complementary and alternative medical (CAM) therapies ( Smith et al., 2010 ), many of which are unproved and inadequately investigated. Acu- puncture is the most commonly used adjuvant CAM fertility treatment among couples seeking fertility care in US fertility clinics ( Smith et al., 2010 ;Domar et al., 2012 ). 'Fertility problems' is the second mostcommon health condition, following pain-related conditions, for whichpeople seek acupuncture treatment in the UK ( Hopton et al., 2012 ). A review of the effects of adjuvant acupuncture on IVF is warranted because acupuncture has been found to be relatively safe among general patient populations ( Witt et al., 2011 ) and also among women at various stages of pregnancy ( Smith et al., 2002 ;Kvorning et al., 2004 ;Elden et al., 2005 ), it is low cost, and, if effective in increasing IVF success rates, could potentially reduce the need for an additional high cost IVF cycle. Furthermore, qualitative research suggests that adjuvantacupuncture may help IVF patients deal with the psychological and emo- tional issues that accompany both subfertility and IVF treatment ( de Lacey et al., 2009 ;Kovarova et al., 2010 ;Smith et al., 2011 ;Isoyama et al., 2012 ). We updated our previous systematic review and meta-analysis (Manheimer et al., 2008 ) with nine new trials including 2672 new rando- mized participants, and carried out an a priori dened set of subgroup analyses to evaluate whether estimates of the effects of adjuvant acu- puncture on IVF success rates is influenced by study design-, treatment-and population-related factors. Methods The systematic review protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database of prospectively registered systematic reviews (identication number:CRD42011001309) in May 2011 ( Manheimer et al., 2011 ). The systematic review follows PRISMA reporting guidelines ( Moher et al., 2009 ). Identication of studies We searched Medline (OVID), Embase (Elsevier Sciences), CENTRAL(2012, Issue 4) (OVID), and the Chinese databases Sino-Med (previouslycalled the Chinese Biomedical Database), Chinese National Knowledge2 Manheimer et al. at Johns Hopkins University on June 27, 2013 http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from Infrastructure, and VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals, from in- ception to April 2012 (the MEDLINE search strategy is available from theauthor). We also searched the proceedings of the following three majorannual conferences on assisted reproductive technology for 2001-2012:American Society for Reproductive Medicine; European Society of HumanReproduction and Embryology; and Pacic Coast Reproductive Society.We also searched for previous systematic reviews on this topic, and reviewedtheir reference lists ( Cheong et al., 2008 ,2010 ;El-Toukhy et al., 2008 ;Man- heimer et al., 2008 ;Nget al., 2008 ;El-Toukhyand Khalaf, 2009 ;Sunkara et al., 2009 ;Quet al., 2012 ;Zheng et al., 2012a ,b). In addition, we sent the provi- sional list of included and excluded trials to experts in the eld (see Acknowl-edgements), and asked if they were aware of any potentially eligible trials,published or unpublished, that were not on our list. To identify trials thatmay be relevant for future updates of this review, we also searched the fol- lowing databases of ongoing trials: the US National Institutes of Health's clin- icaltrials.gov, the World Health Organization's International Clinical TrialsRegistry Platform, and controlled-trials.com. Selection criteria, data extraction and quality assessment We sought randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture or no adjuvant treatment. Because we evaluated acu-puncture as a complement to embryo transfer, we considered only RCTs inwhich acupuncture was administered within 1 day of the procedure, with theobjective of improving IVF success rates. Trials that included ICSI as part ofthe IVF procedure were eligible. We excluded RCTs which evaluated electrical acupuncture as an alterna- tive to conventional anaesthesia for the surgical procedure of removing theoocytes from the woman's ovaries. We considered these two sets ofRCTs to be fundamentally different, in terms of the aim of the treatmentwith acupuncture, the timing of acupuncture administration (i.e. duringoocyte retrieval versus embryo transfer) and the acupuncture protocolused. That is, when acupuncture is used during oocyte retrieval, theprimary purpose is to relieve pain, and correspondingly, electrical stimulationof the needles is always used ( Ulett et al., 1998 ) and the points are selected to effect pain reduction. In contrast, when acupuncture is used to accompanyembryo transfer,the primary purpose isto assistconception, electrical stimu-lation of the needles may or may not be used, and the points are selected toimprove blood flow to the uterus to make it more receptive to the embryo(Stener-Victorin et al. , 1996 ). In addition, two systematic reviews ( Kwan et al., 2013 ;Stener-Victorin, 2005 ) have already evaluated electroacupunc- ture as an alternative to anaesthesia during oocyte retrieval, and pooledanalyses found no statistically signicant differences in later pregnancy ratesbetween the electroacupuncture and conventional anaesthesia groups. We included only trials in which acupuncture involved the insertion of needles into traditional meridian points. The needles could be insertedinto tender points in addition to the traditional meridian points, and theneedles could also be electrically stimulated. We included RCTs in any language, published as either full articles or abstracts. We also included any unpublished trials that we identied, butonly if we were able to obtain sufcient and reliable information on theirmethods and outcomes. For trials to be eligible, we had to be able to extract data on at least one of the following outcomes, as recommended ( Daya, 2003 ;Griesinger et al., 2004 ;Arce et al., 2005 ): clinical pregnancy [i.e. presence of at least one ges- tational sac or fetal heartbeat, conrmed by transvaginal ultrasound(Zegers-Hochschild et al., 2006 )], ongoing pregnancy (i.e. pregnancy beyond 12 weeks of gestation, as conrmed by fetal heart activity on ultra-sound) or live birth. Two authors independently selected articles and extracted data, with dis- agreements resolved by discussion. We extracted data pertaining to thequality of the methods, participants, interventions and outcomes. We con-tacted corresponding authors with specic questions related to the designand outcomes of their trials and asked them to review the information weextracted from their trials and clarify any ambiguities. We evaluated the methodological quality of the trials using the Cochrane risk of bias tool ( Higgins and Altman, 2011 ), supplemented with an additional item that assessed whether there was a co-intervention that was applied un-equally across treatment groups. We added 'unequal co-intervention' to theCochrane tool because this item can indicate an important source of bias andhas been included in other quality assessment tools ( van Tulder et al., 2003 ), including an assessment tool used in subfertility meta-analyses ( Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group, 2010 ). Data synthesis and analysis The pooled risk ratio (RR) of achieving a clinical pregnancy for women inthe acupuncture group compared with women in the control group wasthe primary outcome measure. We prespecied clinical pregnancy insteadof live birth as our primary outcome because it would allow for moreRCTs and more data to contribute to our primary analyses, as only 22% of subfertility RCTs that report the clinical pregnancy outcome data also report the live birth outcome data ( Clarke et al., 2010 ). Therefore, including clinical pregnancy as the primary outcome will avoid the risk of including in theprimary analysis only a subset of the RCTs (i.e. only those RCTs that reportlive births), which may not be representative of all RCTs included in thereview ( Manheimer et al., 2008 ). In addition, clinical pregnancy is a practical and clinically relevant surrogate for live birth because /difference84% of clinical pregnancies achieved through IVF would be expected to result in a livebirth, based on data from IVF RCTs ( Clarke et al. , 2010 ). Also, the effect estimates on the clinical pregnancy outcome have been shown to be nearlyidentical to the effect estimates on the live birth outcome for IVF RCTsthat report both outcomes [i.e. ratio of odds ratios: 0.99 (95% condenceinterval (CI), 0.87-1.13)] ( Clarke et al., 2010 ). Finally, the clinical pregnancy outcome may allow for easier control of potentially confounding factors,which might be introduced after the rst trimester, once the women areno longer under the care of the IVF clinic. That is, collecting reliable informa-tion about live births after patients have left the IVF clinic might be difcultbecause patients, who may travel long distances to reach the clinic, mightbe less accessible to the clinic staff after the clinical pregnancy is achieved(Daya, 2003 ;Arce et al., 2005 ;Clarke et al. , 2010 ). Ongoing pregnancy, live birth and spontaneous abortion rates were analysed as secondaryoutcomes. For pooled data, summary test statistics were calculated using the DerSimonian and Laird model ( DerSimonian and Laird, 1986 ;Deeks and Higgins, 2010 ), which is the random effects model used in the RevMan soft- ware, version 5.1 ( The Nordic Cochrane Centre. The Cochrane Collabor- ation, 2011 ). This model estimates the average treatment effect by incorporating heterogeneity among clinically diverse trials with different,but related, treatment effects. When heterogeneity exists, the modelassigns smaller studies more weight than they would receive in a xedeffects model ( Deeks et al. , 2011 ). We used the random effects model because of the expected heterogeneity of the studies' acupuncture protocolsand settings. We evaluated heterogeneity using both the I 2statistic, which indicates the proportion of variability across trials not explained by sampling variation alone, and the P-value of the x2test of heterogeneity ( Deeks et al., 2011 ). Although interpreting the importance of inconsistency depends on other factors in addition to the I2values (e.g. P-value from x2test, magnitude and direction of effects), the Cochrane Handbook suggests the following rough guide to interpreting I2values: '0-40% might not be important; 30- 60% may heterogeneity; 50-90% may 75-100% may represent considerable hetero-geneity' ( Deeks et al., 2011 ).Effects of acupuncture on IVF pregnancy rates 3 at Johns Hopkins University on June 27, 2013 http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from We included in the meta-analyses all randomized women who began the IVF process including those who did not complete the treatment (i.e. had no embryo transfer), even if these participants were excluded in the author'sanalysis of the trial. Although inclusion of women without an embryo transferwill tend to underestimate the effect of acupuncture ( Daya, 2003 ), it is the more conservative and appropriate analytical approach ( Daya, 2003 ;Grie- singer et al., 2004 ;Deeks et al., 2006 ;Dias et al., 2006 ) because it preserves the groups created by the randomization and reduces the chance of a type Ierror ( Daya, 2003 ). The only randomized participants we did not include were those for whom the clinical pregnancy or live birth outcome datawere missing. We analysed the sham-controlled and no adjuvant treatment-controlled trials separately, but if there was no large or signicant difference in pooledeffect estimates between these two subgroups of trials, we pooled all avail- able trials. If at least 10 trials were available for a meta-analysis, we assessed for the likelihood of publication bias by constructing funnel plots ( Sterne et al., 2011 ). Subgroup analyses We conducted subgroup analyses on ve clinical characteristics that might in- fluence the effect of adjuvant acupuncture on clinical pregnancysuccess rates:(i) two acupuncture sessions or more than two; (ii) selection of meridian acu-puncture points the same as the points selected in the rst published trial(Paulus et al., 2002 ) that evaluated acupuncture as an adjuvant to embryo transfer, and which showed a large effect, or a modied version of thistrial's acupuncture point selection protocol; (iii) control group clinical preg-nancy rate (as an estimate of the baseline clinical pregnancy rate) dichoto-mized as higher [32% or greater, which is the European average ofpregnancy rate per embryo transfer ( de Mouzon et al., 2012 )] or lower; the control group clinical pregnancy rate was also analysed as a continuousvariable to test whether the relation was linear and consistent with the nd-ings of the categorical analysis; (iv) explanatory trials conducted to test theeffects of adjuvant acupuncture under controlled conditions in which the acu-puncture was administered onsite at the IVF clinic or pragmatic trials con-ducted to test the effects of adjuvant acupuncture delivered off-site, whichmight better approximate every day, 'real life' conditions since most IVFclinics do not have onsite acupuncturists ( Arce et al., 2005 ); and (v) trials that involved a treating acupuncturist who was judged as adequately experi-enced or not adequately experienced, with such judgments made by acu-puncturist assessors who were blinded to the identities and results of thetrials. In addition, to assess whether the effects varied with the risk of bias domains of the trials, we also conducted subgroup analyses ( Deeks et al., 2011 ) on the following six 'risk of bias' domains: random allocation sequence generation; concealment of allocation of randomization sequence; blinding ofpatients (i.e. use of sham control); blinding of embryo transfer physicians; in-complete outcome data; and unequal co-intervention. For each subgroup analysis, we performed a single covariate weighted random effects meta-regression ( Thompson and Higgins, 2002 ;Knapp and Hartung, 2003 ;Higgins and Thompson, 2004 ) in Stataversion 11 (StataCorp) (Harbord and Higgins, 2008 ) to investigate whether differences in effects of adjuvant acupuncture between the covariate's two subgroups were statistic-ally signicant. In interpreting the importance of subgroup effects, we also considered the difference in the magnitude or direction of effect between the two subgroups as well as whether or not the CIs of the subgroups over-lapped ( Deeks et al., 2011 ). For each single covariate meta-regression sub- group analysis, we calculated the P-value of the test for interaction; the percentage of the between-study variance explained by the covariate(adjusted R 2); and the percentage of the residual variation that is attributable to between-study heterogeneity (I2 res).A random effects meta-regression model was used rather than a xed effects model or univariate subgrouptesting because the random effects meta-regression model allows for poten- tial residual heterogeneity and it is therefore a more conservative analyticalapproach. We did not attempt to develop a multivariate meta-regressionmodel, primarily because of the relatively small number of studies relativeto the number of subgroup variables prespecied, but also because our ob-jective was to identify modiers of the effects of adjuvant acupuncture on IVF,rather than to build an optimal 'prediction' model. A major limitation of sub-group analyses is the potential bias by confounding ( Thompson and Higgins, 2002 ). Therefore, we also examined whether the apparent effect modica- tion due to a specic subgroup variable might be explained by an associationbetween that subgroup variable of interest and a potentially confounding sub-group variable, by including both variables in a meta-regression model. Sensitivity analyses For our primary analyses, we excluded participants with unrecorded clinical pregnancy data; however, for sensitivity analyses, we imputed the rate of clin- ical pregnancies in participants with unrecorded outcomes using availablecase rates: (i) from the corresponding trial group that these participantswere assigned to (i.e. either acupuncture or control); and (ii) from the corre-sponding trial's acupuncture plus control group combined. We also con-ducted a third sensitivity analysis which assumed that no randomizedparticipants with an unrecorded outcome achieved a clinical pregnancy. Results Supplementary data, Fig. S1 shows the study selection process. The list of studies that were excluded with the reasons for exclusion and the list of characteristics of the ongoing trials are available from the author. Sixteen RCTs with a total of 4038 participants met the inclusion cri- teria (Table I; full details of the trials are available from the author). All trials were published in English since 2002, and were conducted inseven different countries. Ten were published as full reports ( Paulus et al., 2002 ;Dieterle et al., 2006 ;Smith et al., 2006 ;Westergaard et al., 2006 ;Domar et al., 2009 ;Soet al., 2009 ,2010 ;Andersen et al., 2010 ;Madaschi et al., 2010 ;Moy et al., 2011 ) and six were published as abstracts ( Paulus et al., 2003 ;Craig et al., 2007 ;Fratterelli et al. , 2008 ;Arnoldi et al., 2010 ;Omodei et al., 2010 ;Feliciani et al., 2011 ). We obtained unpublished methodological information for all trials, and unpublished live birth outcome data for seven trials ( Paulus et al., 2002 ,2003 ;Dieterle et al., 2006 ;Westergaard et al. , 2006 ;Craig et al., 2007 ;Arnoldi et al., 2010 ;Omodei et al., 2010 ). Trial characteristics The only differences in trial eligibility criteria were that: two German trials (Paulus et al., 2002 ,2003 ) included only women with good-quality embryos whereas the other trials included women with embryos of varying quality; one trial ( Arnoldi et al., 2010 ) restricted eligibility to women with an unfavourable reproductive prognosis; one trial ( So et al., 2010 ) restricted eligibility to frozen-thawed embryo transfer cycles while the others used fresh embryos; and one trial ( Madaschi et al., 2010 ) used ICSI forall participants, whereas all other trials reported use of ICSI for only some participants. The timing of the acupuncture sessions relative to embryo transfer dif- fered somewhat among trials (Table I). In all trials, however, women received acupuncture on the day of embryo transfer, before and/orafter the embryo transfer procedure. In all but one trial ( Craig et al., 2007 ), the acupuncture was administered directly on-site of the IVF clinic. The number of acupuncture treatments ranged from one to4 Manheimer et al. at Johns Hopkins University on June 27, 2013 http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from .............................................................................................................................................................................................Table I Characteristics of included trials.

In all trials, the acupuncture sessions lasted 25-30 min. In all trials, the acupuncture protocol and selection of acupuncture points was designed for the sole purpose of improving rates of pregnancy. Twelve trials reported that the 'de qi' needling sensation (i.e. a pain, achiness, stinging or dullness at the needle insertion site, which is anindicator that the acupuncture needle has been correctly placed) was sought ( Paulus et al., 2002 ,2003 ;Dieterle et al., 2006 ;Smith et al., 2006 ;Westergaard et al., 2006 ;Craig et al., 2007 ;Soet al., 2009 ,2010 ;Arnoldi et al., 2010 ;Madaschi et al. , 2010 ;Feliciani et al., 2011 ;Moy et al., 2011 ), whereas one sham-controlled trial reported that there was no attempt to manipulate the needles to achieve the 'de qi' needling sensation, in order to avoid unblinding trial participants ( Andersen et al., 2010 ). The three other trials did not report on de qi ( Fratterelli et al. , 2008 ;Domar et al., 2009 ; Omodei et al., 2010 ). No trial used electroacupuncture. For all trials, the mean numbers of embryos transferred was similar between therandomized groups. Methodological quality of included trials A summary of the risks of bias is presented in Table II; full details of the quality assessments are available from the authors. For one trial(Madaschi et al., 2010 ), the method of generating the random allocation sequence was not clear; however, the randomization appeared to be successful in creating similar groups, as there were no baseline differ- ences in prognostic factors between treatment groups. For the other15 trials, adequate methods of sequence generation were used. For three trials ( Arnoldi et al., 2010 ;Madaschi et al., 2010 ;Feliciani et al., 2011 ), there was inadequate allocation concealment (Table II), but in these trials there was also baseline similarity between the two groups.In three trials ( Westergaard et al., 2006 ;Craig et al., 2007 ;Moy et al., 2011 ), there were small numbers of randomized women with missing clinical pregnancy outcomes (Fig. 1, footnotes). In four trials ( Smith et al., 2006 ;Westergaard et al., 2006 ;Craig et al., 2007 ;Madaschi et al., 2010 ), some randomized women began the IVF process but did not complete the treatment (that is, no embryo transfer); however, asnoted above, these women were still included in the meta-analyses. Seven of the trials used a sham acupuncture control ( Paulus et al., 2003 ;Dieterle et al., 2006 ;Smith et al., 2006 ;Soet al., 2009 ,2010 ;Andersen et al., 2010 ;Moy et al., 2011 ), of which four ( Paulus et al., 2003 ;Soet al., 2009 ,2010 ;Andersen et al. , 2010 ) the needles and Kleinhenz, 1998 ;White et al., 2003 ) placed on the true acupuncture points (Table I). The remain- ing nine trials used a no adjuvant treatment control. For 10 trials, theembryo transfer physicians were blinded to the treatment assignments (Paulus et al., 2002 ,2003 ;Dieterle et al., 2006 ;Craig et al., 2007 ; Domar et al., 2009 ;Soet al., 2009 ,2010 ;Andersen et al., 2010 ;Madaschi et al., 2010 ;Moy et al., 2011 ); for the other six trials the physicians were not blinded ( Smith et al., 2006 ;Westergaard et al., 2006 ;Fratterelli et al., 2008 ;Arnoldi et al., 2010 ;Omodei et al., 2010 ;Feliciani et al., 2011 ; Table II). Efcacy analysis There were no statistically signicant pooled benets of adjuvant acu-puncture relative to either control, for the clinical pregnancy, ongoingpregnancy or live birth outcomes; however, the overall statistical hetero- geneity was substantial for each outcome ( 68%; x2 P-value\u00bc0.0001, 0.0004 and 0.0003, respectively; Fig. 1). The type of control used did not signicantly explain this statistical heterogeneity(interaction P\u00bc0.27, for clinical pregnancy outcome; Fig. 1). Of the 11 variables planned for subgroup analyses for the clinical preg- nancy outcome, only 10 could be tested because no trial had a high risk ofbias from incomplete outcome data. In addition, only the Craig et al. (2007 ) trial used an 'unequal co-intervention', which was driving to and from the off-site acupuncturist's ofce, before and after theembryo transfer procedure, in only the acupuncture group. Therefore, the 'unequal co-intervention' and 'site of acupuncture administration'variables classied trials in the same subgroups, and therefore had the same subgroup effect results. We combined all 16 trials for the meta-regression subgroup analyses. Of the 10 subgroup variables tested, only baseline clinical pregnancy ratewas a statistically signicant effect modier of adjuvant acupuncture (Fig. 2). Baseline pregnancy rate was also the only variable tested that explained a large proportion of the between-study variance.

The approach for our meta-analysis was to re-include these participants [i.e. acupuncture group \u00bc230 (i.e. 208 +22) and the no acupuncture group \u00bc225 (i.e. 208 +17)], because it could be assumed that these participants without an embryo transfer did not achieve the clinical pregnancy outcome. gFor this trial, acupuncture groups 1 and 2 were combined together for the meta-analysis.6 Manheimer et al. at Johns Hopkins University on June 27, 2013 http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from and the adjusted R2\u00bc93% when the baseline pregnancy rate was oper- ationalized as a dichotomous variable (interaction P,0.001).

In none of these nine other models did the correlation coefcient of thebaseline clinical pregnancy rate variable substantially change (i.e. the maximum percentage change of the coefcient was 7%). To investigate whether the effect modication of baseline pregnancy rate wasmaintained across trial subsets, we also t six separate single covariate(i.e. baseline pregnancy rate) meta-regression models, restricting tosubsets of trials, according to type of control (sham or no adjuvant treat- ment), blinding of embryo transfer physician (yes or no) and allocation concealment (yes or no). In these meta-regression models, the magni-tude of the baseline pregnancy rate subgroup effect was maintained when restricting to: sham-controlled trials [76% difference in RR esti- mates between sham-controlled trials with higher (RR \u00bc0.89), com- pared with sham-controlled trials with lower (RR \u00bc1.65), baseline pregnancy rates; interaction adjusted R (63% difference in RR; P\u00bc0.012;.............................................................................................................................................................................................Table II Risk of bias summary of included trials.

Therefore, the 146 participants analysed were instead used in the authors' analysis ( Domar et al., 2009), and for this meta-analysis. However, we scored this criterion as 'low risk' for incomplete outcome data because the reasons for missing outcome data were unlikely to be related to the outcomes and the proportion of missing outcomes was not likely to have a clinically relevant impact on the effect estimates ( Higgins and Altman, 2011 ). dA computer-generated randomization list was used to assign patients to treatment groups. However, this trial was judged as unclear for 'allocation sequence generation' because it was not clear how the trial authors assigned to treatment groups 39 new participants who replaced the 39 participants excluded because of no embryo transfer. eThis trial used an open randomization list, so the investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias. fIn this trial, the randomization occurred prior to the start of the ovarian stimulation, although the participants were not informed of their treatment assignment until the start of the ovarian stimulation. Approximately 15% of participants were randomized, but then decided not to get IVF, primarily because of its costs and withdrew prior to the start of the ovarian stimulation.Because these participants withdrew from the study before they were told whether they had been randomized to acupuncture or control, their decision to withdraw from the trial could nothave been affected by knowledge of the randomized intervention (i.e. acupuncture or control), and these withdrawals would not be expected to cause an important bias due to missing outcome data ( Higgins and Altman, 2011 ). gFor this trial, the randomization treatment assignments were placed in sealed, opaque envelopes, which were shuffled and deposited in a cardboard box, from which each participant selected only one. This procedure has handled by an independent nurse not responsible for obtaining information about patients and enrolling them. Although the envelopes were not sequentially numbered, we considered the safeguards used in the randomization process to have provided adequate assurance of allocation concealment.Effects of acupuncture on IVF pregnancy rates 7 at Johns Hopkins University on June 27, 2013 http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from Figure 1 Effects of acupuncture on clinical pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy and live birth outcomes.

Figure 3shows a graph of the meta-regression line, t with the single continuous covariate of baseline pregnancy rate. This meta-regressionmodel showed that a 20 and 40% increase in baseline pregnancy ratewas associated, respectively, with a 33 and 55% decrease in the RR of clinical pregnancy with adjuvant acupuncture. A 20 and 40% decrease in baseline clinical pregnancy rate was associated, respectively, with a49 and 122% increase in the RR of clinical pregnancy. The subgroup variables 'blinding of embryo transfer physician' and 'site of acupuncture administration' were borderline statistically signi-cant across all trials (interaction P\u00bc0.084 and 0.096, respectively); however, neither variable explained a large proportion of thebetween trial variability (adjusted R 2\u00bc22 and 19%, respectively). Because the trials that blinded the embryo transfer physician also tended to blind the patients (i.e. use a sham control; see Table II), we were concerned about confounding between these two variables. Therefore, we also t a meta-regression model which included the patient blinding variable in addition to the embryo transfer physician blinding variable. In this model which included both variables, thecorrelation coefcient of the embryo transfer physician blinding vari-able was not substantially changed (i.e. from 20.158 to 20.150), and the interaction P-value of the embryo transfer blinding covariate only increased slightly (i.e. from P\u00bc0.084 to P\u00bc0.15). Finally, because the only trial that evaluated acupuncture administeredoff-site of the IVF clinic ( Craig et al., 2007 ) used a no adjuvant treat- ment control, we also t a meta-regression model using the single cov-ariate of site of acupuncture administration, but restricting to the noadjuvant treatment-controlled trial subset. In this meta-regression model, the site of acupuncture administration covariate was statistic- ally signicant (interaction P\u00bc0.04), and this covariate explained some of the heterogeneity within this subset of trials (adjusted R 2\u00bc 61%). The embryo transfer blinding variable was not a statisticallysignicant effect modier when restricting to the sham-controlled(interaction adjuvant treatment-controlled ( P\u00bc 0.246) trial subsets. Although we initially planned subgroup analysesstratied by control type, we combined all trials for our nal subgroupanalyses shown in Fig. 2because of the largely similar subgroup effects across the two control groups. The funnel plot (Fig. 4) showed small study effects, with the interven- tion effects estimated in smaller studies showing more benet than the effects estimated in larger studies. The Egger statistical test for funnel plot asymmetry found that the association between estimated interven-tion effects and the standard error of the intervention effect (as a measure of the trial's size) was greater than would be expected to occur by chance ( P\u00bc0.032). Figure 1 Continued.Effects of acupuncture on IVF pregnancy rates 9 at Johns Hopkins University on June 27, 2013 http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from Sensitivity analyses The use of the different methods of imputing the unrecorded outcome data values did not affect the results of the individual trials, any of the pooled results or the results of any of the subgroup analyses. In trials that had participants with unrecorded clinical preg-nancy outcomes ( Westergaard et al., 2006 ;Craig et al., 2007 ; Moy et al., 2011 ), imputing these values using available case rates from the corresponding trial group that these participants were assigned to resulted in very similar pooled estimates for the primary outcome measure (RR \u00bc1.12; 95% CI, 0.96-1.30; I 2\u00bc68%; 16trials). Imputing the values using the corresponding trial's acupunctureplus control group combined resulted in identical pooled estimates.Assuming that no participants with an unrecorded outcome achieved a clinical pregnancy resulted in very similar pooled estimates (RR \u00bc 1.13; 95% CI, 0.96-1.31; I 2\u00bc69%; 16 trials). Safety of acupuncture Figure 5shows the spontaneous abortion rates calculated as the number of losses between clinical pregnancy and live birth divided by the number of clinical pregnancies. Similar results were obtained when calculating Figure 2 Meta-regression subgroup analyses for the primary outcome (i.e. clinical pregnancy). The quadrilaterals represent pooled estimates from the trials included in the given subgroup. The estimated regression coefcient from each model was obtained by a weighted least squares meta-regression with RR of pregnancy as the dependent variable, using the modication to the variance of the estimated coefcient suggested by Knapp and Hartung ( 2003 ), and supported by Higgins and Thompson ( 2004 ).I2 residvalues indicate the proportion of the residual variation that is attributable to between-study heterogen- eity. The adjusted R2values indicate the proportion of between-study variance explained by the covariate. The P-values for test of interaction indicate whether the observed differences in results of trials within a given subgroup are compatible with chance alone. *The So 2010 trial was the only trial that used only one acupuncture treatment session. The Westergaard 2006 trial had two acupuncture treatment arms, one arm received two sessions andthe other arm received three, and these arms were grouped separately for this subgroup analysis. Incomplete outcome data were also prespecied as a methodological subgroup variable, but no trial had a high risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data for the clinical pregnancy outcome.Only the Craig et al. trial was judged to have a co-intervention that was applied unequally across treatment group. Namely, in this trial, which evaluated off-site acu- puncture, patients in the acupuncture group only were required to drive to and from the off-site acupuncturist's ofce both before and after the embryotransfer procedure.10 Manheimer et al. at Johns Hopkins University on June 27, 2013 http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from spontaneous abortion rates as losses between clinical pregnancy and ongoing pregnancy (across all trials, RR \u00bc1.01; 95% CI, 0.76-1.35; I2\u00bc0%; 11 trials). A total of seven trials ( Dieterle et al., 2006 ;Smith et al., 2006 ;Craig et al., 2007 ;Soet al., 2009 ,2010 ;Omodei et al., 2010 ;Moy et al., 2011 ) included descriptions of other adverse events, but none of these trials reported any serious adverse events associatedwith acupuncture.Discussion Summary of main results We found no statistically signicant pooled benets of one to three ses-sions of acupuncture adjuvant to IVF, across all trials, or when restrictingto sham-controlled or no adjuvant treatment-controlled trials. However, there was substantial ( Deeks et al., 2011 ) heterogeneity. Of the 11 variables prespecied for subgroup analyses, only the baseline pregnancy rate variable showed a statistically signicant subgroup effect and appeared to explain most of the heterogeneity in the results for the primary outcome measure (clinical pregnancy). Subgroup analyses based on clinical characteristics Baseline pregnancy rate was the only statistically signicant subgroup nding in our previous review on this topic ( Manheimer et al., 2008 ) and this has been conrmed in this review update. The magnitude of this subgroup effect is large and there is a low likelihood that chance explains this apparent subgroup effect. In addition, this subgroup effect does not appear to be due to an association between baseline pregnancyrate and either blinding- or randomization-related covariates, or any of the other prespecied covariates. The reasons for differences in baseline (i.e. control group) pregnancy rates across trials are complex and driven by several factors, althoughthese differences may be largely explained by differences in IVF regula- tions across countries, in particular, regarding the number of embryostransferred per cycle ( Ludwig et al., 2000 ;Dal Canto et al., 2006 ; Abdalla, 2010 ;Maheshwari et al., 2011 ). That is, European countries have lower IVF pregnancy rates than does the USA, and a major Figure 3 Meta-regression with baseline clinical pregnancy rate as single continuous covariate. Outcome was RR of clinical pregnancy. Circle size represents weight each study was given in themeta-regression analysis. For this meta-regression, the adjustedR 2\u00bc90% and the I2 resid=3.3%.

The intervention effect estimated from individual trials is plotted on the horizontal scale and a measure of the standard error of the intervention effect is plotted on the vertical axis. The control groupsuccess rate is included foreach trial on the plot. The Egger test P-value for funnel plot asymmetry is 0.032.Effects of acupuncture on IVF pregnancy rates 11 at Johns Hopkins University on June 27, 2013 http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from reason for this difference is that fewer embryos are transferred per cycle in European countries than in the USA ( Maheshwari et al., 2011 ), in an effort to reduce twins and triplets ( Abdalla, 2010 ). In Italy and Germany, the country setting of six of the eight included EuropeanRCTs, the average IVF pregnancy rates are lower than in other Europeancountries because of Italian/German laws which set a limit of using only three ooctyes per IVF cycle, all of which must be transferred, regardless of whether these oocytes develop into high-quality embryos ( Ludwig et al., 2000 ;Gerris, 2005 ;Dal Canto et al., 2006 ;Maheshwari et al., 2011 ). In the USA, on the other hand, embryo selection ( Alpha Scientists in Reproductive Medicine and ESHRE Special Interest Group ofEmbryology, 2011 ) is routine and the number of embryos that can be transferred is less strict and less well-regulated ( Abdalla, 2010 ). Another reason for higher baseline pregnancy rates in the USA is thatUS patients with poor ovarian reserve (i.e. those who produce fewer oocytes and end up with fewer embryos to transfer or chose from) are more likely to be diverted from undergoing IVF ( Abdalla, 2010 ). Differ- ences in baseline pregnancy rates can also be due to differences in inclu- sion criteria across trials. For example, one Italian trial in this review (Arnoldi et al., 2010 ) restricted trial inclusion to women with an un- favourable reproductive prognosis, which might explain why the baseline pregnancy rates in this Italian trial were lower than Italian nationalaverages ( Nygren et al., 2011 ). Two German trials ( Paulus et al., 2002 , 2003 ) restricted trial inclusion to only women with high-quality embryos available to transfer, which might explain why the baseline preg-nancy rates in these German trials were higher than German national averages ( Nygren et al., 2011 ). Finally, differences in baseline pregnancy rates across included trials can also be due to participant selection in the individual trials, in terms of participants' predictors for success in IVF (van Loendersloot et al., 2010 ). Namely, for two of the trials with lower baseline pregnancy rates ( Dieterle et al., 2006 ;Smith et al., 2006 ), the trial authors reported that the trials' baseline pregnancy rates were lower than the average pregnancy rates at the trials' clinicsbecause of the higher mean age of the participants included in the trials relative to the mean age of patients seen at the clinic site. And for one of these two trials ( Smith et al. , 2006 ), the trial authors also reported an overrepresentation by women with poor pregnancy outcomes from previous cycles. Thus, there are multiple factors that can explain differences across trials in baseline pregnancy rates. One potentialexplanation for the differential effect of acupuncture in trials with higher versus lower baseline rates may be that in IVF settings where the baseline pregnancy rates are already high, the relative added valueof additional co-interventions, such as acupuncture, may be lower (Sherman et al., 2009 ). Figure 5 Effects of acupuncture on spontaneous abortion outcome. The centres of the squares represent estimates from individual trials, the centres of the quadrilaterals represent pooled estimates, and the horizontal lines represent 95% CIs.12 Manheimer et al. at Johns Hopkins University on June 27, 2013 http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from Although it was not a statistically signicant subgroup nding, there was a trend suggesting that acupuncture administered on-site of the IVF clinic had more positive effects than acupuncture administered off-site of the IVF clinic. However, inferences regarding this observed dif-ferential effect areweakbecause only a single trial ( Craig et al., 2007 ) con- tributes to the off-site subgroup. The qualitatively and quantitativelydifferent results in the off-site Craig et al. trial, which had very high base- line pregnancy rates (i.e. 67%), could have been driven by another vari- able, other than the off-site acupuncture administration. One potential biological rationale for the negative results of the Craig et al. trial, postu- lated by the trial's principal investigator ( Sullivan, 2007 ), is that the co-intervention, in only the acupuncture group, of driving to and fromthe off-site acupuncturist's ofce, both before and after the embryotransfer, rather than resting in bed, may have increased patients' stress, which may have affected pregnancy success rates negatively through a psychobiological effect mechanism ( Ferin and Vande Wiele, 1984 ;Stener-Victorin et al., 1996 ;Matthiesen et al., 2011 ). However, studies of the effects of stress on IVF success rates have had inconsistentresults, and the influence of psychological stress on IVF success appearslimited, at best ( Matthiesen et al., 2011 ). In addition, while resting in bed for 2 or 3 days after the embryo transfer procedure has been recom-mended by some IVF physicians on the theory that bed rest canprevent the embryo from being expelled from the uterus, there is no evi- dence to support this recommendation ( Liet al., 2011 ). Thus, the support from a biological rationale for this putative subgroup effect regarding on- versus off-site acupuncture is unconvincing. However, because only a single trial has evaluated off-site acupuncture, and because Craig et al. conducted this trial specically to address whether the positive ndings from the earlier Paulus et al. (2002 ,2003 ) trials, which involved on-site acupuncture could be conrmed in 'real world'off-site settings ( Sullivan, 2007 ), and because this Craig et al. trial found a reduction in pregnancy rates with off-site adjuvant acupuncture com- pared with no IVF adjuvant treatment, IVF physicians and patients may wish to consider this trial's ndings in deciding whether IVF patientsshould have off-site acupuncture on the day of embryo transfer. Subgroup analyses based on risk of bias Seven of the trials ( Paulus et al., 2003 ;Dieterle et al., 2006 ;Smith et al., 2006 ;Soet al., 2009 ,2010 ;Andersen et al., 2010 ;Moy et al., 2011 ) used a sham control to blind participants. However, the necessity to blind par-ticipants is arguable when the outcomes are entirely objective (that is, pregnancy and birth) ( Hrobjartsson and Gotzsche, 2004 ;Kaptchuk et al., 2006 ;Manheimer et al., 2008 ;Wood et al., 2008 ). Indeed, the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group website statesthat 'a study may not be blinded but if follow-up is complete and out- comes are unequivocal the lack of blinding may be assessed not to in-crease risk of bias' ( Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group, 2010 ). As previously argued ( Manheimer et al., 2008 ; Manheimer, 2011 ), it seems unlikely that a woman's knowledge of whether or not she was receiving acupuncture would affect her ability to become pregnant. Even if adjuvant acupuncture were to increase IVF success rates strictly through a non-needling-related psychobiologic-al placebo effect mechanism (i.e. women who believe they are receiving acupuncture have reduced stress, which thereby subtly influences their pregnancy-related hormone production), this effect would be integralto the working mechanism by which adjuvant acupuncture increasesIVF pregnancy success rates. Therefore, it seems inappropriate tocontrol for and equalize any such stress-reduction placebo effect by using a sham control to blind trial participants, unless the purpose of the trial isto study the mechanism responsible foradjuvant acupuncture'seffects on IVF success rates. The risk of using a sham control is that some sham interventions may influence the pregnancy outcome through the same putative mechanismof true acupuncture (e.g. by needle insertion, stimulation of true acu- puncture points; Manheimer, 2011 ). For example, the sham interven- tion used in four of the sham-controlled trials ( Paulus et al., 2003 ; Soet al., 2009 ,2010 ;Andersen et al., 2010 ) was the non-penetrating Streitberger sham needles placed at the true acupuncture points. The two validation trials ( Streitberger and Kleinhenz, 1998 ;White et al., 2003 ) of this Streitberger sham needle found that these Streitberger sham needles elicit the de qi needling sensation in a large proportionof patients, suggesting that these sham needles may have acupuncture-specic needling effects, particularly if the Streitberger sham needles are manipulated in the same way as the true acupuncture needles, as was the case in two of the included sham-controlled trials ( Soet al., 2009 , 2010 ). W e initially attempted to assess whether or not the sham control intervention used in each trial was likely to have a risk of affectingthe pregnancy outcome through the same putative mechanism of trueacupuncture; however, because no consensus could be reached in making these assessments, the assessments could not be used in the analyses. Instead, our subgroup analysis test involved grouping all sham-controlled trials together in a single subgroup; however, some sham control interventions may be physiologically active, and others physiolo- gically inert, in terms of their effects on the pregnancy outcome, andtherefore this subgroup test (i.e. no adjuvant treatment versus any type of sham control) may not detect an important effect of control type. Finally, although this review found no statistically signicant sub-group effect for the type of control, the no adjuvant treatment- controlled subgroup showed a slightly larger pooled effect than the sham-controlled subgroup, particularly if the outlying Craig et al. trial was removed [RR 1.31 (1.08-1.58); I 2\u00bc49%; 8 trials]. Therefore, the possibility that some of the sham interventions may have hadacupuncture-specic effects cannot be ruled out. Although it was not a statistically signicant subgroup nding, there was a trend suggesting that IVF physicians who are not blinded mayperform more successful embryo transfers when adjuvant acupunc-ture is used, at least in a trial setting. This subgroup nding was unex- pected because, considering the cost of embryo transfer and the importance of successful transfers to maintaining high pregnancysuccess rates at clinics, we a priori expected that physicians would be motivated primarily to perform a successful embryo transfer forall trial participants, rather than to show that acupuncture, a non-proprietary treatment, is an effective adjuvant procedure. Indeed, in IVF trials, where outcomes are objective, blinding of either patients or physicians is 'infrequently attempted' ( Arce et al., 2005 ), and such blinding components are often not considered as critical ele- ments related to the evaluation of risk of bias ( Vail and Gardener, 2003 ;Dias et al., 2006 ). Yet, this borderline signicant subgroup nding suggests that physician blinding may decrease bias, and there-fore this variable may possibly be appropriate for inclusion in scales that assess risk of bias of IVF trials. However, blinding the embryotransfer physician still does not require the use of a sham acupuncture control ( Paulus et al., 2002 ;Craig et al., 2007 ;Domar et al., 2009 ;Effects of acupuncture on IVF pregnancy rates 13 at Johns Hopkins University on June 27, 2013 http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from Madaschi et al., 2010 ) because the adjuvant acupuncture is not admi- nistered at the same time as the embryo transfer procedure. Interpretation of small study effects The funnel plot indicated that estimates of the intervention effect were more benecial in smaller studies, which may be due to smaller studies with statistically signicant, positive results being more likely to be pub- lished (i.e. publication bias). Funnel plot asymmetry can also be due toother types of reporting bias besides publication bias (e.g. language bias, multiple publication bias, publication of negative results only as con- ference abstracts). However, in this review, these other types of report-ing bias seem less likely than publication bias, given our extensive searches (including Chinese databases and conference proceedings), and our contacts with the authors of included trials, which conrmedthat none of these trials are duplicate publications. Although we attempted to locate any unpublished trials by contacting experts in the eld, none were located, and the possibility of unidentied, unpublishedstudies with negative results is one possible explanation for the asymmet- ric funnel plot. However, the Cochrane Collaboration's guidelines for addressing reporting biases and interpreting funnel plot asymmetrystress that 'an asymmetric funnel plot should not be equated with publi- cation bias', and that 'publication bias should a number of possible explanations' ( Sterne al., 2011 ). Also according to Cochrane guidelines, 'Funnel plot asymmetry ...may also result from clinical heterogeneity between studies (for example different controlevent rates) ...'(Alderson and Green, 2002 ). We therefore added the control event rates to the funnel plot, and the resulting plot shows that the trials with the lowest control group success rates show the most positive results (Fig. 4). Therefore, it is impossible to know whether the funnel plot asymmetry is due to publication bias, or whether this pattern is due to greater benets in the trials with lower control group success rates ( Alderson and Green, 2002 ). We also tried to identify other potential explanations for the funnel plot asymmetry. Namely, we prepared separate funnel plots (and con-ducted corresponding separate Egger tests) for the sham-controlledtrial subgroup and the no adjuvant treatment-controlled trial subgroup. These separate tests found that the funnel plot asymmetry seemed to be driven largely by the sham-controlled trials (Egger P\u00bc0.028 for sham- controlled trials and P\u00bc0.303 for no adjuvant treatment-controlled trials). Cochrane guidelines suggest that funnel plot asymmetry may bedue to larger 'negative'trials (conducted laterto conrm the earlier 'posi-tive' trials' results) using a more effective control treatment or a less thor- oughly implemented test intervention ( Sterne et al., 2011 ). Therefore, this issue was examined among the sham-controlled trials that contribu- ted to the funnel plot asymmetry. Namely, three of the largest sham- controlled trials ( Soet al., 2009 ,2010 ;Andersen et al., 2010 ), which all had 'negative' results, used non-penetrating Streitberger sham needles placed at the true acupuncture points as the control intervention. For two of these trials ( Soet al., 2009 ,2010 ), these sham needles were manipulated in the same way as the true acupuncture needles. The author of these two trials discussed that this sham control interven- tion used was likely an effective treatment due to its acupuncture- specic effects, and a conclusion of their 2009 trial was that 'Placeboacupuncture may not be inert' ( Soet al., 2009 ). For the third and largest trial ( Andersen et al., 2010 ), for which the acupuncture was per- formed by nurse-acupuncturists and other nursestrained by these nurse-acupuncturists, the true acupuncture needles were not manipulated, inorder to avoid unblinding the patients to treatment assignment. There- fore, in these three recent, large sham-controlled trials with 'negative' results, manipulating the needles in the sham acupuncture group ( So et al., 2009 ,2010 ) and/or not manipulating the needles in the true acu- puncture group ( Andersen et al. , 2010 ) may have caused the control trea tment to be an effective treatment and/or the test intervention to be less effective. This possibility is particularly relevant in light of a recent trial which found that manipulating the acupuncture needles to obtain the 'de qi' sensation resulted in a much greater therapeuticeffect compared with not manipulating the needles (odds ratio \u00bc4.16, for primary outcome; Xuet al., 2013 ). The use of a potentially more ef- fective control and/or less thoroughly implemented test intervention inthese three large sham-controlled trials with 'negative' results is only one of many possible explanations for the funnel plot asymmetry among the sham-controlled trials. This example is provided primarily to illustrate thechallenges in interpreting funnel plot asymmetry in meta-analyses of complex interventions that used heterogeneous treatments and con- trols, when the funnel plot test was devised on the premise that thestudies come from a single underlying population ( Terrin et al., 2003 ; Sterne et al., 2011 ). Comparison with other studies or reviews Although there have been multiple systematic reviews of acupuncture asan adjuvant to IVF ( Cheong et al., 2008 ,2010 ;El-Toukhy et al. , 2008 ; Manheimer et al., 2008 ;Nget al., 2008 ;El-Toukhy and Khalaf, 2009 ; Sunkara et al., 2009 ;Qu et al., 2012 ;Zheng et al., 2012a ), only the 2012 reviews by Zheng et al. (2012a ) and Qu et al. (2012 ) included some of the more recent trials. And therefore, comparisons with the Zheng et al. review and Qu et al. review are most relevant. The Zheng et al. review concluded that adjuvant acupuncture improves clinical preg- nancy rates and live birth rates, but only after excluding the Streitbergersham needle-controlled trials. Zheng et al. excluded these trials in drawing their conclusions because they contended that the Streitberger sham intervention is not an inert control; however, Zheng et al. did not provide evidence to support this contention. Also, because the Zhenget al. review was not based on a publicly available protocol, it cannot be determined whether the decision to exclude the trials using the Streit- berger shams was prespecied, or whether instead this exclusion was driven by the Streitberger sham-controlled trials' results. In addition,the Zheng et al. review, as well as all other previous systematic reviews, were based on only the published data, with the exception ofone previous review ( El-Toukhy et al., 2008 ) for which two RCT authors ( Craig et al., 2007 ;Domar et al., 2009 ) were contacted and sup- plied additional information. We have successfully obtained unpublisheddata on methods and/or outcomes from authors of all eligible RCTs,which allowed for the inclusion of more RCTs and more complete infor- mation from these included RCTs. For example, Zheng et al., excluded two methodologically sound RCTs ( Omodei et al., 2010 ;Moy et al., 2011 ) because the 'data for the exact pregnancy events and totals were not available' from the publication; however, we were able to obtain precise outcome data for these two RCTs by contacting theauthors. Finally, Zheng et al., included both the early results from one trial ( Benson et al., 2006 ), as well as the nal results ( Fratterelli et al., 2008 ), thus double counting some of the same participants from this14 Manheimer et al. at Johns Hopkins University on June 27, 2013 http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from trial. The other 2012 review, by Qu et al., concluded that no benets of adjuvant acupuncture were apparent from the effect estimate pooled from all trials. However, the Qu et al. review did not include six of the RCTs included in our review ( Fratterelli et al., 2008 ;Arnoldi et al., 2010 ;Madaschi et al., 2010 ;Omodei et al., 2010 ;Soet al., 2010 ;Feliciani et al., 2011 ), four of which ( Fratterelli et al., 2008 ;Arnoldi et al., 2010 ; Omodei et al., 2010 ;Soet al., 2010 ) were published prior to October 2010, the end date of Qu et al.'s search window. Also, Qu et al. did not examine potential subgroup variables to understand their impact on the effects of adjuvant acupuncture on IVF, on the clinically and meth-odologically heterogeneous trials reviewed. In contrast, the detailed in- formation we obtained allowed us not only to evaluate potential effect modication due to the prespecied subgroup variables, but also toexamine whether other subgroup variables were confounders of any ap- parent subgroup effects. Implications for research Future studies might further investigate the relationship between base-line rate of pregnancy and the efcacy of adjuvant acupuncture, and also further investigate which variables are responsible for this relation-ship. Because baseline pregnancy rate is possibly a proxy for the number of embryos transferred, although other factors are also involved (Abdalla, 2010 ), an individual patient data meta-analysis ( Broeze et al., 2010 ) may be helpful to further investigate the relationship between the number of embryostransferred, as well as other individual participantlevel variables (e.g. age ( Westergaard et al. , 2006 )), and the efcacy of adjuvant acupuncture. For future trials, if the objective is to investigate the mechanism of IVF adjuvant acupuncture, and specically whether any effect ismediated through the point-specic needle placement, or alternatively through a non-needling-related psychobiological placebo mechanism, both a sham control arm and a no adjuvant treatment arm wouldbe necessary. A sham control arm might also be necessary for recruit- ment, if potential trial participants would be unwilling to be rando- mized to a no adjuvant treatment control ( Smith et al., 2012 ). However, because it is difcult to assess whether or not a sham control intervention has acupuncture-specic effects that may increase IVF success rates, sham-controlled trials in this area can also potential-ly complicate the interpretation of the overall evidence ( Manheimer, 2011 ). For addressing the more clinically relevant question of the total effects of acupuncture (i.e. specic needling effects plus anynon-needle-related placebo effects) in contributing to any increases in IVF pregnancy success rates, a sham control seems unnecessary (Manheimer, 2011 ). This question about the need for sham controls may also apply to other invasive, difcult to blind adjuvant procedures evaluated in IVF RCTs ( Holt et al., 2009 ).

In our Study on Integrative Medicine Treatment Approaches for Pain (SIMTAP), we observed the impact of an integrative approach on chr onic pain and a number of other related patient-reported outcome measures. Methods Our prospective, non-randomized, open-label observational evaluation was conduct ed over six months, at nine clinical sites. Participants received a non-s tandardized, personalized, multimodal approach to chronic pain. Validated instruments for pain (s everity and interference levels), quality of life, mood, stress, sleep, fatig ue, sense of control, overall well- being, and work productivity were completed at baseline and at six, 12, a nd 24 weeks. Blood was collected at baseline and week 12 for analysis of high-sensit ivity C-reactive protein and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Repeated-measures analysis was perf ormed on data to assess change from baseline at 24 weeks. Results Of 409 participants initially enrolled, 252 completed all follow-up visi ts during the 6 month evaluation. Participants were predominantly white (81%) and female ( 73%), with a mean age of 49.1 years (15.44) and an average of 8.0 (9.26) years of chronic pain. At baseline, 52% of patients reported symptoms consistent with depression. At 24 weeks, si gnificantly decreased pain severity (23%) and interference (28%) were seen. Signifi cant improvements in mood, stress, quality of life, fatigue, sleep and well-being were al so observed. Mean 25- hydroxyvitamin D levels increased from 33.4 (17.05) ng/mL at baselin e to 39.6 (16.68) ng/mL at week 12. Conclusions Among participants completing an integrative medicine program f or chronic pain, significant improvements were seen in pain as well as other relevant patient-reported out come measures. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01186341 Keywords Integrative medicine, Chronic pain, Patient-reported outcomes, Complementary th erapies, Musculoskeletal disorders Background A 2011 Institute of Medicine report, Relieving Pain in America , estimates that chronic pain affects nearly 116 million American adults, a staggering number tha t surpasses those affected by heart disease, cancer, and diabetes combined [1]. The report concl udes that chronic pain costs between $560 billion and $635 billion annually in medical expenses and lost productivity. Although there have been some therapeutic advances, many pat ients with chronic pain become resistant to conventional medical treatments or suffer adverse effects from widely used prescription medications with high addictive potentia l, such as non- steroidal anti-inflammatory agents or opiates. For these reasons, pa tients with chronic pain frequently seek to integrate complementary therapies, often without t he knowledge of their primary care provider [2-4]. Integrative medicine provides patient-centered care and addresses the full range of physical, emotional, mental, social, spiritual, and environmental influences that affect a person's health [5]. Employing a personalized strategy that considers the pati ent's unique conditions, needs, and circumstances, integrative medicine uses the most appropriate i nterventions from an array of scientific disciplines to heal illness and help people re gain and maintain optimum health. Because integrative medicine is a \"whole systems\" appro ach that employs multiple modalities in concert as opposed to an isolated complementary therap y, studying outcomes is more challenging than evaluating an isolated pharmaceutical or bot anical intervention. Chronic pain is one of the main reasons patients seek care at integ rative medicine clinics [6,7]. In an effort to capture data on patient-reported outcomes in integrati ve medicine, a number of leading integrative medicine clinics have collaborated to form the first practice-based research network in the field: the Bravewell Integrative Medici ne Research Network (BraveNet). BraveNet's initial project was to characterize 4182 patients seeking care at nine clinical sites in a systematic fashion by collecting informa tion at a single time point [6]. This repository of data confirmed the high utilization of integrative medi cine by chronic pain patients and informed the present Study on Integrative Medicine Trea tment Approaches for Pain (SIMTAP). We report the impact of a six-month integrative approach on chronic pain and a number of other related patient-reported outcome measures. Methods Design overview Using a prospective, non-randomized, open-label observational design, we as sessed patients at baseline and six-, 12-, and 24-week visits. At baseline, participant s completed a demographic questionnaire as well as the instruments utilized to assess outcomes over the duration of the study. Within a week of each projected follow-up data collection visit, participants were asked to complete the battery of questionnaire s collected at baseline. Information on integrative interventions, prescription medications, and vita mins and supplements utilized was collected at each study visit. Questions about integrative modalities being utilized were answered at weeks six, 12, and 24 to define the sc ope of the interventions received. Setting and participants Eligible patients were enrolled at each of the nine BraveNet clinical sites. Participants were clinic patients aged 18 or older who were seeking their initial t reatment at the center for chronic pain, defined as persisting for at least the past three mont hs with an average level over the past month of at least 4 of 10 on a numerical rating scale . Participants provided written informed consent before initiation of any study-related pr ocedures. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at each participating s ite including Allina Health Institutional Review Board; Beth Israel Medical Center Human S ubjects Protection Office Institutional Review Board; Duke University Health Systems Inst itutional Review Board; The Scripps Clinic Institutional Review Board; Thomas Jefferson U niversity Division of Human Subjects Protection; University of California Los Angeles Institutional Review Board; University of California San Francisco Committee on Huma n Research; and University of Maryland Institutional Review Board. Intervention In keeping with the integrative medicine philosophy of individualized patient-centered care, no standardized prespecified clinical intervention for chronic pain was prescribed for all study participants. Instead, practitioners at each of the network sites devised treatment plans for participating chronic pain patients. All BraveNet sites in clude integrative physicians, acupuncturists, mindfulness instructors, and yoga instructors; some also incorporate massage therapists, manual medicine therapists, fitness/movement specialis ts, dietician/nutritionists, psychologists, healing touch therapists, and other energy practitioners. Outcomes and follow-up The battery of validated outcome measurements collected at each visit included the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) [8], the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12v2) [9], the C enter for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) [10], the Perceive d Stress (PSS-4) [11], the Arizona Integrative Outcomes Scale (AIOS) [12], and the W ork Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) survey [13]. In addition, numerical ra ting scales were utilized to assess fatigue, restfulness of sleep, and sense of control. Venipunc ture for determination of high-sensitivity C-reactive of infla mmation) and hydroxyvitamin D levels (potentially associated with pain syndr omes) was performed at baseline and week 12. Statistical analysis An objective of this network study was to demonstrate that the s ites could enroll and follow patients over a 24-week period and collect serial laboratory specime ns. For this analysis, we focus on those participants who completed the entire 24-week program. A post hoc sensit ivity analysis was performed to determine potential differences betwe en enrolled patients completing all four study visits (\"completers\") and those who compl eted at least the baseline visit but not the entire study (\"noncompleters\"). Comparisons of basel ine characteristics were assessed utilizing t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categoric al measures. Descriptive statistics were summarized using frequencies (pe rcentages) for categorical variables. Means, standard deviations, medians, quartiles, minimums, and maximums were reported for all continuous variables. Pain and quality-of-life scales Repeated-measures analyses of variance were performed on study completers to detect changes in BPI subscales\u2014Pain Severity and Interference\u2014over tim e as well as changes in quality-of-life scores. Results are summarized with a point est imate of mean change in the outcome measures between baseline and any specified follow-up visit with 95% confidence intervals. P values are reported for overall model summary, indicating any difference between any two given points between baseline and 24 weeks. If the P value was significant (<.05), follow-up linear regression analyses were done to verify t hat the trends were consistent in direction throughout all study visits, indicating consta nt improvement or decline from visit to visit. A secondary sensitivity analysis was done to determine the impa ct of including only study completers for the primary outcome\u2014BPI Pain Severity and Inter ference scores\u2014instead of using the more conservative method of last observation carried for ward. The repeated- measures analysis for the BPI Pain Severity and Interference scores was run on three subgroups of the sample assuming that values at missed visits were carried forward from the last nonmissing study visit: (1) all enrolled patients, (2) pati ents completing at least one postbaseline study visit, and (3) patients completing all follow-up study visits. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to look at variables that influenced the pain response. Responders were defined as those with at least a 20% decrease in the BPI interference score over 24 weeks. Variables included in the model w ere age, gender, ethnicity (Hispanic or non-Hispanic), years with chronic pain, body mass inde x, and baseline values for the BPI interference score, SF-12 physical component score, SF- 12 mental component score, CES-D score, and PSS-4. Lab measures (hs-CRP and Vitamin D) We used dependent t-tests to determine whether the 12-week study visit laboratory me asures differed significantly when compared to baseline values. A P value of < .05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Results A total of 409 participants were consented and enrolled at the nine Bra veNet sites between June 2009 and November 2010. The number of participants contributing baseline data per site ranged from 22 to 65 (median: 49). Of the participants, 252 completed all study assessments during the 24-week study and are the basis of our primary analysis. Table 1 provides baseline demographics of the study completers compa red with those who did not contribute data at the 24-week visit. Regardless of completion s tatus, the majority of the participants were women, on average nearly 50 years of age a nd slightly overweight, who reported experiencing pain for about nine years (completers) or s even years (noncompleters). Other than the duration of pain, completers and noncompleters were simil ar in demographics and baseline scores on all patient-reported outcomes measured. Subsequent results are presented for the completers only.

Fifty-one percent of the participants reported pain in the neck, 49% lum bar spine, 46% shoulder, 37% and 23% foot. Multiple sites could be selected. At week 24, participants were receiving a wide range of moda lities in their prescribed integrative suite of therapies (see Table 2). Figure 1 is a m osaic plot of the modalities utilized over the course of the study. The highest number of patients receive d 4 modalities (N = 55), including acupuncture/Chinese medicine (51.9%), manipulation therapy (17.3%), mi nd/body techniques medicine consult (7.7%), exercise (7.7%), y oga (1.9%), and alternative medical systems therapy (5.8%). Overall, acupuncture /Chinese medicine, manipulation therapy, and mind/body therapy were the most commonly received modali ties. Table 2 Current integrative medicine pain treatments at 24 weeks for complet ers ( N = 252) Integrative modality group a Patients Percentage Acupuncture/TCM 115 47.3% Manipulation Therapy 51 21.0% Mind/Body 27 11.1% Integrative Medicine Consult 25 10.3% Exercise 12 4.9% Yoga 6 2.5% Alternative Medical Systems 6 2.5% Energy Therapy 1 0.4% a Individual integrative medicine modalities were gr ouped into eight categories.

Figure 1 Mosaic plot of Modalities received by Patients. The x-axis shows the number of modalities received and the width of the column is proportional to the number of patients in each category - 1 modality (n = 22 patients), 2 modalities (n = 50), 3 modalities (n = 50) , 4 modalities (n = 52), 5 modalities (n = 42), 6 modalities (n = 19), 7 modalities (n = 5), all 8 modalities (n = 3). The y-axis shows the proportion of patients who received each modalit y; the actual percentages are included in each colored box (where feasible). Current pain medications reported at week 24 Medication use was unchanged from baseline. Dietary supplements used by mo re than 10% of participants at week 24 included vitamin D (81%), fish oil (65 %), magnesium (32%), green tea (24%), glucosamine (19%), and turmeric (13%). The only cha nges from baseline in proportion of patients using supplements were seen in vitamin D, magnesi um, and glucosamine (55%, 27%, and 26% at baseline, respectively). The mean monthl y cost of supplements increased from $47 at baseline to $72 at week 24. Pain scores The BPI is composed of four items that assess pain severity and a n additional seven questions that assess how the pain interferes with life [8]. The composite score summarizes the patient pain experience over the past 24 hours, with 1-4 rated as mild, 5-6 modera te, and 7-10 severe. The mean baseline severity and interference scores in our cohort were 4.7 (1.86) and 4.7 (2.53), respectively. The overall model results for all three subgr oups in both BPI severity and BPI interference scales were statistically signific ant ( P < .001). Additionally, mean change scores between baseline and any specific post-baseline study visit for both BPI scales were significantly decreased ( P < .001). Figure 2 portrays the change in BPI scores over the study duration. Mean severity scores decreased 23% from moderate t o mild at 24 weeks. Interference scores dropped 28% to a mean of 3.3 at week 24. Figure 2 Repeated-measures analysis of primary outcome: Brief Pain Inventor y (BPI) pain scores. Reported P values are overall model results summarizing any potential change across four time points throughout the study. Individual estimated change from bas eline scores specify changes in scores from baseline to any designated study vis it on a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating least possible pain or interference. Depression, stress, and quality of life Fifty-two percent of completers scored 16 or greater on the CES-D at baseline, consistent with symptoms of depression. As seen in Table 3, by week 24 the mea n score had dropped from 17.9 to 13.8 (median score decreased from 16.0 to 11.0); at week 24, only 35% ha d scores consistent with depressive symptoms. Although both the mental and physical component scores on the SF-12v2 remained below the U.S. norm of 50 at week 24, the mean mental component score rose from 43.5 at baseline to 46.5, and the mean physi cal component score rose from 37.7 at baseline to 41.5 at week 24 ( P < .001). Similarly, stress and fatigue decreased over time, and the participants' sense of control increased (all P < .001).

The AIOS asks participants to summarize their sense of well-be ing for the entire month by marking a point on a plain line with an \"X\" somewhere between \"Wors t you have ever been\" and \"Best you have ever been.\" Participants' sense of well-being increased significantly from a baseline mean of 41.7 to 55.9 at week 24 ( P < .001). To put these values in context, rehabilitation center patients scored an average of 33 and healthy controls a 61 on the AIOS [12]. Work productivity The WPAI survey assesses the impact of an intervention with res pect to daily activity and productivity [13]. It has been previously validated that overall work producti vity is significantly related to general health perceptions. The WPAI surv ey was completed by the 145 participants who reported having employment. The results (see Tabl e 4) demonstrate improvement in all parameters over the 24-week study period.

Laboratory studies Specimens for hs-CRP and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were obtained at base line and at week 12. Mean hs-CRP decreased from 4.0 (10.21) mg/L at baseline to 2.7 (6.55) mg/L at 12 weeks. The mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D level at baseline was 33.4 (17.05) ng/mL. At week 12, the mean value had increased to 39.6 (16.68) ng/mL ( P < .001). Considering >30 ng/mL as the desirable range for 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 52% of the participants were in the desirable range at baseline, and 70% were at week 12 [14]. Predictors of response A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that patie nts with fewer years of chronic pain (p = 0.03), non-Hispanic populations (p = 0.04), and those with higher (worse) baseline BPI interference scores (p = 0.002) and SF-12 physical component scores (p = 0.008) were more likely to have a clinical meaningful response (i.e. 20 decrease in the BPI interference score over 24 weeks). Age, gender, BMI, baseline SF-12 mental component score, CES-D score, and PSS-4 score were not significant predictors of response. Discussion and Conclusion The initial project of the BraveNet practice-based research network involved collection of a one-time questionnaire from about 500 participants at each of our nine c linical sites [6]. Building on the initial experience of collecting data as a multi- site group, SIMTAP demonstrated our ability to enroll participants and capture outcomes in a prospective longitudinal study, requiring serial follow-up data collection at t hree time points beyond baseline as well as the ability to collect and process laborator y specimens. The establishment of this functioning practice-based research network in integrative m edicine is one of the main accomplishments of this endeavor. We surpassed the target enrollment of 400, with 409 participants ultimat ely enrolled. Of these, 88 (21.5%) did not contribute data at the six-week study visit. A t 24 weeks, 66% of the enrolled participants were available for follow-up. Chronic pain tria ls frequently encounter retention issues for a number of reasons, including the nature of t he population. It has been suggested that in a typical 12-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled tr ial, a dropout rate of 20%-50% is to be expected [15]. Our participants received no financial incentives for their participation in the 24-week study and, in fact, were responsible for the cost of their integrative treatments. A recent trial on a three-month yoga i ntervention versus usual care for chronic back pain randomized 156 patients to the yoga arm [16]. Of the se, 93 (60%) attended at least three of the first six sessions and at least thre e others. Acknowledging the need to improve retention, we conclude that within the context of chronic pain int ervention trials, the practice-based research network is successful in recruiting and retaining patients who contribute data to assess the impact of the interventions on patient-r eported outcomes of interest in a usual care (non-efficacy) setting. Our study demonstrates that an integrative approach to treating chronic pain had a significant impact on patients' pain as well as on associated symptoms and qua lity of life. This success was in the context of long-standing chronic pain, with an average durati on in our sample of greater than eight years. Whereas conventional medical interventi ons, such as pharmaceuticals or surgery, generally focus on one outcome, integra tive interventions have the potential to affect multiple aspects of health and well-being [17]. It has been recommended that additional patient-recorded outcome measures are a lso important to monitor, particularly in studies of chronic pain [18]. The trends in decr eased pain, stress, depression, and fatigue, and improvement in physical quality of life a nd overall well-being, were consistent over the 24-week duration of the trial and suggest the possibility of sustainable effects of the integrative interventions [19]. Parti cularly notable is the decrease in severity of participants' depression symptoms, given what is known about the challenges of treating chronic pain and depression. In addition, findings on the WPAI sur vey suggest that the improvements measured in patient-reported outcomes also translat ed into greater productivity at work. Predictors of response to an integrative medici ne approach included years of chronic pain, ethnicity, and baseline BPI interference and SF-12 physical component scores. We investigated hs-CRP as a general marker of inflammat ion rather than as a predictor of cardiac risk [20,21]. The mean hs-CRP value declined one point, suggesting a trend toward decreased inflammation. In a previous study on musculoskeletal pain c onducted at our Minneapolis BraveNet site, 93% of the participants were found to ha ve insufficient levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 20 ng/mL) [22]. To further assess the relationship of hypovitaminosis D to pain, we included vitamin D levels in SIMTAP. Ou r patients presented with baseline vitamin D levels higher than those seen in the pri or study and in the average American adult [21,23]. This likely reflects awareness among both pati ents and practitioners of the increasing importance of adequate vitamin D levels. The findings that 70% of SIMTAP participants had values greater than 30 ng/mL and none were deficie nt at week 12 reflect the serious attention paid to maintaining sufficient vitamin D in integrative medici ne practices. Limitations One limitation of this study is the loss to follow-up. Our result s describe the outcomes of 252 participants at nine sites who completed all study visits during the 24-week integrative medicine intervention for chronic pain. It could be argued that these completers were somehow different from the noncompleters, skewing the final study res ults, although this notion is not supported by the sensitivity analysis. The bulk of patients lost failed to return for the first study follow-up at week six. This may represent patie nts who were \"shopping\" for a new approach for their chronic pain, visited one of the centers, enrol led in SIMTAP, and then chose not to return for follow-up care. The 252 completers can be consider ed as being treated \"on protocol\" for analysis in this prospective non-randomized open-label intervention. A second limitation is the absence of a control group. It could be ar gued that the significant benefits we observed in SIMTAP participants may have nothing to do wit h the integrative intervention per se. Because we did not control for natural history and the passage of t ime, we cannot estimate what proportion of the observed benefits would have occurred separately from the intervention themselves. Without a control group of equal attenti on, it could be argued that the benefits observed were related to the degree o f attention participants received at our centers. Because one of our goals was to assist in the de velopment of our practice- based research network and to demonstrate that we could recruit, foll ow, and retain participants, as well as collect and process laboratory specimens , we opted not to include randomization or comparison to a control group in our design. In the spirit of the individualized care that characterizes the i ntegrative medicine approach to the unique individual, we did not mandate a standardized intervention for all SIMTAP participants. Although this makes it more difficult to define the pr ecise treatment that patients received, the network felt that the personalized treatment plan w as preferred. Practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine generally devise individualized tre atment plans based on each patient's unique diagnosis rather than follow a standard intervention base d on the complaint. In a seminal randomized controlled trial of Chinese herbal medici ne for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, investigators compared a standard and an individualized Chi nese herbal formulation to a placebo [24]. Results showed that compared with patient s in the placebo group, patients in the two active treatment groups had improvements in bowel symptoms as rated by both the patients and their gastroenterologists at the end of the 16-week intervention. However, at follow-up 14 weeks after completion of the treatment, only the individualized herbal medicine treatment group maintained improvement. Future directions The results of SIMTAP suggest that the tailored, multi-modal a pproach to treating chronic pain combining conventional and complementary therapies improves quality of life and reduces pain, stress and depressive symptoms. The components of integrat ive medicine that contribute to improving patients' physical and emotional health require further research since this study is not powered to compare the effectiveness of different combinations to each other. In addition, a comparison of integrative medicine to usual care w ould help define the effectiveness of different treatment approaches to chronic pain. Investigating the therapeutic impact of a \"whole systems\" approa ch such as our integrative intervention is a daunting challenge, as funding agencies are acc ustomed to a more reductionist approach to assessing which individual component of a multimoda lity intervention is the active one. In addition, the conventional approach would be to deliver a standardized intervention to all study participants. These conventions run counter to the philosophy of integrative medicine, which places the needs of the unique pe rson seeking care first and designs an appropriate personalized intervention based on the i ndividual's assessment, much akin to practitioners of traditional Eastern medicine. New initiatives, such as the Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System and the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, will hopefully have an impact in advanc ing research of integrative medicine interventions [25-28]. The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act required the Depa rtment of Health and Human Services to enlist the Institute of Medicine in examining pa in as a public health problem. The recommendations from the institute suggest that among th e \"steps to improving care, healthcare providers should increasingly aim at tailoring pain care to each person's experience, and self-management of pain should be promoted\" [1]. Although it is often easier and faster to respond to the patient presenting with chronic pain by wr iting a prescription, increasingly for a substance with addictive potential, an integr ative medicine approach may more closely approximate the Institute of Medicine's blueprint for transform ing health care.

Methodology Committee of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI): Methodological standards and patient-centeredness in comparative effectiveness research: and cupping, important in traditional Eastern medicine, are increasingly used in the West. Their widening acceptance demands continual safety assessment. This review, a sequel to one our team published 10 years ago, is an evaluationofthefrequencyandseverityofadverseevents(AEs)reportedforacupuncture,moxibustion,andcuppingbetween2000and 2011. Relevant English-language reports in six databases w ere identified and assessed by two reviewers. During this 12-year period,117reportsof308AEsfrom25countriesandregionswereassociatedwithacupuncture(294cases),moxibustion(4cases),or cupping(10cases).Countryofoccurrence,patient'ssexandage,andoutcomewereextracted.Infections,mycobacterial,staphylo-coccal, and others, were the main complication of acupuncture. In the previous review, we found the main source of infection to be hepatitis, caused by reusable needles. In this review, we found the majority of infections to be bacterial, caused by skin contact at acupoint sites; we found no cases of hepatitis. Although the route of infection had changed, infections were still themajor complication of acupuncture. Clearly, guidelines such as Clean Needle Technique must be followed in order to minimize acupunctureAEs. 1. Introduction Traditionalacupuncture,which at acupuncture points [ 1], has become popular in the United States and the rest of the world in recent decades.Data released by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in2008 reported that 3.1 million American adults and 150,000childrenusedacupuncturein2007.Adultuseofacupunctureincreasedbyapproximatelyamillionpeopleinthefiveyearsfrom2002to2007[ 2].Thisincreasedusebringsattentionto thesafetyandqualityofthemodality. A number of large surveys on the safety of acupuncture havebeenconducted,mainlyinEurope.Mostreportedinci-dents have been fairly minor, and incidence rates were low.For example, in a prospective survey of 34,000 treatments by traditional acupuncturists, MacPherson et al. [ 3]f o u n d no serious adverse events (AEs) and 43 minor ones, a rateof 1.3 per 1000 treatments. In another prospective survey,Melchart et al. [ 4] found 7.1% minor AEs and 5 serious ones a m o n g9 7 , 7 3 3a c u p u n c t u r ep a t i e n t s .Th ea u t h o r so ft h e s estudies concluded that serious AEs seem to be rare and thatacupunctureisgenerallyasafeintervention.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. Only original case reports of complications or AEs of acupuncture, moxibus-tion,andcuppingpublishedfrom2000to2011wereincludedin this review. Two authors independently screened thetitles and abstracts of all papers found from the initialsearch.Disagreementsbetweenthetwoauthorswereresolved throughdiscussion. Weexcludedmultipleinclusionsandanalysesofthesame AE as well as irrelevant studies. An irrelevant study wasdefined as a non-case report, such as a review, commentary,orclinicaltrial. AEs reporting infection, internal organ or tissue injury, and other severe consequences are categorized as \"compli-cations,\" defined as an added difficulty; a complex state;a disease or accident superimposed upon another without beingspecificallyrelated.Peripheralorsecondaryeffectssuch as syncope, nausea, or immune reactions are classified as\"adversereactions\"[ 5]. 2.3. Data Extraction. At o t a lo f1 6 1 3p a p e r sw e r ef o u n d ; 117 were relevant (Figure 1). When provided, we extracted author,yearofpublication,countryofoccurrence,numberofpatients affected, disease originally treated, preexisting con-ditions that might have contributed to the AE, the needlingsite, the reported AE and its outcome, the practitioner'straining, and the patient's status at followup. The majority ofthe reports did not give the date of the AEs. The data wereextracted by two independent coauthors, double checked toensurematching,andorganizedbywhethertheAEswere(1)complicationsor(2)adversereactions.Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 3 Table1:Adverseeventsassociatedwithacupuncture,moxibustion, Adverseevents Pneumothorax 13Centralnervesystem 9 7 Othercomplications 7 Adverse reactions 10Moxibustion 4 Cupping 10 Total 308 3. Results Fortheyears2000-2011,atotalof117reportscontaining308 AEs associated with acupuncture (294 cases), moxibustion(4 cases), and cupping (10 cases) were identified from 25countriesandregions(T able 1). 3.1. Acupuncture Complications: Infections. At o t a lo f2 3 9 reported cases were infections associated with acupuncture. These include 48 individual isolated cases reported in 45 papers (Table 2)a n d1 9 1c a s e sr e p o r t e di nfi v eo u t b r e a k s (Table3).Incidentswerereportedin17countriesandregions. Koreareported162cases,Canada33,HongKong7,Australia8 ,J a p a n5 ,T a i w a n5 ,U K4 ,U S A6 ,S p a i n1 ,I r e l a n d1 ,France1,Malaysia1,Croatia1,Scotland1,Venezuela1,Brazil1, and Thailand 1. Most of the papers did not report thepractitioner'straining,but4casesweretreatedbyindividualswith no medical training or license [ 6,7]. One patient with a knee infectiondied due to renalfailure[ 8]. All other cases recoveredaftertheinfectionwastreated. 3.2. Mycobacterium Infection. Of the 239 cases of infection, 193 (80.75%; 153 from Korea, 32 from Canada, 5 from HongKong,1fromVenezuela,1fromBrazil,and1fromSpain)wereassociatedwithmycobacterium. In 2006, Song et al. reported an outbreak of 40 cases of infection in an Oriental medicine clinic in Republic ofKorea. Although disposable acupunctureneedles were used,the patients developed skin lesions at two or more sites onthe body; infections were confirmed by laboratory culture,clinicalsigns,andhistopathology.Allpatientsrecoveredafteractive treatment with antibiotics. Reportedly, these patientsreceivedhot-packtherapyandgelmassageafteracupuncturetreatment. No further cases were found in that clinic afterequipmentsterilization,andregulartowelchangeswereinsti- tuted. The authorsof thereportconcludedthatthe outbreakof infection was due to improper sterilization of equipmentapplied to the skin after withdrawal of acupuncture needles[52]. In2006,Tangetal.reportedanoutbreakofacupuncture- associated bacterial infection in Canada. Between April and December 2002, thirty-two patients developed cutaneousmycobacteriosis after visiting an acupuncture practice inToronto. Interviews with the patients and acupuncturistrevealed that needles were reused and kept in a container ofglutaraldehyde disinfectant prior to insertion. The solutionwas no longer available at the time of the investigation butwasprobablyimproperlydilutedwithtapwater[ 51]. In 2009, Koh et al. reported an outbreak of 109 cases of skin and soft tissue infection in an acupuncture clinic inRepublicofKorea.Mostpatientshadatleastoneskinlesion.Investigators determined that disposable acupuncture nee-dleswereusedandwereunlikelytobethesourceofinfection.Infectedpatientswerealltreatedbyaphysicaltherapycalled\"interferential current therapy\" or \"low-frequency therapy.\"The authors found that the diluted disinfectant used tosanitizethetherapeuticequipmenthadbeenpreparedseveralmonths earlier and was contaminated with Mycobacterium abscessus,thelikelysourceoftheoutbreak[ 54]. Woo et al. reported four cases of infection by alcohol- resistantmycobacterium,discoveredoveratwo-yearperiod,inpatientswithskinlesionswhowerereceivingacupuncturetreatment in Hong Kong (Table 3). The patients had clin- ical and/or radiological lesions at acupuncture points. The acupuncturists' training and whether disposable acupunc- ture needles were used were not reported. The authorsrecommended that proper infection control guidelines foracupunctureshouldbemandatoryandstrictlyimplemented[50]. 3.3. Staphylococcus Infection. Nineteen cases from 14 case reports concern staphylococcus infections associated withacupuncture[ 14,15,17,21,25,27,28,30,33,38,39,46,47,53]. Ofthese,ninepatientswereinfectedbymethicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus (MRSA): six from Australia [ 53], one fromKorea[ 33], one from Taiwan [ 47], from Hong Kong [38]. IntheAustraliancase,Murrayetal.reporteda2008out- breakofeightcasesofinvasiveMRSA,sixofthemassociatedwithacupuncture(Table 3).Afterextensiveinvestigation,the authorsconcludedthattheoutbreakmostlikelyresultedfrom a breakdown in sterile technique during the acupunctureprocedureandthattheMRSAwasprobablytransmittedfrom the medical practitioner to the patients. At two time points fifteen months apart, that practitioner had been positivelycolonized with the MRSA strain that caused the infection[53]. 3.4. Other Infections. Other infections (31 cases) include septic arthritis [ 10,23,31,39], necrotizing fasciitis 2002 [ 50] HK 4 Alcohol-resistantmycobacteria Notspecified Recovered Tang 2006 [ 51] Canada 32 Mycobacteriosis Acupuncturist Recovered Song2006[ 52] Korea 40 Mycobacteriosis Orientalmedicalclinic Recovered Murray 2008 [ 53] Australia 6 MRSA Acupuncturist Recovered Koh 2010 [ 3.5. Acupuncture Complications: Organ and Tissue Injuries. Of 38 cases of organ or tissue injuries, 13 were pneumotho-raxes(Table 4);9werecentralnervesysteminjuries(Table 5); 4 were peripheral nerve injuries (Table 6); 5 were heart injuries (Table 7); 7 were other organ and tissue injuries (Table8).Thecasesweredistributedamongtencountries:10 from South Korea, 6 from the USA, 6 from Taiwan, 5 fromJapan,3fromtheUK,2fromGermany,2fromHongKong,1fromAustria,1fromIran,1fromSingapore,and1fromNewZealand. Although most papers did not report the trainingbackground of the practitioner, 3 cases were reportedlytreatedbyindividualswithnomedicaltrainingorlicense[ 55- 57]. 3.6. Pneumothorax (Table 4).Of 13 cases of pneumothorax [58-70] associated with acupuncture, the USA reported 3,t h eU K2 ,H o n gK o n g2 ,J a p a n2 ,S i n g a p o r e1 ,G e r m a n y1 , Taiwan 1, and New Zealand 1. Most of these were reported byemergencyroomphysicians.Themajorpatientcomplaintswere dyspnea and chest pain; pneumothorax was confirmedbyX-ray.Allbutoneofthe13patientsrecovered.A72-year-oldwomandied90minutesafteranacupuncturetreatment;autopsy confirmed cause was needle penetration ofthethoraciccavity[ 60]. 3.7.CentralNervousSystemInjury(Table 5).Therewerenine cases of central nervous system injury, including five spinalcord injuries [ 55,73-75,77] and four of brain injury [ 56,71, 72,76]. Twoofthespinalinjurieswerecausedbymigratingbro- ken needles [ 55,75]; the others to needle insertion; the medulla injury was caused by a (Table 6).Four reported cases o fperi p h eraln erv ein j uryw er ur etreatment [ 78-81] ,o n ee a c hi nJ a p a n ,K o r e a ,t h eU S A ,a n d the UK. The injured nerves were the peroneal nerve viaacupuncturepointGB34themediannerveviaPC5andPC6,thefacialnerveviaST7andST8,andtheL5nerverootviaabrokenneedleinthelumbarregion.Allpatientsrecovered. 3.9. Heart Injury (Table 7).Five cases of heart injury include two of cardiac tamponade [ 82,83], one of the hemopericardium [ 57], one embolism [ 84], and one myocardial injury [ 85]. Of these, two were due to the migration of embedded needles [ 83,84]a n dt w ow e r e due to needle insertion [ 57,82]. Two were caused by an acupuncturist or TCM practitioner, and one by an \"unau-thorized acupuncturist\" [ 57]. The status of two practitioners was unreported. Three patients recovered; outcome was notreportedintheothertwocases. 3.10. Other Organ and Tissue Injuries (Table 8).Seven cases of other organ and tissue injuries were found: a pseudoa-neurysm of the abdominal sheath hematoma [90],earhematomas[ 91],andapoplitealarteriovenousfistula [92]. The patient with acute traumatic pancreatitis had been treatedwith13cmneedlesplacedatthreesitesontheanteriorabdominalwall.Abdominalcomputedtomographyrevealedsmall multiple gold acupuncture needles on the anteriorabdominal wall and back muscles. The patient's conditionquickly improved with fasting and intravenous fluids [ 88]. Onepatientdied[ 89]. 3.11. Other Complications of Acupuncture. Seven other complications associated with acupuncture were reported(Table9): bilateral hand edema [ 93], sites [ 99]. The localized argyria and pancytopenia were caused by needles embedded 20 and 17 years earlier,respectively [ 96,98 ], in a type of Japanese acupuncture reported in our previous review [ 5]. The epithelioid granulomas were caused by silicone coating on the needles[94]. The scars were due to a hot needle technique in which theneedleswereheatedinfirebeforeinsertion[ 99]. 3.12. Adverse Reactions Associated with Acupuncture. Ten cases of adverse reactions from acupuncture were found(Table10): three of syncope from two reports [ 100,101]; two of galactorrhoea (spontaneous milk flow) [ 102,103]; one of bilateralnystagmus[ 104];oneofpyodermagangrenosumdue toimmunereaction,inwhichthetissuebecamenecroticanddeep ulcers eruptive lichen 107]; one of spontaneous needle migration [ 108]. These unusual cases are uncommonly seen in regular acupuncture practice. The case report authorspostulated that these AEs were likely caused by a rare physi-ologicalreactiontotheacupunctureneedle.Forexample,thecase report of spontaneous needle movement involved the acupuncture needles having \"spontaneously moved deeper as far as the hilt, travelling an extra depth of 5-10mm,\"whichwasobservedrepeatedlyonthesamepatient.Althoughthere was no resulting complicating in this case, the authorscautioned that this could have caused serious complicationsiftheneedleshadbeenplacednearavitalorgan[ 108]. Thesyncopecasesoccurredimmediatelyorseveralmin- utes after a first acupuncture treatment; the patients weresittingorsemirecumbentduringtreatment[ 100,101]. 3.13. Complications Associated with Moxibustion. Four AEs associated with moxibustion were found (Table 11): bruising [109], burns \"untrained individual\" p e r f o r m e dt h et h i r d[ 110]; there was no information on the fourth[109]. 3.14. AEs Associated with Cupping. Ten AEs associated with cuppingwerefound(Table 12):fourfromTurkey,threefrom Korea, two from Taiwan, and one from the UK. Most wereminor: keloid scarring [ 113], burns were serious: acquired hemophilia A [ 118], stroke 14 hours after cupping on the back and neck [ 119], factitious panniculitis [ 120], reversible cardiac hypertrophy [ 121], and iron deficiency anemia [ 122]. These last two cases involved cupping with bleeding [ 121,122]. In six cases, there wasnoinformationonpractitionertraining;intheotherfour,treatmentwasself-administered. 4. Discussion Our primary objective in reviewing case reports of AEsassociated with acupuncture has been to identify individualc a s e sa n do u t b r e a k so fA E sa n dt oa n a l y z et h e i rp o s s i b l ecauses, in order to minimize future acupuncture AEs andenhance safe practice within the profession. How do theobjectivesandresultsofthisreviewfitinthecontextofotheravailable literatures on the safety of acupuncture? Incidence rates for major AEs of acupuncture are best estimated from largeprospectivesurveysofpractitioners.Fourrecentsurveysof acupuncture safety among regulated, qualified practition-ers, two conducted in Germany [ 4,123]a n dt w oi nt h e UnitedKingdom[ 3,124],confirmthatseriousadverseevents after acupuncture are uncommon. Indeed, of these surveys,covering more than 3 million acupuncture treatments alltogether, there were no deaths or permanent disabilities,a n da l lt h o s ew i t hA E sf u l l yr e c o v e r e d[ 125]. Thus, it can be concluded that acupuncture has a very low rate of AEs,when conducted among licensed, qualified practitioners inthe West. Recent systematic reviews of RCTs of acupunc-ture [126-128], in which the no 128],althoughone ofthesesystematicreviewsofRCTsseparatelyexaminedcasereportsofAEsassociatedwithacupunctureandhadfindingscomparable to ours. However, any medical intervention hasthe potential to cause damage, particularly when adminis-tered by an untrained or unqualified practitioner, or in anunregulatedsetting.Ourobjectivewasthustoidentifysignalsthat might suggest the potential for AEs of acupuncture,whenadministeredinspecificsettings,orwhenusingspecificacupuncture styles, and also to compare the patterns of AEsin the past 12 years with the patterns identified in the 35-year period covered by our first review. Comparing the newdata with that of the previous review shows the emergenceof some important new patterns, which may be relevant for futureregulationandpolicymaking. Although the majority of the AEs are still infections, t h er o u t e so fi n f e c t i o nh a v ec h a n g e d .O u rp r e s e n tfi n d i n g sinclude239AEsfrominfection;191occurredinfiveoutbreaksofbacterialinfectioncausedbyskincontactwithunsterilizedequipmentanddirtytowels,inunhygienicclinicalsettings.Inourpreviousfindings,hepatitiscross-infectionsfrompatientto patient due to reused needles (94 cases reported in fouroutbreaks) were the most frequent source of infection. Sincethe introduction of disposable needles, hepatitis infectionshaverarelybeenreported,whichisanimportantachievementthat has resulted from the greater regulation of acupuncturepractice, particularly the requirement in recent years, bacterial infections, including MRSAandmycobacterium,havebecomepervasiveinhealth-caresettingsingeneral[ 129].Suchinfections,apressingcon- cern for all medical practitioners, including acupuncturists,resultfrompoorhygiene.Hygienicclinicalsettings,sterilizedequipment, and clean supplies are critical for preventingfuturesuchinfections. Pneumothoraxisstillthemostcommonorganandtissue injury. There were also cases of spinal cord injuries dueto short, small needles embedded laterally along the spinein the Japanese practice known as okibari.Th ep u t a t i v e mechanism responsible for this AE is that the imbeddedneedles used in the Japanese okibariacupuncture technique c o ul ds po n ta n eo u s l ym i gr a t ewi th i nth eti s s u e ,wi thso m eo fthemmigratingtothespinalcordtocausespinalcordinjury[130]. However, this AE has significantly decreased since our previous review, in which 11 cases due to this practicewere found. In the present review, we found organ injuriesmainly to be associated with faulty needle insertion. Heart i n j u r i e sc a nb ef a t a l ,a l t h o u g hn od e a t hw a sr e p o r t e di nt h efive cases we found. Acupuncture training programs mustenhancestudentknowledgeofanatomyateachacupuncturepoint. Supervised clinical internships must provide rigoroustraininginneedledirection,depthofinsertionwithattentiontothesizeofthepatient,andmethodsofmanipulation. Three cases reported deaths attributed to acupuncture [8,60,89] .T w ow e r ed u et oo r g a ni n j u ri e s[ 60,89], and one tension pneumothorax following acupuncture. Thefinding of the autopsy also suggested the patient that mayhave been injured by the insertion of the needles into thelungs during the previous acupuncture treatments. The sec-ond organ injury death, from Korea, reported that a 68-year-oldwomandiedofmassivehematemesisresultingfromaortoduodenal fistula. The autopsy showed an (3mo) abdominal aorta, caused by a deep insertion with a 15cm long acupuncture needle into the abdomen [ 89]. The third casewasreportedfromScotlandinwhicha69-year-oldmandied from an infection after acupuncture treatment at thethigh [8]. The patient was later found to have a preexisting pancytopenia(i.e.,lowwhitebloodcellcount),resultinginani n c r e a s e ds u s c e p t i b i l i t yt oi n f e c t i o n .Th ec a s er e p o r ta u t h o r ,who is also the practitioner, admitted that the patient's skinattheacupuncturepointwasnotcleanedpriortotheneedleinsertion and later found local muscle infection which ledto septicaemia. The patient died a few weeks later froma multiorgan failure. These three unfortunate death casessuggest that biomedical knowledge such as anatomy andmicrobiology is needed in order avoid organ injury and infection.Skincleansingshouldalsoberequired,particularly forthosepatientswithimmunecompromisedcondition. There were only a handful of cases reported by practi- tionerswhoperformedtheacupuncture[ 8,100,101,103,104, 108]i n c l u d i n gad e a t hr e p o r t[ 8]. The rest of the cases were reported by investigators who were not the acupuncturistswho performed the treatment. Most cases of AEs did notreportthequalificationofthepractitioner.Wewouldsuggestthat future report on AEs of acupuncture should include theinformationonthetrainingqualificationofthepractitionersandtheprocedureusedforthetreatment,suchaswhetherornotcleanneedletechniqueswereused.Acupuncturesafetypracticeguidanceorguidelinessuch as Clean Needle Technique (CNT) appear to have played acriticalroleinminimizingthenumberofAEsassociatedwithacupuncture practice [ 129] .I nt h eU n i t e dS t a t e s ,C N Tw a s firstaddressedbytheNationalCertificationCommissionforAcupuncture and Oriental Medicine in 1984.

In our previous review, about half of the 202 cases ofAE that we identified were from the USA. However, as ourpresent review shows, AE cases reported from the USA arenow rare. Of the 308 cases we found, only 13 were from theU n i t e dS t a t e s ,a n do u to f2 3 9c a s e so fi n f e c t i o n ,o n l y5a r efrom the United States. It should be noted that there werevery few case reports of AEs from China included in thisreview, although acupuncture is widely practiced in China.We are aware that cases of AEs associated with acupuncturep e r f o r m e di nC h i n aa r el i k e l yt ob er e p o r t e di nC h i n e s e12 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine language case reports, which are not reflected in the present reviewduetolanguagelimitation.W earecurrentlypreparingaseparatereviewonAEsreportedinChina. In conclusion, although serious AEs associated with acupuncture are rare, acupuncture practice is not risk-free.Adequateregulationcanevenfurtherminimizeanyrisk.We recommend that not only adequate training in biomedical knowledge, such as anatomy and microbiology, but also safeandcleanpracticeguidelinesarenecessaryrequirementsandshould continue to be enforced in countries such as theUnited States where they exist, and that countries withoutsuchguidelinesshouldconsiderdevelopingtheminordertominimizeacupunctureAEs.

Lai, AND QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION OF A PILOTINTEGRATIVE COPING AND RESILIENCY PROGRAM FOR HEALTHCARE fatigue, and burnout are common maladies among healthcare employees. To address this problem, a holistic integra- tive self-care program for healthcare practitioners was designed,implemented, and evaluated. A total of 84 participants, recruitedvia presentations, flyers, and word of mouth, completed the 8-weekprogram. The experiential course, entitled Healing Pathways, com-bined training in Reiki, guided imagery, yoga, toning, meditation,intuitive scanning, creative expression, and mentorship to fostermore empowered and resilient individuals. We measured the effec-tiveness of the program via mixed methods consisting of qualitativeinterviews providing in-depth feedback and quantitative analysisdemonstrating statistically signicant benet. Participants reportedsignicantly lower levels of stress and signicantly increased condence in their ability to cope at treatment conclusion (8weeks) and long-term follow-up (12 months). These ndingssuggest that an integrative wellness and resiliency program, cou-pled with individual mentorship, may improve coping, decreasestress, and improve functioning and well-being for nurses andother health care providers. Key words: Integrative Medicine, Resiliency, Employee well- ness, Reiki, Yoga, Meditation (Explore 2013; 9:44-47. Published by Elsevier Inc.) INTRODUCTION Maintaining a healthy and robust nursing core is essential for thesuccessful functioning of health care facilities. 1Unfortunately, substantial evidence documents the enormous problem of nurs-ing burnout and its subsequent deleterious effects for nurses andtheir patients. Profound physical and emotional fatigue in on-cology nurses has been documented to result in damaged per-sonal relationships and an increased desire to leave the eld. 2 Similarly, Bailey et al3report that nurses in emergency depart- ments continually struggle with the exhausting emotional effectsof treating dying patients, the recently deceased, and their be-reaved families. In light of mounting research linking practitio-ner burnout with job dissatisfaction, increased employee turn-over, and worse patient outcomes, it has become a priority forhospitals and medical centers to improve employee morale andjob satisfaction. 4 Recognizing that no single program can tackle the myriad factors contributing to employee burnout, researchers havechosen instead to focus on the promotion of improved cop-ing and resiliency. In their research, Cohen-Katz et al 5used mixed methods evaluation, consisting of both quantitativeand qualitative analyses, to demonstrate the effectiveness ofmindfulness-based stress reduction 6in decreasing exhaus-tion, increasing mindfulness, and improving relationships in the lives of participating nurses. Another self-care program,implemented by Brathovde, 7taught nurses and other health- care providers Reiki, which is \"a simple, therapeutic self-caremodality\" that is thought to assist in balancing the user'senergy eld and thereby facilitating healing and relaxation.Participants reported greater levels of caring, both for them-selves and for others, and an increased desire for further ed-ucation and training in holistic approaches. Other programs have integrated multiple techniques into a comprehensive resiliency curriculum designed to combat theeffects of stress, fatigue, and burnout. For example, Raingruberand Robinson 8report on a self-care program that includes yoga, tai chi, meditation, and Reiki. The researchers used a qualitativeevaluation approach and found that participants reported in-creased sensations of calm, improved problem-solving ability,and a better ability to focus on patients needs. The Center for Integrative Medicine's faculty and staff sought to capitalize on lessons learned via previous research in thedevelopment of a holistic healing program for nurses and healthcare providers to be implemented at the R Adams Cowley ShockTrauma Center at the University of Maryland Medical Center.The resulting program, entitled Healing Pathways, initially was not developed as a research protocol, but rather, as a pilot staffresiliency program. However, the perceived success of the pro-gram prompted program staff to contact the University of Mary-land Institutional Review Board to seek approval to move be-yond quality assurance follow-up and toward a more systematicqualitative and quantitative evaluation. Thus, upon approval from the University of Maryland Institutional Review Board, weused both qualitative and quantitative analytical methods toevaluate this integrative resiliency program designed to enhance 1 Center for Integrative Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD2 R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center at The University of Mary-land Medical Center, Baltimore, MD #Corresponding Author.

METHODS ParticipantsIndividuals were recruited into the Healing Pathways programvia multiple means. Initially, the program was introducedthrough a series of presentations to the R Adams Cowley ShockTrauma Center administration, the University of MarylandMedical Center administration, and at nursing Grand Rounds.Further interest in the program was generated from postings onthe Center for Integrative Medicine and the University of Mary-land Medical Center Web sites. In addition, e-mails were sent tostaff distribution lists, advertisement flyers were posted on nurs-ing units, and presentations were delivered at staff in-servicemeetings. Six cohorts of health care professionals, totaling 82 partici- pants, completed the Healing Pathways program between 2008and 2011. More than 90% of the participants were either nursesor nurse practitioners, with the remaining group composed ofmassage therapists, social workers, and physical therapists. Measures Healing Pathways participants completed two self-report ques-tionnaires at three time points: (pretreatment), 8 weeks(treatment conclusion), and 12-month follow-up. Measures werechosen with respect to their expected relationship to the impactof the program. The rst measure, the Perceived Stress Scale(PSS), is a 10-item Likert-type scale assessing the degree to whichthe respondent feels that life is manageable and that he or shecan cope with life stressors. The Coping Self-Efcacy Scale, alsoa Likert-type measure, is a 26-item self-report assessment thatevaluates the extent to which respondents feel condent in theirability to manage and respond to adverse events. 9,10 Because the PSS is a state measure, reflecting changes in stress appraisals over time, the authors of the scale expected that \"test-retest correlations should be much higher for short retest inter-vals than for longer ones.\" During the PSS validation atest-retest correlation of 0.85 was found when subjects' assess-ment was separated by 2 days. When assessment was extended to6 weeks however, the same correlation was found to be 0.55.Similarly, in testing the Coping Self-Efcacy Scale, the authorsfound that test-retest reliability was greater in the short term, at3 and 6 months, and somewhat lower at 12 months, with corre-lation coefcients ranging from 0.40 to 0.80. For the follow-up qualitative assessment conducted with pro- gram participants, program staff developed a 12-item question-naire designed to assess the impact of the program in the indi-vidual's work and personal life (Appendix 1). Using participantanswers to these questions, the authors crafted three vignettesrepresentative of the experience of Healing Pathways graduates. The Intervention The program was designed to enhance one's coping ability; sup-port growth, healing, and empowerment; and to rejuvenate thespirit of the participating professional. A driving force behindthe program was the desire to train participants in self-care skills,to enable them to better know themselves, and their limits,thereby improving their ability to care for their patients. Partic-ipants were taught multiple techniques that could be integratedand used for self-healing, including: Reiki training (levels 1 and2), prana yoga, musical toning for relaxation, meditation, guidedimagery, intuitive body scanning, and creative expression. Thethread weaving together these seemingly distinct healing tech-niques was their ability to aid in healing, relaxing, and balancingthe participant. Each cohort participated in an 8-week program consisting of six 3-hour training sessions covering all of the aforementionedintegrative techniques except Reiki, which was taught in twoseparate full day trainings totaling 10 hours. Finally, upon pro-gram completion, participants received three additional hours ofindividual mentoring to assist in incorporating their new skillsinto their personal and professional lives. The challenge of tran-sitioning the use of meditation and Reiki from a wellness center,to the midst of stressful work environments, prompted the in-clusion of the follow-up supportive mentoring sessions. QUANTITATIVE RESULTS Analysis of variance showed that mean levels of stress, as mea-sured by the PSS, decreased signicantly between baseline andthe end of 8 weeks of treatment ( Figure 1). Mean stress was still signicantly below baseline levels at the 12-month follow-up.Levels of coping self-efcacy increased signicantly during thesame time period, with the effect also remaining signicant atthe 12-month follow up (Figure 2). QUALITATIVE RESULTS The following vignettes were culled from answers provided bythree program participants who responded to the 12-item followup questionnaire (Appendix 1). Response A I originally signed up for Healing Pathways to help me tap into a source that could replenish my own energy stores so that I may 16.9 11.714.4 05101520Mean Perceived Stress Time (In Weeks)Baseline 8-Week * 12 Month Follow Up * Figure 1.

I had to learn to let things go, and I ammore open to receiving. I'm able to leave work behind for the most part. As I enter the highway tunnel, I leave my stress at the entranceand come out with a new sense of peace and calm that I can bringhome. I feel like a more complete person where things line up easilyand I am more grounded and centered. I have learned to say \"no\"and discard unhealthy relationships and know that if one ends thatit is just the time for it to end. Response B I went into the program with an open mind. I had never been a bigmeditator, wasn't crazy about journaling, wanted to try yoga, andwas curious about Reiki. I had been trained in Reiki in the 1990sand felt that the training hadn't really taken. I now realize, that asa nurse, I can't x everyone; sometimes others are not ready to behealed, all I can do is plant a seed for healing and let go. I amlearning to let others do more for me instead of trying to do it all. Ilearned to say \"no\" and not feel guilty. I have also learned to releaseold thoughts and feelings, allowing for me to open up to others andweed out some of the toxic people in my life. I do yoga at least oncea week, and on most days I spend 20 minutes in meditation, doReiki, and get outside in nature. Response C I joined Healing Pathways to obtain knowledge, lower my stresslevel, and to learn how to take time for myself. Reiki is by far themost helpful skill I gained, I use it to cope while at work andwhenever I feel stress. I now have the tools to manage difcultiesand am more tolerant of my own limitations. I am denitely able toset and maintain boundaries and I have become more spiritual. Asan abused child, I was bitter and angry for years. I wanted to knowwhy those things were done to me and why my mother did notprotect me. I will never be able to forget what was done but I haveforgiven. I have become more compassionate, accepting others asthey work through their issues. I now know that health is well-beingin all aspects of the self: body, mind, and spirit. DISCUSSION The Healing Pathways program demonstrated both statisticalefcacy and subjective benet for the current sample of healthcare practitioners. Such results suggest that an integrative and holistic self-care program, offered to health care professionals,might be a feasible approach to addressing the problems associ-ated with employee burn out. These initial ndings suggest thatsuch a program can be expected to lower self-reported levels ofstress while simultaneously increasing one's perceived ability tocope with life's challenges. There were several limitations to this study. Because the proj- ect was initially developed as a pilot training program, and not aresearch study, limited effort was directed towards generalizabil-ity and internal validity. There was likely some selection bias inthis study because participants were self-selected. Participants inthis program were likely more interested in the proposed trainingmodalities than the typical healthcare worker and were in somecases associates of program staff. Potential sampling bias is fur-ther complicated by the fact that participants were administeredassessments by staff who also were directly involved in the pro-gram trainings. Consequently, future research should employ arandomized and controlled design which uses research assistantsto handle data collection and additional valid measures to buttressthe current ndings. In addition, further research is needed to ex-plore the mechanisms of action for each particular healingtechnique and to determine whether comprehensive integra- tive programs such as Healing Pathways are more effectivethan single-modality interventions. Furthermore, although the contin-ued study of coping and resiliency programs is likely to improve theefcacy of such endeavors, a question of equal importance is whether such programs should be offered earlier in the healthcare training curriculum as a preventive health promotion tool. Finally, no precise assessment of the ongoing use of acquired skills was conducted at follow-up. However, Healing Pathways staffreport change in numerous participants as evidenced by their con-sistent presence in additional programmatic offerings such as yogaclasses, advanced Reiki trainings, as well as meditation and sharingopportunities. Further investigations of Healing Pathways and sim-ilar integrative programs would benet from a systematic follow-upassessment of the frequency of new skill usage, the perceived valueof the skills, and whether skills were being used in isolation or in anintegrated fashion as they were taught. Despite these potential limitations, the present ndings suggest that a relatively small number of healers and trainers could theoret-ically have signicant impact on the morale, resiliency, and reten-tion of an essential corps of employees. Given the continued strug-gle to contain healthcare costs and the established link betweenpatient outcomes and the level of practitioner stress, Healing Path-ways and similar programs warrant further research. Although thetwo self-reported measures lend statistical credence to the perceivedsuccess of the program, it is indeed the qualitative vignettes thathave been the most memorable and compelling element of ourprogrammatic experience. Such qualitative results underscore theprofound impact that such programs can have on the individualand are emblematic of the empowered individual that was the goalof the Healing Pathways program.

The increasing burden of chronic diseases presents not only challenges to the knowledge and expertise of the professional medical community, but also highlights the need to improve the quality and relevance of clinical research in this domain. Many patientsnow turn to complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) to treat their chronic illnesses; however, there is very little evidence to guide their decision-making in usual care. The following research recommendations were derived from a CIM Stakeholder S y m p o s i u mo nC o m p a r a t i v eE ectiveness Research (CER): (1) CER studies should be made a priority in this eld; (2) stakeholders should be engaged at every stage of the research; (3) CER study designs should highlight e ectiveness over e cacy; (4) research questions should be well dened to enable the selection of an appropriate CER study design; (5) the CIM community should cultivate widely shared understandings, discourse, tools, and technologies to support the use and validity of CER methods; (6)Eectiveness Guidance Documents on methodological standards should be developed to shape future CER studies. CER is an emerging eld and its development and impact must be reflected in future research strategies within CIM. This stakeholder symposium was a rst step in providing systematic guidance for future CER in this eld. 1. Introduction The increasing burden of chronic diseases presents challenges not only to the knowledge and expertise of the professional medical community, but also to the socioeconomic stability of society. Chronic disease\u2014which includes chronic pain,diabetes, and heart disease, among others\u2014represents 75%of health care spending in the USA; patients with ve or morechronic diseases account for 76% of Medicare spending [ 1].Increasingly, treating patients' chronic illnesses requires complex interventions made up of various interconnectingparts [ 2]. Especially in a combination of interventions and the possible interactions between them, a more personalizedtreatment plan is called for. Complementary and integrativemedicine is among the options that can be tailored for morepersonalized/individualized medicine. The National Center for Complementary and Alter- native Medicine (NCCAM) denes complementary and2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine alternative medicine as \"a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices and products that are notpresently considered to be a part of conventional medicine.Complementary medicine is used together with conventionalmedicine, and alternative medicine is used in place ofconventional medicine\" [ 3]. Its integration into health care has shifted more and more to an \"integrative medicine\" approach which was dened by the Consortium of AcademicHealth Centers for Integrative Medicine as \"the practice ofmedicine that rea rms the importance of the relationship between practitioner and patient, focuses on the wholeperson, is informed by evidence, and makes use of allappropriate therapeutic approaches, healthcare professionalsand disciplines to achieve optimal health and healing\" [ 4]. In the USA, many patients now turn to interventions in complementary and integrative medicine to treat theirillnesses. High usage of complementary and integrativemedicine interventions, especially for patients su ering from chronic diseases, has been reported [ 5]. In 2007, nearly 4 out of 10 American adults had used a complementary andintegrative medicine therapy in the previous 12 months [ 6]. As treatments become more complex (taking into ac- count a patient's local context, subgroup membership, co-morbidities, or other factors), the design of research assessingeectiveness requires flexibility in order to accommodate these various factors. Unfortunately, many complementary and integrative medicine interventions lack the endorsement that evolvesfrom high quality research studies; indeed, much of theevidence that supports their adoption has not made the transition from the expert level into accessible, widespread knowledge. Clearly, stakeholders (physicians, patients, pay-ers, and others) need access to this evidence to make deci-sions about their treatment options. Nevertheless, research studies in complementary and integrative medicine are on the rise. In the USA, the NationalCenter for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at theNational Institutes of Health and other funding agenciesand foundations have supported clinical, translational, andbasic research on the e cacy, safety, and mechanisms of action of diverse complementary and alternative medicinemodalities. However, to date, the majority of clinical trialshave assessed the e cacy of medical interventions rather than their e ectiveness. \"Ecacy\" refers to the extent to which a specic inter- vention is benecial under ideal conditions. By contrast,\"eectiveness\" is a measure of the extent to which an inter- vention, when deployed in the eld in routine circum-stances, does what it is intended to do for a specicpopulation [ 7]. Therefore, e ectiveness can often be more relevant to policy evaluation and the health care decisionsof providers and patients. Unfortunately, some e orts to achieve rigorous methodological purity have resulted inclinical results that are only marginally meaningful, because patients, interventions, and settings are not comparable to the real world. This burden presents the research communitywith a mandate: to discover not only e cacious treatments, but also interventions that provide the evidence critical fordecisions relevant to the treatment of usual care patients.Drug research follows a clear hierarchical research strat- egy that establishes e cacy before e ectiveness is evaluated. Because of its long history, complementary medicine treat-ments are often in widespread use before clinical researchhas been conducted. For complementary and integrativemedicine, a reverse research strategy was recommended [ 8, 9]. Using a strategy that generates evidence on comparative eectiveness before determining component e cacy will help to focus on treatments that have relevance for practiceand a potential for integration into health care while savingresearch resources. Because studies in Comparative E ectiveness Research (CER) are designed to be carried out in settings that reflectusual care, they have considerable potential to help healthcare providers as well as patients and clinicians to chooseamong currently available therapeutic options in comple-mentary and integrative medicine. The Institute of Medicinedenes CER as \"the generation and synthesis of evidence thatcompares the benets and harms of alternative methods toprevent, diagnose, treat, and monitor a clinical condition orto improve the delivery of care. The purpose of CER is toassist consumers, clinicians, purchasers, and policy makersto make informed decisions that will improve health care atboth the individual and population levels\" [ 10]. (\" Alterna- tive\" does not refer to \"alternative medicine\" but to \"bestcare\" options.) Among other challenges confronting the US health care system is a paucity of information about CER [ 11]. The current movement in conventional medicine towards moreCER places strong emphasis on the evaluation of di erent treatment options by including more heterogeneous patients and by using less standardized treatment protocols andmore patient-centered outcomes. Furthermore, stakeholderinvolvement is seen as highly relevant [ 12]. Having patients, doctors, health plan managers, hospital executives, and otherstakeholders participate in the design of CER can ensure thatthis vital research focuses on the evidence gaps most relevantto health care decision makers [ 13]. CER o ers a wide range of research designs and advanced techniques to distill and condense evidence from di erent t y p e so fs t u d i e s[ 14] and is not limited to randomized trials but includes, among other options, the possibility of usingdata from observational studies or registries. Additionally,the concept of pragmatic clinical trials has emerged todescribe those randomized trials that are designed explicitlyto meet the needs of clinical and health policy decision-making and gain increasing acceptance by decision-makers. Because of the increasing and widespread use of interven- tions such as acupuncture, mindfulness-based interventions(yoga, meditation, etc.), and nutritional supplements tomanage a variety of chronic disorders (chronic pain, cardio-vascular disorders, etc.), and because there is a signicantlack of evidence that supports decision-making regardingthese interventions, the Institute of Medicine has identied them among its priorities for CER in complementary and integrative medicine [ 10]. The aim of this project was to provide recommendations for a strategic framework for CER in the eld of complemen-tary and integrative medicine.Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3 2. Methods In 2009, The Institute of Integrative Health (TIIH) and the Center for Medical T echnology Policy (CMTP) cosponsoreda Complementary and Integrative Medicine StakeholderSymposium on CER. Symposium participants, includingclinicians, patient advocates, payers (health insurance com-panies), and researchers (clinical researchers and methodol-ogists), were selected to represent a broad range of stakehold-ers in the eld of complementary and integrative medicine.The meeting was structured to focus attention on fourcentral topics: (1) current evidence gaps in complementaryand integrative medicine; (2) optimal study designs; (3) uti-lization innovations from conventional medicine forcomplementary and integrative medicine; and (4) preferredoutcomes to better inform decision-making. Experts wereinvited to give introductory presentations to the discussants.Meeting participants provided helpful presentations to focusconversation and drive discussion. From the summary of the meeting, the following recom- mendations for future clinical research on complementaryand integrative medicine were developed and sent back toall meeting participants for comments [ 15]. Comments were included and the nal version of the recommendations was approved by the workshop participants. 3. Recommendations The following recommendations for future research in complementary and integrative medicine were developed: (1) Because Gaps in Evidence for Clinical and Health Policy Decision-Making Are Signicant, CER Studies Should BeMade a Priority. There is widespread and increasing use of complementary and integrative medicine, often in addi-tion to conventional health care. Only scant evidence oncomparative e ectiveness of di erent treatment options is available and there are few data on the e ectiveness of complex interventions. Because of this signicant lack of datato support clinical and health policy decision-making, CERstudies are urgently needed. (2) CER Should Engage Stakeholders at Every Stage of Research. Stakeholders have a vested interest in the outcomes associated with CER studies in complementary and inte-grative medicine. Patients, payers, and clinicians and other relevant stakeholders should be involved in every aspect of the research including identifying research priorities,study design, interpretation of results, and implementation.A mechanism is needed, through which decision-makersmay communicate their needs, and that might also solicitstakeholder input for the design and implementation of CERstudies. Patient input, in particular, can work to ensure thatstudies are likely to generate patient-relevant results. (3) CER Study Designs Should Highlight E ectiveness over Ecacy to Support Clinical and Health Policy Decision- Making. Designs that emphasize e ectiveness over e cacycan reshape outcomes that will be of most value to stake- holders who are faced with decision-making in usual caresituations. Such studies must (1) broaden the heterogeneity of study participants; (2) report results of subgroups in studypopulations even if they are exploratory; (3) ensure that research settings\u2014including the treatment protocol\u2014reflect usual care; (4) and also reflect usual practitioner-patientinteractions. (4) Well-Dened Research Questions Are Prerequisites for Selecting Appropriate CER Study Designs. Stakeholders in the eld of complementary and integrative medicine embracea vision of medicine and human health as products, pro-cedures, pathologies, and policies enmeshed in a complexand interdependent holistic system. Consequently, the eld'sresearch questions\u2014and its need for evidence to informdecision-making\u2014insist that the methods used must beappropriate to answer these research questions. Althoughmany methods are well established in CER, these methodsmust not determine research questions, but rather, researchquestions must determine methods. A variety of study designs should be considered before deciding which is best suited for addressing the relevantresearch questions. The methodological advantages (anddisadvantages) of (1) pragmatic clinical trials; (2) clusterrandomized trials; (3) Bayesian and adaptive approaches; (4) registries and observational studies (ideally PBRN-based); and (5) other variants of design should be explored. (5) The Complementary and Integrative Medicine Community Should Cultivate Widely Shared Understandings, Discourse,Tools, and Technologies to Support the Use and Validity ofCER Methods. Generating support for the use and validity of methods other than RCTs requires that the complementaryand integrative medicine community continue to work withothers in the CER community to explore new study designs,communicate results, explore decision-making, examine evi-dence hierarchies, continuously share information, and eval-uate its progress in meeting the goal of addressing evidentiarygaps. The responsibility for disseminating information aboutCER in complementary and integrative medicine should beshared among stakeholders. (6) E ectiveness Guidance Documents (EGDs) Should Be Developed to Shape Future CER Studies. Driven by the infor- mation and decision-making needs of patients, payers, and clinicians and other relevant stakeholders, clear descriptionof the details of the design of CER studies for di erent complementary and integrative medicine modalities is crit-ical. In order to provide useful methodological guidancefor researchers, EGDs should be developed to address suchelements of study design as patient inclusion, comparators,settings, outcomes, and/or other elements. Importantly,EGDs can be strategically conceptualized to address specicclinical conditions and utilize stakeholder input to ensurethat future results are applicable to real-world situations.Because CER is continuously developing, EGDs should beupdated accordingly.4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 4. Discussion These recommendations derived from a group represent- ing di erent stakeholders o er many potential benets. Among them are the development of research questionsclearly linked to outcomes and relevant evidence for clinicaldecision-making. The development of appropriate method-ological standards and guidance documents to interfacewith CER is associated with the framework for complexinterventions [ 16]. Recent methodological development by the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI)and the framework for complex interventions from UK canprovide thorough guidance [ 17]. These recommendations were derived from a stepwise development process, and the active involvement of di erent stakeholders (clinicians, patients, payers, and researchers) ensures broader acceptability. Although a consensus procedure was used to develop these recommendations, stakeholder participation was stilllimited to the group of participants. The use of more widelydisseminated survey tools to increase and diversify stake-holder input could be leveraged in the future. Furthermore, opinions in these recommendations derive largely from USA-based Western perspectives and traditions. Broaderparticipation should be solicited from more internationalexperts, including non-Western experts and stakeholders. During the development process, a broader understand- ing of the unique methodological aspects of CER and itsapplicability to complementary and integrative medicineemerged. CER studies are intended to improve the externalvalidity of clinical research to enable decision-makers tomake informed decisions. Nevertheless, moving towardshigher external validity simultaneously reduces the internalvalidity of study results. In a clinical trial, the balancebetween internal and external validity is not a scienticdecision, but has to be carefully negotiated with the relevantstakeholder groups. Although the recommended reverseresearch strategy [ 8,9] reflects the context and needs of complementary and integrative medicine, there is a needto discuss how contrary results on e ectiveness and its components could be transferred into clinical and healthpolicy decision-making. While the phenomenon of stakeholder involvement seems largely limited to CER studies in the United States atpresent, stakeholder participation remains a high priority.In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has pursued a longstanding agenda prior- itizing community engagement [ 18]. Sox (2010), reporting on the progress of CER in the US, suggested that \" ...all stakeholders are invited to play an active role in everyaspect of CER, including priority setting, study design,and peer review\" [ 19]. Many stakeholders have a vested interest in these recommendations. In that CER is nowwidely discussed in the complementary and integrativemedicine community, the recommendations encourage thedevelopment of shared understandings about the termi-nology, methodological approaches, ethical concerns, stake-holder engagement strategies, researcher training, and thedissemination of CER research and discussion. CER is anew area for complementary and integrative medicine as it is for conventional medicine. Although, in selected areassuch as acupuncture research, some contributions to CERhave already been made, clear guidance is needed for futureresearch. The recommendations provided in this paper support the development of E ectiveness Guidance Documents (EGDs) [ 20]. EGDs provide detailed guidance for researchers who will pursue CER in the future. EGDs can focus on aclinical condition (e.g., osteoarthritis) or a category of clini-cal intervention (e.g., acupuncture) or both (acupuncture forosteoarthritis). Because the quality and breadth of availableevidence varies from topic to topic, each EGD is specicand may recommend variations in study designs, which willgenerate the type and quality of evidence stakeholders needto support decision-making. 5. Conclusion CER is an emerging eld and its development and impacthave to be reflected in future research strategy withincomplementary and integrative medicine. This stakeholdersymposium was a rst step in providing systematic guidancefor future CER in this eld. More detailed guidance mustfollow.

Vitamin E and the carotenoids are two classes of dietary antioxidants with profound anti-in flammatory effects, and the goal of this study was to assess whether higher post-fracture concentrations of these antioxidants were associated with lower levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and the soluble receptor for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (sTNF- aR1), two common markers of in flammation. Methods: Serum concentrations of the dietary antioxidants and in flammatory markers were assessed at baseline and 2, 6, and 12 month follow-up visits among 148 hip fracture patients from The Baltimore HipStudies. Generalized estimating equations modeled the relationship between baseline and time-varyingantioxidant concentrations and in flammatory markers. Results: Higher post-fracture concentrations of vitamin E and the carotenoids were associated with lower levels of in flammatory markers. Associations were strongest at baseline, particularly between the a- tocopherol form of vitamin E and sTNF- aR1 (p\u00bc0.05) concentrations were also associated with sTNF- aR1 at all post-fracture visits (p /C200.05). Conclusions: These ndings suggest that a clinical trial increasing post-fracture intake of vitamin E and the carotenoids may be warranted. /C2112012 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Introduction Chronic in flammation is thought to play a role in an increasing number of adverse health outcomes.1,2Approximately 1.6 million people suffer from hip fracture annually,3and older adults recovering from hip fracture have particularly high levels of inflammatory markers that persist an entire year after the injury.4 While the mechanism is currently unclear and the cause likelymulti-factorial, this in flammation may be a result of the excessiveoxidative stress shown to occur after bone fractures 5and bone- corrective surgical procedures.6The typical hip fracture patient is functionally compromised for greater than a year after the injury7 and those with higher peak and persistent levels of in flammation experience worse recovery.4Thus, while acute in flammation is a necessary part of the healing process, persistent in flammation appears to hamper post-fracture functional recovery and reducing this chronic in flammatory response might be an effective strategy to expedite and improve recovery from hip fracture. Antioxidants may help lessen this persistent in flammatory response by reducing the high levels of oxidative stress after hipfracture. Oxidative stress is a result of oxygen metabolism and therefore a certain degree is necessary for life. However, excessive oxidative stress incurs substantial cellular damage and can elicit an inflammatory response. 8Antioxidants are substances that reduce oxidative stress and are either produced endogenously or obtainedAbbreviations: IL-6, beta; BHS4, HPLC, Reverse-phase high-pressure http://www.elsevier.com /locate/clnu 0261-5614/$ esee front matter /C2112012 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Vitamin E and the carotenoids, two of the most biologically active classes of dietary antioxidants, have been associ- ated with reduced risk of chronic disease9and have demonstrated potent anti-in flammatory effects.10,11Recent research among hip fracture patients speci cally has shown that higher concentrations of vitamin E were associated with better post-fracture physical func-tion. 12The mechanism for this protective relationship is currently unknown, but antioxidant-mediated reduction of the in flammatory cytokines that have been strongly associated with loss of the muscle tissue13critical to physical function is one plausible explanation. The goal of this study was to determine whether higher serum concentrations of vitamin E and the carotenoids at baseline and throughout the year after hip fracture were associated with lower levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and the soluble receptor for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (sTNF- aR1), two common markers of inflammation. IL-6 and TNF- aappear to be of clinical importance in hip fracture recovery as concentrations of these in flammatory markers have been associated with poor recovery and are persis-tently high after fracture. 4We hypothesized that higher concen- trations of vitamin E and the carotenoids both at baseline andthroughout the year after hip fracture would be associated withlower levels of these important in flammatory biomarkers. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Subjects The study participants were drawn from the fourth cohort of The Baltimore Hip Studies (BHS4), a randomized clinical trial designed to assess the effects of an exercise intervention in reducing bone and muscle loss after hip fracture. 14The study enrolled 180 community- dwelling women /C2165 years of age who were admitted to one of three hospitals in Baltimore with surgical repair of a non- pathological hip fracture. Due to the physical and cognitive demands involved in an exercise program, participants were also required to have been able to walk without human assistance before the fracture and have scored /C2120 on the Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination15(MMSE). Participants were excluded on the basis of medical conditions that are contraindicated with exercise including; cardiovascular disease, respiratory problems, neuro- muscular conditions, bone diseases, metastatic cancer, cirrhosis, end-stage renal disease, and other conditions that increase the risk of falls during exercise (seizures or substance abuse/dependency) or increase the risk of injury after a fall (Coumadin use or gastroin- testinal bleeding). Only 19% of screened participants were deemed eligible for the study based upon these stringent selection criteria, resulting in a study population of hip fracture patients with a rela- tively high degree of health and function. Assessments consisting of an interview, functional measurements, dual energy X-ray absorp- tiometry (DXA), and a blood draw were conducted by research nurses at baseline (within 15 days after the hip fracture injury [mean 10.9 days after fracture] and following corrective surgery in all participants) and 2, 6 and 12 months post-fracture. Thenal sample for this analysis consisted of the 148 unique BHS4 participants from whom a blood sample was successfully drawn at /C211 study visit. Out of the 148 unique participants in this study, 40 had serum antioxidant data at all 4 visits, 59 had data at 3 visits, 36 had data at 2 visits, and 13 had data for 1 visit. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of Maryland and each study hospital. 2.2. Serum antioxidant and in flammatory marker assessment Blood samples were obtained by venipuncture and processed following a standardized protocol. Serum samples were storedcontinuously at /C070/C14C until the time of analysis for two of the major forms of vitamin E ( a-tocopherol and g-tocopherol), markers (IL-6 and sTNF- aR1) under study, all of which are stable under these long-term storage conditions.16Serum antioxidant concentrations were measured by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and serum in flammatory marker concentrations were analyzed using commercially available kits(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). All serum antioxidant and inflammatory marker assays were conducted at The Johns Hopkins University. The inter-assay and intra-assay coef cients of variation, respectively, were as follows; vitamin E /C011.4% and 7.8% for a- tocopherol and 2.98% and 5.47% for sTNF- aR1. 2.3. Statistical analysis Descriptive analyses were conducted to characterize the study population and describe the distributions of the antioxidant andinflammatory biomarker concentrations during the year after hip fracture. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) 17were used to deter- mine the associations between baseline antioxidant concentrationsand in flammatory biomarkers at baseline and throughout the year after hip fracture (2, 6, and 12 month post-fracture visits) whileadjusting for covariates and accounting for within epatient corre- lation. These analyses only used data from participants who hadserum antioxidant data at baseline ( n\u00bc96). In addition to the baseline analysis, a time-varying analysis assessing the relationship between antioxidant concentrations at each of the four post-fracture study visits and the in flammatory markers throughout the year after fracture was also conducted.Marginal structural models (MSM) 18were constructed in the time- varying analyses to account for potential time-dependent con-founding of the relationship between the dietary antioxidant concentrations and in flammatory markers by body-fat percentage and physical activity level. Each MSM was t using a weighted GEE, where the weight was the estimated inverse probability density of the antioxidant concentration. Weights were estimated by linearly regressing antioxidant concentrations on the covariates described below. The probability densities of the observed antioxidants were then calculated assuming the antioxidants follow a normal proba- bility density with the tted antioxidant values and mean squared error from the linear regression as the mean and variance,respectively. The weights were then applied to the GEE models, which contained the antioxidant concentrations, time since frac- ture, and time-by-antioxidant interaction terms. These analyses used data from participants who had antioxidants measured during at least one study visit ( n\u00bc148). The relationships between the eight individual dietary antioxi- dants under study and the in flammatory biomarkers were assessed in separate regression models. Regression models were also used to determine the relationship between \"Total Carotenoids \", consisting of the sum of the six forms of carotenoids that are most abundant inthe body and commonly analyzed together, 19and the in flammatory markers. A number of potential confounders of the relationship between antioxidants and in flammatory biomarkers were assessed. Cova- riates included in the baseline analyses were baseline age, comorbidity (Charlson Comorbidity Index20), cognitiveC.R. D 'Adamo (2012) 659 e665 660Author's personal copy function (MMSE), urinary tract infection, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living21(IADLS), and study group allocation (exercise group vs. control group). Covariates included in the time-varying regres- sion analyses were the baseline covariates as well as body-fat percentage (using DXA), urinary tract infection, physical activity (using total activity time in the Yale Physical Activity Scale22), and IADLS throughout the year after hip fracture. Each of the time-varying covariates were assessed at the 2, 6, and 12 month post- fracture follow-up visits. A number of acute medical complica- tions are known to occur during the year after hip fracture 23that could potentially confound the relationship between antioxidantmicronutrients and in flammatory biomarkers. Therefore, a wide variety of complications that were assessed in BHS4 includingcongestive heart failure, cardiac arrest, renal failure, bone fracture, pressure ulcers, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and wound infections were considered as potential covariates in regression models. However, urinary tract infection was the only complication that arose in at least one participant at each study visit in this relatively healthy cohort of hip fracture patients. Consequently, incidence of urinary tract infection was the only one of these complications that was included as a covariate in regressionmodels. Associations were considered statistically signi cant when p<0.05. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). 3. Results Table 1 characterizes the study population at each visit. The study sample was composed of 148 unique female hip fracture patients with a mean age of 82.0 (standard deviation [SD] \u00bc7.0) years, Charlson Comorbidity Index of 1.1 (SD \u00bc1.3) points, and body-fat percentage of 33.5 (SD \u00bc9.2) at baseline which increased slightly throughout the year after fracture. Post-fracture physicalactivity increased from 2 months to 6 months, but decreased slightly from 6 months to 12 months. Disability, as expressed by Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs), increased after hip fracture and decreased at each subsequent visit during the year after hip fracture. There were very few complications in this robust cohort of hip fracture patients with the exception of urinary tract infections, which decreased throughout the year after fracture(from 4.0% at baseline to 0.7% at 12 months). Antioxidant concen-trations were lowest and in flammatory biomarkers were highest at baseline. Though there were differences between the individualforms, the greatest increases in vitamin E and carotenoids concentrations generally occurred between baseline and 2 months. The greatest decreases in IL-6 and sTNF- aR1 also occurred between baseline and 2 months, though these in flammatory biomarkers continued to decrease throughout the year after fracture. Tables 2 e5summarize the results of the covariate-adjusted regression models assessing the relationships between the anti- oxidants and in flammatory markers after hip fracture. Table 2 reveals that higher baseline a-tocopherol was associated with lower sTNF- aR1 at baseline (beta \u00bc/C019.6, p\u00bc0.05) but at no other post-fracture visits. Time-varying a-tocopherol was also associated with lower sTNF- aR1 at baseline (beta \u00bc/C018.7, p\u00bc0.05) but at no other post-fracture visits. The g-tocopherol form of vitamin E was not signi cantly associated with sTNF- aR1 at any point during the year after fracture. Table 3 shows that neither form of vitamin E was signi cantly associated with IL-6 at any point during the year after hip fracture. Table 4 reveals that higher baseline total carotenoids were associated with lower sTNF- aR1 at baseline (beta \u00bc/C0513, p\u00bc0.01) but at no other post-fracture visits. All of the individual baselinecarotenoids were signi cantly associated with lower baseline sTNF- exception of baseline lycopene ( Baseline a-carotene was also associated with lower sTNF- aR1 at all study visits p\u00bc0.05) also associated lower sTNF- aR1 at 2 and 6 months post-fracture, respectively, but most of the indi-vidual baseline carotenoids were not associated with sTNF- aR1 at the 2, 6, or 12 month post-fracture visits. Time-varying totalcarotenoids were also associated with lower sTNF- aR1 at baseline (beta\u00bc/C0454, p\u00bc0.008) but at no other post-fracture visits. All individual time-varying carotenoids lycopene ( p\u00bc0.01). Unlike baseline individual carotenoids, most of the time-varying individual carotenoids were signi cantly associated with lower sTNF- aR1 at 2, 6, or 12 month post-fracture visits. In particular, higher concentrations of time-varying a-caro- tene lutein were signi cantly associated sTNF- aR1 Table 1 Participant Characteristics.

Discussion Higher serum concentrations of vitamin E and the carotenoids were associated with lower concentrations of in flammatory markers in this cohort of hip fracture patients. However, the strength of association varied substantially by both the class of antioxidant and the in flammatory marker. While serum concen- trations of both classes of these dietary antioxidants were associatedwith less in flammation, the carotenoids generally demonstrated stronger relationships than vitamin E with both sTNF- aR1 and IL-6. The reason for this discrepancy is unknown, but the fact that the half-lives of the serum carotenoids (between 26 and 76 days24)a r e much longer than those of vitamin E (13 h for g-tocopherol and 57 h fora-tocopherol25) suggests that carotenoids might potentially provide more sustained anti-in flammatory activity than vitamin E due to their extended period of systemic circulation. In addition, the strength of associations with in flammatory markers varied substantially across the individual micronutrientswithin each class of dietary antioxidants. For instance, the a-tocopherol form of vitamin E was much more strongly associatedwith sTNF- aR1 than the g-tocopherol form. While the evidence in humans is fairly limited at present, this nding was somewhat surprising as g-tocopherol has been shown to possess stronger anti-in flammatory effects than a-tocopherol in animal carotenoids, serum a-carotene, lutein, and zeaxanthin were the most strongly and consistently associated with lower concentrations of in flammatory markers. In particular, higher concentrations of both baseline and time-varying a-caro- tene were strongly associated with lower concentrations of sTNF- aR1 at every study visit. These ndings suggest that a-carotene, an important micronutrient that has received relatively little attentioncompared to the other dietary carotenoids, may be warrant future study among hip fracture patients. Lutein and zeaxanthin often accompany one another in leafy green vegetables and other dietary sources, but the reason that these particular carotenoids and a- carotene were more strongly related to lower in flammatory markers than the other dietary antioxidants under study is unclear and worthy of further study. Thendings of this study may have important implications to the growing number of older adults suffering from hip fracture, in whom persistent in flammation has been associated with poor recovery.4There are several plausible explanations for the associ- ations between these common dietary antioxidants and in flam- matory markers. While the relationships between the particularantioxidant micronutrients and in flammatory markers in this analysis have not previously been studied after hip fracture or anytraumatic injury in humans, clinical studies have demonstrated that a number of other antioxidants are associated with reduced levels of in flammatory markers. 26,27It is postulated that the mechanism through which antioxidants elicit anti-in flammatory effects may be the buffering of highly reactive oxygen species that can no longer activate nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF- kB), a transcription factor that enacts the expression of in flammatory cytokines. In situations of excessive oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species can activate Toll-like receptor 4, which in turn stimulates NF- kB activity.28Such a situation is likely to occur after hip fracture as both bone fractures29and long-bone xative surgery6generate high levels oxidative stress. Thus, the antioxidant activity of vitamin E and the carotenoids may reduce these highlevels of oxidative stress following hip fracture, resulting in decreased NF- kB activity and in flammatory cytokine expression.Table 2 Adjusted associations between vitamin E and aR1.

D 'Adamo et al. / Clinical Nutrition 31 (2012) 659 e665 662Author's personal copy While higher concentrations of these antioxidants were asso- ciated with less in flammation throughout the year after hip frac- ture, both the carotenoids and vitamin E were more strongly associated with sTNF- aR1 than IL-6. The explanation for this difference is unclear, though it has been shown that NF- kB plays an especially critical role in the expression of the in flammatory cyto- kine TNF- a. Therefore, antioxidant suppression of NF- kB activity could explain the particularly strong associations noted between sTNF- aR1, vitamin E, and the carotenoids. The pathways for expression of IL-6 are considerably more complicated than TNF- aand it is possible that antioxidants may not have as much of a direct effect on IL-6. Future studies will be needed to verify thishypothesis. This study is the rst to assess the relationship between common dietary antioxidants and in flammatory markers in a cohort of hip fracture patients, a population commonly burdenedwith persistent in flammation. Moreover, one of the strengths of this analysis was the longitudinal assessment of both antioxidantand in flammatory biomarker concentrations at various points throughout the year after hip fracture. This enabled us to track howthese important dietary antioxidants changed throughout the year after hip fracture. Additionally, we were able to compare themagnitude and direction of the associations between the antioxi-dants and in flammatory markers at various stages of hip fracture recovery. In doing so, we found that the associations betweenvitamin E, the carotenoids, and in flammatory markers were generally strongest at baseline. On a potentially related note, ouranalyses also revealed that antioxidant concentrations were lowest and in flammatory marker concentrations were highest at the baseline visit. This particular nding might explain why the rela- tionship between the dietary antioxidants and in flammatory markers was strongest at baseline. It has been suggested that serumantioxidants are utilized, and thus depleted, around the time of traumatic injury to help ameliorate the damage incurred in part by inflammatory cytokines. 30 A related strength of this study was our serum assessment of the carotenoids and vitamin E. Serum concentrations are considered the \"gold standard \"of dietary intake of these micronutrients as the potential for recall bias associated with most questionnaire-basedmeasurement devices is minimized, 31thereby strengthening the dietary inferences of this study. When taken in consideration withprevious evidence of near complete depletion of antioxidants after surgery, 32ourndings suggest that the trauma of the hip fracture injury and subsequent surgery might also deplete serum stores ofTable 4 Adjusted aR1 [pg/mL] Baseline 12 months Total Carotenoids L513 [ /C0906,/C0120] (0.01) of **Bold type level.

D 'Adamo et al. / Clinical Nutrition 31 (2012) 659 e665 663Author's personal copy dietary antioxidants shortly after the injury. Pre-and post- injury assessments would be necessary to con rm this hypothesis. Nevertheless, consumption of nuts, leafy green vegetables, fruitsand other foods rich in vitamin E and carotenoids shortly after hip fracture might help normalize concentrations of these important antioxidants shown to be associated with lower levels of in flam- matory markers. Though clinical trials are necessary to corroboratethese ndings, consumption of nutrient-dense foods might offer some protection against the potentially adverse effects of in flam- mation following hip fracture. There were also a number of notable limitations of this work. Dietary intake data were not collected in BHS4, and we were consequently unable to directly correlate serum vitamin E and carotenoid concentrations to dietary intake of these micronutrients in this cohort. Thus, despite the fact that prior analyses have established that serum vitamin E and carotenoid concentrations are useful indicators of dietary intake of these micronutrients, 31future studies of hip fracture patients should include both serummeasurements and dietary intake assessment to further strengthen dietary conclusions. Our ndings may also not be generalizable to all hip fracture patients as the BHS4 cohort was exclusively female, relatively healthy, and highly physically and cognitively func- tioning. This highly functioning cohort was the result of a stringent set of inclusion criteria in which only 19% of screened hip fracture patients were deemed eligible to participate in the study. Such a highly functioning cohort was required due to the rigors of participation in an exercise intervention. These rigorous inclusion criteria contributed to the very low incidence of acute complica- tions (aside from urinary tract infections) during the year after hip fracture. The lack of complications and statistical adjustment for urinary tract infections in the regression models minimized this potentially important source of confounding of the relationship between micronutrients and in flammatory markers. While the high functional status may limit the generalizability to more robusthip fracture patients, it also increases applicability to the general population of older adults with similarly high functional levels. A related limitation is that BHS4 was an exercise intervention study and physical activity has been shown to modulate markers of inflammation. 33We implemented several analytical measures to account for the potential confounding of the relationship betweenantioxidants and in flammation introduced by physical activity. First, we adjusted our regression models for study group allocation(exercise vs. control) since the BHS4 exercise group performed more physical activity than the control group. Our analyses were further protected from confounding by physical activity as addi- tional adjustment was made in regression models for the total time spent in physical activity as measured by the Yale Physical Activity Scale. Neither allocation to the exercise group nor total physical activity was meaningfully associated with the in flammatory markers under study at any time point ( p/C210.3). While these ndings were surprising, it was hypothesized in previous work that the BHS4 exercise intervention was not of suf cient intensity to elicit reductions in bone and muscle loss after hip fracture. 34The relatively low level of exercise intensity may also explain the lack ofrelationship between participation in the exercise program and inflammatory markers that was expected in this study. Most post-fracture nutritional interventions to date have focused almost exclusively upon increasing protein and total caloricintakes through nutritional supplement shakes. These interven- tions have demonstrated mixed results in improving hip fracture outcomes, 35,36and more comprehensive nutritional interventions may be necessary to optimize recovery from hip fracture. Theassociations between higher concentrations of serum antioxidants and lower concentrations of in flammatory markers uncovered in this study suggest that a clinical trial increasing the intake of nuts,vegetables, fruits and other foods rich in vitamin E and carotenoidsmay be warranted. Alternatively, a trial evaluating the typical post- fracture nutritional supplement approach with the addition of the six major carotenoids and vitamin E may be a viable and practical strategy for functionally-compromised hip fracture patients with impaired ability to purchase, prepare, and consume healthy meals. In light of the moderate success of post-fracture protein shake supplementation, adding reasonable levels of the absorption 37to the synthetic d-alpha tocopherol used in most clinical trials to date) to such a shake may be worthy of evaluation.Such a dietary intervention geared toward attenuating persistently elevated levels of in flammation could reveal a safe and cost- effective route toward potentially expedited and more completerecovery from hip fracture.

Abernethy Received: 19 August 2011 /Accepted: 14 November 2011 /Published online: 29 November 2011 #Springer-Verlag 2011 Abstract Purpose Spiritual care is an important part of healthcare, especially when facing the crisis of advanced cancer. Do oncology inpatients receive spiritual care consistent with their needs? When inconsistent, are there deleterious effectson patient outcomes? Methods Patients with advanced cancer ( N0150) were sur- veyed during their inpatient stay at a southeastern medical center using validated instruments documenting spirituality,quality of life, mood, and satisfaction with care. Relation- ships between the receipt of less spiritual care than desired and patient outcomes were examined.Results Almost all patients had spiritual needs (91%) and the majority desired and received spiritual care from theirhealthcare providers (67%; 68%), religious community (78%; (45%; 36%). However, a significant subset received less spiritual care than desiredfrom their healthcare providers (17%), religious community (11%), and chaplain (40%); in absolute terms, the number who received less care than desired from one or moresources was substantial (42 of 150). Attention to spiritual care would improve satisfaction with care while hospitalized for 35% of patients. Patients who received less spiritual carethan desired reported more depressive symptoms [adjusted (SE)01.2 (0.47), p00.013] and less meaning and peace [adjusted (SE)02.37 (1.15), p00.042]. Conclusions A substantial minority of patients did not receive the spiritual care they desired while hospitalized. When spir- itual needs are not met, patients are at risk of depression and reduced sense of spiritual meaning and peace. Spiritual careshould be matched to cancer patients 'needs. Keywords Spiritual needs .Advanced cancer patients . Spiritual care .Quality of life .Depression .Inpatient Spirituality plays an important and relevant role in the provision and receipt of healthcare [ 1], particularly at the end of life. A growing body of research shows that many patients want their physicians to discuss spiritual issues with them [ 2,3]. Even among nonreligious patients, 45% want their physician to make a polite inquiry [ 4], and there is evidence that even if patients don 't want their spiritual needs met, meeting those needs is associated with greater satisfac-tion with care [ 5]. Major healthcare organizations now strongly recommend, and some require, that their members assess spirituality and provide spiritually sensitive care [ 6-8]; failing to do so today does not meet the standard of care.M.

Support of spiritual needs in outpatient medical settings is associated with greater satisfaction and perceived quality of care [ 2], less depression [ 10], higher quality of life [ 9,10], greater hospice use [ 11], and de- creased medical care costs [ 12]. Several studies have docu- mented deficits in spiritual care provision for advanced cancer patients. For example, in a sample of 369 canceroutpatients, 73% reported having at least one spiritual need; of these patients, 18% reported that their spiritual needs were not being met [ 2]. In another sample of 230 advanced cancer outpatients, 72% reported that the medical system supported their spiritual needs minimally or not at all [ 9]. Hospitalization can be a time of intense distress. Hospitalized advanced cancer patients frequently have acute physical needs, poor functional status, and substantial emotional distress. It follows that support of advanced cancerpatients 'holistic needs, including their unique spiritual needs, would be important. But, there is a paucity of information on the importance of spiritual care for cancer inpatients and onhow spiritual care influences quality of life, well-being, and satisfaction with healthcare. Available data from 2,768 general medicine inpatients demonstrated that 41% wanted a discus- sion about spiritual concerns but that the need was not met in one half of these patients [ 5]. To advance spiritual support for people with cancer, it follows that we should distinguish between patients who want their medical team to provide spiritual care and those who donot, as well as to identify patients who are not receiving the extent of spiritual care they desire. What if we do not? Does discrepancy between the desire for and receipt of spiritual carefrom the medical team adversely affect patient-centered out- comes among inpatients with advanced cancer? To answer this question, we surveyed a sample of culturally diversehospitalized advanced cancer patients to examine: (1) the proportion who do not receive the spiritual care that they desire and (2) the relationship between receipt of less spiritualcare than desired and patient-centered outcomes. We hypoth- esized that patients who receive less spiritual care than desired will have lower quality of life and spiritual well-being andmore depressive symptoms. Methods ParticipantsPotential participants were recruited during 2008 -2010 from the malignant hematology and solid tumor oncologyinpatient units at Duke University Medical Center. Consent- ing participants were: (1) adults (age 18) diagnosed with advanced cancer of any subtype (stage III or IV solid tumorsor lymphoma, or acute leukemia), for whom the treating physician or midlevel provider indicated that he/she would not be surprised if the patient were to die of their cancerwithin the next 12 months [ 13]; (2) receiving care from the hematology/oncology inpatient service; (3) cognitively capa- ble of completing questionnaires; and (4) fluent in English.The study was approved by the Duke University Health System Institutional Review Board. Measures Clinical information was extracted from the patients 'medical record. Participants completed the following assessments: Demographic information Participants reported age, gender, race, marital status, education level, religious affiliation, loca- tion of residence, and cancer diagnosis. Spiritual well-being The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy \u2014Spiritual Well-being (FACIT- Sp) [ 14] measures the extent to which medical patients experienced aspects of spiritual well-being in the past week (00\"not at all \"to 4 0\"very much \") and consists of two empirically validated subscales: The meaning and peace subscale made up of eight items that measure a sense of meaning, purpose, harmony, and extent to which patientsdraw comfort from themselves. The faith subscale consists of four items that assess the extent to which patients find strength and comfort in their religious faith and rely on theirfaith to cope. Spiritual needs and spiritual care Eleven items were devel- oped for this study to assess the degree to which patients desired and received spiritual care from their medical team, religious community, and hospital chaplain. One item asked\"Would attention to your spirituality and spiritual care im- prove your satisfaction with care at Duke University Hospi- tal?\"After the first seven patients were enrolled, we added eight questions to assess specific spiritual needs, adapted from the spiritual needs assessment scale [ 15]. All items were rated on a five-point scale (0 0\"not at all \"and 5 0\"to the largest extent possible \"). Quality of life The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- General (FACT-G) [ 16] comprises 27 questions that assess well-being in four domains: physical, functional, emotional, and social. Both the total score and the individual subscalescores have demonstrated good internal consistency and reliability. The social well-being FACT-G subscale was not used in analyses because of a ceiling effect in the responses. Depressive symptoms The Center for Epidemiological Stud- ies Depression (CES-D) Symptoms Index Short Form, a2270 Care Cancer (2012) 20:2269 -2276 Author's personal copyfive-item self-report scale, is a brief version of commonly used 20-item CES-D that assesses depressive feelings and behaviors over the last week. The briefer form assesses thesame symptoms and has similar sensitivity and specificity as does the longer scale [ 17]. Statistical analyses Descriptive statistics (i.e. , means, medians, and standard deviations for continuous data, and frequency counts and proportions for categorical data) were reported asappropriate. Linear regression was used to assess the relationship between receiving less overall spiritual care from one or more sources (i.e. healthcare professionals,religious community, or hospital chaplain) than desired and quality of life (FACT-G a nd subscales), depressiveTable 1 Characteristics of sample population ( N0150) Characteristic Number Percent Gender Female 69 46Male 81 54 Age at consent Age65 years 90 60 Age >65 years 60 40Mean (SD) 58.6 (14.2) Race Black or African American 26 17 Caucasian 110 73Other 12 8 Educational status <Bachelor 's degree 81 54 Bachelor 's degree and above 60 40 Marital status Married 112 75Not married 37 25 Location a Local 47 31Not local 91 61 Religion Catholic 16 11Jewish 2 1Protestant 118 79Other 8 5None 6 4 Cancer diagnosis Leukemia/myeloma 68 45 Lymphoma 26 17Other 47 31 AKPS (%), n0100) b 20-40 26 17 50-70 80-100 39 26 Median 70Days hospitalized ( Mean (SD) 9.1 (11.1) FACT-G emotional well-being ( Mean (SD) 17.1 (5.0) functional Mean (SD) 68.4 meaning/peace n0143) (SD) 25.3 Number Percent FACIT-Sp total ( n0143) Mean (SD) 39.2 (7.2) CES-D: depressive symptoms ( n0140)e Mean (SD) 5.7 (2.5) The total Nmay not sum to 150 patients for specific characteristics due to missing data, unless otherwise noted.

Length of hospital stay and Australian-modified Karnofsky Performance Status were not considered as covariates due tomissing data. A two-sided significance level of p<0.05 was used for all analyses. SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used. Results Participants Among the 268 patients eligible for participation, 118 de- clined enrollment and 150 were consented to participate. The main reasons given for not participating were \"not interested \"(n042),\"too ill \"(n033), reason not provided (n035), and \"other \"(n08). Potential differences between consenters and nonconsenters were not reported due to unavailable demographic data for nonconsenters. Partici- pants were 54% male, on average 59 14] years of age, 25% non-Caucasian, married (75%),and primarily Protestant (79%). Median performance status was 70% (see Table 1). Spiritual needs Eighty-five percent of patients stated that spirituality played a \"large to the largest extent possible \"role in their overall health and recovery. Thirty-five percent of patients reported that attention to their spirituality and spiritual care would improvetheir satisfaction with care at Duke University Hospital. Of the 143 patients queried about spiritual needs, 130 (91%) indicated having one or more spiritual needs (median 04). The percent- age of patients who endorsed experiencing each of the eight specific spiritual needs is displayed in Table 2. Spiritual care desire vs. spiritual care received Two thirds of patients (67%) reported that they had a mod- erate or greater desire for their medical team to support their spiritual needs and 68% reported that their medical team had provided spiritual care to this extent. The majority ofpatients (78%) reported that they had a moderate or greater desire for their religious community to support their spiritual needs and 73% reported that their religious community had provided spiritual care to this extent. Almost half (45%) of patients reported that a visit by a hospital chaplain would behelpful to a moderate or greater extent during their hospitali- zation; 36% reported having received a visit by a chaplain (see Table 3). We assessed the consistency between desired and received spiritual care. We considered a discrepancy between desired and received to be a two- or more point difference betweenreports for these variables on a five-point scale [e.g., desire Table 2 Summary of spiritual needs ( N0143) Reported as a spiritual needa Spiritual need questions No Yes Number Percent Number Percent At any time during your hospital stay, have you wanted a connection with a higher power? 15 10 116 81 At any time during your hospital stay, have you wanted to address concerns about life after death? 103 72 31 22 At any time during your hospital stay, have you wanted to forgive yourself or others? 63 44 71 50At any time during your hospital stay, have you wanted to have someone pray with or for you? 37 26 97 68At any time during your hospital stay, have you wanted to make sense of why this happened to you? 84 59 51 36At any time during your hospital stay, have you wanted to participate in religious or spiritual services? 80 56 54 38At any time during your hospital stay, have you wanted to perform religious or spiritual rituals? 107 75 27 19At any time during your hospital stay, have you wanted to read spiritual or religious material or watch spiritual or religious programs on TV?55 38 81 57 After the first seven patients were enrolled, these eight questions were added to assess specific spiritual needs.

Of the patients that had a moderate or greater desire for the healthcare team to support their spiritual needs, 17% (16 of95) received less than the care they desired. Of the patients that had moderate or greater desire for their religious commu- nity to support their spiritual needs, 11% (13 of 117) receivedless than the care they desired. Of patients that thought it would be helpful to be visited by a chaplain, 40% (27 of 68) had not received such a visit (see Table 3). Less than desired overall spiritual care and well-being outcomes We explored the relationship between study outcomes and receiving less spiritual care than desired. Twenty-eight percent(42 of 150) received less overall spiritual care than desired from one or more sources (i.e., medical team, religious com- munity, or chaplain).

Discussion The majority of advanced cancer patients have spiritual needs while hospitalized, believe that spirituality plays a major role in their health and recovery, and desire spiritual care from their healthcare team, religious community, and/orhospital chaplain. A high proportion of the patients desiring spiritual support received it.

People who received less spiritual care than they desired were at signif- icantly greater risk of depressive symptoms and lower senseof spiritual well-being, defined as poorer sense of purpose in life, meaning and peace. In addition, 35% stated that atten- tion to their spirituality and spiritual needs would improvetheir satisfaction with care while hospitalized. Almost all patients reported having at least one spiritual need (91%); the most frequent were a desire for a connectionw i t hah i g h e rp o w e r( 8 1 % )a n dad e s i r et oh a v es o m e o n ep r a y with them (68%). The number of patients who endorsed hav- ing spiritual needs was higher than previous studies examiningspiritual needs among nonhospitalized advanced cancer patients [ 2,3]; this may reflect the distress of hospitalization and advanced care or some other sociocultural evolution. Asubstantially greater percent of participants reported receiv- ing spiritual support from their inpatient healthcare team (68%) compared to previous studies. This may reflect thatspiritual care is less prevalent for outpatients (see [ 9]) or general medicine inpatients (see [ 5]), or something unique about the patients and/or healthcare providers at Duke Medical Center. Prior research has shown that inpatient status and illness severity pr edict greater patient desire and greater physician provision of spiritual care [ 18]. Cultural differences may also explain the contrast, as our sample resides in the Southeastern United States, a regionthat is historically known to be more religious, whereas Williams and colleagues '[5] sample resided in Chicago and the majority of Balboni and colleagues '[9] sampleresided in the Northeast. Support for this hypothesis comes from a recent report by Balboni and colleagues [ 12] whose sample included additional cancer patients from the South (i.e., Texas) to the sample in their earlier report [ 9]. In this larger sample, patients residing in the South reported receiv- ing more spiritual care than did those in the Northeast, and 55% of the total sample endorsed receiving spiritual carefrom a moderate to largest extent possible, a percentage that is closer to that of the current study (68%). It may be that patients in the South desire more spiritual care and conse-quently receive it. Medical professionals in the South may also be more likely to see spiritual care as their responsibil- ity than do those in the Northeast. For example, patients inour study received fewer visits from chaplains than did patients in Balboni and colleagues 'study [ 9] (36% vs. 52%), but more spiritual care from the medical team (68%vs. 28%). In Williams and colleagues 'study [ 5], only 8% of patients had a spirituality-focused discussion with a physi- cian. Overall, these observations support an approach tospiritual care that is tailored to patient needs, culturally appropriate, and aligned with personal and regional expectations. Despite the fact that more patients in this sample reported receiving spiritual care from their medical team, there was asubset of patients who had a moderate or greater desire for spiritual care who received less care than they desired from their healthcare team (17%), religious community, (11%), orhospital chaplain (40%) while hospitalized. These results are similar to those of Williams and colleagues [ 5] who found that nearly half of general medicine inpatients whoTable 4 Linear regression models for the association between receipt of less overall spiritual care than desired and QOL, depressive symptoms, and spiritual well-being Outcome 0.167 FACT-G functional well-being 139 1.16 0.282 116 0.23 1.36 0.864 FACT-G 2.22 3.06 0.469 Sample size varied because of missing data.

Notably, patients in our sample of hospitalized advanced cancer patients who re-ceived less spiritual care than they desired from their health- care team, religious community, or chaplain reported greater depressive symptoms and lower levels of spiritual well-being. These findings are consistent with previous research revealing that spiritual concerns and lack of meaning and peace are associated with poorer psychological well-beingand quality of life among cancer patients [ 3,11,19]. This is the first study to examine depression and spiritual care received. This finding has important clinical implicationsgiven the established relationship between depression, func- tional disability, and mortality, particularly among the med- ical patients [ 20]. Moreover, the potential to reduce depressive symptoms through the provision of spiritual sup- port is in line with the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations 'regulations [ 7] requiring that all hospitalized patients receive a spiritual assessment, as well as national and international palliative care guidelines [ 8]. Limitations of this study include the cross-sectional de- sign, which precludes statements of causality. Second, we intentionally chose to use a short measure of depressive symptoms because of the emotional and physical limitations of hospitalized advanced cancer patients. Previous studies with advanced cancer patients have revealed that data col-lected are most accurate when brief assessment batteries are used, containing only the most critical elements [ 21]. How- ever, it remains to be seen how depression and other psy-chological disorders as defined by the DSM-IV are associated with a discrepancy between desired and received spiritual care. Third, our measure of spiritual care preferen-ces and needs was not validated, although 8 of the 19 questions were drawn from a previously validated mea- sure [ 15]. Fourth, our sample was highly religious, predom- inately Protestant, and drawn from one location in the South limiting the generalizability of the results. Finally, because of the sample size and high prevalence of matched spiritualcare to desire for individual sources of spiritual care, we could not examine the association of discrepant desired and received spiritual care for specific sources of care. This is the first study to provide a snapshot of the rela- tionships between spiritual care needs and patient outcomes among hospitalized advanced cancer patients. What are theimplications for clinical practice? Spiritual care matters to patients. It is clearly important to identify patients with a discrepancy between the amounts of spiritual care and sup-port that they desire and that which we, as healthcare pro- fessionals, provide or facilitate. Not all spiritual care needs come from the medical team; the religious community andchaplains were important sources of support for these patients and the healthcare system can facilitate access. When needs are not met, patients are at risk for depressionand reduced sense of spiritual meaning and peace. Providing patients with the spiritual care they desire may be one way we can improve satisfaction with care for a number ofhospitalized advanced cancer patients. Larger studies, from diverse geographic areas and populations, are needed, espe- cially to help us understand the overall implications of thesefindings globally on patient suffering, quality of life, adap- tive psychological adjustment style, and mortality [ 19,20]. And, development and provision of spiritually orientedinterventions that match patients 'spiritual care desires and needs to care provided may be an important next step in advanced cancer patient care.

Click here. www.ArthritisToday.org Acupuncture and Osteoarthritis Research is mixed when it comes to needle sticks relieving OA pain. But does the research tell the whole story? By Timothy Gower People with osteoarthritis (OA) who seek symptom relief outside of mainstream medicine have many options, from exotic herbal preparations to hands-on treatments such as massage and chiropractic. However, just 1 or 2 percent of OA patients choose to try acupuncture, despite the popularity of this ancient therapy for treating other conditions. That's unfortunate, say physicians who practice acupuncture or refer patients to specialists for treatments. While poking someone with a pin to cure pain may seem counterintuitive, they insist that acupuncture often provides modest symptom improvement and serves as a useful add-on therapy for people struggling with aching joints. One barrier to greater acceptance may be that many studies have found acupuncture to offer minimal benefits for OA, at best. Yet researchers point out that designing clinical trials to test acupuncture - and interpreting their results - is tricky business, which may misrepresent the true value of pinprick therapy. How Does Acupuncture Work - and How Well? Acupuncture has been practiced for thousands of years and plays an important role in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Acupuncturists treat medical conditions by inserting slender metal needles into the skin at specific points on the body. According to principles of TCM, health is governed by the flow of energy (known as qi) throughout the body along pathways called meridians. Illness occurs when this energy flow is disrupted or becomes unbalanced, the theory goes. Precise insertion of acupuncture needles is said to restore the flow of this essential energy and improve health. Western medicine doesn't recognize the concepts of qi and meridians. However, a solid body of scientific evidence suggests alternate explanations for why acupuncture might provide pain relief. \"There's a lot of research that says when we put an acupuncture needle into the body, a number of physiological mechanisms occur,\" says Brian Berman, MD, a professor of family and community medicine and director of the University of Maryland Center for Integrative Medicine. A well-placed needle insertion sets off a cascade of events, Dr. Berman explains, producing a signal that travels along the spinal cord to the brain, triggering a release of neurotransmitters called endorphins and enkephalins, which scientists believe reduce the sensation of pain.9/25/12 Arthritis Today www.arthritistoday.org/conditions/osteoarthritis/oa-beyond-the-basics/oa-and-acupuncture-print.phpResearch also shows that the inserting an acupuncture needle induces production of cortisol, a hormone that helps to control inflammation. Acupuncture may stimulate activity of other pain- relieving chemicals in the body, as well. But do all these biochemical changes relieve sore, stiff joints? In the largest study of its kind ever conducted, Dr. Berman and his colleagues recruited 570 men and women over 50 who had osteoarthritis of the knee. Some of the study subjects were placed in a group that received 23 acupuncture treatments over the course of a half year or so. For comparison, the researchers gave a control group of study participants a placebo, or phony treatment designed to simulate acupuncture; the investigators used specially designed fake needles that produced the sensation of pinpricks, but didn't pierce the skin. The 2004 trial, which was published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, found that after 26 weeks, patients receiving real acupuncture felt significantly less pain and functioned better (as measured by how far they could walk in six minutes) than their counterparts who received fake acupuncture. The Trouble with Fake Acupuncture Yet, many other studies comparing real acupuncture to fake or \"sham\" acupuncture for OA have found needle therapy to be much less effective, points out researcher Eric Manheimer, the lead author of a major 2010 review of the scientific literature on acupuncture and OA and a colleague of Dr. Berman's at the University of Maryland. However, there are several reasons why trials using sham acupuncture as a placebo may produce disappointing - and misleading - results, Manheimer explains. Placebos used in clinical trials are supposed to be inert and have no medicinal value. Yet the fake needles used as placebos in some trials may have stimulated acupuncture points even if they didn't penetrate the skin. In other trials, investigators have performed sham acupuncture by using real needles, but inserting them randomly - that is, they avoided traditional acupuncture points. However, some scientists believe that any piercing of the skin could stimulate the neurochemical changes associated with acupuncture. In these scenarios, says Manheimer, unintended pain relief brought on by sham acupuncture may have distorted the study results, since in some cases the fake treatments behaved too much like real acupuncture. Meanwhile, much greater benefits for OA have been found in research trials where sham acupuncture isn't used as a placebo. In these studies, patients undergoing acupuncture have been compared to other patients who received only standard care such as pain relievers and physical therapy. Unlike placebo-controlled studies, in these trials patients in the treatment group knew they were receiving real acupuncture. Some critics argue that these studies aren't reliable, since patients who know they're getting an active treatment may be biased, making them more inclined to report feeling less pain and disability. But Dr. Berman feels that these types of studies reflect how medicine works in the real world. \"We're people, and we have our expectations and beliefs. That can be a big part of the overall effect\" of acupuncture or any therapy, he says. Not For Everyone Acupuncture doesn't seem to work for everyone, but slightly more than half of patients with moderate OA will experience some benefit, says pain specialist James N. Dillard, MD, former medical director of Columbia University's Rosenthal Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. Dr. Dillard believes that acupuncture is superior to corticosteroid injections, a common treatment for OA, and just as effective as frequently prescribed drugs such as duloxetine and tramadol. \"And it's incredibly safe,\" he adds.9/25/12 Arthritis Today www.arthritistoday.org/conditions/osteoarthritis/oa-beyond-the-basics/oa-and-acupuncture-print.phpSide effects, such as bleeding and bruising, are uncommon. By contrast, notes Dr. Dillard, many patients can't tolerate non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and other OA medications. \"The adverse side effects a patient may have with those drugs are way, way worse,\" he says. If you decide to try acupuncture, ask your doctor for a referral or check with an organization such as the American Academy of Medical Acupuncture (www.medicalacupuncture.org). Find out if a practitioner is licensed and ask what type of acupuncture he or she practices. There are several forms of the therapy, including electroacupuncture, in which needles are connected to wires that deliver a mild electrical current. (Electroacupuncture generates a greater release of pain-blunting neurochemicals, according to some practitioners.) Some health insurance plans cover the cost of acupuncture. If it isn't covered under your plan, expect to pay anywhere from $60 to $150 per session. Certain forms of OA may respond better than others to acupuncture. Patients with OA of the knee and spine appear to have the most success, says rheumatologist Scott Zashin, MD, a clinical assistant professor of internal medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School at Dallas. Dr. Zashin, who practices electroacupuncture on occasion, says it can take three or more sessions before symptoms begin to improve and that benefits usually last a month or so, after which follow-up treatment is necessary. He believes that acupuncture can provide important pain relief as part of an overall plan for managing OA. Adds Dr. Zashin: \"I think we should be using it more often.\"NMLNLNO ^\u00c5\u00ec\u00e9\u00ec\u00e5\u00c5\u00ed\u00ec\u00ea\u00c9=o\u00c9\u00c7\u00ec\u00c5\u00c9\u00eb=`~\u00e5\u00c5\u00c9\u00ea=m~\u00e1\u00e5=J=r\u00e5\u00e1\u00eeK=\u00e7\u00d1=j~\u00ea\u00f3\u00e4~\u00e5\u00c7=p\u00ed\u00ec\u00c7\u00f3 NLN \u00dc\u00c9~\u00e4\u00ed\u00dc\u00c5\u00e3\u00e1K\u00c5\u00e7\u00e3L\u00e1\u00e5\u00c7\u00c9\u00f1K\u00e9\u00dc\u00e9L~\u00c5\u00ec\u00e9\u00ec\u00e5\u00c5\u00ed\u00ec\u00ea\u00e1\u00eb\u00edJ\u00e5\u00c9\u00ef\u00ebJ\u00e7\u00e5\u00e4\u00e1\u00e5\u00c9LSOMJ~\u00c5\u00ec\u00e9\u00ec\u00e5\u00c5\u00ed\u00ec\u00ea\u00c9\u00c5\u00c9\u00ec\u00c5~\u00e5\u00c5\u00c9\u00ea\u00e9~\u00e1\u00e5\u00c4~\u00e4\u00ed\u00e1\u00e3\u00e7\u00ea\u00c9\u00e3~\u00ea\u00f3\u00e4~\u00e5\u00c7Acupuncture Reduces Cancer Pain - Univ. of Maryland Study Auricular Acupuncture30 SEPTEMBER 2012 Acupuncture relieves cancer pain due to medication side effects according to new research conducted at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore. Treatment for multiple myeloma (MM), cancer of plasma cells that affects bone marrow, is treated with the pharmaceutical drug bortezomib. Peripheral neuropathy, damage to peripheral nerves, is a common side effect causing pain in cancer patients taking bortezomib. The new research finds that acupuncture is effective for relieving peripheral neuropathy pain due to bortezomib intake in cancer patients. This finding affects cancer treatments in that bortezomib induced pain is a dose-limiting factor. The researchers conclude, \"Acupuncture is a viable treatment option for MM patients experiencing painful BIPN (bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy).\" Acupuncture Prescription Patients were given acupuncture at a rate of 1-2 times per week or once every two weeks dependent upon clinical pain reduction responses. Acupuncture needles were retained for a total of 25 minutes per treatment. Points used in the study were: auricular shen men, auricular point zero, two auricular patients experienced pain reduction immediately following the first acupuncture visit. No adverse reactions were associated with the acupuncture treatments and patients experienced long lasting pain relief.

Maryland's Mini -Med School provides free education about lead poisoning, lupus and drugs BY ANTHONY C. HAYES \u00b7 OCTOBER 15, 2012 Mid term in any school setting is an excellent time for reflection. It offers the students a chance to measure the value of their chosen course of study; to weigh the benefits of their time spent in a darkened lecture hall against the demands of a busy l ife. If continued attendance alone is any barometer of appreciation, then the benefits are far outweighing the costs for the more than three hundred students enrolled in Mini -Med School. Mini-Med School is a community outreach program, offered free of charge by The University of Maryland Medical School . The workshop is designed to give attendees a layman's education in a broad range of important medical topics. In session I, we learned about sleep disorders and Lyme disease. Sessions II and III offered four more compelling topics. Dr. Laura H. Finkelstein, assistant professor in the department of pediatrics, delivered a timely and important talk on lead poisoning. The overall cost of lead related healthcare in the U.S. alone is a staggering $43.5 billion dollars a year. Lead is a soft, flexible metal, found in a variety of products, from car batteries and fishing tackle to stained glass, ammunition and imported pottery. Historically, lead was also used in women's make- up; in plumbing pipes; as an additive to gasoline and as a base for ordinary house paint. It is in old pipes and in paint that lead presents the greatest dangers to people today. Lead is sweet tasting and children who grow up in older homes are especially at risk for ingesting the dangerous metal. Studies have shown that lead can cause severe neurological problems including hearing loss, poor nerve conduction and cognitive and behavioral troubles. For every level of lead in the body greater than 10mcg/dl, a child may lose 2- 3 points of I.Q. level. To make matters worse, molecularly, lead resembles calcium and iron. The body will confuse the three and store lead as it would the other two crucial minerals. Studies show that lead stored in the bones can stay there for more than 25 years, increasing iron deficiency which can lead to lead poisoning. Malnourished children are especial ly susceptible to this phenomena, though interestingly, health enthusiasts who fast may be at risk as well. A body depleted of minerals through fasting will latch onto lead as a quick substitute for missing iron and calcium. Among the many ways adults can contract the disease are by ingesting lead dust from old painted windows, from food which was grown in contaminated soil, or from exposure in jobs like construction, plumbing, auto repair, glass and rubber manufacturing and police work. Hobbyists like hunters, fishers, glazed pottery makers, painters and handymen are also at risk. Finkelstein noted that since 1971, the Centers for Disease Control has seven times redefined what it considers the toxic level for lead. Prior to 1971, the toxic level was counted as anything over sixty micrograms/deciliter (mcg/dl). Today that number has been reduced to anything greater than only five mcg/dl. The fight against lead poisoning has been aided by legislation like the Clean Air Act. The 1970 statute set standards to remove lead from gasoline. The act was hailed at the time, though the initial goal of phasing out lead for consumers by 1979 was not actually achieved until 1995. Thankfully, statistics show a rapid decline in the prevalence of the product after a final peak in1980. Even so, some modern race cars and commercial vehicles still run on leaded gasoline. Lead in paint, which was once touted for enhancing the products brightness and durability, has also been reduced to an almost inconsequential level, thanks to standards set in 1978 by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Council. Finkelstein says the best cure for lead poisoning is prevention. \"Screening is the best way to determine if you or your children are at risk.\" In acute cases (over 45 mcg/dl) it is advised to remove the entire family to a lead-free environment. In cases where levels are over 70 mcg/dl, c hildren should be admitted to a hospital for treatment. Finkelstein said that Chelation therapy is an acceptable method of treatment in cases where the levels are over 45mcg/dl. She stressed, however, that one thing people with lead poisoning should avoid is folk remedies. Delia Chiaramonte, assistant professor of family and community medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, talked about the hot button topic of complementary medicine. Chiaramonte was quick to differentiate between the terms, \"complementary medicine\" and the more popular, \"alternative medicine.\" She noted that alternative medicine carries the connotation of \"instead of medicine\" where as complementary medicine incorporates a more integrated approach. Are Americans seriou s about complementary approaches to medicine (CAM's)? It appears they are. In 2007 Americans spent an estimated $33.9 billion dollars on natural products, mind- body therapies, manipulative body - based treatments and other types of CAM practices; most of w hich are not covered by insurance plans. Natural products like ginger have been used for centuries in folk medicine. Today, it is used for the nausea associated with motion sickness, Chemotherapy and pregnancy. Fish Oil supplements, which contain Omega-3 fatty acids are also widely suggested as a possible aid to those with heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis or depression. Another product which has gained widespread acceptance in the world of complementary medicine is probiotics. Dr. Chiaramonte explained the benefits of having \"good bacteria\" in the intestines. These benefits include a reduction in the severity of colds and flu and as an aid to those who suffer from irritable bowel syndrome and Crohn's disease. Chiaramonte pointed out that some forms of CAM, particularly body manipulation, do not have a lot of scientific validation, but are seen as \"no risk\" options in that they do seem to work for some people. Chiaramonte did, however stress that there are dangers to CAM, especially in the are a of drug interactions. St. Johns Wort was given special attention, in that it interacts with so many drugs. Chiaramonte urged the students to keep a list of all the medications they are taking, including supplements, and ask your doctor or pharmacist about possible adverse interactions. Adding to Dr. Chiaramonte's talk about complementary medicine was a succinct presentation on taking medications properly and drug interactions by Cherokee Layson- Wolf, associate professor in the department of pharmacy practice and science at the University of Maryland, School of Pharmacy. Layson- Wolf began by asking how many students could name the drugs they were on. Many could not. She then asked if we always remembered to take our meds at the properly prescribed intervals. Again, most did not. Layso n-Wolf then revealed that in professional circles, people who adhere 100% to their appointed medicine routines are actually considered deviant; that is, almost nobody takes their medicine as prescribed. The reasons for this include: Ignorance of the medic ation's purpose Fear of medicine Questions about interactions Concern about side effects Inability to cover the cost Layson- Wolf urged students to carry a list of their medications with them at all times and to talk with their doctors and pharmacists about any concerns, noting that failure to adhere to prescription guidelines are both costly and deadly. She also suggested practical tools, such as the daily pill box and easy open bottles as means to keep patients on track. For those with special needs or m emory problems, such as Alzheimer's patients, prescription bottle glow caps, such as the ones sold by Vitality may be beneficial. The one down note about the first three sessions of Mini -Med School was the talk about Lupus presented by Dr. Violeta Rus. Dr. Rus is an associate professor in the department of medicine at the University of Maryland. Lupus is one of the most common autoimmune diseases. It affects women almost nine times more than men, with African-American and Hispanic women having a 3-5 fold greater incidence compared to whites. Lupus also appears in the children of mothers with the disease. There are genetic and environmental factors to the disease and those who contract it are at greater risk for heart attack and stroke. Unfortunately, Dr. Rus' talk seemed to meander. Her power points were disorganized, overly technical and difficult to follow. Worse, she inserted charts and slides which were not included in the workbook, leaving many of the students frustrated and lost. In explaining the confusing character of Dr Rus' presentation, Heather Graham Phelps, Director, Communications and Marketing for Office of Communic ations and Public Affairs, told the Baltimore Post -Examiner the professors are requested to submit their material several months in advance of printing of the workbooks. \"Occasionally,\" Phelps explains, \"the doctor will make changes in their power point n otes to reflect the latest research or findings in a given field. Unfortunately, if they've made last minute changes, we cannot update the workbooks. We just hope the students, especially the older ones, are able to follow along.\" Phelps' explanation made perfect sense, still upon exiting the Lupus lecture, I remarked to a friend that if I wanted to get a grasp on the subject now, I felt I would have to research it on my own. My friend replied, \"That kills the whole idea behind this class.\" The workbook does include an evaluation sheet for every session. Students are encouraged to rate the lectures and offer suggestions in areas of concern. Mini-Med School is presented in cooperation with the National Institutes of Health and the Association of American Medical Colleges. It is free and open to the public.

Pearce, M. J., Coan, A. D., Herndon, J. E. 2nd, Koenig, H. G. and Abernethy, A. P. \"Unmet spiritual care needs impact emotional and spiritual well-being in advanced cancer patients.\" Supportive Care in Cancer 20, no. 10 (October 2012): 2269-2276. SUMMARY and COMMENT: This month's study proceeds out of two basic questions: \"Do oncology inpatients receive spiritual care consistent with their needs?\" and \"When inconsistent, are there deleterious effects on patient outcomes?\" [p. 2269, abstract]. The authors name this to be \"the first study to provide a snapshot of the relationships between spiritual care needs and patient outcomes among hospitalized advanced cancer patients\" and \"the first study to examine depression and spiritual care received\" [p. 2275]. Data were analyzed from 150 diverse inpatients with advanced cancer at the Duke University Medical Center (Durham, NC), from a total of 268 eligible patients during 2008-2010. Participants were assessed for spiritual well-being (using the FACIT-Sp --see our February 2004 AoM ), spiritual needs and care (including original items and eight adapted from the Spiritual Needs Survey by Galek, et al. --see our June 2005 AoM), plus quality of life, depressive symptoms, and satisfaction with care. Some of these assessments were added after the first seven patients were enrolled, making the number for several analyses 143. Among the findings: Eighty-five percent of patients stated that spirituality played a \"large to the largest extent possible\" role in their overall health and recovery. Thirty-five percent of patients reported that attention to their spirituality and spiritual care would improve their satisfaction with care at Duke University Hospital. Of the 143 patients queried about spiritual needs, 130 (91%) indicated having one or more spiritual needs.... [p. 2272] Two thirds of patients (67%) reported that they had a moderate or greater desire for their medical team to support their spiritual needs and 68% reported that their medical team had provided spiritual care to this extent. The majority of patients (78%) reported that they had a moderate or greater desire for their religious community to support their spiritual needs and 73% reported that10/17/12 Monthly Article October 2012 2/5 www.acperesearch.net/oct12.htmltheir religious community had provided spiritual care to this extent. Almost half (45%) of patients reported that a visit by a hospital chaplain would be helpful to a moderate or greater extent during their hospitalization; 36% reported having received a visit by a chaplain.... [p. 2272] Of the patients that had a moderate or greater desire for the healthcare team to support their spiritual needs, 17% (16 of 95) received less than the care they desired. Of the patients that had moderate or greater desire for their religious community to support their spiritual needs, 11% (13 of 117) received less than the care they desired. Of patients that thought it would be helpful to be visited by a chaplain, 40% (27 of 68) had not received such a visit.... [p. 2273] Twenty-eight percent (42 of 150) received less overall spiritual care than desired from one or more sources (i.e., medical team, religious community, or chaplain). [p. 2273] Perhaps the most significant finding, however, was that \"[p]eople who received less spiritual care than they desired were at significantly greater risk of depressive symptoms and lower sense of spiritual well-being, defined as poorer sense of purpose in life, meaning and peace\" [p. 2274]. The finding regarding depressive symptoms \"has important clinical implications given the established relationship between depression, functional disability, and mortality, particularly among the medical patients\" [p. 2275]. Chaplain readers may further be quite interested in a table [p. 2272] showing responses to the eight questions asked about specific spiritual needs. The most frequent positive responses were to the items for \"wanted a connection with a higher power\" (81%) and \"wanted to have someone pray with or for you\" (68%). Curiously, the number of patients who identified having spiritual needs was here unusually high in relation to other studies, and it was also the case that a \"substantially greater percent of participants reported receiving spiritual support from their inpatient healthcare team (68%) compared to previous studies\" [p. 2274]. The authors speculate on what may lie behind this finding, including the particular circumstances of advanced cancer inpatients and the geographical culture of the sample [--see p. 2274]. This is a concise article that has strong potential to stimulate discussion and further study. The bibliography is modest, perhaps reflecting the \"paucity of information\" [p. 2270] on the precise subject. A minor note: see below (Related Items of Interest, \u00a7IV) regarding a statement about requirements by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations on p. 2275. Suggestions for the Use of the Article for Discussion in CPE: This article is short and straightforward enough to appeal to those new to the field while being substantive enough to interest advanced researchers. Students unfamiliar with statistics should be able to read easily around the occasional technical language. The introductory paragraphs [pp. 2269-2270] set up well the context of the study, and the results [pp. 2272ff] are nicely explicated. Students may want first to discuss the significance of an unmet spiritual need. Would there be reasons for meeting such needs that do not depend upon clinical outcomes? What does a connection with clinical outcomes add to the consideration of spiritual needs? The needs identified in the article are the result of patients' self-reporting via specific questionnaire items. Might patients have spiritual needs of which they themselves are not aware, which could only be identified through an10/17/12 Monthly Article October 2012 3/5 www.acperesearch.net/oct12.htmlassessment instrument? Discussion could also focus on the table of responses to the eight spiritual needs items [p. 2272] and whether this suggests anything about students' own attention to needs in the clinical setting. For instance, 57% \"wanted to read spiritual or religious material or watch spiritual or religious programs on TV.\" Do patients at your CPE center have easy access to such material or programming, and if not then what might be the reasons for that? For more advanced students, there could be discussion of methodology for future studies, and the article could lead to an exploration of the FACIT-Sp and Spiritual Needs Survey. Related Items of Interest: I. A focus on unmet spiritual needs would seem to be implicit in most spiritual assessments to one degree or another. However, a few articles not cited in this month's featured study that may be of special interest to chaplains are: Hampton, D. M., Hollis, D. E., Lloyd, D. A., Taylor, J. and McMillan, S. C. \"Spiritual needs of persons with advanced cancer.\" American Journal of Hospice and Palliative Care 24, no. 1 (February-March 2007): 42-48. [(From the abstract:) ...Results showed great variability in spiritual needs. Being with family was the most frequently cited need (80%), and 50% cited prayer as frequently or always a need. The most frequently cited unmet need was attending religious services.] Hermann, C. P. \"The degree to which spiritual needs of patients near the end of life are met.\" Oncology Nursing Forum 34, no. 1 (January 2007): 70-78. [This study of 100 hospice patients (both inpatient and outpatient), assessed perception of 17 spiritual needs (with spirituality conceived very broadly) and perception of whether each type of need was met or unmet. Among the findings: 79% said that talking to someone about spiritual issues was a need, and 75% said that this need had been met; 88% said that being with people who shares the same spiritual beliefs was a need, and 74% said that this need had been met; and 85% said that going to religious services was a need, and 30% said that this need had been met. This article uses Hermann's Spiritual Needs Inventory, which is presented in her earlier article, \"Development and Testing of the Spiritual Needs Inventory for Patients Near the End of Life,\" Oncology Nursing Forum 33, no. 4 (July 2006): 737-744. The instrument grew out of a most interesting methodology of asking patients first to define what spirituality means to them and then to identify needs in relation to their definition.

P. \"The Spiritual Needs Assessment for Patients (SNAP): development and validation of a comprehensive instrument to assess unmet spiritual needs.\" Journal of Pain and Symptom Management 44, no. 1 (July 2012): 44-51. [(Abstract:) CONTEXT: Unmet spiritual needs have been associated with decreased patient ratings of quality of care, satisfaction, and quality of life. There is a need for a well-validated, psychometrically sound instrument to describe and measure spiritual needs.10/17/12 Monthly Article October 2012 4/5 www.acperesearch.net/oct12.htmlOBJECTIVES: To develop a valid and reliable instrument to assess patients' spiritual needs. METHODS: Instrument development was based on a literature review, clinical and pastoral evaluation, and cognitive pretesting (n=15 ambulatory cancer patients). Forty-seven ambulatory cancer patients completed cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys to test instrument validity and reliability. Internal reliability was assessed by Cronbach's alpha, test-retest reliability by Spearman's correlation coefficients, and construct validity by comparing instrument scores to a previously used single-item spiritual needs question. RESULTS: The Spiritual Needs Assessment for Patients (SNAP) comprises a total of 23 items in three domains: psychosocial (n=5), spiritual (n=13), and religious (n=5). Sixty percent of participants were white, 21% black, 13% Hispanic, and 6% Asian or other. Fifty- eight percent were Catholic, 13% Jewish, 11% Protestant, 2% Buddhist, 2% Muslim, and 2% Hindu. Sixty-eight percent described themselves as spiritual but not religious; 15% reported unmet spiritual needs; 19% wanted help meeting their spiritual needs. Cronbach's alpha for the total SNAP was 0.95, and for the subscales was psychosocial=0.74, spiritual=0.93, needs=0.51, spiritual needs=0.70, and religious needs=0.65. Participants reporting unmet spiritual needs had significantly higher mean scores on the total SNAP (66.3 vs. 49.4, P=0.03) and on the spiritual needs subscale (39.0 vs. 28.3, P=0.02). CONCLUSION: The results provide preliminary evidence that the SNAP is a valid and reliable instrument for measuring spiritual needs in a diverse patient population.] II. For a study that looks at the spiritual needs of caregivers instead of patients, see: Buck,, H. G. and McMillan, S. C. \"The unmet spiritual needs of caregivers of patients with advanced cancer.\" Journal of Hospice & Palliative Nursing 10, no. 2 (March/April 2008): 91-99. The author uses Hermann's Spiritual Needs Inventory (noted above, \u00a7I) to assess specific needs of caregivers and matches the general score for unmet spiritual needs with scores from the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. Note especially the tables of needs on p. 96. The most frequently indicated unmet spiritual needs were to be with family and to laugh.] III. One of the articles cited in this month's study is especially noteworthy for its association of met/unmet spiritual needs with health care costs at the end of life: Balboni, T., Balboni, M., Paulk, M. E., Phelps, A., Wright, A., Peteet, J., Block, S., Lathan, C., VanderWeele, T., and Prigerson, H. \"Support of cancer patients' spiritual needs and associations with medical care costs at the end of life.\" Cancer 117, no. 23 (December 1, 2011): 5383-5391. This article was featured as our June 2011 Article-of-the-Month IV. This month's article includes the statement that the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations' regulations \"requir[e] that all hospitalized patients receive a spiritual assessment\" [p. 2275, italics added]. This assertion is frequently made in the literature, but while10/17/12 Monthly Article October 2012 5/5 www.acperesearch.net/oct12.htmlthe Joint Commission does publish documents that indicate the value of spiritual assessments (e.g., the 2010 monograph, Advancing Effective Communication, Cultural Competence, and Patient- and Family-Centered Care: A Roadmap for Hospitals), the actual accreditation standards for acute care hospitals only require such assessment for inpatients receiving end-of-life care or treatment for behavioral health and substance abuse issues, and in the context of an assessment of factors affecting patient education. For a summary of the 2012 acute care hospital standards mentioning spirituality, religion, beliefs, and cultural diversity, see: www.uphs.upenn.edu/pastoral/resed/JCAHOrefs.pdf (by J. Ehman). Spiritual assessment is given greater emphasis in the standards for home care/hospice.

Now, research is closing in on how it works. A major study released by Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in 2012 that looked at almost 18,000 patients confirms the ancient therapy relieves chronic back, neck, and shoulder pain; osteoarthritis, and recurring headaches. Additionally, proponents claim needle treatment can ease allergies and anxiety among other health problems. But acupuncture is still controversial in the U.S. One big reason: It's rooted in centuries-old concepts of health and illness in contrast to measurable and reproducible clinical data. \"Acupuncture is based on the ancient Chinese belief that energy called Qi flows throughout the body along meridians\u2014or channels\u2014to create balance and health,\" says Marcos Hsu, an acupuncturist at the University of Maryland Center for Integrative Medicine. As the traditional theory goes, physical pain and illness occur when energy slows or stops flowing in a particular body zone. Inserting tiny needles into related acupuncture points (there are 350 of them) releases the energy and helps the body heal itself. Hsu continues: \"Any blockage or stagnation of energy can cause pain and lead to illness. Each11/28/12 Healing Needles | The Saturday Evening Post 2/3 www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2012/10/17/health-and-family/medical-update/acupuncture.html acupuncture point along the meridians is related to a specific body system or function that can be stimulated by inserting fine needles to restore health. The goal of acupuncture is to promote the body's innate ability to heal by correcting imbalances of energy flow.\" So, how does modern research explain the healing powers of acupuncture? Even though its mechanism of action isn't clear-cut, multiple studies confirm the ancient therapy unleashes good-for- you chemicals throughout the body. \"Many acupuncture studies show beneficial changes in blood circulation and levels of neurochemicals such as endorphins and serotonin that may produce an analgesic effect and suppress pain,\" Hsu says. \"Other scientists suggest pain relief occurs when acupuncture blocks pain signals from reaching the brain via specific nerve fibers. Additionally, some propose the therapy stimulates a localized release of endorphins at the injury site. Regardless of the explanation, research consistently shows that acupuncture relieves pain.\" People respond differently to acupuncture but the treatment is safe and effective, with minimal adverse effects for most patients. That said, individuals with 1) heart problems, 2) metal allergies, 3) skin conditions, 4) bleeding disorders, 5) low immunity, or 6) who are taking anticoagulants should consult their doctor or acupuncturist prior to receiving an initial treatment, Hsu says. With acupuncture drifting into the medical mainstream, more insurance companies are covering the treatment in medical centers and private clinics across the country. To find a practitioner, contact your health insurance carrier for a list of approved providers or consult your doctor for a referral.

Print | Close this window Say Yay for Whey and Lose Weight HealthyWoman from Bottom Line Publication December 2, 2012 Original publication date HealthyWoman from Bottom Line Logo Like many young men, my 20-something sons guzzle whey shakes as a way to add weight, with the goal of getting bigger and stronger. So you may be surprised\u2014even skeptical\u2014when I tell you that whey also can help with weight loss. I kid you not. A new study published in The Journal of Nutrition provides proof, showing that whey protein supplementation helped overweight and obese people drop unwanted pounds and trim belly girth. What's more, whey can help you keep weight off for good. That's because protein is one of the keys to sustainable weight loss and weight management, I heard from Chris D'Adamo, PhD, a nutritional research scientist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore. The pluses of protein: Consuming sufficient protein is an important weight-control strategy. For one thing, protein increases satiety\u2014you feel less hungry after eating protein than after eating carbohydrates or fats, so you're less likely to feel deprived and blow your diet. Also, protein is more thermogenic than carbs and fats, meaning that your body tends to burn it off rather than store it as fat. Protein promotes lean muscle mass, too, which improves metabolism\u2014so you use up more calories without doing anything extra. And there's no need for women to worry about winding up with bulging muscles or a bulked-up appearance, Dr. D'Adamo said. Instead, protein simply promotes a higher muscle-to-fat ratio that results in a healthier body composition and easier weight management. Why whey? Whey protein is a derivative of milk and contains all of the essential amino acids that your body cannot produce on its own. Compared to other protein supplements that have been studied, such as soy and casein (another milk protein), whey is a clear winner for weight control and for overall good health. That's because whey... Increases levels of satiety-boosting hormones, such as leptin and cholecystokinin, more than other proteins do. \"It's tough to lose weight when you're starving yourself and you're hungry all the time. Whey helps prevent that situation of persistent hunger,\" Dr. D'Adamo said. Has the highest bioavailable value among proteins, which means that our bodies can easily absorb and use it. Improves insulin sensitivity, thus lowering the risk for metabolic syndrome, diabetes, coronary artery disease and stroke. Stimulates production of glutathione, an antioxidant that improves liver efficiency, allowing the body to clear toxins and make better use of nutrients. Contains 10% to 15% immunoglobulins, which are known to enhance immune system activity. Is easy to digest. Even people who have problems with lactose (a sugar found in milk) usually can tolerate whey protein. Whey also contains little or no casein, a milk protein that also can cause digestive upset. However, Dr. D'Adamo noted that people with lactose or casein intolerance should initially consume small amounts of whey to test their tolerability. Patients with liver or kidney problems who have been told to monitor their protein intake should check with their doctors before taking any protein supplement. Except for people with a milk allergy, who should avoid whey altogether, whey protein generally is safe.12/5/12 Content 2/2 bottomlinepublications.com/content/article/diet-a-exercise/say-yay-for-whey-and-lose-weight/print?tm...Yummy ways to add whey to your diet: Whey protein powder is sold at health-food stores, drugstores and online. Options include whey concentrate, which is more economical...and whey isolate, which goes through an extra filtering step to remove more fat and carbs (in the form of lactose) and thus may be preferable for people with lactose or casein intolerances who are using whey as a weight-loss aid. One or two servings of whey protein per day should be an appropriate amount for the average woman who wants to lose weight, Dr. D'Adamo said. A one-tablespoon serving contains about 40 calories. Breakfast is a great time to consume your whey because it helps suppress hunger for hours afterward. You also can have some whey about an hour before exercising\u2014it will provide an extra energy burst and help maximize the body-composition benefits of your workout. Combine your whey powder with the cold or hot liquid of your choice, following label directions. Easy recipe ideas... Mix whey powder with plain water for the lowest-calorie protein drink and a neutral taste. For a tastier beverage, add your favorite drink-flavoring product\u2014for instance, Mio Liquid Water Enhancer or Crystal Light lemonade powder. For a smoothie, blend whey powder with milk or juice...berries, bananas or other fruit...and ice. Stir whey powder into hot cereal before cooking...or add to soups or stews before serving.

An abundance of new evidence suggests people in both categories should consider getting more ginger into their diets, as ginger seems to play an important, measurable role in weight management and gastrointestinal health, and has anti-inflammatory and detoxifying benefits as well. Oh, and it might just make you prettier. Last summer, a study by researchers at the Institute for Human Nutrition at Columbia University found that adding a hot ginger beverage to the diet of human subjects made them feel fuller after a meal and less likely to eat more later. \"The results, showing enhanced thermogenesis and reduced feelings of hunger with ginger consumption, suggest a potential role of ginger in weight management,\" the researchers said, calling for additional studies to confirm the findings. For centuries, ginger has been the go-to root for a wide range of GI distresses. Researchers believe its compounds stimulate digestive secretions, improve intestinal muscle tone, and help move food through the gastrointestinal tract. It's safe to take ginger in small doses (less than 1,000 milligrams) for a short period of time during pregnancy, says Joyce Frye, a doctor of osteopathy and clinical assistant professor at the Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore. Got bad period cramps? Try ginger tea. A study in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine found that ginger was as effective as ibuprofen for relieving painful periods. Just steep 2 tablespoons fresh ginger root in water for 15 minutes, strain, and enjoy with honey or lemon. If bumpy flights and long car trips make your stomach turn, try a piece of crystallized or pickled ginger. Ginger worked better than dimenhydrinate (the active ingredient in over-the- counter motion-sickness meds) at preventing and treating motion sickness, according to Brigham Young University research. Fresh ginger\u2014sipped in tea or eaten straight-up\u2014is best, says Sari Greaves, RD, of New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York City. I suggest you make your own low-sugar, super-spicy ginger ale. But ginger in other forms (dried, powdered, cooked) can be effective too. A tea to try: Yogi Lemon Ginger Tea and Traditional Medicinals' Organic Ginger Aid ($4 to $5; grocery stores). Ginger ale? Most brands have little or no real ginger and lots of high-fructose corn syrup. Related stories: Top 7 Natural Cold Remedies: Do They Work?

A recent survey of 29 prominent integrative medical centers revealed that more than half deliver integrative care to patients in the hospitals with which they are affiliated. Using strategies that help lessen anxiety, reduce pain levels and increase patient engagement isn't just good for patients; with the advent of value-based reimbursement, in which payments to hospitals are tied to patient satisfaction, these strategies also might improve bottom lines. The 2012 report Integrative Medicine in America: How Integrative Medicine Is Being Practiced in Clinical Centers Across the United States was commissioned by the Bravewell Collaborative to determine how and to what extent integrative care was being practiced. The study revealed a variety of models delivering integrative interventions to inpatients. Allina Health The Penny George Institute for Health and Healing began providing integrative services \u2014 basic stress- reduction strategies such as guided imagery, aromatherapy, acupressure, biofeedback and massage \u2014 to patients at Alliona Health's Abbott Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis in 2003. To date, integrative interventions (including acupuncture) at Abbott Northwestern have been provided to more than 25,000 patients and have proven so successful in reducing pain, anxiety and nausea that Allina Health recently elevated integrative medicine to a clinical service line (like cardiology, oncology and neuroscience) and is beginning to institute the inpatient program at 10 other Allina hospitals. In an Allina study published in the Journal of Patient Safety, the average reduction in pain scores was 1.9 points, the average pain reduction was approximately 55 percent and roughly 33 percent reported complete pain relief. Allina helps make the program cost-effective through its Transformative Nursing Training Program. This program teaches nurses, who are already being paid, to deliver many of the integrative interventions at the bedside. \"The more people on the front lines who have the tools, the more we can utilize these strategies,\" said Courtney Baechler, M.D., vice president of the Penny George Institute. Through a triage program, patients also have access to acupuncture, Chinese medicine and other integrative interventions that require a licensed practitioner. The cost of these more specialized services is absorbed in hospital overhead or through philanthropy. Baechler noted that in recent inpatient surveys, more than 70 percent of the institute's patients reported high satisfaction. Beth Israel Medical Center The department of integrative medicine at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York offers a variety of integrative interventions to lessen pain, anxiety and nausea, as well as to improve medical outcomes, decrease medication use and accelerate healing. The inpatient program began in 2007 with such modalities as Reiki, acupuncture, yoga and stress management, including biofeedback, guided imagery, aromatherapy and meditation. Patients choose to enter the program or are referred by the physicians and residents. These services generally are funded by private grants; when the service is not available for free, patients can pay for it out of pocket. Acupuncture, which is delivered by licensed acupuncturists through the acupuncture fellowship program, also is supported by private grants and provided without charge to patients. Training grants increase the availability of integrative services. For instance, Beth Israel's Charles Evans Integrative Stress Management Program trains hospital nurses in Reiki, aromatherapy and guided imagery. The Urban Zen Yoga Program supports yoga trainees in providing integrative medical yoga stress-reduction to patients. \"The integrative approach emphasizes patient empowerment and encourages patients to take an active role in their health. Pain, anxiety and nausea, which we measure regularly before and after, are dropping by about two points on a 10-point scale,\" explains Roberta Lee, M.D., vice chair of theNLTLNP e\u00c9~\u00e4\u00ed\u00dc=`~\u00ea\u00c9=n\u00ec~\u00e4\u00e1\u00ed\u00f3=\u00f6=m~\u00ed\u00e1\u00c9\u00e5\u00ed=p~\u00ed\u00e1\u00eb\u00d1~\u00c5\u00ed\u00e1\u00e7\u00e5 OLP \u00ef\u00ef\u00efK\u00dc\u00dc\u00e5\u00e3~\u00d6K\u00c5\u00e7\u00e3L\u00dc\u00dc\u00e5\u00e3~\u00d6Leeka~\u00e1\u00e4\u00f3Leeka~\u00e1\u00e4\u00f3a\u00e1\u00eb\u00e9\u00e4~\u00f3K\u00c7\u00dc\u00ed\u00e3\u00e4\\\u00e1\u00c7ZRSMMMMVRVVdepartment of integrative medicine at Beth Israel Medical Center. California Pacific Medical Center The Institute for Health & Healing at California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco, an affiliate of Sutter Health, provides integrative services to patients admitted to the medical center's four hospitals. These services include holistic nursing, massage, guided imagery, expressive arts, healing harp, medical clowns and spiritual care. Requests for the services, which are coordinated by a clinical nurse specialist, come from physicians, nurses, patients and family members. The integrative practitioners are part of ongoing, interdepartment collaborative programs. In the oncology, pediatrics and palliative care departments, the integrative providers function as part of the medical team, participating in psychosocial rounds and providing patient services, educational events and employee care programs. The program is fully supported by CMPC administrators and medical personnel. \"We absolutely could not provide the level of symptom management we do without the institute's team,\" says Jennifer Cohen, M.D., chair of CMPC's pediatric pain committee. Patient satisfaction scores are regularly 4.9 on a 5-point scale. \"Pain and anxiety are reduced, but the most frequent comment we hear from patients is that these services provide a moment of comfort and care during a very challenging time. Patients tell us how grateful they are to CPMC for providing excellent medical care that includes this support for their whole being,\" said Judith Tolson, director of the institute. While IHH employs dedicated staff, many integrative services are provided by interns who learn integrative strategies as part of a yearlong training program under the leadership of an IHH physician. The majority of the costs for integrative services are covered through philanthropy and proceeds from the institute's on-site store, which sells such things as books, tapes, art, vitamins and supplements. Tolson is working with the hospital administrators to identify other means of reimbursement as the requests for services they receive far outpace their ability to deliver them. A Maryland Collaborative The University of Maryland Center for Integrative Medicine in Baltimore is collaborating with the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center at the University of Maryland Medical Center to provide integrative inpatient services \u2014 including Reiki, sound therapy, guided imagery, \"art for compassion,\" therapeutic music, acupressure, yoga breathwork and meditation \u2014 to trauma patients. These services, which focus on reducing pain, are provided at the request of the patient or attending physician. Provided by trained nurses and funded by the nursing budget, the integrative services are offered at no cost to patients, their family members and hospital staff. The Center for Integrative Medicine, which was founded in 1991, launched the collaborative in August 2006 with one integrative nurse and a few part-time practitioners from the center. Now, the integrative care team, currently comprising four dedicated members, sees 20 to 30 patients a day \u2014 and the demand still far outweighs the team's capacity to fulfill all the requests. Throughout the hospital system a growing number of departments, including the perioperative unit, neurosurgery and the neonatal intensive care unit, are requesting integrative services. \"The success of this program has spurred the development of a prototype program that we envision will one day be offered throughout the University of Maryland Medical Center,\" says Brian Berman, M.D., founder and director of the university's Center for Integrative Medicine. The Big Picture An integrative approach treats the whole person, emphasizes patient empowerment and encourages patients to take an active role in their health. \"I can think of no more important place to make integrative practices available than the inpatient environment, where serious medical crises happen every day,\" says Beth Israel's Lee.

Posted Online: Jan. 07, 2013, 9:48 am Alternative treatments for arthritis Comment on this story By Jeff Schnaufer Older Americans suffering from osteoarthritis may find help in an even older source - ancient Chinese healing treatments and exercise. Studies by U.S. researchers are revealing the potential healing power of acupuncture, Tai Chi exercise and Qigong to reduce the symptoms of osteoarthritis, the most common form of arthritis, which causes pain and reduced motion in the joints and spine. Experts say there is no current medicinal cure for osteoarthritis. In a 2009 study published in Arthritis Care & Research, Dr. Chenchen Wang and colleagues at Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, recruited 40 subjects averaging 65 years of age suffering from knee osteoarthritis to participate in a 60 minute Tai Chi session, instructed by a Tai Chi master, twice weekly for 12 weeks. Tai Chi is a traditional Chinese mind-body exercise that enhances balance, strength and flexibility, and reduces pain, depression and anxiety in diverse patient populations with chronic conditions. \"It's very exciting,\" said Wang, who said the study showed Tai Chi appeared to improve physical function and reduce pain and depression. \"We found that Tai Chi does have a lot of benefits for the elderly for physical and mental conditions.\" In June 2008, Dr. Kevin Chen and fellow researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine Center for Integrative Medicine, Baltimore, published a study in Clinical Rheumatology revealing the effectiveness of external Qigong therapy on people with knee osteoarthritis. External Qigong therapy is similar to therapeutic touch, in which the well-trained healer applies his/her Qi energy to the patient, Chen said. Chinese medicine considers knee arthritis to be caused by Qi blockage in the knee area. Among the three groups treated for two weeks, Chen said \"the placebo group had a 33 percent reduction in pain, the group by Healer 1 had a 35 percent reduction in pain, while the group by Healer 2 had a 55 percent reduction of pain after two weeks of treatment.\" This led Chen to conclude that External QiGong Therapy might have a role in the treatment of osteoarthritis, depending upon the qualities of the healer. Chinese acupuncture also has been studied to aid in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. Dr. Lixing Lao of the Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine has conducted three acupuncture studies from 1993 to 2004, from a small pilot study to a 570 patient clinical trail. \"Patients who were randomly assigned to the acupuncture treatment group had significant pain relief1/8/13 www.qconline.com/archives/qco/print_display.php?id=622361 2/2 www.qconline.com/archives/qco/print_display.php?id=622361\"Patients who were randomly assigned to the acupuncture treatment group had significant pain relief and function improvement as compared to placebo/sham control,\" Lao said. Researchers realize more studies need to be done to incorporate Chinese exercise and healing practices into mainstream medicine in the U.S. But they are seeing hopeful signs. \"Acupuncture is more accepted by the public than any time before,\" Lao said, citing a recently published survey conducted by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Plus, Lao said, more medical acupuncturists are working in hospitals. \"For example, in our University of Maryland School of Medicine, not only is acupuncture service provided by licensed acupuncturists in the center for integrative medicine, but also by medical acupuncturists for their patients in the shock trauma center, cancer center and anesthesiology department.\" 1/15/13 Alternative Medicine Use Common In Kids With Chronic Conditions: Study www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/14/alternative-medicine-use-kids-chronic-conditions_n_2458137.html 1/2 The FHA eliminated its credit score requirement for refinancing.

Advertorials by Alternative Medicine Use Common In Kids With Chronic Conditions: Study Children with chronic health conditions are regularly treated with alternative therapies, according to a new Canadian study that suggests the use of so-called \"complementary and alternative medicine\" in pediatrics is on the rise. Many children in the study took multivitamins or minerals, while others tried treatments like massage, aromatherapy and chiropractic manipulation. \"The use of [alternative medicine] is always going to be much higher in those kids who have a specific condition, particularly one not well- treated with conventional medicine, because parents are always asking, 'What can I do to help my kid?'\" said Dr. Joyce Frye, an integrative physician and epidemiologist with the University of Maryland's Center for Integrative Medicine, who did not work on the study. Because there is no clear definition of the term, any health care system, practice or product outside of Western medicine is generally grouped under the label of complementary and alternative medicine, or CAM. In the new study, published online in the journal Pediatrics on Monday, researchers asked more than 900 parents of children at two children's hospitals in Canada whether their children had ever used alternative medicine and, if so, how. The patients were being treated in cardiology, gastroenterology, neurology, oncology or respiratory clinics. Almost half of the parents reported that their child had used an alternative therapy at the same time that he or she was undergoing conventional medical treatment. Nearly 10 percent of parents said they'd turned to alternative medicine before seeking conventional treatment for their child's condition, and 5 percent used CAM in lieu of conventional medicine. The most popular alternative products used were vitamins and minerals, followed by herbal products and homeopathic remedies, while the most popular practices were massage, faith healing (which can include the laying on of hands or a visit to a spiritual location) chiropractic manipulation, aromatherapy and relaxation techniques. In the U.S., the most recent comprehensive information on alternative medicine use among children was published as part of a 2008 report issued by the National Institute of Health's National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. It found that nearly 40 percent of adults and 12 percent of children, or 1 in 9 kids in the U.S., have used some form of complementary medicine. Children whose parents used complementary therapies were far more likely to do so, as were teens, white children, those whose parents had more education and those with multiple health conditions. The survey also found that children whose families put off seeking out traditional medical care because of costs were more likely to try alternative medicine. Frye told The Huffington Post that to-date, most studies have focused on the prevalence of alternative medicine use rather than its potential risks and benefits.Sponsored Links Best Kept Stock Secret Emerging R&D nanotech player Nano Lab (OTCQB:CTLE) could soar 500%+ www.theAmericanSignal.net Get a Large Tax Return TaxSlayer.com will maximize your tax returns and do your taxes in no time! www.TaxSlayer.com LifeLock\u00ae Official Site Relax this vacation season & stay protected with LifeLock\u00ae protection.

It's what we call herb-drug interactions,\" said Dr. Josephine Briggs, director of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. More than half of the children in the Pediatrics study were using alternative medicine in conjunction with prescription drugs, and while the majority said they'd consulted with their doctor first, nearly 20 percent had not spoken with a doctor or pharmacist. \"The take-home message from this is that doctors should ask, and patients should tell their health care providers about the use of any dietary supplements,\" said Briggs.January 15, 2013 Posted: 01/14/2013 12:12 am EST1/15/13 Alternative Medicine Use Common In Kids With Chronic Conditions: Study www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/14/alternative-medicine-use-kids-chronic-conditions_n_2458137.html 2/2 \u00d7 people have highlighted this!

He has dedicated his career to evaluating the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of complementary and integrative medicine. In 1991 he founded the first U.S. academic medical center-based program for integrative medicine. In this interview with Dr. Daniel Redwood, Berman shares the personal journey that led to his career in integrative healthcare, explains his research at the University of Maryland on acupuncture and osteoarthritis and discusses his current work bringing acupuncture and mind-body healing methods into the university's world-renowned shock trauma center. Berman is one of the most highly funded National Institutes of Health (NIH) researchers in the area of integrative and complementary medicine, receiving over $30 million over the past 14 years. He is currently principal investigator of two NIH specialized center grants for the study of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and chronic disease, specifically arthritis and irritable bowel syndrome. These center grants build on 10 years of work from his two previous NIH center grants and a NIH international center planning grant that has built collaborations with leading institutions in Hong Kong, Australia and the United States. In 2004, Dr. Berman's landmark study showing acupuncture to be a safe and effective therapy for osteoarthritis of the knee was published as the lead article in Annals of Internal Medicine. Subsequently, it was the focus of 23 million media stories worldwide. His research publications include 3 books and over 150 articles in leading medical journals focused on integrative medicine approaches for a wide range of chronic health disorders. Health Insights Today A SERVICE OF CLEVELAND CHIROPRACTIC COLLEGE January/February 2013, Volume 6, Issue 1 \u00a9 2013 Cleveland Chiropractic College www.cleveland.edu/hit For the past 23 years, Berman has practiced integrative medicine and has introduced this approach into the University of Maryland medical system. He has also introduced core curriculum and elective courses on integrative medicine into the School of Medicine and established both research and clinical fellowships in this field. A pioneer in the field of integrative medicine, Dr. Berman was honored with the Bravewell Leadership Award for Integrative Medicine in 2005. The award \"celebrates and supports visionaries who have committed their medical careers to transforming healthcare in America and ushering in a new practice of medicine.\" He was chair of the ad hoc advisory committee to the NIH Office of Alternative Medicine when it opened in 1992, as well as the report to the NIH on alternative medicine. Subsequently, he served on their advisory committee for 6 years. Dr. Berman also helped found and now serves as field coordinator for the complementary medicine field of the Cochrane Collaboration, an international organization dedicated to evaluating all medical practices. He was a panel member of the National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine's report on complementary medicine, published in 2005, and was the first chair of the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine, which grew from 7 to 29 North American universities over his tenure. Dr. Berman is the co-founder and president of the Institute for Integrative Health, a not-for-profit organization that engages visionary scholarship and initiates innovative programs that aim to catalyze new paradigms in healthcare. How did you first become interested in alternatives to conventional medicine? I did a residency in family practice back in the late 1970s but, once out in practice, realized I didn't have a lot to offer to patients with musculoskeletal problems. I took some training in Cyriax orthopedic medicine, the diagnosis and treatment of soft tissue problems and that opened my eyes to other possibilities. I started to meditate back in 1972 when I first started medical school over in Ireland. In a way, I've always been interested in more than what the mainstream offers. When I was an undergraduate at Columbia University, I took courses with Margaret Meade in culture and anthropology and actually Health Insights Today A SERVICE OF CLEVELAND CHIROPRACTIC COLLEGE January/February 2013, Volume 6, Issue 1 \u00a9 2013 Cleveland Chiropractic College www.cleveland.edu/hit minored in anthropology while majoring in psychology. I took courses in hypnosis at the Columbia College of Surgeons when I was an undergraduate. After my medical training, it was very clear to me that I had been taught excellent skills for acute problems but didn't have enough answers for my patients who suffered from chronic disorders. I had people who I knew weren't well but all the tests were showing things were fine. I would tell them that there's nothing that shows up on the tests so maybe we can refer you to the psychiatrist. That didn't seem like enough so I started to look around and see what else was there. One thing led to another. I was running an emergency room for a couple of years over on the Eastern Shore area of the Chesapeake Bay. I remember going down to a meeting in Virginia Beach, where the owner of the different emergency rooms had their headquarters. So I'm looking at people who are 20 years older than I am who are running these emergency rooms and I'm thinking, I don't want to be like this is 20 years. [Laughter]. I said to my wife, why don't we leave the meeting and go for a walk on the beach. And so we did, and walking along I saw this sign for the ARE, the Association for Research and Enlightenment. I remembered that one of my classmates at Columbia was into Edgar Cayce, and I seemed to recall this has something to do with that. We went in there and I picked up a couple of books. One was on drugless therapies, by Harold Reilly. Yes, the physical therapist. A fine book. And I said to my wife, that's what I want to do. That began a journey. We ended up contacting the ARE clinic in Arizona, and Gladys and Bill McGarey were there and they said why don't you come out, we always like to see young physicians out here. I joined them in 1983. From there, I was really exposed to complementary and alternative medicine. They were among the founders of the American Holistic Medical Association. Magnificent people. I used to sit down with Bill twice a week and we would go over cases. I remember the first case I took, I was so proud that I had seen this woman with headaches and I hadn't given her a prescription for drugs, which is what I would have done based on my medical training. So Bill said, \"Okay what did you do?\" I said, \"Well, no prescription for drugs.\" And he said again, \"What did you do?\" He said Health Insights Today A SERVICE OF CLEVELAND CHIROPRACTIC COLLEGE January/February 2013, Volume 6, Issue 1 \u00a9 2013 Cleveland Chiropractic College www.cleveland.edu/hit I think we should call her back. And he started to teach me about lifestyle behaviors and other alternatives to the usual drug therapy. When we were out in Arizona, I had the good fortune to meet a German homeopathic doctor who was practicing in Prescott. I went up there once a week. It took me months before I realized that there was something different happening there, which was that people were starting to get better. People that had chronic diseases, from chronic hepatitis to cancer to many other problems. I had never seen that before. Healing Rather than Disease Management So you were entering for the first time the realm of actual healing rather than disease management. Absolutely. He was pretty advanced in what he did. It spurred my interest to study this further. We had the opportunity to go to Great Britain (my wife is British) when we were expecting our first child. We decided to have our child born there. When we were there, I started to look around and saw that there was a whole world of complementary medicine, as they called it back then. I began to look into it in a deeper way. When I was at the ARE Clinic in Arizona, I had also taken the UCLA acupuncture course with Joe Helms, which he was just beginning to teach at that time. I took that course with about seven other physicians. That was an eye-opener as well. It changed my way of thinking. Acupuncture seemed very natural to me to learn. I took many more courses in acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Eight Principles approach. I found that the energetic approach of homeopathy really complemented that. We planned to stay in England for a year but ended up staying for almost nine years. I took a lot of training in Europe in mind-body approaches and set up a practice in London that was an integrative practice. We had a psychiatrist who was very eclectic in his approach. I was there as a family physician who used acupuncture and homeopathy and diet. We had an osteopath and a massage therapist. It was very successful and I probably could have stayed there. I saw that I could take care of patients more effectively by incorporating more modalities and an approach [with patients] that was more of a partnership. Health Insights Today A SERVICE OF CLEVELAND CHIROPRACTIC COLLEGE January/February 2013, Volume 6, Issue 1 \u00a9 2013 Cleveland Chiropractic College www.cleveland.edu/hit How was this received by your more conventional colleagues? Many of them were looking at me like I had two heads. Basically saying, \"Why don't you come back into the fold?\" I eventually approached one of my patients, Sir Maurice Laing, in about 1990. He was a great philanthropist; he did a lot for many types of causes, including holistic medicine. I said I would like to bring this into the mainstream and he asked me to come up with a proposal. We did that and then he said that we needed to find a university to take this on. This was before there was any spotlight on the field. I approached the University of Maryland, where I had done my internship and residency. I went over in the summer of 1991 with the executive director of the Laing Foundation, Robert Harley, and we met with the head of anesthesiology since we were talking about pain. This was an area where we had a great deal of experience in our clinic. We met with the dean and the president and I remember one meeting with the head of the cancer center, Steve Schimpff, who later became head of the hospital system. He said this is interesting, this journey that you've been on, and then he asked me, \"Do you think you've got all the answers?\" I was taken aback and I said, \"No I don't but I do know that it's more enjoyable to practice this way. I can treat people more effectively, I have more options, and it's more of a partnership. But I have no idea of exactly what is working and who it works best for.\" He said, \"Good, we don't feel like we have all the answers either.\" If you're willing to travel down this road and study these therapies in a scientifically rigorous way together, I don't see why not.\" So we walked out of that meeting and the Laing Foundation executive director said, \"I don't think we need more meetings. That's good enough for us. Why don't we get started?\" And we did. The whole idea was to explore the scientific foundation and the efficacy of complementary medicine to explore the integration of conventional medicine and complementary medicine. 1991: Founding the University of Maryland's CAM Program So this was the founding of what's now called the Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Health Insights Today A SERVICE OF CLEVELAND CHIROPRACTIC COLLEGE January/February 2013, Volume 6, Issue 1 \u00a9 2013 Cleveland Chiropractic College www.cleveland.edu/hit Right. It started off as a \"project\" and later on we became a division. They never knew quite where to put us. Later we became a program, which is a whole setting in itself, kind of like a department. Then we became a center, a research center to foster collaboration with other schools and departments and institutes. And now we really have a seat at the round table, we're very much part of the culture here, we work collaboratively with people in the medical school and the dental school and the schools of pharmacy and nursing. I've even done some projects with the law school. People get it now. What have been your primary areas of research focus and what are you most proud of? We have focused on the area of pain over the years. Different types of pain\u2014osteoarthritis, musculoskeletal pain. We've worked collaboratively with the rheumatology department, with Dr. Marc Hochberg who heads that up. He's one of the top rheumatologists in the world, particularly for osteoarthritis. So that has been a main focus. Together with Marc, I published one of the first large trials in acupuncture, which showed acupuncture to be both safe and effective for knee osteoarthritis. It was published in the Annals of Internal Medicine at exactly the same time there was the whole furor over the adverse effects of Vioxx. People with arthritis were desperate, wondering what options they would now have for pain relief. So our paper generated a huge amount of interest, leading to over 20 million media stories worldwide. I'm proud of our work with the Cochrane Collaboration. It started in 1993 and we helped start the complementary medicine field within the Cochrane Collaboration in 1995. Do you know about the Cochrane Collaboration? CAM and the Cochrane Collaboration I know that it focuses on rigorous systematic reviews of existing research to determine what is effective and what isn't. That's true. They are a worldwide organization started in Oxford, England by Archie Cochrane, who was an epidemiologist. When he founded it, he said that people are unable to make decisions about their healthcare without up-to-date information, that this is true for all of medicine and that it's a real shame. Ian Chalmers (who is now Sir Ian Chalmers) picked up the ball and moved it forward. The Cochrane Collaboration is now seen by many people as the top evidence-based medicine hierarchy. I think there are now something like 25,000 people that belong to the organization, in over 100 Health Insights Today A SERVICE OF CLEVELAND CHIROPRACTIC COLLEGE January/February 2013, Volume 6, Issue 1 \u00a9 2013 Cleveland Chiropractic College www.cleveland.edu/hit countries. The idea is to gather the best evidence available, and then people in their areas of interest do systematic reviews or meta-analyses of the literature. One might be a review for a particular herb for diabetes, another for acupuncture for lower back pain. I went over to Oxford. I met with Alex Jadad and he gave me the research database he had developed, which had about 900 clinical trials at the time. We've now built it up, with many people all over the world, to where there are over 43,000 randomized controlled trials in the database along with 800 systematic reviews. Is this for the CAM database or for the whole Cochrane database? That's just for CAM. The Cochrane database has over 600,000 randomized controlled trials overall. That's as of a couple of years ago. I believe they have more RCTs in their database than the National Library of Medicine. This is a great group that doesn't care if something is CAM or conventional, just whether it's effective. Through it, we've been able to develop collaborations with top-notch people all around the world. This work is something I'm very proud of because it's brought in the conventional researchers, scientists, and clinicians to look at the therapies that help, to study them. But more importantly, it has made the evidence more readily available to people, whether you're a clinician or a researcher or a payer. We've looked through all sorts of databases to dig out the information. We're now going into the Chinese databases, the Indian databases, Japanese and more. It's a worldwide effort to gather this information that can be used to do these up-to-date reviews. The Challenge of Applying Cochrane Reviews to Patient Care As someone who has to some extent explored Cochrane reviews for subjects relevant to my own practice or areas of academic interest, it's my impression that Cochrane sets the bar very high. And that this makes it quite challenging for health professionals to apply the information in the Cochrane reviews, to translate it into actual practice. I know this is a gross generalization, but it's almost as if a Cochrane Collaboration review will never conclude that anything (CAM or conventional) is more than just slightly, marginally effective. Can you address that? Health Insights Today A SERVICE OF CLEVELAND CHIROPRACTIC COLLEGE January/February 2013, Volume 6, Issue 1 \u00a9 2013 Cleveland Chiropractic College www.cleveland.edu/hit That is so. It has a very high bar, for all of medicine. I don't think it's a bad thing to have a high bar. What it does is to say okay, here's what we know, here are the gaps, and here's what we still need to find out. It helps us in that way. What it doesn't always help with is to tell the practicing clinician what to tell the patient in front of us. Are we to tell the patient that there are some studies that say such and such, and the methodological quality may not be perfect? Clearly you have to do some interpretation. As you say, a Cochrane review is very rarely going to say that something has overwhelmingly been shown to be effective. In a sense, we can say that Cochrane reviews are building a house of evidence. You've received a substantial amount of funding from the NIH and particularly the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), with over $30 million in grants over the past 15 years. What are some of the research projects you feel have been the most meaningful and important? We have received NIH funding for our work in acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine that I mentioned earlier and also for the Cochrane work. With that we've published many trials and systematic reviews of the literature that have gone into some of the top journals. That would include the one on acupuncture for knee arthritis? Yes, we've done studies and systematic reviews in arthritis and reviews in areas like back pain; that review was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. I think those are very important along with the one on acupuncture for infertility by Eric Manheimer, who works with me here. What were the findings on acupuncture for infertility? It said that acupuncture definitely did make a difference for pregnancy rates. That was clear cut. I had a couple of female patients who had been unable to conceive, who did so after I treated them with acupuncture. But I never knew whether it was just coincidence. This leads me to think it was the acupuncture. The research is supportive. We also did a systematic review for osteoarthritis of the knee that was not as clear cut. That gets into the difference between efficacy and effectiveness research. Health Insights Today A SERVICE OF CLEVELAND CHIROPRACTIC COLLEGE January/February 2013, Volume 6, Issue 1 \u00a9 2013 Cleveland Chiropractic College www.cleveland.edu/hit Real World Research: Efficacy vs. Effectiveness For readers who may not be familiar with those terms, could you briefly explain the difference? Efficacy is the extent to which a specific intervention or treatment is beneficial under ideal conditions. In efficacy research, we narrow down the focus of who we allow into the study. So in the case of osteoarthritis and acupuncture, it might only be people between the ages of 40 and 60, and maybe it's only women or people who are not obese. Then you give the treatment under relatively ideal conditions. With effectiveness, it's a measure of the extent to which the intervention does what it's intended to do in routine care. You're not narrowing it down; you're using the treatment as it's practiced in the real world. That's a big difference. We see quite often in efficacy studies, for example some of the studies on acupuncture for osteoarthritis and back pain, differences in the effect sizes between acupuncture and sham acupuncture. Andrew Vickers' recent meta-analysis shows that. But some critics may say, ah, that's such a small difference [with true acupuncture not showing much more benefit than sham acupuncture] that it's not even meaningful. But then you look at the effectiveness studies, where it's comparing real acupuncture to usual care or to a wait list or to drugs, and there we see much larger effect sizes. So in real world settings, which are what matters most to patients, the beneficial effects are more clearly delineated. Yes. And a clinician would really say, \"That's what I'm interested in. I want to know whether I should give them that drug or acupuncture, because I'm not going to give them sham acupuncture.\" So they're going to be more interested in the effectiveness studies. In the classes I teach to chiropractic students, I emphasize that randomized controlled trials were basically developed to compare one little white pill to another little white pill. Whereas, when you look at non-substance based therapies, which is basically all of physical medicine, including not only chiropractic, acupuncture, massage therapy, and physical therapy, but also surgery, these research methods are not as easy or as applicable. And yet we try, because this is considered by many to be the \"gold standard\" for clinical research. When we compare the measured benefits of true acupuncture or spinal manipulation versus sham acupuncture or sham manipulation, and they don't look all that Health Insights Today A SERVICE OF CLEVELAND CHIROPRACTIC COLLEGE January/February 2013, Volume 6, Issue 1 \u00a9 2013 Cleveland Chiropractic College www.cleveland.edu/hit different, is it largely because this methodology sets the table in such a way that it's very difficult to show a robust response? Right, I think that's absolutely true. Now, with the whole burgeoning of comparative effectiveness research and real-life care, we have the opportunity to give the therapies the way they're actually practiced and this can even be in combination with other therapies as they are actually practiced. I mean, most of the time you don't do acupuncture on its own\u2014you do other things as well. And so the effectiveness with a group of patients, whether you're comparing it to a drug or whatever, that type of research is going to be extremely important. In addition to that, you also take into account the stakeholders' own preferences. Put those together and it becomes good evidence-based medicine. The original definition of evidence-based medicine, by David Sackett, is that it involves using the best available [research] evidence, the clinician's experience and the patient's preferences. All three of those things go into the definition of evidence-based medicine. We tend to forget about some of those parts, especially the last two. NCCAM-Funded Research Showed Benefits from Acupuncture for Arthritis How do you respond to critics of federal funding for CAM research, when they claim that none of NCCAM's grants have resulted in any positive demonstration of effectiveness for the use of CAM methods? First, I think what matters most is that we are showing that you can do rigorous science in complementary medicine. A good example of this research is our work on osteoarthritis of the knee. We did a step-wise approach to that, with NIH funding. It started with a small pilot study of 19 patients with no control group, where we showed that it was safe and effective. We used standard outcome measures [the ones used in non-CAM arthritis studies] and standard acupuncture points. There were arguments even then with the acupuncturists (this was 1992) as to whether we should use standard points [as opposed to individualized choice of points for each patient]. We said let's just show that it works. And the rheumatologists said the same thing, just show us that it works. Then, we brought in a comparison group for the next study, which had about 70 patients, with one group getting standard care and the other getting acupuncture plus standard care. When the saw the positive results, the rheumatologists said, \"That's good enough for us.\" We had shown them that Health Insights Today A SERVICE OF CLEVELAND CHIROPRACTIC COLLEGE January/February 2013, Volume 6, Issue 1 \u00a9 2013 Cleveland Chiropractic College www.cleveland.edu/hit adding acupuncture to standard care yielded a large effect size showing it was safe and effective. Standard care was not effective on its own, by the way. The NIH still wanted to see proof of efficacy, to see whether acupuncture works better than a sham control. So we then did a large 570-patient study. But by then, we had already tested the acupuncture points and the sham points. We had already done the shakedown cruise of the boat, so to speak, and we had a pretty good idea what was needed in terms of the number of treatments, the length of the treatments, the points and every aspect of it. So then when we did this larger study, we demonstrated that acupuncture was safe and effective in a large randomized trial. So this series of studies might be seen as Exhibit A for how NIH funding of research in CAM has actually shown benefits for a CAM method, in this case acupuncture. Yes, definitely. And certainly the Cochrane reviews [for which the Center for Integrative Medicine has received NCCAM/NIH funding] have shown that there are numbers of such studies. So I have to think that anyone making the claim that there have not been NIH-funded studies on CAM yielding positive results just isn't that familiar with the scientific literature. Or maybe they don't look at the literature. I've noticed that stories with those claims often appear in the Washington Post right around the time that NCCAM's budget is up for renewal. Getting back to the research itself, what we've been able to do, with acupuncture and osteoarthritis for example, is to change the nature of the research. Previously, the research was all over the place. No one was comparing apples to apples. The outcome measures weren't standardized from trial to trial in the early days. So you couldn't make good comparisons and couldn't bring it together into a meta-analysis. So we started to work with rheumatologists, who said that what they do is to look at the WOMAC [Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index] scores and other standardized methods of measuring the effects of whatever treatment is being used. We standardized the approach. At this point, we continue to look more deeply into the effectiveness and also the mechanism through which it works in the body. Health Insights Today A SERVICE OF CLEVELAND CHIROPRACTIC COLLEGE January/February 2013, Volume 6, Issue 1 \u00a9 2013 Cleveland Chiropractic College www.cleveland.edu/hit We just put in a grant proposal to NCCAM for a Center of Excellence in Research grant to look at osteoarthritis pain. If we receive the grant, we'll be looking at osteoarthritis pain, phenotyping people to see if you can predict who will get OA pain, looking at the genomics of OA pain, looking at what happens in the brain with MRI, all of that. That sounds fascinating. Then you give acupuncture and see who responds and doesn't respond, and see if we can predict how and why. For us, the future is in three directions. Certainly it's to continue the evidence-based Cochrane work, but it's also to take it more to the effectiveness side of research, and to go deeper using some of these tools like genomics and proteomics. This will be interdisciplinary research. Integrative Patient Care at the University of Maryland My understanding is that aside from your research focus at the Center for Integrative Medicine, you also provide patient care there. What kinds of practitioners are included on your team and how do they work together? We've had a clinic since we started in '91. Initially, we took the pain clinic at the University of Maryland and made it a real multidisciplinary pain center. Eventually we left there to set up our own clinic, which is still part of the university but not part of the pain center. But pain is still a key part of our focus. Pain is a key focus for CAM and integrative healthcare everywhere. So we have physicians who are practicing integrative primary care, we have a nurse who practices holistic nursing and we have several doctors of Traditional Chinese Medicine who practice herbal prescribing and acupuncture. We have taiji and qigong classes and mind-body classes with a health psychologist. We have a homeopath, massage therapist and Reiki practitioner. As to how they work, I don't think we've completely gotten that down. It's not a complete interdisciplinary working together. People refer back and forth as they get to know each other and feel more confident to refer cases out. Usually it's the physician referring to the different practitioners. It's still a work in progress. Health Insights Today A SERVICE OF CLEVELAND CHIROPRACTIC COLLEGE January/February 2013, Volume 6, Issue 1 \u00a9 2013 Cleveland Chiropractic College www.cleveland.edu/hit \"Something Truly Exciting\": Acupuncture and Mind-Body Methods at the University's Shock-Trauma Center Something truly exciting is what we're doing with the shock-trauma center here at the University of Maryland. This is one of the top such centers in the world. What they're best known for is their work on how the first hour [after major trauma] is the \"golden hour,\" the time where you will either stabilize the patient or they won't make it. People come from all over the world to train in this shock-trauma center. The man who heads it up, Tom Scalia, approached me at one of the dean's meetings and said, \"We've got a problem. We have a group of patients in this kind of acute pain who get into a hyper-inflammatory state. What do you have that could help them? Because if our methods don't work to bring the inflammation down, they're usually the ones who go into septic shock and die.\" I said to him that we do a lot with chronic pain and with wellness and prevention. I said I wasn't sure what we could do. But we started to work with them ... Acupuncture? Acupuncture first. They started to see some results and that opened up the doors and we started to bring in some mind-body approaches. We began a training program for the nurses to bring in different visualizations, to create a healing space. This included Tibetan bowls as well as Reiki healing. The results have been phenomenal for the patients, for the nurses, and for the doctors. So much so that they want more and more of it. We've trained 75 nurses now in the in-patient and shock-trauma units. We've just put forward a big proposal to the university, instigated by both Dr. Scalia and myself, saying that this has been successful and we want to systemize what we're doing here, bringing in the teaching as well as the education for patients. And that we want to do it as an integrative medicine in-patient consult service. This would be in the shock-trauma center. It's amazing. They've been so open. This is the center that did a total facial transplant that was all over the news about six weeks ago, the first ever. And the surgeons have asked for our people to be involved during the 72 hours of the surgeries, as well as the pre-op and post-op care. The fellow who had the transplant said, after he had had Reiki and acupressure for a while, \"This is the first time I'm getting relief from my pain.\" Health Insights Today A SERVICE OF CLEVELAND CHIROPRACTIC COLLEGE January/February 2013, Volume 6, Issue 1 \u00a9 2013 Cleveland Chiropractic College www.cleveland.edu/hit That is going to start to break down more doors because now the shock-trauma center says they want to do this is a larger, systematic way. And then many of their patients get discharged to the rehab hospital, Kernan Hospital, part of the University of Maryland. The head of the hospital is saying that they want to do the same thing, so that when they're discharged they have continuity of care that is the integrative approach we're doing in shock-trauma. If you talk about good continuity of patient care, along with the opportunity to research this from the acute phase all the way through, it's tremendous. Being here for 21 years, you kind of build up the trust and the relationships where we can have these discussions. Where he can say, \"What do you have?\" and I can say, \"I don't know, let's try and see,\" and over several years this can all develop. They must be seeing 20 people a day in the shock-trauma center now. The nurses are leading the way and we're going to take it further. Shock-trauma sounds like a branch of medicine, of the healing arts, that is intensely pragmatic. Yes. I mean, obviously all of the healing arts should be, and to some extent are pragmatic in terms of wanting to use what's most effective, but in shock-trauma the patient dies or the patient lives and that's a very dramatic and measurable outcome. Absolutely. And you look at the tremendous need. One of the ways that we are looking at it, kind of reframing it, is that trauma can induce growth. Or it can induce fear, where we just get stopped. There are so many types of trauma. Some of the methods we have in complementary and integrative medicine offer the potential not just for the patient to react but to take a step, a pause, and to look at things in a more positive way. Institute for Integrative Health: Thinking Big With your wife Sue Berman, you founded the Institute for Integrative Health several years ago. Tell us about it. In 2005 I was given the Bravewell Collaborative leadership award for integrative medicine. There was a cash prize of $100,000 with it and what we decided to do was to take the money and set up an Health Insights Today A SERVICE OF CLEVELAND CHIROPRACTIC COLLEGE January/February 2013, Volume 6, Issue 1 \u00a9 2013 Cleveland Chiropractic College www.cleveland.edu/hit institute outside the university, with Sue as the executive director, to complement activities that are going on in the different centers. In 1991 when we started the Center for Integrative Health, there weren't any other centers. Now there are many centers. But the same time, people don't have time to think. Everybody's so busy making things happen and surviving, that they don't really have a chance to, look at things from the 30,000 foot perspective, and think about where we are going. So the idea for the Institute was to be able to reframe the important questions in healthcare, to take a step back, to say where are we going and where we want to go. To bring people together from different disciplines to look at areas that are stuck or ripe for innovation in healthcare and to shift the dial from disease management towards health and well-being. Because even in our wonderful integrative medicine centers, we tend to focus on disease management. This is certainly valuable and important, but if we don't shift our attention and our paradigm toward health and well-being, we're just not going to get to where we want to go. The institute is set up to be a catalyst for innovation in healthcare that takes into account mind-body-spirit. We have three areas. We have a scholarship area, with Institute Scholars, kind of modeled on Howard Hughes Scholars (not with that kind of money but you never know, maybe someday). We have about eight scholars now, people who have been successful in their careers. We're saying okay, what would you want to do now to really make a difference? What would make your heart sing? Not taking the next incremental step or working on the next incremental grant, but if you had the time, what could really make a difference? And it has to be in the area of health and well-being. One of the scholars is a NASA scientist at the University of Texas who works with particles and weather, algorithms. He's working with the Walter Reed Hospital, helping them look at big data, artificial intelligence. Another scholar, David Jones, works with functional medicine, changing the paradigms of what they're teaching in schools. Another one, Bud Brainard, works with light. He said, \"I've been running my lab for 25 years and I'd almost forgotten why I'd gotten into this.\" This helps them remember. It's a chance to get back to why I went into this, to reconnect to that and then have some new experiments grow out of that. Ellen Hughes is working with healthy aging. Claudia Witt in Berlin is Health Insights Today A SERVICE OF CLEVELAND CHIROPRACTIC COLLEGE January/February 2013, Volume 6, Issue 1 \u00a9 2013 Cleveland Chiropractic College www.cleveland.edu/hit working with comparative effectiveness research. It's a wide group there. We have forums in different areas. There was one on comparative effectiveness research in integrative medicine. Another was the Affordable Care Act conference at Georgetown, where you and I met. And we just had one a couple of weeks ago at the Bosch Foundation, where we brought people together from the world of business, in mergers and acquisitions, on what makes a merger successful or not successful, and what can integrative medicine learn from this. Integrative medicine is also a merger of a kind, of different cultures coming together. We're also starting a fellowship program for young people who are at a stage in their careers where they can benefit from good mentors. The last thing I'll mention is the practical, on the ground question, \"How do we create healthy communities?\" There we're doing things that are beyond the clinic, that take into account the environment, along with good food and stress management. We're working with some of the tough high schools in Baltimore. We're working with Health Corps and adding some of our own pieces to that.

He has dedicated his career to evaluating the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of complementary and integrative medicine. In 1991 he founded the first U.S. academic medical center-based program for integrative medicine. Dr. Berman is one of the most highly funded National Institutes of Health (NIH) researchers in the area of integrative and complementary medicine, receiving over $30 million over the past 14 years. He is currently principal investigator of two NIH specialized center grants for the study of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and chronic disease, specifically arthritis and irritable bowel syndrome. These center grants build on 10 years of work from his two previous NIH center grants and a NIH international center planning grant that has built collaborations with leading institutions in Hong Kong, Australia and the U.S.. In 2004, Dr. Berman's landmark study showing acupuncture to be a safe and effective therapy for osteoarthritis of the knee was published as the lead article in Annals of Internal Medicine. Subsequently, it was the focus of 23 million media stories worldwide. His research publications include 3 books and over 150 articles in leading medical journals focused on integrative medicine approaches for a wide range of chronic health disorders. For the past 23 years, Dr. Berman has practiced integrative medicine and has introduced this approach into the University of Maryland medical system. He has also introduced core curriculum and elective courses on integrative medicine into the School of Medicine and established both research and clinical fellowships in this field. A pioneer in the field of integrative medicine, Dr. Berman was honored with the Bravewell Leadership Award for Integrative Medicine in 2005. The award \"celebrates and supports visionaries who have committed their medical careers to transforming healthcare in America and ushering in a new practice of medicine.\" He was chair of the ad hoc advisory committee to the NIH Office of Alternative Medicine when it opened in 1992, as well as the report to the NIH on alternative medicine. Subsequently, he served on their advisory committee for 6 years. Dr. Berman also helped found and now serves as field coordinator for the complementary medicine field of the Cochrane Collaboration, an international organization dedicated to evaluating all medical practices. He was a panel member of the National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine's report on complementary medicine, published in 2005, and was the first chair of the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine, which grew from 7 to 29 North American universities over his tenure.

In this interview with Dr. Daniel Redwood, Dr. Berman shares the personal journey that led to his career in integrative healthcare, explains his research at the University of Maryland on acupuncture and osteoarthritis and discusses his current work bringing acupuncture and mind-body healing methods into the university's world renowned shock trauma center. How did you first become interested in alternatives to conventional medicine? I did a residency in family practice back in the late 1970s but, once out in practice, realized I didn't have a lot to offer to patients with musculoskeletal problems. I took some training in Cyriax orthopedic medicine, the diagnosis and treatment of soft tissue problems and that opened my eyes to other possibilities. I started to meditate back in 1972 when I first started medical school over in Ireland. In a way, I've always been interested in more than what the mainstream offers. When I was an undergraduate at Columbia University, I took courses with Margaret Meade in culture and anthropology and actually minored in anthropology while majoring in psychology. I took courses in hypnosis at the Columbia College of Surgeons when I was an undergraduate. After my medical training, it was very clear to me that I had been taught excellent skills for acute problems but didn't have enough answers for my patients who suffered from chronic disorders. I had people who I knew weren't well but all the tests were showing things were fine. I would tell them that there's nothing that shows up on the tests so maybe we can refer you to the psychiatrist. That didn't seem like enough so I started to look around and see what else was there. One thing led to another. I was running an emergency room for a couple of years over on the Eastern Shore area of the Chesapeake Bay. I remember going down to a meeting in Virginia Beach, where the owner of the different emergency rooms had their headquarters. So I'm looking at people who are 20 years older than I am who are running these emergency rooms and I'm thinking, I don't want to be like this in 20 years. [Laughter]. I said to my wife, why don't we leave the meeting and go for a walk on the beach. And so we did, and walking along I saw this sign for the ARE, the Association for Research and Enlightenment. I remembered that one of my classmates at Columbia was into Edgar Cayce, and I seemed to recall this has something to do with that. We went in there and I picked up a couple of books. One was on drugless therapies, by Harold Reilly. Yes, the physical therapist. A fine book. And I said to my wife, that's what I want to do. That began a journey. We ended up contacting the ARE clinic in Arizona, and Gladys and Bill McGarey were there and they said why don't you come out, we always like to see young physicians out here. I joined them in 1983. From there, I was really exposed to complementary and alternative medicine. They were among the founders of the American Holistic Medical Association. Magnificent people. I used to sit down with Bill twice a week and we would go over cases. I remember the first case I took, I was so proud that I had seen this woman with headaches and I hadn't given her a prescription for drugs, which is what I would have done based on my medical training. So Bill said, \"Okay what did you do?\" I said, \"Well, no prescription for drugs.\" And he said again, \"What did you do?\" He said I think we should call her back. And he started to teach me about lifestyle behaviors and other3/29/13 Integrative Medicine at the University of Maryland Interview with Brian Berman, MD www.tihcij.com/Articles/Integrative-Medicine-at-the-University-of-Maryland-Interview-with-Brian-Berman-MD.aspx?id=0000382 3/12should call her back. And he started to teach me about lifestyle behaviors and other alternatives to the usual drug therapy. When we were out in Arizona, I had the good fortune to meet a German homeopathic doctor who was practicing in Prescott. I went up there once a week. It took me months before I realized that there was something different happening there, which was that people were starting to get better. People that had chronic diseases, from chronic hepatitis to cancer to many other problems. I had never seen that before. Healing Rather than Disease Management So you were entering for the first time the realm of actual healing rather than disease management. Absolutely. He was pretty advanced in what he did. It spurred my interest to study this further. We had the opportunity to go to Great Britain (my wife is British) when we were expecting our first child. We decided to have our child born there. When we were there, I started to look around and saw that there was a whole world of complementary medicine, as they called it back then. I began to look into it in a deeper way. When I was at the ARE Clinic in Arizona, I had also taken the UCLA acupuncture course with Joe Helms, which he was just beginning to teach at that time. I took that course with about seven other physicians. That was an eye-opener as well. It changed my way of thinking. Acupuncture seemed very natural to me to learn. I took many more courses in acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Eight Principles approach. I found that the energetic approach of homeopathy really complemented that. We planned to stay in England for a year but ended up staying for almost nine years. I took a lot of training in Europe in mind-body approaches and set up a practice in London that was an integrative practice. We had a psychiatrist who was very eclectic in his approach. I was there as a family physician who used acupuncture and homeopathy and diet. We had an osteopath and a massage therapist. It was very successful and I probably could have stayed there. I saw that I could take care of patients more effectively by incorporating more modalities and an approach [with patients] that was more of a partnership. How was this received by your more conventional colleagues? Many of them were looking at me like I had two heads. Basically saying, \"Why don't you come back into the fold?\" I eventually approached one of my patients, Sir Maurice Laing, in about 1990. He was a great philanthropist; he did a lot for many types of causes, including holistic medicine. I said I would like to bring this into the mainstream and he asked me to come up with a proposal. We did that and then he said that we needed to find a university to take this on. This was before there was any spotlight on the field. I approached the University of Maryland, where I had done my internship and residency. I went over in the summer of 1991 with the executive director of the Laing Foundation, Robert Harley, and we met with the head of anesthesiology since we were talking about pain. This was an area where we had a great deal of experience in our clinic. We met with the dean and the president and I remember one meeting with the head of the cancer center, Steve Schimpff, who later became head of the hospital system. He said this is interesting, this journey that you've been on, and then he asked me, \"Do you think you've got all the answers?\" I was taken aback and I said, \"No I don't but I do know that it's more enjoyable to practice this way. I can treat people more effectively, I have more options, and it's more of a partnership. But I have no idea of exactly what is working and who it works3/29/13 Integrative Medicine at the University of Maryland Interview with Brian Berman, MD www.tihcij.com/Articles/Integrative-Medicine-at-the-University-of-Maryland-Interview-with-Brian-Berman-MD.aspx?id=0000382 4/12best for.\" He said, \"Good, we don't feel like we have all the answers either.\" If you're willing to travel down this road and study these therapies in a scientifically rigorous way together, I don't see why not.\" So we walked out of that meeting and the Laing Foundation executive director said, \"I don't think we need more meetings. That's good enough for us. Why don't we get started?\" And we did. The whole idea was to explore the scientific foundation and the efficacy of complementary medicine to explore the integration of conventional medicine and complementary medicine. 1991: Founding the University of Maryland's CAM Program So this was the founding of what's now called the Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Right. It started off as a \"project\" and later on we became a division. They never knew quite where to put us. Later we became a program, which is a whole setting in itself, kind of like a department. Then we became a center, a research center to foster collaboration with other schools and departments and institutes. And now we really have a seat at the round table, we're very much part of the culture here, we work collaboratively with people in the medical school and the dental school and the schools of pharmacy and nursing. I've even done some projects with the law school. People get it now. What have been your primary areas of research focus and what are you most proud of? We have focused on the area of pain over the years. Different types of pain\u2014 osteoarthritis, musculoskeletal pain. We've worked collaboratively with the rheumatology department, with Dr. Marc Hochberg who heads that up. He's one of the top rheumatologists in the world, particularly for osteoarthritis. So that has been a main focus. Together with Marc, I published one of the first large trials in acupuncture, which showed acupuncture to be both safe and effective for knee osteoarthritis. It was published in the Annals of Internal Medicine at exactly the same time there was the whole furor over the adverse effects of Vioxx. People with arthritis were desperate, wondering what options they would now have for pain relief. So our paper generated a huge amount of interest, leading to over 20 million media stories worldwide. I'm proud of our work with the Cochrane Collaboration. It started in 1993 and we helped start the complementary medicine field within the Cochrane Collaboration in 1995. Do you know about the Cochrane Collaboration? CAM and the Cochrane Collaboration I know that it focuses on rigorous systematic reviews of existing research to determine what is effective and what isn't. That's true. They are a worldwide organization started in Oxford, England by Archie Cochrane, who was an epidemiologist. When he founded it, he said that people are unable to make decisions about their healthcare without up-to-date information, that this is true for all of medicine and that it's a real shame. Ian Chalmers (who is now Sir Ian Chalmers) picked up the ball and moved it forward. The Cochrane Collaboration is now seen by many people as the top evidence-based medicine hierarchy. I think there are now something like 25,000 people that belong to the organization, in over 100 countries. The idea is to gather the best evidence available, and then people in their areas of interest do systematic reviews or meta-analyses of the literature. One might be a review for a particular herb for diabetes, another for acupuncture for lower back pain. 3/29/13 Integrative Medicine at the University of Maryland Interview with Brian Berman, MD www.tihcij.com/Articles/Integrative-Medicine-at-the-University-of-Maryland-Interview-with-Brian-Berman-MD.aspx?id=0000382 5/12I went over to Oxford. I met with Alex Jadad and he gave me the research database he had developed, which had about 900 clinical trials at the time. We've now built it up, with many people all over the world, to where there are over 43,000 randomized controlled trials in the database along with 800 systematic reviews. Is this for the CAM database or for the whole Cochrane database? That's just for CAM. The Cochrane database has over 600,000 randomized controlled trials overall. That's as of a couple of years ago. I believe they have more RCTs in their database than the National Library of Medicine. This is a great group that doesn't care if something is CAM or conventional, just whether it's effective. Through it, we've been able to develop collaborations with top-notch people all around the world. This work is something I'm very proud of because it's brought in the conventional researchers, scientists, and clinicians to look at the therapies that help, to study them. But more importantly, it has made the evidence more readily available to people, whether you're a clinician or a researcher or a payer. We've looked through all sorts of databases to dig out the information. We're now going into the Chinese databases, the Indian databases, Japanese and more. It's a worldwide effort to gather this information that can be used to do these up-to-date reviews. The Challenge of Applying Cochrane Reviews to Patient Care As someone who has to some extent explored Cochrane reviews for subjects relevant to my own practice or areas of academic interest, it's my impression that Cochrane sets the bar very high. And that this makes it quite challenging for health professionals to apply the information in the Cochrane reviews, to translate it into actual practice. I know this is a gross generalization, but it's almost as if a Cochrane Collaboration review will never conclude that anything (CAM or conventional) is more than just slightly, marginally effective. Can you address that? That is so. It has a very high bar, for all of medicine. I don't think it's a bad thing to have a high bar. What it does is to say okay, here's what we know, here are the gaps, and here's what we still need to find out. It helps us in that way. What it doesn't always help with is to tell the practicing clinician what to tell the patient in front of us. Are we to tell the patient that there are some studies that say such and such, and the methodological quality may not be perfect? Clearly you have to do some interpretation. As you say, a Cochrane review is very rarely going to say that something has overwhelmingly been shown to be effective. In a sense, we can say that Cochrane reviews are building a house of evidence. You've received a substantial amount of funding from the NIH and particularly the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), with over $30 million in grants over the past 15 years. What are some of the research projects you feel have been the most meaningful and important? We have received NIH funding for our work in acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine that I mentioned earlier and also for the Cochrane work. With that we've published many trials and systematic reviews of the literature that have gone into some of the top journals. That would include the one on acupuncture for knee arthritis? Yes, we've done studies and systematic reviews in arthritis and reviews in areas like back pain; that review was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. I think those are very important along with the one on acupuncture for infertility by Eric Manheimer, who works with me here. What were the findings on acupuncture for infertility?3/29/13 Integrative Medicine at the University of Maryland Interview with Brian Berman, MD www.tihcij.com/Articles/Integrative-Medicine-at-the-University-of-Maryland-Interview-with-Brian-Berman-MD.aspx?id=0000382 6/12What were the findings on acupuncture for infertility? It said that acupuncture definitely did make a difference for pregnancy rates. That was clear cut. I had a couple of female patients who had been unable to conceive, who did so after I treated them with acupuncture. But I never knew whether it was just coincidence. This leads me to think it was the acupuncture. The research is supportive. We also did a systematic review for osteoarthritis of the knee that was not as clear cut. That gets into the difference between efficacy and effectiveness research. Real World Research: Efficacy vs. Effectiveness For readers who may not be familiar with those terms, could you briefly explain the difference? Efficacy is the extent to which a specific intervention or treatment is beneficial under ideal conditions. In efficacy research, we narrow down the focus of who we allow into the study. So in the case of osteoarthritis and acupuncture, it might only be people between the ages of 40 and 60, and maybe it's only women or people who are not obese. Then you give the treatment under relatively ideal conditions. With effectiveness, it's a measure of the extent to which the intervention does what it's intended to do in routine care. You're not narrowing it down; you're using the treatment as it's practiced in the real world. That's a big difference. We see quite often in efficacy studies, for example some of the studies on acupuncture for osteoarthritis and back pain, differences in the effect sizes between acupuncture and sham acupuncture. Andrew Vickers' recent meta- analysis shows that. But some critics may say, ah, that's such a small difference [with true acupuncture not showing much more benefit than sham acupuncture] that it's not even meaningful. But then you look at the effectiveness studies, where it's comparing real acupuncture to usual care or to a wait list or to drugs, and there we see much larger effect sizes. So in real world settings, which are what matters most to patients, the beneficial effects are more clearly delineated. Yes. And a clinician would really say, \"That's what I'm interested in. I want to know whether I should give them that drug or acupuncture, because I'm not going to give them sham acupuncture.\" So they're going to be more interested in the effectiveness studies. In the classes I teach to chiropractic students, I emphasize that randomized controlled trials were basically developed to compare one little white pill to another little white pill. Whereas, when you look at non-substance based therapies, which is basically all of physical medicine, including not only chiropractic, acupuncture, massage therapy, and physical therapy, but also surgery, these research methods are not as easy or as applicable. And yet we try, because this is considered by many to be the \"gold standard\" for clinical research. When we compare the measured benefits of true acupuncture or spinal manipulation versus sham acupuncture or sham manipulation, and they don't look all that different, is it largely because this methodology sets the table in such a way that it's very difficult to show a robust response? Right, I think that's absolutely true. Now, with the whole burgeoning of comparative effectiveness research and real-life care, we have the opportunity to give the therapies the way they're actually practiced and this can even be in combination with other therapies as they are actually practiced. I mean, most of the time you don't do3/29/13 Integrative Medicine at the University of Maryland Interview with Brian Berman, MD www.tihcij.com/Articles/Integrative-Medicine-at-the-University-of-Maryland-Interview-with-Brian-Berman-MD.aspx?id=0000382 7/12other therapies as they are actually practiced. I mean, most of the time you don't do acupuncture on its own\u2014you do other things as well. And so the effectiveness with a group of patients, whether you're comparing it to a drug or whatever, that type of research is going to be extremely important. In addition to that, you also take into account the stakeholders' own preferences. Put those together and it becomes good evidence-based medicine. The original definition of evidence-based medicine, by David Sackett, is that it involves using the best available [research] evidence, the clinician's experience and the patient's preferences. All three of those things go into the definition of evidence- based medicine. We tend to forget about some of those parts, especially the last two. NCCAM-Funded Research Showed Benefits from Acupuncture for Arthritis How do you respond to critics of federal funding for CAM research, when they claim that none of NCCAM's grants have resulted in any positive demonstration of effectiveness for the use of CAM methods? First, I think what matters most is that we are showing that you can do rigorous science in complementary medicine. A good example of this research is our work on osteoarthritis of the knee. We did a step-wise approach to that, with NIH funding. It started with a small pilot study of 19 patients with no control group, where we showed that it was safe and effective. We used standard outcome measures [the ones used in non-CAM arthritis studies] and standard acupuncture points. There were arguments even then with the acupuncturists (this was 1992) as to whether we should use standard points [as opposed to individualized choice of points for each patient]. We said let's just show that it works. And the rheumatologists said the same thing, just show us that it works. Then, we brought in a comparison group for the next study, which had about 70 patients, with one group getting standard care and the other getting acupuncture plus standard care. When the saw the positive results, the rheumatologists said, \"That's good enough for us.\" We had shown them that adding acupuncture to standard care yielded a large effect size showing it was safe and effective. Standard care was not effective on its own, by the way. The NIH still wanted to see proof of efficacy, to see whether acupuncture works better than a sham control. So we then did a large 570-patient study. But by then, we had already tested the acupuncture points and the sham points. We had already done the shakedown cruise of the boat, so to speak, and we had a pretty good idea what was needed in terms of the number of treatments, the length of the treatments, the points and every aspect of it. So then when we did this larger study, we demonstrated that acupuncture was safe and effective in a large randomized trial. So this series of studies might be seen as Exhibit A for how NIH funding of research in CAM has actually shown benefits for a CAM method, in this case acupuncture. Yes, definitely. And certainly the Cochrane reviews [for which the Center for Integrative Medicine has received NCCAM/NIH funding] have shown that there are numbers of such studies. So I have to think that anyone making the claim that there have not been NIH-funded studies on CAM yielding positive results just isn't that familiar with the scientific literature. Or maybe they don't look at the literature. I've noticed that stories with those claims often appear in the Washington Post right around the time that NCCAM's budget is up for renewal. Getting back to the research itself, what we've been able to do, with acupuncture and osteoarthritis for example, is to change the nature of the research. Previously, the research was all over the place. No one was comparing apples to apples. The outcome measures weren't standardized from trial to trial in the early days. So you couldn't3/29/13 Integrative Medicine at the University of Maryland Interview with Brian Berman, MD www.tihcij.com/Articles/Integrative-Medicine-at-the-University-of-Maryland-Interview-with-Brian-Berman-MD.aspx?id=0000382 8/12measures weren't standardized from trial to trial in the early days. So you couldn't make good comparisons and couldn't bring it together into a meta-analysis. So we started to work with rheumatologists, who said that what they do is to look at the WOMAC [Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index] scores and other standardized methods of measuring the effects of whatever treatment is being used. We standardized the approach. At this point, we continue to look more deeply into the effectiveness and also the mechanism through which it works in the body. We just put in a grant proposal to NCCAM for a Center of Excellence in Research grant to look at osteoarthritis pain. If we receive the grant, we'll be looking at osteoarthritis pain, phenotyping people to see if you can predict who will get OA pain, looking at the genomics of OA pain, looking at what happens in the brain with MRI, all of that. That sounds fascinating. Then you give acupuncture and see who responds and doesn't respond, and see if we can predict how and why. For us, the future is in three directions. Certainly it's to continue the evidence-based Cochrane work, but it's also to take it more to the effectiveness side of research, and to go deeper using some of these tools like genomics and proteomics. This will be interdisciplinary research. Integrative Patient Care at the University of Maryland My understanding is that aside from your research focus at the Center for Integrative Medicine, you also provide patient care there. What kinds of practitioners are included on your team and how do they work together? We've had a clinic since we started in '91. Initially, we took the pain clinic at the University of Maryland and made it a real multidisciplinary pain center. Eventually we left there to set up our own clinic, which is still part of the university but not part of the pain center. But pain is still a key part of our focus. Pain is a key focus for CAM and integrative healthcare everywhere. So we have physicians who are practicing integrative primary care, we have a nurse who practices holistic nursing and we have several doctors of Traditional Chinese Medicine who practice herbal prescribing and acupuncture. We have taiji and qigong classes and mind-body classes with a health psychologist. We have a homeopath, massage therapist and Reiki practitioner. As to how they work, I don't think we've completely gotten that down. It's not a complete interdisciplinary working together. People refer back and forth as they get to know each other and feel more confident to refer cases out. Usually it's the physician referring to the different practitioners. It's still a work in progress. \"Something Truly Exciting\": Acupuncture and Mind-Body Methods at the University's Shock-Trauma Center Something truly exciting is what we're doing with the shock-trauma center here at the University of Maryland. This is one of the top such centers in the world. What they're best known for is their work on how the first hour [after major trauma] is the \"golden hour,\" the time where you will either stabilize the patient or they won't make it. People come from all over the world to train in this shock-trauma center. The man who heads it up, Tom Scalia, approached me at one of the dean's meetings and said, \"We've got a problem. We have a group of patients in this kind of acute pain who get into a hyper-inflammatory state. What do you have that could help them? Because if our methods don't work to bring the inflammation down, they're usually the ones who go into septic shock and die.\"3/29/13 Integrative Medicine at the University of Maryland Interview with Brian Berman, MD www.tihcij.com/Articles/Integrative-Medicine-at-the-University-of-Maryland-Interview-with-Brian-Berman-MD.aspx?id=0000382 9/12I said to him that we do a lot with chronic pain and with wellness and prevention. I said I wasn't sure what we could do. But we started to work with them ... Acupuncture? Acupuncture first. They started to see some results and that opened up the doors and we started to bring in some mind-body approaches. We began a training program for the nurses to bring in different visualizations, to create a healing space. This included Tibetan bowls as well as Reiki healing. The results have been phenomenal for the patients, for the nurses, and for the doctors. So much so that they want more and more of it. We've trained 75 nurses now in the in-patient and shock-trauma units. We've just put forward a big proposal to the university, instigated by both Dr. Scalia and myself, saying that this has been successful and we want to systemize what we're doing here, bringing in the teaching as well as the education for patients. And that we want to do it as an integrative medicine in-patient consult service. This would be in the shock-trauma center. It's amazing. They've been so open. This is the center that did a total facial transplant that was all over the news about six weeks ago, the first ever. And the surgeons have asked for our people to be involved during the 72 hours of the surgeries, as well as the pre-op and post-op care. The fellow who had the transplant said, after he had had Reiki and acupressure for a while, \"This is the first time I'm getting relief from my pain.\" That is going to start to break down more doors because now the shock-trauma center says they want to do this is a larger, systematic way. And then many of their patients get discharged to the rehab hospital, Kernan Hospital, part of the University of Maryland. The head of the hospital is saying that they want to do the same thing, so that when they're discharged they have continuity of care that is the integrative approach we're doing in shock-trauma. If you talk about good continuity of patient care, along with the opportunity to research this from the acute phase all the way through, it's tremendous. Being here for 21 years, you kind of build up the trust and the relationships where we can have these discussions. Where he can say, \"What do you have?\" and I can say, \"I don't know, let's try and see,\" and over several years this can all develop. They must be seeing 20 people a day in the shock-trauma center now. The nurses are leading the way and we're going to take it further. Shock-trauma sounds like a branch of medicine, of the healing arts, that is intensely pragmatic. Yes. I mean, obviously all of the healing arts should be, and to some extent are pragmatic in terms of wanting to use what's most effective, but in shock-trauma the patient dies or the patient lives and that's a very dramatic and measurable outcome. Absolutely. And you look at the tremendous need. One of the ways that we are looking at it, kind of reframing it, is that trauma can induce growth. Or it can induce fear, where we just get stopped. There are so many types of trauma. Some of the methods we have in complementary and integrative medicine offer the potential not just for the patient to react but to take a step, a pause, and to look at things in a more positive way. Institute for Integrative Health: Thinking Big With your wife Sue Berman, you founded the Institute for Integrative Health several3/29/13 Integrative Medicine at the University of Maryland Interview with Brian Berman, MD www.tihcij.com/Articles/Integrative-Medicine-at-the-University-of-Maryland-Interview-with-Brian-Berman-MD.aspx?id=0000382 10/12With your wife Sue Berman, you founded the Institute for Integrative Health several years ago. Tell us about it. In 2005 I was given the Bravewell Collaborative leadership award for integrative medicine. There was a cash prize of $100,000 with it and what we decided to do was to take the money and set up an institute outside the university, with Sue as the executive director, to complement activities that are going on in the different centers. In 1991 when we started the Center for Integrative Health, there weren't any other centers. Now there are many centers. But the same time, people don't have time to think. Everybody's so busy making things happen and surviving, that they don't really have a chance to, look at things from the 30,000 foot perspective, and think about where we are going. So the idea for the Institute was to be able to reframe the important questions in healthcare, to take a step back, to say where are we going and where we want to go. To bring people together from different disciplines to look at areas that are stuck or ripe for innovation in healthcare and to shift the dial from disease management towards health and well-being. Because even in our wonderful integrative medicine centers, we tend to focus on disease management. This is certainly valuable and important, but if we don't shift our attention and our paradigm toward health and well-being, we're just not going to get to where we want to go. The institute is set up to be a catalyst for innovation in healthcare that takes into account mind-body-spirit. We have three areas. We have a scholarship area, with Institute Scholars, kind of modeled on Howard Hughes Scholars (not with that kind of money but you never know, maybe someday). We have about eight scholars now, people who have been successful in their careers. We're saying okay, what would you want to do now to really make a difference? What would make your heart sing? Not taking the next incremental step or working on the next incremental grant, but if you had the time, what could really make a difference? And it has to be in the area of health and well-being. One of the scholars is a NASA scientist at the University of Texas who works with particles and weather, algorithms. He's working with the Walter Reed Hospital, helping them look at big data, artificial intelligence. Another scholar, David Jones, works with functional medicine, changing the paradigms of what they're teaching in schools. Another one, Bud Brainard, works with light. He said, \"I've been running my lab for 25 years and I'd almost forgotten why I'd gotten into this.\" This helps them remember. It's a chance to get back to why I went into this, to reconnect to that and then have some new experiments grow out of that. Ellen Hughes is working with healthy aging. Claudia Witt in Berlin is working with comparative effectiveness research. It's a wide group there. We have forums in different areas. There was one on comparative effectiveness research in integrative medicine. Another was the Affordable Care Act conference at Georgetown, where you and I met. And we just had one a couple of weeks ago at the Bosch Foundation, where we brought people together from the world of business, in mergers and acquisitions, on what makes a merger successful or not successful, and what can integrative medicine learn from this. Integrative medicine is also a merger of a kind, of different cultures coming together. We're also starting a fellowship program for young people who are at a stage in their careers where they can benefit from good mentors. The last thing I'll mention is the practical, on the ground question, \"How do we create healthy communities?\" There we're doing things that are beyond the clinic, that take into account the environment, along with good food and stress management. We're working with some of the tough high schools in Baltimore. We're working with Health Corps and adding some of our own pieces to that.

New studies by U.S. researchers are revealing the potential healing power of acupuncture, Tai Chi exercise and Qigong to reduce the symptoms of osteoarthritis, the most common form of arthritis, which causes pain and reduced motion in the joints and spine. Experts say there is no current medicinal cure for osteoarthritis. In a 2009 study published in Arthritis Care & Research, Dr. Chenchen Wang and colleagues at Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, recruited 40 subjects averaging 65 years of age suffering from knee osteoarthritis to participate in a 60 minute Tai Chi session, instructed by a Tai Chi master, twice weekly for 12 weeks. Tai Chi is a traditional Chinese mind-body exercise that enhances balance, strength and flexibility, and reduces pain, depression and anxiety in diverse patient populations with chronic conditions. \"It's very exciting,\" says Wang, who says the study showed that Tai Chi appeared to improve physical function and reduce pain and depression. \"We found that Tai Chi does have a lot of benefits for the elderly for physical and mental conditions.\" In June 2008, Dr. Kevin Chen and fellow researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine Center for Integrative Medicine, Baltimore, published a study in Clinical Rheumatology revealing the effectiveness of external Qigong ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISE WITH US Splashdown Grand Opening of Junkyard Dawg Pool Day Farewell to Farm 255 Sunflowers!

External Qigong therapy is similar to therapeutic touch, in which the well-trained healer applies his/her Qi energy to the patient, Chen says. Chinese medicine considers knee arthritis to be caused by Qi blockage in the knee area. Among the three groups treated for two weeks, Chen says \"the placebo group had a 33 percent reduction in pain, the group by Healer 1 had a 35 percent reduction in pain, while the group by Healer 2 had a 55 percent reduction of pain after two weeks of treatment.\" This led Chen to conclude that External QiGong Therapy might have a role in the treatment of osteoarthritis, depending upon the qualities of the healer. Chinese acupuncture also has been studied to aid in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. Dr. Lixing Lao of the Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine has conducted three acupuncture studies from 1993 to 2004, from a small pilot study to a 570 patient clinical trail. \"Patients who were randomly assigned to the acupuncture treatment group had significant pain relief and function improvement as compared to placebo/sham control,\" Lao says. Researchers realize more studies need to be done to incorporate Chinese exercise and healing practices into mainstream medicine in the U.S. But they are seeing hopeful signs. \"Acupuncture is more accepted by the public than any time before,\" Lao says, citing a recently published survey conducted by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). \"There were 27.2 visits to acupuncturists per year per 1000 persons in 1997, but in 2007, this number increased to 79.2 visits per year per 1000 persons.\" Plus, Lao says, more medical acupuncturists are working in hospitals. \"For example, in our University of Maryland School of Medicine, not only is acupuncture service provided by licensed acupuncturists in the center for integrative medicine, but also by medical acupuncturists for their patients in the shock trauma center, cancer center and anesthesiology department.\" \u00a9 CTW Features1k Woman who fell from Texas roller coaster identified 1k It's a boy!

The drugs inhibit the production of aromatase, an enzyme that plays a key role in the biosynthesis of estrogen. \"Dr. Brodie's pioneering research, which has spanned more than 30 years, has saved the lives of thousands of women worldwide,\" said Kevin J. Cullen, MD, the Marlene & stewart greenebaum Distinguished Professor in Oncology at the University of Maryland school of Medicine and Director of the University of Maryland Marlene and stewart greenebaum Cancer Center. \"The development of this class of drugs is arguably one of the most important therapeutic advances in treating women with breast cancer in the last quarter century.\" e. albert Reece, MD, PhD, MBa, Vice President for Medical affairs, University of Maryland, and the John Z. and akiko K.

Dr. Brodie richly deserves this honor. We are most fortunate to have her as an esteemed member of our faculty.\"angela H.

Writing for Wellness: A Source of Renewal and a Path for Healing Kevin J. Cullen, MD, has been named the first Marlene and stewart greenebaum Distinguished Professor in Oncology at the University of Maryland school of Medicine. The March 5 ceremony presenting this honor also honored the greenebaum family for their extraordinary generosity in supporting the world-class oncology research and treatment program at the University of Maryland Mar - lene and stewart greenebaum Cancer Center, which Dr. Cullen directs. The greenebaums, owners of a real estate and development company, are longtime benefactors of the Uni-versity of Maryland Medical Center, which named its cancer center in their honor in the 1990s. \"On behalf of the greenebaum family, I would like to thank everyone who has been involved in honoring our family,\" says Michael greenebaum. \"We are very grateful to be a part of these great institutions. Under great leadership, we have watched them flourish and, more importantly, save lives. There is no bigger honor than to know that together we have made a difference. We are so pleased that Dr. Cullen is receiving the Marlene & stewart greenebaum Distinguished Professorship in Oncology. It is an honor to bestow him with this endowed professorship and to know that Dr. Cullen will be saving lives and spearheading groundbreaking research for years in the fight against cancer.\" The greenebaum Distinguished Professorship is the culmination of the family's long history of affiliation with the University of Maryland. In the 1960s, doctors at the then-University Hospital successfully and compassion-ately treated stewart greenebaum's father for a life-threatening condition. The lifesaving care sowed the seeds for stewart and Marlene greenebaum's long-running support of the institution. Their commitments to the University of Maryland are extensive and diverse. In 1996, the greenebaums made a $10 million gift to the University of Maryland school of Medicine and its partner University of Maryland Medical system. It was the largest private contribution ever made to the school or the hospital, and was made in recognition of \"extraordinary growth and progress.\" The gift came five years after Marlene greenebaum's diagnosis of cancer, and it celebrated her successful treatment and recovery. In honor of the gift, the cancer center was named after the greenebaums. DR. KeVIn CUllen named First greenebaum Distinguished Professor in Oncology [please turn to back page] HHolocaust survivor and psychiatrist Viktor Frankl believed that \"suffering ceases to be suffering...at the moment it finds a meaning.\" There are many things in life that cause suffering\u2014trauma, illness, loss. These difficult life events affect your body, mind, and spirit, not to mention your relationships, job, and priorities. some people seem to be able to not only move through the suffering, but also to experience growth and strengthening that give purpose to the pain. How do they do it? and, better yet, how can you do it? One effective way is writing. Writing is a tool that can help us move through suffering by first exploring it, helping us to let go of painful emotions and memories. Through writing, we can search for meaning and explore new identities and pathways to wholeness. Putting difficult life events into words allows us to create a narrative. The shaping and reshaping of this narrative can be a deeply healing practice for many. Writing is a great way to relieve stress and better your health, studies have shown. numerous research studies have shown that those who journal or write have better overall physical health, fewer doctor's visits, improved sleep, less pain, increased positive mood, stronger immune systems, lower blood pressure and heart rates, and lower stress-hormone levels. Those who wrote about emotional topics received better grades, found jobs more quickly, and were absent from work less often compared to those who wrote about superficial topics or just about the facts of the crisis. This make s sense, because when we suppress our emotions we intensify the experience of pain, setting ourselves up for illness and a difficult recovery. For many, the lasting improvement in well-being far outweighs any temporary distress from writing about painful topics. In the four-session Writing for Wellness workshops held on the UMB campus, participants are led on a healing journey to search for meaning and find their best selves through the simple act of journaling or writing, sometimes called narrative Medicine. In addition to writing, participants are inspired by reading and discussing selected pieces of literature, such as poems and short stories. These passages are selected to enrich the writers' understanding of their own illnesses, traumas, and/or life concerns and to provide new perspectives for their recoveries and healing. each week, after discussing the reading, one or two writing prompts are provided to direct participants' writing, based on the theme of the session. Writing for Wellness workshops are offered each month. These workshops are ideal for anyone who would like to confidentially process dif- ficult and stressful life events (your writing will never be read), improve health, and achieve a greater overall sense of well-bein g. all are welcome and no writing experience is necessary.

Order a reprint of this article now ACHES & CLAIMS June 24, 2013, 6:15 p.m. ET Aculief Aculief's $30 clip applies constant pressure to the hegu spot.By LAURA JOHANNES The Claim: Applying pressure to a dime-sized spot located between the thumb and forefinger can calm anxiety and pain, particularly headaches and dental pain. Acupuncturists treat this spot, called hegu, with needles, but a small device can put pressure on it as well. The Verdict: Of the more than 300 Chinese acupuncture points, hegu in clinical practice seems to be one of the most useful\u2014particularly for pain relief, doctors say. Hegu hasn't been sufficiently studied to prove conclusively it alleviates pain, but one well-designed study found it blunted the worst pain experienced during a medical procedure. It isn't known exactly how hegu works, says John C. Reed, director of inpatient services at the Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore. A recent human study found treating it with acupuncture needles increases blood flow to the face, an area where acupuncturists say it is likely to relieve pain. Other research suggests hegu may work by stimulating endorphins, proteins that are natural pain relievers, he adds. A 2011 study by researchers at the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, examined the effect of pressing on the hegu point in cancer patients undergoing a procedure called bone-marrow aspiration, which can cause excruciating pain. The study found no difference in average pain levels in patients treated with pressure applied with a device on the hegu point to the same amount of pressure on a point a couple inches away on the top of the hand, which has no known benefit. But it did find that the proportion of patients with severe pain decreased in the hegu group. That suggests that hegu, pronounced her-goo in Mandarin Chinese, \"takes the edge\" off the worst pain, says study author Ting Bao, an oncologist and medical acupuncturist at the University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center in Baltimore. Hegu is generally used by acupuncturists as part of a customized program that includes a variety of other acupuncture points, says Meredith St. John, academic dean of the New England School of Acupuncture, in Dow Jones Reprints: This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only.

For example, the points to treat a patient for anxiety would be different than those for treating someone with menstrual pain\u2014but hegu would likely be a common denominator in both treatments, she adds. Aculief Inc. of Carlsbad, Calif., sells a $30 clip that applies constant pressure to the spot. The company says it hasn't done any studies on the clip, but that its customers say it helps headaches and other pain. To manipulate your own hegu point, acupuncturists say to put a thumb on top of the fleshy part between the thumb and forefinger of the opposite hand. Place your forefinger on the other side of the hand and press hard. If you're doing it right, it will hurt, Dr. Bao adds. A minute or two may be enough, or you may need to try for longer\u2014but benefits will start to decrease after about 20 to 40 minutes of steady pressure, Dr. Reed says. If you get no relief from pressing one hand, try the other one, acupuncturists add. Pressing on hegu is generally safe, however, acupuncturists say pregnant women should avoid it. Traditional Chinese medicine texts say manipulating the point can induce labor. \u2014Email aches@wsj.com A version of this article appeared June 25, 2013, on page D3 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: Can You Relieve Pain With A Squeeze to the Hand?.Appendix C: Print & Electronic Materials www.mdh2e.org Questions or comments, please contact: Joan Plisko, Technical Director, 410 -706-2107, plisko@son.umaryland.edu for environmental health\" Anne Arundel Medical Center's Sustainability Coordinator, Charlotte Wallace, was featured in the May issue of ADVANCE for nurses magazine.

And\u2014recycling rates have gone up from 1% to 24%. Congratulations to Charlotte on an inspiring profile! \"I've always struggled with the paradox of working in an area that promotes wellness and saves lives yet is so negligent with simple steps that can help prevent some of the diseases and social issues we treat,\" she wrote. \"Isn't it ironic that we treat cancer victims, yet we treat them in a building that is built and run with materials linked to cancer?\" Wallace explained how patients had repeatedly asked where to recycle bottles and cans, and that she had no answer for them. Others wondered aloud why the hospital still used nonbiodegradable Styrofoam. Again, she lacked any satisfactory response. \"As a nurse, I believe in science,\" she continued, \"and there is undeniable scientific evidence that connects global warming to catastrophic disasters and diseases all around the world.\" Nursing facility farmers' market grand opening Genesis Hammonds Lane Center in Brooklyn, MD, held the grand opening of its farmers' market last Friday.

Following breakfast and a business meeting, the group, including representatives from across Maryland's healthcare facilities, listened to presentations from peers. First, Katie Huffling, RN, MS, CNM, director of programs for the Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments (ANHE), spoke on occupational health and healthcare. Katie told the group that those with high rates of exposure to harsh cleaning chemicals has 47% higher rates of asthma than those that don't. Anne Van Waes, director of quality and patient safety at Anne Arundel Medical Center, spoke about her hospital's experience and success using ultraviolet technology to disinfect hospital rooms. Anne mentioned that only 48% of high risk surfaces in hospitals (like bedrails) are cleaned appropriately.

In the early days, sustainability in health care wasn't easy \u2014 it required substantial investment and lacked the visibility provided by other initiatives within the hospital. Thanks, in part, to organizations like Practice Greenhealth and the dedication of forward -thinking health systems and suppliers, there has been a dramatic shift in attitudes toward economic and environmental stewardship. Today, health care sustainability is a top priority for most leading hospitals and health systems. Many of the initiatives being pursued, including reprocessing, are helping providers contain costs. As one illustration of the industry's progress, this year's CleanMed Conference had record attendance with very high C -level participation. This tells me hospital leaders are realizing that environmental initiatives can help \"bend\" the cost curve.

Even subconsciously, most children find themselves using a form of art to sooth themselves or satisfy an unmet need - who didn't decorate the pages of a textbook, draw a picture of their favorite (or least favorite) teacher, or create and then destroy a clay sculpture or lego tower? Even now, many adults I know make little doodles in the margins of their notebooks, file folders, and Post-It notes. Why do we do this? Simply put, because we need to! \"Art has the potential to change lives and in profound ways. When words are not enough, we turn to images and symbols to tell our stories. And in telling our stories through art, we can find a path to health and wellness, emotional reparation, recovery, and ultimately, transformation,\" says the International Art Therapy Organization [IATO] (www.internationalarttherapy.org). Even something as simple as doodling is considered art and a form of \"artistic self-expression.\" According to the American Art Therapy Association (www.americanarttherapyassociation.org), \"the creative process involved in artistic self-expression helps people resolve conflicts and problems, develop interpersonal skills, reduce stress, and increase self-esteem and self-awareness.\" What are some easy, inexpensive, and time-sensitive ways that you can use art in your daily life to help find the path to health and wellness? 1) Doodle: Sketch pictures that describe your mood, your feelings, or anything else that your hand and brain want you to create. 2) Scribble: Create abstract pictures that are representative of your moods, feelings, or state-of-mind. 3) Paint (watercolor, finger paints, and acrylics tend to be the easiest to use and clean up): Use colors as your means of artistic communication - abstract patterns and still-life works are equally helpful. 4) Stamp: Colorful inkpads and fun shaped stamps can help those with less confidence in their FOLLOW BY EMAIL Email address...

For those of you who don't want to waste the paper or buy supplies, there are numerous \"apps\" for smartphones and tablets, as well as for the computer, that allow you to doodle, color, paint, stamp, and more. One last note: these works of art are for YOU. No one else has to see them. Some people keep them as a visual diary, others throw them out or recycle them, some paint over them, and some re-use them. It's your art, your self-expression, a piece of you. Lose your stress and find yourself. *********************** Need some inspiration or a place to start?

Healthy and delicious, three of the main ingredients of this recipe - spinach, strawberries, and walnuts - are extremely nutrient dense and all contain anti-inflammatory properties. For example: Spinach contains health-supportive nutrients called \"glycoglycerolipids\" that helps protect the lining of the digestive tract from damage, especially damage related to unwanted inflammation. Because of their amazing combination of phytonutrients, including anthocyanins, ellagitannins, flavonols, terpenoids, and phenolic acids, strawberries have potential anti-inflammatory properties, and recent research has shown that the regular consumption of strawberries can decrease chronic inflammation. Walnuts contain many phytonutrients, including tannin tellimagrandin and flavonol morin, which are rare and valuable as antioxidants and anti-inflammatory nutrients. Dr. Chris D'Adamo, Assistant Professor and nutrition expert at the Center for Integrative Medicine, adds that you should try to buy organic versions of these ingredients to cut down on pesticide consumption for an even healthier meal.

Remove the tick if you can following the instructions below: a. Use fine tweezers to grasp the tick as close to the skin surface as possible. b. Pull backwards gently but firmly, using an even, steady pressure. Do not jerk or twist. c. After removing the tick, wash the skin and hands thoroughly with soap and water. 2. You do not need to keep the tick. Please note the following: a. Its color and size b. If it was attached to your skin or just resting on your skin c. If it was big, round, and full of blood. 3. You do not need to be tested for Lyme disease at this time. Even people who become infected will not have a positive blood test until approximately two to six weeks after the tick bite. 4. If the tick was not attached, easy to remove or just walking on the skin, and was still flat, tiny and not engorged with blood or not attached for 24 to 36 hours when it was removed it could not have transmitted infection. In this case you do NOT need to be treated. 5. You may need to be treated if the following are true: a. The attached tick looks like an adult or nymphal blacklegged (I. scapularis) deer tick.

If it is due to muscular irregularities, you can try these easy self-massage techniques - all done with a tennis ball! Using a wall is the easiest and most convenient way to use a tennis ball to massage your back. Lean in to it gently and roll around until you find your tight areas.

This would be the same positioning as the wall and chair, only horizontal instead of vertical. The most important thing to remember is listen to your body. Press in when it feels good and lighten up if it hurts. If you are not sure, ask your local massage therapist or your doctor. Our Acupressure class (click here or the link to the right) will teach you additional variations ofThe ball can go anywhere on your back - EXCEPT your spine. Alternative placement: Place the ball between you and a firm-backed chair. Again, move the ball around anywhere on your back, avoiding the spine. No chair or wall? Try placing the ball in a sock and pulling it around on your back using both hands. This is a little more difficult than the chair or the wall, but still feels really good. 7/3/13 University of Maryland Center for Integrative Medicine: Easy Self-Massage Tricks for Upper Back Pain um-cim.blogspot.com/2012/07/easy-self-massage-tricks-for-upper-back.html 3/3Newer Post Older Post HomePosted by University of Maryland Center for Integrative Medicine at 11:38 AM techniques for all over pain relief that can be used on yourself and on others.

ExPE ri E nc Center for Integrative medicineun iversity of mar yland School of m edicine conferenceHealth Wellness The University of Maryland Center for Integrative Medicine is committed to evaluating the scientific foundation of integrative medicine, educating health professionals and the public, and integrating evidence-based complementary therapies into clinical care. Founded in 1991, the Center was the first of its kind in a US academic health center. As a National Institutes of Health Center of Excellence for 15 years and the coordinating center for the international Cochrane Collaboration Complementary Medicine Field, we are a leader in producing scientific evidence in integrative medicine. Our findings have been published in leading peer-reviewed journals and have inspired further research and new clinical models of care. Meditation, herbs, and acupuncture are now used much more widely to help relieve the suffering of people with acute and chronic conditions, such as depression, pain, and trauma. The Annals of Internal Medicine published our landmark study on the safety and effectiveness of acupuncture for treating osteoarthritis. This research brought many individuals hope of new treatment options that would alleviate their pain and improve their quality of life, without fear of adverse side effects. At the University of Maryland we are redefining what it means to practice medicine, preparing our students to be both scientists and healers. Along with state-of-the-art medical training, we encourage our students to develop their own self-awareness and empathetic communication skills. This combination is transforming medicine from the inside out. Our overarching goal is to help people maintain optimal health and wellness by emphasizing an approach to healing that values mind, body, and spirit. We honor a person's innate capacity to heal, providing our patients with choices and empowering their self-care. Each and every gift makes a difference by helping the Center to achieve our research, educational, clinical, and cross-cultural collaborative priorities. To make a gift to support the Center, please call 1 (877) FUND-SOM or donate online at compmed.umm.edu/support.asp.about how to donateDear SPONSORS and PARTICIPANTS, Welcome to the Center for Integrative Medicine's second annual Health & Wellness Conference!The success of our 2012 conference and the excellent feedback from our attendees and generous sponsors spurred us on to organize this second conference and we hope that you enjoy this day as much as we enjoyed planning it! I would like to take this opportunity to thank our sponsors for their support, without which this day would not have been possible, and our speakers, who bring perspectives on health from a broad range of disciplines. Our planning and advisory committees have also spanned a broad range of professions, and I extend my heartfelt thanks to them and to all the volunteers who helped to organize this event. Finally, and most importantly, thank you to all of our participants. It is for you that we hold this conference and we hope that you \"explore, experience, and engage\" in a superior day of learning. At the Center for Integrative Medicine we are committed to helping our patients, colleagues, medical students, and other professionals to optimize their own health and the lives of those with whom they work. We are always looking for new ways to expand these opportunities. Since last year's conference, some of our new programs include: Interactive Wellness Workshops in acupressure, yoga, art, and meditation Corporate Wellness programs which were featured in the Baltimore Business Journal An expanded, comprehensive integrative care program at the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center and at Kernan Orthopedics and Rehabilitation Hospital Innovative research projects on topics such as an integrative treatment for chronic Lyme Disease, healthy eating for obesity prevention, acupuncture for spinal cord injury, and mind-body therapies for stress management Looking over the program for today's event, I am filled with excitement as to what vital things might result from this gathering of like-minded, health-conscious individuals. This conference is another step that will put the \"we\" back in wellness!

This class incorporates movement. Central Sensitization Syndrome: Pointing Us Toward a New Paradigm for Understanding and T reating Chronic Pain and Depression Gary Kaplan, D.O., F.A.C.P., F.A.C.M.P.E., F.A.C.P.E. The co-morbidity of chronic pain and neuropsychiatric disorders is common, causing neurodysregulation and neurodegeneration in the central nervous system. The underlying pathophysiology of these conditions is central sensitization. Central Sensitization Syndrome (CSS) is a complex, neuroimmunologically-mediated condition. At the cellular level, the fundamental mediator of CSS is the microglia. What we are learning about the pathophysiology of CSS enables us to formulate a new paradigm for understanding how a variety of seemingly unrelated illnesses and traumas can result in CSS. Pain expert Dr. Gary Kaplan will explore how CSS has multiple, reinforcing etiologies that require us to consider the possibility that this condition is an evolutionary process within an individual and not simply the consequence of having contracted a unique disease or suffered a single traumatic event. He will also discuss the importance of comprehensive and integrated treatment protocols. Social Ecosystems and Chronic Disease: Are the Social Threads That Connect Us As Important As the Genetic Threads? Mark Hyman, M.D. We are in the midst of an epidemic of chronic disease that threatens the health of our people and the economic well-being of our nation. Dr. Hyman will discuss how our social ecosystem can cause chronic illness. He will help practitioners and patients recognize, manage, and prevent the interconnected web of dysfunction that is at the foundation of chronic disease. Today's dominant system of medicine is based on an acute-care model, instead of addressing the chronic underlying causes of illness and diseases such as heart disease, high blood pressure, many cancers, stroke, and even dementia. Dr. Hyman uses the term \"diabesity\" in his most recent book, The Blood Sugar Solution, to characterize the root problem that links all of these diseases. Dr. Hyman also provides provocative insight on how chronic disease is very often a SOCIAL disease and not just a problem of biology. He will explore how the genetic threads that connect us may be less important than the social threads \u2014 that our social connections and our ancient need to be part of a tribe may be a way out of our epidemic of chronic disease ... Community must be part of the medicine, part of the cure. Change Your Brain, Change Your Pain Brian Morrison, D.C. Dr. Janet Travell said, \"After an injury, tissues heal, but muscles learn.
