She gives simple ways to incorporate Ayurveda into your lifestyle and makes it easy to understand and relate. As a certified yoga instructor, I'm always looking to grow my knowledge in the realm of a holistic lifestyle. LLB Thank you Angela for the work you do. It has played a role in furthering my knowledge of Ayurveda as I continue to incorporate it into my life. Today and last month's episodes have been especially meaningful to me. I appreciate your real-ness and vulnerability. Love and light. So thankful for this podcast I discovered simple Ayurveda with Angela quite a few years ago. I have learned to add peace into my life through the ancient practices that are taught here. I feel that balance is one of the key components of this podcast. I have shared this with so many of my friends. It has been wonderful and inspiring to see the growth. "}
