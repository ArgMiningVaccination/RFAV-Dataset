We are interested in the impact of mood and anxiety disorders on cardiac health, and how different treatments for these disorders may impact quality of life and function. Depression and anxiety have been identified as risk factors for poor cardiac outcomes and death, independent of traditional cardiac risk factors such as high blood pressure, smoking or diabetes. Unfortunately, depression and anxiety go unrecognized and untreated in the vast majority of patients with heart disease, despite the existence of safe and effective treatment. We have performed two randomized trials of care management for cardiac patients who have depression or anxiety disorders to determine whether having a care manager helps these patients to have better outcomes and better quality of life, and have examined the impact of psychiatric medications on cardiac health. Also, we are increasingly interested in the role of positive thoughts and emotions in health. There is some suggestion that positive psychological states, like optimism, positive affect and self-efficacy in persons may independently predict superior health, yet these connections have not been closely studied in patients who have chronic or acute illnesses, like an acute coronary syndrome or type 2 diabetes. We have adapted positive psychological exercises to this population to determine if such exercises can boost optimism, positive affect, and self-efficacy in persons with heart disease or type 2 diabetes. We are performing ongoing studies to better develop these exercises and to determine whether they may affect biology, health behaviors, and key cardiac outcomes. We are also working to adapt these positive psychological interventions to patients with other medical populations, such as those with metabolic syndrome or in post-bariatric surgery patients. Finally, we are exploring the use of text-messaging intervention (TMI) in patients with medical illnesses (e.g. cardiac condition, type-2-diabetes). We have developed a TMI that utilizes an adaptive algorithm to deliver messages related to positive psychology (PP) activities (e.g. recalling positive events) that promote psychological well-being and health behavior text messages (e.g. having a heart-healthy diet). We are continuously refining the algorithm and performing ongoing studies to examine the impact of text-message intervention on health behavior adherence and psychological and medical outcomes. Active Research Projects Total Health Pragmatic collaborative care for cardiac inpatients with depression or anxiety National Institutes of Health: National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (1R01HL133149) This is a randomized controlled trial aiming to determine whether a blended, collaborative care intervention for heart disease and mood or anxiety disorders (the Total Health program) leads to improvements in quality of life and other patient outcomes during and after treatment. Principal Investigator (PI): Jeff Huffman Reach for Health: Researching Emotions and Cardiac Health A Novel Behavioral Intervention to Promote Adherence in Heart Failure National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (1R01HL155301) This is a randomized trial to examine the efficacy of a 12-week, phone-delivered, combined positive psychology-motivational interviewing intervention (\"Reach for Health\") to promote health behavior adherence in patients with heart failure. The Reach for Health program will be compared to a motivational interviewing-based control condition, and the primary outcome will be a measure consisting of physical activity, sodium excretion, and medication adherence.

Principal Investigator (PI): Hermioni Lokko Amonoo Developing a Positive Psychology Intervention to Promote Health Behaviors in Metabolic Syndrome (MAPP) Development of a motivational interviewing-positive psychology intervention to improve mood and health related quality of life in patients with metabolic syndrome National Institutes of Health (5K23HL135277) The goal of this randomized controlled trial project is to identify insufficiently active primary care patients with metabolic syndrome and help them increase their physical activity through a group multilevel behavioral intervention. This project aims to test a combined positive psychology and motivational interviewing intervention in a group-setting at various community clinics and examine the intervention's impact on psychological, behavioral, and health outcomes in patients with metabolic syndrome. Principal Investigator (PI): Rachel Millstein A Text Message Intervention to Promote Health Behaviors in Cardiac Risk Conditions (Text4Health) An adaptive text message intervention program to promote well-being and physical activity in adults with cardiac risk conditions NIH-NINR National Institute of Nursing Research (1R21NR018738) This is a pilot two-arm project delivering text messages related to positive psychology (PP) activities and health behavior text messages (e.g. having a heart-healthy diet, becoming more physically active) in patients with cardiac risk conditions (i.e. hyperlipidemia, hypertension, type-2-diabetes). The project aims to use an adaptive algorithm that selects messages based on individual participant ratings, delivering an increasingly tailored set of text messages over time. We hope to test its feasibility and acceptability, and explore between-group differences on psychological, behavioral, and health-related outcomes in our participants. Principal Investigator (PI): Jeff Huffman Gaining Optimism After Weight Loss Surgery (GOALS) II Randomized Controlled Trial of a Positive Psychology-based Intervention to Increase Physical Activity After Bariatric Surgery National Institutes of Health: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (K23HL148017) This study aims to increase physical activity and psychological well-being in adults who have recently had bariatric surgery. We adapted a positive psychology-motivational interviewing telephone counseling intervention for the needs of this population via qualitative interviews and a proof-of-concept study. The intervention is now being tested in a pilot randomized controlled trial to examine feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy on physical activity, positive affect, and other outcomes in adults who recently had bariatric surgery.Principal Investigator (PI): Emily Feig Well-being in IBS: Strengths and Happiness (WISH) Development of a positive psychology intervention to improve mood and health-related quality of life in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) Dupont Warren and Livingston Awards This project aims to adapt a positive psychology intervention for patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
