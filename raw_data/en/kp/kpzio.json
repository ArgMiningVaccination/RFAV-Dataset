Provide a rotational framework to ensure a high level of competency in all areas of Family Medicine, but still allow for an individualized educational plan for each resident. Assure diverse clinical experience in the outpatient and inpatient settings, where resident learning is a priority and faculty are supported and equipped to help residents' growth toward becoming an independent practitioner. Deliver an innovative curriculum with emphasis on active, simulated and experiential learning environments that position the program to exceed the national average for the certifying exam. Develop a cu lture within medical education that promotes and expands upon the research mission of the institution. Utilize well- being consults and coaching to ensure that resident physicians are able to recognize the benefits of proactive psychological support to opti mize physician performance and to best serve patients. Cultivate an environment within the residency program that fosters respect and kindness towards others and offers support and encouragement in all situations. In collaboration with the Arkansas Colle ge of Osteopathic Medicine's affiliated partners, deliver a robust longitudinal experiential quality improvement and patient safety curriculum ensuring that residents are exposed to institutional quality and safety practices so that they may be future leaders in this space. 4 Rotation Goals and Objectives Mercy Hospital Fort Smith Family Medicine Residency Program Inpatient Medicine Overall Goals and Objectives: Goals: Develop appropriate interpersonal skills to establish a quality doctor -patient relationship with sensitivity to emotional, physical, cultural and socioeconomic environment.

This rotation seeks to identify the unique and critical elements that might not be adequately addressed in other curricular areas (e.g., medicine, pediatrics, surgery, obstetrics, orthopedi cs, ophthalmology). Prompt assessment, intervention, and disposition are critical elements of the emergency medicine experience and are frequently performed in the face of multiple simultaneous patient encounters.

In providing a wide range of medical services, the family physician can provide preventive and wellness care, diagnose general medical illnesses and disease processes unique to women, and care for women and their families. The goal of these guidelines is to familiarize the family medicine resident with attitudes, knowledge, and skills that are important for the care of women and their families. Family physicians must be trained to care for women throughout the life cycle and must appreciate challenges such as adolescence, sexuality, family planning, balance of family life and career, and aging within the female patient's culture. Health promotion \u2014 including screeni ng, counseling, and vaccination\u2014is a foundation of family medicine. For the majority of their reproductive lives, most women try to prevent pregnancy, so we highlight this aspect of care. The psychological and physiologic changes of menarche, contraception, pregnancy, lactation, and menopause impact women in many aspects of their lives, requiring clinical skills on the family physician's part to provide education, diagnostic testing, treatment, and appropriate referral that is safe and effective. Women are living to an advanced age more frequently than their male counterparts, therefore cognitive, affective, and functional assessments, as well as end -of-life discussions, are important aspects of care.

Manage and coordinate with specialists, service lines, and care management in delivering the appropriate interventions to patients under care. Become competent and confident in the care and disposition of the patient. Objectives: The resident will gain knowledge of common inpatient and outpatient gynecological issues through one -on-one discussions and precepting with the attending physician, teaching rounds and also by independent reading. The resident will be expected to develop teaching skills thr ough the participation of teaching medical students and junior residents in the inpatient and outpatient settings. 21 The resident will be evaluated in the 6 core competencies (Medical Knowledge, Patient Care, Interpersonal Communication Skills, Professionali sm, Practiced -Based Learning and Systems -Based Practice).

Skin conditions remain among the top 20 leading reasons for office visits to family physicians. With skin complaints, pattern recognition is extremely important. Family physicians must de velop keen observational skills and consistently use appropriate terminology to characterize skin lesions. A family physician must have knowledge of differential diagnoses associated with various lesion types and must know where to access appropriate, reli able information in a timely manner using textbooks or online resources.

Family physicians generally offer a unique model of prenatal and intrapartum/postpartum care in which physicians attend the major ity of their own patients' deliveries, and both the woman and her baby often continue to see their family physician for ongoing women's health, medical, and well - child care. This unique experience continues to be essential in residency training, but it mus t be underpinned by achievement of competency in appropriate history taking and physical examination skills, knowledge of the physiologic and psychosocial aspects of caring for women, and certain specific, hands -on procedural skills. Even those family phys icians who do not choose to include maternity care in their scope of practice should be comfortable with and competent in the care of medical issues in women during pregnancy and lactation, as well as the management of contraception and preconception couns eling.

As patients live longer with chronic debilitating diseases as a result of technological advances, and the aging population continues to grow, it is vital to improve and refine our teaching of palliative and end -of-life care. One of medicine's most important missions is to allow terminally ill patients to die with as much dignity, comfort, and control as possible. Recognizing that palliative medicine is focused on relieving and improving quality of life in patients for whom a cure is not possible, there is still an enormous amount of care and support that can and should be provided for patients and their families. Many of the tenet s embodied in family medicine are very important in the care of the dying. A holistic approach to the patient's physical and psychosocial well -being, a focus on the family, continuity of care, and an emphasis on quality of life are four important principl es that make the family physician uniquely suited to care for the terminally ill. The end of life is one of the most critical times in the physician -patient relationship. Palliative medicine may be combined with other treatments or modalities with a ther apeutic goal, or it may be the complete focus, as in hospice care. A family physician providing and coordinating hospice or other team care for a dying patient can ease physical symptoms and provide social, emotional, and spiritual support. This care and s upport can set the stage for very meaningful experiences.
