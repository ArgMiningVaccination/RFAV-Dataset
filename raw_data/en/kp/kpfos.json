That's why we created the Dr. Diane Barton Complementary Medicine Program. This important program enhances the quality of life and wellness of individuals living with, through and beyond a cancer diagnosis. It utilizes therapies that focus on mind, body and spirit while supporting mainstream medical care. Our complementary therapies are designed to lessen the pain, stress and anxiety associated with cancer. They also provide assistance in handling the side effects of such traditional treatments as radiation and chemotherapy. Proven Benefits of Complementary Therapies While complementary therapies cannot cure cancer, many patients have found them to be helpful in managing and coping with their cancer. While traditional medicine and healthcare treat the illness, complementary medicine therapies help promote wellness in the whole person. In addition to the therapeutic benefits, taking part in complementary medicine therapies empowers participants - providing them with an opportunity to take a positive, active role in their care and treatment.
