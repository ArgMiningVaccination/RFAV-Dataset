Natural products and herbal medicines have received increased attention in recent years due to the side effects associated with conventional therapies and to meet the growing demand for more natural products that do not contain toxins. Recently, both clinical and bench research has started to provide scientific validation for the use of certain natural products and herbal extracts for the management of human diseases and disorders. Several related investigations have revealed biological mechanisms of action which have been translated into clinical practice of herbal extracts and natural products. Further research in this field will help improve the availability of therapeutic approaches based on natural products and herbal medicine for the management of human diseases. There is also a need to validate the bioactivity of natural products and herbal extracts, evaluate their quality, efficacy, and safety, and decipher their interactions with conventional drugs. The aim of this Special Issue is to publish high-quality original research and review papers evaluating the potential of natural products and herbal extracts used in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for the management of human diseases. Emerging approaches to evaluate the efficacy and safety of natural products and herbal medicines and approaches to decipher their mechanisms of action are also welcome. Potential topics include but are not limited to the following: - Phytochemical analysis and bioactivity of herbal extracts used as CAM - Quality, and efficacy of natural health products/herbal extracts used as CAM - Dietary supplements used as CAM - Safety evaluation of natural products/herbal extracts used as CAM - Mechanism of action of natural products/herbal extracts used as CAM - Herb-herb and herb-drug interactions Articles - Special Issue - - Volume 2023 - - Article ID 9780150 - - Retraction Retracted: Treatment of Elderly Femoral Intertrochanteric Fracture by InterTan Intramedullary Nail and PFNA - Special Issue - - Volume 2023 - - Article ID 9768306 - - Retraction Retracted: TILRR Aggravates Sepsis-Induced Acute Lung Injury by Suppressing the PI3K/Akt Pathway - Special Issue - - Volume 2023 - - Article ID 9758175 - - Retraction Retracted: The Characteristics of Fear of Recurrence and the Effect of Cognitive-Behavioral Stress Management Intervention in Patients after Radiofrequency Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation - Special Issue - - Volume 2023 - - Article ID 9876457 - - Retraction Retracted: High CHAF1A Expression Levels Are Positively-Correlated with PD-L1 Expression and Indicate Poor Prognosis in Gastric Cancer - Special Issue - - Volume 2023 - - Article ID 9859735 - - Retraction Retracted: Prognostic Evaluation of Lucentis in Diabetic Retinopathy and Neovascular Glaucoma - Special Issue - - Volume 2023 - - Article ID 9767043 - - Retraction Retracted: Clinical Effect of Nursing Based on the Kano Model in Emergency Multiple Injuries - Special Issue - - Volume 2023 - - Article ID 9758919 - - Retraction Retracted: AXL Inhibits Proinflammatory Factors to Relieve Rheumatoid Arthritis Pain by Regulating the TLR4/NF-B Signaling Pathway - Special Issue - - Volume 2023 - - Article ID 9893576 - - Retraction Retracted: An Immune-Related Prognostic Risk Model in Colon Cancer by Bioinformatics Analysis - Special Issue - - Volume 2023 - - Article ID 9761986 - - Retraction Retracted: The Effect of Tedlar Bags on the Composition of Exhaled Human Breath Samples - Special Issue - - Volume 2023 - - Article ID 9821574 - - Retraction Retracted: Effects of Albumin Supplements on In-Hospital Mortality in Patients with Sepsis or Septic Shock: A Systemic Review "}
