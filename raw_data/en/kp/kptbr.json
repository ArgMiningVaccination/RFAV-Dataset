Received: 24 September 2012; in revised form : 16 October 2012 / Accepted: 5 November 2012 / Published: 7 November 2012 Abstract: Autism is a condition characterized by im paired cognitive and social skills, associated with compromised immune functio n. The incidence is alarmingly on the rise, and environmental factors are increasingly suspec ted to play a role. This paper investigates word frequency patterns in the U.S. CDC Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) database. Our results provide strong evidence supporting a link between autism and the aluminum in vaccines. A literature re view showing toxicity of aluminum in human physiology offers further support. Mentions of autism in VAERS increased steadily at the end of the last century, dur ing a period when mercury was being phased out, while aluminum adjuvant burden was being increa sed. Using standard log-likelihood ratio techniques, we identify several signs and symptoms that are significantly more prevalent in vaccine reports after 2000, includ ing cellulitis, seizure, depression, fatigue, pain and death, which are also significantly associated w ith aluminum-containing vaccines. We propose that children with the autism diagnosis are esp ecially vulnerable to toxic metals such as aluminum and mercury due to insufficient serum sulfate and glutathione. A strong correlation between autism and the MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) vaccine is also observed, which may be partially explained via an increased sensitivity to acetaminophen administered to and, more broadly, autism spectrum disord er (ASD), is a condi tion characterized by impaired cognitive and social skills [1], along with a compromised immune function [2-5]. It can now no longer be denied that the incide nce of ASD is alarmingly on the rise in the U.S. [6]. While it has been suggested that the observed incr ease in rates may be due mainly to a change in diagnosis criteria, the actual criteria have changed very little fr om 1943 to DSM-IV-TR [7-9]. Despite considerable research efforts devoted to trying to uncover the cause(s) of autism, thus far no definitive answer seems available from the research literature. However, the fact that ASD rates have been rapidly increasing over the last two decades strongly points to an environmen tal component. Indeed, autism is recently being reframed from being a strictly gene tic disease to representing a complex interaction between genetics and environmental factors, suggesting that we shoul d focus our attention more on \"environmentally responsive genes\" [10]. The ASD community has maintained a long-standi ng conviction that vaccina tion plays a causative role in ASD [11], an idea that has been vehe mently denied by the vaccine industry [12], but nonetheless is still hotly debated [13]. A study pub lished in 2011 has confirmed a positive correlation between the proportion of children who received vaccina tions in each state over the interval from 2001 to 2007 and the incidence of autism or speech and la nguage impairment [14]. For each 1% increase in vaccination rate, 680 additional children were diagnosed with autism or speech delay. In [15], we proposed that a causativ e factor in autism is an inadequa te supply of chol esterol sulfate, both in utero and postnatally. Cholesterol sulfate synthesis in the skin is catalyzed by sun exposure [16]. We hypothesized that autism may be induced by a co mbination of inadequate dietary sulfur and insufficient sun exposure to the skin, for both the mother and the chil d. A meta-study involving oxidative-stress related biomarkers pr esent in association with autism id entified a consistent deficiency in reduced glutathione [17], an impo rtant sulfur-based antioxidant that also plays a role in detoxifying aluminum. We proposed that cysteine, the rate-l imiting amino acid involved in the synthesis of glutathione [18], is depleted through redirection into an alternative pa thway to produce sulfate, due to the impaired sulfate synthesis from thiosulfate in the skin. A recent study of biomarkers for 28 individuals with an ASD diagnosis showed reduced glutathione, cysteine, and sulfate compared to c ontrols, and the authors proposed that a reduced detoxification capacity might impede mercury excre tion [19]. These same authors observed a marked reduction in serum sulfate in association with ASD in another paper [20]. In par ticular, the level of free sulfate in the blood stream was onl y 33% of the level found in cont rol subjects. We hypothesize that sulfate deficiency results in insufficient ionic buffe ring in the vasculature, with grossly inadequate sulfation of the extracellular matrix proteins that are essential for proper colloidal suspension of particles and cells [21,22]. Entropy 2012 , 14 2229 Glutathione [23] and sulfate are also es sential for the detoxification of xenobiotics and commonly administered drugs like acetaminophen in the liver. Seleni um, a trace metal in the same column of the periodic table as oxygen and sulfur , has been shown to prot ect against acetaminophen toxicity [25], and it has also been shown to be severely depleted in hair and nail samples from individuals on the au tism spectrum [26]. A possible link has been found between acetaminophen and both autism and asthma [27]. The association of both asthma [28] and eczema [29] with ASD can be e xplained as an inadequate supply of filaggrin, due to the fact that cholesterol sulf ate in the epidermis stimulates the production of profilaggrin, its precursor [3 0]. Filaggrin plays an essential role in maintaining th e epithelial barrier [31], and its impairment leads to increas ed risk of both asthma [32] a nd eczema [33,34]. Thus cholesterol sulfate deficiency provides an explanation for the multiple links among autism, acetaminophen, asthma, and eczema. It has been demonstrated that chronic aluminum e xposure in rats induces depl etion of glutathione in the liver as well as a significant reduction in the s ynthesis of bile acids [35], which are conjugated with taurine, the only sulfonic amino acid [36]. Taur ine administration in co njunction with aluminum greatly ameliorates the adverse e ffects of aluminum on the liver, and this was explained as possibly due to the ability of the sulfonate group in taurine to bind with heavy metals such as aluminum [37]. These results suggest that gl utathione and taurine are both involved in aluminum detoxifica tion in the liver. Many children with autism have a low amount of serum glutathione , with a larger fraction of it oxidized to GSSG [38]. Furthermore, increased use of antibiotics leads to an alteration in gut flora which impairs the ability to detoxify toxic metals like mercury. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), an organosulfur compound with two thiol groups, has b een found to be effective in ameliorating the symptoms of autism in placebo contro lled studies [39], likely through its ability to enable the excretion of toxic metals such as lead and mercury [40]. It al so led to a normalization of glutathione levels in red blood cells [40]. Vitamin D deficiency has been hypothesized to be a risk factor for autism [41]. The over-zealous application of sunscreen is strong ly implicated in autism, not only because sunscreen interferes with the production of vitamin D 3 and cholesterol sulfate but also be cause it often co ntains aluminum, particularly the high Sun Protection Factor (SPF) s unblock products. Aluminum, due in part to its +3 ionic charge, is highly toxic to biological systems [42,43] as will be described more fully in Section 2.1. Indeed, there are no known life form s that utilize aluminum in any biological systems. The poorly developed barrier function of th e autistic child's epidermis would likely lead to an increased penetration of aluminum through the skin. Furthermor e, their serum sulfate deficiency leads to an impaired ability to dispose of aluminum. Aluminum would therefor e be expected to accumulate over time, and, due to increased permeability of the blood brain barrier associated with autism [44], would almost certainly interfere with neuron function. In the next section, we examine the evidence from the literature that aluminum toxicity may play a role in vaccine adverse reactions, and we describe available theories for th e mode of toxicity of aluminum and other toxic metals. Entropy 2012 , 14 2230 2. Aluminum and Mercury in Vaccines It has recently been proposed that aluminum, co mmonly used in vaccines as an adjuvant, may be the most significant factor in adve rse reactions, and, furthermore, that the nervous system is especially vulnerable to aluminum toxicity [45] . Vaccine clinical tria ls often include aluminum in the placebo, at the same or greater concentratio ns than the amount found in th e vaccine [46-49]. A comparable number of adverse reactions betwee n vaccine and placebo in these trials suggests that aluminum is an important source of toxicity in the vaccine. Indee d, intraperitoneal injection of aluminum-adsorbed vaccine in mice caused a transient rise in aluminum in brain tissues [50]. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has set an upper limit of 5 micrograms Al/kg/day for neonates and individuals with impaired kidney func tion [51]. A highly informative recent review of a possible relationship between aluminum toxicity and Alzheimer's disease [52] also discussed issues related to the aluminum burden in children's vaccine s. There, it was pointed out that children today receive a cumulative aluminum burden from vaccines that may exceed the FDA limit by a factor of 50. The vaccine industry has a difficult task in designi ng vaccines that are both safe and effective [53]. The use of weakened but live pathogens can lead to vaccine-induced disease in children with an impaired immune system, yet debris from dead pathogens may not always cause a sufficient reaction to induce the production of antigen -specific memory CD8 T-cells, required for protection against future exposure. The industry widely reports success in creating vaccines with dead pathogens by adding adjuvants such as aluminum, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from E. coli , and polycationic surfactants, to further stimulate the immune respons e [54]. It remains unclear exactly how aluminum achieves its effect of enhancing the immune react ion, but aluminum adjuva nts are now thought to impact on humoral systems via their positive in fluence on the inflammasome complexes [55]. Another industry-claimed basis for adding alumin um or mercury to vacci nes is to increase the stability of the antigen in long-term storage. It has been shown that the rate of acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of glucose-1-phosphate is significantly slower when the mole cule is adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide adjuvant, increasing the effective pH of the environment by 2 pH un its [56]. This effect would however also interfere with the human body' s ability to break down the antigen from the vaccine, which may partially explain the heightened immune reaction. Based on concerns that the mercury (49.6% by wei ght) in thimerosal might be contributing to autism [57], the industry made an effort to sign ificantly reduce the amount of mercury present in vaccines beginning in the late 1990' s [58]. In parallel, they be gan storing the vaccines in individualized glass vials\u2014to avoi d the ostensible need for a preser vative to reduce the danger of contaminating repeated invasions of multidose vials. However, th is raises another concern, as aluminum can be leached out of the glass vial a nd the rubber stopper during storage [59]. This same issue can also affect premature infants given seru m albumin infusions, resulting in an inadvertent exposure to aluminum very early in life [60]. Glass contains aluminum oxide at levels ra nging from 1.9% to 5.8% [61]. Leaching from a container is an ongoing process until the product is used. Storage cont ainers contribute significantly to aluminum contamination in human serum albumin products. Because of impaired renal function, dialysis patients are at risk to developing encephal opathy and a severe form of dementia due to their inability to dispose of the small amounts of aluminum that could be present in th e dialysis water base [62], Entropy 2012 , 14 2231 although this problem has been largely corrected toda y. We suggest that the effect of aluminum on the brain of a person already on the autism sp ectrum may manifest a similar pathology. Mechanisms of Aluminum and Mercury Toxicity Aluminum is one of the most common elements on Earth, yet no biological system has yet found a use for it. Aluminum is expected to induce biosemiotic entropy thr ough multiple pathways [22,63,64]. Its +3 charge highly kosmotropic properties make it extremely destructive in water-based biological systems. One purely biophysical mechanis m might involve its direct effect upon interfacial water tension. Another less direct mechanism might involve competition for calmodulin binding and the initiation of a signaling cascade with profound consequences. Both phenomena would likely induce biosemiotic entropy through bot h supramolecular and epigenetic effect s. Thus, a focus limited solely to genetics and molecular biology is likely to be misguided. L ong-range, dynamically-structured interfacial water is the medium which, when ener gy-loaded, both conveys the biological message and overcomes the thermal diffusion pr oblem [65,66]. When interfacial water is energy-unloaded, the biological message is corrupted: unfolded protei n responses and apoptosis follow. We posit that aluminum is a sine qua non of biosemiotic entropy an exogenous interfacial water stressor. Since aluminum is a known neurotoxin, there is no safe level. The centr al nervous system is particularly susceptible to the deleterious effects of aluminum. Exposure of human neuronal cells to a low concentration (100 nM) of aluminum sulfate indu ces a response that emulates the gene expression changes associated with Alzheimer's disease [67] . Recently, a group of researchers investigated the effect of aluminum sulfate on an in vitro culture of human neural ce lls [63], which was directly compared to the effect of magnesium -, iron- and zinc sulfate. They c onfirmed that, by contrast with the other salts, aluminum sulfate had an unus ual and significant ability to induce NF- B signaling and subsequent reactive oxygen species (ROS), me diated by down-regulation of the important inflammation inhibitor, complement f actor H (CFH). In a subsequent pa per, the sulfates of 13 different cations were assessed for their ability to indu ce ROS in neuronal culture s, and aluminum was determined to stand out among all the ions studied for its remarkable ability to induce ROS, even compared with mercury and lead [64]. Aluminum i nduced a response that was a factor of seven higher than that of mercury and a factor of three higher than that of lead. Aluminum adjuvants damage and rupture the pha golysosomes, generate reactive oxygen species, and induce potassium efflux from the cell [68]. Our research has led us to suspect disruption of calmodulin (CaM) signaling as on e of the most destructive aspe cts of aluminum toxicity. CaM functions as a calcium sensor and si gnal transducer that regulates a num ber of distinct protein targets, influencing many different cellu lar functions [69]. Upon bindi ng to calcium, CaM undergoes a conformational change, and subsequent transforma tions such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation can modulate its action. The aluminum ion is a potent inhibitor of volta ge-gated calcium channels in the brain [70]. Normally, calmodulin (CaM), after binding to calci um, stimulates nitric oxide (NO) production by (eNOS) and neuronal nitric oxide (nNOS). An investigation of the interaction of aluminum ions with bovine brain CaM [71], confirmed that aluminum binds to CaM with an affi nity that is an orde r of magnitude stronger than that of calcium. Entropy 2012 , 14 2232 Interaction with aluminum induces a conformational change in the molecular structure. A molar ratio of 4:1 for aluminum/CaM completely blocks the acti vity of prot ein's flexibility and disrupt its struct ural integrity. Severe impairment of astrocyte function has b een demonstrated in conjunction with aluminum exposure [72,73]. Aluminum appears to interfere with iron-sulfur clus ters in the mitochondria, causing impaired ATP synthesis, excess production of reactiv e oxygen species, and impaired formation of the cytoskeleton, which is essential for the cell's f unction in maintaining the health of neighboring neurons. Cells exposed to as litt le as 0.01 mM concentrations of aluminum show a disrupted actin cytoskeleton and a drastic morphologi cal change into a globular conf iguration. Due to its cationic +3 charge, aluminum causes in vitro aggrega tion of neurofilaments char acteristic of many human neurological diseases [42]. NO Synthesis by eNOS after aluminum exposure : An excessive producti on of NO can result in anaphylactic shock, a life-threatenin g allergic reaction, a ssociated with overexube rant vasodilation and a precipitous drop in blood pressure. A recent experi ment with mice triggered anaphylactic shock by exposing the mice to an injection containing alum inum hydroxide and pert ussis toxin [74]. This resulted in the excess synthesis of NO by eNOS, and a subsequent signaling cascade, mediated by the phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway. We hypothesize that aluminum's propensity to bind strongly to CaM mediated this response. Aluminum's Effects on Neurons : A novel characteristic of the autistic br ain is that it is larger than the non-autistic brain at the age of two or three [75], an e ffect that is hypothe sized to be due to an impaired glutamate-mediated neuronal-pruning developmenta l phase. Overgrowth is observed in cerebral, and limbic stru ctures underlying cognitive, social, em otional, and language functions [76]. Significantly, a study involving prenatal aluminum exposure revealed an effect on neurons in rat brains suggesting resistance to apoptosis following glut amate signaling, a potentially related phenomenon [77]. Glutamate-induced neuronal d eath was significantly reduced in primary cultures of cerebellar neurons taken from aluminum-exposed rats. The eff ect was shown to be medi ated by a disruption of CaM signaling to induce nNOS ac tivity, analogous to th e CaM-related effect of aluminum in endothelial cells. Aluminum and Mercury Impact Zeta Potential and Sulfate Recycling : Zeta potential (ZP) is defined by the rate at which a charged particle suspended in a medium will travel in an applied electric field. A high negative value for zeta potential is essential for maintaining blood as a colloidal suspension [21]: cells and complex molecules suspen ded in the blood avoid flocculati on through a negative charge field maintained in the immediate surrounding space. One of the main functions of serum albumin is to control colloid stability in the blood [78]. Both mercury and aluminum bind str ongly to cysteines in serum albumin in the blood [79,80]. The adsorption of aluminum onto seru m albumin has a profound effect on serum zeta potential (ZP) [80], driving it even to positive values at physiological pH with suffici ent concentrations of aluminum hydroxide. It is believed that much of the mercury that is filtered into the proximal tubular lumen in the glomerulus of the kidney is present primarily as a conjugate of albumin, bound to the sulfhydryl group of constituent Hg2+ salts bound serum albumin would be expected to cause a simila r effect as aluminum on serum ZP. Entropy 2012 , 14 2233 Mercury has a great predilection for bonding to redu ced sulfur atoms, esp ecially those in thiol- containing molecules such as glutathione, cystei ne, homocysteine, and The affinity of oxygen-or nitrogen-c ontaining ligands is about 10 orde rs of magnitude lower [79]. A study on oral exposure to methylmercury in mice conf irmed that the methylmercury is absorbed, taken up by the liver, and then exported via the bile acids, likely bound to bio-or ganic sulfate. These researchers demonstrated a complete inability to dispose of methylmercury in neonate animals, confirming that newborns are much more susceptible to mercury toxi city than adults [81]. It was shown that this impaired disposal was due in part to insufficient glutathione in the liver. A study on infant monkeys confirmed that the ethylmercury in thimeros al that is injected into the primate is more readily stored as inorganic mercury in the brain than is ora lly-delivered ethylmercury, and that inorganic mercury tends to linger longer in the tissues [82]. Exposure to thimerosal leads to abnormal glutamate transport in neurons in mous e hippocampi [83]. Mercur y also has an adverse effect on sulfate recycling in the glomeruli, leading to a net loss of sulfate via the urine. A noticeable reduction in the production of dermatan sulfate is associated with mercury exposure, via an effect on the mesangial cells [84]. Thus, mercury would be expect ed to either build up to toxic levels or further reduce sulfate bioavailability in th e child with autism . 3. Related Work 3.1. MMR Vaccine It has been suggested that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine may be contributing to the increased prevalence of autis m in recent decades [85]. A larg e population-based study involving children born in Denmark between 1991 and 1998 has seemingly proven otherwise [12]. In comparing 440,000 vaccinated children with 96,000 unvaccinated chil dren, the authors claime d that no significant difference in the incidence of autism was detected between the two groups. Ho wever, there are several concerns with this study. The first one is that th e reasons for not vaccinating were not determined, and it is likely that important reasons might have been the presence of autism in a close family member, thus predisposing the non-vaccinated population to auti sm due to the inheritabi lity of the disease (or, the fact that the mother still has the nutritional de ficiency that caused the older sibling's autism). Another possibility for exclusion is an actual diagnosis of autism, or an adverse reaction to some other vaccine, a feature that is also likely a ssociated with increased risk of autism. The second concern has to do with the way the data were analyzed. It would seem to be logical to divide the 0-3 age group into two subsets, one before 15 months and one after 15 months, in order to more easily assess the relevance of MMR (administered at 15 months) to the autism diagnosis. But the authors chose to combine all cases under 3 into a si ngle category in the summary table they presented in the paper. Furthermore, any diagnoses before 15 months were inexplicably put into the \"not- vaccinated\" group, whereas they should have s imply been excluded. The non-vaccinated group had, relatively speaking, more diagnoses before three years, but some unknown percentage of these, possibly even all of them, occurr ed before the 15-month cut-off. By contrast, substantially fewer cases of autis m were diagnosed in the window between 3 and 5 years in the not-vaccinated group, if the two populations are distributed equally by age. From the Entropy 2012 , 14 2234 numbers in their table, one can compute a 41% incr eased relative frequency of autism diagnosis in the vaccinated versus the unvaccinated population in this age range, a number that might well have been statistically significant had it been singled out. Finally, it is likely that other vaccines in addition to MMR play a role in autism, particularly since, unlike many vaccines, MMR contains neither thimer osal nor aluminum. MMR is often administered simultaneously with DTaP, an aluminum-containing v accine. The synergistic and cumulative effects of multiple vaccines would likely lead to nonlinear enhancement of adverse events. It has been claimed that Denmark had excluded thim erosal from all vaccines prior to the birth of any of the children in the study [86]. If this is true, then this is in stark cont rast to the U.S. policy, where thimerosal still appears in several vacci nations given to young children, including Hep-B and HiB Titer. Aluminum is present in several of the vaccines, for exam ple, Hep-B, PREVNAR, all of the DTaP formulations, and H1N1 flu vaccine multidose vials. 3.2. Other Related Work Aluminum adjuvants are the only adjuvants appr oved for use. They are known to enhance the specificity, intensity, and duration of the immune response, leading to improved long-term protection from the disease [87]. A workshop was held in 2002 in San Juan, Puer to Rico, addressing the issues associated with aluminum in vaccines, with a pa rticular focus on myalgias and fatigue in adults following vaccination exposure to aluminum [88]. A recently published article seriously addresses the question of the safety of aluminum adjuvants in vaccines, po inting out the neurotoxic ity of aluminum [45]. A U.S.-based study published in 2010 [89] determined that a three-fo ld increased risk to autism was associated with neonatal administration of Hepatitis B (Hep-B) vaccine prior to 1999, compared with either no vaccination or a delay until after the fi rst month of age. Notably, Hep-B contains both aluminum and mercury. Several researchers have reported increased frequencie s of either sudden death or other health crises such as anaphylaxis or cardiorespiratory problems in association with vaccines. In [90], it was reported that six infants died suddenly within 48 hours of having received a hexavalent vaccine, a frequency that is abnormally high compared to the risk of SIDS in the general popul ation. Unexpectedly high SIDS rates following vaccination are al so reported in [91]. Researchers in Italy [92] report that the first vaccination carries an increased risk to SIDS in infants. In [93], through statistical analysis based on 300 cases of unexplained sudden death, a 16-fold incr eased risk was determined following the fourth dose in a series of vaccinations. In [94], it was reported that the obser ved rate of anaphylaxis following administration of the HPV vaccine to females aged 12 to 26 was significantly higher than the rate observed following other vaccines. In [95], precau tionary monitoring is recommended following vaccination of premature infants, due to observed adve rse reactions related to cardiorespiratory events, as well as a substantial increase in serum levels of C reactive protein, an inflammatory marker. This was particularly true for DTaP, an aluminum- cont aining vaccine, especially when it was combined with concomitant vaccines. Goldman and Miller [96] have previously examin ed the VAERS database, specifically looking at hospitalization rates and mortality statistics as a function of the number of vaccines simultaneously administered and of age. Linear regression analysis revealed several statistically significant trends, Entropy 2012 , 14 2235 including a positive correlation between hospitalization rates and number of vaccine doses. In addition, mortality rates for infants under six months were significantly higher than rates for children between six months and one year of age, suggesting increas ed sensitivity of neonates. The authors suggested delaying administering of vaccines as a strategy fo r reducing risk of a severe adverse reaction. These authors also emphasize the value of VAERS as an important postmarketing safety surveillance tool. Studies on adverse reactions for vaccination of adults have also been performed. A 2002 study of the VAERS database related to Hepatitis B vacci ne confirmed a significant number of adverse reactions in adults [97] . A case study published in 2009 described an adult's profound adverse reaction to multiple vaccinations containing aluminum, resulti ng in aluminum hydroxide deposits accumulating in macrophages in muscle cells, along with debilitating muscle pain and weakness associated with chronic fatigue syndrome and macrophagic myofasciitis [98]. 4. Our Studies with U.S. CDC VAERS Database The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAE RS) is a surveillance system implemented by the U.S. government, which allows doctors and/or pa tients to report any adve rse reactions observed in association with vaccines. The cover page emphasizes that the data report onl y an association rather than a confirmed causal relationship. Data are r eadily available for download from the web site, \"http://vaers.hhs.gov/index\" beginning in the year 1990. In this section, we will present the results of several experiments we conducted with the VAERS database, using standard statistical techniques based on word frequency information. In order to validate our methods, we first exam ined the differences between a set of records associated with autism and a comparison set drawn randomly from the remaining records. The autism- related data set contained all cases where the wo rd \"autism\" or the word \"autistic\" showed up somewhere in the report. This yielded a total of 1,734 entries. The comparison set was constructed by randomly sampling from the remaining entries (~340,000 reports), but in such a way that the age distribution was exactly matched to the distribution obtained from the records associated with autism, obtaining a record of identical size ( 1,734) to that of the autism set. We performed a statistical analysis of selected words and phrases in the \"symptom text\" field as well as in the five \"symptoms\" fields in the associated VAERSSYMPTOM files. We used an established method based on log likelihood ratio, as described in [99,100], which provides a p-value associated with the likelihood that th e observed distribution bias of the word or phrase could have occurred by chance. To improve stat istical power, we collected the most frequently occurring words in the \"symptoms\" fields, and orga nized them into e class \"abdominal pain.\" Table 1 shows all of the words or phrases that were biased towards the autism data set with a p-value at or below 0.05. Constipation [101], anxiet [28], eczema [29] and premature birth [103] have all been found to be associated with autism in the re search literature. We consider it to be a validation of our methods th at we detected these features with a statistic ally significant p-value. This also implies that the VAERS database may be useful for predicting associations between symptoms and conditions, irrespective of any clai m about the effects of a particular vaccine. Entropy 2012 , 14 2236 Prematurity would be expected to be a risk factor for ASD, as the cholestero l sulfate supply from the placenta is normally greatly increased toward the end of pregnancy [104]. Premature infants may also suffer from additional aluminum expos ure through albumin infusions [60]. Table 1. Skewed distributions of symptom words between two data sets: a set of vaccine adverse reactions associated with autism, and an age-matched set of other vaccine reactions. C1: number of entries in autism se t containing this symptom; C2: Number of entries containing this symp tom in the comparison set. p-value: the likelihood that the distribution would have occurred by chance according to a log-likelihood ratio formulation. Symptom C1 C2 p-value Anxiety 49 2 0.011 Constipation 41 0 0.012 Infection 54 6 0.013 Ear infection 32 3 0.029 Eczema 18 0 0.044 Premature 20 1 0.046 Asthma 24 3 0.048 Pneumonia 19 1 0.050 Note: In this and subsequent tables, we use the word \"symptom\" inclusively to refer to signs, symptoms and conditions. Three associated words suggestive of a weakened immune system, \"i nfection,\" \"ear infection,\" and \"pneumonia\" support the observation fr om the literature that autism is associated with immune dysfunction [2]. It has also been demonstrated th at children with the autism diagnosis exhibit a heightened immune response to anti gen stimulation [105], which we pr opose is caused by their global deficiency in sulfate supply. Thus, their increased vul nerability to infection in general likely parallels an increased likelihood of an adve rse reaction to vaccines, particul arly vaccines like MMR where the pathogen is only weaken ed but not killed. 4.1. Distribution of Vaccine Ty pes in Autism versus Controls Another aspect we investigated from the VAERS data base is to compare the distribution of type of vaccine administered between the autism-related events and the non-au tism-related events. The results are shown in Table 2. We looked only at data for children under 6 years old, and we computed the percentage of events associated with each vaccine type in each data set. As shown in Table 2, MMR was significantly more likely to be associated with autism (41% of the autism-associated events as against only 15% of the non-autism associated events , with a ratio of 2.67). HiB Titer and hepatitis were also over-represented in the autism group, although to a lesser degree. Since MMR contains neither aluminum nor mercury, it is puzzling that children with the autism diagnosis seem to be highly sensitive to it. We have not examined the records in detail to determine what percentage had autism before receiving the vaccine, and, in fact, in many cases this information is not available from the VAERS record, which may simply list autism as a feature. An interesting theory relating the MMR vaccine to ASD involves a proposed toxic reaction to the acetaminophen (paracetamol) administered to co ntrol fever following vaccination [25,106]. It has been proposed that Entropy 2012 , 14 2237 acetaminophen may mediate neur otoxicity in autism [107], and acetaminophen has been demonstrated to be toxic to developing mouse cortical neurons in vitro [108]. Table 2. Percentages of events associated with di fferent vaccine types in the autism data set versus the not autism data set, and the ratio between the two. The numbers add up to more than 100% due to the fact th at multiple vaccines are often simultaneously administered. Pathogen Percent Autism P ercent 154.94 122.99 1.26 A study of the ability of children with the autism diagnosis to dispose of paracetamol found that the ratio of paracetamol-sulfate to paracetamol-glucuroni de (PS/PG) in the urine of children with severe autism following acetaminophen administration was significantly lower ( p < 0.00002) than that measured for normal controls [109]. This result st rongly suggests an impaired ability to metabolize toxic substances via a sulfation pathway. If the MMR vaccine is administered simultaneously with DTaP, an aluminum-containing vaccine (as is ofte n the case), then the acetaminophen would likely interfere with the child's ability to dispose of the aluminum. The autism-associated events exhibited an 84% incr eased frequency of reactio ns to hepatitis, and an 80% increased frequency of reac tions to HiB Titer. While we included both Hep-A and B in the search, the matches were almost exclusively to Hep-B. Hep-B contains aluminum hydroxide and thimerosal, and HiB Tite r contains thimerosal. Hep-B is administered usually within 24 hours of bi rth, and most definitely in the first two months of life, and HiB Titer is administered three or four times before the ag e of 15 months. These two vaccinations would thus cause an accumulation of me rcury and aluminum along with a depletion of the bioavailability of sulfate prior to the MMR vacci ne in the vulnerable child, leaving them more susceptible to an infection arising from the live viru s administered in MMR, a nd a subsequent dose of Tylenol (acetaminophen) to curb fever. Another aspect we investigated was the number of events associated with autism as a function of the year the event was reported. Realizing that the report date and the event date can sometimes be separated by several years, we reported this deta iled profile over time based on the event date instead of the report date. In cases where the event date wa s unavailable, we used the report date instead. The results are shown in Figure 1. It is striking that the number rises steadil y over the last five years of the twentieth century, peaking around 2003. In the U.S., al uminum was allegedly phased in at the same time that mercury was phased out [110]. If the cu rrent CDC immunization sche dule [111] is followed, babies are injected with nearly 5 mg of aluminum by 18 months of age.

Symptom C1 2000 C2 0.00023 0.0040 Fatigue 0.00080 Insomnia 81 195 0.0089 230 71 0.0025 In order to better characterize the set of symptoms that are associated with aluminum-containing vaccines, we computed a tally of the total number of mentions of every symptom whose word frequency was associated with al uminum-containing vaccines with a p-value less than 0.01. There were twelve such symptom classes, namely: fatigue, se izure, blister, cellulitis, pain, swelling, injection site macule, insomnia, injection site reaction, infection, depression, and uveitis. We compiled this statistic based on all aluminum-containing events in the database. We then plotted a histogram over time of the result, to be compared with th e plot of the histogram of autism mentions in the events. Results are shown in Figure 2. This plot shows a steady rise from about 1997 to 2003. It is conceivable that the work shop on aluminum held in 2002 [88] had some impact in reducing the aluminum burden in vacci nes, although it is difficult to determine the adjustments of aluminum adjuva ntion in vaccines over time, due to lack of transparency. Figure 3 shows the ratio of the total number of aluminum-related adverse reactions associated with a particular year to the tota l number of aluminum-containing events occurring during that year. This number rises steadily over the turn of the century, reaching above 1.0 starting in the year 2000, and peaking at 1.4 in 2003. This means that multiple adverse reactions cellulitis and reaction site macule, for example, are occurring in association with a single adverse event. The peak at 2003 corresponds well with the peak in autism-related reports. Thus there are introduced both an increase in the number of events around 2000 as well as an increase in the potency of each event to i nduce a reaction. This could be explained as an increas ed sensitivity to aluminum in the population, possibly due to a synergistic effect of cumulative exposure to multiple toxins [113].

MMR Vaccine and Autism The occurrence of the feature \"autism\" in the v accines with aluminum were somewhat, but not dramatically, higher than those without aluminum (556 with, 443 without; p = 0.06); i.e., children with the autism diagnosis react to both aluminum-cont aining and non-aluminum-cont aining vaccines. We suspect this has to do with the im paired immune function in children with autism, which causes them to overreact to the MMR vaccine. Give n that an adverse reaction to MMR is highly over-represented in the autism subset, we decided to compare a subset of the database where only the MMR vaccine had been administered with a comparably-aged subset where the MMR vaccine had not been administered. The results are shown in Table 4. As might be e xpected, a diagnosis of in fection with measles, mumps, or chicken pox were highly significantly associated with the MMR vaccine, as well as the simple word \"rash\" ( p = 0.00000003). However, respiratory tract infection ( p = 0.042) and cough (p = 0.014) were also over-represented in the MMR s ubset; suggesting that child ren with an infection are more likely to react adversely to the vaccine. Since children with the autism diagnosis have a compromised immune function, they are more likely to be sick at the time of the injection. But, most interesting for our purposes were the association of fever ( p = 0.024) and autism ( p = 0.0067) with MMR. There were a total of 1840 adverse reactions men tioning fever in the MMR se t. This suggests to us that the acetaminophen connection may be correct that the fever associated with MMR exposure is treated with acetaminophen, which then becomes toxic to the brain of the child predisposed toward autism, because of their in ability to dispose of it. Acetaminophen would also deplete sulfate needed to detoxify aluminum in any concurrent al uminum-containing vaccine such as DTaP. Table 4.

Hepatitis B Vaccine and Autism An historical account of the introduction of mandatory vaccina tion at birth against Hep-B is presented in [114]. In 1991, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommended that all infant s be injected with the first dose of hepatitis B Entropy 2012 , 14 2242 vaccine at birth. Since the states control mand atory vaccination policy, th is recommendation was gradually put into law in nearly a ll of the states over the subseque nt decade. By 1998, most children in America were required to show pr oof of three doses of Hep-B prior to entering public school. Since Hep-B contains both mercur y and aluminum, and since it is administ ered at birth, it is likely to be a major factor contributing to the st eady rise in autism-related events in the latter half of the 1990's. The practice of requiring Hep-B administration at birth is likely to be ex tremely dangerous to children who are born with a su lfur deficiency. Furthermore, Hep-B booster shots are often administered in conjunction with the varicella vaccine (chicken pox). Children with a compromised immune system can respond to the live varicella vaccine by coming down with full blown chicken pox, and the infection in turn leads to increased vulnerability to the alumi num contained in th e Hep-B vaccine. Table 5. Symptoms associated with Hep-B vacci ne administered to children under six years old, with a p-value less than 0.05. The values obtained for aluminum over all age groups are shown on the right for comparison pu rposes. The two symptoms at the top were not statistically significantly associated with aluminum, and are likely attributable to the compounding effect of the simultaneously administered varicella vaccine. - chicken pox 80 3 0.0038 523 1152 - Autism 108 1 0.0014 0.029 Death 38 6 0.030 483 303 0.011 Low appetite 32 2 0.025 368 252 0.031 Motivated by these arguments, we decided to comp are vaccinations that in clude Hep-B with those that do not, over the age range from zero to six. Table 4 shows results for all symptoms with a p-value less than 0.05. The counts and p-values we obtained for aluminum are shown alongside the results for Hep-B for easy comparison. These results are a little hard to interpret beca use there is a mixture of responses to Hep-B, responses to the associated vari cella, and compounded responses. Ho wever, we can plausibly assume that \"rash\" and \"chicken pox\" are primarily due to varicella. \"Infec tion\" shows up significantly in both the Hep-B and the aluminum columns. This reflects th e fact that an associated infection (whether a simple cold or the chicken pox or something else) in creases the risk to alumin um toxicity, due to the additional burden on the immune system. All of the significant symptoms in the table\u2014macule , cellulitis, blister, seizure, abscess, death, and low appetite\u2014are also significant symptoms associat ed with the vaccines cont aining aluminum. This Entropy 2012 , 14 2243 result further supports the possibility that the al uminum in these vaccines administered to young children may be even more toxic than the mercury. A highly significant corre lation is found between \"autism\" and \"Hep-B\" ( p = 0.0014), confirming the results reported in [89]. The association of aluminum-containing vaccines in general with autism does not quite make statistical significance ( p = 0.06) compared to non-aluminum-containing vaccines. We explain this observation thr ough the high fever associated with MMR, a non-aluminum-containing vaccine, that leads to the common practice of ad ministering acetaminophen [25], which the autistic child cannot adequately detoxify. However, the fact that autism is so clearly associated with Hep-B gives one pause. 4.5. Limitations of the VAERS Database and the Experiments Cases of vaccine injury are most likely vastly underreported by physicians to VAERS, as has been observed for physician reports of drug adverse react ions [115]. We identified only 1,734 mentions of autism in the entire dataset, whereas the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, established in 1988, reports over 5,000 claims that autism is associated with vaccines. Another limitation is that it is not easy to distinguish cases where autism may have been a preexisting condition affecting the child's sensitivity to the vaccine, as contrasted w ith cases where the vaccine may have preceded, and therefore may potentially be causative in, a late r diagnosis of autism. Finally, both patients and physicians can submit reports, so quality control due to reporting bias or lack of expertise may be an issue. Not all of the reports cont ain a record of the date of the vaccination, and this introduces some error in the temporal relationships. 5. Discussion Autism is a disorder affecting cogni tive and social skills that has se vere implications on the ability of the affected individual to lead a productive and independent lif e. The alarming increase in the incidence of ASD in the last decade suggests that, while genetic factors are contributory, environmental triggers must also play a decisive ro le. In this paper, we argue that ASD is a condition characterized by a serum deficiency in sulfur metabo lites, particularly the sulfate anion, which results in an inability to safely dispose of mercury, aluminum, and acetaminophen. While the autism community has focused on the merc ury in thimerosal as the main culprit in vaccines, our studies with the VAERS database ha ve identified aluminum and acetaminophen as being likely even more damaging than mercury. Aluminum binds strongly to sulf ur-containing molecules, and the body depends on sulfur for the proper elim ination of both aluminum and acetaminophen, as well as mercury. Because of the sulfur defici encies, aluminum, mercury and acetaminophen likely accumulate in the autistic brain, leading to further damage. In [116], it is argued that safety assessments fo r vaccines have not included appropriate toxicity studies because vaccines have not be en viewed as inherently toxic, bu t that this poin t of view should be revisited in light of the increa sed awareness of the potential toxic ity of aluminum, particularly for infants and young children. They argue further that it is now well established that a bidirectional neuro-immune cross-talk regulates both the immune system and brain function. Entropy 2012 , 14 2244 The incidence of autism-related adverse events in the VAERS database continued to rise over the time period after the amount of thimerosal in the v accines had been sharpl y reduced. We hypothesize that this unanticipated consequence is due to simultaneous increases in the aluminum content, attributed to an increased number of required vaccines, in tentional addition of aluminum to achieve an adjuvant effect, as well as the lik ely further accumulation of aluminum as a consequence of leaching, given the new practice of storage in individual glass vial s with rubber stoppers. We identified several severe adverse reactions that were much more prevalent in reports fr om the second decade of the data, and showed that these same symptoms were al so much more prevalent for reports involving aluminum-containing vaccines compared to reports on vaccines without aluminum, over the entire data set. These symptoms include seizure, cyanosis, gaze palsy, depression, fatigue, insomnia, and death. Possibly contradictory to our propo sal is a study which showed el evations of lead, mercury and uranium in hair analyses of 40 children with autism compared with 40 controls, but these authors found no elevation of aluminum in th e hair [117]. However, the resu lt on mercury cont radicts another study which showed reduced mercury in the hair of infants with autism [118], and a third study which showed no statistical diffe rence in mercury conten t of hair between chil dren with autism and controls [11919]. A study in rats showed that oral antibiotics dramatically inhibit mercury excretion to 10% of normal levels [120]. It is conceivable that an inability to export alumin um into the hair, due to severe sulfate depletion, could complicate the interpreta tion of a metric based on aluminum content in hair. The depleted supply of sulfate in the blood stream leads to increased vulnerability to vascular stress, in turn leading to excess imm une cell activation, inflam mation, permeability leaks, and blood clots, attributable mainly to a low ZP. This same deficiency interferes with the child's ability to dispose of the aluminum, which eventually accumul ates in the brain and interferes with neural transmission. It is also likely that further aluminum exposure comes fr om aluminum in skin products such as high SPF sunscreen, particularly for the chil d whose barrier function is defectiv e due to inadequate cholesterol sulfate and filaggrin in the epidermis. Other pote ntial sources of aluminum are aluminum flocking agents in municipal water supplies, aluminum leaching from aluminum baby formula cans, and aluminum in the human milk supply to the breas tfeeding infant, absorbed by the mother from sunscreen, antiperspirants, antaci d medications, cooking utensils, etc. Our specific studies on the MMR vaccine and the Hep-B vaccine further support our theories involving aluminum and acetaminophen toxicity. In an an alysis of the distribution of vaccine types in events associated with autism versus the controls, we determined that MMR was highly over-represented in the cases associated with autism. A po ssible explanation is that the high fever associated with a reaction to MMR led to the administration of acetaminophen, whose safe di sposal, like that of aluminum, depends on an adequate serum supply of bi o-sulfates. The frequent presence of concurrent aluminum-containing vaccines would cont ribute synergistically to toxicity. We hypothesize that the fever asso ciated with MMR results in th e administration of acetaminophen, which, in conjunction with the in tense immune response to live vi ruses, becomes toxic to the vulnerable child. Most of the symptoms associated with Hep-B administra tion to children under 6 years old are also associated with aluminum-conta ining vaccines in genera l and over all age groups, further bolstering the hypothesis that the aluminum in the vaccine is a major source of toxicity. A strong association between Hep-B and autism also s uggests that aluminum may contribute to autism. Entropy 2012 , 14 2245 This strong association doe s not however exclude mercur y as a contributor to auti sm, given that Hep B has both mercury and aluminum. In fact, mercury and aluminum to gether may be synergistically toxic [113]. If our hypothesis is correct, then it should be rela tively easy and very cost-effective to implement a solution to the problem. Both wo men of childbearing age and child ren should be encouraged to consume foods that are rich in sulfur and to spend c onsiderable time outdoors without sunscreen on sunny days. It might be prudent to implement a screening test for sulf ate and/or glutathione concentration in the blood prior to administration of an aluminum-containing vaccine, and to waive the vaccine or consider a non-aluminum-containing alte rnative if sulfate or glutathione levels are insufficient. A delay by one month of the current practice of Hep-B administration at birth seems warranted. The practice of including aluminum in the so-called \"placebo\" in vaccine trials should be abolished, so that the effects of aluminum adjuvant can be formally measured in a premarket phase. It would also be highly recommended to reconsider wh ether the increased immune response associated with aluminum adjuvant is worth the price in terms of increased risk of adverse reactions. Based upon our statistical research of the VAE RS database, we would encourage the vaccine industry to consider omitting aluminum adjuvant doping of all vaccines for both children and adults. In future work, we plan to create and maintain a web site where users can intelligently search the VAERS database, asking questions in spoken or typed natural lang uage, such as, \"Is there an association between miscarriage and the Gardasil vaccine?\" An intuitive graphical interface will also help users easily find adverse event reports relevant to their personal experiences. This system will be modeled after a similar system we have already c onstructed for prescription drugs [121]. We believe that the VAERS database is a rich resource, many of whose secrets are yet to be revealed. 6. Conclusion In this paper, we have presented some analyses of the VAERS database whic h strongly suggest that the aluminum in vaccines is toxic to vulnerable children. While we have not shown that aluminum is directly causative in autism, the compelling eviden ce available from the literature on the toxicity of aluminum, combined with the evidence we present fo r severe adverse reactions occurring much more frequently following administration of aluminum-c ontaining vaccines as compared to non-aluminum- containing vaccines, suggests that neuronal damage due to aluminum penetration into the nervous system may be a significant factor in autism. Th e fact that mentions of autism rose steadily concomitant with significant incr eases in the aluminum burden in vaccines, is highly suggestive. However, it is possible th at other factors, such as more aggre ssive reporting or simultaneous increases in other environmental toxins, e.g., herbicides or pe sticides, or aluminum in other products such as antiperspirants and antacids, may have contribute d to these observed increases. We also observed a strong correlation between the MMR vaccine and autis m, which we suggest could be explained by the effects of acetaminophen. We have proposed elsewhere that an impairment in cholesterol sulfate synthe sis in the skin and in the vasculature may be causative in autism, and we argue here that vaccines can act synergistically with this impairment in the vulnerable child. We propose that simple correc tive measures such as increased sunlight exposure and decreased use of s unscreen may help protect a child from a severe Entropy 2012 , 14 2246 reaction to aluminum-containing vaccines, but we al so feel that the vaccine industry should find a way to reduce or even eliminate the aluminum content in vaccines.
