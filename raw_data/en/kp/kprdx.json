Throughout the history of Cunningham Children's Home the spiritual nurturing of children and youth has been an integral part of our provision of care. Chaplain Anne Fuquay, our United Methodist Chaplain, is available to the youth, and their families, in our residential treatment program and provides support during times of crisis as well as leadership during times of community celebration. Participation in spiritual services is optional, and services are tailored to the unique needs of individual clients.
