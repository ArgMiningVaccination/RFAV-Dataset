NSCs induce shifts in experiential contents (whatappears to the experiencer) and/or structure (how it appears). This can allow the investigation of the plastic and dynamic nature of experience from a multiscale perspective that includes mind, brain, body, and context. We propose aneurophenomenological (NP) approach to the study of NSCs which highlights their role as catalysts of transformation in clinical practice by rening our under-standing of the relationships between experiential (subjective) and neural dy-namics. We outline the ethical implications of the NP approach for standardconceptions of health and pathology as well as the crucial role of experience-based know-how in NSC-related research and application. Consciousness research and non-ordinary states of consciousness (NSCs) Over the past two decades there has been increased interest in the study of consciousness, but several challenges remain. Obstacles to the study of consciousness include the poor reliability ofnaive experiential rst-person reports [ 1], the inadequacy of (often binary) categorical cognitive taxonomies that poorly capture the breadth, nuances, and dynamic nature of human experience[2], dif culties in establishing the in fluences of culture and context on conscious experience [ 3], and the lack of effective means to study the relationship between the contents and structural fea-tures of conscious experience. These challenges translate to dif culties in studying the relation- ship between experiential (subjective) and neurobiological phenomena [ 4,5]. We present a neurophenomenological (NP) approach which combines rst-person and neuro- physiological data using disciplined methods ( Box 1 ) for the study and understanding of NSCs. We broadly de ne NSCs as experiences that arise spontaneously or are induced by practices and/or rituals, and can have considerable cultur al and eudaimonic (i.e., denoting well-being and meaning in life) signi cance. We prefer here the term 'non-ordinary '(rather than 'altered ') states of consciousness (e.g., [ 6]) because we see these states as expanding the 'experiential repertoire' rather than being intrinsically different (in some fundamental way). NSCs are generally characterised by their transient (or acute) nature (i.e., states), but can also be used to target long- lasting transformation (i.e., traits) by impacting on cognition as well as on physical and mentalhealth. A common feature of NSCs is to induce a shift in the way a subject, embedded in thetaken-for granted world of everyday, usually experiences a speci c content of consciousness, which may be accompanied or caused by a shift in e xperiential structure (e.g., perception of time and/or space, sense of agency and/or ownership). This 'taken-for-granted world ofHighlights Non-ordinary states of consciousness (NSCs) induced by hypnosis, meditation,and psychedelics have become increas-ingly popular in research and clinicalpractice. However, no contemporaryunifying framework has been proposedfor their study. A neurophenomenological (NP) ap- proach for the study of NSCs providesa unique opportunity to rigorously inves-tigate content-based and structural as-pects of consciousness as dynamic(i.e., process-based), together with theirembeddedness at multiple scales com-prising brain, mind, body, and context. We illustrate this by providing examples from research using traditional and NPapproaches regarding the effects of hyp-nosis, meditation, and psychedelics oncore experiences (e.g., agency, pain,and the sense of self) The NP approach to NSCs stresses the importance of experienced-basedknow-how for their research and appli-cation, and has ethical implications re-lated to the traditional conceptions ofhealth and pathology. 1Centre for Psychedelic Research, Division of Psychiatry, Department of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London,London, UK 2Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, UniversityMedical Center Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany 3Coma Science Group, GIGA Consciousness and Centre du Cerveau2, University and University Hospital ofLiege, Belgium Trends in Cognitive Sciences, February 2023, Vol. 27, No. 2 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2022.11.006 139 \u00a9 2023 The Authors.

The framework we outline focuses on three pro minent families of NSC-inducing practices: hypnosis, meditation, and the use of psychedelics. We have chosen these practices because they have received signi cant attention in both contemporary neuroscience and clinical studies. Until now these elds have mostly been studied separately ([ 14-16] for some preliminary compar- ative empirical studies, and [ 17-19] for theoretical work bridging some of these practices), and their respective research practices have consequently developed in different ways. In this integrative review we present a framework that can capture the contribution of the NP approach to the study of NSCs to enrich the eld of consciousness science. We then illustrate this framework with examples of how NSCs make amenable the study of the central features of experience. Finally, we discuss the clinical and ethical implications of this approach. An NP framework for the study of NSCs Our main claim is that the NP approach to the study of NSCs may help to overcome some of the limitations found in the study of consciousness by providing broader and more reliable access tothe richness of content and structure of experience. This approach further advocates incorporat-ing the richness of the anthropological and eudemonic heritage together with NSCs into main-stream consciousness research, and by doing so advancing our understanding of the relationship between experiential, contextual, and neurobiological phenomena. Speci cally, we propose that applying the NP approach to the s tudy of NSCs provides an opportunity toBox 1. The neurophenomenological (NP) approach to NSCs The NP approach [ 4,20] emphasises the careful examination of experience using rigorous rst-person methodologies in- spired by phenomenology [ 99,152] in consciousness research. The central aim of NP is to integrate the phenomenal struc- ture of experience into the characterisation of neural dynamics. During a conventional NSC study, the experimentalist may perturb a particular content and/or structure of consciousness (with the participant self-reporting the NSC using psychomet-ric scales) to identify neural correlates of the NSC. The NP approach to NSCs extends this by actively involving the participantin describing speci c and, arguably, more informative phenomenal invariants of experience. The disciplined process of be- coming re flectively aware of one's experience becomes an explicit part of the experimental protocol ( Figure 1 ). The capacity of the participant for re flexive awareness, utilised by a skillful interviewer, enables access to tacit, preverbal, and prere flective aspects of subjective experience, which otherwise would remain simply 'lived through', thus rendering them de- scribable as processes (i.e., a dynamic interplay of experiential content and structure). An iterative application of the rigorousphenomenological rst-person methods allows the derivation of experiential categories for an empirical investigation using second- and third-person methods [ 20,153]. This in turn allows a more ne-grained characterisation of neural (or psycho- physiological) dynamics, affording explanatory power over what is normally treated as inter- and intra-subjective 'noise'. As an example, a pilot NP study using experienced meditators [ 76] was able to explain the variability in EEG data during the perception of visual stimuli. The source of EEG data variability was found to reside mainly in fluctuations in the cognitive processes of the subject, including the presence of spontaneous thoughts and strategy in performing the task. Thus, by guiding the investigation of brain dynamics using experiential clusters derived from rst-person reports of trained par- ticipants, clear dynamical neural signatures of these clusters emerged, and these accounted for a large amount of variancein the neural cross-trial variability. The introduction of practices involving the systematic training of attention and awareness (i.e., mindfulness meditation) is one strategy to increase the sensitivity of the participants to their own experience from moment to moment [4 ]. This may increase replicability and reduce the known biases of self-reports in the NP research. While the use of participants expe-rienced in accessing and revealing otherwise 'hidden' experiential dynamics is not a hard prerequisite for the application ofNP methods, the application of rigorous interview protocols by a skilled interviewer is essential.4Sensation and Perception Research Group, GIGA Consciousness and Algology Intedisciplinary Center, Univer- sity and University Hospital of Liege,Belgium 5Centre for Psychiatric Research, Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapyand Psychosomatics, Psychiatric Hospital Z\u00fcrich, University of Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland 6Social Neuroscience Laboratory, Max Planck Society, Berlin, Germany 7Division of Psychology, Department of Life Sciences, College of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences, Brunel University London, London, UK 8Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London,London, France 10Equal contributions 11Shared senior authorship Secondary author list for the European Neurophenomenology, Contemplative, and Embodied Cognition Network (ENCECON) Research Montreal,QC H3A 1A1, and Lady Davis Institute in Cognitive Sciences OPEN ACCESS 140 Trends in Cognitive Sciences, February 2023, Vol. 27, No. 2illuminate structural and process-based features of consciousness (e.g., sense of self, experience of pain, agency, etc.) by perturbing these feat ures and thereby making them experientially 'visible', thus allowing descriptions of these features to be made by participants using rigorousresearch protocols ( Box 1 ).

(Ai) The experience of sensory stimulation, for example pain (state A), is perturbed (lightning symbol) during an NSC (state B). The NSC, for example induced using a hypnotic induction, shifts the content of experience (e.g., pain intensity/unpleasantness; xaxis), its structure (e.g., the relationship of the subject with the pain sensation; yaxis), and level/quality of awareness of the pain sensation (zaxis) (the dimensions are illustrative for changes in structures of experience and do not imply orthogonality between them). (Aii) The neural correlates of experiential states A and B capture the content and structure of the ordinary and non-ordinarypain experience. However, without ne-grained rst-person data to elucidate the dynamic changes in the content and structure of experience, it is not possible to differentiate the neural dynamics of content and structure or their interactions. (Bi) An inductionof an NSC complemented by an NP approach ( Box 1) renders dynamic changes in the content and/or structure of experience reflexively accessible and reportable (and potentially reproducible), revealing additional state transitions leading to different ex- periential trajectories (A A1A2B1 vs. AA3 A4B2). For example, an NSC induced by meditation might lead to a heightened re flexive awareness, accompanied by a change in structure (e.g., reduced reactivity) which might in turn lead to a change in content (e.g., negative emotion). (Bii) The rst-person data elucidating the experiential dynamics of content and/or structure changes allow a better understanding of the neural dynamics, affording a greater explanatory power of what is con-ventionally treated as 'inter- and intra- subjective noise' (brain activations shown are arbitrary).Trends in Cognitive Sciences OPEN ACCESS Trends in Cognitive Sciences, February 2023, Vol. 27, No. 2 141stimulation (state A) is transformed in response to a hypnotic suggestion, resulting in changes in the content of the sensation and the structure of the experience (state B) (panel Ai). For instance, apatient following a brief relaxation induction could be invited to visualise themselves in an agree-able location experienced in the past and to reappraise a nociceptive sensation as being onlymildly unpleasant. The neural correlates of this NSC may be probed (panel Aii); however, lacking a rigorous examination of the dynamics of subjective experience does not allow differentiating the corresponding neural dynamics associated with the changes in the content and structure of ex-perience as well as the dynamic interplay between the two. An NP approach ( Figure 1 B) employing rigorous methods of rst-person data collection ov ercomes this limitation by capitalising on the fact that perturbations of 'ordinary' experience by NSC-inducing practicesoffer an opportunity for the individual to become aware of their habitual way to experience andreact to the world. This then reveals the dynamics of both subjective experience (panel Bi) andneural data (panel Bii). The ne-grained analysis of both subjective and neural dynamics of content/structure changes during an NSC also affords greater explanatory power for the variations in the outcome state (states B1 and B2) that normally would be obscured by group-level analysis. Arguably, taking stock of these dynamic ne-grained variations not only advances our understating of experien- tial and neurophysiological processes and their inter-relationships but also allows the develop-ment of more targeted and effective interventi ons for promoting mental health and well-being (discussed in the section 'From states to traits: clin ical, epistemological and ethical implications for NSC practices'). For example, during mindfulness meditation, a practitioner may experience changes in the con- tent and structure of pain. By intentionally anchoring one's attention in the body (i.e., a changein experiencing subject, yaxis in Figure 1 ), the practitioner can more readily become aware of and disidentify with various processes related to nociceptive stimulation, such as anticipatoryanxiety or catastrophising thought processes (i.e., enhanced refl exive awareness, zaxis in Figure 1 ), which may reduce pain unpleasantness (i.e., structural change in the experienced con- tent, e.g., sensory -affective decoupling, xaxis in Figure 1 ). Refl exive awareness here refers to how when one consciously sees an object, one is also at the same time aware -intransitively, prere flectively, and passively -of one's seeing (e.g., [ 20]). This ability is particularly at play during meta-awareness (i.e., explicitly monitoring and noting the current contents of consciousness; de-tails in [ 21]). Through such explicit monitoring of mental processes, the subject helps to guide the scienti c study of these dynamics ( Box 1 ). For example, a recent study [ 22]u s i n g ne-grained rst-person data from mindfulness practitioners during pain experience revealed several experi- ential clusters with differential contents and/or structures. In NSC-inducing practices, becoming aware of content/structure as a process of experience can be achieved by modulating (increasing or decreasing) the level of immersion into content throughintersubjective guidance (e.g., hypnotic sugge stion), metacognitive regulatory strategies (e.g., meditation), or pharmacological agents (e.g., psychedelics) ( Box 2 for de nitions). Although some NSCs may acutely reduce metacognitive processes via modulation of the structural fea-tures of experience (examples of hypnosis and psychedelics are given below), these modulationscan enable the participant to enhance refl exive processes post-factum via disciplined mediation by for example an experienced facilitator [ 23]. By allowing such modulation of immersion into the contents of experience, supported by skilful intersubjective guidance (both within and/or outsidethe acute state of the NSC), the subject may become aware of the process-based nature of ex-perience, leading to insights that might be transformative, potentially enhancing psychologicalwell-being.Trends in Cognitive Sciences OPEN ACCESS 142 Trends in Cognitive Sciences, February 2023, Vol. 27, No. 2By including rigorous rst-person methods, the NP approach to the study of NSCs makes use of the reflexive capacity of the subject (and its modulation) to investigate process-based experiential features and associated neural dynamics, thereby providing gains in the neuroscience of con- sciousness research. Rigorously acquired rst-person data can help to explain inter-and intra- subject 'noise' in third-person neuroimaging data [ 20], which is traditionally dealt with by averag- ing the data across the time-series within and between participants ( Figure 1 andBox 1 ). Perturbing the structures of consciousness during NSCs Although a few NSC studies have implemented explicit NP methods, we rst review research using more traditional approaches to illustrate how structural features of experience can be ame- nable to scienti c inquiry via signi cant perturbations of experience, using commonly studied structural features of experience as examples : the sense of agency, physical pain, and the sense of self. Sense of agency Agency can be de ned as the experience that some intentions and actions are internally gener- ated by the individual, rather than by external objects or other individuals [ 24]. Hypnotic sugges- tions are communications for involuntary experiences (e.g., 'you will be unable to experience anysensation in your arm') that are experienced as if they happen to a person rather than being wilfully authored [ 25,26]. Among individuals displaying high hypnotic suggestibility, suggestions can pro- duce pronounced alterations in the sense of agency, such that behaviours and experiences areBox 2. De nitions of practices and domains Hypnosis Hypnosis is a multifaceted process consisting of \"a state of consciousness involving focused attention and reduced peripheral awareness characterised by an enhanced capacity for response to suggestion\" [ 154] or alternatively is a procedure involving the administration of verbal suggestions [ 26,131]. Hypnosis typically involves an interaction between two individuals in which a hypnotist administers an induction intended to facilitate absor ption in subsequent communications and suspension of critical thinking [ 154], and targeted suggestions tailored to the respective phenomenon under study or for a symptom/condition. It has been used for nearly two centuries in clinical contexts, its main application being in pain management, but it has also been usedfor the treatment of other conditions. Meditation Meditation is a practice that is common to most religious, contemplative, and spiritual traditions. There is a wide variety of meditation practices in Western contexts, generally aimed at familiarising oneself with lived experience, stabilising and clar-ifying the mind, as well as cultivating positive human qualities such as altruism and compassion. This variety of practicesmay also lead to phenomenological and neurobiological differences between them. The main cognitive mechanisms in-volved include meta-awareness, focusing of attention, and cognitive defusion/derei cation for mindfulness-related medi- tation [ 9], and perspective taking, cognitive reappraisal, or socioemotional processes for 'constructive' and analytical practices such as compassion meditation [ 11,155]. Forms of meditation have been adapted to and implemented in clinical settings, such as acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), and compassion-based therapy. There is increasing evidence for psychological, phe-nomenological, and neural effects on several psychological and physical conditions, and these are differentially affectedby different meditation practices [ 108]. Psychedelics Psychedelic substances have been historically used for (at least) hundreds of years in ritual contexts for a variety of different purposes. Psychedelics research was prominent in the 1950s and 1960s, following the accidental discovery of lysergicacid diethylamide (LSD). Their mechanism of action relates primarily to agonism at the serotonin 2A receptor, inducing sig-nicant changes in perception, affect, and cognition without loss of awareness at commonly used doses [ 156]. Psyche- delics may induce visual imagery, somatic effects, increased attribution of meaning, feelings of insight or revelation,positive emotion, and so-called unitive, 'peak' or mystical-type experiences [ 37,157].A surge of interest in psychedelics has occurred in recent decades for their use in consciousness research [ 60,158] and their potential for the treatment of mood, anxiety, and substance-abuse disorders, as well as in promoting general mental health and well-being.Trends in Cognitive Sciences OPEN ACCESS Trends in Cognitive Sciences, February 2023, Vol. 27, No. 2 143often perceived as unintentional and have a considerable sense of automaticity [ 24] by altering the usually perceived source and appraisal of one's behaviour and experience [ 27,28]. Studies of hypnosis suggest that a reduced sense of agency is associated with modulations of activity and connectivity in parietal regions that are commonly involved in sensorimotor congruency pro- cesses. Speci cally, reduced activity in the supramarginal gyrus has been linked to reduced aware- ness during involuntary movements in highly suggestible individuals [ 29], whereas increased activity in the parietal operculum (PO) has been associated with perceived automaticity following a hypnotic induction without targeted suggestions in pa rticipants unscreened for suggestibility ( Figure 2 A), and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) activity has been found to correlate with levels of hypnotisability[30]. Suggested loss of agency (initiation and cont rol) of thought and movement is also associated with reduced activation of the supplementary motor area during targeted suggestions in highly sug-gestible individuals [ 31]. By perturbing the experience of agency, hypnotic suggestions may provide insights into the neurobiological mechanisms linked to this central aspect of conscious experience. Meditation appears to either strengthen or attenuate the sense of agency depending on the med-itation technique employed [ 32,33]. Studies using the classic Libet paradigm have shown that meditators are more aware of their impulses to act than are non-meditators [ 34,35]. Compared to non-meditators, meditators seemed to be aware of subjective concomitants of negative de flec- tions of the slow cortical potentials that precede actions (i.e., button presses), which could re flect the crucial feature of being able to initiate the usually unconscious processes of a voluntary move- ment with awareness [ 35]. On the other hand, styles of meditation emphasising the 'letting-go' of experiences can attenuate the sense of agency and/or ownership [ 36]. Psychedelics appear to diminish the sense of agency acutely, including intentions, thoughts, and imagery [ 37], as well as to induce experiences of 'letting-go' of control pertaining to challenging emotions and thoughts [ 38]. In ritual uses of psychedelic-containing plants, extreme reductions in agency are commonly described during experiences of 'possession' [ 39]. Physical painPain is a multidimensional experience affective-motivational,and cognitive-evaluative dimensions [ 40,41]. A traditional meditative account describes pain as being composed of two distinct 'arrows': an im mediate physical sensation and a secondary (psychological) response linked to negative affect [42 ]. In support of this claim, individuals trained in mindfulness meditation (as secularly de ned) seem to be able to uncouple the immediate pain sensation (e.g., the intensity of pain) from the affective reactivity to it (e.g., pain unpleasantness),allowing the physical component to be fully experienced, but with reduced emotional distress [43], a process that is intimately related to 'cognitive defusion' (the ability to gain psychological distance from internal experiences such as thoughts and feelings [ 44]) (Figure 2 Bi). Overall reductions in pain perception in meditators compared to meditation-naive individuals have been linked to increased activity in the insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, as well as to de-creased activation of the lateral prefrontal cor tex, consistent with the notion that mindfulness meditation may facilitate the regulation of a ffective and cognitive processing during pain [44-46]. Furthermore, sensory-affective decoupling and reduced unpleasantness occurring dur- ing open monitoring meditation have been inversely associated with pain catastrophising scores[47]. This study also reported higher activity in the left anterior insula (aINS) and the anterior mid- cingulate cortex (aMCC) during pain, but decreased activity in these regions and the amygdaladurin gpain anticipation, congruent with another report of a meditation-related decrease in antic- ipatory brain activity ([ 48];cf[46]) (Figure 2Bii). Although pain-related activity in the aINS andTrends in Cognitive Sciences OPEN ACCESS 144 Trends in Cognitive Sciences, February 2023, Vol. 27, No. 2TrendsTrends inin CognitiveCognitive SciencesSciences Figure 2. Effects of non-ordinary state of consciousness (NSC) on structural features of experience and their neuronal counterparts. (A) Hypnosis alters measures related to agency by incr easing feelings of automaticity (i.e., non-voluntary responses to external suggestions) (Ai), which h as been associated with increases in cerebral blood flow (CBF; measured using ASL) in the posterior operculum (Aii) [ 30]. (B) Mindfulness meditation supports a present -centred metacognitive stance that monitors and counteracts pain catastrophising while retaining openness to sensory experience. Instead of being immersed in pain, the prac- titioner becomes aware of their affective and motor reactiv ity to pain as a cognitive process, which induces sensory -affective uncou- pling of the intensity of pain from its unpleasantness, ultimately regu lating (reducing) the latter. Open monitoring medi tation reduces the unpleasantness, but not the intensity of pain, and the duration (short vs. long) of perceived pain for experienced compared to novice meditators [ 106] (Bi). The regulation of pain unpleasantness by experienced meditators has been linked to increased activity (BOLD signal % change) in the anterior insula/salience network [ 47] (Bii). (C) Psychedelics disrupt experiential features associated with the sense of self, described using terms such as 'ego-dissolution' (a relaxation of subject -object distinctions [ 190]) or disembodiment [ 37]. This effect has been uniquely associated with psychedelics compared to cocaine and alcohol ingestion (Figure legend continued at the bottom of the next page.)Trends in Cognitive Sciences OPEN ACCESS Trends in Cognitive Sciences, February 2023, Vol. 27, No. 2 145aMCC normally correlates with pain unpleasantness [ 49,50], this association was not present in meditators, suggesting that a different quality of attention to bodily sensations afforded by mind- fulness changes the structure of physical pain experience by leaving only the rst 'arrow' of bodily sensations, without the second 'arrow' of psycho logical suffering as 'pain' experience, thus allowing it to be experienced as a process (an ever-changing flux of sensations) rather than an af- fectively charged content, namely physical pain. Hypnotic suggestion appears to modulate both sensory and affective components of pain [ 51]. Studies have shown brain changes in response to painful stimulation during hypnosis, including decreases in areas corresponding to the 'pain operculum related to the sensory processing of pain) [ 53], as well as areas related to affective components, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula, hippocampus, hypo-thalamus, and temporal cortex [ 54]. Furthermore, the impact of hypnotic suggestions on pain perception appears to be strongly associated with the modulation of ACC activation and its con-nectivity to areas implicated in nociception 49,55]. These ndings seem to indicate that hypnotic suggestions modulate the structure of pain experience by a process ofdistracting participants away from the pain entirely, whereas meditation changes the structureof pain experience by a process of decoupling sensory from affective components. Studies conducted in the 1960s -1970s, complementing anecdotal reports, suggest that psy- chedelics can reduce chronic pain symptoms associated with phantom limb, cancer, and cluster headaches [ 56,57]. Although the hypothesised mechanisms have been attributed to psycholog- ical (e.g., increased acceptance and agency related to the pain experience, acute modulation ofbodily awareness, and mental imagery) and neural mechanisms (reorganisation of functional con-nectivity patterns, activation of the serotonin-2A receptor), more studies will be necessary to elu-cidate the speci c mechanisms [ 56]. Sense of self The 'self' is a multifaceted construct. Broadly, it includes an immediate sense of being a subject of experience (ownership) and an agent of action (agency) -the 'minimal self' aris ing bodily self-awareness, as well as a temporally exten ded sense of identity that has access to autobio- graphic memories (the 'narrative self') [ 58]. This distinction between the ' minimal' and 'narrative' self is in line with early traditions of meditation stating that the sense of self can be deconstructed into various dimensions or levels [ 59]. Perturbations at varying levels of self-related processing during NSCs may provide clues about the experiential features and neuronal counterparts of variousforms of 'selfhood' [ 17,36,60-62]. Psychedelics appear to reliably disrupt both narrative and minimal self-related aspects, resulting in a ttenuation/dissolution of the subject- object distinction that struc- tures ordinary experience, which is com monly described as 'ego-dissolution' ( Figure 2C) and is with feelings of 'oneness', 'boundlessne ss', or 'unity' that also appear to be central features of so-called 'peak', 'mystical' or 'non-dual' dissolution relates mostly to alterations of [190] (Ci), and has been linked to neurobiological mechanisms implicated in various levels of self-related processing, including alter- ations in the connectivity of nodes pe rtaining to the default mode network (e.g., the parahippocampal gyrus [ 191]) and connectivity within the somatomotor network AI, and secondary sensory cortex; Ump, pain un-pleasantness.Trends in Cognitive Sciences OPEN ACCESS 146 Trends in Cognitive Sciences, February 2023, Vol. 27, No. 2connectivity and activity of nodes of the Default Mode Network (DMN) which has been previously associated with narrative self-related processing [ 65]. Greater reductions in DMN metabolism, oscillatory power, and connectivity between it s main hubs: medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), PCC, and medial temporal areas, as well as decoupling of its activity from other brain networks,have been associated with higher levels of ego-dissolution [ 17,60,66-68]. Complementing these ndings, psychedelics have been found to modulate brain systems implicated in the minimal self, such as multisensory integration, interoception, and sensorimotor as the somatomotor and saliencenetworks, accompanied by associ ated subjective changes in self -other distinction, ego- dissolution, and experiences of disembodiment [ 17,69-71](Figure 2 C). Hypnotic induction without self-targeted suggestions has been shown to modulate some com-ponents of self-awareness, such as mental ease, orientation toward space and time, and self- monitoring [ 24]. Unscreened participants (i.e., not recruited based on individual levels of suggest- ibility) have been found to report an increase in self (internal) awareness and a decrease in external awareness, and the usual switches between the two (internal and external) were found to be de-creased [ 72], whereas highly suggestible individuals typically experience spontaneous reductions in the sense of self following a hypnotic induction [ 73]. Targeted suggestions have been used to successfully induce out-of-body experiences, accompanied by associated deactivations of theTPJ [ 74], indicating alterations in the minimal self [ 75]. Although different meditation practices may differentially modulate the sense of self, mindfulnessmeditation attenuates narrative self-referencing accompanied by associated decreases in DMNactivity and connectivity between its main nodes [ 17,33]. Psychometric questionnaires currently fail to distinguish between alterations in narrative versus minimal self-experience, but the use ofan NP approach has proved fruitful in identifying changes in the minimal self in experienced med-itators (see below). NP studies of NSCs The NP approach extends the contributions of NSCs to the study of consciousness beyond in-vestigating 'state' changes during and/or after perturbation to understanding the dynamic inter-play between the changes in the content and structure of conscious experience and its neuralcounterparts. Whereas the standard approach to the study of NSCs (including studies reviewedabove) commonly relies on average ratings (of one or more categories) over the entire course ofexperience, NP methods incorporate in-depth rst-person data to leverage the possibility of accessing the dynamics of experience. They do so by helping the participant to become awareof the 'how' of the experience either during or after the experience (via the process of evoking or recollecting), thereby enhancing the speci city of the studied phenomena at experiential and neural levels. Although the validity of subjective reports has been debated extensively, advances have been made to improve the quality of experiential data and their inclusion within the NP framework[1,20]. Furthermore, the inclusion of rst-person data has been shown to account for within- and between-subject variability, thereby increasing the speci city of inference regarding cognitive and neural processes [ 76]. Below we give examples of how harnessing the NP approach can advance our understanding ofthe neural dynamics associated with NSCs and aid consciousness studies more generally bymaking meaningful bridges between subjective experience and neural activity as well as helpingto explain intra- and inter-subject 'noise'. We also provide an example of how the use of in-depthTrends in Cognitive Sciences OPEN ACCESS Trends in Cognitive Sciences, February 2023, Vol. 27, No. 2 147phenomenological interview methods can help to generate experiential categories that could then be used in the studies using an NP framework. A real-time neurofeedback fMRI study during focused attention meditation in experienced med- itators with brief subjective reports post-scanning [ 77] revealed intriguing PCC activity dynamics. The effortless resting in undistracted awareness/concentration was associated with PCC deacti-vation, whereas 'efforting' (trying to meditate) and being distracted by spontaneously arising thoughts were associated with PCC activation increases. Notably, when spontaneous thoughtswere arising during meditation but without the meditator being distracted by them (i.e., the med-itator remained in the state of observation/cognitive defusion), PCC activity did not increase. Fur-thermore, this study provided evidence indicating that it is not mind-wandering/spontaneousmentation per se that drives PCC activity up, but instead narrative self-referential thoughts that proliferate with cognitive fusion -a 'sticky self'. Without combining neural data with subjective re- ports by meditators of their experience during scanning, this nuance about the role of PCC inmind-wandering and narrative self-referencing would not have been revealed. An NP study using MEG in experienced meditators [ 78] investigated the states of neural activity associated with the experiential structures of 'timelessness' and 'sp acelessness' and found them to overlap in networks related to the sense of the body, including the PCC, right TPJ, and cerebellum (mainly driven by the theta band). Based on rst-person reports of self-induced time- lessness and spacelessness experiences, the meditators were split into three groups: a both time and space group (BTS) who reported the loss of sense of boundary, a not both time and space (NTS) group who reported no boundary loss, and an out of body experience (OBE) group. Phe-nomenologically guided analysis enabled the dissociation of the three different groups at the neu-ral level. Speci cally, the BTS group showed lower r ight TPJ and insula theta power, accompanied by higher cerebellar activity, than the NTS group, whereas the OBE group wascharacterised by a marked reduction of PCC theta power compared to both the BTS and NTSgroups. The study illustrates the utility of employing an NP approach for characterising the neuraldynamics associated with meditation-induced alterations in the sense of time, space, and body, and shows its utility in dissociating different experiential structures of these experiences at the neural level. Two NP studies employing MEG and in-depth phenomenological interviewing [ 36,79] allowed the classication of mindfulness meditation experience into discrete trials in which various degrees of the experience of sel flessness (ego-dissolution) [ 36] and a sense of boundary [ 79] (i.e., structural features of experience) occurred. This permitted explaining within- and between-subject variabil-ity when determining the neural dynamics associated with the perturbation of the narrative self- awareness, which was linked with attenuated frontal and medial prefrontal gamma band power, and minimal self-awareness, which was linked to the attenuation of beta-band power inthe right inferior parietal areas. The ndings of the MEG studies of meditation using the NP framework [ 36,78,79] are resonant with results from an NP study of the psychedelic N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) [ 80]. The use of in-depth phenomenological interviews allowed the classi cation of the contents of experience (e.g., the visualisation of geometries) into dynamic categories of structural experiential features, which were then linked to speci c neural dynamics. Thus, changes in bodily awareness were in- versely correlated with central and parietal beta-band power, providing further evidence for the involvement of this frequency band in experiences of the minimal sense of self that are requiredfor minimal self-awareness. Furthermore, the intensity of visual imagery was inversely correlatedwith alpha power and positively linked to delta and theta power.Trends in Cognitive Sciences OPEN ACCESS 148 Trends in Cognitive Sciences, February 2023, Vol. 27, No. 2Phenomenological investigation of hypnosis also reveals the dynamic nature of experience follow- ing a hypnotic induction. An NP study involving hypnotic induction without suggestions (neutralhypnosis) with online interviewing [ 81] identi ed categories derived from the contents of the hyp- nosis experience, including structural features of experience such as visual imagery and loss ofagency. Intriguingly, the intensity of imagery experiences inversely correlated with alpha power and positively correlated with delta and theta power in low-hypnotisable individuals. Thus, both psychedelic and hypnosis NP studies were able to disentangle common mechanisms associatedwith visual imagery during NSCs (reductions in alpha power and increases in delta/theta power).Notably, these ndings contribute to the notion that delta power may serve as a marker for con- scious disconnection from the environment (usually via NSCs) rather than being a marker of un-consciousness, as was traditionally thought [ 82]. The nal study to mention, although it does not employ neuroimaging, investigated strategies for pain regulation using in-depth interviewing of experienced meditation practitioners [ 22]. Five broad phenomenological structur es of pain regulation were identi ed, including experiential avoidance, volitional agency di stanciation, positive cognitiv e reappraisal, a non-judgemental metacognitive stance, and an altruistic stance with regards to the pain of others. These phenom-enological structures were validated in a laboratory setting by predicting psychometric scores ofpain perception in the same participants in a pain-induction experiment [ 22]. These phenomeno- logical clusters could form the basis for future NP studies of the neural dynamics during pain reg-ulation when investigating the effects of meditation or more generally. Overall, the above studies illustrate the utility and potential of the NP approach in gaining a more ne-grained understanding of brain function and its relationship to subjective experience as a pro- cess (a dynamic interplay of content and structure) for NSC studies and beyond. They also pro-vide evidence for the notion that deeper (and more reliable) access to subjective experience ispossible, and more re ned rst-person data give greater explanatory power over the variance of neural data that is afforded by the use of psychometric scales. Potential overlaps across different NSCs It is presently largely unknown to what extent different forms of NSC impact on similar or differentexperiential and brain processes (see Outstanding questions ). Some initial work has attempted to bridge these domains. Evidence increasingly suggests that the experience of hypnosis, meditation, and psychedelics have an impact on the DMN. As reviewed above, psychedelics appear to modulate connectivity,activation, spectral power, and entropy-related mechanisms in the DMN hubs, especially in the PCC [ 60,83-88]. Similarly, research on meditation has shown that DMN activity, especially that of mPFC and PCC, is attenuated during forms of meditation that suspend narrative self-related processing [ 89-91]. Finally, hypnosis research has shown that inductions are associated with re- duced activation of the mPFC and functional connectivity between the PCC and the executivecontrol network [ 92], as well as reduced connectivity and /or activity of various DMN nodes [29,93]. Hypnosis studies have found reduced connectivity between the posterior midline and parahippocampal structures of the DMN, comb ined increased co nnectivity between medial-prefrontal and lateral parietal DMN nodes [ 94]. The DMN been implicated in longer-term changes following NSCs. Manualised mindfulnessinterventions appear to induce changes in prefrontal DMN areas, which are associated with nar-rative self-related processes, and in the insula, which is associated with interoception [ 95], as well as functional decoupling between the two [ 95,96]. Similarly, psychedelics appear to induceTrends in Cognitive Sciences OPEN ACCESS Trends in Cognitive Sciences, February 2023, Vol. 27, No. 2 149lasting increased connectivity between some of the DMN nodes and reduced coupling between others, and these changes are associated with improved psychological outcomes [97 ,98]. A recent study [ 15] investigating the synergistic impact of meditation and psychedelics showed decreased decoupling between mPFC and PCC during open awareness meditation two daysfollowing a psilocybin-assisted meditation retreat compared to placebo. This decoupling was linked to higher levels of self-reported ego-dissolution occurring during the retreat. Conversely, increased coupling between mPFC and PCC was seen during the control resting-state condition.These effects predicted positive changes in psychosocial functioning of participants 4 monthslater [ 15]. Psilocybin-assisted meditation practice thus facilitated neurodynamic modulation of self-related networks, thereby underpinning (or enhancing) the process of meditation by actingalong the anterior -posterior DMN connection. These ndings support the view that reduced DMN act ivity and connectivity during NSCs may re flect perturbation of internally orient ed cognitive processes associated with the experience of a temporally extended narrative self, whereas the increased flexibility in DMN connectiv ity after an NSC may relate to trait-like changes that refl ect a form of self-related model/belief updating. This supports the notion, discussed in the literature on the therapeutic use of psychedelics and meditation [ 17,33], that NSCs foster an experiential understanding (insight) that what is ordinarily experienced as a xed content structuring experience (e.g., sense of self) is a fluid, context-dependent process, and this insight may drive the therapeutic (transformative) effects of both psychedelics and me ditation. These studies also importantly highlight a possibility of 'transfer' from acute changes related to an NSC (state) to sus- tained psychological, behavioural, and neural effects (trait), but long er-term neuroimaging studies are necessary to determine the 'longevity' of such transfers. From states to traits: clinical, epistemological, and ethical implications for NSC- inducing practices Processes involved in NSCs are facilitated by a speci c context, which can comprise physical, in- tersubjective, and motivational dimensions ( Figure 3 ), that enables and guides the monitoring and regulation of habitual processes. This context is a central, active ingredient of most NSCs, as reflected in their embeddedness into speci cp r a c t i c e s ,r i t u a l s ,p r o t o c o l s ,a n dt r a d i t i o n s .T h e use of NSCs in indigenous, shamanic, religious, therapeutic, and ritual contexts illustrates the central importance of the speci c forms of know-how that are required for the inquiry into human experience. Broadening this idea, the embedded nature of NSCs requires that methodol-ogies for their study explicitly recognis e and mobilise context and culture-speci cs e t t i n g s (i.e., disciplined forms of know-how) in contemporary scienti c settings. This emphasises the pragmatic role of rst-person (e.g., speci c meditation practices) or second-person intersubjec- tive methods to guide the study of NSCs ([ 80,81,99-101] for examples), or to apply them in a therapeutic context [ 102,103]. Consequently, an NP approach to NSC involves characterising the interplay between brain, body, and environ ment at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and thus provides an opportunity to approach the study of consciousness beyond identifyingmere brain-bound correlates. Furthermore, the scienti c investigation of NSCs may provide insights into human consciousness by expanding the validated knowledge of the experiential repertoire available to human beings be- yond a simpli ed unidimensional conception of the presence versus absence of consciousness [104,105]. This broadening has epistemological and ethical implications by extending current def- initions of normality of cognitive constructs and their boundaries. This is consistent with a pertur-bational approach to the study of consciousness, the focus of which is not only the biologicalhuman organism and its physical environment but also its experience and the wider intersubjec-tive context in which the embodied organism is embedded [ 59].Trends in Cognitive Sciences OPEN ACCESS 150 Trends in Cognitive Sciences, February 2023, Vol. 27, No. 2TrendsT rends inin CognitiveCognitive SciencesSciences Figure 3. Embedded and ethical nature of non-ordina ry states of consciousness (NSCs) across multiple temporal and spatial scales. (Ai) An ordinary experience (in purple, e.g., the sense of self) and its disruption (in red) ts within a standard appraisal of healthy and pathological states (e.g., depersonalisation disorder). (Aii) This taxonomy then guides cultural and ethical representations, as well as clini cal decision-making (e.g., a binary separation between health (purple) and pathology (red) categories/biomarkers). (Bi) NSCs are interdependent with larger contextual variables (includingpersonal and cultural factors, determining speci c practices or rituals). NSCs across time can transform from states into traits (e.g., personality changes) and in fluence background contextual variables (e.g., cultural and scienti c knowledge), which in turn in fluence NSC experiences, recursively. The experience of ego-dissolution can be a target state of speci c NSC-inducing practices, and as such are not problematic within that speci c context, but without such a context the same experiences can be highly disruptive. Within an NSC session, the participant can start on the left of the state space, then go to the right andreturn (represented by a Lorenz attractor to emphasise the non-linear dynamics of experience). (Bii) Such broadening ofexperiential repertoires has consequences for the individuals as well as for cultural and ethical de nitions of normality, as illustrated by a dimensional and context-dependent approach to health and disease. (C) During an NSC, the mobilisationof context (symbolised as a perturbation of state A1) may be performed by an experienced facilitator, fostering the develop-ment of alternative experiential trajectories (state C), which can result either in enhanced well-being or 'impairment', both ofwhich are de ned relative to wider cultural norms. Abbreviations: NSC, non-ordinary state of consciousness; OSC, ordinary state of consciousness.Trends in Cognitive Sciences OPEN ACCESS Trends in Cognitive Sciences, February 2023, Vol. 27, No. 2 151Personality traits and clinical outcomes related to NSCs An experience-based approach to the study of NSCs (such as the NP approach) experimentallyassesses these phenomena at multiple scales, including acute experiences (states), long-term ef-fects (traits), and their embeddedness in the context and culture in which they occur ( Figure 3 ). We brie fly review evidence of NSC-related effects on personality and clinical outcomes. Cross-sectional evidence indicates a relationship between meditation expertise or trait measuresof meditation and various personality traits. For instance, expert meditators show less tendencyfor pain catastrophising than novices [ 106], and lower levels of suspiciousness and social anxiety [107]. Evidence from a longitudinal study shows that naive meditators reported changes after 9 months of intense daily meditation practice in a variety of trait measures of emotion regulationand coping styles, as well as in self-reported compassion and mindfulness [ 108]. Similarly, the use of psychedelics has been associated with increases in the personality domains of 'openness to experience' [ 109] and 'agreeableness', alongside decreases in 'neuroticism' [ 110], and a sin- gle psychedelic experience has been found to have lasting effects in worldviews and perceptions of reality [ 111]. Finally, some research suggests that training can be used to increase hypnotic suggestibility [ 112], which predicts responsiveness to hypnotic interventions for reducing pain in clinical and experimental contexts [ 113,114]. Furthermore, NSC-related changes have been associated with bene cial clinical outcomes across a variety of psychiatric conditions, including depression [ 115 -118 ], anxiety [ 119 -121], ad- diction [ 119,122 -124 ], and pain-related conditions [ 56,106,113], as well as reduced stress and increased well-being in clinical and healthy populations [ 38,125]. These ndings suggest that NSC-inducing states and practices, despite their different origins, may be ef cacious in alleviating a broad range of aspects of human suffering as well as in promoting human flourishing ( Box 3 ). We speculate that these broad transformative effects of NSCs could re flect a general form of model (or belief) updating of maladaptive self-schemas mediated by the meta-cognitive and re-flexive processes cultivated by these practices ([ 11,126,127] for similar formulations of the same idea). Importantly, preliminary ndings suggest that the degree to which NSCs can induce favourable clinical outcomes is crucially dependent on the context (next section). The role of context and know-how in NSCs NSCs are embedded and in fluenced by contextual and/or environmental factors, which are likely to play a major role in the access, maintenance, and experiential features of the NSC, as well asthe impact that the NSC will have on traits or clinical outcomes. This is naturally complemented bythe NP approach which considers in fluences beyond the central nervous system (i.e., body, and environment) to be fundamental for the study of consciousness [ 4], and thus attributes a crucial role to context. Figure 3 illustrates various internal and external factors that may constitute the context of an NSC- induci ngsession . These factors can be broadly divided into internal ('set') and external ('setting') factors ( Figure 3 B). The former pertains to facets such as the psychological state and traits of the individual before, during, and after a session (including the 'integration' of the experience into daily life), and the latter refers to aspects such as the physical environment, where a session takes place, the role of other participants, the presence and skill of the facilitator or therapist, as well as wider cultural and historical variables [ 128 -131]. For example, evidence indicates that the capacity to respond to hypnotic suggestions is a traitwith ~10 -15% of the population displaying high hypnotic suggestibility [ 132]. ResponsivenessTrends in Cognitive Sciences OPEN ACCESS 152 Trends in Cognitive Sciences, February 2023, Vol. 27, No. 2to suggestion is additionally infl uenced by expectations, the speci city of the suggestions, meta- awareness of the adequacy and appropriateness of responses during the session, the goals and motivations of the participants to respond, involvement in suggested images, and, nally, rapport with the hypnotist [ 131]. The outcomes of meditation appear to be in fluenced by psychological dispositions, the posture of the participant, and other contextual elements. For example, differ-ences in prosocial behaviour were observed when comparing mindfulness training in combina-tion with ethical teachings on virtuous human qualities with mindfulness training not involvingthese teachings [ 133]. Acute effects (e.g., visual and mystical-type) and bene cial clinical out- comes of psychedelic use appear to be predicted by baseline levels of trait 'openness to experi-ence', trait absorption (related to the tendency to be immersed in mental imagery and hypnoticsuggestibility), and readiness to 'surrender' to the experience [ 38,128], as well as the speci c choice of music during a psychedelic session [ 134]. These ndings highlight the intimate relation- ship between the skillful manipulation of context and clinical outcomes associated with the NSC-inducing practices. The impact of contextual variables on NSCs is w ell described in the humanities but remains under-studied empirically [ 135]. This omission may re flect the initial focus (or bias) of modern treatment applications on cognitive processes or health-related outcomes rather than on contex- tual factors such as ethics, speci c world-views and/or the spiritual lineage surrounding a practice [23,136]. The in fluence of wider contextual variables is of importance when considering the phe- nomenological features of speci c NSCs since these appear to be highly susceptible to the his- torical and cultural framework in which they are embedded. For example, the use of well-dened practices, protocols, and/or rituals is the basis of practices related to hypnosis [137, 138], meditation [ 139,140], and contemporaryBox 3. Clinical ndings Hypnosis Hypnosis has been increasingly proposed to patients (chronic pain, oncology, severely burned, phobic, during surgery, etc.) as a means to re-engage their cognitive resources and capacities to modulate pain and emotional distress and to improvetheir treatment and recovery of well-being [ 159 -161]. The main clinical application of hypnosis concerns acute and chronic pain relief [ 113, 114]; however, positive effects have also been observed for the treatment of depressive [ 162], anxiety [121,163], and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms [ 164], as well as for smoking cessation [ 165]. Historically, hypnosis has been used in conjunction with other psychotherapeutic interventions (e.g., psychoanalysis and cognitive-behaviouraltherapy), as well as with mindfulness-based interventions [ 166] and psychedelics [ 18]. Meditation The use of mindfulness and compassion-based meditation has become widespread in Western societies in education, politics, and the health sector. Mindfulness- and compassion-based interventions have been used to reduce stress inhealthy individuals [ 125], as well as to improve quality of life in a wide variety of clinical conditions such as chronic pain [167], depression, anxiety, addictions [ 119], and oncology [ 168]. It appears to have a bene cial effect on these conditions by improving emotion regulation and decreasing rumination, as well as by providing opportunities for the individual to dis-engage (decentre) [ 12] from being immersed in feelings and/or thoughts. Psychedelics Preliminary trials suggest that psychedelics (in conjunction with psychological support) may induce lasting reductions in the symptoms of depression and anxiety in those with a diagnosis of major depression [ 116,169 -171,192] anxiety [ 172,193], and in terminally ill patients with psychological distress [ 120,173]. Psilocybin was found to induce comparable reductions in depression symptoms when compared to a (gold standard) pharmacological (escitalopram) treatment [ 115]. In addition, signi cant reductions in drinking and smoking have been found in patients following psilocybin administration accompanied by psychological support [ 123,174]. Recent ndings suggest that psychedelics may have enduring positive effects on well- being, prosociality, and nature-connectedness [ 38,175]. These effects on mental health are thought to arise from both expe- riential (e.g., mystical-type, emotional, or psychological insight episodes) and neurobiological plasticity mechanisms [176 -180].Trends in Cognitive Sciences OPEN ACCESS Trends in Cognitive Sciences, February 2023, Vol. 27, No. 2 153contexts. The function of rituals in conjunction with a speci c practice or substance might induce, enhance, direct, or maintain a state of consciousness ( Box 4 and Outstanding questions). Ethical implications The contextual character of NSCs may have relevant ethical implications associated with concep- tions that explicitly or implicitly underlie the medical taxonomy of health and pathology. For exam- ple, psychedelics (previously referred to as psy chosis-mimicking or psychotomimetic states) have been used experimentally as models for psychotic symptomatology, and have provided in-sights into the role of the serotonin system in schizophrenia and associated disorders [ 142]. In- deed, in some instances NSCs may lead to undesirable mental health consequences such asanxiety and other detrimental clinical outcomes [ 23,143]. At the same time, the experiences in- duced by psychedelics are associated with increases in well-being and alleviation of a range ofpsychiatric conditions ( Box 3). This seeming paradox [ 144] suggests that the association of these states with health or pathology (well-being or suffering) is highly dependent on the contex-tual variables and appraisals surrounding a given NSC [ 145](Box 4 ). Similarly, the evidence sug- gests that appraisals of psychotic experiences may be key determinants of the psychologicaldistress and the need for clinical care in people diagnosed with psychotic conditions [ 146]. Importantly, further e thical implications concern the explicit consideration of the role of experience-based know-how to complement empir ical-based interventi ons, given that this helps to foster safety and desirable outcomes in practices employing NSCs. Examples of Box 4. Evidence for the impact of context on NSCs Hypnosis Responsiveness to hypnotic suggestions is facilitated by trait factors (hypnotic suggestibility, expectations), meta-awareness of the adequacy and appropriateness of responses, the goals and motivations of the participants to respond, and rapportwith the hypnotist [ 131]. The use of the terms 'hypnosis' or 'altered state' can increase or decrease (depending on the con- text) the responsiveness to suggestions, as compared to other terms (e.g., relaxation) [ 131,181], even in the absence of for- mal induction procedures. However, de ning hypnosis as an altered state of consciousness may reduce the expectations of participants for treatment outcomes because of popular misconceptions about hypnosis. Verbal suggestions (without an in-duction) can alone be effective in modulating consciousness in highly suggestible individuals [ 182], and thus the incorporation of suggestion into other treatments represents a potential ef cacious avenue for future research. Meditation For mindfulness and compassion-based meditation, preliminary research indicates that expectations and motivation ap- pear to be important contributors to their therapeutic effect in clinical populations [ 130], as well as the relationship between the teacher and the group [ 183 -185]. Meditation practices with different instructions have been found to have a differential effect on phenomenological, interoceptive, prosocial, and behavioural variables [ 108]. Furthermore, increased cortical thickness has been found in prefrontal regions for attention-based practices, increased plasticity in parietal andfrontoinsular areas for socioaffective practices, and incr eased thickness in inferior frontal and temporal regions for sociocognitive practices [ 108]. Psychedelics Psychedelic effects and outcomes in psychedelic-based therapy appear to be highly in fluenced by individual and contextual variables, including the physical, social, and cultural context, as well as by the baseline psychological (and neurobiological) states of the individual [ 128,129]. For example, an environment that provides feelings of safety, and skillful facilitation by a guide or therapist, appears to be crucial for safety and ef cacy [ 129,141]. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the use of particular musical styles in psychedelic sessions favour experiences conducive to reductions in depression [ 134,186]. Base- line traits of absorption and 'openness to experience', as well as a psychological state of acceptance and 'surrender' have been linked to unitive experiences and enduring positive effects on mental health, whereas baseline levels of 'neurot-icism' and psychological states of apprehension and confusion have been linked to challenging acute reactions[38,128,187]. Similarly, baseline br ain function (power of theta waves) and m orphology (cortical thickness of the PCC) may also be related to mystical-type states and chan ges in traits that have been attributed to psychedelics [188,189].Trends in Cognitive Sciences OPEN ACCESS 154 Trends in Cognitive Sciences, February 2023, Vol. 27, No. 2traditional, indigenous, and shamanic practices re flect the value of experience-based know-how when handling these practices safely and effectively [ 23,147- 149]. This point is illustrated in Figure 3 , where NSC-related practices are organically embedded in speci c cultural and historical contexts in the form of a lineage or best clinical practices, and the role that the guidance by a skilled therapist or facilitator (a social actor occupying a second-person intersubjective position) may have during a session. For instance, the rapid expansion of mindfulness-based interventions was followed by the development of assessments of intervention integrity procedures to warrantthe replication and validity of these programs [ 150]. Validation procedures may also follow infor- mal paths of development: the development of many NSC therapeutic techniques is built uponthe accumulation of practices used in indigenous, traditional, and/or contemporary therapeuticcontexts [ 23,147,148]. There is now also explicit guidance to reduce harm and negative side ef- fects in these practices (e.g., [ 141,151]). Concluding remarks Given the paucity of integrative research into NSCs, many questions remain open regarding theextent of overlap across NSCs in terms of experiential and neural dynamics, their 'place' in thecurrent theories of consciousness, the nature of the relationship between states and traits/clinicaloutcomes, and the interdependence of NSCs and the contexts in which they occur (see Outstanding questions). Although these questions remain a future research objective, we believethat the approach we propose could render the relationship between experiential and neurobio-logical counterparts of consciousness more accessible, falsi able, and possibly reproducible, thereby signi cantly advancing the eld of consciousness research.
