Chinese Medicine Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has existed for over 4000 years and is a comprehensive medical system with its own principles, diagnostic methods and therapies. TCM views the body as an organic whole with a network of meridians connecting and co-ordinating the internal organs, Qi (\"vital energy\"), blood, body fluids, muscles, bones, tendons and the skin. TCM also holds as its central belief that health in all parts of the body is due to the relative balance of Yin and Yang. Yin-Yang theory forms the basis of TCM's holistic approach to health and disease and also offers practical guidance in the prevention and management of diseases. TCM has two basic components - Chinese Herbal Therapy and Acupuncture. The aim of Chinese Herbal Medicine and Acupuncture is to regulate the meridians or channels of the body to unblock the stagnation of Qi, as it believes that disease is caused by these energy blockages within the body. The channels are related to the internal organs, which if out of balance is another important factor in the cause of disease. Chinese Herbal Medicine and Acupuncture are used to correct this imbalance. Chinese Medicine is therefore a truly holistic form of medicine, aiming at treatment of the whole body rather than just the symptoms. Can Chinese Medicine Help You?
