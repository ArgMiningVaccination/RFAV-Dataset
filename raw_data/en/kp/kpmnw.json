Even a crystal gets around! If you purchase a crystal from a local shop, it's not hard to speculate the places and people it's come across along the way. Many shop owners purchase crystals from around the globe. The one you buy may have been dug up in the Philippines from miles underground. It passed through several hands, making its way simply to the airplane. It was unloaded, photographed, packaged, and resold in bulk. Every single place and the person it came in contact with affected its energy. By the time your crystal, at last, reaches your warm embrace, it's had quite a long and tiring journey. Its energetic vibration needs to be rebalanced, and any negative energy it has absorbed needs to be cleared, restoring its natural energy. Below, I've organized my six favorite methods for not only clearing but charging crystals. It's important to note that crystals can be damaged if not properly cared for. For example, certain crystals are delicate or porous and should never come in contact with water or any other liquid. It's also worth mentioning that various crystals are light sensitive. Amethyst is a great example as its vivid purple color will fade if exposed to sunlight. "}
