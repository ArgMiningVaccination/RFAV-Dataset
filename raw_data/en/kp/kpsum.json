[[2]](#cite_note-pubchem-2) It is a colorless to pale yellow, aromatic oily liquid extracted from certain [essential oils](/wiki/Essential_oil) in of 80-90% in clove bud oil and at 82-88% in clove leaf oil. [[7]](#cite_note-herbmed-7) Eugenol has a pleasant, spicy, [clove](/wiki/Clove)-like scent. [[8]](#cite_note-8) The name is derived from Eugenia caryophyllata, the former Linnean nomenclature term for cloves. The currently accepted name is Syzygium aromaticum.

[oxygen](/wiki/Oxygen) to methylate caffeic acid, forming [ferulic acid](/wiki/Ferulic_acid), which is in enzyme (CAD) or [sinapyl-alcohol alcohol is then converted to an [ester](/wiki/Ester) in the presence of the substrate CH3COSCoA, forming coniferyl acetate. Finally, coniferyl acetate is converted to eugenol via the enzyme Like many other anesthetic agents, these 2-alkyl(oxy)phenols act as positive allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor. Although eugenol and thymol are too toxic and not potent enough to be used clinically, these findings led to the development of 2-substituted phenol anesthetic drugs, including [propanidid](/wiki/Propanidid) (later withdrawn) and the widely used [propofol](/wiki/Propofol). [[12]](#cite_note-12) Eugenol and the structurally similar [myristicin](/wiki/Myristicin), have the common property of inhibiting [MAO-A](/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_A) and [MAO-B](/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_B) in vitro. [[13]](#cite_note-pmid15936201-13) [[14]](#cite_note-essentialoilsafety-14) In humans, complete excretion occurs within 24 hour Eugenol is used as a flavor or aroma ingredient in teas, meats, cakes, [perfumes](/wiki/Perfume), [cosmetics](/wiki/Cosmetics), [flavorings](/wiki/Flavoring), and [essential oils](/wiki/Essential_oil).

For persons with a [dry socket](/wiki/Dry_socket) as a complication of tooth extraction, packing the dry socket with a eugenol-zinc oxide paste on iodoform gauze is effective for reducing acute pain. [[20]](#cite_note-20) Eugenol-zinc oxide paste is also used for root canal sealing. [[21]](#cite_note-Ferracane-21) Insects and fish[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Eugenol&action=edit\u00a7ion=5)] It is attractive to males of various species of [orchid bees](/wiki/Orchid_bee), which apparently gather the chemical to synthesize [pheromones](/wiki/Pheromone); it is commonly used as bait to attract and collect these bees for study. [[22]](#cite_note-22) It also attracts female [cucumber beetles](/wiki/Cucumber_beetle). [[23]](#cite_note-23) Eugenol and [isoeugenol](/wiki/Isoeugenol), which both are floral volatile scent compounds, are catalyzed by a single type of enzyme in the genus [Gymnadenia](/wiki/Gymnadenia) and the gene encoding for this enzyme is the first functionally characterized gene in these species. [[24]](#cite_note-Gupta-24) Eugenol is an ingredient in some [insecticides](/wiki/Insecticide). [[2]](#cite_note-pubchem-2) Clove oil is common as an anesthetic for use on aquarium fish as well as on wild fish when sampled for research and management purposes. [[25]](#cite_note-25) [[26]](#cite_note-26) Where readily available, it presents a humane method to euthanize sick and diseased fish either by direct overdose or to induce sleep before an overdose of eugenol.

[[32]](#cite_note-32) Eugenol is a component of [balsam of Peru](/wiki/Balsam_of_Peru), to which some people are allergic.
