Members of Native American tribes live throughout the country. \"There are an estimated 4.9 million persons, in 565 federally recognized tribes who are classified as American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AI), alone or in combination with one or more other designated racial classifications. This demographic group compromises 1.6% of the U.S. population\" (Horowitz, 2012). Wisconsin is home to the Ho-Chunk (Winnebago), Ojibwa (Chippewa), and the Potawatomi tribes (\"American\", 2014). It is important for nurses within this state, as well as any other state, to understand the Native American belief system in order to provide a quality healthcare experience. Nurses are the primary point of contact in the healthcare setting. Client advocacy is one of the nurse's major roles. Therefore, the nurse should have the highest level of diversity understanding for the cultures within the local region. Traditional Cherokee medicine primarily focuses on the purity and wellbeing of the soul and assesses the physiological condition of the body as a secondary practice (Frazier, Goad, & Wolyniak, 2013). The Cherokee highly value the importance of man being in a harmonious balance with nature. An imbalance in nature is erosion of the Aboriginal culture.(chp.2). Restrictions placed on the cultural practices of the Aboriginal people ultimately led to the abatement of the Aboriginal traditional medicines.(p88). Losing their freedom to practice traditional therapeutics, the Aboriginal people eventually had to adapt to the culturally inappropriate ways of western medicines. The purpose of this paper is to examine the advantages of Aboriginal healing methods for the Aboriginal people, as well as to explain why these traditional methods continued to persist long after western style medicines were introduced. The Sin Nombre virus is found in deer mice, common in the Southwestern part of the United States. This virus is not new to the area but the particular strain that caused the outbreak in 1993 was a new strain to the area. The Native Americans in the area have Native American medicine is an umbrella term that encompasses the healing beliefs and practices of all the indigenous people of North America. Its' therapeutic approach combines spirituality, herbalism, and magic in treating a wide range of physical and emotional ailments from the common cold to depression. Native Americans and Their Contributions to the Advancement of Health and Medicine Stories of Native Americans contributions to the advancement of health and medicine traces were discovered in a small town in Nali, Africa. The very first onset of the beggining of modern pharmacology is the substance called \"quinine\". This is the substance that came from a bark of a tree that grew in high elevations. The Indians has been using this substance to cure malaria, cramps, chills, hear-rythm disorders and many other ailments. Prior to the disovery of quinine, the old world suffers enormously because the lack of medical knowledge that the old world posess. Quinine would have probably been introduce somewhere in 1630, as it was mention in Since many Native Americans (American Indians; Indigenous peoples; First Nations) integrate traditional healing practices with Western biomedicine, it is important to gain the views of Indigenous men healers. This is particularly true because of the differences between Indigenous healing and Western Rights of a Patient The physician-patient relationship has greatly evolved in the twenty-first century when compared to previous centuries in which the Hippocratic Oath and not patient's rights was the forerunner of the medical system. The shift to a balanced physician-patient relationship has entailed more rights for patients, such as less abortion restrictions and physician-assisted suicide. As patients obtained more medical rights, individuals explored more nontraditional medical practices as a way to heal. As a result, alternative medicine gained a lot of traction. However, homeopathy, a prominent alternative medicine treatment, has received a great amount of resistance. Within this practice doctors believe the use of \"large doses of a Diseases occur as a result of supernatural powers, such as witches, idols and ancestral spirits. The traditional healer must use herbal concoctions and invoke the ancestral spirits or deities in order to treat diseases... Advanced medicine has it's advantages, but the medicine today mimics the characteristics of plants used to help people way before man-made treatments. Herbal remedies don't have many of the side effects drugs have today. Looking into the roots of herbal medicine can make modern medicine more effective, safer, and healthier No Wonder Patients are Looking For Another Way! There is a lot of controversy around whether you should use alternative medicine to deal with a health issue or whether you should stick with Western Medicine. When it comes to traditional medicine, it doesn't always work and there isn't always a scientific reason to prove it. There is no perfect medical solution in our world. When traditional medicine fails patients, many physicians believe that prescribing alternative forms of medicine is more harmful than not prescribing them at all, due to the supposed lack of evidence of their effectiveness. In this case, patients have no other options for treatment. However, research has shown that there is a significant amount of evidence that supports the effectiveness of alternative medicines. Alternative medication therefore should be presented to these in dire need as a legitimate and potentially effective form of treatment. Medicine practices and traditions varies so widely among different cultures. Western medicine for instance is based purely in science and illness usually are caused by germs, poor diet, or even DNA. On the other hand, traditional medicine usually involves cleanings, prayer, or herbal treatments for illnesses that may be caused by bad spirits, punishments from god, curses, or guilt for doing something wrong. There are also many types of approaches to healing people in the traditional cultures, which can be broken into two categories, Natural Traditions and Magico-Religious Traditions. Natural traditions view illnesses as being caused by biological or stress-related phenomena, poor habits or punishment from god and treatments usually involve the use of herbs to provide remedies or going to church regularly. Magico-Religious Traditions view illnesses as a result of bad or evil spirits, and can be treated through the use of ancient rituals, exorcisms, pilgrimages and prayer (Spector, 2004). In the present day, medical practice has been regarded as dichotomized in the sense that, they are either categorized as \"conventional or alternative\" hence their medical backgrounds and respective practitioners many times are dependent against each other. A close observation shows that these categorizations are subjective and not made to conflict. Conventional medicine have formerly been known to utilize natural resources while home remedies have for a long period been prepared using a boost of untested value as they are administered without professional supervision or prescription (Hassed, 405). Traditional health care system may also integrate harmful traditional practices or at least trust in the importance of such practices. Therefore educating the traditional practitioners in specific and the community in general is significant (Addis et al., 2002). Even though traditional health schemes are locally manageable and culturally pertinent, they "}
