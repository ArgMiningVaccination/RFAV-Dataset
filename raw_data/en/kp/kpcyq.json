See the [CDC's website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/proof-of-vaccination.html#covid-vaccines)for more details. - Foreign travelers who are fully vaccinated must also show a negative test administered no more than 3 days before boarding. Testing requirements include all travelers: U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs), and foreign nationals. - Unvaccinated travelers, whether they are U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, or the small number of excepted unvaccinated foreign nationals, will need to show documentation of a negative test administered no more than 1 day prior to boarding. - For more information, visit [travel.state.gov](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/covid-19-faqs-for-travel-to-the-us-information.html). Q&A Q: Who will need to submit their vaccination status? - Fully vaccinated U.S. citizens and LPRs will continue to be required to show documentation of a negative viral test from a sample taken up to 3 days before departure to the United States. They must present proof of vaccination to qualify for the 3-day test window. - U.S. citizens and LPRs who are unable to present proof of full vaccination will have to show documentation of a negative viral test taken no more than 1 day before departure. - For foreign nationals, proof of vaccination will be required - with very limited exceptions - prior to departure to the United States. Q: What must passengers provide to airlines to show that they are fully vaccinated? - Both U.S. citizens and foreign nationals who are fully vaccinated must travel with proof of their vaccination status to provide to their airline prior to boarding. - Proof of vaccination must be a paper or digital record issued by an official source (e.g., public health agency, government agency) and must include the traveler's name and date of birth, as well as the vaccine product and the date (s) of administration of all the doses you received. Q: What vaccines will be accepted? - The CDC has determined that, for travel to the United States, accepted vaccines will include those approved or authorized by the FDA and those listed on the World Health Organization (WHO) Emergency Use List (EUL). Currently, this list includes Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson; but also vaccines like AstraZeneca and Sinovac which have WHO EUL. See the [CDC's website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/proof-of-vaccination.html#covid-vaccines)for more details. Q: What are the requirements for minors? - Those under 18 years of age are exempt from the vaccination requirement given the ineligibility of the youngest for vaccination, as well as the global variability in access to vaccination for older children who are eligible to be vaccinated. - Children between the ages of 2 and 17 must take a pre-departure test. - If a minor is not fully vaccinated and is traveling with a fully vaccinated adult, they can show documentation of a negative test on a sample taken within 3 days prior to departure (according to the fully vaccinated adult schedule). - If an unvaccinated minor is traveling alone or with unvaccinated adults, they will need to show proof of a negative viral test from a sample taken within 1 day before departure. - While children under the age of 2 are exempt from the testing requirement, the CDC recommends a pre-departure test for these children whenever possible. Q: What does it mean to take the test 3 days before departure? - The test must be administered no more than 3 calendar days prior to the date of the international flight to the United States. - Therefore, if a traveler leaves for the United States at 10 p.m. on January 19, they would have to submit a negative result for a test that was taken at any time after 12:01 p.m. on January 16.
