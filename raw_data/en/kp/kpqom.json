Dr. Andrew Simon was voted [Seattle Met Top Doctor 2017](https://rebelmednw.com/dr-andrew-simon-named-seattle-met-top-doctor-2017-naturopathic-medicine/), [Seattle Met Top Doctor 2018](https://rebelmednw.com/seattle-top-doctor-2018/), [Seattle Met Top Doctor and [Seattle Met Top Doctor 2020](https://rebelmednw.com/2020/05/rebel-med-nw-seattle-met-top-doctor-2020/) for [Naturopathic Medicine](https://rebelmednw.com/services/naturopathic-medicine/). Rebel Med NW has become a staple of Ballard having supported the growth of several additional physician practices having been named Seattle Met Top Doctor 7 years in a row, 2017-2023, after having survived the pandemic and both covid-19 tests, while performing over 2500 covid-19 vaccines, and boosters for the community. Credentials Dr. Andrew Simon was voted [Seattle Met Top Doctor](https://rebelmednw.com/2020/05/rebel-med-nw-seattle-met-top-doctor-2020/) 4 years in a row during the early years of building out Rebel Med NW to be the integrative medical office it is today. Dr. Andrew Simon is a licensed naturopathic physician and functional doctor that utilizes evidence-based practices from both traditional and integrative medicine principles. Naturopathic Physicians are considered the first \"Functional Medicine\" Physicians as they truly use physiology, science, and biochemistry, along with the power of nutrition, mind-body medicine, and natural therapeutics to create a more sustainable medicine approach versus a disease-centric medical model. A graduate of [Bastyr University](http://www.bastyr.edu/), resident of [Bastyr Center for Natural Health](https://bastyrcenter.org/), and current Adjunct Clinical Supervisor for Bastyr University, Dr. Andrew Simon not only teaches his patients, but also several students and residents since graduating in 2013. His experiences shine from the integration of [Primary Care](https://rebelmednw.com/naturopathic-medicine/), [Physical Medicine](https://rebelmednw.com/pain-and-physical-medicine/), and [Mind-Body Medicine](https://rebelmednw.com/biofeedback-mind-body-medicine/). Biofeedback - BCIA Board Certified Dr. Andrew Simon is board certified by the BCIA as a biofeedback therapist. He has been using biofeedback as a form of treatment since 2011 in his early days as a student clinician mentoring under Dr. Brad Lichtenstein, ND, BCB. Using an awareness-driven CBT approach, Biofeedback is about understanding the signals of your physiology and how they represent your body's natural response to stress. By being aware of how your breath affects your heart rate, or how your mind can affect the temperature of your extremities, Dr. Andrew Simon guides his patients through mindful approaches to managing anxiety, depression, PTSD, ADHD, trauma, and anger. A sustainable practice designed to help patients transition to a more resilient and robust nervous system capable of moving through various stages of life and the challenges it brings to our own sense of self, relationships with others, and how we orient to the world we live in. Creating Rebel Med NW Creating Rebel Med NW with his partner in life and business, [Dr. Phonexay Lala Simon, EAMP, LAc](https://rebelmednw.com/staff-member/phonexay-lala-simon-eamp-lac/) was a dream from the beginning of when they first met. When they had the opportunity to join forces officially in 2018 to create Rebel Med NW after running their individual practices side by side, they had a vision for what medicine could be, patient service driven with recognition of how mental and behavioral health played such a significant role in creating real sustainable health changes. Raising 2 kids in the process of running a small business, and surviving a pandemic, Dr. Andrew & Dr. Phonexay live and work in Ballard, and know what it takes to really find balance in the things we love and do, at least we try every day, and are real with our patients along the way. Clinical Philosophy Taking an initial intake with a new patient is more than just intake forms, it is about finding what goals a patient has to really take their health to the next level out of the disease models of care our traditional medical systems manage. Using a [mind-body](https://rebelmednw.com/biofeedback-mind-body-medicine/) approach to understanding primary care, Dr. Andrew Simon encourages an awareness of how our behavioral actions in our day affect our interaction with our environment. Discerning how our symptoms or how we are feeling could be a reflection of the mental health environment we place ourselves in, and how this aggravates or affects true disease pathology from genetics, life experiences, trauma, injury, and consequences of living. Using proper biomechanics, ergonomics, and anatomy to teach ourselves new ways of navigating away from pain, Dr. Andrew Simon has core training in [musculoskeletal medicine](https://rebelmednw.com/pain-and-physical-medicine/) similar to an osteopathic physician as a hybrid of what a [chiropractor](https://rebelmednw.com/2016/11/chiropractic/), physical therapist, and primary physician would embody in their care all in one.
