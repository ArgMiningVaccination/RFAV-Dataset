Your NHS number helps healthcare staff to identify you correctly, find your patient records and ensures the safety of your healthcare. Your NHS number is printed on the medical card given to you when you register with a GP practice. Each NHS number is made up of ten digits, as shown in this example: 123 456 7890. How we protect your information Providing care across North West London Staff involved in your care work with other healthcare professionals in north west London and need to be able to see relevant information about you, so we share some information as required. This information can include your NHS number, age, contact details, next of kin, medication and allergies, appointments, treatment and care, and test results such as blood tests, laboratory tests, and X-rays. This will ensure when you visit your GP practice, the hospital, or get support in your community or at home, your care professional will have the right information about you at the right time. For example, we share our Cerner electronic patient record system with The Hillingdon Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which includes Hillingdon Hospital and Mount Vernon Hospital. Let's say you are treated at one of our hospitals and at Mount Vernon Hospital. Your clinical teams will see information that has been collected about you at both hospitals. Only staff involved in your direct care will look at your record. And they will have a more complete picture of your health when they make decisions about your care. We share your information with health and social care organisations who are involved in looking after you, unless you ask us not to. This is known as 'implied consent'. If you would like to opt out of sharing your information with other health and social care organisations, or if you have any questions or concerns, please speak to your clinician or contact our [Patient "}
