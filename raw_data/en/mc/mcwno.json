INTRODUCTIONAtherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading causeof death in North Americans, but manifest disease in childhood and ado-lescence is rare. By contrast, risk factors and risk behaviors that acceler-ate the development of atherosclerosis begin in childhood, and there isincreasing evidence that risk reduction delays progression toward clinicaldisease. In response, the former director of the National Heart, Lung, andBlood Institute (NHLBI), Dr Elizabeth Nabel, initiated development of cardio-vascular health guidelines for pediatric care providers based on a formalevidence review of the science with an integrated format addressing allthe major cardiovascular risk factors simultaneously. An expert panel wasappointed to develop the guidelines in the fall of 2006.The goal of the expert panel was to develop comprehensive evidence-basedguidelines that address the known risk factors for CVD (Table 1-1) toassistall primary pediatric care providers in both the promotion of cardio-vascular health and the identication and management of specic riskfactors from infancy into young adult life. An innovative approach wasneeded, because a focus on cardiovascular risk reduction in childrenand adolescents addresses a disease process (atherosclerosis) inwhich the clinical end point of manifest CVD is remote. The recommen-dations, therefore, need to address 2 different goals: the prevention ofrisk-factor development (primordial prevention) and the prevention offuture CVD by effective management of identied risk factors (primaryprevention).The evidence review also required an innovative approach. Most sys-tematic evidence reviews include 1 or, at most, a small number of nitequestions that address the impact of specic interventions on specichealth outcomes, and a rigorous literature review often results in onlya handful of in-scope articles for inclusion. Typically, evidence is limitedto randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews, and meta-analyses published over a dened time period. There is a dened for-mat for abstracting studies, grading the evidence, and presenting ofresults. The results of the review lead to the conclusions, independentof interpretation.By contrast, given the scope of the charge to the expert panel, thisevidence review needed to address a broad array of questions con-cerning the development, progression, and management of multiplerisk factors extending from birth through 21 years of age, includingstudies with follow-up into later adult life. The time frame extendedback to 1985,/H110115 years before the review for the last NHLBI guidelineaddressing lipids in children published in 1992.1This evidence islargely available in the form of epidemiologic observational studiesEXPERT PANEL ON INTEGRATED GUIDELINES FORCARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH AND RISK REDUCTION INCHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTSABBREVIATIONSCVD\u2014cardiovascular diseaseNHLBI\u2014National Heart, of PediatricsDGA\u2014Dietary Guidelines for AmericansNCEP\u2014National Cholesterol Education ProgramDASH\u2014Dietary Approaches to Stop HypertensionCHILD\u2014Cardiovascular Health Integrated Lifestyle DieFLP\u2014fasting lipid proleCDC\u2014Centers for Disease Control and PreventionAMA\u2014American Medical AssociationMCHB\u2014Maternal and Child Health BureauFDA\u2014Food and Drug AdministrationAHA\u2014American Heart Associationwww.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2009-2107Cdoi:10.1542/peds.2009-2107CAccepted for publication Sep 8, 2011Address correspondence to Janet M. de Jesus, MS, RD, 31Center Dr, Building 31, the American Academy of PediatricsFINANCIAL DISCLOSURE:Dr Daniels has served as a consultantfor Abbott Laboratories, Merck, and Schering-Plough and hasreceived funding/grant support for research from the NationalInstitutes of Health (NIH); Dr Gidding has served as a consultantfor Merck and Schering-Plough and has received funding/grantsupport for research from GlaxoSmithKline; Dr Gillman hasgiven invited talks for Nestle Nutrition Institute and Danone andhas received funding/grant support for research from MeadJohnson, Sano-Aventis, and the NIH; Dr Gottesman has servedon the Health Advisory Board, Child Development Council ofFranklin County, was a consultant to Early Head Start for Region5B, has written for iVillage and taught classes through Garrison(Continued on last page)SUPPLEMENT ARTICLES PEDIATRICS Volume 128, Supplement 5, December 2011S213 by Susan Walker on September 10, 2012pediatrics.aappublications.orgDownloaded from (rather than RCTs) that, therefore,must be included in the review. In ad-dition, the review required critical ap-praisal of the body of evidence that ad-dresses the impact of managing riskfactors in childhood on the develop-ment and progression of atherosclero-sis. Because of known gaps in the evi-dence base relating risk factors andrisk reduction in childhood to clinicalevents in adult life, the review must in-clude the available evidence that justi-es evaluation and treatment of riskfactors in childhood. The process ofidentifying, assembling, and organiz-ing the evidence was extensive, the re-view process was complex, and theconclusions could only be developedby interpretation of the body of evi-dence. Even with inclusion of every rel-evant study from the evidence review,there were important areas in whichthe evidence was inadequate.

Two major contempo-rary studies, the of ex-tent atherosclerosis ad-olescents, and young adults who diedaccidentally. The Bogalusa study3mea-sured cardiovascular risk factors(lipid levels, blood pressure [BP], BMI,and tobacco use) as part of a compre-hensive school-based epidemiologicstudy in a biracial community. Theseresults were related to atherosclero-sis measured at autopsy after acciden-tal death. Strong correlations wereshown between the presence and in-tensity of risk factors and the extentand severity of atherosclerosis. In thePDAY study,2risk factors and surro-gate measures of risk factors weremeasured after death in 15- to 34-yearolds who died accidentally of externalcauses. Strong relationships werefound between atherosclerotic sever-ity and extent, and age, non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) choles-terol, HDL cholesterol, hypertension(determined by tobacco use (thiocyanate con-centration), diabetes mellitus (DM)(glycohemoglobin), and (in men) obe-sity. There was a striking increase inboth severity and extent as age and thenumber of risk factors increased. Bycontrast, the absence of risk factorswas shown to be associated with a vir-tual absence of advanced atheroscle-rotic lesions, even in the oldest sub-jects in the study.Evidence Linking Risk Factors inChildhood to AtherosclerosisAssessed NoninvasivelyOver the last decade, measures of sub-clinical atherosclerosis have devel-oped, including the demonstration ultrasoundimaging, and increased left ventricularmass with cardiac ultrasound. Thesemeasures have been assessed inyoung people with severe abnormali-ties of individual risk factors:In adolescents with a marked eleva-tion of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)cholesterol caused by of calcium,increased CIMT, and impaired endo-thelial function have been found.Children with hypertension havebeen shown to have increased CIMT,increased left ventricular mass, andeccentric left ventricular geometry.Children with type 1 DM havesignicantly abnormal endothelialfunction and, in some studies, in-creased CIMT.Children and young adults with afamily history of increased dysfunction has beenshown by ultrasound and plethys-mography with ciga-rette smoking and active)TABLE 1-3Evidence Grading System: Strength of RecommendationsStatement TypeDenitionImplicationStrong recommendation The expert panel believes that the benets of the recommended approachclearly exceed the harms and that the quality of the supportingevidence is excellent (grade A or B).

In obese children, im-provement with at lev-els associated with excess mortalityin adults has been found in childrenwith severe obesity.Four longitudinal studies have found re-lationships of risk factors measured inyouth (specically LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol and serum apolipopro-teins, obesity, hypertension, tobaccouse, and DM) with measures of subclini-cal atherosclerosis in adulthood. Inmany of these studies, risk factors mea-sured in childhood and adolescencewere better predictors of the severity ofadult atherosclerosis than were risk fac-tors measured at the time of the subclin-ical atherosclerosis study.Evidence Linking Risk Factors inChildhood to Clinical CVDThe most important evidence relatingrisk in youth to clinical CVD is the ob-served association of risk factors foratherosclerosis to clinically manifestcardiovascular conditions. Genetic dis-orders related to high cholesterol arethe biological for risk-factor im-pact on the atherosclerotic hypercholesterol-emia, cholesterol levelsexceed 800 mg/dL beginning in infancy,coronary events begin in the rst de-cade of life and life span is severelyshortened. With heterozygous hyper-cholesterolemia, in which LDL mg/dL and infancy, 50% ofmen and 25% of women experienceclinical coronary events by the age of50. By contrast, genetic traits associ-ated with low cholesterol are associ-ated with longer life expectancy. In thePDAY study,2every 30 mg/dL increasein non-HDL cholesterol level was asso-ciated with a visible incremental in-crease in the extent and severity ofatherosclerosis. In natural-historystudies of DM, early CVD mortality is soconsistently observed that the pres-ence of DM is considered evidence ofvascular disease in adults. Consonantwith this evidence, in 15- to 19-yearolds in the PDAY study, the presence ofhyperglycemia was associated withthe demonstration of advanced ath-erosclerotic lesions of the coronaryarteries. In the PDAY study, there wasalso a strong relationship between ab-dominal aortic atherosclerosis and to-bacco use. Finally, in a 25-year the presence of the metabolicsyndrome risk-factor cluster in child-hood predicted clinical CVD in adultsubjects at 30 to 48 years of age.4The Impact of Racial/EthnicBackground and SocioeconomicStatus in Childhood on theDevelopment of AtherosclerosisCVD has been observed in diverse geo-graphic areas and all racial and ethnicbackgrounds. Cross-sectional re-search in children has found differ-ences according to race and ethnicityand according to geography for preva-lence of cardiovascular risk factors;these differences are often partiallyexplained by differences in socioeco-nomic status. No group within theUnited States is without a signicantprevalence of risk. Several longitudi-nal cohort studies referenced report (Bogalusa study5) have includedracially diverse populations, and otherstudies have been conducted outsidethe United States. However, longitudi-nal data on Hispanic, Native American,and Asian children are lacking. Clini-cally important differences in preva-lence of risk factors exist according torace and gender, particularly with re-gard to tobacco-use rates, obesityprevalence, hypertension, and dyslipi-demia. Low socioeconomic status inand of itself confers substantial risk.However, evidence is not adequate forthe recommendations provided in thisreport to be specic to racial or ethnicgroups or socioeconomic status.The Impact of Risk-FactorClustering in Childhood on theDevelopment of AtherosclerosisFrom a population standpoint, cluster-ing of multiple risk factors is the mostcommon association with prematureatherosclerosis. The pathologic stud-ies reviewed above clearly showedthat the presence of multiple risk fac-tors is associated with striking evi-dence of an accelerated atheroscle-rotic process. Among the mostprevalent multiple-risk combinationsare the use of tobacco with 1 other riskfactor and the development of obesity,which is often associated with insulinresistance, elevated triglyceride lev-els, reduced HDL cholesterol levels,and elevated BP, a combination knownin adults as the metabolic syndrome.There is ample evidence from bothcross-sectional and longitudinal stud-ies that the increasing prevalence ofobesity in childhood is associated withthe same obesity-related risk-factorclustering seen in adults and that itcontinues into adult life. This high-riskcombination is among the reasonsthat the current obesity epidemic withits relationship to future CVD and DM isconsidered one of the most importantpublic health challenges in contempo-rary society. One other prevalentmultiple-risk combination is the asso-ciation of low cardiorespiratory t-ness (identied in 33.6% of adoles-cents in the National andNutrition Examination Surveys [NHANES]from 1999 to 20026) with overweightand obesity, elevated TC level and sys-tolic BP, and a reduced HDL cholesterollevel.S216EXPERT PANEL by Susan Walker on September 10, 2012pediatrics.aappublications.orgDownloaded from Risk-Factor Tracking FromChildhood Into Adult LifeTracking studies from childhood toadulthood have been performed for allthe major risk factors.Obesity tracks more strongly thanany other risk factor; among manyreports from studies that have dem-onstrated this fact, one of the mostrecent is from the Bogalusa study,7in which/H110222000 children were fol-lowed from initial evaluation at 5 to14 years of age to adult follow-up ata mean age of 27 years. On the basisof BMI percentiles derived from thestudy population, 84% in the 95th to 99th percentileas children were obese as adults,and all a BMI at the/H1102299th percentile were obese inadulthood. Increased increasing whichthe elevated BMI occurs.For cholesterol and BP, trackingcorrelation coefcients in the rangeof 0.4 have been reported consis-tently from many studies, correlat-ing these measures in children 5 to10 years of age with results 20 to 30years later. These data suggest thathaving cholesterol or BP levels inthe upper portion of the pediatricdistribution makes having them asadult risk factors likely but not cer-tain. Those who develop obesityhave been shown to be more likelyto develop hypertension or dyslipi-demia as adults.Tracking data on physical tnessare more limited. Physical activitylevels do track but not as stronglyas other risk factors.By its addictive nature, tobacco usepersists into adulthood, although/H1101150% of those who have eversmoked eventually quit.T1DM is a lifelong condition.The insulin resistance of T2DM can bealleviated by exercise, weight loss, andbariatric surgery, but the long-term out-come of those with T2DM diagnosed inchildhood is not known.As already discussed, risk-factorclusters such as those seen withobesity and the metabolic syndromehave been shown to track fromchildhood into adulthood.CVD Prevention Beginning in YouthThe rationale for these guidelinescomes from the following evidence.Atherosclerosis, the pathologic ba-sis for clinical CVD, originates inchildhood.Risk factors for the development ofatherosclerosis can be identied inchildhood.Development and progression ofatherosclerosis clearly relates tothe number and intensity of cardio-vascular risk factors, which begin inchildhood.Risk factors track from childhoodinto adult life.Interventions exist for the manage-ment of identied risk factors.The evidence for the rst 4 bulletpoints is reviewed in this section, andthe evidence surrounding interven-tions for identied risk factors is ad-dressed in the risk-factor-specicsections of the guideline to follow.It is important to distinguish betweenthe goals of prevention at a young ageand those at older ages in which ath-erosclerosis is well established, mor-bidity may already exist, and the pro-cess is only minimally reversible. At ayoung age, there have historically been2 goals of prevention: (1) prevent thedevelopment of risk factors (primor-dial prevention); and (2) recognize andmanage those children and adoles-cents who are at increased risk as aresult of the presence of identied riskfactors (primary prevention). It is wellestablished that a population that en-ters adulthood with lower risk willhave less atherosclerosis and will col-lectively have lower CVD rates. Thisconcept is supported by research thathas found that (1)societies with lowlevels of cardiovascular risk factorshave low CVD rates and that changesin risk in those societies are associ-ated with a change in CVD rates, (2)in adults, control of risk factorsleads to a decline in morbidity andmortality from CVD, and (3) thosewithout childhood risk have minimalatherosclerosis at 30 to 34 years ofage, absence of subclinical athero-sclerosis as young adults, extendedlife expectancy, and a better qualityof life free from CVD.The Pathway to RecommendingClinical Practice-Based PreventionThe most direct means of establishingevidence for active CVD prevention be-ginning at a young age would be to ran-domly assign young people withdened risks to treatment of cardio-vascular risk factors or to no treat-ment and follow both groups oversufcient time to determine if cardio-vascular events are prevented withoutundue increase in morbidity arisingfrom treatment. This direct approachis intellectually attractive, becauseatherosclerosis prevention would be-gin at the earliest stage of the diseaseprocess and thereby maximize thebenet. However, this approach is asunachievable as it is attractive, pri-marily because such studies would beextremely expensive and would be sev-eral decades in duration, a time periodin which changes in environment andmedical practice would diminish therelevance of the results.The recognition that evidence fromthis direct pathway is unlikely to beachieved requires an alternative step-wise approach in which segments ofan evidence chain are linked in a man-ner that serves as a sufciently rigor-ous proxy for the causal inference of aSUPPLEMENT ARTICLES PEDIATRICS Volume 128, Supplement 5, December 2011S217 by Susan Walker on September 10, 2012pediatrics.aappublications.orgDownloaded from clinical trial. The evidence reviewed inthis section provides the critical ratio-nale for cardiovascular prevention be-ginning in childhood: atherosclerosisbegins in youth; the atheroscleroticprocess relates factors that canbe identied in childhood; and thepresence of these risk factors in agiven child predicts an adult with riskif no intervention occurs. The remain-ing evidence links pertain to the dem-onstration that interventions to lowerrisk will have a health benet and thatthe risk and cost of interventions toimprove risk are outweighed by the re-duction in CVD morbidity and mortal-ity. These issues are captured in theevidence reviews of each risk factor.The recommendations reflect a com-plex decision process that integratesthe strength of the evidence withknowledge of the natural history ofatherosclerotic vascular disease, esti-mates of intervention risk, and the phy-sician's responsibility to provide bothhealth education and effective diseasetreatment. These recommendationsfor those caring for children will bemost effective when complemented bya broader public health strategy.The Childhood Medical Ofce Visitas the Setting for CardiovascularHealth ManagementOne cornerstone of pediatric care isplacing clinical recommendations in adevelopmental context. Those whomake pediatric recommendationsmust consider not only the relation ofage to disease expression but the abil-ity of the patient and family to under-stand and implement medical advice.For each risk factor, recommenda-tions must be specic to age and devel-opmental stage. TheBright Futuresconcept of the American Academy ofPediatrics8(AAP) is used to provide aframework for these guidelines withcardiovascular risk-reduction recom-mendations for each age group.This document provides recommenda-tions for preventing the developmentof risk factors and optimizing cardio-vascular health, beginning in infancy,that are based on the results of theevidence review. Pediatric care provid-ers (pediatricians, family practitio-ners, nurses, nurse practitioners,physician assistants, registered dieti-tians) are ideally positioned to rein-force cardiovascular health behaviorsas part of routine care. The guidelinealso offers specic guidance on pri-mary prevention with age-specic,evidence-based recommendations forindividual risk-factor detection. Man-agement algorithms provide stagedcare recommendations for risk reduc-tion within the pediatric care settingand identify risk-factor levels that re-quire specialist referral. The guide-lines also identify specic medical con-ditions such as DM and chronic kidneydisease that are associated with in-creased risk for accelerated athero-sclerosis. Recommendations forongoing cardiovascular health man-agement for children and adolescentswith these diagnoses are provided.A cornerstone of pediatric care is theprovision of health education. In the UShealth care system, physicians andnurses are perceived as credible mes-sengers for health information. Thechildhood health maintenance visitprovides an ideal context for effectivedelivery of the cardiovascular healthmessage. Pediatric care providersprovide an effective team educated toinitiate behavior change to diminishrisk of CVD and promote lifelong car-diovascular health in their patientsfrom infancy into young adult life.3. CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTHSCHEDULE (p. S219)4. FAMILY HISTORY OF EARLYATHEROSCLEROTIC CVDA family history of CVD represents thenet effect of shared genetic, biochemi-cal, behavioral, and environmentalcomponents. In adults, epidemiologicstudies have found that a family his-tory of premature coronary heart dis-ease in a rst-degree relative (heartattack, treated angina, percutaneouscoronary catheter interventional pro-cedure, coronary artery bypass sur-gery, stroke, or sudden cardiac deathin a male parent or sibling before theage of 55 years or a female parent orsibling before the age of 65 years) is animportant independent risk factor forfuture CVD. The process of atheroscle-rosis is complex and involves many ge-netic loci and multiple environmentaland personal risk factors. Nonethe-less, the presence of a positive paren-tal history has been consistently foundto signicantly increase baseline riskfor CVD. The risk for CVD in offspring isstrongly inversely related to the age ofthe parent at the time of the indexevent. The association of a positivefamily history with increased cardio-vascular risk has been conrmed formen, women, and siblings and in dif-ferent racial and ethnic groups. The ev-idence review identied all RCTs, sys-tematic reviews, meta-analyses, andobservational studies addressedfamily history of premature athero-sclerotic disease and the developmentand progression of atherosclerosisfrom childhood into young adult life.Conclusions and Grading of theEvidence Review for the Role ofFamily History in CardiovascularHealthEvidence from observational stud-ies strongly supports inclusion of apositive family history of early coro-nary heart disease in identifyingchildren at risk for accelerated ath-erosclerosis and for the presence ofan abnormal risk prole (grade B).For adults, a positive family historyis dened as a parent and/or siblingwith a history of treated angina,S218EXPERT PANEL by Susan Walker on September 10, 2012pediatrics.aappublications.orgDownloaded from 3.

Becausethe parents and siblings of childrenand adolescents are usually youngthemselves, it was the panel con-sensus that when evaluating familyhistory of a child, history shouldalso be ascertained for the occur-rence of CVD in grandparents,aunts, and uncles, although the evi-dence supporting this recommen-dation is insufcient to date (gradeD).Identication of a positive familyhistory for cardiovascular diseaseand/or cardiovascular risk fac-tors should lead to evaluation ofall family members, especiallyparents, for cardiovascular riskfactors (grade B).Family history evolves as a child ma-tures, so regular updates are a nec-essary part of routine pediatriccare (grade D).Education about the importance ofaccurate and complete familyhealth information should be part ofroutine care for children and ado-lescents. As genetic sophisticationincreases, linking family history tospecic genetic abnormalities willprovide important new knowledgeabout the atherosclerotic process(grade D).Recommendations for the use of fam-ily history in cardiovascular healthpromotion are listed in Table 4-1.5. NUTRITION AND DIETThe 2010Dietary Guidelines for Ameri-cans(DGA)8include important recom-mendations for the population aged 2years and older. In 1992, the NationalCholesterol Education Program (NCEP)Pediatric Panel report1provided di-etary recommendations for all chil-dren as part of a population-based ap-proach to reducing cardiovascularrisk. Evidence relative to diet and thedevelopment of atherosclerosis inchildhood and adolescence was identi-ed by the evidence review for thisguideline and, collectively, providesthe rationale for new dietary preven-tion efforts initiated early in life.This new pediatric cardiovascularguideline not only builds on the recom-mendations for achieving nutrient ad-equacy in growing children as statedin the 2010 DGA but also adds evidenceregarding the efcacy of specic di-etary changes in reducing cardiovas-cular risk from the current evidencereview for use by pediatric care pro-viders in the care of their patients. Be-cause the focus of these guidelines ison cardiovascular risk reduction, theevidence review specically evaluateddietary fatty acid and energy compo-nents as major contributors to hyper-cholesterolemia and obesity, as wellas dietary composition and micronu-trients as they affect hypertension.New evidence from multiple dietary tri-als that addressed cardiovascular riskreduction in children has providedimportant information for theserecommendations.Conclusions and Grading of theEvidence Review for Diet andNutrition in Cardiovascular RiskReductionThe expert panel concluded that thereis strong and consistent evidence thatgood nutrition beginning at birth hasprofound health benets and the po-tential to decrease future risk for CVD.The expert panel accepts the 2010 DGA8as containing appropriate recommen-dations for diet and nutrition in chil-dren aged 2 years and older. The rec-ommendations in these guidelines areintended for pediatric care providersto use with their patients to addresscardiovascular risk reduction. Theconclusions of the expert panel's re-view of the entire body of evidence in aspecic nutrition area with grades aresummarized. Where the evidence is in-adequate yet nutrition guidance isneeded, recommendations for pediat-ric care providers are based on a con-sensus of the expert panel (grade D).The age- and evidence-based recom-mendations of the expert panel follow.In accordance with the Surgeon Gen-eral's Ofce, the World Health Organi-zation, the AAP, and the AmericanAcademy of Family Physicians, exclu-sive breastfeeding is recommendedfor the rst 6 months of life. Contin-ued breastfeeding is recommendedto at least 12 months of age with theaddition of complementary foods. Ifbreastfeeding per se is not possible,feeding human milk by bottle is sec-ond best, and formula-feeding is thethird choice.Long-term follow-up studies subjects breast-fed cardiovascularhealth benets, including lower cho-lesterol levels, lower BMI, reducedprevalence of type 2 DM, and lowerCIMT in adulthood (grade B).Ongoing nutrition counseling hasbeen effective in assisting childrenand families to adopt and sustainrecommended diets for both nutri-ent adequacy and reducing cardio-vascular risk (grade A).Within appropriate age- and gender-based requirements for growth andnutrition, in normal children and inchildren with hypercholesterolemiaintake of total fat can be safely lim-ited to 30% of total calories, satu-rated fat intake limited to 7% to 10%of calories, and dietary cholesterollimited to 300 mg/day. Under theguidance of qualied nutritionists,this dietary composition has beenshown to result in lower TC and LDLS220EXPERT PANEL by Susan Walker on September 10, 2012pediatrics.aappublications.orgDownloaded from cholesterol levels, less obesity, andless insulin resistance (grade A).Under similar conditions and withongoing follow-up, these levels of fatintake might have similar effectsstarting in infancy (grade B). Fatsare important to infant diets be-cause of their role in brain and cog-nitive development. Fat intake for in-fants younger than 12 monthsshould not be restricted withoutmedical indication.The remaining 20% of fat intakeshould comprise a combination ofmonosaturated and polyunsatu-rated fats (grade D). Intake of transfats should be limited as much aspossible (grade D).For adults, the current NCEP guide-lines9recommend that adults 25% to 35% of calories 2010 the Insti-tute of Medicine recommendationsfor 30% to 40% of calories from fatfor ages 1 to 3 years, 25% to 35% ofcalories from fat for ages 4 to 18years, and 20% to 35% of caloriesfrom fat for adults. For growing chil-dren, milk provides essential nutri-ents, including protein, calcium,magnesium, and vitamin D, that arenot readily available elsewhere inthe diet. Consumption of fat-freemilk in childhood after 2 years ofage and through adolescence opti-mizes these benets without com-promising nutrient quality whileavoiding excess saturated fat andcalorie intake (grade A). Betweenthe ages of 1 and 2 years, as chil-dren transition from breast milk orformula, reduced-fat milk (rangingfrom 2% milk to fat-free milk) can beused on the basis of the child'sgrowth, appetite, intake of othernutrient-dense foods, intake ofother sources of fat, and risk forobesity and CVD. Milk with reducedfat should be used only in the con-text of an overall diet that supplies30% of calories from fat. Dietary in-tervention should be tailored toeach specic child's needs.Optimal protein andtotal carbohydrate in children werenot specically addressed, but witha recommended total fat intake of30% of energy, the expert panel rec-ommends that the remaining 70% ofcalories include 15% to 20% fromprotein and 50% to from carbo-hydrate (no Theserecommended ranges 65% of cal-ories from carbohydrate for chil-dren aged 4 to 18 years.Sodium intake was not addressed bythe evidence review for this section onnutrition and diet. From the evidencereview for the \"High BP\" section,lower sodium intake is systolic and BP ininfants, children, and adolescents.Plant-based foods are important low-calorie sources of nutrients includingvitamins and ber in the diets of chil-dren; increasing access to fruits andvegetables has been shown to in-crease their intake (grade A). How-ever, increasing fruit and vegetableintake is an ongoing challenge.Reduced intake of sugar-sweetenedbeverages is associated with de-creased obesity measures (grade B).Specic information about fruit juiceintake is too limited for an evidence-based recommendation. Recommen-dations for intake of 100% fruit juiceby infants was made by a consensusof the expert panel (grade D) and arein agreement with those of the AAP.Per the 2010 DGA, energy intakeshould not exceed energy neededfor adequate growth and physicalactivity. Calorie intake needs tomatch growth demands and physi-cal activity needs (grade A). Esti-mated calorie requirements ac-cording to gender and age group at3 levels of physical activity from thedietary guidelines are shown in Ta-ble 5-2. For children of normalweight whose activity is minimal,most calories are needed to meet nu-tritional requirements, which leavesonly/H110115% to 15% of calorie intakefrom extra calories. These caloriescan be derived from fat or sugaradded to nutrient-dense foods to al-low their consumption as sweets, des-serts, or snack foods (grade D).Dietary ber intake is inversely as-sociated with energy density and in-creased levels of body fat and is pos-itively associated with nutrientdensity (grade B); a daily total di-etary ber intake from food sourcesof at least age plus 5 g for youngchildren up to 14 g/1000 kcal forolder children and adolescents isrecommended (grade D).The expert panel supports the 2008AAP recommendation for vitamin Dsupplementation with 400 IU/day forall infants and children.10No othervitamin, mineral, or dietary supple-ments are recommended (grade D).The new recommended daily allow-ance for vitamin D for those aged 1to 70 years is 600 IU/day.Use of dietary patterns modeled onthose shown to be benecial foradults (eg, Dietary Approaches toStop Hypertension [DASH] pattern)is a promising approach to improv-ing nutrition and decreasing cardio-vascular risk (grade B).All diet recommendations must beinterpreted for each child and fam-ily to address individual diet pat-terns and patient sensitivities suchas lactose intolerance and food al-lergies (grade D).Graded, age-specic recommenda-tions for pediatric care providers toSUPPLEMENT ARTICLES PEDIATRICS Volume 128, Supplement 5, December 2011S221 by Susan Walker on September 10, 2012pediatrics.aappublications.orgDownloaded from use in optimizing cardiovascularhealth in their patients are summa-rized in Table 5-1. The CardiovascularHealth Integrated Lifestyle Diet(CHILD-1) is the rst stage in dietarychange for children with identied dys-lipidemia, overweight and obesity,risk-factor clustering, and high-riskmedical conditions that might ulti-mately require more intensive dietarychange. CHILD-1 is also the recom-mended diet for children with a posi-tive family history of early cardiovas-cular disease, dyslipidemia, obesity,primary hypertension, DM, or expo-sure to smoking in the home. Any di-etary modication must provide nutri-ents and calories needed for optimalgrowth and development (Table 5-2).Recommended intakes are adequatelymet by a DASH-style eating plan, whichemphasizes fat-free/low-fat dairy andincreased intake of fruits and vegeta-bles. This diet has been modied foruse in children aged 4 years and olderon the basis of daily energy needs ac-cording to food group and is shown inTable 5-3 as an example of a heart-healthy eating plan using CHILD-1recommendations.6. PHYSICAL ACTIVITYPhysical activity is any bodily move-ment produced by contraction of skel-etal muscle that increases energy ex-penditure above a basal level. Physicalactivity can be focused on strengthen-ing muscles, bones, and joints, but be-cause these guidelines address car-diovascular health, the evidencereview concentrated on aerobic activ-ity and on the opposite of activity: sed-entary behavior. There is strong evi-dence for benecial effects of physicalactivity and disadvantageous effects ofa sedentary lifestyle on the overallhealth of children and adolescentsacross a broad array of domains. Ourreview focused on the effects of activ-ity on cardiovascular health, becausephysical inactivity has been identiedas an independent risk factor for cor-onary heart disease in adults. Over thelast several decades, there has been asteady decrease in the amount of timethat children spend being physicallyactive and an accompanying increasein timespent in sedentary activities. Theevidence review identied many studiesin youth ranging in age from 4 to 21 yearsthat strongly linked increased timespent in sedentary activities with re-duced overall activity levels, disadvanta-geous lipid proles, higher systolic BP,higher levels of obesity, and higher levelsof all the obesity-related cardiovascularrisk factors including hypertension, in-sulin resistance, and type 2 DM.Conclusions and Grading of theEvidence Review for PhysicalActivityThe expert panel felt that the evidencestrongly supports the role of physicalactivity in optimizing cardiovascularhealth in children and adolescents.There is reasonably good evidencethat physical activity patterns estab-lished in childhood are carried for-ward into adulthood (grade C).There is strong evidence that in-creases in moderate-to-vigorousphysical activity are associated withlower systolic and diastolic improved mea-sures, lower TC level, lower LDLcholesterol level, lower triglyceridelevel, higher HDL cholesterol level,and decreased insulin resistance inchildhood and adolescence (gradeA).There is limited but strong and con-sistent evidence that physical exer-cise interventions improve subclini-cal measures of atherosclerosis(grade B).Physical activity patterns, dietarychoices, and smoking behaviorscluster together (grade C).TABLE 4-1Evidence-Based Recommendations for Use of Family History in CardiovascularHealth PromotionBirth to 18 y Take detailed family history of CVD at initial encounter and/or at 3,9-11, and 18 yaGrade BRecommendIf positive family history identied, evaluate patient for othercardiovascular risk factors, including dyslipidemia, hypertension,DM, obesity, history of smoking, and sedentary lifestyleIf positive family history and/or cardiovascular risk factors identied,evaluate family, especially parents, for cardiovascular risk factorsGrade BRecommendUpdate family history at each nonurgent health encounter Grade DRecommendUse family history to stratify risk for CVD risk as risk prole evolves Grade DRecommendSupportive action:educate parents about the importance of familyhistory in estimating future health risks for all family members18 to 21 y Review family history of heart disease with young adult patient Grade BStrongly recommendSupportive action:educate patient about family/personal risk forearly heart disease, including the need for evaluation for allcardiovascular risk factorsGradesreflect the ndings of the evidence review;recommendation levelsreflect the consensus opinion of the expertpanel; andsupportive actionsrepresent expert consensus suggestions from the expert panel provided to supportimplementation of the recommendations (they are not graded).a\"Family\" includes parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, or sibling with heart attack, treated angina, coronary artery bypassgraft/stent/angioplasty, stroke, or sudden cardiac death at/H1102155 y in males and/H1102165 y in females.

In workingwith children and families, the expertpanel suggested that moderate-to-vigorous activity could be comparedwith jogging or playing baseball and thatvigorous physical activity could be com-pared with running, playing singles ten-nis, or playing soccer.

TOBACCO EXPOSURETobacco dependence is responsible for/H110114m i l l i o nd e a t h sw o r l d w i d ea n n u a l l y ,and in utero exposure to tobacco prod-ucts, involuntary tobacco smoke expo-sure (secondhand smoke), and tobaccouse directly impair health in fetuses, in-fants, children, and adolescents. On thebasis of an analysis of published causesof death, tobacco use is the leading ac-tual cause of death in the United States.The evidence that cigarette use is harm-ful and addictive is unequivocal. Inchild-hood, nicotine is highly addicting;symptoms of tobacco dependencehave been found after brief intermit-tent use. Cigarette use among highschool students declined from 1997 to2003. Rates were stable from 2003 to2007 with/H1102220% of high school stu-dents reporting daily smoking. From apublic health standpoint, the need toreduce tobacco exposure is compel-ling, and a role for pediatric healthcare providers is essential.A clinical practice guideline updatefrom the US Public Health Service pub-lished in May 200812systematically re-viewed almost 9000 publications andconcluded that smoking preventionand cessation interventions are effec-tive in adults. These same methodsshould be safely applicable in child-hood and adolescence, because behav-ioral interventions to alter smoking be-haviors have little if any morbidity andbecause morbidity with pharmaco-logic treatment is limited. Physicianswho care for children are well posi-tioned to provide prevention and treat-ment interventions for their patients.Youth interventions must target par-ents as well as children, because pa-rental smoking is both a risk factor forchild smoking and provides second-hand smoke exposure to fetuses andchildren. The evidence review as-sessed prevention and treatment in-terventions in each of these areas.Conclusions and Grading of theEvidence on Preventing TobaccoExposureAmong all the known risk factors forCVD, the dichotomy between known ben-ets of risk elimination and the paucityof evidence for effective interventions toachieve risk reduction in pediatric careprovider settings is greatest for tobaccoexposure. The quality of the evidence re-garding the harm of smoking and thebenets of avoiding passive smoke expo-sure, smoking prevention, and smokingcessation is uniformly grade A. That evi-dence grades in the recommendationsare less than grade A reflects the lack ofexisting evidence on interventions thatimpact smoking behaviors in specic pe-diatric age groups as opposed to the col-lective evidence.Good-quality interventions in pediatriccare settings to decrease children's en-vironmental smoke exposure have hadmixed results (grade B).Intervention studies to preventsmoking initiation have had moder-ate success, although long-term re-sults are limited (grade B).Practice-based interventions to achievesmoking cessation in adolescents havehad moderate success with limitedlong-term follow-up (grade B).School-based smoking-preventionprograms have been moderatelysuccessful with (grade B).Although the evidence base for effec-tive ofce-based approaches to to-bacco interventions is moderate andmixed, the evidence that cigarette useis harmful and addictive is unequivo-cal. The need to reduce tobacco expo-sure is so compelling that a role forpediatric health care providers is es-sential. The lack of harm associatedwith such interventions and the impor-tance of communicating the messageof risk associated with tobacco pro-vides the rationale for \"strongly rec-ommend\" despite the lack of conclu-sive evidence that ofce-basedinterventions reliably reduce tobaccoinitiation or smoking cessation. Physi-cians and nurses who care for chil-dren are well positioned to provide in-tervention to patients who smoke. Theexpert panel feels that such providersshould routinely identify patients whosmoke by using the medical history(Table 7-1). Patients should be explic-itly informed about the addictive andadverse health effects of tobacco use.By using the 5 A's (ask, advise, assess,assist, and arrange), providers can as-sess readiness to quit and assist inproviding resources to supportsmoking-cessation efforts. Informa-tion about telephone quit lines (eg,1-800-QUIT-NOW), community cessationprograms, and pharmacotherapyshould also be made available.As described, practice-based interven-tions to decrease environmentalsmoke exposure have had mixed re-sults. Nonetheless, the expert panelbelieves that pediatric care providersshould identify parents and othercaregivers who smoke and explicitlyrecommend that children not be ex-posed to tobacco smoke in the home,in automobiles, or in any other spacewhere exposure can occur. For theS226EXPERT PANEL by Susan Walker on September 10, 2012pediatrics.aappublications.orgDownloaded from parent who smokes, information pro-vided should include statements abouthealth benets to the individual, child,and/or fetus and referral to smoking-cessation care providers.8. HIGH BPIn 2004, an NHLBI task force published\"The Fourth Report on the Diagnosis,Evaluation, and Treatment of HighBlood Pressure in Children and Adoles-cents.\"13This report included a com-plete review of the current evidence onthis subject and detailed recommen-dations for managing BP throughoutchildhood.These recommendationswere used as the basis for these guide-lines, considered complete until 2003when the review for the report ended.Therefore, this evidence review for BPfor these guidelines was limited to stud-ies published between January 1, 2003,and June 30, 2007, with the addition ofselected studies through June 30, 2008,identied by the expert panel as havingmet all the criteria for inclusion. Repeat-ing the review performed by the taskforce was not felt to be necessary, giventhe short time since publication of thatreport, or a judicious use of the re-sources available for development ofthese guidelines. Recommendations re-garding BP are all graded as expert opin-ion (grade D), because they are based onthe expert consensus conclusions of thisNHLBI task force.Conclusions of the Evidence-ReviewUpdate for High BP (2003-2008)The evidence review for the denedtime period resulted in no majorchanges in the approach to BP eval-uation and management.According to epidemiologic surveysof children and adolescents overthe past 20 years, BP levels havebeen increasing, and the prevalenceof hypertension and prehyperten-sion are also increasing, explainedpartially by the rise in obesity rates.TABLE 6-1Evidence-Based Activity Recommendations for Cardiovascular HealthNewborn to12 moParents should create an environment that promotes and modelsphysical activity and limits sedentary timeGrade DRecommendSupportive actions:Discourage TV viewing altogether1 to 4 y Allow unlimited active playtime in safe, supportive environments Grade DRecommendLimit sedentary time, especially TV/video Grade DRecommendSupportive actions:Limit total media time to no more than 1-2 hours of qualityprogramming per dayFor children/H113492 y old, discourage TV viewing altogetherNo TV in child's bedroomEncourage family activity at least once per weekCounsel routine activity for parents as role models for children5 to 10 y Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity every dayaGrade AStrongly activity 1 h/dawith vigorous-intensity physical activity 3 d/wkbLimit total media time to no more than 1-2 h/d of qualityprogrammingNo TV in child's bedroomTake activity and screen-time history from child once per yearMatch physical activity recommendations with energy intakeRecommend appropriate safety equipment relative to eachsportSupport recommendations for daily physical education inschools11 to 17 y Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity every dayaGrade leisure time TV/video/computer use Grade BStrongly to aim for h/d of moderate-to-vigorousdaily activityawith vigorous intense physical activityb3 d/wkEncourage no TV in bedroomLimit total media time to no more than 1-2 h/d of qualityprogrammingMatch activity recommendations with energy intakeTake activity and screen-time history from adolescent at healthsupervision visitsEncourage involvement in year-round physical activitiesSupport continued family activity once per week and/or familysupport of adolescent's physical activity programEndorse appropriate safety equipment relative to each sport18 to 21 y Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity every leisure 1 h/d of moderate-to-vigorous activity withvigorous intense physical activity 3 d/wkRecommend that combined leisure screen time not exceed 2 h/dActivity and screen-time history at health supervision visitsEncourage involvement in year-round, lifelong physical activitiesGradesreflect the ndings of the evidence review;recommendation levelsreflect the consensus opinion of the expertpanel; andsupportive actionsrepresent expert consensus suggestions from the expert panel provided to supportimplementation of the recommendations (they are not graded).aExamples of moderate-to-vigorous physical activities are jogging and playing baseball.bExamples of vigorous physical activities are running, playing singles tennis, and playing soccer.SUPPLEMENT ARTICLES PEDIATRICS Volume 128, Supplement 5, December 2011S227 by Susan Walker on September 10, 2012pediatrics.aappublications.orgDownloaded from Prehypertension progresses to hy-pertension at a rate of/H110117% peryear; hypertension persists in al-most one-third of boys and one-fourth of girls on 2-year longitudinalfollow-up.Breastfeeding and supplementationof formula with polyunsaturatedfatty acids in infancy are both asso-ciated with lower BP at follow-up.A DASH-style diet, which is rich infruits, vegetables, low-fat or fat-freedairy products, whole grains, sh,poultry, beans, seeds, and nuts andlower in sweets and added sugars,fats, and red meats than the typicalAmerican diet, is associated withlower BP.

Medications areshown in Table 8-5.In 1 study of small-for-gestational-age infants, a nutrient-enriched dietthat promoted rapid weight gain wasassociated with higher BP onfollow-up in late childhood.

A series of criticalobservational studies have found aclear correlation between lipoproteindisorders and the onset and severity ofatherosclerosis in children, adoles-cents, and young adults. A major in-crease in the prevalence of obesity hasled to a much larger population of chil-dren with dyslipidemia. At the time ofthe original guidelines, the focus wasalmost exclusively on identication ofchildren with an elevated LDL choles-terol level. Since then, the predomi-nant dyslipidemic pattern in childhoodis combined pattern associated elevationin triglyceride level, normal-to-mildelevation in LDL reduced HDL cholesterol level.Both dyslipidemic patterns havebeen shown to be associated with ini-tiation and progression of athero-sclerotic lesions in children and ad-olescents as demonstrated bypathology and imaging studies. Iden-tication of children with dyslipi-demias, which place them at in-creased risk for accelerated earlyatherosclerosis, must include a com-prehensive assessment of serumlipid and lipoprotein levels.The evidence review for lipids and lipo-proteins addressed the associationTABLE 8-1Age-Specic Recommendations for BP Measurement and Diagnosis ofHypertensionBirth to 3 y No routine BP measurementMeasure BP if history (/H11001) for neonatal complications, congenital heart disease, urinary/renal abnormality, solid-organ transplant, malignancy, drug prescription, orcondition known to raise BP or increase intracranial pressure (Table BP/H1135090th percentile by for etiology and treatment per algorithm (Figure8-2)3 to 11 y Annual BP measurement in all, interpreted for age/gender/height per Tables 8-3 and BP conrmed/H1102290th percentile,/H1102195th percentile/H11005prehypertension percentile/H110015 mm Hg:Repeat in 1-2 and BP conrmed/H1102295th mm HgRepeat BP by auscultation/H110033 at that visit, average all BP measurements andreevaluate BP categoryIf BP conrmed/H1102299th percentile/H110015 mm Hg/H11005stage pediatric HTN expert within 1 wk ORBegin BP treatment and initiate basic work-up, per Fig 8-212 to 17 y Annual BP measurement in all, interpreted for age/gender/height per Tables 8-3 and 8-4If BP/H1102190th percentile, counsel on 8-1)If BP conrmed/H1102290th percentile,/H1102195th percentile or/H11022120/80/H11005pre-HTN:CHILD-1 diet, activity recommendations, in 6 moIf BP/H1135095th percentile,/H1102199th percentile/H110015 mm HgRepeat in 1-2 and BP conrmed/H1135095th mm Hg:Repeat BP by auscultation/H110033 at that visit, average all BP measurements andreevaluate BP categoryIf BP conrmed/H1102299th percentile/H110015 mm Hg/H11005stage pediatric HTN expert within 1 wk ORBegin BP treatment and initiate work-up per Fig 8-218 to 21 y Measure BP at all health care visitsBP/H11350120/80 to 139/89/H11005pre-HTNBP/H11350140/90 to 159/99/H11005stage 1 HTNBP/H11350160/100/H11005stage 2 HTNBP recommendations are based on the NHLBI's \"The Fourth Report on the Diagnosis, Evaluation and Treatment of High BloodPressure in Children and Adolescents\" with the evidence review updated from 2003.

Pre-liminary evidence in children withheterozygous familial hypercholes-terolemia with markedly elevatedLDL cholesterol levels indicates thatearlier is associated withreduced subclinical evidence of ath-erosclerosis (grade B).Multiple prospective screening co-hort studies have demonstrated thenormal lipid and lipoprotein distri-butions in childhood, adolescence,and young adult life (Tables 9-1 and9-2) (grade B). Cohort studies havealso demonstrated signicanttracking of elevated lipid levels fromchildhood into adulthood. Lipid andlipoprotein results in childhood arepredictive of future adult lipopro-tein proles; the strongest statisti-cal correlation occurs between re-sults in late childhood and in thethird and fourth decades of life(grade B).TC and LDL cholesterol levels de-crease as much as 10% to 20% ormore during puberty (grade B). On thebasis of this normal pattern of changein lipid and lipoprotein levels withgrowth and maturation, 10 years ofage (range: 9 -11 years) is a stabletime for lipid assessment in children(grade D). For most children, this agerange will precede the onset ofpuberty.Signicant evidence exists to indicatethat using family history of prematureCVD or cholesterol disorders as theprimary factor in determining lipidscreening for children misses/H1101130%to 60% of children with dyslipidemias,and accurate and reliable measuresof family history are not available(grade B). In the absence of a clinicalor historic marker, identication ofchildren with lipid disorders that pre-dispose them to accelerated athero-sclerosis requires universal lipid as-sessment (grade B).Non-HDL cholesterol level has beenidentied as a signicant predictorof the presence of atherosclerosis,as powerful as any other lipoproteincholesterol measure in childrenand adolescents. For both childrenand adults, non-HDL cholesterollevel seems to more atherosclerosis and futureevents than TC, LDL cholesterol levels alone. A ma-jor advantage of non-HDL choles-terol is that it can be accurately cal-culated in a nonfasting state and istherefore practical to obtain in clin-ical practice. The expert panel feltthat non-HDL cholesterol should beadded as a screening tool for iden-tication of a dyslipidemic state inchildhood (grade B).In terms of other lipid measure-ments, (1) most but not all studieshave found that measurement ofapolipoprotein B and apolipopro-tein A-1 for universal screening pro-vides no additional advantage overmeasuring non-HDL cholesterol, LDLcholesterol, and HDL cholesterol lev-els, (2) measurement of lipopro-tein(a) is useful in the assessmentof children with both hemorrhagicand ischemic stroke, (3) in offspringof a parent with premature CVD andno other identiable risk factors, el-evations of apolipoprotein B, apoli-poprotein A-1, and been noted, and (4) measure-ment of lipoprotein subclasses andtheir sizes by advanced lipoproteintesting has not been found to havesufcient clinical utility in childrenat this time (grade B).Obesity is commonly associatedwith a combined dyslipidemia pat-tern with mild elevation in TC andLDL cholesterol levels, moderate-to-severe elevation in triglyceridelevel, and a low HDL cholesterollevel. This is the most common dys-lipidemic pattern seen in childhood,and lipid assessment in overweightand obese children identies an im-portant proportion of those withTABLE 8-2Conditions Under Which Children<3 Years Old Should Have BP MeasuredHistory of prematurity, very low birth weight, or other neonatal complication requiring intensive careCongenital heart disease (repaired or unrepaired)Recurrent urinary tract infections, hematuria, or proteinuriaKnown renal malformationsFamily history of congenital renal diseaseSolid-organ transplantMalignancy or bone marrow transplantTreatment with drugs known to raise BPOther systemic illnesses associated with hypertension (neurobromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, etc)Evidence of increased intracranial pressureReproduced with permission from High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on High Blood Pressure inChildren and Adolescents.Pediatrics. 2004;114(2 suppl 4th report):556.

Studies of bile acid se-questrants in children and adoles-cents aged 6 to 18 years with LDLcholesterol levels from 131 to 190mg/dL have resulted in TC reductionof 7% to of LDLcholesterol of to 20%, some-times with a modest elevation in tri-glyceride level. Bile acid seques-trants commonly cause adversegastrointestinal effects that can sig-nicantly affect compliance. How-ever, they are safe and moderatelyeffective (grade A).Statin medications inhibit hydroxy-methylglutarylcoenzyme A reduc-tase, which the endogenous cholesterol-synthesis pathway. This inhibition re-sults in a decrease in the intracellularpool of cholesterol, which signals up-regulation of LDL receptors and in-creased clearance of circulating LDLcholesterol. As a group, statins havebeen shown to reduce LDL cholesterolin children and adolescents withmarked LDL cholesterol elevation orfamilial hypercholesterolemia (de-ned as elevated LDL cholesterol inthe child in conjunction with a familyhistory of elevated LDL cholesteroland/or atherosclerosis or CAD) whenused from 8 weeks to 2 years for chil-dren aged 8 to 18 years.

Trial sub-jects were monitored carefullythroughout treatment; adverse ef-fects on growth, development, or sex-ual maturation were not seen, andadverse-event proles and efcacywere similar to those in studies ofadults (grade A).Adverse effects from statins arerare at standard of hepatic enzymeelevation and muscle toxicity did notdiffer between the statin and placebogroups. Routine monitoring of hepaticenzymes and clinical assessment formuscle toxicity are strongly recom-mended for children and adolescentson statin therapy (Table 9-12). The riskof adverse events increases with useof higher doses and interactingdrugs; the latter occurs primarilywith drugs that are metabolized bythe cytochrome P-450 system, whichis the primary mode of metabolismfor binding sequestrants maybe used in combination with a statinfor patients who fail to meet LDL cho-lesterol target levels with either med-ication alone. One pediatric study as-sessed this combination and found noincrease in adverse effects. The ef-cacy of the 2 agents together seems tobe additive (grade B).There is limited published experiencein children of use of niacin and -brates, which have been useful intreating adult patients with combineddyslipidemias. Efcacy and safetydata are limited, and no data are avail-able regarding newer formulations. Inadults, cholesterol absorption inhibi-tors have been advocated as an ad-junct to statin therapy for patientswho do not reach LDL cholesteroltherapeutic targets. Because their ac-tion is independent of and comple-mentary to that of statins, the LDL cho-lesterol-lowering effect is additive.No pediatric studies of monotherapywith cholesterol absorption inhibitorshad been published during the timeperiod for this evidence review. Theuse of niacin, brates, and cholesterolabsorption inhibitors should be insti-tuted only in consultation with a lipidspecialist (grade C).Medication therapy is rarely neededfor children with elevated triglycer-ide levels that respond well toweight loss and lifestyle changes(grade B) (Fig 9-2; Table 9-8).

OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITYThe dramatic increases in childhoodoverweight and obesity in the UnitedStates since 1980 are an importantpublic health focus. Despite effortsover the last decade to prevent andcontrol obesity, recent reports fromthe National Health and Nutrition Ex-amination sustainedhigh children andadolescents at the/H1102295thpercentile for age and gender. Thepresence of obesity in childhood andadolescence is associated with in-creased evidence of atherosclerosisat autopsy and of subclinical mea-sures of atherosclerosis on vascularimaging. Because of its strong asso-ciation with many of the other estab-lished risk factors for cardiovascu-lar disease, obesity is even morepowerfully correlated with athero-sclerosis; this association has beenshown for BP, dyslipidemia, and insu-lin resistance in each of the majorpediatric epidemiologic studies. Ofall the risk factors, obesity tracksmost strongly from childhood intoadult life. Improvement in weight sta-tus and decrease in body fatnesshave been shown to be associatedwith improvement in all the obesity-related risk factors and in subclini-cal vascular changes. Higher BMIduring childhood is directly associ-ated with increased coronary heartdisease in adult life.

The CDC growthcharts were not developed as a health-related standard. Instead, the growthcharts present percentiles of the BMIdistribution derived from measure-ments taken during several NationalHealth and Nutrition Examination Sur-veys as points of reference. Althoughthe charts were published in 2000, theyinclude selected data from the 1963through 1980 surveys and, thus, arenot representative of the US popula-tion in 2000. These BMI percentilegrowth charts provide the best refer-ence data available for describing nor-mal growth in US children. They are,however, a screening tool and not aninstrument for the diagnosis of over-weight and obesity.An expert committee jointly convenedby the American Medical Association(AMA), the CDC, and the Maternal andChild Health Bureau (MCHB) of theHealth Resources and Services Admin-istration (US Department of Health andHuman Services)16recently recom-mended that BMI be used to assessweight-for-height relationships in chil-dren. This conclusion was reached be-cause BMI can be easily calculatedfrom height and weight, correlatesstrongly with direct measures of bodyfat (especially at higher BMI values),associates only weakly with height,and identies those with the highestbody fat correctly with acceptable ac-curacy, particularly above the 85th BMIpercentile. Pediatric care providersneed a feasible standard for identify-ing overweight and obesity in theirpatients, because parents recognizeac h i l d ' so v e r w e i g h ts t a t u si nf e w e rthan half of the cases.

Each patient and familyshould be considered on an individ-ual basis in deciding how best to con-vey the seriousness of this issue andto develop management plans.Conclusions of the Evidence Review onPrevention of Overweight and ObesityWith Diet or Combined Diet andPhysical Activity InterventionsThe expert panel concluded that thereis good evidence that the dietary be-havior of children can safely be im-proved with interventions that resultin lower saturated fat intake, reducedintake of sweetened beverages, and in-creased fruit and vegetable consump-tion. In a small number of studies,these changes were associated withlower BMI. No evidence that diets ofthis kind are harmful was identied.Most studies also had specic inter-ventions aimed at changing physicalactivity behaviors, so it is difcult toseparate benets related to dietchange alone. Although calorie bal-ance is generally seen as a key issuefor weight control, intervention stud-ies that addressed both diet and phys-ical activity had mixed results, per-haps because most of them offeredrelatively weak interventions at thecommunity level rather than targetingindividual at-risk youths.The guideline recommendations fordiet and nutrition for ele-vated cardiovascular risk (CHILD-1)(Table 5-1;\"Nutrition and Diet\") specif-ically address optimizing the diet ineach of these areas as well as increas-ing intake of whole grains and match-ing energy intake to growth andexpenditure. For healthy children, im-plementation of the CHILD-1 dietaryrecommendations with monitoring ofBMI and dietary intake over timeshould be all that is needed from a nu-tritional standpoint to prevent obesity.No additional recommendations areindicated on the basis of this evidencereview.TABLE 9-11ContinuedStudy Authors, Type,and DurationMedication No. of Subjects, Gender, Condition Daily Dose Effect on Lipid Prole, %TC LDLCholesterolHDLCholesterolTriglyceridesAvis et al, RCT, 12 cholesterol/H11350190 mg/dL or LDL cholesterol/H11022160 mg/dL plus positive family history of earlyCVD or/H113502o t h e rr i s kf a c t o r sf o rC )5 history der to 53wkSimvastatin male oils (1 gper capsule)a\u20141-4 g/d 6 only one FDA-approved sh-oil preparation, but there are many generic forms of sh-oil capsules that are commercially available.

In asmall number of these studies, the in-tervention was effective. It should benoted that these successful interven-tions often addressed reduction insedentary behavior rather than at-tempts to increase physical activity. Ina majority of the studies there was nosignicant difference in body-size mea-sures. Sample sizes were often small,and follow-up was often short (fre-quently/H110216 months). It is suggestedthat gender-specic programs mightbe more successful in changing activitybehavior. Overall, the expert panel con-cluded that on the basis of the evidencereview, increasing activity in isolationis of little benet in preventing obesity.By contrast, the review suggests thatreducing sedentary behavior might bebenecial in preventing the develop-ment of obesity. The activity recom-mendations in the guideline speci-cally address limiting sedentarybehavior and increasing physical ac-tivity in all children. Guidance onamounts and intensity of physical ac-tivity and limitations on sedentaryscreen time are provided in the recom-mendations in \"Physical Activity.\" Onthe basis of this evidence review, physical activity in pre-venting obesity are for Use of 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A Inhibitors and AdolescentsPatient 9-1) risk-factor categories and 9-7) to select statin therapy for patients.2. Include preferences of patient and family in decision-making.3. In general, do not start treatment with statins before the age of 10 y (patients with high-risk family history, high-risk conditions, or multiple risk factors[Tables 9-6 and 9-7] might be considered for medication initiation at age/H1134910 y).4. Precaution/contraindication with potentially interactive azole antifungal agents,nefazodone, many HIV protease inhibitors); check for potential interaction with all current medications at baseline.5. Conduct baseline hepatic panel and CK before initiating treatment.Initiation and titration1. Choice of particular statin is a matter of preference. Clinicians are encouraged to develop familiarity and experience with one of the statins, includingdosage regimen and potential drug-drug interactions.2. Start with the lowest dose once daily, usually at bedtime. Atorvastatin and rosuvastatin can be taken in the morning or evening because of their longhalf-lives.3. Measure baseline CK, ALT, and AST.4. Instruct the patient to report all potential adverse effects, especially muscle cramps, weakness, asthenia, and more diffuse symptoms suggestive ofmyopathy.5. Advise female patients about concerns with pregnancy and the need for appropriate contraception.6. Advise about potential future medication interactions, especially cyclosporine, niacin, bric acid derivatives, erythromycin, azole antifungal agents,nefazodone, and HIV protease inhibitors.Check for potential interaction whenever any new medication is initiated.1. Whenever potential myopathy symptoms are present, stop medication and assess CK; determine relation to recent physical activity. The threshold forworrisome level of CK is 10 times above the upper limit of reported normal, considering the impact of physical activity. Monitor the patient for resolutionof myopathy symptoms and any associated increase in CK level. Consideration can be given to restarting the medication once symptoms and laboratoryabnormalities have resolved.2. After 4 wk, measure FLP, ALT, and AST and compare with laboratory-specic reported normal values.The threshold for worrisome levels of ALT or AST is/H113503 times the upper limit of reported normal.Target levels for LDL cholesterol: minimal,/H11021130 mg/dL; ideal,/H11021110 mg/dL.3. If target LDL cholesterol levels are achieved and there are no potential myopathy symptoms or laboratory abnormalities, continue therapy and recheck FLP,ALT, and AST in 8 wk and then in 3 mo.4. If laboratory abnormalities are noted or symptoms are reported, temporarily withhold the medication and repeat the blood work in 2 wk. Whenabnormalities resolve, the medication may be restarted with close monitoring.5. If target LDL cholesterol levels are not achieved, increase the dose by 1 increment (usually 10 mg) and repeat the blood work in 4 wk. If target LDLcholesterol levels are still not achieved, dose may be further increased by 1 increment, or another agent (bile acid sequestrant or cholesterol absorptioninhibitor) may be added under the direction of a lipid specialist.Maintenance monitoring1. Monitor growth (height, weight, and BMI relative to normal growth charts), sexual maturation, and development.2. Whenever potential myopathy symptoms present, stop medication and assess CK.3. Monitor FLP, ALT, and AST every 3-4 mo in the rst year, every 6 mo in the second year and beyond, and whenever clinically indicated.4. Monitor and encourage compliance with lipid-lowering dietary and medication therapy. Serially assess and counsel for other risk factors such as weightgain, smoking, and inactivity.5. Counsel adolescent girls about statin contraindications in pregnancy and the need for abstinence or use of appropriate contraceptive measures. Use of oralcontraceptives is not contraindicated if medically appropriate. Seek referral to an adolescent medicine or gynecologic specialist as appropriate.CK aspartate PANEL by Susan Walker on September 10, 2012pediatrics.aappublications.orgDownloaded from Summary of the Evidence Reviewof Children at Increased Risk forOverweight and ObesityCertain populations of children whoare of normal weight are at risk fordeveloping overweight and obesity asthey grow older. Observational studieshave identied risk factors that putthese children at greater risk; how-ever, research is lacking regarding anappropriate intervention. Despite thatfact, epidemiologic associations sug-gest that primary care providersshould be alert to increasing BMItrends and excessive weight gain be-yond what is anticipated for height in-crease when dealing with these chil-dren and consider intervention beforethe child becomes overweight.Observational studies have identiedsample populations that are at specialrisk for obesity:children with a BMI between the85th and 95th percentiles;children in whom there is a positivefamily history of obesity in 1 or bothparents;early onset of increasing weight be-yond that appropriate for increase inheight, which can be identied early(beginning in the rst year of life);excessive increase in weight duringadolescence, particularly in blackgirls; andchildren who have been very activeand then become inactive or adoles-cents who are inactive in general(an example would be a child whopreviously participated in organizedsports and has stopped, particu-larly in adolescence).No RCTs that addressed these popula-tions were identied. Despite this fact,the expert panel believes that lifestylerecommendations with a goal of pre-vention of excessive weight gain areneeded for normal-weight childrenwith characteristics consistent withspecial risk for development of over-weight and obesity. The diet and activ-ity recommendations proposed forchildren at elevated cardiovascularrisk (\"Nutrition and Diet\"; \"Physical Ac-tivity\") should be vigorously reinforcedin these children.

DM AND OTHER CONDITIONSPREDISPOSING TO THEDEVELOPMENT OF ACCELERATEDATHEROSCLEROSISDM is an established risk factor CVD. Metabolically, DM charac-terized by hyperglycemia (T1DM)and and with vascular disease. Resultsof autopsy and noninvasive imagingstudies suggest that the extent of vas-cular involvement reflects the dura-tion of the disease and the severity ofthe chronic metabolic derangement.The epidemiologies of ayounger age; 25% of patients are diag-nosed between the ages of 5 and 10years and another 40% between theages of 10 and 15 years. If not treatedadequately, the degree of hyperglyce-mia is severe, and patients are highlysymptomatic. By contrast, with T2DM,the majority of patients present inadult life, but a small and growingnumber present in adolescence, andmost are relatively asymptomatic withonly mild-to-moderate hyperglycemiain combination with obesity. Regard-less of these differences, children withDM, type 1 or 2, are at signicantly in-creased risk for accelerated athero-sclerosis and early CVD.In certain other pediatric diseasestates, the process of atherosclerosisis dramatically accelerated with clini-cal coronary events occurring in child-hood and very early adult life. Theseconditions were the subject of a recentguideline from the American Heart As-sociation (AHA).17The expert panelelected to use the AHA guideline as atemplate for developing recommenda-tions for children with conditions suchas DM that predispose them to very ac-celerated atherosclerosis, becausethe evidence review identied only asmall number of studies that ad-dressed these conditions in an RCT.Conclusions of the EvidenceReview for DM and OtherPredisposing ConditionsChildren with DM, T1DM or T2DM, repre-sent the prototype of the child at specialrisk for accelerated atherosclerosis andearly clinical CVD. To maximize identica-tion of T2DM in adoles-cence, the screening algorithm from theAmerican Association18is rec-ommended in all children(Table 11-1).Limited high-quality studies that ad-SUPPLEMENT ARTICLES PEDIATRICS Volume 128, Supplement 5, December 2011S251 by Susan Walker on September 10, 2012pediatrics.aappublications.orgDownloaded from dressed cardiovascular risk reductionin children with conditions predispos-ing them to accelerated atherosclero-sis were found, so the expert panelelected to modify the recommenda-tions of an expert pediatric panel con-vened by the AHA that published itsrecommendations for risk-factor man-agement in 2006; these recommenda-tions have been endorsed by the AAPand are included in the guideline data-base for these guidelines.17The authors of the AHA statement rec-ommended specic risk identicationand management stratied accordingto risk on the basis of dened otherconditions that parallel the recom-mendations for adults with DM orother CVD equivalents. For those in thehigh-risk category (Table 11-2), the dis-ease process has been associatedwith clinical coronary disease before30 years of age. For those in themoderate-risk category, the diseaseprocess has been shown to be associ-ated with pathologic, physiologic, orsubclinical evidence of acceleratedatherosclerosis.The expert panel believes that theserecommendations should be used forthe management of children and ado-lescents with DM and other predispos-ing conditions as outlined in the algo-rithm in Fig 11-1 and in Tables 11-2 and11-3. With the growing evidence of vas-cular disease in children with T2DM,the expert panel felt that it was pru-dent to include both T1DM and T2DM inthe high-risk category. With increasingevidence of vascular dysfunction inchildren with HIV infection and ne-phrotic syndrome, these 2 conditionshave been added to the selected dis-ease settings in the moderate-risk cat-egory. Patients in the high-risk cate-gory require intensive managementwith more aggressive goals for ther-apy than those in the moderate-riskcategory, as outlined in RISK-FACTOR CLUSTERING ANDTHE demonstrate clustering inyouth.

Treat-ment of cardiovascular risk-factor clus-tering in youth has not been thoroughlyevaluated, but maintenance of low levelsof cardiovascular risk factors starting inchildhood is associated with a lowerprevalence of CVD and increased longev-ity in adult life.RECOMMENDATIONS RISK-FACTORCLUSTERING THE it identies a phenotypein pediatrics. However, absence of etiology, lack of consensuson denition, and the paucity of high-level evidence addressing managementin childhood led the expert panel to con-clude that the metabolic syndromeshould not be considered as a separaterisk factor in childhood and adoles-cence. Prevention of obesity is the mostimportant strategy for lowering theprevalence of metabolic syndrome inadults, and this seems strongly applica-ble in childhood (see \"Overweight andObesity\"). Given the strong relationshipof obesity and physical inactivity to themetabolic syndrome and insulin resis-tance, the expert panel makes the follow-ing recommendations. Because of thepaucity of evidence available, the recom-mendations are a consensus of the ex-pert panel (grade D).The presence of any combination ofmultiple risk factors should prompt in-tensication of therapy with an empha-sis on lifestyle modication to metabolic syndrome of specic evaluation for allother cardiovascular risk factors in-cluding family history of prematureCVD, hypertension, dyslipidemia,DM, and tobacco exposure.The coexistence of obesity with anyother major cardiovascular risk fac-tor should be recognized by clini-cians as a setting in which:intensive weight reduction shouldbe undertaken per the recommen-dations in \"Overweight and Obe-sity,\" along with management ofidentied including ini-tiation of therapy,per and sleepapnea should be undertaken.These recommendations are supportedby the knowledge that cardiovascu-lar morbidity has a continuous rela-tionship across therisk-distributionspectrum and that a youth with multi-ple borderline risk factors might, infact, have risk equivalent to a personwith extreme abnormality of a singlemajor risk factor. A presentation suchas this should lead to intense nutritionand exercise management with closefollow-up, and if lifestyle interventionis unsuccessful, consideration shouldbe given to endocrine referral.

PERINATAL FACTORSIncreasing evidence links prenatal expo-sures to adverse health outcomes. Peri-natal risk reduction is an area in whichpediatric care providers can potentiallybe effective, because they are often theonly physicians whom a mother sees be-tween pregnancies. The expert panelidentied 3 potential areas for consider-ation: maternal obesity; choice of neona-tal feeding method; and maternal smok-ing cessation. Maternal obesity isassociated with gestational DM, higherbirth weight, childhood obesity mea-sured by increased BMI, and increasedrisk of the metabolic syndrome andT2DM in offspring. However, the expertpanel could not identify any prepreg-nancy or postpartum studies that ad-dressed maternal obesity in a pediatriccare setting, and more general ap-proaches to preventing or treating obe-sity in women of reproductive age arebeyond the scope of this report. A de-tailed discussion of childhood obesity it-self is the subject of \"Overweight andObesity.\" With regard to choice of neona-tal feeding method, the cardiovascularadvantages of breastfeeding as the pri-mary source of nutrition for infants areemphasized in \"Nutrition and Diet.\"Therefore, the evidence review for thissection is focused on maternal smokingcessation.Conclusions and Grading of theEvidence Review on MaternalSmoking CessationThe expert panel found that strongevidence supports a benet for in-terventions directed at maternalsmoking cessation during pregnancy(grade A). Weaker evidence suggeststhat these interventions do not pre-vent relapse after delivery. Trials ofcessation in the postpartum period,which would be the most applicable topediatric providers, have been limitedin number and suggest that for ma-ternal smoking cessation to be sus-tained, specic continued support inthe pediatric care setting is required.No smoking-cessation interventionshave resulted in any reported ad-verse effects related to the interven-tions (no grade).The expert panel believes that pediat-ric care providers can play a role inhelping mothers to remain smoke-free or to quit smoking in the inter-pregnancy interval. For most women,this interval will extend to the earlyrst trimester of any subsequentpregnancy. The pediatric well-childschedule calls for/H1101110 visits in therst 2 years of life, and mothers at-tend most of those visits, so the pedi-atric care provider usually seeswomen in this period more than anyother health care professional. Pedi-atric care providers often have a sus-tained relationship with the motherand her infant, and many already ad-vocate for parental smoking cessa-tion in their efforts topromote asmoke-free environment for chil-dren. Pediatric providers and/ortheir staff need to be trained to ei-ther deliver or refer to a long-termmaternal smoking-cessation pro-gram (no grade).Recommendations for maternal smok-ing cessation are listed in Table 13-1.TABLE 12-1Metabolic Syndrome Component Levels for Evaluation of Children level, abovenormal for gender, race, andpubertal status, is consideredevidence of insulin resistanceNHANES indicates National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; ADA, American Diabetes Association.TABLE 13-1Evidence-Based Recommendations for Maternal Smoking CessationSmoking-cessation guidance during pregnancy is strongly advised Grade A, strongly recommendSupportive action:Pediatric care providers should be provided with appropriatetraining and materials to deliver, or refer to, a smoking-cessation program in the postpartum period for all smokingwomen of childbearing ageThis intervention should be directly linked to ongoing smoke-free home recommendations directed at all young mothers andfathers as described in the \"Tobacco Exposure\" sectionGradesreflect the ndings of the evidence consensus opinion of the expertpanel; andsupportive actionsrepresent expert consensus suggestions from the expert panel provided to supportimplementation of the recommendations (they are not graded).SUPPLEMENT ARTICLES PEDIATRICS Volume 128, Supplement 5, December 2011S255 by Susan Walker on September 10, 2012pediatrics.aappublications.orgDownloaded from REFERENCES1.
