There are so many allergens in the air around this time of the year, so while it might be a wonderful time of the year, it can be miserable for kids who suffer from allergies. When symptoms appear, many parents will purchase over the counter medicines such as antihistamines and nasal sprays. While these do help relieve the symptoms, they carry side effects, such as drowsiness, and might not be suitable for every kid. Therefore, we have put together a list of the top natural allergy medicines for kids.
