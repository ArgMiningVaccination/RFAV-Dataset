Includes issues of diet, behaviour, personality and common ailments. Description Can a two-year-old survive on bread alone? How do you set boundaries for a three-year-old, and should you? What about TV, tidiness or punishment? After the challenges of the first year of a baby's life, many parents might feel that things should settle down a little. The opposite is normally true! Years one to four throw up many more questions with which lots of parents struggle. This practical guide takes a holistic approach to the growth and development of a toddler. Written by doctors qualified in both conventional and anthroposophical medicine, it deals with all aspects of the care of a child up to the age of four. Broken down into short, comprehensive chapters spanning different periods of development, it covers issues such as eating, diet and growth, common ailments, behaviour and discipline, personality, and the development of creative and practical skills. For first-time parents of a toddler, this book is an ideal reference and life-saver in tricky situations. Veteran parents may find its alternative, holistic approach refreshing in comparison to other standard texts. This book is a companion to Baby's First Year, and the bestselling A Guide to Child Health. Reviews 'This fresh approach covers imaginative play, the child and the seasons, and telling stories to young children, as well as touching on the important issues of gentle discipline and routine, and practical matters surrounding a natural diet, toilet training and safety. The authors emphasis that a warm and living nest and respect for their child's personality are essential. There is a substantial chapter on looking after ill children which offers home remedies as well as indicating where a doctor's care is required.' -- Mel Tibbs, Juno Magazine Author Paulien Bom is a care and nursing consultant in Amsterdam.
