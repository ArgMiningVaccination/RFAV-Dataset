Homeopathy is a complementary form of medicine that has been used for over 200 years. Its founder, Samuel Hahnemann, a German physician, based his system on the theory that 'like cures like'. Today, Homeopathic remedies are prepared using the same principles Hahnemann described in his Organon of Medicine. He was truly a visionary, dispelling the theories of disease tenaciously held by his contemporaries and the harmful treatments applied in his day. He adhered to the principle that 'The highest aim of cure is to restore health gently and permanently, according to comprehensible principles, in the shortest and safest manner.' For Hahnemann, the 'safest manner' of administering medicine was to dilute the active ingredient in water making it non-toxic. What will my treatment involve? Homeopathic medicine treats the individual not the disease. Therefore the Homeopath will want to find out as much about you as she can in order to find a suitable treatment for you. During a consultation with your Homeopath you will be asked to describe your symptoms, lifestyle, and medical history and perhaps life-changing events that you know have impacted not only on your physical health but also on your mental and emotional well-being. All of the symptoms you describe will be linked to treat you as a whole, possibly with a single prescription. Remedies may be given in liquid or tablet form and are given with comprehensive instructions on how to take them. A consultation generally lasts 90 minutes, giving you time and space to discuss your health issue, but also to discover ways you could improve and maintain your health. Follow up appointments are usually made 4-6 weeks apart and there are opportunities to 'check in' with your Homeopath should you need a quick reassurance or some clarification on your treatment. How could I or my family benefit from Homeopathy? We see patients for a variety of reasons for example, people who may be experiencing a stressful period in their life such as divorce, bereavement or redundancy. Others may present with more physical symptoms such as childhood illnesses, skin problems or menopausal symptoms. As Homeopathy is a holistic form of medicine it is important to stress that as Homeopaths we do not diagnose or treat specific illnesses. If you would like to discuss whether Homeopathy can help you we offer a free telephone consultation where you can ask further questions. Homeopathy is not intended as a substitute for medical advice or treatment. If you are unsure, or have any concerns, please consult your GP first. "}
