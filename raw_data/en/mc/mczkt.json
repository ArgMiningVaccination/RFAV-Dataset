Surprise! You've got guests coming over in twenty minutes and your kitchen is a royal mess! First things first - hide everything you can in the dishwasher or the oven, then deal with the piles of junk mail on the countertop and finally (hopefully!), you've got time for a quick scrub of the counter tops and sinks. Been there? LOL - you've never seen me clean so fast! Homemade Fizzy Scouring Powder My go-to cleaning product for this type of situation is a DIY scouring powder that works fast and leaves my kitchen smelling fantastic! It's made with just a few non-toxic, affordable ingredients - baking soda, kosher salt (optional), citric acid and a citrus based essential oil. The best part is that this scouring powder fizzes on contact with water - there's something about that fizz that convinces me the job is getting done! It's enough to make you smile, even when unexpected guests are about to arrive! Have a listen! About the ingredients I may receive commissions from purchases made through affiliate links in this article including Amazon Affiliates. [Full Disclosure](https://mindfulmomma.com/privacy-policy/) Baking soda is a natural deodorizer and provides a nonabrasive grit for scrubbing. Kosher salt is a deodorizer, water softener and has a nice scrub. I've listed this ingredient as optional because salt can pit stainless steel if left for long periods of time. If you wash it off right away (on a stovetop or sink) this shouldn't be a problem. Citric acid is a naturally occurring acid that works as a disinfectant and cleanser, and is helpful for removing soap scum and water stains. It's also the ingredient that creates the all important fizz! You can buy citric acid in bulk at many co-ops or natural food stores or find [citric acid online](https://www.amazon.com/Milliard-Citric-Acid-Pound-VERIFIED/dp/B00EYFKM32?keywords=citric%2Bacid&qid=1682699865&sr=8-3-spons&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExTEVNSlQ2NDY2VFcxJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMjY5MjU2MlhRRjdVUE5WSFNMQSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUExMEUzNThLSFRJMklFJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=mindmomm099-20&linkId=5e2bd757b5afe938b7be5f92cda87e21&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl). FYI - citric acid is given an A rating on the EWG's Guide to Healthy Cleaning - so no worries there! Many essential oils are naturally antibacterial, making them great additions to homemade cleaning products. Personally, I love [grapefruit essential oil](https://www.amazon.com/Brooklyn-Botany-Grapefruit-Essential-Oil/dp/B09KVKN5Z2?fst=as%3Aoff&keywords=grapefruit%2Bessential%2Boil&qid=1682699974&s=beauty&sr=1-2&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=mindmomm099-20&linkId=f8d70d1f9a85ab49eb082d3b7e3b3f12&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) for cleaning - because it leaves such a bright, uplifting scent behind! Imagine you just ripped open a fresh grapefruit and the oil from the peel sprayed into the air and you'll know what I mean! Grapefruit oil also helps overcome anxiety and stress (those unexpected guests!) and is energizing and uplifting, which is always a good thing. Uses for fizzy scouring powder Another reason to love this great-smelling, fizzy scouring powder is that it is a mega multi-tasker! Here are a few ways to use it: - Sink scrub (both kitchen and bath) - Countertop cleanser - Stove top cleaner - Bathtup scrubber - Toilet cleaner and freshener - Drain freshener The recipe 1/2 cup baking soda 3 Tablespoons citric acid 1 Tablespoon coarse Kosher salt 10 drops grapefruit essential oil Mix all ingredients together in a bowl. You may need to use your fingers to get the essential oil properly mixed in! Transfer powder to a container with holes in the top if you have one. A [glass or stainless steel cheese shaker](https://www.amazon.com/Tablecraft-CECOMINHK02524-Cheese-Shaker/dp/B0000CF5GV?keywords=cheese+shaker&qid=1682700079&sr=8-5&linkCode=ll1&tag=mindmomm099-20&linkId=d4b08e87f69a26517c87387bc1383983&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) works best - preferably one with a cover to keep out the air when you are not using it! Don't sweat it if you don't have a shaker, just keep the powder in a sealed container and pour some out as needed. So next time you have unexpected guests, don't let them stress you out!
