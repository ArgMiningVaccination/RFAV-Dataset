[Cold and flu season is here](https://abundanthealthstl.com/blog/3-tips-for-staying-healthy-this-holiday-season/). And wouldn't you know it, one of my favorite ways to boost your immune system is through chiropractic care. When your immune system needs a boost, an adjustment can be a great starting place. So let's talk about 3 ways chiropractic care can benefit your immune system! It Allows Proper Communication With Your Immune System Your nervous system is primarily housed in your spine. It communicates with the rest of your body and when your spine is misaligned, it causes a disruption in this pathway. When your immune system needs to take action, by way of releasing antibodies, discharging hormones, or increasing the production of white blood cells, it's important that this pathway is prepared to deliver that message without disruption. Regular adjustments help keep the spine in alignment and reduce nerve interference. It Helps Prepare Your Body For Illness Little known fact: Chiropractic care involves more than the spine! Chiropractic care focuses on optimizing whole-body function. When you get sick, this means optimizing your ability to fight off the germs attacking your body quickly, effectively, and thoroughly. Relying on medication to handle these germy invaders doesn't train your systems to fight off the bug should it attack your systems again. By naturally preparing your body with regular adjustments, the next time your body needs to fend off a bug it will kick into gear and quickly eradicate the invader - hopefully before you even reason it was there! It Decreases Stress Studies have shown that heightened stress levels and lack of sleep can have huge effects on our immune systems. Chiropractic care helps reduce stress hormones that compromise our immune responses, while also improving function and mobility. We've seen this decrease in stress also result in a mindset shift for patients as they realize they don't need to rely on another medication to feel better, instead, they can proactively optimize their immune systems to benefit whole body health and wellness.
