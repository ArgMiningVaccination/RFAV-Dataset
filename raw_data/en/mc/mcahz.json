Tamariki younger than 12 years can get the paediatric Pfizer vaccine. [Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in children 5 years old and over.](/medicines-a-z/c/covid-19-vaccine-in-children/) The number of doses you need and the gap between the doses will depend on your age, whether you are getting your primary vaccine course or your booster, and whether you have a weakened immune system or not.

You should not receive Novavax vaccine if you have had a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to this vaccine or its ingredients. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have recently received other vaccines; some need a 3-day gap before or after Novavax. You can book your appointment to receive the Novavax vaccine at [BookMyVaccine.nz(external link)](https://bookmyvaccine.covid19.health.nz/) If you select Novavax, a list of places where Novavax can be given will be displayed. Not all vaccination centres, clinics or pharmacies will have this vaccine. If you're unable to book online, you can call the COVID Vaccination Healthline on [0800 28 29 26](tel:0800282926) (8am-8pm, 7 days a week).

If you get Novavax for the first injection, then you should also get it (and not the Pfizer vaccine) for the second dose and booster to complete your vaccination course. If your first dose was Pfizer, you will need a prescription if you want to have Novavax for your next dose. Visits to a GP for a Novavax prescription are free. If you're pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, talk to your healthcare provider about the Novavax vaccine. There is limited data about the Novavax vaccine during pregnancy or while breastfeeding so the Pfizer vaccine is the preferred choice at these times. Talk to your healthcare provider about this. Read more about [COVID-19 vaccination and pregnancy](/medicines-a-z/c/covid-19-vaccination-and-pregnancy/). Like all vaccines, the Novavax vaccine can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them. It's important to drink plenty of fluids after your vaccination, and to rest - avoid going to the gym or strenuous exercise for a day or two afterwards. Side effects are more commonly reported after a second dose. |Side effects||What should I do?| | || | | || | | || | |Did you know that you can report a side effect to a medicine to CARM (Centre for Adverse Reactions Monitoring)? | Serious allergic reactions can occur but they are extremely rare. New Zealand vaccinators are trained to manage these. Most people with a history of anaphylaxis to other medicines, vaccines, foods and venom can be safely vaccinated. Signs of an allergic reaction include skin rash, itching, swelling of your lips, face and mouth, or difficulty breathing or speaking. - A trained healthcare professional will observe you for at least 15 minutes after being given the vaccine - If these symptoms develop after that, go straight to the emergency department at your nearest hospital, or call 111 if your hospital is not nearby. There have been very rare reports of [myocarditis](/health-a-z/m/myocarditis/), pericarditis or both (myopericarditis) occurring after vaccination with the Novavax vaccine. Myocarditis is inflammation affecting the heart muscle. Pericarditis is inflammation of the lining around the heart. Myopericarditis is a mixture of myocarditis and pericarditis. Although this side effect is rare, it can be serious. Symptoms of myocarditis or pericarditis linked to the vaccine generally appear within a few days, and mostly within the first few weeks after having the vaccine. Myocarditis is more likely to occur following a COVID-19 infection than after receiving the vaccine.
