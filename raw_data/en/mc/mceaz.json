Don't expose your medicine to direct sunlight, magnets, or strong aromatic odors such as camphor, solvents, paint, and chemicals. Avoid taking food immediately before or after the medicine. It should be dissolved on a clean tongue, when the mouth is free from any other strongly flavored things like tobacco, garlic, onion, ginger, cigarette, pan, gutka, minty tooth paste, camphor, coffee etc. Strong odors or tastes may interfere with the action of medicine. The half an hour rule - Do not eat or drink anything half an hour before and after taking the medicines. That means if you wish to take medicine at 8 o'clock then do not consume anything from 7.30 to 8, take the medicine at 8 o' clock and then till 8.30 do not consume anything. The only exception to this rule is water. Drinking water is permissible after or before five minutes of taking the medicines. Once you are following the half an hour rule then you can eat raw onion, garlic, ginger, and other strong smelling substances along with the homeopathic medicines. Formation of hypothesis: A rational explanation that disease are cured by medicines that have the power to excite a similar affections was put forward.This lead to the formation of a hypothesis which further become a thesis. Avoid touching the medicine with your hands in case you have recently handled a strong smelling substance. Touch the globules only with clean hands if you must. They should be tipped into the container cap or clean paper or a clean spoon and dropped into the mouth to avoid contamination of the medicine. To obtain best absorption, tablets or globules should be chewed or sucked, not swallowed whole. While taking drops, pour them into a spoon or a glass containing a little water which is as pure as possible. Keep this solution obtained in the mouth for a few seconds before swallowing. Strictly follow the regime of medicine. While under homeopathic treatment for chronic illness, it is best to notify your homeopath before taking any new medications or other homeopathic remedies. An exception to this is a first aid or emergency situation, in which case you should take the appropriate remedy or action immediately and call your practitioner afterwards. If you are traveling with homeopathic remedies, take them as carryon luggage and hand them to the attendant when your luggage goes through the airport x-ray machine. Homeopaths have observed repeatedly that certain substances or influences can disturb the vital force resulting in an interference with the action of the homeopathic medicine. This phenomenon is known as antidoting. When antidoting occurs, the healing effects of the remedy will stop, either temporarily or permanently, and your symptoms will return, partially or completely. The relapse may be sudden or gradual. It is unknown why these substances interfere with the effect of homeopathic remedies. Antidoting may occur at any time, even two years after a remedy has been given, if you are particularly sensitive to the substance or the effect of the exposure is strong enough to affect your vital force. Many homeopathic practitioners estimate that the treatment of approximately 60 percent of their patients will be adversely affected by ingesting coffee. Your homeopath may recommend that you avoid coffee entirely or may say nothing at all until the treatment has been successful. These are the guidelines that we give to our patients based on our own clinical experience. What is most important is that that you follow the instructions of your homeopath in this matter. WHAT TO AVOID WHILE UNDER HOMEOPATHIC TREATMENT Addictions - Do not smoke, chew tobacco, and drink alcohol while you are taking homeopathic medicines, as it may have nullifying effects on the medicines. Coffee - This is the one substance that most often interferes with homeopathic treatment. Even one sip of coffee or a small amount of coffee ice cream, or coffee candy may be sufficient to disturb the treatment. It appears to be the oils in coffee rather than the caffeine that is the culprit. Other caffeinated substances, although not considered healthy, do not usually interfere with homeopathic treatment. Electric blankets - They affect the action of remedies by altering your body's electromagnetic field. Aromatic substances - Avoid camphor, eucalyptus, menthol, and any products that contain them including Vick's, Noxema, Tiger Balm, Ben Gay, Calamine lotion, and cough drops and lozenges containing these substances. This includes aromatherapy oils as well as mouthwash containing menthol and other aromatic compounds. Citronella oil, pennyroyal, and other aromatic herbal mosquito repellants, all thuja and tea tree products, peppermint oil, and lavender oil may interfere due to their aromaticity. Chapstick, Blistex, and other aromatic lip balms should also be avoided, although fruit-flavored balms are fine. Strong fumes from oil based paint, turpentine, paint thinner and certain household cleaning agents such as Pine Sol, Lysol, and strong smelling industrial chemicals may also interfere, depending on individual sensitivity. Medications - Homeopathic medicines will not prevent prescription drugs from working, but prescription drugs may interfere with homeopathic remedies. These include antibiotics, cortisone, and anti-fungal, whether topical or oral. Consult with your practitioner about any drugs that you are taking. She might ask to consult with the prescribing physician. Immunizations - Immunization sometimes interrupt the homeopathic healing process in certain individuals. Whether you take them or not is your personal choice, however you may want to discuss each specific immunization and your particular circumstances with your homeopath. Dental work - Dental drilling and the use of novocaine may disturb the effects of homeopathic remedies. It is preferable, if possible, to wait at least three or four months after taking a remedy to have dental work done, which gives your vital force more time to be strengthened by homeopathy. In the case of emergency dental work, have it done and call your homeopath afterwards. In many cases, homeopathic remedies will relieve dental pain until you have a chance to visit your dentist. Drugs - Avoid all recreational drugs including marijuana, cocaine, LSD, barbituates, and amphetamines. Alcohol in moderation is not a problem. Other homeopathic remedies - Do not use Bach Flower remedies, cell salts, or other homeopathic remedies without discussing them with your homeopath first. Herbs - Check with your homeopath before using herbs for specific medicinal purposes. Herb teas for beverage use, when varied from day to day, are fine, as are culinary herbs. Chinese herbs may antidote remedies in some cases. If you've been given Natrum muriaticum, you will be advised to avoid peppermint in all forms, including tea. There may be other specific substances that your homeopath will ask you to avoid when taking a particular remedy. Vitamins - Let your homeopath know which vitamins you are taking. Using a particular vitamin to eliminate a particular symptom may make it difficult for your homeopath to evaluate your symptoms. Multivitamins and minerals usually do not disturb homeopathic treatment. Beauty treatments - Permanent waves often interfere with remedies because of the harsh and aromatic chemicals. Electrolysis and aromatic facial and skin products and treatments are usually not compatible with homeopathy. Other therapies - Acupuncture and therapeutic ultrasound have been known to disturb homeopathic treatment. Please discuss this with your practitioner. The Patient's Freedom during Homeopathic Treatment - you may feel that the list of potential antidotes places too many restrictions on your life and makes you feel rebellious. Most patients who choose homeopathy find that it becomes relatively easy to avoid these substances and that allowing their remedies to work over time is well worth the effort. They find that the increased freedom in their lives resulting from homeopathy is greater than the freedom to drink coffee or use menthol. If you do feel too restricted by your homeopathic treatment, discuss this with your practitioner. Perhaps you are avoiding some substances unnecessarily. FACTORS WHICH DO NOT INTERFERE WITH HOMEOPATHIC TREATMENT Medications - A few NSAIDS will usually not interfere with homeopathic treatment. For Prescriptions compatible or incompatible with homeopathy please check with your homeopath. Heating pads and water bed heaters. Medical tests - Blood tests, x-rays, mammograms, Pap smears. Dental examination and cleaning (except ultrasonic cleaning). Cleaning products - Ammonia and bleach. Personal care products - Most toothpastes, deodorants that are not strongly aromatic, aftershaves without menthol. Soaps, perfumes, and colognes that do not contain the substances listed. Be sure to read the labels carefully. Therapies - Massage (using non-aromatic oils), chiropractic adjustments and other forms of bodywork are generally compatible with homeopathy. If your complaints are primarily musculoskeletal, it is best to discuss the frequency of these treatments with your homeopath. \"All these things must be eliminated or else avoided as much as possible if cure is not to be prevented or impeded.\" Samuel Hahnemann, Organon of Medicine, Sixth Edition. OTHER DIETARY RESTRICTIONS: It is not mandatory for homeopathic treatment to follow certain dietary restrictions exceptionally for homeopathic medicines. But for diseases like bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, gout, or the disease which the intensity of which increases after taking a certain food items you need to follow the dietary restrictions for some period till you start responding to the homeopathic line of treatment. Once you respond curatively to homeopathic line of treatment there is no need to keep on the dietetic restrictions. That is the actual cure what homeopathy gives. OTHER MEDICATIONS: Allopathic - if you are a blood pressure, diabetes, epilepsy patient and if you are taking certain medicines for longer period of time then it is not advisable to stop the medicines abruptly as you may encounter problems if you do that. Once you start responding positively to homeopathic treatment then your homeopath will advise curtail down of your medicines. Ayurvedic - Most of the Ayurvedic medicines and homeopathic medicines have the same source only the preparation differs. Because of that it is better to confront your doctor which Ayurvedic medicine (along with the contents of it) you are taking. If the medicines have adverse reactions to each other then your homeopath will advise you to stop the Ayurvedic medicines. \u00d7 Vital Homoeopathy Home About Us Vital homoeopathy profile Dr. Anand Rao Mengji Our Mission Medical Ethics Articles and publications Press and media Why Homoeopathy?
