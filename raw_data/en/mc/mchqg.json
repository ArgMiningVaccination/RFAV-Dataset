Traditional foods have a historic tie to a certain culture or region, often passed down from generation to generation. From Indian curry to Italian rag\u00f9, these meals hold strong connections to their places of origin with delicious flavors and spices! Traditional dishes are nutrient-dense and often free of processed ingredients, relying on whole foods such as grains, meat and poultry, fish, legumes, nuts, and seeds. Traditional foods can provide connection and comfort, especially if a person grew up eating those foods, which impacts a person's [bio-individual](https://www.integrativenutrition.com/blog/2019/09/tips-for-embracing-bio-individual-nutrition) health - the foods and lifestyle practices that allow them to thrive as their unique selves. Food is so much more than just fuel for your body - the quality and preparation of traditional foods, in particular, can have a profound effect on one's emotional and spiritual well-being. Depending on your upbringing, traditions, and cultural practices, you may gravitate toward certain flavors and dishes, especially during the holiday season. These familiar foods can be reminiscent of love, family tradition, and sometimes even hardship. Cooking and enjoying these dishes as an adult can instill a sense of pride in the roots that shaped who you are today. Doris Dahdouh, an Integrative Nutrition Health Coach and IIN admissions representative, shares her take on traditional foods: \"Traditional foods are not only historical but can give you a personal glimpse into someone's journal. It tells a story about where a person came from, how they grew up, and what sort of things matter for that family during a holiday, a season, or even an illness. There are a lot of things people may not agree on these days. But the one thing I think we can all agree on is that a taste of a traditional dish can give a feeling that transports us back in time. It's a beautiful thing.\" Traditional foods are often viewed as being heavier dishes served in larger portions and can be cooked with ample dairy and animal fat, meat, or carbohydrates. Traditional foods are often served family style, and some foods may be reserved for special occasions where that meal is the only one of the day. However, it's important to remember the cultures from which these traditional foods originate, such as where in the world they're located, what foods are available during each season, and how food is used as a vehicle for both celebration and mourning. The lifestyle practices and nutritional choices of each culture are different and will suit their specific needs - that's bio-individuality in action! Some of your favorite traditional dishes might include ingredients that are encouraged to be eaten in moderation - such as heavy cream, red meat, or butter - but that doesn't mean those dishes should be avoided! The emotional benefits of enjoying a home-cooked meal with family, friends, and loved ones, during the holidays or not, strengthen your connections to community and spirituality, and go a long way in promoting overall health. As a legume that has been eaten for over 7,500 years, chickpeas are a staple in hearty stews, dips, and rice-based dishes.
