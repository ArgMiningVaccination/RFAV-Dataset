Welcomes, apologies, declarations of inter est, and approval of the agenda Jonathan welcomed everyone to the meeting, noting that this was Mark 's first face -to-face meeting as Chief Executive Officer. Jonathan said that for future meetings two or three Steering Group members would be identified to address each portfolio, in order to focus more fully on individual items. There were no additional dec larations of interest or items for the agenda. 2. Co-Chairs ' report Jeremy reported that the first ever Colloquium in 1993 had taken place a few feet from the UK Cochrane Centre where the Steering Group was now meeting. In the light of Cochrane's first 20 years he highlighted the developments of the appointment of the new CEO and the signing of the new publishing contract with Wiley. In relation to the new contract he congratulated those who had been involved in the negotiations and recognised the significant contributions of David , Mark and other staff members of the CEU and COU. The first meeting of the Cochrane- Wiley publishing management team had taken place on 6 March 2013 (see item 7.2 below) . Mark's proposed restructuring of the COU/CEU, which had already been tabled for the Steering Group at its meeting at the end of February , had now been discussed on 16 March at the meeting of centrally funded staff (see item 3.4 below) . The response to Mark's proposal had been very positive, and Jonat han congratulated him for his vision which had energised those present, in terms of the type of direction and how to realise that vision . The engagement of the centrally funded staff in the process was evident. Jeremy highlighted the high level of reserves in the Collaboration's accounts, and recommended that the Steering Group, in consultation with the Collaboration more broadly, should identify two or three key 'game-changers'. These would be l arge- scale ambitious projects that could help to transform the organisation for the coming twenty years, and could include (but not be restricted to) mechanisms to address key challenges such as the translation of Cochrane content , automating review production, seeding new Cochrane sites globally, tr aining, and leadership development . These projects once completed should either be self -funding or not require recurrent expenditure. There was broad support from Steering Group members for such a proposal. The Co -Chairs would prepare a paper for the next Steering Group teleconference to begin the consultation phase, with a view to decisions being made in Quebec in September 2013. Steering Group members were encouraged to involve their constituencies in the prioritisation process. Action: Jeremy and Jonathan to provide a background paper to identify several 'game-changers' for discussion at the next Steering Group meeting . Despite the substantial changes that had occurred in the Collaboration over the past few years, Jonathan explained that more change was required , especially in view of the appointment of a new CEO and his plans for restructuring the COU/CEU. Mark had joine d the Collaboration at a critical time , and an important role of the Steering Group was to provide strong and explicit support for him and his office . Jonathan recognised that change is challenging and members of the Collaboration should continue to be treated as precious , especially in a period of change. He emphasised that the main purpose s of updating the Strategic Plan and the proposed restructuring were to ensure that staff fulfil led their roles more effectively , which in turn would mean better supp ort for Collaboration members and groups. 3. Chief Executive Officer 's report Mark explained the rationale behind the structure of his written report, but in his presentation to the Steering Group he concentrated on the key elements within it. His first few months in post had been an extremely steep learning curve but he had been hugely well supported by the Co-Chairs , Editor in Chief, all members of the COU and CEU , and many other members of the Collaboration . The major foci of his work since arriving in mid-November 2012 had 3 been the completion of the publishing contract arrangements; the development of a new strategic plan framework for the Collaboration to discuss at these Oxford meetings; and the development of the Secretariat (COU, CEU, IMS and Web Teams) restructuring plans. There had been many other areas of work in addition where good progress was being made, i ncluding on the 'Global I nitiative ' (formally, the 'Building Global Capacity in Systematic Reviews' project , formerly referred to as the 'Cochrane Academy'). 3.1 Co-Chair election: The Steering Group considered the need to elect a new Co-Chair as Jonathan was due to step down at the Annual General Meeting on 21 September 2013. As agreed at the previous Steering Group meeting Mark would explore with the Charity Commission whether Co -Chairs or their institutions could be reimbursed for time spent fulfilling the Co -Chair role, to broaden the pool of suitable candidates. If approval was given, this would need to be ratified at the AGM. This timing meant that three options were possible : Jeremy to function as the single Co-Chair until a new Co-Chair was appointed ; the Co -Chair role to be advertised under the current conditions ; or Jonathan (if he were willing to remain for a few additional months, until a new Co-Chair could be appointed under the new conditions (if approved by the Charity Commission) . Following an initial discussion on 17 March the Steering Group considered the issue again at its meeting on 20 March after Jonathan had left the room. The Steering Group approved the following recommendations: (1) That the 2013 Co-Chair election be postponed until after the AGM in Quebec on 21 September 2013, when the members of the Collaboration would be asked to approve the change in the Memorandum and Articles of Association (subject to them being agreed by the UK Charity Commission) . (2) That Jonathan be asked to remain in position as Co -Chair for an additional three months beyond September 2013, so that an election could be held to replace him from January 2014. The Steering Group expressed appreciation to Jonathan for his willingness to extend his term as Co-Chair by three months to the end of December 2013. Action: Mark to request permission from the Charity Commission to remunerate Co -Chairs or their institutions, as appropriate, and if permission was given, to arrange for draft amendments to the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Collaboration to be prepared for consideration at the AGM in Quebec . 3.2 Costs of mid -year business meetings and during Colloquia: Mark explained that currently there was ambiguity about who bore the cost of these meetings, even though they were, in his view , core business meetings of the Collaboration, with a total cost of around 20- 30K GBP annually. He noted that the Steering Group had asked for a thorough evaluation of the mid-year meetings and the new entity exec utive structure , but there was a need to resolve the financial ambiguity now in order to help plan for the next Colloquium and mid-year meetings . In principle the Steering Group approved the recommendation that business meetings should be funded centrally , but this was contingent on a list being developed and approved of which 'business meeting ' costs would be covered, and would be subject to change once the evaluation had been conducted. Action: Mark to provide more detail to enable the Steering Group to reach a decision in its next teleconference. 3.3 Thomas C Chalmers Award: The Steering Group approved the recommendations of the Thomas C Chalmers Award selection panel, as detailed in Mark's report, with the request that the selection panel considers whether the rule proposed for presenters of oral presentations can also be applied to authors of poster presentations .. For oral presentations, the presenter should be assumed to be the first listed author unless clearly stated otherwise at the time of submission. Action: Mark to communicate the decision to Yemisi Takwoingi, the current Chair of the selection panel. 3.4 Secretariat restructuring : Mark re-distributed his draft proposals for the restructuring of the centrally funded staff into a single executive structure ('Secretariat' or alternative title) encompassing the COU, CEU, IMS and Web Teams , and explained in detail the reasons for and rationale behind the di stribution of executive tasks and functions and the organisational structure he was recommending. The plans received overwhelming support from the Steering Group. Some amendments, additions and clarifications were requested, though. It was pointed out that various project -oriented responsibilities such as th ose performed by the MARS group and other advisory groups had not been included in the organogram and should be shown in a more comprehensive version of the organogram of the whole Collaboration . There was wide agreement that the training portfolio would fit more appropriately within the CEU's than the Finance and Core Services department within the COU . It was noted that the restructuring would put accountabilities for production of the Handbook and those for the IMS T eam and RevMan into different reporting lines. Mark explained that many tasks, projects and initiatives would involve multiple actors across different departments and so the central executive would develop a 'matrix management' approach which meant that all staff members would report in a 'vertical' l ine management relationship to a supervisor as per the organogram; but all would be involved in some tasks requiring them to report 'horizontally' to a project manager who was responsible for ensuring that the project was successfully completed. The Steering Group also agreed to change the title of the proposed Head of 'Informatics and Business Performance ' to 'Informatics and Knowledge Management' to reflect better the main focus of the role. The Steering Group 4 recognised that the precise structure and size of some of the roles (e.g. the Human Resources Manager) was subject to change; and some central staff expressed concern that the plan was light on administrative support for the number of incoming 'Heads', and for the existing Consumer, Methods and Tr aining Co- ordinators. David warmly endorsed the plan, and welcomed a close, more integrated working in the new structure between the editorial and operational functions ( the existing CEU and COU teams). The Steering Group endorsed the proposal to make the Editor in Chief the Deputy CEO; and the new reporting and accountability line between the CEO and the Cochrane Centres , as per the relationship between the Editor in Chief and the Cochrane Review Groups and Methods Groups. The Steering Group emphasised the need to contain costs in the restructuring and to prove the value of the infrastructural investments in the medium term. It also emphasised t he Collaboration's commitment to transparent and explicit approaches to the recruitment processes for the new positions . Jeremy described the proposed restructuring as an evolutionary process, and cautioned against wordsmithing the end result at this stage. Th is was part of a wider process of change in the relationship between the executive and governance functions of the Collaboration, and there needed to be a broad review at some point of the organisation's overall governance. Mark responded to a quest ion about the location of staff members. He hoped that the recruitment process would help to generate a more international executive team, but this would depend on the candidates who applied. His preference was also that the new Heads of D epartment be located in Oxford/London, but if an exceptional candidate could not relocate then allowing him/her to work from another location would be considered. He shared with the Steering Group his calculations which indicated that the restructuring plans could be financed with an additional \u00a3150,000 per annum in addition to the \u00a3200,000 already approved by the Steering Group in Paris in 2012. This was affordable , given the continuing surplus of operational income he was projecting in the coming years. The Steering Group then approved the proposal to create a single, coherent Cochrane Collaboration central executive structure, bringing together the current COU, CEU, IMS and Web T eams. It asked Mark to propose a different name than 'Secretariat' , but approved the organisational structure as set out in paragraph 16 of his report , having made the changes that the Steering Group had suggested. In its meeting on 20 March the Steering Group approved a further amendment, with Cochrane Fields moving into a reporting and accountability relationship directly to the CEO, as with the Cochrane Centres. The Steering Group also gave Mark the go-ahead to begin implementing this plan immediately with the recruitment of three new Heads of Department, a part -time HR Manager, two Officers /Assistants and a Receptionist (net effect: 5.4 FTEs). Action: Mark to go ahead and develop the necessary job descriptions in order to begin recruitment. Communication of the above decisions was devolved to the Entity Executives to convey to their constituents by sharing Mark's background paper, focussing particularly on the different functional tasks and the new organogram. Action: Mark to update his background paper in the light of the discussion of this item before the commencement of the mid -year meetings so that it could be shared at those meetings. The Steering Group then discussed Mark's recommendation of relocating the COU to London to joint premises with the CEU in April 2015, and also approved this recommendation in principle . 4. Editor in Chief's report Deborah Dixon and Deborah Pentesco-Gilbert attended the meeting for this item and item 7. David presented his report outlining the various work programmes u ndertaken by the CEU team. Improving the quality and relevance of Cochrane Reviews, and facilitating their dissemination to key stakeholders are central to the team's work, David and his team at the CEU were acknowledged for their high level of hard work and progress. 4.1 Appendix 1 - Concerns about the quality of reviews: David asked the Steering Group to highlight how the CEU should prioritise its work, particularly in terms of concerns about maintaining the high quality of Cochrane Reviews, because the CEU was stretched to capacity. The role of the Editor in Chief and the CEU is to support Review Groups, by establishing and maintaining good practices. Proposals to centralise the sign-off of reviews for publication would require a major increase in resources, and also have huge implications for Review Groups. The work undertaken by the CEU on producing and delivering derivative products should be funded separately via Cochrane Innovations. A quality systems approach is needed throughout the Collaboration. Mechanisms for ensuring a high quality product are unequivocally the ultimate responsibility of the Editor in Chief. 4.2 Appendix 2 - Cochrane Library Oversight Committee Chair's email : This had been referred to earlier in the meeting and was not discus sed in detail . 4.3 CEU prioritisat ion (continuation of discussion on 20 March) : David reported that the concerns over review quality had been presented to the Co-ordinating Editors, who had agreed that in future the CEU would receive pre-5 publication copies of reviews, screen them and provide feedback. Approval was given in principle for the dual sign-off on reviews by editorial teams and the CEU , although issues of timing and detail would require further consultation. Action : David to prepare a document outlining the implications of pre -publication screening on the CEU's workload and any resource implications for discussion in the next Steering Group teleconference. 5. Strategic session : 5.1 Planning framework : Mark led discussion of the plans for the strategic session on 20 March, which the Steering Group had already considered briefly in its meeting on 28 February. He suggested that the existing strategic framework would only need a relatively short consultation period if the strategic session held in Oxford later that week confirmed that the strategic framework he was proposing was along the right lines . If so, then he thought that a draft Strategic Plan could be completed in time for consideration and approval at the Quebec Colloquium. If the Oxford strategic session showed that much more work and a more radical plan needed to be developed - or there was a high level of disagreement - then the strategic planning process would likely stretch into 2014. He hoped that the process of internal and external cons ultation could provide a draft Strateg y to 2020, with potential short -term objective targets which would be revised on a one- or two -year basis. The Steering Group confirmed its agreement with the proposed strategic framework that had been shared with the Collaboration ahead of the strategic session. Lucie then described to the Steering Group th e proposed format of the strategic session , and Steering Group members agreed to facilitate the five breakout discussion groups: Goal 1 (review quality): David and Julian. Goal 2 ( promotion of access): Steve and Marina. Goal 3 (external affairs): Mary Ellen, Liz, Michelle. Goal 4 (efficiency, transparency, organisational strategy): Sally, Denise, Mingming. Goal 5 (sustainability of the Collaboration): Rachel and Mona. Participants should be enco uraged to think boldly and broadly. Notes from each of the groups would be shared and used as critical inputs for the writing of a 'first draft' Strategy . Action: Steering Group members to facilitate the five breakout groups at the strategic session. 5.2 Follow -up (continuation of discussion, on 20 March) : Jonathan congratulated Lucie and Mark for their hard work in preparing the strategic session, which had gone very well. Mark reported that there was a high level of consonance in the outcomes of the work fed back by the breakout groups during the latter half of the session, and that the two challenges of 'improving the author experience' and 'focusing on the end users and their uses of Cochrane reviews ' emerged strongly from the discussions. As promised earlier, all the feedback received would be used to inform the draft Strategy to 2020 which the Steering Group would discuss in one or two teleconferences between now and Quebec as part of the wider internal and external consultation process . Action : Mark and Lucie to prepare a draft strategic paper for Steering Group discussion . Lorna to canvass Steering Group members' availability as soon as possible for two teleconferences to be held between May and July 2013. 6. Financ ial report : 6.1 Balance sheet of expenditure to date: This had been included in the agenda materials to inform items 6.2 and 6.3. 6.2 Revised budget for the COU and CEU for 2013-2014 : Mark took the Steering Group through the revised budget for 2013-14, highlighting which changes had been made to the budget originally approved in Paris in April 2012. He stressed that he had not had time to revisit each budget line; things would change further as the restructuring process took place over the rest of the year , and budgets would be updated accordingly . He was therefore seeking approval for the total budget presented (\u00a33.35 million), which although an increase from the original still projected a net transfer to reserves of over \u00a3300,000. Jonathan thanked Mark for his work in putting together this budget at such a busy time. The Steering Group approved the revised budget but it was agreed that a further revised budget would be presented to the Steering Group for 2013-14 at its meeting in Quebec in September 2013. Action: Mark to present updated figures to the Steering Group in Quebec. 6.2.1 Cost of living increases: Mark explained to the Steering Group the reasons for his recommendation that the Collaboration's centrally -funded staff receive a cost of living adjustment for 2012 linked to the inflation figure (CPI) in their respective countries ( 2.7%, 1.5% and 1.26% in the UK, Denmark and Germany respectively ). The COU and CEU staff then left the meeting . There was some concern about apparent inequity in that review group and centre staff in some jurisdictions have not had commensurate salary increases . It was agreed that a robust HR policy was needed to be put in place in due course, and that salary admi nistration would be part of this policy. After the meeting, Jonathan conveyed the Steering Group's approval of Mark's recommendation to those COU and CEU staff who were present. Action: Mark to disseminate the Steering Group's approval of his recommendati on to the centrally funded staff, and make arrangements for the implementation of the cost of living increases. 6.3 2012- 13 budget and a ctual expenditure to January 2013, and end of year forecast : Mark reminded the Steering Group that it had already briefly considered this document in its meeting on 28 February. Cochrane 6 Innovations had gift aided funds to the Charity in February , so the income figure was actually greater than indicated in the document under consideration. 7. New publishing environment Deborah Dixon and Deborah Pentesco-Gilbert attended the meeting for this item and item 4. 7.1 Publishing report on post -signing developments : Jonathan acknowledged the huge amount of hard work that had been done in the preceding twelve months, and thanked Deborah Dixon and Deborah Pentesco-Gilbert for their part in the process. He looked forward to building on the partnership between John Wiley and Sons and the Collaboration. 7.2 Cochrane -Wiley Management Team report : Lucie explained that future reports from the joint Management Team (Cochrane and Wiley) would be more comprehensive than the first one pr ovided for this meeting. It was agreed that the Entity Executives should develop a process for feeding comments to the Management Team . Strategies were needed to be developed for dissemination and marketing of The Cochrane Library to the Asian market. David focussed on the dramatic growth in the number of authors in the Pacific and Asia, and also significant increases in dissemination and usage. The Steering Group reiterated the central importance of improving t ranslated content in the Library , and that the current translations were insufficient and not readily accessible. Jonathan re - emphasised the importance of the publishers providing complete usage data, and not restricting information to the Wiley platform, but including usage through other platforms such as OVID. The Management Team had already begun looking at metrics at the review level, article level and publisher level, as well a s ways to include guidelines. Action: Deborah D and Deborah PG to provide complete access data to the Steering Group on a regular and frequent basis in future. 7.3 Wiley report : Deborah D welcomed the next stage of the new partnership with a focus o n increased dissemination of Cochrane content throughout the world, new business models (such as open access ), and increased activity in the area of derivative products . Deborah PG pointed out the importance in the new contract of technological improvements , such as the move to 'when ready' publication. The 25% increase in full text accessing of Cochrane Reviews , granting of national licences in Oman and Egypt, and healthy income growth were all very positive developments . In addition, David highlighted that the Library's iPad App was now i n its fourth monthly release, and had been well received since its launch at the end of 2012 . 8. Translation strategy proposal Xavier Bonfill attended the meeting for this item only. (The s tatus of the background paper was changed during the meeting from Restricted to Open Access .) This issue was considered hand in hand with agenda item 11.1 (Strategies for supporting and strengthening non - English-language speakers' participation) . (See also item 11.2.3.) Xavier Bonfill, Director of the Iberoamerican Cochrane Centre, attended the meeting for this item only, and presented the report of the Translation Working Group . He stressed that the Collaboration could do much more in ensuring that Cochrane content was translat ed, and focussed on several identified strategies to provide Cochrane products in more languages . He recommended that the English language text of Cochrane Reviews be more standardised, more translation-friendly and better structured, which would increase the understanding and participation of non-English - speaking contributors in the Collaboration's work. The report recommended moving to machine translation with human validation, and described various successful initiatives in this area in France and South America. Xavier referred to the tremendous potential of the ' Linked Data ' project to facilitate greater translations , and he also proposed translations on a multilingual platform, expecting that the new publishing agreement with John Wiley and Sons would facilitate this. He argued that there had been insufficient investment in the Biblioteca Cochran e Plus compared to The Cochrane Library , and spoke of the marketing opportunities which had not yet been fully explored. He said that the translation issue was not restricted to the need to translate Cochrane Reviews, but extended to podcasts, the Cochrane Policy Manual, the Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and to other training materials. He suggested that t he six WHO languages should be the first ones to which the Collaboration's product s and materials should be translated, and that the exploration of different translation models should be centrally funded. Jeremy thanked Xavier and his colleagues for their excellent background paper . Xavier responded to several requests for clarification. He explained that the success of automatic translation depended on the use of simple language, and that there were several available strategies that should be explored. It was suggested that Cochrane Reviews were scientific documents and it was therefore difficult to see how someone checking their translation would have all the necessary skills (i.e. in statistics, methodology, economics, etc.) to do so. Xavier reiterated the importance of having several different but mutuall y supporting methods of translation in order to overcome this . David suggested exploring the preparation of reviews in one's own language and then being translated after submission for publication ; and that the Collaboration should expand its translation of Plain Language Summaries into multiple languages. Mark stressed that the value of 'crowd-sourcing' as a method of efficiently and effectively translating content was greater than the paper implied. Xavier welcomed these comments and looked forward to the strategy being developed into a plan of action. The Steering Group recognised the importance of translation and improving linguistic accessibi lity to the 7 Collaboration's products and in its work processes. It decided that the central executive team and the Translation Working Group should start to develop an action plan incorporating research and development, and operational and business issues . The Steering Group requested that a draft be prepared in time for discussion in Quebec. Xavier and Mark were asked to work together on this, together with the Translation Working Group, and report back on a planned process for the next Steering Group teleconference. Action: Mark to work with Xavier and the T raining Working Group on the production of a comprehensive business plan and translation strategy 9. Commercial sponsorship of Cochrane R eviews and entities (discussed on 20 March) The draft commercial sponsorship policy had been circulated to the Steering Group in advance but had not been made available for discussion during the Entity Executives' meetings on 18 and 19 March. Although the Funding Arbitration Panel had been unanimous in its support of the draft policy, discussions held during the Co-ordinating Editors' and Managing Editors' meeti ngs had raised procedural concerns. In particular, the Co-ordinating Editors had unanimously disagreed with clause a.3 of the paper regarding authors being unable to conduct reviews if they had received funding in the previous three years from either commercial sponsors or sources with a vested interest in the findings of the reviews (e.g. clinical usage) . The MEs believed that clause c.14, stating that , \"Cochrane authors who include primary studies (which they had conducted) in their review should declare this in the Declarations of Interest section\", might not always happen, but every effort should be made to ensure that such a declaration is made. It was agreed that a ll Steering Group members needed to consult fully with their constituents about the draft policy before the Steering Group could sign off on it, as it was still in the development stage and needed redrafting to address some major concerns that had been expressed. Once all the relevant entities had discussed the redrafted policy it was agr eed that Steering Group members should collate and send their responses to Mark , who would be responsible (supported by David) for developing this document further with a view to sign- off at the second of the Steering Group's two meetings in Quebec on 24 S eptember 2013. ACTION: Jonathan to thank Sophie Hill for producing the commercial sponsorship paper and for her enormous contribution to the Collaboration as the outgoing Funding Arbiter . Steering Group members to consult their constituents over the draft commercial sponsorship policy and send feedback to Mark by the end of April who would incorporate suggestions with a view to a decision being made in Quebec. 10. Trading Companies : 10.1 Collaboration Trading Company: There were no issues in the report on this trading company which needed discussion or decision. 10.2 Cochrane Innovations: In his report on behalf of his co -directors of Cochrane Innovations , Lorne Becker recommended appoint ing Denise Thomson and Mark Wilson as additional directors. Previously, concerns had been raised over a potential conflict of interest regarding directors being entitled to receive income from the Trading Company . However, Mark explained that this could easily be sorted out by including a provision in either Cochrane Innovation's Articles of Association or its Memorandum of Understanding with the charity establishing that the Collaboration's CEO be excluded from any remuneration. The Steering Group approved that Mark be accepted as a new Director of Cochrane Innovations , and asked Denise to send her CV to Mark for circulation to the Steering Group before final approval of her directorship. The Steering Group also approved Lorne's recommendation for Cochrane Innovations to reimburse the Collaboration for half a day per week of Mark's time over the next six months (April to September 2013) . He explained that the plan was for a part -time Cochrane Innovations CEO to be appointed soon after wards who would have the time, experience and skill s set to guide the business in future . Action : Denise to send her CV to Mark for the Steering Group's consideration, with a view to her appointment as a Director of Cochrane Innovations. Mark to arrange for Cochrane Innovation's Articles of Association to be amended, to include the stipulation that the CEO be excluded from receiving remuneration in his role as Director. Mark to invoice Cochrane Innovations for half a day per week of his time from April to September 2013. 11. Entity Executives : 11.1 Strategies for supporting and strengthening n on-English-language speakers' participation : The paper from the Consumers ' Executive was considered along with agenda item 8 (Translation strategy proposal ). Liz spoke briefly on the background document. Mingming recommended that a non-English -speaking consumer from the Cochrane Consumer Network (CCNet) should join the Translation Working Group. This was agreed. Action: Mark and Xavier to ensure a non -English- speaking consumer from the Cochrane Consumer Network joins the Translation Working Group . 11.2 Entity Executives' r eports : Due to time constraints, the relevant Steering Group members summarised the key points that had been discussed during the Entity Executives' meetings on 18 and 19 March, as follows: 11.2.1 Consumers' Executive: Mingming reported that the Consumers ' Executive had discussed and agreed next steps on training for consumers as a priority for increasing their number in CRGs ; transparency in terms of funding for the Cochrane Consumer Network ( CCNet ), both external and internal; the need for transparency r egarding the 8 Consumer Co- ordinator 's role and accountability to the CEO, and how this related to CCNet; the current election process to the Consumers' Executive, and ways of encouraging consumer nominations for both the Steering Group and the Consumers' Executive; building more partnership s with consumers' groups , and improved ways of involving non-English -speaking consumers. 11.2.2 Managing Editors' Executive: Sally reported that the MEs had discussed the proposed ME portal, the very positive start to the ME Support programme, the quality of reviews, data extraction software, and the increasing importance of technology. 11.2.3 Centre Directors' Executive: Steve explained that the main focus of the Centre Directors' meetings had been on the relationship between the CEO and the Centre Directors, and the proposal that the CEO should co- convene Centre Directors' meetings. Mark had left the room whilst the Centr e Directors had discussed this. Some Directors had expressed concerns over a lack of control they thought might occur as a result of the proposed relationship, but the Centre Directors came to agreement that the CEO and the Centre Director's representative on the Steering Group should co-chair these meetings, with the CEO becoming an ex officio member of the Centre Directors' Executive. Two other topics covered in the meetings were Xavier Bonfill's translation strategy proposal, for which there was strong support (see item 8 above) ; and the role of Centres in Cochrane globalisation and how they would represent and support countries in their respective regions. 11.2.4 Methods Executive: Julian reported on the discussions that had taken place arising from a position paper from the Comparing Multiple Interventions Methods Group about the use of network meta- analysis (which compares multiple interventions for a particular condition). Because widespread use of net work meta- analysis would lead to overlap of treatments included across reviews, the current suggestion is to consider a new review type for questions about ranking of multiple interventions. An alternative option preferred by some is to collate study data in a central repository and allow reviews to have overlapping scopes, drawing from this single source of study data. Also discussed was the need for a central initiative across Methods Groups in terms of updating, establishing an EU funding application for methods work, and strong support for establishing a Translation Methods Group. 11.2.5 Trials Search Co -ordinators' Executive : Michelle reported that the TSCs' Executive had spent the entire meeting time in Paris in April 2012 writing and managing a response to the proposal for a centrally funded Information Specialist. Since that meeting, the y had focussed on planning two reports, one on information management and retrieval within the Collaboration, the other a background paper on Specialised Registers , past, present and future. Issues of interest included governance and conflict of interest issues within Executives and working groups/committees. 11.2.6 Fields' Executive: Denise explained that discussions had focussed on mentoring and support for Fields with the aim of producing a work plan for Quebec ; potential 'game changing' investment s; and pushing evidence out into electronic records. The Fields' Executive had discussed and proposed that the Fields report to the CEO , and the Steering Group approved this recommendation (see item 3.4 above) . Action: Mark to amend the organogram to reflect that the CEO is now responsible for Fields. 11.2.7 Co-ordinating Editors' Executive: Rachel reported that the Co-ordinating Editors had discussed the draft commercial sponsorship policy in depth (see item 9 above); pre-publication sign- off of reviews to ensure high quality content (see item 4 above); and potential 'game changing' investments. Rachel and Jonathan also reported that the Co-ordinating Editors' Board had agreed that a wide-ranging review of the structure and function of C ochrane Review Groups (CRGs) was required. A scoping paper needed to be developed, highlighting how the existing CRG structure had been formed initially , the inherent challenges, and the process of consultation that needed to be followed. Action: Jonathan to work with the C o-Chairs, the Editor in Chief and the CRG rep resentative s to develop a scoping document to reconsider the structure and function of CRGs. 12. Quebec Colloquium Mary Ellen reported that planning for the Quebec Colloquium was going well. The Colloquium website (http://colloquium.cochrane.org ) had been live for some time and was expanding daily; all its content was available in both French and English. Emails promoting the Colloquium were being sent out monthly, with reminder announcements about deadlines. Thirty -four workshop proposals had al ready been accepted. The deadline for abstract submissions was 4 April. The plenary sessions were close to being finalised, and all the individuals approached regarding special topics had confirmed their willingness to contribute. Sponsorship was going wel l, and registration for the Colloquium would be possible from 25 March. 13. 20th Anniversary celebrations Jeremy reported that the 20th Anniversary celebration s activities were progressing well , and thanked Jini for her input as Anniversary Co -ordinator. Statistics on viewing figures for the first A nniversary video had been extremely encouraging, at over 3, 000 views already, and the sixth anniversary video had just been released. The video captions could now be translated via ' Google Translat e'. The author who had been commissioned to produce recollections of the Collaboration from the interviews filmed in Madrid, Oxford and Paris was progressing the project. Investigations were ongoing into reprinting Archie Cochrane's publication, 'Effective ness and Efficiency'. Jeremy reminded the Steering Group that the Anniversary website ( http://anniversary.cochrane.org) had been live for some time and already included over 4, 000 photographs taken during Cochrane meetings, and an archive of memorabilia. 9 14. Matters arising from draft minutes of previous meeting, not appearing elsewhere on this agenda There were no additional items for discussion arising from the draft minutes of the Steering Group t eleconference on 28 February 2013, nor correct ions requested at the meeting. These minutes were therefore de facto approved and should be made publicly available. Action: Lorna to circulate the minutes to all entities, archive them in Archie, and make them available on cochrane.org. 15. Any other business : 15.1 Funding Arbiter: Jonathan reported that this position was still vacant and, due to Steering Group members' heavy workloads appearing to prevent any one expressing interest in taking on this role, consideration should be given to opening this vacancy to non-Steering Group members . This possibility would be explored outside the meeting. Action: Jonathan, Jeremy and Mark to discuss how to identify a new Funding Arbiter. 15.2 Expressions of appreciation: Jonathan expressed thanks to Steering Group members for their responsiveness , support and hard work; also to Lucie and Mark for their substantial contributions towards the mid- year meetings, and to Jini and Lorna for taking the minutes. 10 APPENDIX Declarations of interest of Steering Group members, and staff of the Cochrane Editorial Unit and the Cochrane Operations Unit [Declarations updated on 07 March 2013] The Cochrane Collaboration Steering Group (CCSG) is the governing body of The Cochrane Collaboration, and the board of directors of the registered charity. Its members are elected by the overall membership of The Cochrane Collaboration for three years, wit h annual rotation of a proportion of its members. A conflict of interest exists when a secondary interest (e.g. personal financial gain) can influence, or have the appearance of influencing, judgements regarding the primary interest (e.g. service on the CCSG). CCSG members are asked to disclose all relationships with commercial organisations that could pose a conflict of interes t that would reasonably appear to be related to the primary interest. The term 'related organisation' in the questions below means any organisation related to health care or medical research. These declarations of interest are updated regularly. Managing conflicts of interest is the responsibility of the entire CCSG, under the guidance of the Co- Chairs. All CCSG members are expected to disclose potential conflicts, and any CCSG member may raise a concern about a conflict of interest. A. Financial interests In the past five years, have you: 1.

OPEN ACCESS Chief Executive Officer 's report to the CCSG Prepared by: Mark Wilson Date: 7th March 2013 Purpose: To provide the Steering Group (CCSG) with a report on recent developments in relation to the key strategic objectives it set for the year 2012 -13, an update on other work by the CEO and the central support staff, and t o seek the CCSG's approval for the recommendations recorded below. Urgency: Low Access: Open Background: This is my first written report on activities to the CCSG since my arrival and I would welcome feedback to ensure it is meeting your reporting needs. Report: Introduction I joined the Collaboration as the new CEO on Monday 12 th November 2012, so have been in post for only three -and-a-half months. It has been an intense period o f activity from that first day - when I was asked to lead the Collaboration's team working on the future publishing arrangements (FPAP) - and this provided the main focus of m y work until the end of January when a new publishing cont ract with John Wiley & Sons was signed in Oxford. Since then I have been focused on two other large and very important new initiatives: the development of a new strategic plan for the Collaboration; and planning for the reorganization of the Collaboration' s central structures into an integrated Secretariat. In addition, I have also begun a rapid journey of discovery about the Collaboration in all of its complexity and diversity , visiting the US, Nordic, German and UK Cochrane Centres and six Review Groups in the UK; joining a meeting of the six continental European Cochrane Centres in Copenhagen in January; and speaking with many other Collaborators around the world. I am very grateful for the great patience and understanding extended to me by everyone I have met as I began to learn about their work , their achievements and the challenges they are grappling with . Inevitably there were many issues awaiting the arrival of the new CEO but I have been wonderfully supported and guided in my f irst months in the job by the staff of the COU, CEU, IMS and Web Development teams - and particularly Cochrane's Editor in Chief, David Tovey. Whilst I have been settling into post, great progress has been made since the Auckland Colloquium across the Co llaboration, and this report will also attempt to reflect and report on some of the highlights of this work - particularly in relation to the Steering Group's strategic objectives for the year 2012- 13. New Publishing Contract The new publishing contract with Wiley is, I think , an extremely goo d one for the Collaboration. As I said in the announcement at the time of the signing, the new contract marks a significant advance in establishing funded, free, and open access to Cochrane systematic reviews; provides major investment in technology and new product development to keep us at the cutting edge of innovation in healthcare information; and also supports our organizational ambitions to promote evidence -based health care across the globe. In the last few days we have agreed with Wiley the remaining details relating to the OPEN ACCESS open access provisions (the so- called 'gold road' and 'green road' terms) whi change in the accessibility of Cochrane systematic reviews, whilst also offering a robust model which should deliver the revenues the organization needs in the coming years to maintain its independence , expand its work and do more to achieve its mission. The move to open access in the research, scientific and publishing worlds is, in my view, a trend that will gather even greater momentum in the coming years. It is a phenomenon completely in line with the values and mission of the Collaborat ion and therefore it is important that we respond effectively to the challenges that it brings; but open access moves the cost of publishing from readers and users of information to the producers of content - and as a producer of some of the most intellectually rigorous, expensive but highest qual ity information content in the world this is a major challenge for the Collaboration in the coming decade. The new publishing agreement to the end of 2018 gives us what we believe is an excellent and sustainable base, as well as valuable time in which to develop other diversified sources of income beyond our existing licensing revenues. The development of new technological vehicles and tools to support the more efficient production of systematic reviews and the dissemination and use of our products is going to be fundamental to this transition. As essentially an information organization we need to ensure we are at the cutting edge technologically , and we will need both to invest in our own capacities in this area and ensure that Wiley help us deliver fantast ic experiences for the users of Cochrane material - and also for the authors who produce it. The contract also gives us the flexibility to re -assess the external environment and the model we have and will continue to develop with Wiley - particularly in relation to the open access offerings we are making - which will ensure we can adapt to chan ging circumstances in the coming years. Strategic Planning Ensuring that the Collaboration will have a new strategic plan in 2013 to guide its journey through the next five to seven years (to 2020) has been the next area of concentration since the publishing agreement was signed in late January. In the separate paper which was submitted to the Steering Group in late February and has now been made available for a ll the Collaboration a head of the mid- year meetings, I reviewed the Collaboration's existing strategic framework as it has developed over the last decade and made some initial recommendations which I hope will serve as a useful starting point for the strat egic planning session in Oxford. My conclusion is that the Collaboration has a reasonable strategic framework in place, but that it needs to be updated and refreshed, with two critically important areas of change to take place: 1. Focusing externally I think the Collaboration needs to look again at its mission in terms of defining its place in the world and its ambitions over the next decade in order to do more to bring about its vision that 'healthcare decision -making throughout the world will be inform ed by high -quality, timely research evidence'. What would that mean? My vision for the Collaboration is more than that set out in the present Mission statement. I want 'Cochrane' to become the 'go to' organisation for everything to do with healthcare systematic reviews: when anybody anywhere thinks about systematic reviews in the field of healthcare, they think ' Cochrane'. I think the Collaboration should set itself the goal of becoming a global leader in the promotion of evidence -based healthcare, much mor e influential in health policymaking, and much more focused on the users and the uses of our products rather than solely the production of systematic reviews. This means that our strategy needs to address much more comprehensively the Collaboration's external place and profile in the world; on our content not only in terms of its quality (which must remain the basis of all of our actions) but its application. What are our specific ambitions to reach new and more audiences, and to influence policy -maker s? How can we focus more on the external impact of our organisation and our products and less on the mechanics of the ir production? How can we respond better to the priorities of others in what, when and why we produce reviews; and how we respond to a revolution in information technology to ensure that our information is seen and used over OPEN ACCESS that produced by others? How and what are the best partnerships to ensure that we build on our strengths, cover our weaknesses and attain wider, deeper global reach? 2. Becoming more supportive and efficient internally I think the Collaboration need s to become more coherent and efficient in its internal organisation and ways of working: not to dampen the creativity, innovation and dynamism that are the unique character istics and strengths of the Collaboration but to make them more powerful. Improving our governance, strengthening our management structures, supporting our overworked volunteers and engaging them more effectively will enable us to meet the external challen ges in the healthcare and information management sectors that we face. We need to change the author experience as well as the user experience for the better: to try to make the authoring process less intimidating and drawn out; to shorten the production ti mes, and learn from best practice within the Collaboration's Review Groups and other entities in providing more consistent support to authors. I look forward to the Collaboration's members and governance structures shaping a new strategic plan, with the d iscussions in Oxford setting the roadmap for how this process will develop in the rest of 2013. Secretariat R eorgani zation The third major focus of my first three months in post has been to draw up a plan for an expanded Secretariat (bringing together the COU, CEU, IMS and Web Development teams) which can better support Collaboration entities and members; and help to deliver its future development objectives as set out in the new strategic plan. This plan builds on the analysis and de cisions already taken by the Steering Group in 2012 that identified areas in which greater capacity needed to be developed by the Collaboration's central support structures. These included in marketing and communications, in finance, human resources and re venue generation. My goal in the new plan is to create a single, coherent Cochrane Collaboration Secretariat structure with clear lines of executive accountability and responsibility; which has an integrated and cohesive team spirit and affiliation; with a responsive approach to supporting individual entity members of the Collaboration and its governance bodies; with a much more external focus on the Collaboration's place in the world in fulfilment of its mission; and with a determination to be dynamic, effective and efficient in the delivery of its ob jectives. My starting point - and the principal management approach underlying all that I am proposing - is to ensure that there is a clear distinction between the strategic, policy and advisory responsibilities of the Steering Group and its various sub- committees; and the executive delivery functions of the central Secretariat which is responsible for 'doing' - or co -ordinating and facilitating the 'doing' with Collaboration volunteers, entities and other internal and external stakeholders. As the CEO, I am responsible for the effective and efficient delivery of the targets and objectives that the Steering Group sets. There appear to have grown up many grey areas of responsibility and muddied accountabilities between members or parts of the Collaboration; and I believe that these must be resolved and clear accountabilities applied in order for the organisation to work much more effectively, transparently and accountably. So one of the central tenets of my reorganisation plans is to make it very clear who w ill be responsible for what in the new Secretariat, so that members, and managers, know whom to engage with on every topic. This makes interaction and engagement with the Secretariat more straightforward, and will highlight high and below standard performa nce as individuals focus on given areas of work for which they are accountable - for finance, marketing and communications, strategy and planning, Colloquia and membership support, etc. This will also allow the Collaboration's Steering Group to concentrate on the strategy and policy guidance which should be its main focus; and to hold myself and the central Secretariat to account for the delivery of the organization's objectives. 2012- 13 Strategic Objectives OPEN ACCESS In April 2012 the Steering Group set out the most important strategic objectives the Collaboration should aim to achieve over the following twelve months. These should serve as the main foci of the central Secretariat's priorities and the reporting of its successes and setbacks. The following table therefore assesses what we judge to be the final performance for the year for each of these objectives (with a simple traffic light designation of green for achieved, amber for partly achieved and red for not achieved) as well as brief narratives reporting mainly on progress over the last six months since the Auckland Colloquium. 2012 -13 Strategic Objective 2012 -13 Achievement 1. We will continue to prioritise our support for the Editor in Chief and the CEU as they seek to improve the quality, relevance, usability, and impact of The Cochrane Library. \u00fc Quality Management Initiatives: The Collaboration's single most important strategic goal is - and must continue to be - maintaining and expanding the quality of its systematic reviews. David Tovey and the CEU team delivered important progress towards this goal over the last twelve months, with highlights since Auckland being : The MECIR project continues on track. The conduct and reporting standards are in place and we are well advanced in ensuring that the ERC checklists, online training materials and Handbook reflect the standards. The CEU is drafting the next stage of the MECIR implementation plan and we are also planning the work on revising the stand ards to accommodate updating reviews. The MECIR standards, including the new standards for PLS, will be printed for the Collaboration as a booklet of recommendations which can accompany the Cochrane Handbook. Publishing and Editorial Policy Manual: The CEU is proposing to separate out the publishing related el ements of the current Cochrane M anual and develop this as a standalone item. Whilst the initial content will be sourced from the existing M anual it will help us to identify and fill gaps in the coverage. The CEU has appointed an intern, No\u00e9mie Aubert Bonn, to support Harriet MacLehose in developing this work. Impact I nitiatives: The Collaboration's content management programme outlines a range of projects aimed at improving the impact of Cochr ane Reviews : The Cochrane Library iPad version is now live and three issues have been published. This format will be further developed and will ensure that the technology provider also develops formats for other Smartphones. The CEU team is developing an amended process to review all published reviews to consider different dissemination tracks, including: press and media release, podcasts, iPad, Journal Club, social media and the featured review on the Collaboration site . Derivatives: Work continues on Cochrane Clinical Answers and Dr Cochrane. We are now close to the milestone of 100 signed- off CCAs. Translations : The w ork of the translation exchange continues, and as the most recent report from this group shows there is goo d progress with respect to French and Chinese translations. The Web Team has been working with the Translation Working Group and IMS to gather and publish translations of abstracts and PLSs of Cochrane Reviews on summaries.cochrane.org including translation of the interface and navigation in French, Spanish and Simplified Chinese. The re are now 100 translations in Simplified Chinese, over 2,500 in French, and more than 4,500 in Spanish. The Iberoa merican Centre has resumed its translation project and publication via Update Software, and we are now retrieving the new translations on a monthly basis. Xavier Bonfill , Director of the Centre, also took on leadership of a new Translation Working G roup looking at how to expand rapidly the translations of Cochrane content , and the group has drafted a p roposed translation strategy for the Collaboration which is being considered during the mid- year meetings. Online development: During the contract discussions Wiley ceased working on certain projects. However, the search project continued and phase 2 has now been released successfully. Another initiative that has continued is the \"publish when ready\" project. We remain on course for a June 2013 release of this function. Now that the contract has been signed we will be pushing hard for progress in relation to the other presentation and delivery OPEN ACCESS projects. Links with guidelines: The CEU is liaising with Ann e Eisinga at the UKCC, who has been working to identify guidelines associated with individual systematic reviews. We believe that this work, due to be completed in March 2013, could be enormously valuable in helping to identify such links. 2. We will appoint a new CEO to provide leadership, vision and high -level management across the Collaboration. \u00fc This objective was - of course - achieved. 3. We will expand the COU to enable it to provide better support for Cochrane groups and individuals worldwide as they seek to implement the vision and mission of the Collaboration. - This objective is in the process of being implemented, with a plan for an expansion and reorganization of the Collaboration's 'Secretariat' to be decided on by the CCSG at the mid- year meetings in March 2013 (see above). 4. We will sign off on a new publishing contract for The Cochrane Library which will enhance the use and impa ct of the Library worldwide, and ensure we can continue to provide core infrastructural support to the Collaboration. \u00fc A new publishing contract with John Wiley & Sons was agreed and signed in January 2013 (see above). 5. We will celebrate our 21st year, and tell the world our story. - The Working Groups established to help Cochrane celebrate its 20th anniversary have continued to implement their plans . The first five videos produced as part of a series intended to be released throughout 2013 have been issued to a very strong reception , published on YouTube and on the Collaboration's special A nniversary website: http://anniversary.cochrane.org/home with subtitles in several languages being added. The photo archive now has more than 4200 photos ( http://anniversary.cochrane.org/photo- archive ) and t he 20th Anniversary publications and meetings database is live and accepting submissions Discussions are continuing on how best to use the draft text written by Alan Cassels, based on 100 interviews of Cochrane contributors ; and Jackie Chandler, Methods Co - ordinator, is working with Methods Groups to produce articles for a special issue to be published in the BMC 's 'Systemat ic Reviews' journal. Meanwhile, t he CEU has held meetings with representatives from the BMJ and PLoS who have expressed interest in publishing material to celebrate the anniversary . In addition, we are planning to publish a series of editorials within The Cochrane Library to highlight landmark reviews and the people behind them, plus other noteworthy issues such as methods development, use of technology , etc. PR plans are being drawn up, particularly around the Quebec Colloquium, and the Working groups are also liaising with Cochrane Centres in South Africa and Australia on publicity materials to highlight the anniversary at their events in 2013, with more events to be included. 6. We will enhance our monitoring and management functions, particularly of individuals, groups and platforms which receive core Collaboration funding and/or use the Cochrane brand, primarily through the Editorial and Operations Units, working with relevant executives ( carried over). - The CEU /COU develop ed revised, provisional core functions for CRGs and a new monitoring form for the 2013 round, which was issued in February 2013. The form differ s from its predecessor in several ways, but should provide very useful information for CRGs to monitor t heir own performance and also to identify outliers, ways in which the CRGs can be better supported, and - for the first time - invite feedback on the performance of the central units in providing this support. A new financial monitoring form was also devel oped and issued in late February which will give the Collaboration much more accurate and consolidated financial data which will be vital for management and fundraising purposes. OPEN ACCESS 7. We will seek to develop alternative funding sources (carried over) . - Progress has been slow on this objective but Cochrane Innovations has been successful in attracting funds for its first two commissioned rapid reviews. Discussions are advanced with the US funding organization GiveWell , and a decision by them is expected l ater in the year. The development of alternative funding sources will remain a critically important objective for the Collaboration for the coming years. 8. We will form an external advisory board , and enhance our partnerships with external stakeholders of the Collaboration and The Cochrane Library, such as health information providers, policy -makers and funders (carried over). \u00fb Work was not started by the CCSG in 2012 -13 on establishing an external advisory board, and partnership development with other relevant organizations is not well developed. A wide -ranging governance review is planned by the CCSG in 2013- 14 and it is anticipated that governance reform will follow. The Secretariat restructuring will also expand the Collaboration's external part nership capacity through the appointment of a Head of External Affairs working with the CEO. 9. We will enhance global participation and relevance of The Cochrane Collaboration and The Cochrane Library through the formation of the 'Cochrane Academy' (carried over). - The Cochrane Academy had a name change to the Cochrane Initiative to build Global Capacity in Systematic Reviews. Contracts have been or are just about to be issued with the four organizations in Chile, India, Pakistan and South Africa , selected for the first phase of capacity building. Talks have also begun with The Alliance for Health Systems and Policy Research , EPPI -Center and the Campbell Collaboration to establish a 'Global Network for Evidence Synthesis '. A mapping funded by the Global Health Research initiative (part of Canada's IDRC) of current global evidence synthesis capacity will be carried out over the next five months with t he intention of bring ing together in terested organizations and funders at an 'Evidence Summit' alongside the Collaboration's Quebec Colloquium in September 2013. 10. We will improve the dissemination and uptake of our reviews , and enhance our brand, through the implementation of a coherent marketing and communication strategy (carried over) . \u00fb Work was begun on the development of a marketing and communications strategy in 2012 but this was suspended pending the arrival of the new CEO. This remains a critical area of improvement needed by the Collaboration and the proposed Se cretariat reorganization plan includes a new department specifically focused on external relations, advocacy, marketing and communications with a new Head of Communications & External Affairs (subject to approval) who will lead the development of a new strategy covering them. It is therefore recommended that this objective be carried over into 2013- 14 with substantial progress expected within the next 12 months. 11. We will begin to develop a more author - and user -friendly and efficient approach to the organisation of topics within The Cochrane Library (carried over) . \u00fc There are a number of technology dependent projects aimed at addressing these aims that we expect to start to deliver with in 2013. Th e CEU is working with CRGs and F ields to improve the utility and function of the homepage browse . The new search project and proposals for translations represent steps forward in delivering an improved user -friendly interface. 12. We will develop a new five -year strategic plan . - An initial analysis was conducted and recommendations made to the CCSG (see separate strategy paper); and the strategy session at the mid -year meeting in Oxford in March 2013 will begin the formal strategic planning exercise which will run through 2013. We will promote generational change within the organisation, particularly within the leadership, ensuring better global and gender equity . \u00fb Systematic work has not begun on promoting generational change within the Collaboration and it is recommended OPEN ACCESS that this be carried over into the CCSG work plan in 2013 -14. Other Issues Cochrane Register of Studies ( CRS) The pace of imp lementation of the CRS increased considerably in recent months in order to ensure that all CRGs migrated their specialized registers into the CRS by the deadline of 31st March 2013. Concerns were raised by Meerkat users relating to synchronization of their registers, but the Metaxis team worked closely with the groups in question and we are hopeful that they will all be able to meet the 1st April 2013 deadline for synchronisation. Only eight groups are believed to be at high risk of missing the deadline after the substantial efforts made by Ruth Foxlee from the CEU, three TSC support people (Doug Salzwedel, A nna Noel -Storr , Anne Littlewood and Fergus Tai) and Metaxis. It will be vitally important that these groups manage the migration soon after the deadline, as t he CRS is a fundamental element of the Collaboration's technology infrastructure with enormous pot ential to improve the quality and dynamism of the data on which Cochrane Reviews are based. It will also greatly enhance the user experience and efficiency of maintaining a Specialised Register in future. Cochrane Websites and Social Media The six months since the Auckland Colloquium were a busy but productive time for the Web Team. In addition to maintenance activities, there have been new developments in a number of areas. Highlights include the following (with more details in Annex 1) : \u00b7 Moving the summaries.cochrane.org site from beta to live; \u00b7 Ongoing development of Event/Colloquium Manager ; \u00b7 Installing m ajor new features, functionality and content on the 20 th Anniversary website (anniversary.cochrane.org) ; \u00b7 New features and websites in the Entity Web site Builder system ; \u00b7 There are now a total of 136 websites under the Web Team's umbrella which are either live or in active development ; \u00b7 There have been 11 new homepage features in the last six months, and 25 in the last 12 months (a significant increase compared to 16 in the previous 12- month timeframe ); \u00b7 The first version of the impact stories database is in beta testing (http://www.cochrane.org/impact -stories ). This project is a Web Team/CEU -led effort to create a resource available to all Cochrane contributors that catalogs the impact of Cochrane evidence; \u00b7 There are now more than 2,000 Cochrane contributors using the Community area of Cochrane.org; \u00b7 The TSC Portal, the first role -based portal, went live in September and now functions as the main resource for TSCs as well as for information on the CRS (http://www.cochrane.org/community/tsc -portal ). The ME Portal is still in development in conjunction with the Entity Execs. \u00b7 A recent e- privacy directive from the EU requires websites to inform visitors of how cookies are used on their websites. We therefore added a message to all websites informing visitors of the cookies we use and updated th e disclaimer page on Cochrane.org . \u00b7 Combined numbers of followers, members, \"friends\", etc. across social media networks now exceed 22,000; aver aging 200 new Twitter followers a week. The combined number has nearly doubled in the past 12 months from 11,000 this time last year. IMS team Archie 3.10 & 3.11 were released in December 2012 and February 2013 respectively. For more information on 3.10 & 3.11 please see the full list: http://ims.cochrane.org/archie/new -releases/whats- new. The IMS team has invested some time in improving the current Archie interface so that it is more mobile friendly , and is keen to hear from Collaboration members as to their interest in pursuing this pr oject , including wish -list items or projects that they think mobile technology could help to address. OPEN ACCESS At the end of January 2013, there were more than 15,500 users of Archie (an increase of approximately 4000 users over a one -year period). The database s tores nearly 39,000 person records, of which more than 20,500 are active authors. There are 12,448 individual review records covering more than 450,000 versions. There are more than 14,500 running workflows. For more facts about Archie, updated quarterly, visit http://ims.cochrane.org/archie/facts- on-archie . RevMan 5.2 was released to DTA authors only in September 2012 and on 29 November 2012 it was made available to all authors, with some further bug fixes made in January 2013. The changes to this version primarily affected Diagnostic Test Accuracy (DTA) reviews, and therefore it is not compulsory to upgrade RevMan for authors preparing non-DTA reviews. The full list of new functions is available on the following link: http://ims.cochrane.org/revman/new -releases/whats- new- in-revman -5. Meanwhile, 6 'wish -list' continues . The team's ambition is to make RevMan as efficient as possible for authors, to plan for flexibility in review methods and quality assurance tools, but also to keep the update fairly lean so that the IMS team can start exploring the possibility of moving RevMan online in the fu ture (with offline functionality enabled to support limited internet access). RevMan 6 is scheduled to be released in late 2014. To support use of IMS systems, a new process has been established . All Managing Editors now have an ME Support person to conta ct in the first instance with any query concerning the ME use of IMS systems. MEs are also encouraged to contact the IMS via our suggestion form on the IMS website if the issue is more technical. To support other users the IMS team appointed Karen Hovhannisyan in October 2012 to manage email querie s concerning Archie and RevMan use. Fo r more details on all these points see Annex 2. Cochrane Linked Data Project In early December 2012 an important and successful three- day meeting was held in London which established a Linked Data Project Board to scope, plan and provide a business case a nd expected resource implications for moving this project forward. Chris Mavergames and Jessica Thomas are co - chairing the Project Board and the aim is to finish a specific set of proposals and recommendations to go to the CEO and the Steering Group by mid -April 2013. More information on the project can be found here: http://www.cochrane.org/community/development -projects/cochrane- linked -data-project PLEACS The PLEACS group concluded a year -long Delphi decision- making process which involved a dedicated group of consumers, methodologists, MEs, Co -ordinating Editors, Managing Editors and representatives from the Cochrane Editorial Unit. Through a collaborative process with Cochrane Review stakeholders, mandatory standards for plain language summaries were finalized in February 2013. The standards for PLS will be implemented alongside the MECIR standards according to a schedule that will be presented at the mid-year m eeting. The next portion of the PLEACS project will see the larger working group divided into two smaller groups with different purposes. To aid implementation of the standard, the first group will focus on format recommendations (i.e. the look and feel of the PLS), while the second group will design tools and guidance materials for authors and Managing Editors to utilize the standards. An update on the progress of these two groups will follow in the next report. Cochrane Summaries A new website, now live for the public, presents consumers with an innovative way to find the information they need in Cochrane reviews (see http://summaries.cochrane.org ). For the first time, all plain language summaries and a bstracts on Cochrane Summaries have the resource of a built -in glossary that automatically highlights and defines technical terms and jargon as you read. In addition, search terms are mapped to a drug name database which provides consumers with the generic and brand names for the drug term for which they are searching. Any drug or disease, regardless of any misspelling, will instantly redirect the user to the relevant Cochrane Review. Current features of summaries include : \u00b7 Search disambiguation by drug bra nd name now live using data from Drugbank.ca. OPEN ACCESS \u00b7 \"Did you mean?\" search assistance for proximity -matching \u00b7 Search in French, German or Spanish (Chinese coming soon) with almost no English along the way - the interface is translated \u00b7 Integrated glossary with def initions for common terms - \"systematic review, placebo\" \u00b7 Messaging about The Cochrane Collaboration on every page \u00b7 \"Cochrane in the news\", Podcasts, related summaries, PEARLS, and other \"value -added \" content visible on relevant summary pages. Additional information about t he Collaboration, Cochrane Reviews, and evidence -based health care has been written in plain language to promote the site to non- Cochranites. [Only new features developed in 2013 have been described in this update.] This websi te was built through the combined effort of Chris Mavergames, Martin Janczyk, Lorne Becker and Catherine McIlwain. Cochrane Referee Training Plan Cochrane Training now boasts training options for consumers to learn about everything from clinical trials to systematic reviews (see http://training.cochrane.org/consumers ). Building on this development, the Cochrane Summaries and CCNet web pages now direct users to the Consumers tab on the Cochrane Training website for more information about all things Cochrane. Six new e -learning modules are being developed by Caroline Struthers which are adapted from the training videos of the ALOIS engagement project (alois.cochrane.org). ECRAN Part of an international partnership, CCNet has been awarded a grant to promote public education about and involvement in clinical trials. CCNet's involvement in the project has led to the creation o f an online database of consumer educational tools, websi tes and other communications devices which will be made available to a multi- lingual audience. The search engine will function in the six WHO languages, and the online interface will feature each flag from the European Union with translated interfaces in s everal languages. The project has successfully completed the first six months ' work, and following a positive review by the project officer, we will be awarded an additional 18 months ' work. Changes to Governance The CCSG's 'Action Items Spreadsheet' ha s been discontinued after all outstanding items from the last version in Auckland were completed or deleted as they were no longer applicable. Action items will in future be followed up in the Matters Arising section of the CCSG agenda, with the Secretaria t taking an active role in ensuring that all items are completed wherever possible ahead of the next CCSG meeting. Although not in post at the time, the CCSG passed a significant number of Action items to the CEO; and most of these have been started: \u00b7 The Oxford CCSG agenda was shortened , with more items targeted in the CEO and Editor in Chief's report; only major items for decision emerging from the Entity reports were included on the main agenda , with other reports labelled for information; and the length of the CCSG Oxford meeting shortened by half a day . These changes will be evaluated later in the year to see if they have helped the CCSG in its work. \u00b7 The strategic session for Oxford was designe d and arranged to focus on the Collaboration' s strategic plan. \u00b7 A Governance review process will be started later in 2013 -14 following completion of the updated Strategic Plan and the Secretariat restructuring. It is my view that the hosting costs associat ed with the business meetings in both the mid -year meetings and the Colloquium each year should be met from central Collaboration funds. The practice of reducing the Entities' \u00a310,000 funding to enable members to attend these meetings (primarily the mid-year gathering) with the room -hire and refreshment charges appears to me to be unfair. The costs of these things will vary considerably between hosting countries , and the growing size of attendance OPEN ACCESS at business meetings makes the financial burden on host orga nizations increasingly difficult to bear. I would recommend that in the next couple of months a decision be taken about the Collaboration accepting that these costs be met in the short -term future not by the host but from the central budget , until the plan ned full review of the Colloquium's function and place in the organization's work is completed. Official Relations with the World Health Organization A formal continuation of the Collaboration's Official Relations with WHO until 2015 was approved at the WHO's Executive Board meeting in February 2013. At th at meeting the Board commended ' the continuing dedication of [the Collaboration] in support of the work of WHO' . However, we can do more as an organisation to take advantage of the opportunities that our partnership with the WHO provides us, to be supported by the new Head of Communications & External Affairs ( subject to approval ). The priority activities for development will be informed by those listed in the WHO Working Group's1 paper to the Steering Gr oup, Auckland, September 2012, which include: \u00b7 Aligning regional WHO contacts with the institutions now part of the Cochrane Initiative to Build Global Capacity in Systematic Reviews (see above); \u00b7 Working with the Cochrane Editorial Unit to: o Align priority topics for Cochrane Review with WHO priorities as appropriate o Improve linkages between Cochrane content and WHO guidelines o Continue to consult Cochrane Review Groups on the WHO Essential Medicines Model lists ; \u00b7 Working with the Web Team to publicise the partnership more systematically and frequently . At the Auckland meeting the Steering Group approved the roll -over of the allocated budget for WHO activities that had been due to expire in 2013, meaning that a budget is already in place for increased activity. Administrative support could be provided by the assistant to the Head of Communications & External Affairs (subject to approval) . Cochrane Collaboration Discretionary Fund A total of \u00a313,711 has been spent to date in 2012- 13 from the Collaboration's Discretionary Fund, leaving \u00a31 ,289 in the Fund to financial year end on 31 March 2013. There are no outstanding applications. Awards were made as follows in 2012- 13: Cochrane Collaboration Discretionary Fund: 2012 -13 Expenditure Date Amount Entity Application funded for May 2012 \u00a32,280 Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Development of a consumer -friendly management interface to complement a mobile app to simplify screening as part of a systematic review. June 2012 \u00a32,050 RevMan Advisory Committee Meeting in Auckland, New Zealand on 29 September 2012. June 2012 \u00a34,920 RevMan Advisory Committee Meeting at CEU, London, UK, on 15 and 16 March 2013. November 2012 \u00a34,461 South African Cochrane Centre African Contributors' Meeting, May 2013 Total: \u00a313,711 Changes to the eligibility criteria for the Thomas C. Chalmers Award Yemisi Takwoingi and other colleagues on the Thomas C. Chalmers Award Standing Committee have proposed minor amendments to the eligibility criteria and I would recommend to the CCSG that these be adopted. The changes are as follows (for further details see Annex 3): 1. Evaluation of eligibility - The Committee recommend s that: ' The presenter will be assumed to be the first listed author, unless it is clearly stated other wise at the time of submission' [insert in 1 Lisa Bero, Lucie Binder, Paul Garner, Jeremy Grimshaw, Harriet MacLehose, Denise Thomson, Elizabeth Waters and Mark Wilson OPEN ACCESS italics] . The Committee concluded that it is inappropriate to award the prize for the oral presentation to a first author for work presented by someone else on the a uthor team who may well be a senior investigator. 2. According to the guidance document : 'The committee should make all reasonable efforts to ensure that the recipient of the Award fulfills the criteria' . The Committee propose s that at the time of submission of abstracts, submitters should also include a short biography of the first author if they would like the abstract considered for the award. Recommendations: 1. That the CCSG accept s the room and refreshment costs relatin g to the business meetings of the Entities be met from the central Collaboration budget, until the future arrangements of the Colloquia are decided by the CCSG following the planned review. 2. That the CCSG approve s the amendments to the eligibility crite ria of the Thomas C. Chalmers Award. Resource implications: There will be a relatively small financial cost to the Collaboration of agreeing to meet the room and refreshment costs. Decision required of the Steering Group : Most of this report is for information, apart from the decisions required for the two recommendations above. OPEN ACCESS Annex 1: Web Developments Report to the CCSG Oxford Mid- year Meeting, March 2013 Chris Mavergames, Director of Web Development, with contributions from the entire Web Team Executive Summary This report documents developments across the Collaboration's web presences during the past 6 months. Purpose To report on activities since the last Web Team report for Auckland. Urgency Low. For information only. Access Open. In this report: \u00b7 Web Team activities over the last 6 months - What have we accomplished since Auckland? \u00b7 Reports from the 4 work streams: \u00b7 Stats and figures. Programming & Web Development Community development, Support & Outreach Special Projects Content OPEN ACCESS 1 Web Team activities since Auckland | Highlights The six months since the Auckland Colloquium have been a busy and productive time for the Web Team. In addition to maintenance activities , there have been new developments in a number of areas . Highlights include: \u00b7 moving the summaries.cochrane.org site from beta to live \u00b7 ongoing development of Event/Colloquium Manager \u00b7 major new features, functionality and content on the 20th Anniversary website (anniversary.cochrane.org) \u00b7 the migration of the new Online Learning Modules from Moodle to Drupal on training.cochrane.org \u00b7 new features and websites in the Entity Website Builder system \u00b7 significant progress in the Cochrane Linked Data Project, among other activities . There are now a total of 136 websites under the Web Team's umbrella which are either live or in active development . More details about these and other developments are available below within the four work streams. Special note on Content Strategy The Web Team is working on all fronts to develop draft content strategies for our main websites. This includes Cochrane.org (Nancy), Summaries.cochrane.org (Catherine McIlwain), Community site on Cochrane.org (Caroline) and liaising with Harriet MacLehose in the CEU as she works on content strategy for The Cochrane Library . The aim, eventually, is to coordinate these content strategies, in conjunction with the forthcoming branding and messaging development, into a coherent, over -arching content strategy for Cochrane. We feel this work is important and high -priority as a well -developed content strategy can improve both end -user experience but also make us more efficient in producing and maintaining our content. For more info on content strategy, see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_strategy and this excellent book on the subject: http://contentstrategy.com/ . High -level streams of work 1. Content (development, curation and management, including marketing, communications and social media) . Lead: Nancy Owens 2. Programming and web development (including infrastructure and systems). Lead: Martin Janczyk 3. Community development, support and outreach . Lead: Caroline Mavergames OPEN ACCESS 4. Special projects . Lead: Chris Mavergames Lead: Nancy Owens Content developments Cochrane.org In addition to ongoing, regular maintenance of the site, the major areas of active content development include: \u00b7 Coordinating development, writing, production and scheduling of homepage features on Cochrane.org: scanning of entity newsletters to develop news items & features, reviewing Wiley press releases and new release lists for featured review possibilities . Coor dinating with CRGs and other Cochrane Entities on content development. There have been 11 new homepage features in the last six months for a total of 25 in the last 12 months. A significant increase as compared to 16 in the previous 12- month (2011 -12) time frame. \u00b7 Impact Stories resource/database The first version of the impact stories database is in beta testing ( http://www.cochrane.org/impact -stories ). This project is a Web Team/CEU -led effort to create a resource available to all Cochrane contributors that catalogs the impact of Cochrane evidence. Nancy Owens is taking the lead on inputting the backlog of stories, and the submission link is now available in the Community area of Cochrane.org. Usability has been improved, with a highly visible link provided for inputting stories, as well as filters to facilitate browsing and categorizing available information. About 80 stories have been input as of 25 February, including contributions from multiple sources, and work to raise awareness and coordinate efforts is ongoing. The next phase is to look at ways of using and disseminating impact stories. \u00b7 Curating the Cochrane Blog (http://www.cochrane.org/blog ) Soliciting original posts from Cochrane contributors, as well as seeking out and vetting suggestions for cross -posting. Current rate of posting about two per month; working to increase frequency. Summaries.cochrane.org The site moved from beta to live, but we are continuing to develop this site with both new content and in programming and functionality (see Programming section below as well). Current features of summaries: \u00b7 Search disambiguation by drug brand name now live using data from Drugbank.ca. \u00b7 \"Did you mean?\" search assistance for proximity -matching Content OPEN ACCESS \u00b7 Search in French, German or Spanish (Chinese coming soon ) with almost no English along the way - the interface is translated \u00b7 Integrated glossary with definitions for common terms - \"systematic review, placebo\" \u00b7 Messaging about the Cochrane Collaboration on every page \u00b7 \"Cochrane in the news\", Podcasts, related summaries, PEARLS, and other \"value- add\" content visible on relevant summary pages. \u00b7 Links to select, external websites including http://www.makingsenseofmsresearch.org.au/about -us/ (Sophie Hill) and other trusted partner sites. Social media \u00b7 Increasing social media presence on Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter; expanding amount and type of content disseminated via social media networks . Have established Cochrane presence on Google+ and revitalized Cochrane presence on YouTube with launch of Cochrane20 Video Series. \u00b7 Combined numbers of followers, members, \"friends\", etc. across social media networks as of 25 February 2013 exceed 22,000; averaging 200 new Twitter followers/week . The combined number has nearly doubled in the past 12 months from ca. 11,000 this time last year. \u00b7 Offering social media tutorials for UK Contributors' Meeting (and possibly Australasian Contributors' Meeting) to increase Cochrane participation in social media. Marketing and communications \u00b7 Working with CEU, COU and Wiley on coordinating messages and improving branding/messaging. Working with 20th Annivers ary Task Force to coordinate plans and initiatives with existing and planned Cochrane web presence frameworks. User -Centred Design and usability of Cochrane websites \u00b7 Upcoming consulting session In preparation for advice from the marketing and communications project, the Web Team will meet for a half -day consulting session with a consultant who specializes in User -Centred Design and usability/User -experience design in mid- March 2013. We hope to get a high -level idea of how we are doing, usability -wise, on our flagship site, Cochrane.org, as well as learn about the state- of-the-art in UX design and usability. OPEN ACCESS Lead: Martin Janczyk Programming and Web developments EU cookie law \u00b7 A recent e -privacy directive from the EU requires websites to inform visitors of how cookies are used on their websites. See: http://www.ico.gov.uk/for_organisations/privacy_and_electronic_communications/ the_guide/cookies.aspx and http://www.theeucookielaw.com/ . We recently added a message to all websites informing visitors of the cookies we use as this is now required in the EU and the UK, in particular, is looking to enforce this law. We updated the disclaimer page on Cochrane.org to provide information on how we use cookies: http://www.cochrane.org/disclaimer . The guidance on how to comply with the EU directive is quite fuzzy, but we researched various approaches taken by other websites and opted for an approach very similar to the http://ft.com , though with a less -invasive pop-up message. Event Manager \u00b7 The UK Symposium and Quebec Colloquium are currently using the system. Training will be offered in Quebec for future organizers of Colloquia. Several Cochrane groups have expressed interest in using the system for regional meetings or other events. The next aim is to release a stable version with the main focus on improving the administration interface for the organizers and producing a user manual. New Entity Websites \u00b7 All entity sites are now on the main web server, which has undergone a substantial upgrade to improve performance and stability . \u00b7 We are preparing a system to migrate all CRG modules to entity websites in advance of publish- when- ready going live in June. \u00b7 e-Newsletter system pilot is running . 8 entity sites are now using this new feature/system with one group, Acute Respiratory Infections, having successfully sent their first e -newsletter. Programming and web development in \"Core\" Websites \u00b7 summaries.cochrane.org The site moved from beta to live, but we are continuing to develop this site. Major developments include: improvement of the search engine to better support Asian characters; full integration of the translation exchange; keep interface translation up to date; other technical, backend updates (server configuration). \u00b7 methods.cochrane.org beta New site for Methods information. Being developed in coordination with Jackie Chandler and Maria Burgess. Programming & Web Development OPEN ACCESS \u00b7 training.cochrane.org The Moodle course system is being moved into D rupal, this will give full control over design and presentation of courses and better integration with Archie roles and workflows. \u00b7 anniversary.cochrane.org The photo archive now has more than 4200 photos (http://anniversary.cochrane.org/photo -archive ) and -etc) with subtitles in several languages were added. The 20th Anniversary publications and meetings database is now live and accepting submissions: http://anniversary.cochrane.org/share- details -about Impact database/resource on Cochrane.org Beta version of the form can be found at http://cochrane.org/node/add/impact -story . Developed in conjunction with the CEU as a resource for storing, tagging and providing access to stories about the i mpact of Cochrane evidence. Browse interface beta is at: http://www.cochrane.org/impact -stories . \u00b7 Colloquia abstracts to Drupal Migration of Colloquia abstracts from all years currently stored in the OJS system to the Drupal content management system complete. Web Team is now working from a final list of requirements from CPAC to finalize the interface before going live with a beta version of the site for testing and user feedback. Lead: Caroline Mavergames \u00b7 The first issue of the Web Team Newsletter was published in January 2013 and mailed to the following lists: ccsg, CentralStaff, centres, coeds, fields, mes, methods - groups, tscs . The Newsletter will be published quarterly with issues scheduled for April, July and October. Personal feedback from core teams colleagues was very good. Google Analytics shows that the issues had 143 unique page views in the first week and the average t ime users spent on the full -text page was 3.51 minutes. \u00b7 Cochrane Community Area of Cochrane.org There are now more than ca. 2,000 Cochrane contributors using the Community area of Cochrane.org. There have been more than 400+ forum topic posts with over ca. 1,200 comments total in the various forums since their inception. o An expanded and updated version of the Web Team's Guide to Collaborating Online was published in November 2012, http://www.cochrane.org/community/collaboration-communication/guide -collaborating- online . Community development Support & Outreach OPEN ACCESS o A featured resource display was added to the Community homepage. It has featured the revised Guide to Collaborating Online and the 20th Anniversary site, and will next feature summaries.cochrane.org which is out of beta. o The Development & Projects section now includes an archive for completed projects. Editorial responsibility for the individual project pages lies in the hand of their proj ect managers. o The TSC Portal , the first role- based portal, went live in September and now functions as the main resource for TSCs as well as for information on the CRS ( http://www.cochrane.org/community/tsc -portal ). The ME Portal is still in development in conjunction with the Entity Execs. Progress on this and other projects lead by the Web Team depends on input and work carried out within the various groups in the Coll aboration. \u00b7 We have begun creating a public Web Team website which will include information on our core work streams and projects, the sites we support and the support we offer, special projects, information about the team, site and social media statistics and current webs development news of interest to the Cochrane Community. We have established the core site architecture and will add content and establish a system for adding dynamic news content for the site to go live by the end of Q2. \u00b7 We have put toget her a scoping document for information and consideration by Mark Wilson to tie together projects concerned with engaging Cochrane contributors, namely Getting involved, authors.cochrane.org, the E xpression- of-Interest database and the Review Tasker project s combined with a proposal to explore the creation of a coherent peer -to-peer network for Cochrane.org. The projects of updating of the Getting involved process and its related web resources as well as the authors.cochrane.org website are therefore on hold. Lead: Chris Mavergames Highlights \u00b7 Cochrane Linked Data project Following on from a successful 3 -day meeting in London in early December 2012, a Linked Data Project Board has been formed to scope, plan and provide a business case and expected resource implications for moving this project forward. Chris Mavergames and J essica Thomas are co- chairing the Project Board and the aim is to finish a specific set of proposals and recommendations to go to Mark and the Steering Group by mid- April. More information here: http://www.cochrane.org/community/development - projects/cochrane -linked -data-project Special Projects OPEN ACCESS \u00b7 Translations project The Web Team has been working with the Translation Working Group and IMS to gather and publish translations of abstracts and PLSs of Cochrane Reviews on summaries.cochrane.org including translation of the interface and navigation in French, Spanish and Sim plified Chinese. There are now 100 translations in Simplified Chinese, around 2500 in French, and around 4500 in Spanish. The Ibero -American Centre has resumed their translation project and publication via Update Software, and we have now started retrieving the new translations on a monthly basis. \u00b7 Equity Evidence Aid (now called E4E - Evidence for Equity) Chris attended a 2 - day meeting in London in mid- February with the E4E team, Peter Tugwell, Jordi Pardo, Vivian Welch and others, to explore development and publication of this new special collection and tool for policy -makers assisting disadvantaged populations. The collection and \"friendly front -end\" for this resource will be built at a sub- domain of Cochrane.org throughout 2013 with the aim of going live with a beta site by year's end.

OPEN ACCESS Annex 2: Information Management System (IMS): status report Prepared by Jessica Thomas on behalf of the IMS Team, 1st March 2013 Purpose To provide a status report on the work of the IMS Team (including IMS Development and Support teams) since September 2012. Projects completed within the last six months Archie 3.10 & 3.11 Archie 3.10 was released on 13th of December 2012 and was primarily updated the application server on which Archie is running from JBoss version 5 to 7. Although such changes deliver little immediate value to end users, it is important to maintain the infra structure. The update provided efficiency gains in the d evelopment process, and a minor general performance increase. Minor bug fixes and new features were also added. Archie 3.11 was released on February 19th 2013. The main changes involved the introduction of a new Monitoring form A and some changes to improve Archie use on a mobile device including a change to support the right -click menu. For more information on 3.10 & 3.11 please see the full list: http://ims.cochrane.org/archie/new - releases/whats- new. RevMan 5.2 released for all RevMan 5.2 was released to DTA authors only in September 2012 and on the 29th of November 2012 it was made available to all authors, with some further bug fixes in January 2013. The changes to this version primar ily affected Diagnostic Test Accuracy (DTA) reviews, and therefore it is not compulsory to upgrade RevMan for authors writing non- DTA reviews. The full list of new functions are available on the following link: http://ims.cochrane.org/revman/new -releases/whats- new-in- revman -5. Ongoing projects Support of users As of 1st of October IMS support persons (Sonja Henderson, Becky Gray, Liz Dooley and Karen Hovhannisyan) ceased to be in post. To support use of IMS systems, a new system exists. All Managing Editors now have an ME Support system to contact in the first instance with any query concerning the ME role including use of IMS systems. They are also encouraged to contact the IMS via our suggestion form on the IMS website if the issue is more technical. To support other users the IMS team appointed Karen Hovhannisyan in October 2012 to manage the emails concerning Archie and RevMan use. We still have some gaps with documentation support and training which we previously had with the IMS Support team. Cochrane content The work related to the Cochrane Content is ongoing, some of which is included in this report, and the team are becoming more familiar with the use of Wrike which stor es all the projects. OPEN ACCESS Publish When Ready Plans and implementation for Publish When Ready are going well. The date for release is now set as June 2013. Testing for parts of the functionality are being conducted by Wiley. Linked Data Project Board Jessica an d Rasmus are involved in the Linked Data Project Board which is now meeting on a weekly basis to draw up recommendations for the Collaboration on how this project could be implemented. The aim is to produce a Project Board report by mid -April 2013 for cons ideration by Mark Wilson and the Steering Group. Translation Exchange After the release of the translation exchange in Archie 3.9 the IMS have continued to support the work involved with current translations of abstracts and plain language summaries. Archi e is now used for managing and publishing over 3600 French translations. In addition to this we are contributing to training for the Iberoamerican and French Cochrane Centre. We have also begun work with importing Chinese translations and it's anticipated that some of these will go live during March 2013. Generic Protocols and Revert to Protocol From a Review This project concerns two issues of being able to publish a Generic Protocol which is the seed to several reviews and on being able to Revert to a Protocol and publish it for a title that has already been published as a review. Wiley are working on their side of this project and a format has been agreed on how it should be implemented. We don't have a date for release as yet, but the changes on the IMS side should be relatively easy to implement. Feedback The Feedback project was put on hold in late 2012, but it is hoped to be picked up again during 2013 now the contract with Wiley is finalised. Future projects and other issues Mobile technology The IMS team have invested some time in improving the current Archie interface so that it is more mobile friendly. We plan on setting up a training day with the IMS team, with the option of other Cochrane teams joining, on HTML5 and JQuery to support our inte rnal learning about mobile technology developments. We are keen to hear from Collaboration members on their interest in pursuing this project including wishlist items or projects that they feel that mobile technology could help address. RevMan 6 wishlist The IMS team have been working closely with the RAC Convenors to further define the final RevMan 6 project list. The IMS team attended the Auckland RAC meeting in September 2012, a two- day meeting in London in December 2012 and hosted an IMS, RAC Convenor and Methods meeting in Copenhagen in February 2013. Our mission with RevMan 6 is to make RevMan as efficient as possible for authors, to plan for flexibility in review methods and quality assurance tools, but also to keep the update fairly lean so that the IMS team can start exploring the possibility of moving RevMan online in the future (with offline functionality enabled to support limited internet access). RevMan 6 is scheduled to be released late 2014. OPEN ACCESS Archie 3.12 and future Archie development needs Archie 3.12 is estimated to be released in early April 2013. This will primarily be a continuation of implementing decisions rated as 'Important' or 'Desirable' by ADAC, but will also include some improvements to the Translation Exchange and functionality to support the change to Publish When Ready. Workflow Some steps were taken in Archie 3.11 to consolidate the workflow system due to some issues with the current system inappropriately aborting workflows. We are evaluating the recent changes and analysing wh ether further steps are required to make the workflows engine more stable. Integration with CRS and other external software The IMS team and CRS have been communicating about the further integration of CRS data in to RevMan. It will be beneficial to this process to have a clearer roadmap of what data and functionality will be included in the CRS over the coming years. A new version of the GradePro software for producing Summary of Findings tables for reviews is in development and we are liaising with t he developers about how RevMan and GradePro can exchange data efficiently. We are drawing up a list of all available software that supports the process of writing a systematic review and plan to publish it on our website and encourage comments from users regarding their experience of the software. We have also had a first meeting with ReGroup to enable access for data to feed in to RevMan. Future Technology exploration Starting at the beginning of 2013 the IMS team have set up monthly 'Future Technology' meetings. The focus of these meetings is to explore technology developments to see how they might be integrated in to our systems to further support the Collaboration's work. Social Media Strategy In order to improve our communications channels, we a re currently assessing the need for a social media strategy in platforms such as Twitter or Facebook. We envision that developing such a system will provide better support to our users and assist us with promoting our current and future projects. Any syste m we create is likely to use our website as the central space for sharing information to the various platforms. Administrator and Testing and Documentation Officer We successfully recruited a new System Administrator, Javier Mayoral, who began with us in January 2013. Javier will take on the System Administrator post along with supporting the IT requirements of the Nordic Cochrane Centre for the Righospitalet. Olga Ahtirschi has been on maternity leave from the IMS team since June 2012 and will return to h er testing role with us in mid -April 2013. Facts about Archie At the end of January 2013, there were more than 15,500 users of Archie (an increase of approximately 4000 users over a one -year period). The database stores nearly 39,000 person records, of which more than 20,500 are active authors. There are 12,448 indiv idual review records covering more than 450,000 versions. There are more than 14,500 running workflows. For more facts about Archie, updated quarterly, visit http://ims.cochrane.org/archie/facts- on-archie . OPEN ACCESS Annex 3: Thomas C Chalmers MD Award The Thomas C Chalmers MD Award honours the work of Thomas Clark Chalmers, an outspoken advocate of randomized trials and one of the most creative thinkers and investigators in the field. Always ahead of his time, in 1977 Tom advocated that in the face of uncertainty doctors should \"randomize the first patient!\" At the same time he advocated for registration of clinical trials, and later was one of the first in medicine to do systematic reviews. Tom dedicated his long clinical and research career to examini ng the effectiveness of healthcare interventions using randomized trials and meta -analysis. Tremendously creative and productive, Tom served as a mentor to many students and members of The Cochrane Collaboration. He died on 27 th December 1995. The Award f unds have been donated by Tom's family and friends to commemorate him and his important contribution to the development of systematic reviews. Eligibility The Thomas C Chalmers MD Award has been awarded at each Cochrane Colloquium since 1994 for the best oral or poster presentation. Accepted posters and oral presentations are eligible for the Award if they: \u00b7 Are presented by an early -career investigator; and \u00b7 Address methodological issues related to systematic rev iews. From 2005 separate Awards have been made for the best oral and the best poster presentations. It was also decided at that time that an individual could in future receive the Award only once. Members of the Selection Panel are not eligible. Evaluation of eligibility The presenter will be assumed to be the first listed author, unless it is clearly stated otherwise at the time of submission. For oral presentations, to be considered eligible for the award, the first author must also be the pres enter at the Colloquium. This additional criterion does not apply to poster presentations. An early career investigator is considered to be one who is (i) no more than 7 years after their last education or professional qualification (e.g. bachelor, diploma, masters, doctorate, etc.); and (ii) not having held an academic (or equivalent research - orientated) appointment for longer than 7 years in total. Career interruptions or delays for the purpose of childrearing, illness, health -related family responsibil ities or non - research clinical training (residency, etc.) do not count towards these 7 years. When submitting an abstract to the Colloquium, the submitter should declare whether the presenter is eligible for the Thomas C Chalmers Award ('self evaluation' o f eligibility), and whether such person would like to be considered for the Award. In OPEN ACCESS addition, the submitter should provide a short biography of the first author so that the Committee can check early career status if necessary. Members of the selection panel (either members of the Committee or assessors at the Colloquium) are not eligible for the prize, so must either withdraw from the committee or withdraw their presentation from consideration. The committee should make all reasonable efforts to ensure that the recipient of the Award fulfills the criteria. Assessment criteria Eligible oral presentations and posters must demonstrate: \u00b7 originality of thought \u00b7 high quality science \u00b7 relevance for the advancement of the science of systematic reviews \u00b7 clarity of presentation Each of these four components is rated equally on a ten- point scale (maximum 40 points per paper) by a panel of independent assessors who comprise the Selection Panel. The sum of the assessors' scores is used as the primary component in th e Award decision. Value of the Award The winner in each category receives US$500. Where the paper has multiple authors, the Award is presented to the first named author, who is responsible for deciding how the Award is shared. If ther e is a tie within a category, the recipients split the Award. Selection Panel The Thomas C Chalmers MD Award Selection Panel comprises members of the Standing Committee (see Governance below) plus several ad hoc assessors with expertise in systematic reviewing or systematic review methodology. Assessors are nominated by the Standing Committee. There are no fixed terms for assessors to serve on the Selection Panel. This is partly because not all assessors attend every Colloquium, and partly because the numbe r of assessors required may vary from year to year depending on the number of papers submitted and the availability of members of the Standing Committee. Governance In April 2002, the Cochrane Collaboration Steering Group approved the establishment of standing committees to oversee all aspects of the administration and governance of the Collaboration's awards and prizes. The Standing Committee of the Thomas C Chalmers MD Award comprises ten members who serve renewable terms of three years on average. Ideally, three members of the Committee step down each year to ensure continuity, but the number of members stepping down in any year may vary depending on the likely availability of members for current and future OPEN ACCESS colloquia. The Chair is nominated from within the Committee and should undertake to attend the Colloquium in the year that he/she is chair. The C ommittee is responsible for appointing replacements as members step down. The Standing Committee should consist of members of the Methods Groups of The Cochrane Collaboration and be expanded to consist of ten members. At least two members should represent the Statistical Methods Group, two members the Screening and Diagnostic Tests Methods Group, and one member the Prognosis Methods Group. Members should als o be regular Colloquium attendees.

OPEN ACCESS Editor in Chief 's Report to Cochrane Collaboration Steering Group, mid-year meeting 2013 Prepared by: Jackie Chandler, Ruth Foxlee, John Tovey Date: 3rd March 2013 Purpose: To inform the Steering Group in relation to current progress of work that is the responsibility of the Editor in Chief and Cochrane Editorial Unit (CEU). Urgency: Moderate Access: Open Current status: ............................................................................................................................................................................................................. 2 Review of current projects ........................................................................................................................................................................................... 5 Strategic objective ................................................................................................................................................................................................... 5 1.

However, the current workload of the CEU is unsustainable. We recently looked at a snapshot of how the time of the information specialist, methods coordinator, and editors (excluding the Editor in Chief) is utilized, by broad category. This demonstrated that the largest category of work undertaken is in providing support in different ways to individuals and groups within the Collaboration, and also that overall we are working above capacity. Over the past few years the CEU has absorbed additional work without increase in resources , but this is no longer f easible . To date we have not been able to implement proposals using the designated income from Wiley in support of Dr Cochrane and Cochrane Clinical Answers to appoint a clinical editor specifically for these projects. Orla Ni Ogain is currently filling th is role, and has done so very effectively, but we are short of this resource, pending a successful appointment. Given the workload of the CEU it would be useful to receive feedback from the Steering Group, and others, in the light of the current proposed re-structuring of the expanded Secretariat, what should be the key objectives for the CEU and what would be an appropriate time and resource investment in each of the following area s of activity. 1. Managing the quality, relevance , and utility of Cochrane Reviews We propose to discuss the issues raised by recent critical incidents in the Co -ordinating Editors Board meetings at the midyear meeting 2013 in Oxford, and specifically to ask the questions outlined at the end of this secti on. The CEU proposes to prioritise screening all published protocols and a sample of new reviews, partly in order to estimate the resource implications of a broader approach. OPEN ACCESS 2. Developing derivative products Derivative products are seen as a \" robust strate gy\" for ensuring the Collaboration's continuing sustainability in an open access world. We currently work on Dr Cochrane, Cochrane Clinical Answers and on The Cochrane Library iPad app, but potentially this work could expand further in the future. 3. Developing additional content e.g. Journal Club, Browse menu, editorials, special collections, improving feedback management . 4. Supporting dissemination and knowledge translation more broadly , working with editorial base staff, review authors and others suc h as Cochrane Centre staff to identify the key dissemination strategies for individual reviews. 5. Supporting the Collaboration and its processes : e.g. RevMan, Linked data projects, ME Support, Publishing and Editorial Policy Manual, Editorial Resources Committee, MECIR, monitoring and registration support, methods strategy development. 6. Working with our publishers and others on development of our products and improving user experience . 7. Supporting the management and oversight of the publishing contract. 8. Building partnerships e.g. WHO guidelines networks, guidelines groups 9. Supporting Cochrane Innovations e.g. Cochrane Response . OPEN ACCESS Questions for Steering Group and other stakeholders : Review quality \u00b7 Is there agreement that there should be an additional quality assurance level in addition to current sign -off arrangements? \u00b7 Should this apply equally to protocols, new reviews and updates? \u00b7 Should this apply to output from all or a random sample of all groups, or be targeted? \u00b7 Where should responsibility for this activity sit? Can it be shared between CEU and editorial groups? Use of resources Our snapshot recently demonstrated that the most time consuming aspect of the CEU's work is in support of the Collaboration a nd its groups, closely followed by work on derivative products. \u00b7 What does the Steering Group see as the primary objectives of the CEU? \u00b7 Are there specific changes that the Steering Group would like to see in relation to how the CEU prioritises its work? OPEN ACCESS Review of current projects The Cochrane Content Publication and Delivery Programme was developed after the Strategic Session a t the midyear meeting in Paris in 2012. The programme comprises 3 distinct workstreams: \u00b7 Development of The Cochrane Library and user experience \u00b7 Content creation and quality \u00b7 Dissemination and impact In the following sections the individual elements of the programme are placed in the context of the strategic objectives identified by the Collaboration. Strategic objective 1. Improve the quality and relevance of The Cochrane Library . MECIR and PLEACS projects GREEN /AMBER The MECIR project continues on track. The conduct and reporting standards are in place and we are well advanced in ensuring t hat the ERC checklists, online training materials and Handbook reflect the standards. The convenors of the RevMan Advisory Committe e are working closely with the IMS team to ensure that the standards feature prominently in the next version of Review Manager. Toby Lasserson has drafted the next stage of the MECIR implementation plan , for further discussion and consultation at the mid- year meetings, and we are also planning the work on revising the standards to accommodate updating reviews. Plain Language Expectations for Authors of Cochrane Summaries (PLEACS): report by Catherine McIlwain OPEN ACCESS The PLEACS group concluded a year -long Delphi decision -making process which involved a dedicated group of consumers, methodologists, MEs, Co -Ordinating Editors, Managing Editors and representatives from the Central Editorial Unit. Through a collaborative process with Cochrane Review stakeholders, mandatory standards for plain language summaries (PLS) were finalized in February 2013. The standards for PLS will be implemented alongside the MECIR standards according to a schedule that will be presented at the Mid -Year Meeting. The MECIR standards, including the new standards for PLS, will be printed for the Collaboration as a booklet of recommendations which c an accompany the Cochrane Handbook. The next portion of the PLEACS project will see the larger w orking group divided into two smaller groups with different purposes. To aid implementation of the standard, the first group will focus on format recommendations (i.e. the look and feel of the PLS), whi le the second group will design tools and guidance ma terials for authors and Managing Editors to utilize the standards. An update on the progress of these two groups will follow in the next report. 2. Improve the usability and impact of The Cochrane Library . Search GREEN Phase 2 of the new search interface for The Cochrane Library was launched in December 2012. New features included: \u00b7 Approximate spelling feature (\"Did you mean?\") \u00b7 Combining search lines using shorthand notation \u00b7 Easy sharing of search strategies via email \u00b7 Direct keying of MeSH term(s) and/or qualifiers OPEN ACCESS \u00b7 Set/remove an alert on a saved search strategy \u00b7 Display of the database/issue being searched on the search results page With the publishing contract signed, a reassessment of the outstanding search functionality items is now underw ay with a view to delivering a third phase. Publish when ready: GREEN The move to publish when ready has knock -on effects in other areas, such as identifying reviews ahead of print and the 'About The Cochrane Collaboration' database, and we are man aging these as well. The CEU has a process to identify reviews ahead of publication to inform the preparation of dissemination activities (including press releases and podcasts), editorials and the iPad issue, and the Cochr ane Review browse list on the hom epage of The Cochrane Library. We have had to develop new processes to allow us to gain this information in advance. The 'About The Cochrane Collaboration' database is affected, particularly for Cochrane Review Groups, because modules are updated and publi shed monthly in line with the current monthly publication of Cochrane Protocols and Reviews. We are continuing to explore how best to implement a solution for this that will involve most of the module content being held on individual entity websites with l ive feeds to The Cochrane Library so the information needs to be updated in one place only. Web development programme AMBER There are a number of technology -dependent projects included in the Cochrane Content Publication and Delivery Programme aimed at increasing the utility and impact of Cochrane content . We expect these to start to deliver within 2013. The CEU is working with CRGs and fields to improve the utility and function of the homepage browse. These p rojects identified during the 2012 Strategic Se ssion mainly come under the banner of the Wiley work programme known as \"Cochrane 2.0\", and we anticipate that they will progress substantially durin g 2013. OPEN ACCESS \u00b7 Improved online presentation of reviews based on the Wiley \"anywhere article\" \u00b7 Developme nt of the capability to publish different article types within CDSR \u00b7 Better presentation and sign- posting of non- English content \u00b7 Further development of apps for different vehicles e.g . Android smartphones \u00b7 Development of a new platform for The Cochrane Library \u00b7 Further improvements to browse function on homepage Editorials, Special Collections and other added value content GREEN Editorials: The CEU commissioned and published 14 editorials over the last 12 months. This includes the first two in a series of 20th anniversary editorials to be published during 2013. \u00b7 Improving outcomes in gynaecological cancer: the benefits of subspecialisation (March 2012) \u00b7 The COMET (Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials) Initiative: its role in improving Cochrane Reviews (April 2012) \u00b7 Hospital at home in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: is it a viable option (May 2012) \u00b7 Why should we tr anslate Cochrane Reviews into French?

(January 2013) OPEN ACCESS \u00b7 A new search interface for The Cochrane Library (February 2013) \u00b7 Preventing falls in older people: the story of a Cochrane review (20th anniversary editorial, February 2013) Special collections: The CEU worked with CRGs and Fields to create 6 new and 2 updated Special Collections: \u00b7 Preventi ng falls and fall- related injuries in older people (February 2013) \u00b7 Tuberculosis (updated January 2013) \u00b7 World AIDS Day 2012 (November 2012) \u00b7 World Toilet Day 2012 (temporary collection; November 2012) \u00b7 Avoiding unnecessary blood transfusion (July 2012) \u00b7 Physical activity and exercise for health and well being of older people (May 2012) \u00b7 World No Tobacco Day (updated May 2012) \u00b7 World Kidney Day 2012: kidneys for life (April 2012) CEU members are involved in discussion s with Megan Helmers (Wiley) and Nancy Owens (web team) to look through the various World Awareness Days, select appropriate ones, and consider how each could be best covered, perhaps via Special Collections. The CEU also works with the Evidence Aid team to maintain and keep updated 4 Cochrane Library Special Collections: \u00b7 Cochrane Evidence Aid: resources for earthquakes \u00b7 Cochrane Evidence Aid: resources for burns \u00b7 Cochrane Evidence Aid: resources for flooding and poor water sanitation \u00b7 Cochrane Evidence Aid: resources for post- traumatic stress disorder following natural disasters OPEN ACCESS Podcasts: Mike Clarke , as podcast editor, continues to lead the production of podcasts and the monthly Journal Club working with review authors , our publishers and the Cochrane web team. The CEU continues to write and record monthly round- up podcasts each month, in collaboration with the Web team. Round -ups are published on Cochrane.org/podcasts and on iTunes alongside the standard podcasts. Each round -up lasts about 20 minutes and pr ovides an overview of what's new on The Cochrane Library , including a selection of the podcasts recorded for the current issue. The CEU also worked with authors and others to create occasional additional podcasts based on Cochrane Library editorials or oth er events. iPad app GREEN The iPad application had a soft launch at about the time of the Auckland Colloquium. To date there have been 4 issues alongside the regular online publication schedule. At the time of writing it is unclear what level of uptake has been achieved, and the iPad app is currently freely available worldwide. Each issue contains about a dozen new or updated reviews selected by the CEU team and an Editor's Choice commentary. The reviews are abridged to include the summary version s, selected sections of text from the full review and key figures. The iPad app can be downloaded via Itunes at: https://itunes.apple.com/app/id573181475 OPEN ACCESS In the near future, we hope that the app will be available for other delivery vehicles e.g. android and Blackberry smartphones. Derivative products GREEN The CEU ha s been working with Karen Pettersen ( Editor, Cochrane Clinical Answers) , on editing and signing off Cochrane C linical Answers (CCAs) prior to publication. The sign -off process has comprised consideration of clinical content in the CCAs and verification of data from associated Cochr ane Reviews . The sign -off process has highlighted some issues with some of the associated Coc hrane R eviews, which have been discussed within the CEU team and with Review groups, as appropriate. The CEU ha s also been working with Karen Pettersen and associate editors on a temporary basis, creating CCAs to increase the speed of production. As of February 28th, 93 CCAs have been signed -off and published. OPEN ACCESS The CEU team has been worki ng with the Dr Cochrane team editing and signing off Dr Cochrane vignettes. Similar to the CCA sign -offs, the process has involved consideration of clinical content and verification of data from associated Cochr ane Reviews. However, the Dr Cochrane sign-off process has additionally involved consideration of the narrative portion of the vignette . 19 Dr Cochrane vignettes have been completely signed -off by the CEU and are g oing through copy editing . A further 9 vignettes have been reviewed once by the CEU and are currently undergoing revisions before CEU sign -off can be completed . Linked Data project N/A The Linked Data project is a crucial technology development project in that it has the potential both to improve the efficiency, and therefore timeliness of review production, and also to allow us to present and deliver Cochrane Content in innovative ways - thereby expanding the range of potential derivative produc ts. The CEU continues to support our colleagues in the web team and our publishers to identify opportunties and exploit this technology. Work with guidelines groups AMBER The CEU has continued to maintain links with guidelines developers and to explore potential collaborations, efficiencies, impact, and funding opportunities. The main focus has been with G -I-N. Following a meeting at the 2012 G -I-N conference there has been progress towards a closer partnership with G -I-N and relevant sessions at the 2013 G -I-N conference and the 2013 Cochrane Colloquium. The CEU also met with representatives from the UK National Clinical Guidelines C entre at the Royal College of Physicians in London with a view to identifying areas of collaboration with CRGs and/o r CEU, and continues to maintain relationships with other branches of NICE and SIGN. OPEN ACCESS The CEU is also liaising with Ann Eisinga at the UKCC, who has been working to identify guidelines associated with individual systematic reviews, and vice versa. We believ e that this work, due to completed in March 2013, could be enormously valuable in helping to provide direct from Cochrane Reviews to applicable clinical guidelines on The Cochrane Library and for demonstrating impact, especially if this work can be combine d with equivalent work in other regions. Wikipedia and Cochrane working together BLUE In December 2012, Wikipedia representatives took part in a teleconference with members of the CEU, COU, and Wiley to discuss each other's interest in sharing information from Cochrane Reviews within the relevant Wikipedia articles and to discuss how we could formalize an arrangement to do this. The outcome of the call was a commitment to explore different approaches to do this, including develo ping a partnershi p, improved information sharing about Wikipedia with Cochrane groups , facilitating access of Wikipedia editors to Cochrane Reviews, different approaches to liaising with editors to modify content, and a Wikipedia editor -in-residence programme. Discussions are ongoing and we will develop a strategy over the coming months. Feedback monitoring AMBER The CEU has continued to monitor all incoming feedbac k submitted on Cochrane Reviews , working with colleagues at Wiley or in CRGs to resolve issues when needed. A report of all feedback submitted during 2012 is in preparation and will be shared before the midyear meeting. A more detailed analysis of feedback received and its impact on Cochrane Reviews is being prepared for the 2013 Colloquium. In addition, during late 2012 the CEU worked with Wiley and the IMS team to develop the technical and business specifications for new systems for the submission, processing, and display of Comments on Cochrane Reviews. This work was put on hold while publishing contra ct negotiations took place, but will resume in 2013. This work is in three phases: OPEN ACCESS 1. Develop a new system for submitting and handling incoming comments (temporary system now in place) 2. Incoming comments to be stored in Archie, and transferred to and fro m The Cochrane Library as needed, with associated workflows. 3. A new way of rendering comments, separately from the review (to be included in forthcoming Cochrane Library homepage re design work) but presented alongside the review and clearly linked to the appropriate version of the review . The CEU also continues to advis e and support managing editors and feedback editors in the handling of feedback. Revised guidelines for the handling of comments, as well as a feedback editor job description will be available in mid -2013, following consultation with CRGs. 3. Provide better support for Cochrane groups and individuals worldwide as they seek to implement the vision and mission of the Collaboration. Support for publishing contract renewal GREEN David Tovey and Harriet MacLehose were members of the Project Board of the Future Publishing Arrangements Project (FPAP) and also the core team working day -to-day on this project. The FPAP work involved development of the terms of reference for the project, the development of a detailed RFP outlining our publishing requirements, detailed negotiations, drafting and refining the contrac t, and extensive research and consulation throughout. FPAP reached a successful conclusion with signature of the new contract with John Wiley & Sons, effective 1 February 2013. Both will continue to serve on the management team as part of the oversight of the new contract. ME Support GREEN OPEN ACCESS Managing Editor (ME) Support started on 1 October 2012 and provides induction training, ongoing training, and support to MEs in all aspects of their role within a Cochrane Review Group. The ME Support team is made up of Liz Dooley, Rebecca Gray, and Anupa Shah each working one day per week. Sonja Henderson has been providing team support and helped set up ME Support. Harriet MacLehose is the ME S upport Manager. The team has developed a wo rk-plan, approved by the ME's Executive, with six areas of work and several activities in each area. Some developments in each of these areas are listed below. OPEN ACCESS Table 1. ME Support: areas of support and progress to date Area of work Progress to date (1) Recruit a ME Support team and set up effective team processes, management, and training to support the ME Support team's work \u00b7 ME Support team recruited. \u00b7 Regular team meetings, website, and administrative systems set up. \u00b7 Recently moved from a shared email account to customer helpdesk support software (Fogbugz) to improve how we monitor and respond to queries. \u00b7 Identifying and meeting team's training needs. (2) Provide support on any aspect of the ME role, and induction training as required, to individual MEs \u00b7 Providing support and training to MEs on all aspects of their role via phone, Skype (screensharing), and email. \u00b7 Three site visits completed, with two more planned. \u00b7 Developed policy on providing support to MEs in CRG Satellites. (3) Contribute to the Collaboration's training programme for MEs \u00b7 Developed a training needs assessment survey for MEs in collaboration with Sally Bell - Syer (MEs' Executive co -convenor), the Training Working Group Co -ordinators and Steve McDonald, and Jes sica Thomas (IMS Team Manager). We will use the results to develop a training programme for MEs and identify the responsibilities of the different teams in delivering this. Due to be completed by April 2013. \u00b7 Assessing workflow uptake and developing a plan to work with MEs of CRGs where additional support is needed. (4) Contribute to the development of training resources for MEs \u00b7 Completed a major revision of the ME training checklists used for site training visits. \u00b7 Collaborated with the MEs' Executive on the development of an online portal for MEs on the cochrane.org 'Community' site. (5) Communicate ME Support's activities and achievements to the MEs, and being proactive in engaging with MEs \u00b7 We have been sharing news from ME Support via the CEU Bulletin, but we recently agreed with the MEs' Executive to develop a ME Support Bulletin specifically for the MEs. (6) Evaluate the use of ME Support and report back to the ME's Executive and Collaboration \u00b7 We collect information on the number and types of queries reaching ME Support and are considering ways to collate and share this information. \u00b7 Shared work -plan with MEs' Executive and agreed ways to share information. \u00b7 Reports prepared as needed. OPEN ACCESS Updating Support BLUE We recognise tha t the burden of updating is considerable for both CRG team s and review authors . When asked to speak to a session at the AHRQ conference in September this year, I reported on the project funded by the NHS Engagement Award scheme in 2010 -1. One aspect of this was to provide external consultancy in support of review authors and CRGs for high priority updates. At the time the qualitative evaluation was somewhat positive, hence I was surprised to find that at the time I was prep aring my presentation only 2 revie ws had been published. I therefore asked Orla Ni Ogain to undertake a new evaluation to try to explore the apparent mismatch between an apparently popular project and what seemed to be disappoi nting outputs. Orla's full report in included in the Appendix C , but the Executive summary is included here. \"Summary description: This report describes the findings of semi -structured interviews with six Cochrane Review Groups (CRGs) carried out between December 2012 and February 2013 to follow up on the centralised updating pilot project conducted in 2010/11. An update on the publication status of reviews as of January 2013 was sought, and participants were asked to identify any continuing barriers to publication following centralised updating support. They were als o asked to reflect on the successes/weaknesses of the centralised updating model or to suggest alternative updating forms of assistance, bearing in mind the final goal of increasing the number of updates publishe d. Results: Six interviews were conducted w ith editorial base staff - four current Managing Editors (ME), one former ME, and one Coordinating Editor. One ME communicated by email only. Four of the 14 review updates included in the centralised updating pilot project have been published as of January 2013; one is due for publication in Issue 2, 2013, and remainder are with the author or the editorial group. Participants identified issues that can be grouped into five major themes: 1) the selection of appropriate reviews; 2) communication and m anaging expectations of the updating service 3) use of a formal agreement prior to service commencing; and 4) specific errors attributed to the updating OPEN ACCESS service; 5) additional planning in case of reviews that involve complex data extraction. These findings echoed findings outlined in the July 2011 report on the updating project. Recommendations: Any future centralised updating project should be designed with the findings of this and the July 2011 repor t in mind. Consideration of how much time authors can devote to updating work is fundamental. Alternative models of support should be considered, including methods of incentivising authors. It should be noted that this follow -up paper focused on the final goal of publishing the updated Cochrane Reviews. The Collabor ation may also wish to consider the value of the tasks completed by the updating service to the review, to editorial group/authors and to the Collaboration (particularly in view of growing interest in linked data approaches to creating and updating reviews ), as a separate goal to the publication of the updated review within a specific timeframe. \" RevMan development GREEN The CEU has four representatives on the RevMan Advisory Committee, including one of the co -convenors (Toby Lasserson). The next version of RevMan is scheduled for release by the end of 2014. The process to identify and prioritize changes to the software ha s generated in excess of 200 separate change requests. The IMS team and the co -convenors of the RAC have organized a series of face to face meetings to establish the most important and substantial changes. Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS) GREEN OPEN ACCESS To date 62% of CRGs have migrated to the live version of the CRS. These users have been surveyed to determine which support strategies have been effective in the rollout phase and which were less so. The TSCs from CRGs yet to convert have also been surveyed to ascertain the challenges they are facing and how we can best support them in the run up to the March 31st, 2013 conversion target date. Forty -three webinars have been conducted and recorded. Three new CRS User Support Team members were appointed in Dece mber - Anne Littlewood (Oral Health), Anna Noel Storr (Dementia & Cognitive Improvement) and Fergus Tai (Breast Cancer), joined Doug Salzwedel (Hype rtension). A CRS training workshop is scheduled to take place after the Anniversary Symposium in Oxford in M arch and proposals for further workshops and an oral session will be submitted for the Quebec colloquium. Metaxis Ltd have carried out bug -fixing during this implementation phase but have also continued to develop the program in response to suggestions fro m TSCs who are now using the software to deliver search results to authors and to maintain their specialized registers. Additional programming work has been carried out to ensure that Meerkat users are able to transfer their study -based registers into the CRS. Cochrane Collaboration's 20th Anniversary GREEN The CEU has held meetings with representatives from the BMJ and PLoS who have expressed interest in publishing material to ce lebrate 20 years of The Cochrane Collaboration. In addition, we are will publish a series of editorials within The Cochrane Library to highlight landmark reviews and the people behind them, plus other noteworthy iss ues such as methods development, capacity building and training, and the crucial role of technology within th e Collaboration. EMBASE RFP AMBER The Collaboration received several innovative applications to manage the Embase Searching Project. The assessment panel, comp rised of a senior editor from the Cochrane Editorial Unit, a representative from the TSC Executive, two co -convenors of the Cochrane Information OPEN ACCESS Retrieval Methods Group and a senior information specialist at the UK Cochrane Centre, unanimously selected a preferred provider. The contract has been awar ded to a consortium comprised of the Cochrane Dementia & Cognitive Improvement Group, Metaxis Ltd and the York Health Economics Consortium. Work on the project is due to start in mid- March, pending the finalisation of the contract. New Embase records will s tart feeding into CENTRAL as soon as the management and processing systems are set up. Preliminary investigations indicate th at the processing of the backlog will be ongoing until June. Metaxis plan to set up a web site for reporting project progress. Cochrane Publishing and Editorial Policy Manual GREEN The Cochrane Policy Manual is a resource that documents both organizational and publication -related policy and has been managed by the Cochrane Operations Unit (COU). The COU and the CEU recently deci ded to split the Cochrane Policy Manual into two separate manuals, one for organizational policy and one for publication and editorial policy. The COU will be responsible for the Cochrane Operatio ns Manual, and the CEU will be responsible for the Cochrane Publication and Editorial Policy Manual. The project has started and will span several months during which we will need to revise, update (in consultation with different groups), and complete the contents of the two manuals. Harriet MacLehose and Noemie Au bert Bonn, an intern working with the CEU, are developing the Cochrane Publication and Editorial Policy Manual. Jini Hetherington, COU, is leading on the Cochrane Operations Manual. Methods report N/A The Methods community (see mission statement at annex A ) with support from the Methods Co ordinator, Jackie Chandler, continues to be actively involved in methods innovation, development of guidance, and facilitation of training and peer support on behalf o f the Collaboration. There are two new Methods Executive members elected at the Auckland Colloquium: Isabelle Boutron (BMG) and Sally Hopewell (MR G) and three new editors to the editorship of Cochrane Methods : Isabelle Boutron (BMG), Jo McKenzie (SMG), and Vivian Welch (CC Equity MG) . OPEN ACCESS Sixteen registered Methods Groups continue collectively to produce a wide range of activities and outputs to advance the Coll aboration's secondary purpose of methods development and support its primary purpose to produce hig h quality systematic reviews, including, for example: exemplar prognosis reviews, establishment of diagnostic test accuracy reviews, extensions to the 'Risk of bias' table (e.g. cluster, crossover and non randomised designs), decision framework for inclusion of non -randomized designs, brief economic summaries, guidance for reviews of complex interventions and developments to the 'Summary of findings' tables. A review of the methods activities in Cochrane is being undertaken by the Methods coordinator to dev elop a 3 -5 year Methods Strategy, encompassing all aspects of Cochrane Methods. Key highlights of interest are: \u00a7 Six methodological development projects funded through the Methods Innovation Fund are progressing well. \u00a7 Contributing to discussions and policy development paper on processes and options for extensions beyond the standard review model to consider review enhancements and additional types of review leading towards focusing on how reviews of different types of evidence and research questions can be linked together to enhance the standard intervention review. This is part of an ongoing programme of work arising from the strategic review of Cochrane content by the Cochrane Editorial Unit. \u00a7 Handbook 'Minor Update' Version 5.2 to include the MECIR standards. Publication is expected in May / June 2013. \u00a7 Handbook 'Major Revision' Version 6 planned for publication in parallel with the release of RevMan 6 is expected in 2014. There has been some re -organization of chapte rs alongside the planning of new chapters to address topics such as complex interventions and (non -statistical) synthesis methods. \u00a7 The fourth annual issue of Cochrane Methods is in preparation. \u00a7 Plans to implement strategies to develop infrastructure funds to support individual Methods Groups are progressing. Centre support for Methods Groups (and vice versa) will be discussed with the Centre Directors Executive during the Mid- Year Meetings in March. \u00a7 Methods Training events : Recruitment for the 2013 Methods training event, entitled \"Comparing Multiple Interventions: indirect comparisons and network meta- analysis\", to be held on 18 th, 19th and 22nd March at the Said Business School in Oxford which is being led by the Comparing Multiple Interventions Methods G roup. We anticipate a proposal for the 2014 event focusing on statistical methods incorporating inclusion of non -randomized designs. OPEN ACCESS \u00b7 Quebec Colloquium : Early workshops call complete with 34 workshops accepted covering submissions from 14 of the 16 Methods Groups. The open call is underway. A one day satellite event for GRADEpro training and a one day Methods Symposium focusing on statistical issues are planned. \u00a7 The MECIR project and the ongoing implementation of standards . Currently developing a booklet format of standards integrated with common errors and good practice examples for dissemination to CRGs and authors. \u00b7 Review of the Cochrane Methodology Register . \u00b7 Producing a suite of nine articles in BMC Systematic Reviews to celebrate methods achievements for The Cochrane Collaboration 20th Anniversary Celebrations . Further information on these items can be found at Appendix A. Oversight Committee N/A The Oversight Commmittee has met once since the Auckland Colloquium. There have been no threats to editorial independence. Th e Oversight Committee has provided advice relating to the publishing contract and the priorities for The Cochrane Library . The Chair, Dr Richard Smith also organised a questionnaire of Oversi ght Committee members and found the priorites ranked as follows: OPEN ACCESS A fuller report on the results is included in Appendix 4 Monitoring and Registration support for CRGs and Fields GREEN The CEU has worked with Claire Allen at the COU to develop revised, provisional core functions for CRGs and a new monitoring form for the 2013 round. The monitoring form has been developed by the IMS team and was circulated in the week begin ning 18th February. The form differ s from its predecessor in several ways, but should provide very useful information for CRGs to monitor their own performance , to identify OPEN ACCESS CRGs that are experiencing difficulties , and also w ays in which CRGs can be better supported. F or the first time the form will invite feedback on the performance of the central units in providing support. Copy Editing and style guide N/A In December 2012, Wiley employed a new Copy Edit Support Manager, Elizabeth Royle. Harriet MacLehose and John Hilton from the CEU and Elizabeth have been working together to refine a proposed copy -editing work -plan that will clarify the copy -editing -relate d work that the CEU and Copy Edit Support will do over the coming year, and which team will be responsible for the different activities. We are s till finalizing the work- plan and will share with the ME's Executive for their feedback and contributions befor e signing- off. The proposed areas of work are outlined below, along with notes about progress to date. Copy- editing: planned areas of support and progress to date Area of work Progress to date (1) Implement the policy that all Cochrane Review Groups will submit all Cochrane Protocols and Reviews to CES or an in -house copy -editor before publication (by May 2012) Policy implemented and discussing plans for monitoring adherence and follow -up as needed. (2) Employ a Copy Edit Support Manager and set up management and administrative processes for the CES team Elizabeth Royle employed and most administrative processes set up. Plans for improved integration with Archie are to be discussed. Elizabeth manages the workflow of the Copy Edit Support team to meet publication timelines (with an average of 94 articles submitted for copy- editing each month). (3) Develop and implement an accreditation process for prospective in -house copy- editors and new CES copy- editors Accreditation process was set up in 2011/12, a nd we are developing the new accreditation copy -editing tests to allow this to be completed for existing provisional copy -editors and rolled - out to new candidates. (4) Update the Cochrane Style Guide and related website Feedback is being coll ated and style guide is partly moved to OPEN ACCESS periodically Drupal on Cochrane.org (for an html version). Membership of the working group need to be agreed and group reformed to revise style guide. (5) Develop and update copy -editing checklists; and develop a policy for thei r use Checklists in use, but work needed to evaluate them to inform possible policy changes. (6) Audit the work of copy -editors, and provide training and information -sharing opportunities for copy- editors Regular checking of CES copy -editors' work; traini ng provided to CES copy -editors as required. (7) Provide training and support for copy -editors Elizabeth Royle provides remote, one -to-one training and support to copy -editors, as required. Copy- editors' forum set up; more work planned. (8) Evaluate the copy -editing activities and report back to the Collaboration Regular meetings ongoing and reports prepared as needed. 4. Enhance global participation and relevance of The Cochrane Collaboration and The Cochrane Library Translations GREEN The work of the translations exchange continues to be one of the success stories for the Collaboration over the past 2 -3 years. The initial work has been to ensure that translated c ontent can be presented, alongsi de the appropriate version of the relevant review both on The Cochrane Library and the Cochrane Summaries site. In particular, it is noteworthy that it is now possible to browse the Cochrane summaries sit e in multiple languages, and this is very likey the main reason why our analytics recently demonstrated that France was the 4th common origin for people using the Summaries website (http://summaries.cochrane.org/fr) . It is now appropriate that the Collaboration is taking a more comprehensive approach to developing a translations strategy, led by Xavier Bonfill, and building o n the excellent work of the translations working group, led by Lorne Becker and Juliane R ied. OPEN ACCESS For the detailed translations report, prepared by Lorne Becker and Juliane R ied, see Appendix B at the end of this report Support for Evidence Aid GREEN The CEU has worked with the Evidence Aid team to maintain and keep updated the following Cochrane Library Special Collections: \u00b7 Cochrane Evidence Aid: resources for earthquakes \u00b7 Cochrane Aid: resources for burns \u00b7 Cochrane Eviden ce Aid: resources for flooding and poor water sanitation \u00b7 Cochrane Evidence Aid: resources fo r post -traumatic stress disorder following natural disasters The CEU has also worked with Claire and the Evidence Aid team to add extra reviews that have been prioritised by the International Rescue Committee (IRC) to the collections (for example 11 extra IRC- prioritised reviews were added to the Resources for Earthquakes Evidence Aid Special Collect ion in February). The CEU has also liaised with Wiley to ensure free access is granted for those reviews added to Evidence Aid Special Collections. WHO Nutrition group N/A The CEU has continued to support the development of guidelines related to nutrition. David Tovey is a member of the WHO guidelines development group - nutrition actions. Support for Global Network N/A OPEN ACCESS David Tovey has worked with Peter Tugwell, Jeremy Grimshaw and others to assist in the development of the plans for the Global Network, attending the Conference for Health Systems Evidence in Beijing. This work will now be led by Mark Wilson the Collaboration's Chief Executive Officer .

We also welcome three new editors to the editorship of Cochrane Methods : Isabelle Boutron (BMG), Jo McKenzie (SMG), and Vivian Welch (CC Equity MG) . We are very grateful to, and thank, Julian Higgins who has stepped down as edit or of Cochrane Methods . The Cochrane Methods community continues to be actively involved in methods innovation, development of guidance, and facilita tion of training and peer support on behalf of the Collaboration. The following key projects continue with further information below: \u00a7 The MECIR (Methodological Expectations of Cochrane Intervention Reviews) project previously produced a set of minimum standar ds for the conduct and reporting of reviews. Standards for updates and protocols are underway. We are developing a booklet of standards integrated with common errors and good practice examples for dissemination to CRGs and authors. \u00a7 The six methodological development projects funded through the Methods Innovation Fund have produced their second interim rep orts and are progressing well (no concerns are noted). \u00a7 A 'White paper' is in development for discussion at the Mid -Year meeting in March as part of an ongoing programme of work arising from the strategic review of Cochrane content by the Cochrane Editorial Unit. This discusses processes and options for extending beyon d the standard review model to consider review enhanceme nts and additional types of review. \u00a7 Contributors to the Handbook are in the process of updating their chapters for Version 5.2, the 'Minor Update'. There has been some delay in this and we now expect that Version 5.2 will be published in May -June. With re spect to Version 6, the 'Major Revision' planned for publication in OPEN ACCESS parallel with the release of RevMan 6 is expected in 2014. There has been some re- organization of chapters alongside the planning of new chapters to address topics such as complex interven tions and (non -statistical) synthesis methods. \u00a7 The fourth annual issue of Cochrane Methods is in preparation and will be published by the Quebec Colloquium, to include a detailed update of Cochrane methods activities and outputs. Three new editors have jo ined and this issue will be informed by findings from a survey of readers of the third annual issue in September 2012. \u00a7 Plans to implement strategies to develop infrastructure funds to support individual Methods Groups are progressing. Centre su pport for Me thods Groups (and vice versa) will be discussed with the Centre Directors Executive during the Mid -Year Meetings in March. \u00a7 Methods Training events: Recruitment for the 2013 Methods training event, entitled \"Comparing Multiple Interventions: indirec t compar isons and network meta -analysis\", to be held on 18th, 19th and 22nd March at the Said Business School in Oxford which is being led by the Comparing Multiple Interventions Methods Group is nearly at capacity with options for remote participation also provided. We anticipate a propos al for the 2014 event focusing on statist ical methods for inclusion of non -randomized designs. \u00a7 Quebec Colloquium: Early workshops call complete with 34 workshops accepted covering submissions from 14 of the 16 Methods Gr oups. The open call is underway. A one day satellite event for GRADEpro training and a one day Methods Symposium focusing on statistical issues are planned. \u00a7 Development of a Methods Strategy, encompassing all aspects of Cochrane Methods, is in development. \u00b7 Producing a suite of nine articles in BMC Systematic Reviews to celebrate methods achievements for The Cochrane Collaboration 20th Anniversary Celebrations.

Methods Groups Albeit with limited secure, direct funds to support the infrastructure of the large majority of individual Methods Groups, 16 registered Methods Groups continue collectively to produce a wide range of activities and outputs (including, but not limited to, all those described above in this document) to advance the Collaborat ion's secondary purpose of methods development and support its primary purpose to produce high quality systematic reviews, including, for example: exemplar prognosis reviews, establishment of diagnostic test OPEN ACCESS accuracy reviews, extensions to the 'Risk of bias' table (e.g. cluster, crossover and non - randomised designs), development of a decision framework for inclusion of non -randomized designs, brief economic summaries, guidance for reviews of complex interventions as well ongoing developments to the 'Summary of findings' tables. The following changes are reported: \u00b7 number of changes to convenors ( APSMG -Roberto D'Amico, Tianjing Li and Rebecca Armstrong have joined, QIMG - Margaret Cargo and Tomas Pantoja have joined, CC Equity MG - Vivian Welch has joined). Further information on Methods Groups activities will be reported in Cochrane Methods. Additional notes A. Handbook developments The current editorial team for the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions is Julian Higgins, Rachel Churchill, Jackie Chandler and Miranda Cumpston. Miranda is currently on maternity leave. Authors and Editors of all current chapters and new chapters have been identified and c ontacted with the proposed timescales for completing draft updates for Version 5.2. This update is currently behind schedule due to pressing workloads of the Handbook Editors and will be available May/June 2013. Many authors are already working on substant ive amendments and new chapters for Version 6 due in 2014 linked with the RevMan 6 launch. A further version will follow to take account of findings from the MIF projects (which are due to complete in late 2014 and early 2015). The MECIR Conduct standards have been incorporated into relevant chapters and the reporting standards will reside in a new chapter. B. Methodological Expectations in Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR) (responsibility of the Methods Application and Review Standards Working Group) http://www.editorial- unit.cochrane.org/mecir contains detailed information on this project. There are 80 conduct standards and 108 reporting standards. The MECIR project seeks to produce the following: 1. Methodological standards for the conduct of Cochrane intervention reviews a. Conduct standards for a new review - Completed b. Considerations for updated reviews - b 2. Standards for the reporting of Cochrane intervention reviews a. Reporting standards for a new review - Completed b. Reporting standards for abstracts - Completed c. Reporting standards for plain language summaries - to be finalised shortly d. Reporting standards for a new protocol - in process OPEN ACCESS e. Considerations for reporting upda ted reviews - in process 3. Examples of good practice in the methodological conduct of Cochrane intervention reviews 4. Examples of common errors in the methodological conduct of Cochrane intervention reviews. Items 3 and 4 are being collated and will be available electronically, but are also being pulled together with the standards in a 'booklet' format. For items 1b, 2d, 2e a meeting will occur on 12th March. C. Cochrane Methods Julian Higgins has stepped down as editor and Mike Clarke has indicated tha t he would also like to step down in the near future. We have engaged 3 new editors to work alongside JC and MC this year, and are grateful to Isabelle Boutron (BMG), Jo McKenzie (SMG) and Vivian Welch (CC Equity MG). JC has been collating material for the next publication. Editors will discuss content in early March. Consideration will be given to the inclusion of abstracts from relevant articles published in the BMC journal Systematic Reviews. Information from the readers' survey suggests that responders would like articles to undergo peer review, that it remains a valuable and important avenue for sharing research and ideas for development. Methods news, commentary on published articles and articles on methods development remain valuable. Three quarters o f responders would like feature length articles on a particular method e.g. evidence of need, importance, a detailed methods description, developments in progress, a focus on key developers and implications for implementation. D. BMC journal Systematic R eviews series of articles The purpose of the papers is to highlight the contribution The Cochrane Collaboration has made to the science of systematic reviews. These papers will be drawn together with an overview paper. There are four main theme papers highlighting methods central to Cochrane methodology e.g. statistics and bias. Additional papers include a personal perspective, from someone with a longstanding involvement in Cochrane methods, and papers illustrating the breadth of methodology developing within the Cochrane systematic review model e.g. economics and qualitative syntheses. The papers are planned for publication in August/September 2013. E. Methods Innovation Fund (MIF) (responsibility of the Methods Board, delegated to the Methods Applica tion and Review Standards Working Group) Interim reports from all six projects were received and reported to the MARS WG. Key progress steps are reported in brief below: 1. Searching for unpublished trials using trials registers and trials web sites and o btaining unpublished trial data and corresponding trial protocols from regulatory agencies : Search strategies have been drafted for CMR, MEDLINE and E MBASE , to create the annotated bibliography. These strategies are currently undergoing peer review. The volume of work is larger than expected and York University are subsidising this endeavour to a greater extent OPEN ACCESS than originally envisaged (in order to keep within budget limits no funding was requested for the searches and record selection stages of this project). This component of the project started late due to delays in drawing up the contract, however, it is expected to be completed within the project timescales. 2. Extending the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool to assess risk of bias in randomized trials with non-parallel- group designs, and non -randomized studies : Eight international working groups have been set up to address the five main bias domains, 'other biases' and non standard designs. There are 36 confirmed working group members to attend a key m eeting discussing signalling questions for the respective bias domains in Queens College Oxford for 21-22 March 2013. A survey of the CRGs to inform this project of the CRG's needs for tool development has been completed, results collated and circulated to the core group. No issues or concerns raised, deadline expected to be met. 3. Enhancing the acceptance and implementation of 'Summary of findings' tables in Cochrane Reviews: An extensive first report on the progress of this project against project object ives was received. These, in brief, were: Guidance for formatting of SoF tables : Development of user testing and randomized trials protocols, screening and assessment of SoF tables available in the Cochrane Collaboration, listing of the most important alt ernative format items to be tested and categorization according to the stage for testing, and creation of a database of potential participants. Guidance and standardization of footnotes for SoF tables : A first outline of the Footnotes project was presented at the GRADE Working Group meeting in January 2012 in Barcelona. A protocol has been developed. 'Summary of findings' table in diagnostic test accuracy Reviews The GRADE and DTA SoF workshops worked through practical examples of applying the GRADE approach to DTA systematic review data from the literature, preparing a draft SoF Table. An evaluation and feedback on the example SoF Tables was received. Subsequently in the last 6 months good progress has been made. However, testing of guidance for for matting SoF tables will be delayed because of additional background work that was required and because of a relatively poor response from Cochrane Entities. Strategies will improve through individual contact. 4. Methodological Investigation of Cochrane rev iews of Complex Interventions (MICCI) : A Complex intervention meeting hosted in Jan 2012 has developed a set of seven draft papers for the Journal of Clinical Epidemiology due for publication in the first half of 2013. A Draft study protocol for the furthe r development of the tool to classify complex interventions has been developed. A tool to describe dimensions of intervention complexity has been developed and will be piloted. Staffing changes: The project research officer left the project at the end of August and was replaced by Maggie Hendry thus extending the length of the project slightly to September 30 th 2014. 5. Addressing missing trial participant data in Cochrane systematic reviews : Design of the search strategy study 1 is complete. Study 2: Data has been collected from about 50 systematic reviews. A poster was presented at the Auckland Colloquium. A conceptual paper about addressing missing trial participant data in systematic reviews to serve as a OPEN ACCESS conceptual framework for the project has been drafted. A research assistant officially started work January 2013. 6. Methods for comparing multiple interventions in Intervention reviews and Overviews of reviews : A detailed guidance document (instead of a decision chart ) is being drafted to guide authors and editors into selecting the appropriate review format, and discusses other fundamental issues around reviews with multiple interventions. The document will be disseminated to the C ollaboration in February. F. Methods Training Events 2013: This event will be a three -day course divided into two parts to facilitate undertaking indirect comparisons and network meta -analysis in Cochrane reviews that aim to compare multiple interventions. Part I will be for a statistical audience and applicants have been required to provide evidence of their experience. Part II will be for a general audience (including editors), focusing on issues around conceptualizing, initiating, managing, and coordinating such reviews. This event will take place alongside the Mid Year Meeting in Oxford, UK on the 18 th, 19th, and 22nd March 2013. 2014: We are expecting an outline submission from the SMG in collaboration with the NRSMG and the BMG. G. Devel opment plans for infra structure funding for Methods Groups An initial paper outlining proposals to develop infrastructure funding for individual Methods Groups was approved by the CCSG in Madrid, 2011. Implementation of these proposals is ongoing. Provisi onally, priority has been assigned to developing a proposal for funded Cochrane Methods Fellowships, still in development. A discussion with Centre Directors regarding Centre support for individual Methods Groups (and vice versa) is scheduled during the CD s Executive Mid -Year meeting. The Canadian Cochrane Centre has recently shared the business plans that facilitated the allocation of infrastructure funds to support individual Methods Groups based in Canada as part of the overall funding allocation for the Centre. Ian Shemilt on behalf of the Methods Executive has kindly agreed to present to the CD meeting at the Mid Year Meeting in March to discuss the proposals further. H. Cochrane Methodology Register (CMR) After individual discussions with Andrew Booth, Mike Clarke, Julian Higgins and David Tovey, JC developed a discussion document for circulation to a range of experienced individuals with known interests in methodological bibliographic databases internal an d external to Cochrane. The purpose is to arrange a forum for discussion to: \u00b7 explore options for a revised format possibly with other partners, \u00b7 provide a clear rationale for the continuation of a systematic review methodology database that may look poten tially quite different, \u00b7 identify funds within and outside Cochrane as appropriate. This document has been circulated and a range of individuals have agreed to be involved with a view to taking part in a discussion forum hopefully April/May. OPEN ACCESS I. Extension of the standard Cochrane review model: enhancements and additional review types This has evolved out of work conducted for the Strategic session in 2012. A 'White paper' is being developed to crystallise Collaboration discussions of current and potential developments,, to incorporate qualitative, economic and process evaluation data for example, the inclusion of non -randomised designs for adverse effects and benefits or the development of new review types addressing different questions such as prognosis an d implementation of intervention. The development of this paper is leading towards focusing on how reviews of different types of evidence and research questions can be linked together to enhance the standard intervention review. This discussion paper will be discussed at the business meetings at the Mid Year meeting in March 2013. Challenges for this period are: For the Methods Co -ordinator general workload is a challenge particularly to complete projects and pick up new projects and progress other develop ments, particularly the website, in a timely fashion. This would be greatly improved by consistent administrative support that has not been feasible since coming into post for a range of reasons. It is hoped that this will improve in the foreseeable future . She will produce a revised job description to take into account developments since coming into post. Challenges remain for the individual Methods Groups as Most of them do not receive secure direct funding to support infrastructure. There have been a number of initiatives of late requiring considerable input from many of the Methods Groups, including contributing to the methodological standards programme (MECIR) and updating Handbook chapters. In the light of ongoing methodological developments and exp ectations within the Collaboration (e.g. planned mandating of SoFs, inclusion of NRS for harms, comparing multiple interventions and network meta -analysis and the incorporation of qualitative and economic data into reviews) there is likely to be increasing pressure on Methods Groups to provide peer review and direct methodological input into reviews, possibly as members of review teams. Currently MGs seem very able to recruit new convenors highlighting the enthusiasm for methodological development. 3. FUND ING AND/OR POLICY DECISION REQUESTS None at present. OPEN ACCESS Appendix 2 : Translations report From: Lorne Becker, Convenor of the Cochrane Translation Working Group To: The Cochrane Collaboration Steering Group Date: 22 February 2013 Re: Translation Working Group progress report to the Steering Group for its meeting in Oxford, 17 and 21 March 2013 1. BACKGROUND The Cochrane Translation Working Group was set up by Lorne on David Tovey's request after the Split Mid -year Meetings because of the increasing need for coordination of various Cochrane translation initiatives. The working group is constituted of represent atives of the groups from different territories and Cochrane Centres providing translations, plus those responsible for the technical implementation, including programmers based at the IMS, the Web Team and Wiley -Blackwell. The group has mainly been workin g on supporting on -going translation projects of Cochrane abstracts and PLSs, on improving work flows and infrastructure for managing and publishing these translations, and serving as a point of contact for people involved or interested in translations. We are in regular contact or early stage discussion with groups from France, Spain, Japan, China, Taiwan, Brazil, Croatia, Israel, Turkey, and Indonesia. Translation strategy and its implementation have been identified as one of the components of the Cochr ane Content project (under Workstream 3: Dissemination and Impact) after the Paris Strategic Session on Cochrane content (April 2012), and one of the 'highlights' of the new Publishing Arrangement with Wiley constitutes a multi- lingual content plan. Translations have also recently become a focus of the Linked Data project, as there is a lot of potential for flexible and efficient solutions for translation management if developed within a linked data framework. 2. PROGRESS SINCE AUCKLAND AND ON -GOING AC TIVITIES TRANSLATION EXCHANGE IN ARCHIE The IMS has completed the development of the Translation Exchange in Archie in September 2012, and the French Cochrane Centre has been using it since. Nonetheless, we continue to work on improvements to better support translating groups. The Translation Exchange allows translating groups to download and upload translation documents which are generated based on, and linked to, the English review. It enables them to access, manage and publish their translations themselves, so they don't need to contact the IMS or Wiley every time they want to translate specific reviews, or publish certain translations. Once a translation is marked for publication, it is published automatically on The Cochrane Library and Cochrane Summaries with the next issue. Translation do cuments OPEN ACCESS currently include the abstract and PLS only, but could be extended if required by a translating group. Translation documents of new and updated reviews are available from the submission closing date, i.e. there is some leeway for translating grou ps to prioritise new and updated reviews of particular interest and complete the translations in time for simultaneous publication with the English Review. The Translation Exchange is designed to support versioning of translation documents so that they are always linked to the corresponding review version. This allows identifying outdated translations, so they can be marked accordingly on our websites, and updated as soon as possible. Keeping translations up to date is actually one of the biggest challenges for the French translation project. Around 100 reviews are republished with amendments or updates every month. A portion of these is amended or updated while they are still being translated. Managing this is very time and cost intensive, and this is certainly an area, where we should work on improving our system to better support this endeavour. We are currently working on adding an online editing tool which we hope will be one measure to facilitate the updating process a little better. All translating g roups are encouraged to use the Translation Exchange going forward; however, those working on smaller projects are usually reluctant to do so, as they see limited benefit in automating their processes, if they have to invest some time in learning how to us e the Exchange and adapt to using our translation file format. Although, the Spanish team is keen to use it, they cannot change their processes at the moment, as their publisher Update Software isn't able to accommodate our file format. MEs can view (but not edit) the translations of their reviews in their Review Group's folder. PUBLICATION ON THE COCHRANE LIBRARY AND COCHRANE SUMMARIES - TRANSLATED WEB INTERF ACE, SEARCH AND BROWSE On Cochrane Summaries , French, Spanish and Simplified Chinese language port als have been published, including translated web interface, search function, browse by Review Group and publication date, and for French and Spanish also the CEU We are planning to work with the different teams to further improve the portals to their users' needs, keeping in mind the main audience of Cochrane Summaries. The Simplified Chinese portal constitutes a pilot project allowing us to collect usage data which might make a case for the conduct of a comprehensive translation project in Simplified Chinese. Unfortunately, w e encountered a problem related to searching in Chinese characters, which requires the Web Team to prog ramme an update to the search function for this to work properly. As part of the new Publishing Arrangement, Wiley aims at implementing a multi- lingual content plan which includes \"implementing search support for multiple languages, which will enable users to search The Cochrane Library in the official languages of the World Health Organization (and other languages as agreed) and have the titles of all relevant Cochrane Reviews returned to them in the translated language via a user interface that has also been OPEN ACCESS translated\" . There are, howe ver, no firm specifications and dates available for the implementation of these developments yet. PUBLICATION STATUS COCHRANE SUMMARIES (AS OF ISSUE 1, 2013): - French: 2464 abstracts and PLSs; around 370 (new and updates) are to be published in Issue 2, 2013, and 700 more are in progress. Access to Cochrane Summaries by French -speaking users has almost tripled from September 2012 to January 2013 without any promotion from our side, and France is now ranking 4th after the USA, UK and Canada in the access by country statistics. - Spanish: 4,767 abstracts and PLSs; retrieved from the Biblioteca Cochrane Plus , i.e. not stored in Archie format; around 1,200 marked as outdated. - Simplified Chinese: 100 ab stracts and PLSs; converted to Archie format by Wiley. - Traditional Chinese: 3,524 abstracts and PLSs; retrieved from Wiley, currently on the test site only, and not stored in Archie format. - German: 634 PLSs; not stored in Archie format; all marked as outdated. T HE COCHRANE LIBRARY (AS OF ISSUE 1, 2013): - French: in theory around 2300 abstracts and PLSs retrieved from Archie, but it is currently impossible to search for French translations on The Cochrane Library and to verify this number. - Spanish: 659 (in W ileyML, not in Archie format). - Traditional Chinese: 3,541 abstracts and PLSs (in WileyML, not Archie format). - Simplified Chinese: 98 abstracts and PLSs (converted to Archie format by Wiley). - Japanese: 10 abstracts (converted to Archie format by Wiley). Wiley is willing to fund the conversion of the remainder of the Japanese translations (ca. 1,400 abstracts) into our translation file format to allow for smooth publication on The Cochrane Library and Cochrane Summaries . COCHRANE POLICY MANUAL We have disc ussed revisions to the section on translations within the Cochrane Policy Manual (2.2.10.1) with David Tovey, Harriet MacLehose and Ruth Foxlee. We are planning to prepare a draft suggestion for an amended version in the next months, which will then be brought to the Steering Group for approval. 3. 5-YEAR STRATEGIC PLAN Xavier Bonfill has agreed to take the lead in developing a proposal for a 5 -year strategic plan for translations on behalf of the Centre Directors Executive with contributions and input from around 15 people with various language backgrounds. The proposal has been submitted for consideration by the Steering Group at its Oxford meeting. Juliane Ried supported the initiative as a Project Officer (1 day per week). 4. STATUS OF TRANSLATION INITIATIVES IN VARIO US LANGUAGES SPANISH OPEN ACCESS Spanish translations of the majority of existing reviews (abstract, PLS, and specific sections of the review) are published on the Biblioteca Cochrane Plus . Most of these abstracts and PLSs are also published on Cochrane Summaries and in part on The Cochrane Library (see section 2./Publication status for figures). The Spanish translation project has been resumed in November, after a forced break of about 1 year due to funding problems. They have now continued to translate new and updated abstrac ts and PLSs, while working on catching up with the new and updated reviews of the previous year. They are not using the Translation Exchange, and the new translations are only published on the Biblioteca Cochrane Plus so far, because of file compatibility issues. FRENCH The French Cochrane Centre is undertaking a comprehensive project translating abstracts and PLSs of all new and updated reviews every month, as well as the legacy reviews. Funding is provided by the Canadian Institute of Research Health, th ree Quebec government institutes and the French Ministry of Health. They are working with two professional translation agencies which do the translations, and in a second step have the completed translations reviewed by French -speaking content and methodol ogy experts (many of which are part of the respective Review Groups). New and updated reviews have been translated since October 2011. For the legacy data, they have prioritised specific Review Groups which are of particular interest to their funders and cooperating Review Groups. They are planning to complete 3500 translations by September 2013, after which they are unclear about the availability of additional funding. Jacob Riis and Juliane Ried had several calls and webinars with Ahmed Mowafak and Elise Diard from the French translation team, to solve issues and answer questions related to them using the Translation Exchange. TRADITIONAL CHINESE Wiley has received 40 new translated abstracts and plain language summaries in Traditional Chinese from the Taiwanese team who had previously completed around 3600 translations. Another 150 translations are planned for, to be finished by the end of November 2013. We are in touch with them about using the Translation Exchange going forward. CROATIAN The Croatian Branch of the Italian Cochrane Centre has received funding to translate 50 Plain Language Summaries into Croatian, a language which is widely understood in former Yugoslavia. The reviews are being selected in consultation with patient associations and on basis of the top 50 downloaded reviews and the top 50 accessed on Cochrane Summaries. They will be translated manually by two staff members of the Branch. The translations are due to be finished by 20 April 2013 in time for the annual Croatian Cochrane Sym posium, where the translated PLSs will be promoted. Juliane Ried held a Translation Exchange training session with the Croatian team, and they are ready to use it for their project. We have encouraged them to also translate the interface of the Cochrane Su mmaries site, so we can publish the completed translations there. SIMPLIFIED CHINESE OPEN ACCESS A pilot project has been completed exploring automatic conversion of Cochrane abstracts from Traditional Chinese characters (as available from the Taiwan team) to Simplified Chinese characters. The project report is available upon request. See above for details on the publication status. JAPANESE A group in Japan has completed around 1,400 translations for reviews that have been selected because of their relevance to Japane se guidelines, and will continue to translate selected reviews using the same criteria. Wiley is willing to provide funding to convert these into our new XML format, but the publication is pending a license agreement with the translation funder MINDS (Japan Medical Information Network Distribution Service). We are also working with the Japanese to integrate future translations in the Translation Exchange. Discussions had taken place in Auckland, but there hasn't been any progress since. PORTUGUESE Brazilian Cochrane Centre staff has been translating selected reviews of interest to the Portuguese speaking world for some time, around 10 translations per month. HEBREW Sara Yaron, a Consumer advocate based in Israel and CCNet member, is planning to translate reviews on breast cancer topics into Hebrew. Yuval Arbitman of Karkur College in Israel has requested permission to translate reviews in the area of complementary medicine into Hebrew. . INDONESIAN Detty Nurdiati, based in Yogyakarta and a revie w author of the Pregnancy and Childbirth Group, is planning to translate reviews on pregnancy and childbirth topics into Indonesian. TURKISH We have received a request from Dr Kemal Tuskan from the Istanbul ENT & Head -Neck Surgeons Association who would l ike to translate Cochrane abstracts of his specialty into Turkish. GERMAN The German Cochrane Centre translated around 700 PLSs in 2007, however there have not been any resources available since to update these or to continue the project. OPEN ACCESS Appendix 3 : Updating project evaluation Follow- up of centralised updating pilot project: Focus on the numbers of updates published Summary description: This report describes the findings of semi- structured interviews with six Cochrane Review Groups (CRGs) carried o ut between December 2012 and February 2013 to follow up on the centralised updating pilot project conducted in 2010/11. An update on the publication status of reviews as of January 2013 was sought, and participants were asked to identify any continuing bar riers to publication following centralised updating support. They were also asked to reflect on the successes/weaknesses of the centralised updating model or to suggest alternative updating forms of assistance, bearing in mind the final goal of increasing the number of updates published. Results: Six interviews were conducted with editorial base staff - four current Managing Editors (ME), one former ME, and one Coordinating Editor. One ME communicated by email only. Four of the 14 review updates included in the centralised updating pilot project have been published as of January 2013; one is due for publication in Issue 2, 2013, and remainder are with the author or the editorial group. Participants identified issues that can be grouped into five major them es: 1) the selection of appropriate reviews; 2) communication and managing expectations of the updating service 3) use of a formal agreement prior to service commencing; and 4) specific errors attributed to the updating service; 5) additional planning in c ase of reviews that involve complex data extraction. These findings echoed findings outlined in the July 2011 report on the updating project. Recommendations: Any future centralised updating project should be designed with the findings of this and the July 2011 report in mind. Consideration of how much time authors can devote to updating work is fundamental. Alternative models of support should be considered, including methods of incentivising authors. It should be noted that this follow -up paper focu sed on the final goal of publishing the updated Cochrane Reviews. The Collaboration may also wish to consider the value of the tasks completed by the updating service to the review, to editorial group/authors and to the Collaboration (particularly in view of growing interest in linked data approaches to creating and updating reviews), as a separate goal to the publication of the updated review within a specific timeframe. Purpose This was a follow -up assessment of the centralised updating pilot project (2010/2011) with the six CRGs involved. The aims are to (1) ascertain the current status of the reviews involved in the project, i.e. whether/when the update was published and any bar rier to OPEN ACCESS publishing the update following updating support; (2) discuss any lessons learned from the project, or suggested modifications to the centralised updating model used, bearing in mind the final goal of increasing the number of updates published; (3) discuss participant ideas about alternative updating assistance, bearing in mind the final goal of increasing the number of updates published in a timely and efficient manner. Background The original centralised updating pilot project was run in 2010/2011, as one part of a year- long project funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR). This project also separately looked at prioritising Cochrane Review updates - see the full report for details. [Full report: National Institute for Health Research Cochrane -National Health Service Engagement Award Scheme; Fit for purpose: centralised updating support for high- priority Cochrane Review; July 2011] The centralised updating pilot project aimed to provide short and focused periods of assistance by an updating team, to incentivise authors, and to address barriers to updating. This approach was designed to keep the final responsibility for updating with the authors, and the CRGs. The centralised updating team aimed to provide specific updati ng support in pre-defined areas, following discussion with CRGs/authors and within the updating team (for list of tasks, see Appendix 1). The pilot included 14 Cochrane Review updates from six CRGs (Cochrane and Cochrane Airways Group). The Cochrane Reviews put forward for updating were identified by each CRG's own prioritisation processes. Most of the updating tasks were performed between November 2010 and April 2011. The mean time spent by the updating team on each update was 35.5 hours (median 26.71 hours, range 4.5 to 109.75 hours). The centralised updating service, identified efficiencies for upd ating Cochrane Reviews, and suggested improvements in the structure and processes for a potential centralised updating service. The final report estimated a cost of \u00a3400,000 for updating an additional 20% of Cochrane reviews if a centralised updating model was adopted across The Cochrane Collaboration. Feedback following the centralised updating pilot project in 2011, from both authors and CRGs, was very positive. All authors and MEs who responded to the question on rolling out an updating service for The Cochrane Collaboration were in favour. However, there were concerns in October, 2011 that none of the 14 review updates involved in the project had been published. [DT presentation, AHRQ 2012 annual conference] Methods On December 12, 2012 an email was sent to the MEs of each of the six Cochrane review groups involved in the centralised updating project, outlining the purpose of the follow -up project and inviting them to attend a short interview. Semi -structured interviews were conducted by one CEU edito r, by phone or face -face meetings (see Appendix 2). Participants OPEN ACCESS were encouraged to discuss any other aspects of the updating project or updating in general. Notes were made during each discussion, and where necessary followed up by email for clarification . Results All CRGs responded to the invitation email. Six interviews were conducted, representing five CRGs (four interviews with current MEs of four groups, and one additional interview with a former ME, and one conversation with a Co -Ed). One ME commun icated by email only. S TATUS OF THE COCHRANE REVIEWS IN JANUARY 2013: By January 2013, a total of four out of 14 reviews from the centralised updating pilot project have been published. Of the remaining 10 reviews: one is due for publication in Issue 2, 2013 (February), two are with the editorial group for sign -off/approval, two are either at or waiting for copy -edit, four are still with authors, and one has been split into four reviews, which are in the process of being written. The main delay to publis hing the update was described as author delay, resulting from author workload issues, change in authoring arrangement, or author commitment following updating support (9/14 reviews). Problems with the data extraction conducted by the updating service were identified as the source of delay for one review, which has been published. Problems discovered at editorial sign -off (error, omissions and style issues) and attributed to the updating service, were identified as contributing to delay with one review. No information was obtained about delays to publication in the cases of three reviews (one of which was published in Issue 8, 2012). The status of the reviews and summary notes about barriers to publication where identified by the participants of the follow -up, are described in Appendix 3. LESSONS LEARNED /RECOMMENDED CHANGES T O THE CENTRALISED UP DATING PILOT : The participants described \"lessons learned\" following their experience with the centralised updating pilot under broadly similar themes. These included the importance of selecting appropriate reviews for updating; communication, managing expectations of updating service and use of a formal agreement prior to updating service; and specific errors attributed to the updating service. One participant discuss ed the need for additional planning in case of reviews that involve complex data extraction. \u00b7 Importance of selection of appropriate reviews for updating : Three participants commented on this. -The review chosen for update should be big enough to necessit ate assistance, but not so big that an update within the scope of the updating service will be practical. There may be generic selection criteria across reviews, and the ongoing work on prioritisation for updates may help inform this. CRGs may also have own specific criteria, and knowledge of suitable reviews. - -Consider potential for bottle- necks later in process when selecting which reviews to be updated by centralised updating service. For example, it may be easier for a centralised updating service to OPEN ACCESS update a number of similar or related topic reviews at the same time. However, often these reviews will involve some of the same authors, editors and/or external reviewers, and so this may create a \"bottle- neck\" later in the process, which will delay completion to publication. -The reviews selected by the group for this pilot were particularly problematic reviews, either due to authors not engaged, or other difficulties, such as lack of time by author to update, or issues within reviews, so need to consider that selection for pilot not representative of reviews for update (is a select group) \u00b7 Importance of communication and managing expectations of updating service: Four participants commented on this. -Generally, early communication between the updating service and the group is necessary. Potentially include a planning step, and securing agreement on who does what. There should be clear expectations about what the updating service, editorial team, and authors will do from the outset of the process. - Happy with how the communication was handled during the pilot - i.e. communication directly between the updating service and author. However, acknowledges that this experience may differ from other groups because the lead author of the review, works in the department 2 days/week. - Feeling that delays largely as a result of a mismatch in expectations by the authors regarding the amount of work they needed to do on the update following the centralised updating support provided. For example one author anticipated that her role would involve a simpler manuscript check and sign- off, akin to a peer review process. Authors largely didn't realise the time commitment that updating the review would involve, which led to problems with authors being overcommitted and not having allocated sufficient time to work on the review once the centralised updating service had \"done their bit\". Managing author expectations may be tough but early communication may help. There may also be a need to agree a time- commitment and time -schedule with the authors in advance. Meeting at outset of process - planning meeting is important. Also, proactive monitoring of the review when it is at the author stage is important. Email communication tends not to work so well, and recommends agreed regular (e.g. weekly) meetings (phone/face- face). - The final product returned to the CRG was not to ME expectation (expected that it would be returned in a form which was ready to publish). However, expectations were very high, as this was a project run by the CEU, and so \"bar was high\". Difficult, but better engagement by updating service with how the review group work may be needed. Also felt that there were perhaps too many people involved in each update, and that it would have benefited from one person taking ownership and overseeing it, and read through review for consistency before returning to group. \u00b7 Need for a formal contract between the authors/editorial group/updating service prior to engagement of an updating team : Four participants commented on this: 1 participant supported a formal contract between the authors/editorial group/updating service prior to engagement of an updating team; 2 participants supported communication and structured follow -up/commitment, but did not a formal contract; 1 participant did not support imposing any commitments. - the service is limited by the willingness of the author to get on with the review once the data has been extracted and entered. In theory it's a great idea, but I wonder if the author needs to sign up to some sort of contract at the outset. - Need to get a firm commitment re time- frame and a time schedule to work on the update by the authors upfront, if centralised updating support is to be provided. Ideally such a time- schedule OPEN ACCESS should be driven by the authors, and it needs to be realistic given their other commitments/timetables. -Communication between Updating service/CRG/Author, to ensure that all are aware that specific funding has been set aside for this, and the process involved. Arrangements should also be made for follow -up, and authors aware that the status of the review will be followed up and expectation of publication. Not supportive of formal contract however. - Recommend against imposition of commitments either on CRG group or on authors. Many of the authors are volunteers, and wary about changing the dynamic of the relationship by imposing commitments/agreements. Also, re commitments from the CRG, feels that the editorial team currently do a lot of work on behalf of the authors. If the CRG had an external commitment with a centralised updating service, fears that this pressure may increase, if for some reason the authors were slow/unable to complete update. \u00b7 Specific errors with updating service: Two participants commented on this. -Difficulties/mistakes with parts of the data extraction carried out by the updating service, which were probably due to a lack of experience with the subject area and particular review methods (generic inverse variance data). These issues necessitated re- checking and correction of the data extraction originally performed by the service, and some back and forth between authors/editorial/updating service to finalise. Problems were not insurmountable, as the review has been published. However it resulted in so me delay and increase in the amount of work all - round - - The problems below were identified in one review where the updating service added risk of bias to the review [new studies and existing studies], and four new studies to the review. ME stated that th ese problems necessitated ~four days work by in- house systematic reviewer prior to publication: One case where the wrong study was described in the RoB table (wrong number of participants). The RoB line in the text was very brief, and summary not adequate/at level group would accept. Although four new studies were added to the text and tables, and risk of bias added to the review, group felt that these weren't really taken into account in review conclusions, discussion, and implications for practice were not revisited. Although the number of trials in the review was amended, the number of people wasn't. Style issues such as use of term \"patients\" instead of \"people\", as in rest of review; New sections did not reflect the order of outcomes listed as for the rest of the review, and graph numbering was random rather than consecutive. Use of \"significant difference\" rather than \"statistically significant difference\". \u00b7 Additional planning in case of reviews that involve complex data extraction: One participant commented on this. -Inclusion of generic inverse variance data should not preclude a review from a centralised updating/data extraction model if otherwise suitable. However, the data extraction/updating needs to be planned/discussed in advance, and any training need for dealing with these types of data in the person extracting the data should be identified. This should help with extracting data in the correct format - CONSIDERING A POTENTIAL FUTURE UPDATING SERVICE OPEN ACCESS Four participants supported the principle that the Collaboration invests in an Updating Service (2 answered \"yes\" outright and 2 answered \"yes\" with caveats). One participant was unsure. One participant communicating via email did not consider this question; - Yes, however need to work out detai ls to ensure workable and efficient ; - Yes, but would want publishable review delivered (without requiring extra work at group level) at the end of the process -; - Question too general, without focussing on the specifics of the process ; In theory it may be a good idea. However, consider that there are several specific problems which contribute to the difficulty in updating reviews. A centralised updating service may help with some of these problems but not with others, and so may help with updating some reviews, but not with others .) I IDEAS/OPINIONS ON ALTERNATIVE UPDATING SERVICES A number of ideas were suggested by participants during the interviews. Where one idea was suggested, future participants were asked to consider this as well. For this reason, not all participants were asked about all these options, and as such the number of comments under each option differs. The ideas suggested included: 1. An updating support service where one person is geographically close to the editorial base or sha red between groups who are located near each other. The updating support service person can then provide updating support to those groups, and spend time at the editorial bases in person as necessary; 2. Short -term paid fellowships awarded by the Collaboration to updating support person within group or to the authors allowing them time to complete an update within the group; 3. Use of tools, for example Distiller, for assisting with data extraction/updating, with support from a centralised updating service on h ow to use such software; 4. 'Pared down version' of updating service but with more communication between the service and the author outside of the CRG; 5. Use of on incentive scheme, similar to that currently offered by the NIHR. (1) An updating support service s ituated close to the editorial base/shared between groups who are located near each other - five participants commented on this. - An updating service where the person involved sits geographically close, either to the editorial base, or to the authors may be helpful. - An external person who can visit the CRG for a period of time to help with updating (set amount of time). Note this CRG already has an \"in- house reviewer\". This person works on reviews and updates, and CRG finds this helpful. - May be a good idea, and may be cost effective, dependant on arrangements. However, arrangement will need to consider that groups may be quite different in how they OPEN ACCESS work, and how they conduct reviews, regardless of difference in subject area. It may be difficult for one perso n to work across multiple groups for this reason. - Might work better, as would get to know groups. Emphasis on trying to minimise the number of people involved in updating as compared with the piloted centralised updating project. - More use of centres advoc ated; Updating person could sit within centres, and provide support for updating in terms of search/data extraction and also writing support where English is not first language of authors. (2) Short -term paid fellowships to updating support person/authors to complete an update at group level - 2 participants commented on this. - One CRG currently offers fellowships to some authors, who during the paid fellowship (e.g. from 1 -2 weeks to several months, e.g. depending on size of update/new review) have dedicated time to work on review/update, within the department. This model, alongside an updating service may be a practical step to ensure dedicated time/resource available to complete the update to publication. - Consideration of idea of visiting person to spend time (e.g. 3 weeks) within the group to work on an update may be good idea, but feeling that anything less than 8 weeks would not be sufficient, and so economically may not be feasible. (3) Encourage use of tools for example Distiller for assisting with data extraction/updating, with support from a centralised updating service on how to use such software - 1 participant commented on this. (4) Centralised updating service but with less input than provided by the service, but more engagement with the author, outside of the CRG - 1 participant commented on this. - Updating may involve only adding RoB of new/existing studies and data extraction into RevMan, with the expectation that author puts these in the review text. Give ownership of this to the author. Updating servi ce to engage directly with the author, although with advice from CRG editorial base, as they know authors . (5) Use of on incentive scheme (e.g. NIHR) - 1 participant commented on this. - Wouldn't work that well with this group, as only get the money when update is delivered. Also doesn't have a systematic reviewer available \"on tap\", as some other groups might. Would need to recruit somebody, so really would need money up- front, rather than afterwards. OTHER PRACTICAL STEPS FOR FUTURE SERVICE RECOMMENDATIONS The participants emphasised many of the same issues that were identified in the 2011 centralised updating pilot report, including the importance of securing a commitment from authors upfront and maintaining clear lines of communication. One participant OPEN ACCESS recomm ended that the centralised updating service would need to engage in proactive monitoring once the review is with the authors to ensure that the update progresses. One participant mentioned the potential for using the McMaster plus service to help with prioritisation/selection of reviews for updating. OPEN ACCESS Discussion Many of the \"lessons learned\" or changes suggested to the centralised updating service that were identified during these follow -up discussions, had been previously noted during the original updatin g project and included in the July 2011 report. For example, considering the issue of communication and managing expectations of updating service that was raised, the original report (July 2011) reported that: -\"In the initial consultation with the CRGs, we discussed the time the updating service could commit, timeframes for the updates, and the aim of the project. However, some CRGs had an expectation that the updating service could work on all parts of Cochrane Reviews until publication. More clarity was needed from the updating service at the beginning and throughout the process about what the updating service aimed to offer\". During follow -up discussions, one participant stated that they expected the updating service to return them a review which was \"ready to publish\", while another participant commented that further follow -up by the updating service until the update was published would be desirable. Managing/matching expectations would be an important and ongoing challenge if another updating pilot w as conducted. The issue of author commitment and workload featured strongly in the follow -up discussions and had also been identified in the July 2011 report, which concluded that \"limited assistance given to committed authors can improve motivation and increase the speed of the updating process; however, assistance may not improve motivation or increase the speed of updating for authors who are not able to commit any time\". The issue of author workload and how best to manage delays due to author workload , and/or changes in author availability or arrangement, during an update process, requires careful consideration. The level of support for the notion that the Collaboration should invest in a centralised updating service remained strong (with 4/6 groups supporting this; one unsure and one non - responder). The costs of a centralised updating service aiming to update an additional 20% of Cochrane Reviews every two years, was estimated at \u00a3400,000 per annum. [Final report] However, this calculation assumed 30 hours of assistance from an updating service per update (actual mean 35.5 hours), and importantly did not consider the delays in publication. The costs for comparison of alternative strategies - for example an updating support person who sits geographically close to editorial bases or paid fellowships to authors/updating person would need to be further assessed. Considering the alternative strategy of implementing an incentive scheme similar to the NIHR scheme, the cost per review is likely to be higher than for the centralised updating service (e.g. \u00a35000 awarded on completion of the update). The total cost of an incentive scheme would depend on how many Cochrane Reviews are eligible for the scheme, successful in the first application stage, and then successfully updated and published. Because the award is given after completion of the update, it benefits from certainty about publication of the update. However, it may be limited by the number of awards that can be made - the current NIHR scheme gives ~20 awards per year, at a cost of OPEN ACCESS ~\u00a3100,000. There is also a risk that being unsuccessful in the initial application step may de - incentivise an update. One participant expressed a concern about the practicality of this scheme for that group - As I don't have a systematic reviewer available \"on tap\", I would need to recruit somebody, and so would need money up- front, rather than afterwards. It should be noted that this follow -up paper focused on the final goal of publishing the updated Cochrane Reviews. As such, it has not considered the value added by collecting relevant data to completing the update by the updating service pilot. The value of the tasks completed by the updating service could be regarded as separate goals to the publication of the updated review. We do not know whether identifying relevant studies, study appraisal and collection of relevant data have added value, irrespective of the current publication status of the updated reviews. The positive perception of the pilot by the CRGs may in part be attributable to the value they place on targeting these processes, despite the low rate of published updated reviews almost two years after completion of the updating pilot. In view of the growing interest in linked data approaches to creating and updating reviews within the collaboration, the usefulness of these data may yet become fully apparent if they can be used in other reviews or network meta -analyses. A more comprehensive analysis of the impact of the updating s ervice pilot project, considering the value of the collected data to the review, to editorial group/authors and to the Collaboration, may be merited. Conclusions As of January 2013, four of the 14 Cochrane review updates, involved in the centralised updat ing pilot project, have been published. The remainder are with the editorial bases or with the authors. The pilot project was small, with some groups having experience with only one review, and thus commenting on the limits of their experience. The major d elay to publication was delay at author level, due to author workload issues, change in authoring arrangement, or author commitment (9 of 14 reviews). Support for the Collaboration investing in a centralised updating service remained high in this small group, however, participants were concerned about the practical challenges of delivering a service across CRGs when editorial processes vary and the time pressures effecting authors are outside the Collaboration's control. Future centralised updating prop osals should consider the geographical proximity of the service to the groups using it; the possibility of creating short -term paid fellowships to facilitate updating; the potential for information technologies to efficiencies in the updating process and t he desirability of members of the centralised updating team to communicate directly with review authors. An alternative incentive scheme, similar to that offered by the NIHR may also be considered. Any proposal should be fully costed. A rethinking of what OPEN ACCESS defines the success of a centralised updating project (e.g. updates published within a certain timeframe, or value added by tasks completed) might also be warranted.

OPEN ACCESS Appendix 4: Oversight Committee survey OPEN ACCESS OPEN ACCESS The Cochrane Collaboration's Strategic Plan ning Framework Document prepared by: Mark Wilson, CEO, The Cochrane Collaboration Submitted to : The Steering Group meeting on 17th March and the Collaboration's Mid- Year Meeting Strategic Session on 20th March 2013 Purpose: To map and then analyse The Cochrane Collaboration's existing strategic framework, propose potential changes, and recommend the appropriate strategic planning exercise for the Collaboration to begin in 2013 - including the focus of t he strategic planning session at the mid -year business meetings in Oxford in March . Urgency: High . Access: This is an open access paper. Background: 1. One of the CCSG's strategic priority tasks in 2012- 13 was to complete a new five -year strategy for the Collaboration. This work was not able to begin, however, because of the interim nature of 2012 with an Acting CEO in position until late in the year and the senior leadership's focus on negotiating the future publishing contract. A decision was taken to await the arrival of the new CEO in November 2012; and following the final agreement and signing of the new publishing contract with Wiley in late January 2013 it was only in February that I was able to turn to the strategic planning project in order to make best use of the session on strategic planning at the Collaboration's mid -year meetings in Oxford in March. 2. This document is therefore a relatively b rief assessment of the Collaboration's existing strategic framework and some initial ideas on how it might be developed, refocused and improved. The goal has been to set out a pragmatic strategic planning process for 2013 that builds on the on- going work a round the 2008 - 09 'Strategic Review' recommendations and focuses on the most important areas of change I believe are needed. 3. This document is not intended to be a comprehensive analysis at every level of the Collaboration's strategic positioning and future priorities and development. Proposals and Discussion: Mapping the Collaboration's existing strategic framework 3. The essential first task in a strategic planning exercise is to analyse what strategic framework is already in place for t he Collaboration and determine how much of the existing strategic objectives and plans sit well within it as a useful guide to action and priority setting. The table below is therefore an attempt to map the existing strategic framework that The Cochrane Col laboration already has in place: OPEN ACCESS The Cochrane Collaboration's existing s trategic framework Vision Our vision is that healthcare decision -making throughout the world will be informed by high -quality, timely research evidence. Mission The Cochrane Collaboration is an international organisation that aims to help people make well- informed decisions about healthcare by preparing, maintaining and prom oting the accessibility of systematic reviews of the effects of healthcare interventions. Strategic Goals Goal 1: To ensure high quality Cochrane systematic reviews are available across a broad range of healthcare topics. Goal 2: To promote access to Cochrane reviews and the other products of The Cochrane Collaboration. Goal 3: To ensure an efficient, transparent organisational structure and management system for The Cochrane Collaboration. Goal 4: To achieve sustainability of The Cochrane Collaboration. 2005 Strategic Priorities To ensure high quality in Cochrane reviews To improve retrieval of information from Cochrane databases To ensure that the organisational focus supports the core function of preparing, maintaining and promoting the accessibility of reviews To ensure an adequate income stream for The Cochrane Collaboration To ensure that Cochrane Reviews are easy to understand To promote effective communication with people outside The Cochrane Collaboration To ensure that all decisio n-making processes within The Cochrane Collaboration are transparent and explicit To develop a business plan for the core activities of The Cochrane Collaboration To ensure broad coverage of healthcare topics in Cochrane reviews To promote effective communication within The Cochrane Collaboration To recognise and support the efforts of individuals in The Cochrane Collaboration Diagnostic test accuracy activity 2008 Strategic Review Recommendations Reaffirm our primary purpose to be the production of systematic reviews Develop a Marketing and Communications Strategy to promote external and internal awareness of the value arguments for and achievements of The Cochrane Collaboration Establish formal membership for its contributors .

We will sign off on a new publishing contract for The Cochrane Library which will enhance the use and impact of the Library worldwide, and ensure we can continue to provide core infrastructural support to the Collaboration. We will appoint a new CEO to provide leadership, vision and high- level management across the Collaboration. We will seek to develop alternative funding sources (carried over). We will begin to develop a more author - and user - friendly and efficient approach to the organisation of topics within The Cochrane Library (carried over). We will improve the dissemination and uptake of our reviews, and enhance our brand, through the implementation of a coherent marketing and communication strategy (carried over). We will expand the COU to enable it to provide better support for Cochrane groups and individuals worldwide as they seek to implement the vision and mission of the Collaboration. We will form an external advisory board, and enhance our partnerships with external stakeholders of the Collaboration and The Cochrane Library, such a s health information providers, policy -makers and funders (carried over). We will enhance our monitoring and management functions, particularly of individuals, groups and platforms which receive core Collaboration funding and/or use the Cochrane brand, primarily through the Editorial and Operations Units, working w ith relevant executives (c/o). We will sign off on a new publishing contract for The Cochrane Library which will enhance the use and impact of the Library worldwide, and ensure we can continue to provide core infrastructural support to the Collaboration. We will develop a new five -year strategic plan. We will enhance global participation and relevance of The Cochrane Collaboration and The Cochrane Library through the formation of the 'Coc hrane Academy' OPEN ACCESS (carried over). Other We will celebrate our 21st year, and tell the world our story. We will promote generational change within the organisation, particularly within the leadership, ensuring better global and gender equity. 4. The ' Vision ' of the organization is set and is a powerful general statement of the world that the Collaboration is striving to bring abo ut. It is far -reaching, powerful and focused. 5. The ' Mission ' of the organization is much less well used by the Collaboratio n in its external and internal documentation, and we need to remedy this. The Mission does what it should, in outlining the specific role of the Collaboration in contributing to the realization of its Vision. 6. The Strategic Plan of 2002 set out four ' Strategic Goals' that are still in place for the Collaboration. They are: Goal 1: To ensure high quality Cochrane systematic reviews are available across a broad range of healthcare topics. Goal 2: To promote access to Cochrane reviews and the other products of The Cochrane Collaboration. Goal 3: To ensure an efficient, transparent organisational structure and management system for The Cochrane Collaboration. Goal 4: To achieve sustainability of The Cochrane Collaboration. 7. In 2005 the Collabora tion reviewed its strategy and established a set of 12 ' Strategic Priorities ' within these four Strategic Goals with a collection of 80 'Activities' below these priorities. The Activities were sometimes highly specific but most were very general and not SMART ( Specific, Measurable, Realistic & Time -Bound). These 80 Activities are not included in the table for clarity and ease of rea ding the 'big picture' but they are attached as an Annex to the Framework document. 8. In 2008 -09 the Collaboration conducted an in- depth Strategic Review of the organization and its activiti es. This resulted in a set of 25 'Strategic Recommendations ' around and engagement with external stakeholders' . I have now mapped these recommendations (one or two appear in two equally valid columns) against the Collaboration's Strategic Goals - something I don't think was done in 2009. The number and type of recommendations may or may not accurately reflect the nature of the strategic discussions and conclusions of the 2008- 09 review process; but w hat is immediately very striking is that the overwhelming majority of the Review's recommendations (19 of them ) are internally focused (appearing under Goal 3 - on organizational structure, governance and management; or Goal 4 - on internal development to achieve the Collaboration's sustainability). Some of those are externally oriented, such as the development of new products or lines of activities to achieve financial sustainability in Goal 4, but it is obvious that the primary focus of the outcomes of the Review process were inside the Collaboration. 9. Finally, Collaboration members have recently been affirming the yearly ' Strategic Priorities' set by the Steering Group to guide its work each y ear during the organisation's Annual General Meeting . I have mapped the latest set of Priorities for 2012 -13 against the Strategic Goals and although the disparity is not quite as great as for the 2008 -09 Strategic Recommendations, nine of the 13 priorities are also engaged with mainly internal organisational and sustainabili ty challenges. Assessing the Collaboration's Achievements on its Strategi c Goals and Priorities OPEN ACCESS 10. The next table in the document attempts to assess the progress of achievement the Collaboration has made since 2009 in implem enting and completing the Strategic Review Recommendations and - over the last year - its Strategic Pri orities. A basic, admittedly rather crude, traffic light measure has been used: \u00b7 A red shading indicates a Recommendation which has not been achieved (marked 'N'); \u00b7 An orange shading indicates a Recommendation which has begun but not yet completed or was completed soon after 2009 but changed circumstances mean that it now needs further action or is ongoing (marked 'ON'); \u00b7 A green shading indicates a Recommendation which has been completed or achieved (marked 'C'); Strategic Goals Goal 1: To ensure high quality Cochrane systematic reviews are available across a broad range of healthcare topics.

Some of the scoring may be incorrect (it is drawn from discussions with Secretariat staff and the Co- Chairs ) but it is clear that many of the recommendations are still to be achieved, with seven very far from completion and others with much work still to be done. It does not appear that any of the recommendations are no longer important to implement - in fact ma ny are framed very generally and would remain ongoing necessities - so although the Strategic Review was published four years ago this set of strategic recommendations have continuing validity and a considerable distance to travel to completion. OPEN ACCESS 12. The achievement of the strategic priorities for 2012 -13 is much better. Work on marketing and communications plan s was begun and then stopped for the new CEO to take on; and work on promoting generational change within the organisation, development of alternat e funding sources, and creating an external advisory board to support the Steering Group are still to begin properly. However, all of the other strategic priorities coul d be said to have been met or well under way, with many of the ongoing priorities clear ly of major strategic significance and requiring a great deal more time to achieve (such as expansion of the COU; improving management and monitoring; global capacity- building in the production of systematic reviews). Thoughts on a Strategic Planning e xercise in 2013 : 13. My conclusion from this analysis, therefore, is that the Collaboration has a reasonable strategic framework in place, but that it needs to be up dated and refreshed, with two critically important areas of change to take place: Focusing externally 14. I would invite the Collaboration to look again at its mission in terms of defining its place in the world and its ambitions over the next decade in order to do more to bring about its vision that 'healthcare decision- making throughout the world will be informed by high -quality, timely research evidence'. What would that mean? My vision for the Collaboration is more than that set out in the present Mission statement. I want 'Cochrane' to become the 'go to' organisation for everything to do w ith healthcare systematic reviews: when anybody anywhere thinks about systematic reviews in the field of healthcare , they think 'Cochrane'. I want the Collaboration to become a global leader in the promotion of evidence -based medicine, much more influentia l in health policymaking, and much more focused on the users and the uses of our products rather than simple production of systematic reviews. 15. This means that our strategy needs to address much more comprehensively the Collaboration's external place a nd profile in the world; on our content not only in terms of its quality (which must remain the basis of all of our actions) but its application . What are our specific ambitions to reach new and more audiences, and to influence policy- makers ? How can we focus more on the external impact of our organisation and our products and less on the mechanics of the production? How can we respond better to the priorities of others in what, when and why we produce reviews; and how we respond to a revolution in inform ation technology to ensure that our information is seen and used over that produced by others? How and what are the best partnerships to ensure that we build on our strengths, cover our weaknesses and attain wider, deeper global reach? Becoming more supportive and efficient internally 16. This altered strategic focus externally will mean that the internal concerns and recommendations of the Strategic Review must be addressed and completed soon. As discussed above, the recommendations ( and improvement s implementation of them would bring ) remain important strategic priorities for the Collaboration, but we should be more specific in setting out the targets to be reached. 17. I think the Collaboration need s to become more coherent and efficient, in its internal organisation and ways of working; not to dampen the creativity, innovation and dynamism that are the unique characteristics and strengths of the Collaboration but to make them more powerful . Improving our governance, strengthening our management s tructures, supporting our overworked volunteers and engaging them more effectively will enable us to meet the external challe nges in the healthcare and information management sectors that we face. We need to change the author experience as well as the u ser experience for the better: t o try to make OPEN ACCESS the authoring process less intimidating and drawn out; to shorten the production times, and learn from best practice within the Collaboration's Review Groups and other entities in providing more consistent support to authors. Implications on strategic planning: 18. My recommendation is that in the Collaboration's mid -year meetings in Oxford in March the strategic planning session should begin work on a new 'Strategy to 2020' f or the Collaboration focusing on several areas. 1. The Collaboration's 'Vision ' statement should be left unchanged, but that the strategic planning exercise addresses its 'Mission ' statement . The existing statement is tightly focused and well written, but it begs the question as to w hether it is too tightly focused around 'preparing, maintaining and promoting the accessibility of systematic reviews' given its ambitions and its potential wider role in promoting evidence -based healthcare decision - making (see argument above). 2. Four W orking Groups should look at revising the existing four Strategic Goals - keeping their central focus but considering amendments to meet the latest and future challenges (see notes below for more details). In addition, a fifth Working Group should draft a potential new St rategic Goal specifically addressing our ambitions for our place and profile in the world in the next decade. 3. If time permits, these gr oups could then suggest the key strategic priorities that should be considered under each of the fiv e Strategic Goals (for initial framing see notes below). 4. This work would then be shared with the wider Collaboration and a process of consultation undertaken for further development and drafting of the Mission/Goals and priorities. They would also be tested with external stakeholders (including funders). 5. Preferably, after a period of extensive consultation , a draft Strategic Plan could be prepared for discussion and ratification at the AGM at the Collaboration's Quebec Colloquium in September 2013. If more time is needed further strategic consultation and discuss ion could take place in Quebec with a target of finishing a new Strategic Plan in early 2014. 6. The central Secretariat would then establish an operational plan to deliver the strategy wi th measurable targets on an annual or bi -annual basis . OPEN ACCESS Proposed Work - March 2013 (New work highlighted in light tint) Vision Our vision is that healthcare decision -making throughout the world will be informed by high -quality, timely research evidence. Mission The Cochrane Collaboration is an international organisation that aims to help people make well- informed decisions about healthcare by preparing, maintaining and promoting the accessibility of systematic reviews of the effects of healthcare interventions. Comment / Proposal Assess the external challenges over the coming decade for the Collaboration and consider amending the Mission statement to reflect an organisation which is global, which focuses more on accessibility and use , and possibly other elements from the re -development of strategic goals (below) Strategic Goals Goal 1: To ensure high quality Cochrane systematic reviews are available across a broad range of healthcare topics. Goal 2: To promote access to Cochrane reviews and the other products of The Cochrane Collaboration. Goal 3: External Focus Goal 4 : To ensure an efficient, transparent organisational structure and management system for The Cochrane Collaboration. Goal 5 : To achieve sustainability of The Cochrane Collaboration. Comment / Proposal Expand this Goal by inserting relevance, scope, etc. Also expand the ambition by looking to provide 'high quality Cochrane evidence ...' An obvious need to highlight the extent of our Goal to Open Access to Cochrane content (not just reviews) & needs to be much more about Usability and Impact on use . We need a Goal setting our ambitions for our place and profile in the world - I would like us to be the 'Go to' organization for systematic reviews. When people think 'SRs' they think Rewrite to include what kind of organization we want to be. Well governed; inclusive; membership organization; voluntary; effective and efficiently managed . This Goal seems t o me to be still relevant as it is - Detail to be included in the Strategic Objectives . OPEN ACCESS 'Cochrane' and to be a leading organization in evidence -based medicine . Strategic Priorities/Objectives to 2020 Strategic Priorities to highlight fewer, better systematic reviews Strategic Priorities need to highlight specific reach and impact to individual audiences (clinicians, patients/consumers, etc) in their healthcare decision -making. Strategic Priorities to highlight the advocacy, external affairs positioning; the geographical reach and international policy influence; and the capacity - building in spread of EBM. Strategic Priorities to pick up the organizational characteristics/targets we are reaching for; and the character/culture of the Collaboration. Strategic priorities to pick up on the adequate, diversified set of income stream s; and internal skills and competencies. SP 1: SP 1: SP 1: SP 1: SP 1: Resource Implications: 19. There are no immediate resource implications, although the strategic planning process in 2013 will have to be costed once the CCSG and the mid -year meeting have set the terms of the exercise for the Secretariat. Mark G Wilson 12 March 2013 PUBLISHING MANAGEMENT TEAM The Cochrane-Wiley Publishing Management Team. For the Steering Group mid-year meeting, Oxford, UK, 17 M arch 2013, on 8 March 2013. To provide the Steering Group with an update on the establishment and first meeting of the Cochrane-Wiley Publishing Management Team. Low. This is an open access paper. None. This document is for information only. Cochrane and Wiley both recognised the need to strengthen the management of their partnership. The establishment of the Cochrane-Wiley Publishing Management Team was f ormalised in the new publishing agreement signed in February . The principal role of the Team is to m anage the parties' business relationship in order to meet their overall goals; to direct current s trategies and develop future strategies for the publication and delivery of Cochrane content; and to m onitor performance against targets . We have responsibility for delivering the commitments set out in the new publishing agreement. We met for the first time on Wednesday 6 March 2013 at Wiley's offices in Oxford , UK, and will mee t at intervals of not more than eight weeks thereafter, in person or by tele/videoconference. We will alternate responsibility for hosting meetings and each party will be responsible for any costs of its representatives in attending the meetings. The primary purpose of the first meeting was to confirm the membership of the Team, elect a cha irperson and establish governance and reporting responsibilities. The parties had agreed during negotiations for the new publishing agreement that the Team will consist of senior staff from each of the parties to ensure that it has appropriate business, technology, editorial and marketing expertise; and will comprise no more than five representatives each. In addition, each party may invite non-voting guests to meetings for relevant agenda items. Lucie Binder, Project Officer (role TBC) Harriet MacLehose, Senior Editor Chris Mavergames, Director of Web Development David Tovey, Editor in Chief Mark Wilson, Chief Executive Officer The plan is to replace the Director of Web Development with the Head of Informatics & Business Performance should that post be approved by the Steering Group. Mark Wilson will become a director of Cochrane Innovations , the Collaboration's second trading company with responsibility for developing new Cochrane products, so this business element will be represented on the Team. Deborah Dixon, VP Publishing Director Deborah Pentesco-Gilbert, Editorial Director Todd Toler, Director and Publisher Wiley Online Library Jonathan Wynne, Sales Director Fifth seat TBC It is still to be decided whether the fifth seat on the Team will be taken by David Aldea, VP Technology & Chief Technology Officer , or whether Todd and David will share one 'technology seat'. If the latter, Wiley will appoint a fifth member with expertise in a different area. We unanimously agreed that Mark Wilson should chair the Team. This will be reviewed in six months. We agreed that the seniority and business of the Team requires it to have administrative support, including someone to take minutes of proceedings. The responsibility for providing this support will alternate between the parties depending on who is hosting the meeting. The Team does not have one reporting line: each party will report to its own senior management a nd/or governors. In Cochrane' s case this is the Steering Group and in Wiley's case, the Wiley Leadership Team. If, in the opinion of either party, we are unable to fulfil our responsibilities or resolve any dispute which has arisen in relation to our work, either party may refer the matter or dis pute in question for informal resolution by a committee of two representatives of the Steering Group and Leadership Team. We will endeavour, though, to reach unanimous decisions. Each pa rty will have five votes in meetings, irrespective of the actual number of members attending those meetings. The quorum for a meeting will be a minimum of four voting members attending from each party. The Team has overall responsibility for managing the publication and delivery of Cochrane conte nt under the business partnership, and will therefore rely on a regular flow of information from the people and teams working in these areas. No person or team will be directly managed by the Team. New Technology Environment We spent a significant proportion of our first meeting discussing the management of the tec hnology environment in which Cochrane content is published and delivered. We have agreed to establish a Cochrane-Wiley technology working group, reporting to the Management Team, which will have direct responsibility for planning and overseeing the ground-up re - design of the technology environment whilst at the same time ensuring that the projects in the C ochrane Content Publication and Delivery Programme can be delivered within the agreed timeframes, or that changes to the timeframes are justified by the delivery of first-order technology improvements . This working group will be composed of technologists and content specialists from both parties. It will be committed to ensuring that the author and user experience of Cochrane content is continuously improved. We are in the process of developing a standard format for reports to and by the Team. Report topics will include (listed here in no particular order): Updates from the technology working group (content and technology development , including the Cochrane Content Publication and Delivery Programme ) Technology service standards Financial reports, including sales revenue & royalty Derivative product development Open access management and strategy Subscriptions and sales (including progress of negotiations with regional and national licence purchasers) Usage metrics and media coverage statistics Permission and sub-licence management Fulfil ment (customer service) In order to ensure that Team meetings are not dominated by reviewing reports we are in the process of developing a reporting timetable. The reports prepared for Team meetings will form the basis of this Steering Group report on an ongoing basis. The Team will use a combination of online project management and document sharing tools to facilitate communication and shared working between members. On the Monday before the first Team meeting, representatives from the parties met to finalise the arrangements for providing the gold and green open access options agreed under the new publishing agreement. These options will have been publicised on The Cochrane Library by the time of this meeting (17 March 2013) and will be included in the new Publishing and Editorial Policy Manual . In June, the parties will meet in Hoboken, USA, to develop strategies for achieving large-scale open access for Cochrane Reviews and other content.

OPEN ACCESS 3. Usage Usage of The Cochrane Library on Wiley Online Library grew globally by 25% in 2012 . In 2012 The Cochrane Library Homepage received 2.5 million visitors compared with 2.2 million visitors in 2011. These figures and all the following usage figures relate to only the usage on www.thecochranelibrary.com (Wiley Online Library version). It is an underestimate of usage and impact of Cochrane content. It does not include the activities on our partner sites including pubmed, pubmed health, OVID platform, EBSCO platform, cochrane.org, handheld/mobile devices, etc. The data includes direct accesses through Wiley Online Library only. We provide annual usage reports to the Cochrane Steering Group, Cochrane Centres and national prov ision funders, who receive a country level report and Review Groups. In 2012, we supplied materials for funder reports for all Cochrane Review groups. Custom reports are available on request. Abstract Usage In 2012 11,813,920 abstracts were viewed from The Cochrane Library on Wiley Online Library compared with 9,461,246 abstracts in 2011.

Country Year Q1 OPEN ACCESS Press Releases To coincide with each monthly publication (launch) day our PR department work with the Cochrane Editorial Unit to select and deploy approximately 3 press releases on new or updated reviews. The PR department also coordinates with Health Behaviour News Serv ice (HBNS) to deliver news stories with approximately 3 stories per issue. Media training for authors, interview materials for authors, press user guides, free access details and workshop support to regional meetings, including the Association of Healthcare Journalists continue to form the Wiley PR service offerings. In 2012, there have been 4,270 clips and 33 press releases (129 each on av erage), which reached at least 68 countries and were covered in at least 14 languages. Compared with 2011, the number of clips is down from 5,277, but that is skewed because of the Zinc review which had over 1,000 clips. Discounting the zinc review would mean in the same period last year there were 1,529 clips. The most popular stories were: 0 200,000 400,000 600,000 800,000 1,000,000 1,200,000 National Provision countries - Full text downloads 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 OPEN ACCESS Rank Article Title Clips 1 Cochrane Review Finds No Benefit from Routine Health Checks 512 2 Cranberry Juice Now Unlikely to Prevent Cystitis 479 3 Continuing Uncertainties Surround Anti -Influenza Drug 467 4 Cocoa Compounds May Reduce Blood Pressure 373 5 Role of Omega -3 in Preventing Cognitive Decline in Older People Questioned 337 Cochrane Journal Club We continue to publish one journal club a month and by the end of 2012 we have published 38 Journal Clubs. The Top 5 most accessed Cochrane Journal Club articles published during 2012 are as follows: Title Release date Unique Visits* CRG Cold -water immersion (cryotherapy) for preventing and treating muscle soreness after exercise April 3,633 Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Cranberries for preventing urinary tract infections December 3,622 Renal Group Omega 3 fatty acid for the prevention of cognitive decline and dementia July 2,775 Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Interventions for preventing falls in older people living in the community November 2,670 Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Disposable surgical face masks for preventing surgical wound infection in clean surgery March 2,386 Wounds Group * Data is taken from the first two months after release The Cochrane Journal Club website was viewed by users from a total of 177 countries including visits from 77 (73%) of the countries on the Cochrane Evidence Aid programme. Podcasts Potential podcast authors are selected from the list of Cochrane reviews chosen for press release and the podcast editor Mike Clarke selects additional review authors to ensure a balanced coverage of topics. The authors are invited to summarise their revi ew in an audio podcast. Mike Clarke works OPEN ACCESS with the review authors to write a suitable script, with the intention of summarising the review in only 3 -4 minutes. Chris Mavergames provides technical assistance to ensure a high -quality recording is produced. Podcasts continue to be popular with authors and listeners. 2008 - 53 ; 2009 - 59 (including 15 non -English); 2010 - 66 (including 6 non -English) ; 2011 - 52 (including 9 non -English); 2012 - 56 (including 3 non -English). The most visited Podcasts (not i ncluding any RSS feeds or other postings) during 2012 are as follows: Title Release date Unique Visits CRG Cold -water immersion (cryotherapy) for preventing and treating muscle soreness after exercise Feb- 12 626 Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Interventions for preventing obesity in children Dec-11 624 Heart Group Oxygen therapy for acute myocardial infarction Jun-10 438 Heart Group Disposable surgical face masks for preventing surgical wound infection in clean surgery Jan-12 431 Wounds Group Reduced or modified dietary fat for preventing cardiovascular disease Jul-11 396 Heart Group The Cochrane Library - iPad edition In November 2012, The Cochrane Library iPad edition was launched. Up to 12 Cochrane reviews chosen by the Editor -in-Chief and specially abridged to suit iPad users are included in each issue. The reviews are enriched with the addition of multimedia content, including podcasts, videos and slide de cks. The app provides a new method of dissemination for Cochrane Reviews and includes links to the full text versions of the review on The Cochrane Library website. The app is freely available in Apple's iTunes Store. Since January 2013, the app has rec eived 7,254 visits from 3,536 visitors. Visitors have come from countries where usage of Cochrane reviews is traditionally strong such as the UK, USA and Australia but the app is so far proving popular with visitors worldwide with visits from 114 countrie s including 615 visits from Colombia. 4. Bibliometrics /Impact 2011 Impact Factor The 2011 impact factor for the CDSR is 5.912. OPEN ACCESS During the compiling of the 2011 impact factor report, an error was discovered in the calculation of the CDSR impact factor for 2011. Thomson ISI were informed and agreed to publish the amended CDSR impact factor in the September JCR release in mid -late S eptember. The 2011 impact factor of 5.912 describes the ratio of the number of reviews published during 2009(602) and 2010(704) (sum 1306) to the number of citations these reviews received in 2011 (7721). A review published in the CDSR in 2009 or 2010 was cited, on average, 5.912 times in 2011. CDSR is ranked 10th of 153 journals in the \"Medicine, General & Internal\" category, placing it in the top five percent of all titles listed in the ISI Journal Citation Report. The impact factor of the CDSR fell for the first time since the first impact factor was received in 2007. This was mainly due to a high number of articles published in 2010(704) as the CDSR moved from Quarterly to Monthly publication. The CDSR published the highest number of citable items in 2010 of all journals in the Medicine, General and Internal category(153). The next nearest (in t erms of number of articles published), of the journals alongside the CDSR in the top 10 of the category was NEJM(345). Impact Factor Year Number of Articles published % Difference Number of citations received % Difference Impact Factor Web of Knowledge currently lists 1,400 published reviews for the CDSR in 2010(703) and 2011(697). This is subject to change prior to publication of the 2012 JCR but can be seen as a good indicator as to the CDSR denominator for the 2012 impact factor. Co-Publication Under the new 2011 Co -publication policy and procedures the CEU and Wiley administer agreements and permissions to extend the impact of reviews. There are now over 50 Co -publication agreements. 5. Wiley Cochrane Technology Programme The newly formed Cochrane Wiley Publishing Management Team will oversee the Technology programme including The Cochrane Library Technology Roadmap , this was originally drafted using the Paris Strategic Recommendations and was presented at the Auckland Colloquium. Key activities from the Roadmap undertaken since our last report include: \u00b7 New Cochrane Search Enhancements. In December additional enhancements to the new search, launched in September 2012 went live to users. The new search service for The Cochrane Library on Wiley Online Library now includes additional feature such as Did you mean? Spelling suggestion service and the ability to Share a Search via email links . More details on new s earch can be found at: http://www.thecochranelibrary.com/ view/0/ccochnewsearch.html OPEN ACCESS \u00b7 New Ipad Version. In November / December 2012 we launched special editions of the Ipad edition of The Cochrane Library with regular monthly issues starting in January. Download the app from itunes: https://itunes.apple.com/app/id573181475 \u00b7 When- Ready Publication for CDSR . This project has now reached the testing phases and the joint project teams are finalizing launch and communication plans - expected to be in mid -2013 . \u00b7 \"Anywhere Cochrane Review \"- Redesign of CDSR articles . This project will be restarted with the new agreement in place to redesign full text html Cochrane Reviews to vastly improve the user experience and mobile optimisation . 6. Content Management CDSR monthly increase 2012 saw an increase of 10% in the number of records in CDSR, (Dec 2011 = 6967, Dec 2012 = 7626), with a further growth of 1.5% to February 2013 (Feb 2013 = 7745). The reviews and protocols grew at roughly the same rate of 9.5% and 9.7% in 2012. A monthly breakdown, of 2012, shows the average submission maintained at 38 new Reviews, with an 8.6% increase to 43 updated Reviews, and an average of 54 new Protocols a month, up 12.5% from 48 per month. The first 2 months of 2013 indicate increase across all Review and Protocol submissions. 2013 - Averages: New Reviews = 33; New Protocols = 62; Review Updated = 46. The withdrawn Reviews have remained, on average, at 1.5 reviews per month. Protocols have remained at the 6.5 withdrawals, per month for 2012. This is the projection for 2013 with the average continuing for January and February 2013 at 6.5 withdrawals for Reviews and Protocol. CENTRAL Database The monthly publication of the CENTRAL database has been successful in 2012 using the new data from the CRS . CENTRAL has grown by 2% from 666166 to 680109 records in 2012. This has further increased to 683114 records at the February Issue, 2013. Metaxis are now supplying the data and regular communications and production meetings are being held. DVD The DVD has maintained its presence as a reference source for those users without, or who have intermittent, internet access. 500+ DVD are published and distributed globally on a quarterly basis. It will continue to be produced on a quarterly basis through 20 13. Translation Abstracts and PLS Legacy translations supplied to Wiley, are now being converted and loaded to the translation exchange, from the translation partners. Cochrane Centers and groups, we are using the automated process for translating the latest reviews as soon as they are available. The Cochrane Library currently displays over 17,000+ review versions, of which 5492 have unique translations. 32% of the available review versions have a translation. The linguistic division is a as follows Sp anish = 584; French = 2137 ; Japanese = 10 (sample); Traditional Chinese = 2663 and Simplified Chinese = 98 Chinese (Simplify) . The new Cochrane XML for translations has been adopted by the French and Spanish translators and they are supplying the data to Wiley for loading. Phase II of the Non- English Translation project is seeing the translations loading into Archie for storage and process. Only legacy datasets beyond automated conversion will be processed manually by Wiley. OPEN ACCESS 2012 -2013 Completed Activ ities and Change Requests Change requests and modifications to the content and productions systems were undertaken to improve both Cochrane and customer user experiences including: CEU Editorial accepted into PubMed; Datafeed to NHS Scotland; Datafeed to NICE for English national provision; eLENA Free Article processing for WHO (e-library of Evidence for Nutrition Actions); UCSF free access processing; Search Strategy heading changed to Search Methods on all 4929 CDSR Reviews;' Share This' on Facebook display changed to citation; PDF Rendering Service released to all CRGs; Additional Tables relocation on PDF versions; Footnote for graphs included; Subtotals included for graphs included; Translation management for legacy translations; Editorial unit additio ns to home page links; New Search information linking from homepage; Central processing from CRS sign off; RevMan 5.2 DTA review processing; PRISMA compliance style and delivery changes; New Search functionality; Free Access maintenance on CEU compiled content and processing; Editorial display changes to allow additional Editorial (s) and Special Collections; Homepage Browse List updates; Evidence Aid free access processing and monitoring; Publish When Ready project progression; ABOUT database feasibility r equest for change to data provision; Open Access processing for New and Updated reviews from February 2013; Complimentary Subscription automation feasibility and further progression towards Archie access process. Free Article Access Control and Open Access Since August 2011 Individual reviews can be made freely available to all on The Cochrane Library . This is currently extended to articles included in the WHO e -library of Evidence for Nutrition Actions (eLENA) and has been extended to include reviews included in The Cochrane Library Special Collections for the duration of their position on The Cochrane Library homepage. Evidence Aid collections are freely available. 33 reviews were submitted, under 12 month embargo, as per author funding requests including NIH grantees to PubMed Central and PubMed Central Canada. A new Open Access policy has been agreed as pa rt of the new Publishing Agreement and will be implemented and publicized in 2013. Copy Edit Support This service continues t o be fully funded by Wiley . In December 2012 Elizabeth Royle was appointed as CES Manager taking over from Gavin Stewart, Associate Editor for The Cochrane Library at Wiley who acted in the interim role of CES administrator. Harriet MacLehose and John Hilton from the CEU and Elizabeth have begun working together to refine a proposed copy -editing work -plan that will clarify the copy -editing -related work that the C EU and Copy Edit Support will undertake over the coming year, and which team will be responsible for the different activities. A summary of proposed activities for 2013 include: (1)Implement the policy that all Cochrane Review Groups will submit all Cochrane Protocols and Reviews to CES or an in -house copy -editor b efore publication (by May 2012) (2) Set up management and administrative processes for the CES team (3) Develop and implement an accreditation process for prospective in -house copy -editors and new CES copy -editors (4) Update the Cochrane Style Guide and related website periodically (5) Develop and update copy -editing checklists; and develop a policy for their use (6) Audit the work of copy -edito rs, and provide training and information -sharing opportunities for copy - editors (7) Provide training and support for copy -editors (8) Evaluate the copy -editing activities and report back to the Collaboration OPEN ACCESS Submissions to Copy Edit Support The number of s ubmissions to Copy Edit Support increased in 2012. An average of 92 requests for copy -editing were received per month in 2012, 65% of total submissions for publication. On average 24 % of total submissions in 2012 were 'Deadline Submissions' (rece ived on or 48 hours before the CES deadline). 7. Sales, Dissemination and Marketing Campaigns This report focuses on providing a brief overview of the marketing activities of 2012 and work plans for the future. Global Marketing Activities E-mail campaigns and web advertising New issue 'launch emails' campaigns The Cochrane Library is updated every month with new reviews. We promote every new issue 'launch' with an email campaign to relevant Wiley -Blackwell e -mail lists. The e -mail campaigns are deployed to an average of 75,000 contacts with an average CTOR (click -to-open rate) of 16.53. CTOR measur es the number of people who clicked compared to the total number who opened , thus helping to evaluate the quality of our content and engagement of subscribers . In the last six months, our CTOR has 105 90 72 88 118 94 120 92 83 92 84 68 26 26 12 38 24 37 31 29 20 17 16 0 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Submissions to CES 2012 Total Submissions 'Deadline' Submissions OPEN ACCESS nearly doubled, increasing from an average of 8.98 six months ago and just 5.61 one year ago. This marked increase reflects our efforts to narrow our list usage to include just those subscribers who actively engage with Cochrane content; this metric also indicates we are successfully choosing content which interests our subscribers. Our average click -through rate is 3 .31%, up from 3.0 % six months ago and 2.6% one year ago. A 'good' click through rate is c onsidered to be 3% or above . We are continually monitoring these figures and refining the email lists in order to further improve the figures for The Cochrane Library . The top ten links in our launch campaigns over the past six months include two editori als, seven reviews, and one survey. The wealth of reviews in the top ten is encouraging as these are typically featured toward the middle of the e -mails, thus requiring readers to scroll down to find and click the links. The inclusion of reviews tell us th at readers are engaging with our e -mails beyond just a passing glance at the message headline, while the editorials and survey reinforce that our readers are interested in a variety of content types. The most popular link in the last six months was the D ecember editorial on statins. 1500 unique subscribers clicked on this editorial link, an impressive portion of our total readership. This excellent result indicates that the launch e -mail continues to be a valuable means of communicating forthcoming change s and announcements for The Cochrane Library. Top 10 E -mail Links: August 2012 -January 2013 Month Name Click Count Unique Subscribers Click Percent (%) December Editorial: Convincing evidence from controlled and uncontrolled studies on the lipid -lowering effe ct of a statin 1774 1500 Cranberries for preventing urinary tract infections 1294 1080 13.6 August Review: Effect of cocoa on blood pressure 1110 1005 25.4 November Review: Vitamin E for Alzheimer's dementia and mild cognitive impairment 889 779 11.3 September Editorial: Procalcitonin: Hope in the fight against antibiotic resistance? 738 634 6.8 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 Mar-12 Survey: The Cochrane Library Reference Guid e 717 33 0.1 September Review: Interventions for preventing falls in older people 584 452 8.5 November Review: Exercise for the management of cancer -related fatigue 534 437 7 October Review: General health checks in adults for reducing morbidity and mortality 519 444 4.9 January Editorial: Evidence supports TB test, so what now? 498 418 5.9 E-newsletters New reviews, podcasts and other information about The Cochrane Library such as the Special Collections are promoted in the Wiley -Blackwell quarterly Evidence -Based Healthcare e -newsletter, reaching over 45,000 contacts . In the past four Evidence -Based Medicine newsletters, Cochrane reviews have represented 3 of the 5 most -clicked links. The Cochrane Library is also regularly promoted in the Medical Librarian e - newsletter. To publicize the new search functionality launched in 2012, a dedi cated campaign was sent to the library e -mail list which reaches over 8,000 medical librarians . Web advertising Web links to The Cochrane Library and details of new Cochrane podcasts, reviews , and journal clubs are placed on the health care subject and journal web pages on Wiley Online Library. These ads typically receive anywhere from 10 ,000 to 5 0,000 impressions depending how long they are scheduled to run. In the past year, these banners have been used to promote the launch of the Cochrane iPad Edition; new changes to search functionality; the global access infographic; and each month's Journal Club issue. The top three banner ads placed in the last year are listed below; by far the most successful was the advertisement for The Cochrane Library iPad Edition. This ad (at right) was first placed in December 2012 and has performed impressively in just three short months with over two million impressions and over one thousand clicks at the time of this report. This ad is still active and will continue to drive app downloads in the following months. \u00b7 Cochrane Library iPad Edition: 2,196,317 impressions / 1 ,349 clicks \u00b7 Cochrane Search Tools Now Available (post -launch): 204,997 impressions / 121 clicks \u00b7 Cochrane Search Tools Coming Soon (pre -launch): 57,928 impressions / 31 clicks Print promotions OPEN ACCESS We continue to produce and distribute the following promotional materials for The Cochrane Library : - The Cochrane Library Reference Guide (including translations) - Cochrane Library banner stands - Cochrane Library pens, bookmarks and notepads The Cochrane Library also featured in the Evidence -Based Healthcare promotional materials including the catalogue and mini banner stand which are sent to conferences and events throughout the year. International conference promotion In 2012 The Cochrane Library was pr omoted at more than 2 25 global medical conferences that Wiley attended, representing over 35 clinical specialties including medical library meetings. Copies of The Cochrane Library Reference Guide are sent to every medical conference attended by Wiley, and The Cochrane Library banner stands are sent to key shows. For large conferences such as the Medical Library Association , custom materials are printed and sent to ensure The Cochrane Library is heavily promoted . As part of our Promotional Support Process, marketing items for The Cochrane Library have been sent to even more conferences via Cochrane entities and review groups whose members attend those shows. The Cochrane Library logo and website has been added to conference program ads, specialty pop -up stands , CD-ROMs, and flash drives for specialty medical subject conferences. For Cochrane events we have been unable to attend, such as Cochrane Centres' Symposiums, we have worked with the organizers to send promotional materials, delegate bag inserts, and custom giveaways. For the 201 2 Annual Cochrane Colloquium in Auckland, we provided design, sourcing, and funding of several conference items for atten dees. In addition, we completed the following activities: \u00b7 Ongoing demonstrations on the Wiley booth, including new Search functionality, a preview of the iPad app, and Twitter tutorials \u00b7 Designed and provided lanyards, conference bags, notepads, and pens f or conference attendees \u00b7 Designed and provided flash drives containing links to extensive range of resources on The Cochrane Library and peripheral products \u00b7 Featured an on -booth TV monitor displaying a stream of tweets with the hashtag #CochraneAuckland and offered free t -shirts to encourage the dissemination of Cochrane information via social media \u00b7 Created an innovative digital booth designed to provide attendees electronic access to a variety of online resources and rolling presentations as well as Wiley's books and journals \u00b7 Hosted a Journal Club reception and awards ceremony attended by authors and podcasters Social media The Cochrane Library has been active on social media throughout 2012 and our social reach has grown exponentially. Facebook From March 2012 to March 2013 , The Cochrane Library Facebook page received 3, 464 total clicks. In the same time period, the page's fan count increased by 57% to reach 4,977 lifetime likes. OPEN ACCESS The chart below reflects Total Daily Reach, calculated by adding Lifet ime Total Likes (exactly how many people like your page) to Daily Friends of Fans (how many friends of those total likes can be reached). This metric represents our true total reach ; the graph below demonstrates that our Total Daily Reach has increased by 71% since March 2012 and 225% since September 2011. The demographics of our fans reflect the overall popularity of social media with the 25 -34 age group. Fans of the Facebook page are mostly female in all age groups except those users aged 45 -54 and 65+. These demographic details have remained largely unchanged since September 2011: Examining the geographic locations of our Facebook fans reveals that the top countries represented are Egypt (486) followed by the US (408), the UK (250), Italy (250), and India (247). Just six months ago, Egypt was in third place behind the US and UK. The top city for our fans is now Cairo. By far, the majority of our fans list English as their default language (2711 fans) with Spanish a distant second (684 fans). Reach Total Daily Reach OPEN ACCESS One of the most valuable features of Facebook is the ability for fans to share and discuss page posts. In examining the gender and age of those fans who have engaged with our page in this way, there has been a notable shift in demographics. While September 20 12's statistics indicated the majority of social sharing came from the 25 -34 age group, the March 2013 analytics indicate that this is broadening to include more fans from other age groups. As fan interaction is key to increased reach, this data will be used to inform our strategy going forward in order to maximize increased post interactions. September 2012 vs. March 2013 Twitter Through March 2013, The Cochrane Library's Twitter account (@cochranelibrary ) has increased its total follower count to 4,597 total followers, an increase of 54% from 2,489 just six months ago. In March 2012, our Klout score was 37.49 out of a possible 100; as of September 2012, it has increased significantly to a total score of 5 8. Klout uses data from our social networks to measure how many people we influence; how much we influence them; and the influence of our network. For comparison, here are Klout scores for similar accounts: \u00b7 @WHO: 95 \u00b7 @cochranecollab: 62 \u00b7 @CochraneLibrary: 5 8 \u00b7 @BMJGroup: 57 \u00b7 @UkCochraneCentr: 52 \u00b7 @PubMedHealth: 52 \u00b7 @CochraneBack: 45 Our Klout score increased considerably in the first few months of 2012, and showed even more dramatic improvement over the rest of the year thanks to a new social media strategy driving improvements in our overall effectiveness. OPEN ACCESS From March 2012 through March 2013, we received 4851 total clicks on Twitter. The graph below indicates that while there are peaks and valleys depending on the popularity of particular posts, on the who le our clicks have steadily grown throughout the year. Examining the geographic locations of clicks reveals a slightly different set of countries than were found in our Facebook analytics, likely due to differing popularity of various social networks in specific countries. For our Twitter posts, the top countries represented are the UK, US, Canada, Spain, and the EU (general classification). With accounts on both Facebook and Twitter, The Cochrane Library has reached a global community of healthcare professionals, librarians, researchers and students. OPEN ACCESS Promotional support for entities The promotional support request process forms another key part of the marketing support for the Cochrane Collaboration. Twice per year we provide formal marketing support for all Cochrane entities. Over the last year, Wiley's promotional support process has lent its marketing efforts to five Cochrane centres, twenty review groups, and six Cochrane entities spanning nine different countries. The support offered by Wiley has included everything from sponsorship funds given toward the attendance of a conference to sourcing and print costs for custom promotional materials designed especially for the requesting group. Here are a few ex amples of the materials we have provided to the requesting Cochrane entities in 2012 : \u00b7 3,344 copies of The Cochrane Library Reference Guide \u00b7 1,525 Cochrane Library bookmarks Library notepads \u00b7 1014 Cochrane Library sticky pads \u00b7 A custom web and e -mail banner for the Cochrane Occupational Safety & Health Review Group \u00b7 A custom web/e -mail/social media banner for the Cochrane Back Review Group \u00b7 Custom USB cards for the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group \u00b7 Flash drives for the Cochrane qualitative research methods group \u00b7 Funds for integrating brochures & folders in conference bags to advertise the Austrian Cochrane Branch \u00b7 Custom flyers for twelve different review groups \u00b7 Free trials for delegates at workshops and events throughout the year \u00b7 Distribution of Cochrane Library promotional materials for conferences and events the entities are attending Throughout 2013, we plan to use our existing promotional support infrastructure to provide entities with materials promoting the Collaboration's 20 th anniversary. Country focused marketing In addition to the global marketing activities detailed above we have also carried out marketing campaigns for specific countries. These countries we selected through analysis of subscriptions and revenue, usage and from discussions with the Editor -in-Chief and CEO. The table below shows the countries selected for targeted marketing campaigns and their tier: TIER DEFINITION COUNTRIES 1 High revenue markets to protect National Provision countries and other important licenses OPEN ACCESS 2 High revenue markets with potential to grow USA, Canada, Germany 3 Low revenue markets with potential to grow France, Turkey, China, Middle East 4 East Asi a Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong 5 Low Revenue markets t o develop/protect Rest of world Some examples of Tier activities to date: National Provisions (Tier 1) Each national provision country has a local marketing plan. New activities undertaken include 'One -Click' free access web banner for charities, agencies, societies and colleges, Wiley -Blackwell journals pages and local search engines to promote Cochrane access and special collections (where relevant) on national health awareness days. (E. g. National Non- smoking day). - In February 2013, we sponsored and attended the Special Library Association (Arabian Gulf Chapter) Symposium in support of our new national provision in Oman. - At the SLA, Deborah Pentesco -Gilbert led a \"train the trainer\" ses sion, an evidence based change workshop focused on Cochrane, and a workshop on navigating The Cochrane Library. - Certificates were provided to all workshop participants. USA (Tier 2) - At the 2012 Medical Library Association we ran Cochrane training seminars, held booth demos and distributed promotional materials. We also promoted new Cochrane search functionality with even more demos and conference sessions. - We set up and promoted free one -month trials at a selection of US healthcare conferences inc luding the AAO , the STFM, SRNT, and Medical Library Association. Taiwan and South Korea (Tier 4) - We provided free country -wide access in South Korea and Taiwan during the Taiwan Evidence Based Medicine Associat ion Conference in September 2012 . The free two -month access was also promoted with a press release. In addition, we sponsored Mike Clarke's keynote address and provided a separate conference sponsorship for the meeting. Focus on clinical specialties In addition to targeting key countries we have also identified six clinical specialties to focus our marketing efforts on. These specialties are: - Oncology - Neurology - Nursing & Midwifery - Dermatology - Cardiology - Dentistry Marketing activities to date include : OPEN ACCESS - Dedicated pages on Dentistry and Dermatology USB sticks which have been distributed at related conferences throughout the year - A special issue of 'Cardiovascular Disease Update' promoting The Cochrane Library to cardiology e - news subscribers - Dedicated space in the subject newsletters and ads on the Wiley Online Library pages for these specialties - New reviews have been promoted in related Wiley- Blackwell clinical specialty e -newsletters, including Skin Matters, Oncology Online, Gastro -Hep News, Dentistry n ewsletter , Neurology Newswire, The Cutting Edge, Endocrinology Newswire, Mind Matters, Infectious Disease Update, and Discover Nursing . Each issue reaches on average 25,000 contacts from our internal database. - Twitter posts from @CochraneLibrary are routin ely provided to Wiley marketers who manage Twitter accounts in the six specialty areas as well as general Wiley Health social media accounts so that messages can be shared/retweeted to their own followers. The Cochrane Library is also promoted more widely through additional Wiley subject marketing. Cochrane Journal Club Email campaigns For each new monthly issue of The Cochrane Journal Club, we deploy an email campaign to contacts from our internal database of related disciplines. The Journal Club email is deployed to approx . 80,000 contacts. An average of 20 % of recipients open the e-mail, an increase from 14% one year ago . Click to open rates (CTOR) now average 12%. These increases are a result of our continued efforts to refine our e -mail lists. Clinical specialty e -newsletters The Journal Club is also promoted in related clinical specialty e -newsletters deployed to Wiley contacts. In the past year, relevant Journal Club s have been promoted in Skin Matters, the GastroHep Newsletter, The Cutting Edge, Endocrinology Newswire, the Infectious Disease Newsletter, and more. Web advertising For each new Journal Club we produce a web banner which is placed on related clinical sp ecialty and journal pages on Wiley Online Library . These banners received between 3000 and 10000 impressions depending how long they are displayed . Social Media New Journal Club issues are also promoted via The Cochrane Library , Cochrane Journal Club and r elated Wiley specialty Twitter and Facebook pages. In the past six months, The Cochrane Journal Club's Facebook page has received 638 new likes, bring ing the total fan count to 3706 . Fan demographics are similar to those reported above for The Cochrane Library's Facebook page with no significant differences noted. Print promotions Banner stands have been produced to encourage re adership of the Journal Club; promotions have also been placed in the Evidence -Based Healthcar e Collection catalogue. All items are sent to rel evant conferences and events throughout the year. The Cochrane Library iPad Edition OPEN ACCESS The Cochrane Library iPad Edition was launched with a full online marketing campaign, including site banners, ads on Wiley Online Library, e -mail promotion, and social media blasts. As highlighted earlier in this report, an online advertisement for The Cochrane Library iPad Edition has received over two million impressions and over one thousand clicks since being placed in December. This high -performing ad is still active and will continue to drive app downloads in the following months. Since launch, The Cochrane Library iPad edition has performed extreme ly well when compared with Wiley's slate of medical apps. Below is a comparison of The Cochrane Library iPad Edition with Wiley's most -downloaded health sciences apps in their first six weeks post -launch. In every metric, The Cochrane Library app has outpe rformed Wiley's strongest medical apps. This is especially impressive when you consider that the other apps are available on multiple platforms while The Cochrane Library app is currently limited to iPad. Unique Visitors and Visits/Sessions 0 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 6,000 7,000 Unique Visitors Visits/Sessions OPEN ACCESS A full marketing plan for The Cochrane Library iPad Edition is available upon request. Cochrane Learning Marketing plans for Cochrane Learning and Dr Cochrane Canada are underway; logo and page design are nearly complete and will be ready in early 2013. Marketing for Dr Cochrane will focus initially on Canadian practitioners targeted through partnership opportunities with relevant Canadian associations; through online and e -mail marketing; and through Wiley's extensive ne twork of Canadian sales teams. After the Canadian launch is complete, we will look to extend our marketing campaigns to reach a global audience. A full marketing plan for the Dr Cochrane Canada pilot launch is available upon request. Cochrane Clinical Answers Wiley's Health Sciences Product Management team is engaged in an in- depth market research project aiming to pilot Cochrane Clinical Answers to select institutions in our subscriber base. The goal of this market research is to gain insight on the market view of Cochrane Clinical Answers to better inform our go-to-market strategy and sales plan. This research is scheduled to be completed April 2013. A marketing plan is currently in development for Cochrane Clinical Answers with the final plan contingent upon the current market research findings. 0 20,000 40,000 60,000 80,000 100,000 120,000 140,000 160,000 Total Screen Views Total Screen Views OPEN ACCESS Cochrane Book Series Cochrane series books are available in f our different digital formats.

Higgins: Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Lifetime sales for the hardcover edition of this book stand at 5,438 through February 2013 . Combined digital versions of the book raise the tally by 3 89 copies, bringing total sales across all platforms to 5, 827. Of particular note are the Online Edition f igures, which make up nearl y half of all digital sales. 219 copies have been sold through Wiley Online Library, indicating popularity with librarians and institutions. Hofmeyr: A Cochrane Guide to Pregnancy and Childbirth Lifetime sales for the paperback edition of this book stand at 2, 394 through February of 201 3. Combined digital versions of the book add 1 58 units, bringing total sales across all platforms to 2,552. As with the Higgins book, Online Edition figures are the largest contributor to digital sales. 81 copies have been sold through Wiley Online Library, which is more than double the amount sold through ePDF, ePUB, and Kindle formats. Hill: The Knowledgeable Patient: Communication and Participation in Health Lifetime sales for this book stand at 596 copies sold in the first seventeen months of publication . While the bulk of the sales come from the paperback edition, Wiley Online Library sales look promising at 47 units and digital units as a whole make up 1 7% of overall sales. Abra ha: A Cochrane Handbook o f Alcohol and Drug Misuse With just five months of sales history to report, unit sales are looking strong with 201 copies sold since the book published five months ago. Impressively, an additional 72 units have sold through digital mediums, meaning digital sales comprise over one -quarter of the total book sales. This represents a greater proportion of total sales than have been seen with any of the other books in the Cochrane series. Digital sales are evenly split between Wiley Online Library (representing institutional sales) and ePDFs (likely to indicate personal sales). Compared with the first year sales of Hofmeyr (256), the lifetime sales potential is extremely promising. This book published in September 2012, launching at the Cochrane Colloquium in Auckland. Cover artwork was displayed prominently on the Wiley booth, and review copies were distributed to major publications immediately upon release. The book has been promot ed through Wiley's extensive network of sales teams and has been publicized through The Cochrane Library's social media accounts and Wiley's e-marketing. This book was also be added to the \"go anywhere\" list to be displayed at all medical conferences atten ded by Wiley in 2012 and 2013. OPEN ACCESS 8.

Executive summary This document outlines the rationale and potential impact of a comprehensive and sustainable Cochrane translation strategy. It provides background on past and on-going Cochrane translation activities, and presents and recommends key approaches and strategic decisions to inform the Steering Group on possible options for conducting a long-term, centralised, translation project. While it provides a summary of estimated resource implications, it does not include a detailed budget proposal. B. Background A number of projects translating Cochrane materials have been conducted in the past, and several small or bigger projects are currently on-going or planned (see Appendix 1 for details)1. All of them have been initiated, co-ordinated, funded and published by Cochrane Centres, Review Groups or Cochrane external organisation based in non-English speaking countries, without any resources, funding or infrastructure provided by The Cochrane Collaboration centrally. The results are spread over different platforms, many of them partially outdated and difficult to track. The most comprehensive and sustained project has been conducted by the Iberoamerican Cochrane Centre over the past 15 years, but other initiatives have also been, or are still, enabling access to Cochrane content in a variety of languages: French, Japanese, Simplified and Traditional Chinese, German, and Portuguese. It has only been relatively recently that the Collaboration has started to become aware of the importance of translations. At the Split Mid-Year Meetings 2011, the issue was addressed in the Strategic Session on \"Ensuring The Cochrane Collaboration enables better global participation\". The final report included recommendations on language support \"for authors whose first language is not English, with a focus on providing language, not methods, support\"2. While the identified required actions included very good suggestions, to date none of these have been implemented. After the Split Mid-Year Meeting, the Cochrane Translation Working Group was set up by Lorne Becker on David Tovey's request, because of the increasing need for co ordination of various Cochrane translation initiatives. The working group was constituted of representatives of the groups providing translations, plus those responsible for the technical implementation, including programmers based at the IMS, the Web Team and Wiley-Blackwell. The group has mainly been working on supporting on-going translation projects of Cochrane abstracts and Plain Language Summaries (PLS), on improving work flows and infrastructure for managing and publishing these translations, and serving as a point of contact for people interested in translations. However, there was no dedicated budget allocated to the working group, which made progress and action relatively slow and certainly limited the extent of the work that was manageable. After the Paris Mid-Year Meeting (April 2012), translation strategy and its implementation were identified as one of the components of the Cochrane Content Publication & Delivery Programme (under Workstream 3: Dissemination and Impact), but progress in this area has been limited to the efforts of the Translation Working Group, with substantial contributions from the Cochrane IMS and 1An update on currently on-going and planned translation activities is also provided in the progress report of the Translation Working Group which is included in the Editor- in-Chief 's report to the CCSG. 2See page 8 of the final report . Required action items identified were: Define roles of CRGs, centres and editorial base in supporting authors whose first language is not English Determine how best to provide tech nical writing support and English copy editing support Identify and form a network of key individuals in the Collaboration with multilingual skills Develop/source materials to teach Centre and CRG staff intercultural communication skills, e.g. use of clarifications, avoidance of jargon Standardize terminology across the Collaboration OPEN ACCESS Web Team. In line with what had been proposed for the Cochrane Content programme, one of the 'highlights' of the new Publishing Arr angement with Wiley constitutes a multi-lingual content plan which includes \"implementing search support for multiple languages, which will enable users to search The Cochrane Library in the official languages of the World Health Organization (and other languages as agreed) and have the titles of all relevant Cochrane Reviews returned to them in the translated language via a user interface that has also been translated\". At the Auckland Colloquium, the CCSG identified translation as a priority for the organisation and signalled its intention to invest in this area over the next five years. Lorne Becker was charged to develop a budgeted strategy over the next five years to be presented to the Steering Group for consideration at its meeting in March 20133. Wh ile it wasn't feasible to produce a detailed plan in this timeframe, an ad-hoc working group has been formed to develop this proposal advising the Steering Group on the 'broad direction of travel', including consideration of the key issues, and recommendations. The working group was led by Xavier Bonfill, who approached members and consultants as listed above. Juliane Ried had been freed up for a day a week to support the working group under the direction of Xavier. C. Proposals and discussion 1. Importance of translations for The Cochrane Collaboration The Collaboration's vision is \"that healthcare decision -making throughout the world will be informed by high- quality, timely research evidence\" and that it \"will play a pivotal role in the production and dissemi nation of this evidence across all areas of health care\"4. Among the ten key principles of the Collaboration, there are two that clearly commit to becoming a global organisation responding to the needs of people in any country, regardless of their economic or linguistic background: Promoting access by wide dissemination of the outputs of the Collaboration, taking advantage of strategic alliances, and by promoting appropriate prices, content and media to meet the needs of users worldwide Enabling wide part icipation in the work of the Collaboration by reducing barriers to contributing and by encouraging diversity From a linguistic point of view, the world is very diverse. The largest languages by native speakers are Mandarin (14%), Spanish (6%), and English (5%)5. Although in many countries most educated health professionals can read texts in English, many others are not capable of doing so. If we consider the general population as potential consumer of Cochrane materials, then the proportion of people who can be reached and influenced at the moment is actually surprisingly small . Furthermore, evidence from the usage statistics of the Biblioteca Cochrane Plus (the Spanish version of The Cochrane Library ) has repeatedly demonstrated that universal access to content in the local language increases usage substantially, in this case reaching more than four million users every year. Lately, the addition of French content on Cochrane Summaries has showed this effect as well: Access to Cochrane Summaries by French-speaking users has tripled from September 2012 to February 2013, and France is now ranking third among the countries most accessing Cochrane Summaries. At the same time, the number of French translations increased from around 1000 to 2500, and the French interface and search functions were improved. 3 See item 15, page 8, of the Auckland minutes, available at www.cochrane.org/community/organisation- administration/minutes-reports/full-meetings-ccsg . 4 See http://www.cochrane.org/about-us/our-principles . 5 See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers . OPEN ACCESS Issues related to dissemination and impact are not the only disadvantage of the Collaboration's mostly monolingual being. There is also a need to overcome the barriers that hamper wider participation of non-native English speakers in the Collaboration. For example, it is a well-known problem that non-native English speakers face difficulties being accepted as review authors or contributors in other capacities due to their (supposed or real) limited English skills.6 If the Collaboration continues to produce its materials in English only, and does not effectively address the problems arising from being monolingual, it will fail in fulfilling the aforementioned two principles of the organisation and in achieving the impact it needs and wants to have. As a first step, this conclusion must be acknowledged by the Collaboration to then be able to adopt the strategies and take the decisions that may be required going forward. 2. Proposed underlying translation strategy - adoption of simplified English Global English-speaking work environments involving native speakers of different languages are challenging and impact negatively on the effectiveness of communication and productivity7. Highly complex and technical English, as it is applied in Cochrane Reviews and most other Cochrane content, has negative implications on the production, readability and translation of content: Review authoring: it limits the possibility for non-native English speaking authors to contribute. User experience: it decreases the readability, clarity and consistency of the content for both non-native English and native English speakers. An example of a highly complex sentence from a Cochrane Review is provided in the footnote8. Translations: it increases the cost of translation and edition, incites mistakes in the translations, and thus hinders or limits the feasibility of translation. Although English is the accepted language of communication of the Collaboration, most non-native speakers do use a somewhat simplified English in the Collaboration's work environment. If the Collaboration wants to truly enable global participation and accessibility, it would be highly desirable that the Collaboration adopts the language which facilitates productivity and communication best, which means moving from a more formal and technical English to a kind of standardised 'Simplified English'9. As used in other areas, Simplified English aims to: 6 See: Ciapponi A, Glujovsky D, Rey Ares L, Garc\u00edaMart\u00ed S, Reveiz L. (2011).

DOI: 10.1177/1075547012437442. 8 \"For comparisons where there were non-overlapping studies that examined therapeutic success, global improvement (by doctor) or global improvement (by patient), w e also examined the outcome of 'any success' at the end of treatment using data on global improvement (by doctor) when therapeutic success data were not available and data on global improvement (by patient) when neither therapeutic success nor global improvem ent (by doctor) were available.\" According to the Gunning Fog index an English speaker would require 34.8 years of formal education to understand this sentence.

The example was part of the primary outcomes section of the review, which has been updated in the meantime and doesn't include this sentence anymore. 9Kamprath et al. call it a 'controlled language' (CL), which is a normalised form of a natural language, generally involving a restricted vocabulary list, a streamlined grammar and a prescribed set of stylistic rules. See: Kamprath C., E. Adolphson, T. Mitamura, & E. Nyberg 1998. Controlled English for multilingual document production: experience with Caterpillar Technical English. In: Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Controlled Language Applications (CLAW98), 51- 61. OPEN ACCESS Reduce ambiguity Improve the clarity of technical writing, especially procedural writing Improve comprehension for people whose first language is not English Make human translation easier, faster and more cost effective Facilitate computer-assisted translation and machine translation10 Simplified or Plain English is, at least in the UK, not an alien concept. The Plain English Campaign is \"Fighting for crystal-clear communication since 1979 \"11, and the most recent article on their website is reporting on a new study that investigated how complex medical jargon puts people's lives at risk, indicating that \" nearly half of working-age people cannot understand or use everyday health information \"12. Simplified English is increasingly recognised as an important strategy to facilitate translation.13 For example, Philippe Ravaud has assembled a multidisciplinary research group (QUARTET M) in Paris, specialised in linguistics, text mining and automatic translation. Rather than focusing on the technical problems of automatic translation only, they have shifted to a novel approach and included concepts such as Simplified English and writing aid tools into their efforts. Their work has fed into this proposal. Adoption of a 'Simplified Medical English' or 'Simplified Cochrane English' has increase Cochrane's productivity, inclusiven ess, accessibility, readability, and user experience, the latter which ties in with a project on readability of our reviews which is currently conducted by the CEU within the Cochrane Content Programme14. And, most importantly in the context of this proposal, it would increase the feasibility of human and machine translation dramatically. Besides, we suspect that the usage of Simplified English a) would have a positive effect on Google search results, i.e. Cochrane content would be easier to find; and b) could enhance the development of derivative products, as it may facilitate automatic extraction of data. The implementation strategy for Simplified English should include the following components: Introduction of standardised terminology and writing guides . Writing aid software that can directly feedback on the 'simplicity' of a sentence during the writing process, and suggest better, i.e. clearer, easier and more translatable sentences15. A writing aid tool linked to, or incorporated into, RevMan for example, would not only help non-native English-speakers write better English in their reviews, but at the same time help native English-speakers write clearer English. Development of standard templates and standard phrases , e.g. for protocols, abstracts and other sections of a review, composed in Simplified English. Central copy-edit support . Training in this area for review authors and others producing Cochrane content. 10As described for Simplified Technical English, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Technical_English for more details. See also: Gledhill, C. 2011. Simplified Technical English: from the description of a new technolect to a critique of New-speak. Paper presented at 32\u00e8me Colloque du GERAS, 17 2011, Universit\u00e9 de Bourgogne. 11 See http://www.plainenglish.co.uk . The Plain English also on the 'Simple English' Wikipedia: http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page . The Cochrane Summaries site, which focuses on the Plain Language Summaries of Cochrane Reviews, won the campaign's 2011 web award. 12 See http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/news/x-rated-study- on-confusing-medical-terms-plain-english-campaign-prescribes- cure.html . 13 See http://www.translationdirectory.com/articles/article1359.php for a discussion, and www.muegge.cc for a working example. 14 Some CRGs have also been discussing issues around readability within their groups. 15 For an example of an English writing aid software see: http://www.smartny.com/maxit.htm . OPEN ACCESS We expect that all of the above would reduce the editing burden of CRGs, facilitate and speed up authoring, and improve readability of Cochrane Reviews. It would facilitate translation in general, but also enable much more correct automatic translation, as similar or repeated phrases are recognised, and consequently reduce the cost for translation substantially. Successful development of a 'Simplified Medical/Cochrane English' and related writing aid tools could also constitute an investment in a product that Cochrane could sell to other health content developers, i.e. there is a possibility for investment return. In summary, we recommend that the Collaboration develops and adopts a 'Simplified Medical/Cochrane English' and develops writing aid tools for Cochrane content as a key point and necessity to facilitate a comprehensive translation strategy across the Collaboration. We acknowledge that this would constitute an important strategic choice for the Collaboration, affecting the priorities of the various Cochrane core teams and entities. It would require joint and streamlined action across the Cochrane groups, and could not be considered a marginal project. By embracing and implementing the idea of moving towards Simplified English, the Collaboration would take an important step to a mind shift in terms of how it approach es global participation. It would reverse the predominant concept of international work environments, whereby the non- native English speakers have to make the main effort, and introduce an alternative concept in which both the native and non-native English-speakers are called on. The Collaboration should consider this an opportunity to take a leadership role in the area of translation and communication in health care, similar to the role it has as a leader in systematic review methods. 3. Translation methods We have identified five major methods for translations: Translation method Details Quality Resource implications 1. Professional translation (+ human validation) Pay a company specialised in medical translations, and editors specialised in the content area or methods. High in particular in terms of language and grammar, but due to our specialised content, human validation by content or methods experts is required. Highest cost compared to the other models, thus least sustainable. In addition to the cost for the company an d editors, the multi -step proc ess requires a high level of coordination . 2. Computer aided translation (CAT, e.g. D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu ) Pay translators and editors specialised in medicine/methods and capable of using CAT software. The most recent versio ns of CAT combine its output sequentially with machine translation (see below). High, especially when the software's translation memory has grown after a while to include many identical or similar sentences. Nonetheless, human validation by content or meth ods experts is required. High cost, but the price is graded depending on the number of repetitions, exact matches, fuzzy matches, etc. with content in the memory. The multi - step proc ess requires a high level of co ordination, but new te chnologies and software can facilitate some of that effort and reduce costs , e.g. linked data or memoQ . OPEN ACCESS 3. Machine translation (without human validation) Use automated software. Many free or paid for online or desktop solutions exist. Lowest compared to the other models, but depending crucially on the software's translation memory and the complexity of the original content. Software can be trained with existing Cochrane or health content translati ons, which will increase the quality greatly, especially as a lot of Cochrane's content is repeating the same sentence structures and has a relatively limited and specialised vocabulary. Low cost and long term solution. Cost implications mainly for develo ping the software and the translation corpora, if there isn't sufficient translated content available. 4. Machine translation + human validation Use automated software, and paid for or volunteer editors specialised in the content area or methods. Very go od, likely better than option 1. Moderate, but much lower than option 1 and less than option 2. Compared to option 3, there is an increased need and cost for co -ordination, infrastructure , and the editors if paid . 5. Collaborative network of volunteers The Wikipedia principle: provide the infrastructure for a network of volunteers, a social community, where everyone can contribute as much or little as they like. Likely to vary, but probably good, as it can be presumed that mostly committed people would contribute and correct each other. Style guides , glossaries and training may facilitate more standardised results. There may be a risk that conflicted people try and modify evidence, so there is need for some kind of central control mechanism and/or initi al qualification examination of each volunteer. Low cost, but also unreliable. Costs mainly for setting up and maintaining the infrastructure. Translation projects may apply various combinations of any of these five approaches in order to increase efficiency and quality. We recommend that the Collaboration, directly and through pertinent alliances, works towards a combined approach of methods 2, 3, 4 and 5, and offers three quality levels of Cochrane translations: 1. Automatic translation by Cochrane trained software (CAT and/or machine translation) + human validation by paid editors who are content or methods experts. The Collaboration OPEN ACCESS would assume the editorial cost and commit to guaranteeing immediateness regarding the publication in different prioritised languages. 2. Automatic translation by Cochrane trained software (CAT and/or machine translation) + human validation by volunteers (similarly to Epistemonikos ' approach to translation, see Appendix 2 ). 3. Automatic translation by Cochrane trained software (CAT and/or machine translation)only without any validation Depending on the resources available, we could start, for example, by providing level 1 translations for prioritised abstracts or PLS only, and most other Cochrane content in level 2 and 3 translations. The different levels of translation would need to be designated clearly next to the translated content, and disclaimers should accompany at least level 2 and 3 translations. Level 1 should aim at providing the same quality as the English original. We should consider providing an option for people to consult the English version in parallel to the translated version. This could serve as a control mechanism and allow users to feedback in case of translation errors. A schematic illustration of the proposed approach is provided in Appendix 3 . The success of this approach is dependent on the following factors: Original content in Simplified English to foster the performance and quality of automatic and human translation. Dedicated software with reliable memory for the languages that we are providing translations for, i.e. fed with existing translation corpora. Corpora are ideally Cochrane content translations and Cochrane glossaries, but can also be related healthcare/methods content that may be available at a cost or free of charge (e.g. the CONSORT statement is available in 11 languages16). Research may help identify what minimum size of corpora is required to achieve a certain quality level. Development of user-friendly software and infrastructure to support translation processes, management and publication, including in particular the validation by paid editors and volunteers. Operative research is very much necessary in this area in order to develop and evaluate the possible options, taking into account that applicability may vary depending on the language. Some research with Cochrane involvement is already on-going or planned. For example, Philippe Ravaud has submitted a grant proposal for a research project on automatic translation for medical content, Simplified English and writing aids for French, Spanish and German (in collaboration with QUARTET M, see above). The proposal is available upon request. Gabriel Rada is also assessing the validity of Spanish translations produced by the translators' network of Epistemonikos and the editors of the Iberoamerican Cochrane Centr e. 4. Organis ational issues and infrastructure a. Central co-ordination As the main focus in terms of translation should be on Cochrane Review content and its derivatives, translations should fall under the responsibility of the Cochrane Editorial Unit and the Editor- in- Chief. To be able to manage translations effectively, we recommend that the Collaboration considers employing a full time Cochrane Translation Co-ordinator, accountable to the Editor- in-Chief. This person would then also liaise with the COU, Web Team, Wiley's media team, the Training and Methods Co-ordinators with regards to translation of Cochrane content other than reviews. Central co-ordination and implementation of a Cochrane translation strategy must be led by a non-native 16 See http://www.consort-statement.org/consort-statement/translations/ . OPEN ACCESS English speaker, who can fully grasp the issue, or should at least involve non-English speakers as consultants on a regular basis. b. Translation work flows and data repositories The Collaboration is currently providing the Translation Exchange in Archie as a means to manage translations of Cochrane abstracts and PLS and to publish them on The Cochrane Library and Cochrane Summaries. While this is an important improvement compared to the previous situation where there was no central infrastructure available and no possibility to publish translations of Cochrane Reviews on Cochrane websites, the Collaboration needs to continue improving and expanding translation work flows and infrastructure. Issues to be addressed include: Expand the Translation Exchange to support translation of content beyond the abstract and PLS; and provide translation management and publication systems for content which could not be efficiently handled via Archie. Improve the usability of the Translation Exchange and expand on its functions, in collaboration with the groups using it, to help rationalise and facilitate translation processes and management. Create better links and integration between our content databases (e.g. Archie for reviews) and external translation systems to reduce the number of steps involved in producing and publishing a translation. Develop a more efficient system to help manage updates of translations. At the moment, around 100 reviews are republished with amendments or updates every month. A portion of these is amended or updated while they are still being translated. Managing the updates and amendments of reviews that have already been translated before, is very time and cost intensive. Therefore, we need to provide a system that supports this endeavour effectively. The same applies to any other types of content: We need to be able to track and act upon easily, when a translation does not match the original content anymore. Create and maintain a database of past and on-going translation activities to be able to track projects, to avoid duplication, and to use the information for marketing purposes - who is doing what, and where is it available. Explore if this can be automated to a certain extent. c. Translations in the context of the Linked Data project The Collaboration is currently exploring a linked data approach to software development and content management. The Translation Working Group and prototype Translation Exchange have accomplished a lot, but face limitations due to the \"silo\" development pattern of our current systems. All technical teams are involved, Wiley, IMS, Web Team, Update Software, and there is even the potential to involve high-priority partners such as Epistemonikos and EROS . While linked data technologies are not the only option for improving translation work flows, they offer a potentially elegant solution to translation management in the complex Cochrane environment. Linked data features that would foster translation efforts include: A service-oriented architecture that would facilitate communication and interoperability between the software and data stores of the Collaboration, Wiley and external organisations (i.e. the providers of translations, translation software or writing aids ). A focus on user stories as a software development tool, which would allow specific identified translation needs to be addressed in a coordinated way by the various Collaboration or Wiley software teams whose involvement is needed. An ontology model that would allow Cochrane Reviews and their included studies to be broken down into components would facilitate translation and publication of specific portions of a review only. Translation could be made a first-order, high-priority project within the implementation of linked data for Cochrane. The aim would be to fix the current problems with translations in a way that OPEN ACCESS works for all of the various players while also serving as a pilot project for the agile development approach that is being identified in the Cochrane Linked Data Project. d. Publication and presentation of translations The Collaboration should aim at publishing all available translations in any language, including English, on a common platform, featuring a user- friendly interface, search and browse in all available languages. Easy navigation between the different languages must be ensured. This recommendation aligns with the Cochrane Content Publication & Delivery Programme and the new Publishing Agreement. It should be noted that there is a difference between a multilingual search engine that can return results in multiple languages at the same time, and a search and browse function for different languages (as it is implemented on Cochrane Summaries for example), that only returns results for one specific language at a time. To our knowledge, multilingual search engines are currently difficult to implement and maintain, and consequently much more expensive as the latter solution. It should be a requirement that any translations of Cochrane content, regardless of who performs them, must be published on dedicated Cochrane platforms; in addition, they may be published on Cochrane external sites, but only where it can be guaranteed that they are kept up to date and that the Collaboration's open access or license agreements are applied. Automated feeds to external sites, rather than independent and unlinked publication, would permit easy tracking. Translations of different types of content may be published on different platforms, e.g. training materials in various languages on the Cochrane Training website . However, we should set up language portals guiding speakers of a certain language to all content available in their language and at the same time link prominently from one platform to another. e. Marketing for translations Existing Cochrane translations are currently not promoted or used for marketing in any strategic way. A central marketing and dissemination strategy for translations would increase the usage of our content in non-English speaking countries. Furthermore, the availability of translations in certain languages puts us in a much better position for attracting funders from non-English speaking countries. In this context, we also recommend that the Collaboration works with Wiley to offer license or funding models in non-English speaking countries that take into account that the service and product currently provided cannot be considered the same than that in an English-speaking country: If a funder or subscriber, theoretically, has to provide the resources to translate the content into a different language to make them accessible in its region, then it shouldn't be charged the same price as a funder or subscriber in an English-speaking country. Nonetheless, subscriptions in non-English speaking regions should always include access to both the English and translated content, possibly to the entire multilingual platform without any language restrictions. f. SOPs and policies A strategic approach to translations should involve the development of official guidelines, standards and policies. These should cover copyright issues, publication permissions and decision-making, ensure certain quality standards and procedures, but also provide guidance to people interested or involved in translations and enable building on the experience of past or on-going projects. The following items should be considered: Update the translation section of the Policy Manual to reflect the state of the art. What content can be translated, how can someone get permission, where must/can translations be published, who owns the copyright, etc. Develop quality standards and minimum requirements for Cochrane translations. For example, experience from the French and Spanish teams revealed very clearly that even OPEN ACCESS translations from professional companies specialised in medical translations require validation by content and/or methods experts. Develop standard operating procedures on how to process and act on translation interest inquiries to enable quick and clear responses. g. International communication Even though this goes probably beyond the scope of this proposal, we recommend that the Collaboration builds on and implements the required actions identified at the Split Strategic Session regarding language support for authors whose first language is not English, and helps Centres facilitate the communication between non-English speaking authors and CRGs in order to increase acceptance and inclusiveness. 5. Potential types of content to translate Cochrane Reviews are our main product, and that should also be the priority of our translation efforts, along with material promoting our reviews. Assuming, however, we have good infrastructure and processes in place, and enough resources available, so that we can guarantee high-quality translations, the Collaboration could consider translating some or all of the following types of Cochrane content: Cochrane reviews and the platforms on which they are published (The Cochrane Library, Cochrane Summaries) including web interface, browse and search. The focus should be on title, abstract, and PLS. The CEU could be consulted to identify other review sections that should be prioritised, if sufficient resources are available for a specific language. A strategy for inviting, and replying to, feedback in languages other than English, and translating feedback into different languages, needs to be developed. Cochrane apps. When we develop apps, we need to ensure that they have the capability to support the multilingual Cochrane content platforms that we aim to implement, not only the English version. Content on cochrane.org. We should focus on key sections (e.g. Getting involved, About Us, impact stories, news features, blogs), and rather than approaching it as a copy of cochrane.org, we should create language specific portals, which guide users of a specific language to all Cochrane content available in this language. Podcasts. A total of 52 podcasts is available in other languages17 on cochrane.org , however they are very difficult to find, and there is no co-ordinated approach to translation, they are often initiated by the authors of the related reviews themselves. Cochrane videos (promotional). Translated subtitles would be a cheaper and faster option than translated audio, although automatic voice-detection and translation, as offered for example by YouTube and Google Translate, is also an option to explore further. The Cochrane Library press release and editorials. Derivative products (Cochrane Journal Club, Evidence Aid, Special Collections, Dr Cochrane, Cochrane Clinical Answers). Training materials (standard author training materials, online learning modules, etc.). The need and demand for translation of these materials is likely to vary in different languages and should be investigated before investing into it. Non-English speaking Centres and other entities should be consulted for advice. On the other hand, Non-English speaking entities may be interested to participate in this translation activity, or contribute their own materials, as training is one of their core functions. Guides and manuals (Cochrane Handbook, MECIR Standards, editorial resources and checklists, etc.). Similarly to training materials above, the need and demand for translation 17 11 different languages are available, but only 1-9 podcasts per language. There is a total of 309 English podcasts. OPEN ACCESS of guides and manuals is likely to vary in different languages. The Handbook and MECIR have been translated into Spanish, the Handbook also into Simplified Chinese. Reports of trials in languages other than English (for use by review authors). Data extraction from non-English trial reports is currently relying on a network of Cochrane volunteers with a Translator role in Archie who are approached by the review authors on a case by case basis. The Collaboration could consider funding central translation of trial reports into English or financially rewarding the efforts of the volunteers. Colloquia (content of website, simultaneous translation). The need or requirement for Colloquia related translations will be different every year, as the Colloquium is held in a different country every year; the majority of organisers have not provided any translations, and those who have, have assumed the cost from their overall budget. Event Manager supports multilingual web pages. The Collaboration may want to consider contributing to the cost of Colloquia translation, where there is a critical local need. Official documents (policies, minutes).While translation of official documents could constitute a statement of transparency, it may be rather low priority within the translation project, as it is unlikely to generate a lot of interest. Translation of these documents could be assumed by interested people or entities. 6. Into which languages should Cochrane content be translated? The decision on which languages should be prioritised is largely dependent on three factors: available funding, potential investment return, and existing Cochrane translations in a certain language. With the new Publishing Arrangement, Wiley has committed to providing a multilingual version of The Cochrane Library \"in the official languages of the World Health Organization (and other languages as agreed)\". Producing translations in the WHO languages other than English (Arabic, Chinese, French, Russian and Spanish) would be an important strategic choice which could open up new markets in Arabic countries, China, Russia and several Eastern European countries. To a certain extent, it might also put us into a better position on the Latin-American and Francophone markets, taking into account, that there is already a lot of material available in the se languages. However, this would require substantial and continuous investment into high-quality translations, in particular for Arabic, (Simplified) Chinese and Russian - languages for which we don't have any or very little Cochrane content available yet. For these three languages, the Collaboration should thus conduct research to gain more insight into the potential markets: how much return can we expect in terms of increased usage, and new license or funding agreements, and how does that relate to the investment cost for producing high-quality translations for these languages. Alternatively, or additionally, the Collaboration could priorities those languages where a substantial number of Cochrane translations already exist: Spanish, French, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, and maybe German. As explained under '3. Translation methods', a critical amount of existing Cochrane translations (or other corpora with Cochrane related content) is the basis required to facilitate automatic translation, which appears to be the most cost-effective and sustainable translation solution (in combination with paid for or volunteer human resources). Finally, a third approach to prioritisation could be based on to the likely impact and reach to potential contributors and users, i.e. the most widely spoken languages in the world18. But this approach would again require careful research on the market potential. It is important that the Collaboration ensures that the quality standards are the same across the different languages it prioritises, and that the same minimum set of content is translated for each of 18 See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers OPEN ACCESS them, for example it could be limited to the abstract, PLS and podcast of the reviews featured in the press release each month. Initiatives to translate content beyond the specified minimum set (e.g. by volunteers or external funders), should certainly be encouraged, even if that meant that the amount of available content differs from language to language. Similarly, the Collaboration should not discourage volunteer or external groups that wish to translate into a language that has not been prioritised by the Collaboration, provided they can adhere to our minimum standards and requirements. Such initiatives might provide valuable contributions to translation corpora and consequently support machine translation. 7. Funding Funding for translations has mostly been provided by national governments, public health organisations and associations to date. The Collaboration's sponsorship policy wouldn't allow for commercial funders due to potential conflicts of interest. Generally, the Collaboration is currently only addressing part of our potential audience and sponsors: we are providing services and content in English, but the vast majority of the world speaks different native languages. Providing translations in various languages would put us in a better position to attract new funders from non-English speaking countries, which may become even more important in view of the planned move to open access. The regular updates occurring with Cochrane content require regular updates to the translation as well, thus, continuous funding. However, the cost of traditional translation models is so high19, that it would be very difficult to find continuous funding for Cochrane translations in any language. All of the bigger translation projects had to \"take a break\" due to lack of funding at some point, or reduce the volume of their projects. We need to explore more sustainable and cost-effective models of translation (see section '3. Translation Methods') in order to reduce the cost, which will in turn put us in a better position to attract external funders and make it more affordable for ourselves to invest into translations. Rather than paying for professional translations into specific languages, the Collaboration should use its resources for investing into: the development of central infrastructure and software to support cost-effective translation models; research on and implementation of 'Simplified Medical/Cochrane English'; developing or buying translation corpora for priority languages where there don't exist any yet. The listed measures constitute a long-term investment towards any language, not only a specific one, and potentially into a product that we could sell to other organisations. Some Centres or other regional entities may be in a position to assume smaller tasks, e.g. translation of selected podcasts or training material. Nonetheless, and very importantly, the Collaboration should start seeking external funders or partners for translations proactively. Partnership or funding models could include Cochrane Library licenses, or joint research and software development projects, including the development of Simplified Medical English. Apart from the usual national public organisations and foundations, potential partners/funders include: The European Union; might be in particular interested, if we translate into its official and member state languages. WHO; might be interested in our content being available in its six official languages, and also buying translation software and memory, as they translate a lot of content into their official languages. 19The French and Iberoamerican Centres spend around 500,000 Euros annually. OPEN ACCESS World Bank; may have similar interests to the WHO. Academic or research groups, e.g. QUARTET M, Epistemonikos, Plain English Campaign ; may be interested in joint research projects and/or development of automatic translation and Simplified English tools specialised in health. IT or linguistic companies, e.g. Google Translate; may be interested in developing automatic translation and Simplified English tools specialised in health in collaboration with us. In this context, we should also think about good ways of acknowledging translation sponsors, for example by rewarding funders with some kind of presence on our websites. D.

We think that using CAT for a limited number of terms may improve accuracy, so we expect to implement it for research and statistical terminology. Using CAT for a broader amount of terms (e.g. medical terminology) does not seem an efficient alternative. (2) Epistemonikos is successfully doing this for Spanish using volunteers without formal training in translation (clinicians, senior students). Our translation experts provide continuous training and feedback to them. Several alternatives exist to boost the capacity of generating translations: partnering between Epistemonikos and Cochrane (collaborators engaged by Cochrane, using Epistemonikos ' platform); partnering with international initiatives (e.g. translators without borders, Google health translation project); using low cost human translation (e.g. mechanical turk). (3) We are not using any software in the validation, since the number of mistakes we have detected is negligible. Our team of translation experts consists of five people, plus content experts. Some alternatives to explore: professional translators, community translation (e.g. wiki), Cochrane Centres. (4) Translations are sent to one or two content experts. Changes in specialised terminology are frequent. Major mistakes are very rarely detected. (5) Tagged terms (key terms) are stored as linked data, which make them usable for search (e.g. taxonomic search, PICO search), to be used in other products, and for (many) future developments (see Example 1 below ).

Tagging Topical treatments for HIVrelated oral ulcers BACKGROUND: In HIV-infected adults , oral ulcers occur more frequently, last longer and produce more painful symptoms than in immunocompetent people. Oral aphthous ulcers observed during the course of HIV infection may be severe and can result in significant morbidity in these patients. Such manifestations may interfere with oral functions and alter patients' quality of life. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and side effects of topical agents used in the treatment of HIV- related o ral aphthous ulcers in adults. SEARCH METHODS: The following electronic databases were searched from the year 1980 to May 2011 for randomised controlled trials involving managements of oral ulcers, apthouses in HIV infected adults: EMBASE, PUBMED, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). SELECTION CRITERIA: Only randomised controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy of any topical agent in treating HIV oral aphthous ulcerations in HIV positive adults were considered. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed the potentially eligible studies for inclusion. We did not find any studies that meet our eligibility criteria. Therefore, no analysis was performed. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 233 abstracts were retrieved from the databases searched. None of the identified studies met our inclusion criteria. Ten of the studies identified were reports of systemic rather than topical treatment. Therefore, no studies were included in this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for well designed studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical agents for the treatment of HIV related oral aphthous ulcers. Generation of structured data (e.g. Population intervention, for PICO searches): Population/condition (main term): HIVrelated oral ulcers Secondary/subordinate/variant terms: HIV-infected HIV positive adults Oral ulcers Oral aphthous ulcers HIV-related oral aphthous ulcers oral ulcers, apthouses in HIV infected adults Intervention: Topical treatments OPEN ACCESS APPENDIX 3: Schematic illustration of three-fold translation approach Translated text officially validated Original version in English Translated text validated by volunteers Translated text without validation Xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx x xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx OPEN ACCESS Strategies for supporting and strengthen ing non-English language speakers' participation in The Cochrane Collaboration (CC) Purpose: To foster non-English language speakers active participation in the CC, to promote m ore consumer -oriented reviews with input from consumers in non -English language countries , to enhance the dissemination of the work of the CC to non- English language countries and to increase the acknowledgement of the value of consumer involvement. 1. Introduction Consumers are important for t he Collaboration, as they bring to the table the first hand experience of their illness and they represent both a repository of critical information on the needs of the patients and a valuable resource in the care plan. Needs and experiences vary around the world, so the Collaboration cannot afford the risk to lose the expertise, the experience and the ideas which come from consumers outside the Anglo- Saxon world. Involvement of n on-English speakers From Allen and Clarke, 2009: The Cochrane Collaboration \u00b7 over 22.000 people from 103 countries \u00b7 96/103 are countries where t English is not the first language \u00b7 13/17 Steering Group (SG) members are from countries where English is not the- first language Native English speakers are over represented at all levels in the CC: if, for the researchers/methodologists/authors international community, it is taken for granted a more than basic knowledge of English language, it is not the same for consumers. For this reason, developing strategies to overcome language barrier s is crucial to ensure a true active participation of consumers from non English language countries. A first attempt to address this imbalance, at least at the consumer's level, has been to establish the presence of a representative from non -English speak ing countries both in the Consumer Network Executive (CCNet - Exec) and if possible on the Collaboration SG Barriers and difficulties experienced by non- English language consumers 1. Lack of support/mentoring 2. Lack of funding 3. Lack of coordination 4. Lack of rec ognition of their role 5. Obvious difficulties in communicating 2. Proposed Strategies: 1. Support/mentoring \u00b7 Each National Cochrane Centre can try and play a central role as it can enroll, promote, help, and coordinate local consumers, whose problems, difficult ies, needs are different according to the different settings (language, country, culture, society, English knowledge, level of development of consumerism). Mostly, if they can translate Cochrane documents, Plain Language Summaries (PLSs) and, where possibl e, relevant Cochrane reviews, this would help considerably \u00b7 Identify Cochrane Centres or entities where consumer work is well recognized to provide possible models of participation, r ecognizing there is no single model for successful consumers involvement \u00b7 At the Steering Group level a robust intervention seems necessary. One possibility, although expensive and not easy to implement is, to prepare simultaneous translations with an interpreter during the SG meetings and, possibly, during the two face- to -face CCNet Exec meetings (Colloquium and mid- year) appears to be a unique solution. This will represent a great cultural investment that will increase participation in and the dissemination of Cochrane products worldwide. Confidentiality would need to be assured, and the processes used for professional interpreters are presumably already available. OPEN ACCESS 2. Funding \u00b7 It is proposed that Centres might take responsibility and request from funders a dedicated budget to refund/support consumers \u00b7 Inclusion of consumers/ patients/ citizens training issues in research proposal budgets, looking at this as an added value to the research proposals \u00b7 Simultaneous translations, as proposed above, will need funding. 3. Co-ordination \u00b7 Establish a support group for non -English consum ers, to provide language and coordination support for consumer activities including training. \u00b7 Identify consumer representatives from National Centres to be enrolled in CCNet Geographical Advisory Group (GAG) and develop diversified teams of consumers to produce and promote access to Cochrane reviews/PLS \u00b7 Provide introductory or special online training for non- English speaking consumers \u00b7 Support local and regional meetings that invite/include consumers. 4. Recognition of their role \u00b7 Reconsider the multi -faceted roles of patients/citizens/consumers \u00b7 Accept the consumers speak up for themselves, not through or by other persons 5. Difficulties in communicating \u00b7 Avoid a paternalistic attitude \u00b7 Overcome consumer's belief they are not listened to even when they are invited and involved in discussion \u00b7 Seek funds for simultaneous translation of meetings/symposia held in English when non-English speaking consumers are invited to attend/participate We would like the CCSG to consider these proposals, in order to support wi der meaningful consumer participation in The C ochrane Collaboration.

In addition, the Consumers' Executive had two temporary working groups formed with each participating in an additional conference c all during this period. iv) Descriptive summary: PLEACS -The PLEACS group concluded a year -long Delphi decision -making process which involved a dedicated group of consumers, methodologists, MEs, Co -ordinating Editors, Managing Editors and representatives from the Central Editorial Unit. Through a collaborative process with Cochrane OPEN ACCESS Review stakeholders, mandatory standards for plain language summaries were finalized in February 2013. The standards for PLS will be implemented alongside the MECIR standards according to a schedule that will be presented at the Mid -Year Meeting. The MECIR standards, including the new standards for PLS, will be printed for the Collaboration as a booklet of recommendations which can accompany the Cochrane Handbook. The next portion of the PLEACS project will see the larger working group divided into two smaller groups with different purposes. To aid implementation of the standard, the first group will focus on format recommendations (i.e. the look and feel of the PLS), whil e the second group will design tools and guidance materials for Authors and Managing Editors to utilize the standards. An update on the progress of these two groups will follows in the next report. Cochrane Summaries - A new website, now live for the publ ic, presents consumers with an innovative way to find the information they need in Cochrane reviews. For the first time, all plain language summaries and abstracts on Cochrane Summaries have the resource of a built -in glossary that automatically highlights and defines technical terms and jargon as you read. In addition, search terms are mapped to a drug name database which provides consumers with the generic and brand names for the drug term for which they are searching. Any drug or disease, regardless of any misspelling, will instantly redirect the user to the relevant Cochrane Review. Several of these and other features will be revealed in the time leading up to the Mid -Year meeting to promote use of the site. Additional information about t he Collaboration, Cochrane Reviews, and evidence -based medicine has been written in plain language to promote the site to non -Cochranites. [Only new features developed in 2013 have been described in this update.] This website was built through the combined effort of Chris Mavergames, Martin Janczyk, Lorne Becker and Catherine McIlwain. Visit 'Cochrane Summaries ' at http://summaries.cochrane.org for all the latest information. Cochrane Referee Training P lan - Cochrane Training now boasts training options for consumers to learn about everything from clinical trials to systematic reviews. Caroline Struthers and Catherine McIlwain have created an inventory of choices for consumers to educate themselves or get involved. Buildi ng on this development, the Cochrane Summaries and CCNet web pages now direct users to the Consumers tab on the Cochrane Training website for more information about all things Cochrane. See what you can learn at http://training.cochrane.org/consumers . Six new e-learning modules are being developed by Caroline Struthers which are adapted from the training videos of the ALOIS engagement project (alois.cochrane.org). Work on the modules is being supervis ed by Catherine McIlwain to ensure that they target a more general consumer audience . By the end of March 2013, these new training modules will be released as the first tier of the c onsumer training program . After the Mid -Year meeting, the revised ALOIS mo dule will be added to this site as part of a larger outreach project for The Cochrane Consumer Network. ECRAN - Part of an international partnership, CCNet has been awarded a grant to promote public education about and involvement in clinical trials. CCN et's involvement in the project has led to the creation on an online database of consumer educational tools, websites and other communications OPEN ACCESS devices which will be made available through a multi- lingual audience. The search engine will function in the si x WHO languages, and the online interface will feature each flag from the European Union with translated interfaces in several languages. The project has successfully completed the first 6 months work, and following a positive review by the project office r, we will be awarded an additional 18 months of work. 3.

What were your main activities? What were your challenges and achievements? Are there any important updates that the Steering Group should be aware of? OPEN ACCESS At the Paris meeting in A pril 2012 the Fields' Executive set the priority for the upcoming year to be supporting and mentoring potential or existing Fields. This work was carried out during this period as follows: 1. We worked with Dr Mario Tristan of the Developing Countries Field. In particular, our MaRC representative, Susan Wieland, maintained contact with Dr Tristan in an effort to advise him on carrying out Field core functions. 2. Denise Thomson and Susan Wieland had an informal meeting with Drs. Bruce Arroll and Tim Kenealy of the Primary Health Care Field in Auckland in October 2013, to discuss the Field's functioning and how the Fields' Executive can best support its activities. All sides felt this was a productive and useful conversation. 3. Following on the success of the meeti ng with the Primary Health Care Field, we have scheduled similar conversations with the Directors and staff of the Health Care of Older Persons Field and the Justice Health Field, in March and May 2013, respectively. 4. We established a website for Fields Dir ectors and staff ( www.fieldsexec.cochrane.org ). This website will be maintained and stocked with resources on an ongoing basis. 3. OBJECTIVE PLANNING i) For the next reporting period and beyond: Objective /activity Planned output Timeline and comments Training and mentoring procedures for Field entity staff Continued work on training and mentoring materials for Fields staff. Mentoring program in place; training materials finalised. We have developed mat erials and have plans in place for support and mentoring for all Fields.

The minutes of the meetings have been shared with the TSCs' and Co- Eds' Executives and have been shared with MEs. Expenditure We have been allocated an annual budget of \u00a310,000 and have agreed with the Co- Chairs of the SG that funds not spent in the previous financial period can be rolled over. We are within our budgeted spend for this period but the expenses for the Oxford meeting in March 2013 have not yet been submitted. When these monies have been reconciled we will consider if we are able to offer any financial assistance for any members of the Executive who do not have the funding to attend the annual Colloquium meetings. OPEN ACCESS Activities of the MEs' Executive during the reporting period We continue to ensure that MEs are represented on Collaboration committees relevant to the role of the ME, providing support if needed. Karin agreed to represent the MEs' Executive on the Workshop Committee for the Quebec Colloquium. Emma agreed to represent MEs at the MECIR meeting concerning review updates. Liz has become the C o-convenor of ADAC with Chris. Liz's first term on the MEs' Executive was up in February 2013, Liz indicated her wish to continue for a second term and in accordance with the remit of the Executive this was agreed by the Chair. We are grateful to Liz for her continued commitment. Six members attended the Colloquium in Auckland, O ctober 2012. We have actively participated on the MEs ' Discussion Forum and responded to queries and requests for information where appropriate. Sally continues to act as the day to day line manager for the role of Executives Support Officer (ESO) on behalf of the CRG Executives and undertook a six month review of the role and its present incumbent, Vicki Pennick. This was done in collaboration with all CRG Executive convenors. Feedback from Vicki along with the Exec review was discussed at a meeting of the CRG Executive convenors in Auckland. Post Colloquium Sally gave Vicki the views of the convenors on the progression of the role to date which was positive and supportive. It was agreed the position was valuable and should continue subject to funding being made available. We have worked with the ESO to harmonise the MEs mailing list and the ME Forum membership. We are continuing to work on the ME Portal for Cochrane.org. Sally participated in the recruitment of the Copy Edit Support (CES) Manager whic h included shortlisting, preparing interview questions and attending the interviews along with representatives of the CEU and Wiley. The outcome was the successful recruitment of a new CES Manager. OPEN ACCESS The Executive have established a good working relationshi p with the new ME Support team and Harriet Maclehose as ME Support Manager.

WORKPLAN UPDATE The purpose of the Author Forum is to facilitate communication and productive linkages between Authors , the Cochrane Collaboration Steering Group , the Office of the Editor in Chief, Cochrane Executives, subgroups and w orking groups, with a view to achieving the mission of The Cochrane Collaboration. i) Terms of Reference: To identify collective Author concerns and issues and bring them forward to the appropriate parties. To identify priorities for improving the authorship process. To bring the expertise of experienced Author s into the strategic thinking of The Cochrane Collaboration and to influence the development of The Cochrane Library . To oversee, engage with and participate in, working groups that can operationalise these priorities. To identify key linkages within The Cochrane Collaboration, including methodologists and CRG staff. OPEN ACCESS To provide a vehicle to communicate the perspective of Authors to the Steering Group Author Representative, the Office of the Edito r in Chief, Cochrane Executives, Cochrane infrastructure support systems and other working groups. To provide advice and support to the CCSG Author representative and Editor in Chief. To represent Author s and actively participate in CCSG subgroups and ot her working groups where appropriate. To assist in filling of Author positions within subgroups and working parties. To help develop and maintain communication pathways with Author s. iii) What we have achieved up to now: To bring the expertise of experie nced Author s into the strategic thinking of The Cochrane Collaboration and to influence the development of The Cochrane Library: The Forum provided the Training Working Group, the Web Team and the Workshop Committee of the Colloquium with advice with rega rd to Authors' perspectives in their projects. To identify collective Author concerns and issues and bring them forward to the appropriate parties. We are continuously discussing important issues around Author involvement in The Cochrane Collaboration. Th e discussions started with the recommendations from the previous Author survey and the major topics that we had identified were as follow: 1) Strategies to improve the communication between Authors and The Cochrane Collaboration and reducing the barriers to e ngagement (both for new Authors and experienced Authors): It has been recognized that this issue has multiple perspectives and cannot be addressed by one simple strategy. Moreover, it is important that new processes wouldn't unnecessary increase workload o r cause anxiety and tension between groups. One of the strategies that we are currently focusing on is technological strategies to improve communication and engagement with Authors. This was also based on the increasing investment of the Collaboration in a number of similar projects. We are working and participating in the work of the Web Team to identify the best web - based strategies to improve engagement with the Authors; this includes an Author -centred portal (http://authors.cochrane.org ). In our collaboration with the Web Team, we recognized that several projects identified by the Web Team address some of the recommendations of the Author survey. 2) Authorship on Updates: The lack of clear policies around authorship has been raised by several members of the Forum. A working group along with members of the Cochrane Editorial Unit is currently working on a suggested draft on authorship of updates. 3) Non -English speakers: The difficulties of non -English Authors to kee p up with the complex language of the methodological documents has been raised and communicated with the Methods G roup Co -ordinator. 4) Mentorship in the C ollaboration: OPEN ACCESS The m entorship program has been part of the training program of different Cochrane entities or research groups working with in The Cochrane Collaboration. Despite the known success of some of these initiatives like the HIV/AIDS mentoring program, there was not a systematic approach across the Collaboration to collect information on th is mento rship program delivered by different Cochrane entities and to develop a strategic approach to it. We established a mentorship working group including different members of the C ollaboration to plan the best approach to address this issue. The planned approa ch is a survey with all Authors in the Collaboration along with interviews of a sample of them. It became the clear that the project requires further administrative support to go forward. ii) Costs and Expenditure: The Author Forum currently doesn't rec eive any direct funding from The Cochrane Collaboration. The Editorial Unit has kindly agreed to provide the Forum with the possibility for teleconferences during the year and support from their staff. In addition to this, the Web Team recognized the impor tance of using technology to improve Author experiences in engaging with Authors; Caroline Mavergames is supporting us in this regard. iii) Meetings, teleconferences and other communication: Face to face meetings - None Teleconferences -- 11 Oct 2011, 9 A ugust 2012, 26 Nov 2012, 1 March 2012, 14 Feb 2013. We are currently discussing with the Web Team to make the minutes of all the teleconferences available online. We hope they will be available before the mid -year meetings. 3. FUNDING AND/OR POLICY DECISI ON REQUESTS The Author Forum has been established with the valuable support of the Editor in Chief and his staff. It would be preferable for the long- term sustainability of the Author Forum that there would be a certain number of teleconferences along with administration support allocated to the Author Forum. We also request that administrative support for the Author Forum would be considered as part of the future plans of the newly appointed CEO to develop a supportive operative structure for the Collabora tion. The administration support would include preparing and sending a newsletter to the Author list on the most important Author -relevant topics (as identified by the Author Forum), preparing and maintaining the content of the Author website (http://autho r.cochrane.org), conducting Author surveys at regular intervals e.g. every three years to identify challenges and concerns that Authors face and finally supporting the Forum with important identified projects e.g. mentorship survey. In order to encourage i ncreased involvement of Author representatives from non-English background, copy editing support in preparing documentation and reports would be appreciated.
