An extensive clinical and investigational evaluation revealed chronic consumption of multiple herbal medications that led to this condition. This case report is published in the Oxford Medical Case Reports, 2022, published by [Oxford University Press](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/oxford-university-press) . However, practitioners of traditional medicines termed these allegations baseless. \"There is no truth in these allegations. Ayurveda is time tested and has positive benefits on people's health. Allopathy has the maximum side effects but modern medicine practitioners are silent about it,\" Dr Vijayan Nangeli, president, Ayurveda Hospital and Management Association, and chairman of Ayush Aikya Vedi. As per the report, a young girl with jaundice and ascites, a condition in which fluid collects in spaces within the abdomen, in whom the liver histopathology was suggestive of severe alcoholic hepatitis with additional findings of dense fibrosis localized mostly to the portal regions of the liver. Genetic factors were ruled out through tests. An extensive clinical evaluation revealed chronic consumption of multiple [Ayurvedic](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ayurvedic) medications for seizure disease from the age of 9 years. The alternate medications were retrieved from the patient and subjected to extensive chemical and toxicology analyses. In-depth analysis of the retrieved agents, including state-of-the-art chemical and toxicology analyses, clinical exome studies, gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectroscopy (MS) studies, demonstrated multiple hepatotoxins associated with acute alcoholic- and arsenic poisoning-related hepatoportal sclerosis in the young girl. \"The girl had two kinds of liver injuries. Due to long use of ayurvedic medicines, with high alcohol content, led to alcoholic liver disease in the child. Secondly, presence of high amounts of arsenic led to non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. The biopsy also showed various degrees of liver inflammation mostly because of multi-herbal components,\" said Dr Cyriac Abby Philips of The Liver Institute, Center of Excellence in GI Sciences, Rajagiri Hospital, Aluva, who is the lead author. In the recent past, a \"toolkit\" was created against Dr Abby on social media and he was attacked professionally for his work on drug-induced liver injury. \"The use of complementary and alternative medicine is on the rise all over the world, with the assumption that these alternative drugs are safer and free from adverse effects. Though traditionally considered safe, better awareness of the identification and availability of sophisticated analytical methods have demonstrated an increased incidence of Ayurvedic drug-related liver injury among the general population, leading to acute liver failure and patients with chronic liver disease, resulting in acute on chronic liver failure,\" added Dr Abby.
