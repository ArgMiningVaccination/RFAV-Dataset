It is committed to equal education and employmentopportunities for men and women of all races and does not discriminate on the basis of handicap, gender, race, color, or national origin in its educational or admissionspolicies, financial affairs, employment programs, student life and services, or anyUniversity-administered program. Any student with a documented disability (e.g., physical, learning, or psychological) who needs to arrange reasonable accommodation must contact the dean, or designee, ofthe School of Public Health. All discussions will remain confidential. To this end, the University is in compliance with Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended, and in substantial compliance with Title IX of the EducationAmendments of 1972 (34 CFR 106 et seq.), Sections 503 and 504 of the RehabilitationDiscrimination in Employment Act of 1967, and Section 402 of the Vietnam Era VeteransAdjustment Act of 1974; and does not discriminate against any employees or applicantsfor employment on the basis of age or because they are disabled veterans or veterans ofthe Vietnam era. In addition, the University administers student programs without dis-crimination on the basis of age, except in those programs where age is a bona fide acade-mic qualification for admission in accordance with the provisions of the Age Discrimina-tion Act of 1975.

HEALTH Letter from the Dean Mission, Goals, and ValuesSchool FoundationsGeneral InformationAdmissions InformationFinancial InformationStudent LifeAcademic Policies and General Regulations18 SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Let me take this opportunity to welcome you to the Loma Linda University School of Public Health. I am excited that you have demonstrated an interest in academicpreparation for one of the world's most exciting careers. Our students and gradu- ates are engaged in a worldwide struggle with problems that shorten life, reduce the quali-ty of life, and consume valuable resources needed elsewhere. Air and water quality arepoor in much of the world, famine still exists, and thousands\u2014many of them children\u2014die each year from rampaging diseases such as choler, AIDS, dengue fever, and malnutri-tion. The sting of poverty still crushes three fifths of the world's population, which are forced to live on less than $2.00/day. Health disparities still plague our nation's minoritypopulations, bringing significant and premature loss of life and burden of illness. Public health maintains a preventive and population based approach to these prob- lems. We view our \"patients\" as whole communities. Loma Linda University's School ofPublic Health looks to prepare the next generation of Public Health leaders. We are look-ing for students who embrace critical thinking, who are not content with yesterday'sexplanations for today's questions, and who seek to make a difference in this world. We seek to understand the interplay between lifestyle and disease. We seek to make prevention of disease an art and a science. We strive to equip our students with the life-long tools they will need to combat the insidious forces on this planet that tend to robmen and women of hope, dignity and purposeful life. Our faculty will continue to refineour curriculum to keep it current with the needs of our profession. We will continue toexpect more of every graduate, just as a suffering world expects more from us all. But at the end of your academic journey, you will know that you are more than pre- pared to meet this global challenge with skill, grace, and understanding. I invite you to examine our various programs and degree offerings. Find the program that best matches your interest and join us for theadventure of a lifetime. Our campus will offer theadvantage of smaller class size, and thereby moreopportunity to interact with faculty. We have manyopportunities for our students to work in communi-ties, both locally and internationally. This is youropportunity to equip yourself for a life of serviceand meaning. We welcome you to our family. James Kyle, II, M.D., M.Div.

This relationship is reflected in the following values: Compassion toward fellow human beings, creatures, and nature Acceptance of each individual as a priceless child of God Respect for the beliefs, ideas, opinions, and cultures of others Equity in interactions with all individuals, races, ethnicities, and cultures Integrity by matching belief with action Faith in the outworking of God's ultimate purpose Wisdom in research, study, and service SCHOOL FOUNDATIONS 21 School Foundations HISTORY The School was begun in 1948 with the organization of the School of Tropical and Preventive Medicine, the purpose of which was to provide a base for research andteaching. After its reorganization in 1961, the Division of Public Health and Tropical Medicine began to offer master's degree programs through the Graduate School.Establishment of the School of Public Health was authorized in 1964, and plans weremade for faculty and facilities to meet the requirements of the Committee on ProfessionalEducation of the American Public Health Association. In 1967 the School of Nutrition andDietetics (which had been organized in 1922 as the School of Dietetics) became a depart-ment of the School of Public Health. The name of the School was changed to School ofHealth in October 1970. Because the meaning of the term \"public health\" has graduallybroadened to emphasize lifestyle\u2014consistent with the goals of the School\u2014the originalname, School of Public Health, was readopted in August 1987. The Center for HealthPromotion, the Department of Preventive Medicine, and the Preventive Medicine PracticeGroup were merged into the School of Public Health in 1990. This resulted in expandedfaculty and resources. The expanded School of Public Health also serves as theDepartment of Preventive Medicine in the School of Medicine. ACCREDITATION The School has maintained continuous accreditation since it was accredited at itsinception in 1967 by the American Public Health Association. It is currentlyaccredited by the Council on Education for Public Health, 800 Eye Street NW, Suite 202, Washington, D.C. 20001-1397 .

The student firstobtains direct-provider payment, or reimburse-ment for out-of-pocket payments, from all othermedical plans that provide benefits for the stu-dent; only then does the student submit bills tothe Student Health Plan for any remaining bal-ance not covered by the other plans. The studentmust, therefore, follow all rules of his/her primaryinsurance in obtaining medical treatment. Thestudent should contact the primary carrier todetermine what procedure to follow. Eligibility The Student Health Plan automatically covers all full-time students at Loma Linda University inany clinical or academic program. Students arecovered when enrolled for 7 units or more perquarter (or clock-hour equivalent, as defined byeach school) for which Loma Linda University isreceiving tuition enrolled for field practicum are eligiblefor coverage if registered for at least 240 hours perquarter. Coverage during clinicals /rotations Students who are accidentally injured while performing their clinical rotation duties do nothave to pay their co-payment. If a covered studentis doing a school-sponsored clinical or rotationout of the area and becomes ill or injured, anyhealth service and medical care received that iscovered by the Student Health Plan will still becovered as if the student were in the Loma Lindaarea. Effective coverage date An eligible student's coverage becomes effec- tive on the day of orientation or the first day ofclass. Any purchased benefits will become effec-tive on the day the Department of Risk Manage-ment receives the health plan application andpayment within the open enrollment period,which is only the first two weeks of each calendarquarter. Buy-in provision only during open enrollment Eligible students are themselves automatical- ly covered by the plan; however, noneligible stu-dents\u2014those on summer break and part-time 34 SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH students (e.g., in a clinical program but enrolled for fewer than 7 paid units)\u2014may, if they wish,purchase coverage. Those wishing to buy in may enroll in the Student Health Plan only during the first twoweeks of each new calendar quarter, that is, dur-ing the first two weeks of January, April, July, andOctober.

REGISTRATION AND ATTENDANCE Students may register online following consulta-tion with their advisers and assignment of an RAC (registration authorization code). Registrationis not completed until the student has obtainedfinancial clearance. Students engaged in graduatework must be duly registered at the time the studyis initiated and completed. No credit is granted foracademic work performed during any quarter with-out current registration. A change in registrationrequires filing a Change of Program form with theOffice of University Records. Registration foron-campus students takes place no later than theseventh calendar day of the quarter. Students receive written verification at registration and eachtime a change of program is officially approved.Students are advised to retain this written verifica-tion as documentation of their registration. Posted deadlines for registration and change of registration are in effect and binding. TheSchool will not intercede to obtain a variance. Religion courses Selection of religion courses to fulfill require- ments for the various degrees should be made inconsultation with the adviser, using the courseschedule published each quarter by the Office ofUniversity Records. Undergraduate students may meet the reli- gion requirement by enrolling in 400-level religioncourses. Graduate students are required to com-plete a 3-unit, 500-level religion course per degreesought. Religion-course credit applicable to a School of Public Health degree program must be graded by thetraditional letter grade system.

The religion requirementmay not be waived by registering for a religion courseat a university other than Loma Linda University. Convocation attendance Attendance at weekly University and quarterly School convocations is required. Unexcusedabsences are reported to the dean. Persistent failureto attend may jeopardize a student's regular standing. Course attendance Only duly registered students may attend classes. Students are expected to attend allappointments in a course. Absences in excess of15 percent may be sufficient cause for a failing orunsatisfactory grade to be recorded. Unit of credit Credit is granted in terms of the quarter unit, which represents ten-to-twelve contact hours per1 unit of didactic course credit\u2014together withrequisite study, preparation, and practice; a mini-mum of twenty contact hours for 1 unit of semi-nar credit; and a minimum of thirty contact hoursfor 1 unit of laboratory credit. All courses not listing academic credit in units must list credit in total hours of contact orclock hours.Academic Policies and General Regulations Students are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily complying with the policies and meeting the regulations pertinent to registration, matricula-tion, and graduation.ACADEMIC POLICIES AND GENERAL REGULATIONS 37 Graduate student course load On-campus students are considered to be in a full-time graduate program when they are registeredfor at least 8 units, although 12 units per quarter isconsidered to be a normal graduate course load.Students registered for a field practicum of at least400 hours are considered to be in a full-time pro-gram. Academic overloads are not encouraged, andthose students desiring to take an overload mustmeet certain academic criteria. The total academic and work load includes the number of credit units registered at this University;registration in field practicum, clerkship, internship,or residency through this University; the number ofcredit units (prerequisite or other courses) at anoth-er college or university; and the number of hours involunteer or gainful employment. Undergraduate student course load The normal course load, including all course work for which a student may be registered at thisor another institution, is 16 quarter units for anundergraduate student. An undergraduate student must be registered for at least 12 units to be considered full time. The total academic and work load includes the number of credit units registered at this University;registration in senior projects; the number of creditunits (prerequisite or other courses) at another col-lege or university; and the number of hours in vol-unteer or gainful employment. Non-LLU courses as part of total load for financial aid Correspondence, extension, independent study, and course work taken at any other institution con-stitute part of the student's study load. Only whenthe student enrolls in such courses using theConsortium Agreement form (from the Office ofFinancial Aid) will the course(s) count on the stu-dent's total load as eligible for financial-aid and loan-deferment purposes. A person who is not enrolled in regular classes but who is occupied in research, dissertation, or the-sis, is classified as a student. By filing an AcademicLoad Validation form every quarter at registration,the academic load may be validated for loan-defer-ment and immigration purposes. The student mustbe carrying IP (in progress) units or registered for aminimum of 1 new unit of research, dissertation, orthesis for the quarter. The academic work load iscounted as follows: full load\u2014minimum of 36 clock hours/weekthree-quarter load\u2014minimum of 27 hours/week one-half load\u2014minimum of 18 clock hours/week one-quarter load\u2014minimum of 9 clock hours/week. A student may simultaneously earn more than one baccalaureate degree, provided there is a mini-mum of 20 units unique to each degree and providedall other degree requirements are met. Academic overload Master's degree students registering for more than 15 units per quarter and undergraduate stu-dents registering for more than 18 units per quar-ter must obtain permission to do so by the associ- ate dean. Doctoral degree students do not requirespecial permission to do so as long as theapproved curriculum is followed and the G.P.A. ismaintained as indicated below. The following G.P.A. guidelines have been established for approval of overload requests. Atthe discretion of the associate dean, requests bygraduate students for 19 units and above, orundergraduate students for 22 units and above,may be referred to the School of Public HealthAcademic Council for approval. Cumulative G.P.A. Units allowed Bachelor's 2.9-3.1 20 above 3.2 21 Master's 3.3-3.4 16 3.5-3.75 17 above 3.75 18 Doctoral 3.5-3.75 17 above 3.75 18 Students accepted on a provisional basis or who are on academic probation are not eligible topetition for a course overload. Course audit Students in any admission classification may audit courses for purposes of supplementary educa-tion. This option is not available for predominantlylaboratory-experience courses. Consent to audit isgranted by the instructor, subject to classroomspace. A request to change an audit course to creditor credit to audit may be made no later than theseventh calendar day of a quarter. An audit coursemay not be repeated for credit. Extramural work When a student begins a degree program, it is understood that course work must be taken at thisUniversity unless, upon petition for extramuralwork, the student obtains prior consent from thedepartment for study at another institution. Insuch instances the student must arrange for evalua-tion of the work and, at its completion, recommen-dation as to credit. Since extramural work is a typeof transfer credit, all policy relating to transfercredit also applies to extramural credit. Transfer credit For undergraduate degree transfer-credit information, please refer to the entrance-requirements section in this BULLETIN . Appropriate graduate-level courses, to a maxi- mum of 9 quarter units for master's degree programsand 12 quarter units for doctoral degree programs,may be transferred into a School of Public Healthdegree program. These limits include transfer ofcredit earned before entry into the School of PublicHealth program, as well as extramural credit earnedduring the program. Courses must have been takenwithin the past five years at an accredited institu-tion, with a grade of B or better. Requests must beinitiated by the student, in consultation with theadviser and validated by the department chair. Just38 SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH as Loma Linda University does not guarantee trans- fer of its credits to other schools, we reserve the rightto deny transfer credit into our programs. For thisreason, it is always best for the student to requestadvance approval of any graduate courses s/he plansto take at another accredited university. Waiver Certain course requirements in a program may be waived on the basis of previously completedcourse work. Waiver of a specific course require-ment does not reduce the number of units requiredfor the program. Advanced academic standing Graduate students with previous course work in areas of public health may apply for limited units ofadvanced standing. If approved by the programdirector or department chair and the director ofadmissions and academic records in the School,degree requirements\u2014exclusive of elective units\u2014are reduced. Courses taken during the past five yearsare considered in an evaluation of the student's qual-ification for advanced standing. Competency incourses taken more than five years previously maybe considered if the content has been used profes-sionally on a regular basis. No advanced standing isgranted for life experience that is not in conjunctionwith previous course work. Advanced standing is notgranted for religion courses. Shared units The maximum number of units that may be shared between a doctoral and master's degree pro-gram within the University is 18 units. The maxi-mum number of units that may be shared betweena bachelor's and master's degree program withinthe University is 9 units. Shared units are notautomatically guaranteed. Independent study/special projects Independent study is offered to provide oppor- tunity for the student to gain academic experiencebeyond that which is available in regular coursework. Thus, it is seen neither as a substitute forother course requirements nor as a mechanism toobtain course work not currently scheduled.Master's degree students are restricted to 4 units ofindependent study/special projects within the unitsrequired for the degree. Doctoral degree studentsare restricted to 4 units of independent study/spe-cial projects per year or a maximum of 6 units forthe entire degree program. Credit by equivalency examination Credit for equivalency examinations is not accepted toward School of Public Health graduatedegrees. Equivalency examinations for graduatestudents may be used to challenge prerequisitesand to validate previous training for advancedstanding or waiver requests. Equivalency examina-tions may be accepted for School of Public Healthundergraduate degrees. Requests for equivalency examination(s) must be approved by the current instructor of the coursefor which request is made, as well as by the student'sdepartmental faculty. Equivalency examination(s)must be scheduled four weeks prior to the quarter inwhich the course(s) for which waiver is requested is offered. The student must pay the designated equiva-lency-examination fee prior to the examination. Special examination Except in unusual circumstances beyond the immediate control of a student, requests for specialexaminations are not granted. A student requestinga special examination must complete an academicvariance form, obtain the instructor's signature,and pay a fee. SCHOLASTIC STANDING Grades and grade points The following grades and grade points are used in this University. Each course taught in this Schoolhas been approved for either a letter grade or an S/Ugrade, and deviations from this are not allowed. A 4.0 Outstanding performance. A- 3.7B+ 3.3B 3.0 Very good performance for undergraduate credit; satisfactoryperformance for graduate credit. B- 2.7C+ 2.3C 2.0 Satisfactory performance for undergraduate credit. C- 1.7 Unacceptable performance.D+ 1.3D 1.0 Minimum performance for which undergraduate credit isgranted. F 0.0 Failure\u2014given for not meeting minimal performance. S none Satisfactory performance\u2014count- edtoward graduation. Equivalent to a C grade or better in under-graduate courses, or a B grade orbetter in graduate courses. An Sgrade is not computed in thegrade-point average. A student may request a grade of S in only a limited amount ofcourse work as determined bythe school. This is done by thestudent's filing with the Office ofUniversity Records the appropri-ate form prior to fourteen calen-dar days before the final exami-nation week. Once filed, thegrade is not subject to change. U none Unsatisfactory performance \u2014 given only when performance for an S-specified course fallsbelow a C grade level in anundergraduate course or a Bgrade level in a graduate course.Similar filing procedures asgiven above are required. The Ugrade is not computed in thegrade-point average.SCHOLASTIC STANDING 39 S/N none Satisfactory performance in a clock-hour course. Not includedin total units. Same gradingcriteria as the S grade given fora credit-hour course. U/Nnone Unsatisfactory performance in a clock-hour course. Not includedin total units. Same grading cri-teria as the U grade given for acredit-hour course. CR none Credit earned for Credit by Examination. Counted towardgraduation/units earned, but notunits attempted. Such creditcannot be counted for financialaid purposes. NC none No credit for unsatisfactory per- formance for a Credit by Exami-nation. Does not count for anypurpose. Notations W Withdrawal \u2014given for withdrawal from a course prior to fourteen calendar daysbefore the final examination week.Withdrawals during the first fourteen cal-endar days of a quarter or the first sevencalendar days of a summer session arenot recorded if the student files with theOffice of University Records the appro-priate form prior to the cut-off date.Withdrawals outside this time frame,upon recommendation of the dean, maybe removed at the discretion of the vicepresident for academic affairs. In the case of nontraditionally scheduledcourses, W will be given for withdrawalfrom a course prior to completion of 80percent of the course, excluding the finalexamination period. Withdrawals duringthe first 20 percent of a course, excludingthe final examination period, are notrecorded if the student files with the Officeof University Records the appropriate formprior to the date when this 20 percent ofthe course is completed. UW Unofficial Withdrawal \u2014indicates that the student discontinued class attendanceafter the close of registration but failed towithdraw officially. I Incomplete \u2014given when the majority of the course work has been completed andcircumstances beyond a student's controlresult in the student being unable to com-plete the quarter. An I notation may bechanged to a grade only by the instructorbefore the end of the following term(excluding the summer sessions for thosenot in attendance during that term).Incomplete units are not calculated in thegrade-point average. By the use of the petition form, the stu- dent requests an I notation from theinstructor, stating the reason for the request and obtaining the signatures of theinstructor, the department chair, and theassociate dean. The form is left with theinstructor. The instructor will then reportthe I notation on the grade-report form, aswell as the grade that the student willreceive if the deficiency is not removedwithin the time limit. The petition form isthen filed with the Office of UniversityRecords along with the grade-report form. The notation I is not granted as a remedy for overload, failure on final examination,absence from final examination for otherthan an emergency situation, or a lowgrade to be raised with extra work. IP In Progress\u2014indicates that the course has a duration of more than a single term andwill be completed by the student no laterthan the final term of the course, not toexceed five quarters for independentstudy and research courses (original quar-ter of registration plus four additionalquarters). The student's final grade will bereported on the instructor's grade reportat the end of the term in which the courseis completed. If the course work is notcompleted within the five-quarter timelimit, a grade of U will be given. AU Audit\u2014indicates registration for atten- dance only, with 80 percent class atten-dance considered a requirement. Arequest to change a credit course to auditor an audit course to credit may be madeno later than the fourteenth calendar dayafter the beginning of a quarter or theseventh calendar day after the beginningof the summer session. (This does notaddress short summer courses lastingonly a week or two.) AUW Audit Withdrawal\u2014given for withdraw- ing from the course or to indicate thatthe 80 percent class attendance require-ment was not observed. Each course taught in the School of Public Health has been approved for either a letter gradeor an S/U grade, and deviations from this are notallowed. Grade reports Under the Buckley amendment of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (1974), stu-dents have full rights of privacy with regard totheir academic records, including their gradereports. The University sends one copy of thequarterly grade report to each student. Grade change A grade may not be changed except when an error has been made in arriving at or recording agrade. Such changes are permissible up to the endof the succeeding term.40 SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Academic performance level In order to remain at regular academic status, undergraduate students must maintain a grade-point average of 2.5; and graduate students mustmaintain a grade-point average of 3.0 in the majorarea(s) as well as in the overall program. In addi-tion, a grade of at least C- (for either undergradu-ate or graduate students) must be earned in anycourse for which credit is to be applied to a degreeprogram. In order to replace any grade, the stu-dent must repeat the course. This includes attend-ing lecture and/or laboratory sessions as required,completing assigned work, and taking anyrequired examinations. Full tuition is charged.Both the original and repeat grades are entered inthe permanent records, but only the second gradeis computed in the grade-point average andincluded in the number of units applied towardthe degree. A course may be repeated only once.Continuation in a degree program is seriouslyjeopardized for the student who has receivedmore than two grades of less than C-. Academic probation Students whose cumulative grade-point aver- age at the end of any quarter is less than 2.5 forundergraduate students or 3.0 for graduate stu-dents are placed on academic probation, and thenumber of units for subsequent registrations isrestricted to a maximum of 12 per quarter. Thegrade-point average is computed separately fortotal units applicable to a School of Public Healthdegree and for courses in the major area. Studentswith two quarters of unsatisfactory performancejeopardize their standing in a degree program. Repeating courses A student wishing to improve his/her grade once grades have been posted for a course mustrepeat the course. When repeating a course, thestudent must attend class and laboratory sessionsas ordinarily required, take all regularly scheduledexaminations, and pay full tuition. Both gradeswill appear on the student's permanent record,but only the repeat grade is computed in theG.P.A. and included in the total units earned. A student may repeat a course only once, and no more than two courses may be repeated in astudent's degree program. Graduate-level courses Undergraduate seniors with G.P.A.s of 3.0 or better and who meet prerequisites may, withapproval of the instructor and consent of the asso-ciate dean of the School of Public Health and thedean of the school offering the course, enroll for alimited number of graduate-level courses (500-levelor above). Only with special permission may creditbe applied to the undergraduate degree, in whichcase the credit may not be applied toward a gradu-ate degree. Veteran's educational benefits eligibility If a student receives educational assistance from the Department of Veteran's Affairs and thecumulative grade-point average (G.P.A.) remainsbelow the graduation requirements for more thanthe equivalent units of three consecutive terms, the student will not be certified for VeteransAffairs educational benefits until his/her academicstatus is restored to regular standing.

The comple- mentary nature of these research disciplines provides an efficient investigativealliance that combines the health perspective of biological science with the objec- tivity of statistics. EPIDEMIOLOGY Although the science of epidemiology began with the investigation of the infectious dis-ease outbreaks, the modern plagues of heart disease, cancer, stroke, and injuries arealso considered by the modern epidemiologist. Contemporary epidemiology builds upon the premise that disease or health is not randomly distributed within populations.Epidemiology comprises the research methods that identify and isolate the underlying causesof disease and injury as well as health. The diversity of this investigative science is illustratedby a number of research accomplishments ranging from identification of control and preven-tive measures for AIDS and diabetes mellitus; to etiologic processes important in the develop-ment of malignant neoplasms, cardiovascular diseases, and infectious diseases. Other accom-plishments of epidemiology include discovery of social and biological mechanisms involved inthe spread of measles, AIDS, and pertussis through human populations; and preventive mea-sures for surgical-wound and other hospital-acquired infections. Contemporary epidemiologicinquiry ranges from investigation of the roles of prescription medications, nutrition, electro-magnetic fields, and pesticides in human cancer; to identification of the health benefits of cho-lesterol reduction, smoking cessation, and use of safety bindings on skis. The epidemiologiststudies the distribution and determinants of health and disease in populations. The emphasisFACULTY PROFESSORS David E. Abbey (Adjunct) Gary E. FraserSynnove M. F.

KNUTSEN, ChairEPIDEMIOLOGY AND BIOSTATISTICS 65 placed upon the investigative process has inspired some to describe the epidemiologist as a medical detective. Epidemiologic research incorporates use of statistical techniques and anunderstanding of environmental, genetic, and social characteristics important in disease devel-opment and spread. Although epidemiology is a relatively young discipline, this collection of investigative methods has become an integral part of public health; epidemiologic findings permeate allfields of human health. The efficacy and confirmed success of epidemiology guarantee anexciting future for those who meet the challenges of this advancing science. BIOSTATISTICS Biostatisticians have an important role in a wide variety of health and biomedicalinvestigations that explore the frontiers of man's knowledge. A biostatistician typi-cally serves on a research or management team, with the specific responsibility of guiding the design, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. A biostatisticianmay also be involved in projects that require the development of statistical methodologyin terms of refinement of old methods or development of new methods of analysis to han-dle data that depart from traditional models. The master's degree programs in biostatistics are planned in such a way as to provide concurrent preparation in statistical methodology, data processing, programming, and com-puter operations. Such combined training is widely regarded as the best method to ade-quately prepare statisticians to meet the needs of an increasingly computerized environ-ment. Students with diverse undergraduate majors\u2014mathematics, physical science, socialsciences, biology, business administration, and the health professions\u2014are usually eligibleto pursue these programs. Individuals enrolled in the statistics program are prepared to participate in projects such as the following: population surveys in which, with randomly selected samples, oneestimates the health status, the health care needs, or the health facilities of a particularcommunity; prospective studies in which the relationship between disease and other fac-tors is studied, or in which the effectiveness of a certain health program is evaluated; clin-ical trials in which a certain new drug, such as a cancer chemotherapeutic agent or someother treatment, is evaluated for its safety and effectiveness. The primary purpose of the biostatistics and epidemiology programs is to provide a climate in which students may grow in their knowledge and understanding of theory andpractice. Thus they may gain competencies that will enable them to apply the principleslearned to the solution of a broad variety of problems related to health and disease. Allactivities and resources\u2014including teaching, research, consultation, community service,and social and spiritual interactions\u2014are directed toward encouraging such growth bothin students and in members of the faculty.66 SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Department goals The Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics: 1.

For more than thirty years the Schoolhas adapted program-delivery styled to meet the needs of busy professionals who, for a variety of reasons, do not choose to become full-time, on-campus students.Currently the Online Executive Master of Public Health degree program caters to bothlocal and international students. Programs also offered in Cambodia, Chile, and Peru; andin the summer of 2005 an M.P.H. degree program will begin in Russia. The off-campus programs require faculty to travel to the education site and teach courses in a condensed format. Research has shown that this form of instruction is just aseffective as the less condensed method, especially with experienced professionals eager tolearn. Distance-learning technology (interactive computer hook-ups, live and prerecord-ed video/TV presentations, etc.) may also be utilized. Faculty members and coursedescriptions for these programs are listed in the academic department through whichthey are offered. ONLINE EXECUTIVE MASTER OF PUBLIC HEALTH The Online Executive Master of Public Health degree is offered with a major in public health practice. This is a three-year, blended programwith online courses as well as two two-weekresidential sessions. A new cohort of studentsbegins each August when students come oncampus for two weeks. During this time, theyplan a program of study with their adviser,complete 5 units of course work, become familiarwith the technology, and get to know the otherstudents in the group. Students go home ready tostudy online as well as ready to support andmentor each other. It is a very positive way tolearn. At the beginning of the second year, students again come to Loma Linda University for twoweeks\u2014their last on-campus-residency require-ment. The program closes with a culminating activi- ty, which includes a comprehensive examination,the community practicum report, preparation of aportfolio, and an exit interview.

Grade point average A grade point average (G.P.A.) of 3.0 (B) must be maintained.Financial clearance The student is expected to maintain a clear financial status at all times. Financial clearancemust be obtained: (a) before registering for any class;(b) before receiving a certificate; or (c) beforerequesting a transcript, statement of completion, orother certification to be issued to any person, organi-zation, or professional board. Graduation petition A graduation petition must be submitted to the Office of Admissions and Academic Recordsby December 15 for participation in commence-ment activities the following June, or at least onequarter before anticipated completion of certifi-cate requirements. Application to a degree program Participants completing an advanced certificate program or a second certificate program must applyto a degree program offered at the School of PublicHealth. In general, this will require adding the pub-lic health core courses (13 units) and any additionalrequirements of the degree program. CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS Epidemiology and biostatistics Five certificate programs are offered through the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics.These programs offer specific skills in the biostatis-tics and epidemiology areas to professionals and oth-ers who desire to add these skills to their practices inpublic health but who do not necessarily wish toearn degrees. In addition, these programs may serveas an introduction to graduate study. Students whohave the opportunity to complete the basic certifi-cate programs may eventually enter the master'sdegree programs. Students who successfully com-plete the basic certificate programs must apply forregular acceptance into a master's or doctoral degreeprogram in the School of Public Health prior to tak-ing course work toward a second or advanced certifi-cate program. Other certificate programs Certificate programs are also offered in humanitarian assistance, reproductive health, andtobacco control methods. Fitness instructor certi-fication is also available.Certificate Programs The School of Public Health offers certificates in various programs to meet the needs of qualified individuals seeking to develop competencies in specialties in publichealth but who, for a variety of reasons, do not choose to become full-time, degree- seeking students. Instruction for the certificate program is primarily provided by regular School of Public Health faculty members on campus during regular quarter terms. Students are responsibleto follow regular registration procedures during regularly scheduled time periods.OUR MISSION 119 CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS 119 CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS 119 CERTIFICATE IN BASIC BIOSTATISTICS There is a growing need to be able to interpret scientific literature, establish databases, and do simple descriptive and analytical statisticalanalyses.

Theseare: the Del E. Webb Memorial Library, includ- ing the Jorgensen Learning Resources, the Jesse Medical Library and Information Center, and the Veterans Administration Library Services. In addition to these facilities, specialized libraries are located in various medical and schooldepartments on campus. Central library The Del E. Webb Memorial Library is the cen- tral library of Loma Linda University. Its historicalroots go back to 1907, when a small library collec-tion was started in a room of the old Loma LindaSanitarium. In 1953 the growing collection wasmoved to its own building on the Loma Lindacampus. Then in 1981, a new library building wasbuilt from a grant by the Del E. Webb Foundation,giving the library a total floor space of 87,670square feet. This structure now houses the mainlibrary, while the old structure is now sharedbetween the Department of Archives and SpecialCollections and the bound retrospective journals.According to<http://www.llu.edu/llu/library/about/libstats2001-2002.htm> as of June 2002, the library has: 31 databases; and a total of 335,848 books, bound and current journals/periodicals, and media items,including: 156,041 monographic titles (print); and 6,138 journals (print and electronic). Library mission The mission of the Library is to stimulate and support the information needs of theUniversity's instructional, research, and serviceprograms. To this end the Library provides a fullrange of information-support services, including,but not limited to, reference, circulation, reserve, access to the Internet, and hundreds of onlinedatabases, e.g., full-text, automatic, selective dis- semination class-integrated library-instruction and services that supportdistance education and University outreach pro-grams. Worldwide access The Library provides access to other collec- tions worldwide using Internet technologies. Italso participates in a number of national andregional networks. One of these is the NationalNetwork of the Libraries of Medicine, founded bythe National Library of Medicine. This structure isdivided into eight regional sections, one of whichis the Pacific Southwest Region. The Del E. WebbMemorial Library belongs to this region and is thedesignated medical resource library for SanBernardino and Riverside counties. Local librarycooperatives include the IEALC (Inland EmpireAcademic Library Cooperative) and SIRCULS(San Bernardino, Inyo, Riverside Counties UnitedLibrary Services). Membership in these coopera-tives gives our students, faculty, and staff accessto the collections of these libraries. Archives and special collections The Department of Archives and Special Collections is the central repository of informa-tion on the history of Loma Linda University, thehealth sciences, and major collections onAdventism. In addition to print materials thatinclude rare books, theses, and dissertations,there are microforms, sound recordings, and sev-eral thousand photographs. Searchable digitizedindexes for various document files are also avail-able via the Library's web site. The collection alsoincludes 14,000 linear feet of archival materials,which include papers of various denominationaland University officials, as well as the congres-sional papers of the Honorable Jerry and ShirleyPettis.
