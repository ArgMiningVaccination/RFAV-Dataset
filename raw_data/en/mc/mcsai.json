The USDA Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review team is supporting this effort by conducting a series of evidence scans related to total dietary protein intake. These evidence scans will inform potential future systematic reviews (SRs) that will be conducted to update the macronutrient (including protein) DRIs. Current DRIsa for di etary protein include Estimated Average Requirements (EAR) and Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA ) values for apparently healthy children age 7 months to 18 years and apparently healthy adults age 19 years and older, based on a meta-analysis of nitrogen balance studies . Adequate Intake (AI) values for apparently healthy infants 0 to 6 months, are based on the average consumption of protein from human milk. There was not enough information to establish specific Tolerable Upper Intake levels (UL) for dietary protein or the indispensable amino acids. Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDR), defined as \"a range of intakes for a particular energy source that is associated with reduced risk of chronic diseases while providing adequate intakes of essential nutrients,\" are set for protein and the other macronutrients.a Protein requirements (expressed as a percentage of total energy intake) are not independent of other energy sources or the total energy requirement of the individual. However, the upper range for total protein intake from diet as a percent of total energy intake was set at no more than 35% in adults to decrease risk of chronic disease. In 2005, there was insufficient evidence to support a recommendation for total protein intake or to suggest an upper limit for an AMDR for protein intake based on chronic disease ris k specifically. It was acknowledged, however, that high total protein intake or high animal protein intake is implicated in the following health conditions : osteoporosis, renal stones, renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease, and obesity. Since the 2005 DRIs for macronutrients and energy were published, further research has been completed on the relationship between protein intake and health, including adverse health effects, chronic disease risk, and protein intake requirements overall. To address the update to the evidence base around protein intake and to aid in informing future work on the DRIs, the following evidence scans were completed: The first evidence scan ( Chapter 1 ) addresses the following questi ons: What is the relationship between high dietary protein intake and acute adverse health effects? What is the relationship between high amino acid intake and acute adverse health effects? The second evidence scan ( Chapter 2 ) addresses the following question: What is the relationship between dietary protein intake and risk of chronic diseaseb? The third evidence scan (Chapter 3 ) addresses the following questions: What is the average daily dietary protein intake requirementc of apparently healthy individuals by life stage and sex? What is the average daily intake requirement for individual indispensable amino acids of apparently healthy individuals by life stage and sex? a Institute of Medicine 2005.

Detailed methodology for each evidence scan can be found in each of the three specific methods sections below. An evidence scan is a systematic and exploratory process used to describe the volume and characteristics of research available on a topic or question and to identify evidence gaps. They are characterized by the following: Provid ing objective data to support topic and question development, refinement, and prioritization, and inform protocol development Not answering the research question, but giving a description of available evidence Not involving r isk of bias assessment, synthesis, or grading the strength of the evidence Develop a protocol For each evidence scan, the NESR team collaborated with the Working Group to develop a protocol. A n evidence scan protocol is a plan for how a specific review or scan will be conducted. The protocol includes: Analytic framework Literature search and screening plan o Inclusion and exclusion criteria o Electronic databases and search terms The evidence scan p rotocols were established up -front, and designed to c apture the most appropriate, relevant, and direct body of evidence related to the topic or question of interest. Specific methods and any variations to protocols that occurred during the course of the evidence scans are documented in the three chapters of this report. A description of NESR's methodology for developing an analytic framework is below. NESR's methodology for developing inclusion and exclusion criteria and the search strategy, as well as processes related to screening and selecting studies for inclusion in the evidence scan, is described, below, in \" Search for, screen, and select literature.\" Develop analytic frameworks Analytic frameworks were developed for each evidence scan question. An analytic framework defines the core elements of the scan question, includes definitions for key terms, and helps to ensure that important contributing el ements in the causal chain will be considered. The analytic framework serves as the foundation for the rest of the ev idence scan process and informs the inclusion/exclusion criteria, literature search strategy, and data extraction. A standard framework, called the PICO framework, was used to define core elements of each evidence scan question. The elements of the PICO framework are the Population (for both the intervention/exposure and for the outcome), Intervention and/or exposure, Comparator (i.e., the alternative being compared to the intervention or exposure), and Outcomes. Key terms, key confounders, and other factors to be considered (i.e., mediators, moderators, covariates) were also identified and included in the analytic framework where appropriate. Evidence Scans: DRI Protein Update, 2022 nesr.usda.gov | 8 Search for, s creen, and s elect literature Systematic searching, screening, and selecting the scientific literature is a process through which NESR sought to identify the most complete and relevant body of evidence related to the e vidence scan questions. The process started with defining inclusion and exclusion criteria a priori , followed by developing and implementing literature search strategies, and finally screening and identifying search results. The entire process was documented, including a complete list of articles that met criteria for inclusion in each scan, and a list of excluded articles, with the rationale for exclusion. Define inclusion and exclusion criteria Inclusion and exclusion criteria provide an objective, consistent, and transparent framework for determining which articles to include in each evidence scan. These criteria were developed to guide selection of the most relevant and appropriate body of evidence for each evidence scan. Additionally, these criteria were framed to increase the utility of the scans for the upcoming protein DRI process . Any revisions to the criteria that occurred during the evidence scan are documented in the individual chapters in this report. NESR analysts collaborated with the Working Group to establish inclusion and exclusion criteria that were tailored to the specific scan question addressed. Developing and i mplementing the literature search s trategy Once the inclusion and exclusion criteria were set, the NESR librarian used the analytic framework and inclusion/ exclusion criteria to guide development of a comprehensive literature search strategy. The librarian worked in collaboration with NESR staff to construct a preliminary search strategy using PubMed operators and search terms. This was used to conduct a test search, preview the results, and correct any syntax, spelling, or grammatical errors. Each search strategy underwent multiple revisions to refine and adjust the search before it was finalized for use. The search strategies are included in this report for all evidence scans completed (Chapters 1-3). Identify bibliographic databases In Chapters 1 and 2, the librarian searched PubMed alone. In Chapter 3, the librarian used Scopus and Web of Science to map citations . Develop search terms and apply search filters NESR analysts helped identify initial key terms and/or relevant articles to ensure that the NESR librarian understood the scope and intent of the evidence scan question. The librarian was responsible for drafting the search and incorporating feedback from NESR analysts in finalizing the search. Individual evidence scan search strategies are detailed in the report chapters below. Screen and select studies The screening of search results was facilitated by the use of a web-based tool (i.e., DistillerSR) and screening forms that were developed based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria identified for each evide nce scan. All search results were dual screened by two NESR analysts. The goal of screening was to review the search results and exclude those that did not meet the inclusion criteria. Screening was completed at three levels. The first level of screening was completed using only the title of each article. If an article was not excluded at this level, it moved forward to the second level, where the abstract was screened. Finally, if an article passed the first two levels, it moved to the third level, where the full text of the article was screened. Any disagreements between analysts were reconciled between the two screenings. If necessary, a third analyst was consulted to resolve differences. Any deviations from this screening process are noted in each chapter of this report. Evidence Scans: DRI Protein Update, 2022 nesr.usda.gov | 9 Document the search results After the electronic searches were completed, NESR analysts and the librarian documented the literature search and screening results by compiling lists of the included and excluded citations, along with the rationale for exclusion at the full -text level. Extract data NESR analysts extracted and summarized data from each included article to objectively describe the body of evidence available for each evidence scan. To expedite data extraction, only the most es sential data for answering the question were extracted. Speci fic elements extracted for each evidence scan are detailed in subsequent chapters . Once the types of data to be extracted were determined, an electronic data extraction form was developed and used to facilitate accurate, consistent, and efficient data extraction. This form ensured that the same information from each article was formatted consistently, which made the content easier to compare and contrast during synthesis. NESR analysts used Disti llerSR to extract data. One NESR analyst extracted data from each included article using the data extraction form. In some cases, the required data were not reported in the article. In those situations, the data were recorded as \"not reported.\" Next, a second analyst reviewed only the extracted results for completeness, accuracy, and consistent presentation and formatting. Evidence tables were created by NESR analysts using the extracted data. Description of the evidence NESR analysts described the volume and characteristics of the evidence identified using text an d tables considerations were noted that could potentially be useful for future DRI systematic reviews. Identifying considerations for future DRI work Points that could be of note to the Working Group were summarized as considerations for their future work and future contributions to the macronutrient DRI process. These noted considerations were completed after describing the volume and characteristics of the evidence, and they were based on the gaps and limitations observed during data extraction. H igh protein intake and acute adverse health effects nesr.usda.gov | 10 Chapter 1 - H igh dietary protein intake ( including amino acid intake) and acute adverse health effects Marlana Bates, MPH, RD ,a Charlotte Bahnfleth, PhD,b Natasha Cole, PhD, MPH, RD,b Molly Higgins, MLIS,c Scinto - Madonich, MS ,b Joanne Spahn, MS, RDN,d and Julie Obbagy, PhD, RDe Specific methods to conduct this evidence scan Develop a protocol The research questions , \"What is the relationship between high dietary protein intake and acute adverse health effects ?\" and \"What is the relationship between high amino acid intake and acute adverse health effects ?\", were explored with an evidence scan. The following section describes the protocol developed for this evidence scan. The analytic framework for the evidence scan examining the relationships between total protein intake and amino acid intake and acute adverse health effects is presented in Figure 1-a . The analytic framework visually represents the overall scope of the evidence scan question and depicts the contributing elements that were considered. The first intervention or exposure of interest wa s any level of total protein intake defined as elevated or high, or compared to a lower level of protein intake. The comparator wa s a lower protein intake or no comparator. The next intervention or exposure of interest was any level of amino acid intake defined as elevated or high, or compared to a lower level of amino acid intake. The comparator was a lower amino acid intake or no comparator. The included amino acids we re comparator was a lower level of amino acid intake or no comparator. For both intervention/exposures, the outcomes were any acute adverse health effects , especially those with a focus on toxicity. General outcomes were listed in the analytic framework but we re not limited to this list. There were no key confounders noted due to the limited data extraction completed in evidence scans. a Analyst, NESR team, Lead for high protein intake and acute adverse health effects evidence scan; Panum Group, under contract with the FNS , USDA, b Analyst, NESR team; Panum Group, under with the FNS, USDA, c Librarian, NESR team; Panum Group, under contract with the FNS, USDA, d Analyst, NESR team, NGAD, CNPP, FNS, USDA Project Lead (Chapter 1), NESR team, NGAD, CNPP, FNS, USDA High protein intake and acute adverse health effects nesr.usda.gov | 11 Figure 1-a.

The final search terms and number of search results are included in Appendix 1-a . Standard screening and selection process es were utilized for this scan, however handsearching was completed in addition to the electronic database search. H andsearching of the citations from each included review was completed in order to verify the comprehensiveness of the literature search for this evidence scan. The included citations for each evidence scan can be found in References for all three evidence scan chapters. Extract data NESR analysts extracted data from each included review to objectively desc ribe the body of evidence available in the last 5 years about high protein and high amino acid intake. Data extraction was completed in DistillerSR by one analyst for each review and a second analyst checked the extracted data for accuracy. The following data elements were extracted from each included review: Publication author and publication year Study design Purpose of review or research question answered by the review Population studied (life stage/age group) Adverse health effects discussed or outlined in the review o Dosage of high protein and/or high amino acid intake (if noted) o Duration of high protein and/or high amino acid intake (if noted) If study noted no adverse health effects o Dosage of high protein and/or high amino acid intake (if noted) o Duration of high protein and/or high amino acid intake (if noted) High protein intake and acute adverse health effects nesr.usda.gov | 14 No effect estimates or measures of statistical validity were extracted from the included reviews and no quality assessm ents were completed. Describe the evidence NESR analysts summarized the volume and characteristics of included studies to inform the following two questions: 1. What is the relationship between high dietary protein intake and acute adverse health effects? 2. What is the relationship between high amino acid intake and acute adverse health effects? The extracted data were summarized in written form, as well as presented visually in a table. The extracted information helped analysts and the Working Group understand the following: The volume and characteristics of research examining the levels of protein intake (total protein and amino acids) at which acute adverse health outcomes do or do not occur Which acute adverse health outcomes occur as a result of high protein or amino acid intake and how they are defined How 'high protein intake' and 'high/excess amino acid intake' are defined in the literature Considerations for future DRI work Considerations for future SRs completed to inform the DRI process across acute adverse health effects were included in this evidence scan. Results Literature search and screening results The literature search yielded 2,375 search results after the removal of duplicates (see Figure 2). Dual - screening resulted in the exclusion of 2, 240 titles, 44 abstracts, and 70 full-text articles. Reasons for full -text exclusion are in Appendix 1-b . One additional review was identified from the manual search. The body of evidence included 22 reviews : 6 reviews provided evidence on total dietary protein 16 reviews provided evidence on amino acids High protein intake and acute adverse health effects nesr.usda.gov | 15 Figure 1-b. Literature search and screen flowchart for high protein i ntake and acute adverse health effects Description of the evidence This evidence scan included 22 reviews. Six reviews included some information regarding high dietary protein intake and acute adverse health effects ( three narrative reviews,1-3 two SRs,4,5 and one SR with MA6). Sixteen reviews included some information regarding high dietary amino acid intake and acute adverse health effects (13 narrative reviews7-19 and 3 SRs with MAs20-22). Population characteristics Total Protein Reviews The populations studied for adverse effects in all included reviews were adults, aside from one review where age was not reported.3 Three of the six protein reviews included studies with adult and older adult participants,2,4,5 one focused on adults,1 and one focused on older adults.6 Table 2 shows the full extraction table with population, intervention/exposure, and outcome data of the total protein reviews. Amino Acid Reviews The populations studied for adverse effects in the amino acid reviews ranged from adolescents to older adults, aside from the four reviews in which age was not reported or unclear.10,16-18 Two reviews included adolescent, High protein intake and acute adverse health effects nesr.usda.gov | 16 adult, and older adult populations,20,21 three revi ews focused on adults only,7,13,19 and seven reviews focused on adults and older adults.8,9,11,12,14,15,22 Table 3 shows the full extraction table with population, intervention/exposure, and outcome data of the amino acid reviews. Intervention/exposure characteristics Total Protein Reviews While six reviews were found total, three were narrative reviews describing the landscape of evidence available regarding high protein intake, and none of the included SRs were designed specifically to review evidence on protein toxicity. The extracted data from the reviews demonstrates gaps in the evidence availa ble to determine specific and generalizable UL values. Amino Acid Reviews The 16 reviews identified that met the inclusion/exclusion criteria provided information about 7 amino acids. Multiple reviews suggested methods for establishing UL values in the future as more evidence becomes available. While most reviews evaluated the safety of amino acid supplementation, noted adverse effects from high amino acid intake were supported by only a few studies with limited data. The dosage and duration of amino acid intake/supplementation were not clearly defined or were not reported. One review evaluated amino acids generally,18 four reviews evaluated arginine,8,15,17,22 three reviews evaluated glutamine,9,10,17 two reviews evaluated histidine,13,19 four reviews evaluated leucine,7,8,11,17 three reviews evaluated lysine,17,20,21 one review evaluated methionine,14 and four reviews evaluated tryptophan.8,12,16,17 Two reviews had information about multiple amino acids.8,17 Outcome assessment Total Protein Reviews Three reviews mentioned or discussed acute adverse effects occurring as a result of high protein intake and three reviews discussed instances of high protein intake without adverse effects. Adverse effects 1. One SR reported suppressed appetite with high protein intake (dosage/duration of intervention not reported).6 2. Another SR reported changes in urinary biomarkers (increased urinary calcium and decreased urinary pH) with 27 g per day of whey protein for 3 days.5 3. The same SR reported exacerbation of acne lesions when consuming a high level of protein for 60 days.5 4. A narrative review provided a general list of possible adverse effects of high protein intake (no duration or dosage information provided): intestinal discomfort, hyperaminoacidemia, hyperammonemia, hyperinsulinemia, dehydration, irritation, nausea, diarrhea, liver and kidney injuries, fatigue, headache, seizures, high risk of cardiovascular disease, or even death.3 No adverse effects 1. One narrative review reported no harmful effects (including changes in blood parameters and clinical side effects) with protein intake of 3.0-4.4 g/kg/d over 8 weeks in healthy resistance-trained adults.1 High protein intake and acute adverse health effects nesr.usda.gov | 17 2. Another narrative review noted that there have been no previously reported adverse effects of protein intake above the RDA (within the AMD R).2 3. One SR reported no pattern of abnormality among blood variables or blood pressure in studies with protein intake under 35% of total energy intake.4 One study compared intake of 0.8 g/kg to 3.6 g/kg in a 12-week crossover and found s ignificantly increased blood urea nitrogen concentrations. Another study found changes in a number of renal lab values with 1 week of high protein, but the clinical significance was unclear and not viewed as 'adverse'. Amino Acid Reviews Fourteen reviews m entioned or discussed acute adverse effects occurring as a result of high amino acid intake and 3 reviews discussed instances of high protein intake without adverse effects. Some reviews discussed both instances of adverse effects and instances without any serious effects. Adverse effects 1. Nausea/vomiting/GI discomfort Varying high doses of leucine in an unspecified duration7 At above 7.5 g of tryptophan in an unspecified duration12 Varying high doses of lysine in an unspecified duration20,21 At 24-64 g of histidine per day for 4 weeks19 2.

Smell/taste change At 65 mg of histidine per day for 24 days19 8. Eosinophilia -myalgia syndrome 1989 incident involving high dose tryptophan16 No adverse effects 1. Acute or chronic doses of tryptophan ranging from 1-15 g per day had no effects of GI pain/discomfort, diarrhea, or constipat ion12 2. No reports of signs of toxicity or mutagenic activity in subjects treated with histidine (dose and duration not specified)13 3. Varying dosages of methionine in a crossover study (9.2-91 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks with 2-week washout) showed no signs of intolerance or changes in body composition at lowest observed adverse effect level14 4. In doses of arginine ranging from 3-42 g per day, no adverse effects were noted overall15 5. Several clinical studies were submitted to FDA for GRAS determination showing a lack of adverse effects17 6. Contaminated amino acid supplements have been shown to cause adverse effects but no peer - reviewed literature documents severe adverse reactions to an amino acid overdose, even in subgroups suspected of frequently consuming dietary supplements17,18 Considerations for future DRI work As the DRI pr ocess moves forward at the guidance of the Working Group, the following may be important to consider as a result of this completed evidence scan: 1. This evidence scan found little evidence to support a systematic review on the acute adverse health effects resulting from high dietary protein intake. There were no reviews focused specifically on protein and adverse health effects, only a few select sentences or cited studies within the reviews. 2. A large proportion of the data extracted in this evidence scan cam e from narrative reviews. Although narrative reviews can help provide an overview of potentially relevant evidence, they involve less rigorous methodology compared to systematic reviews (including those with meta-analyses), which are considered the gold standard of evidence synthesis. 3. Since the previous edition of DRIs were published, more research has been completed on amino acid intake. However, much of this resear ch was conducted in animals or was focused on chronic health outcomes. Further exploration of amino acid intake, especiall y supplementation of high doses, is needed to inform potential future UL values.

In studies with protein intak e of up to 1.8- 2.5 g/kg daily, no pattern of abnormality among blood variables, suggestive of adverse effects of increased protein intake, was observed. One exception was in a study of 5 young men participating in a 12- week crossover study comparing \"low\" (0.8 g/kg), \"moderate\" (1.8 g/kg), and \"high\" (3.6 g/kg) protein intake. In this study, protein intake of 3.6 g/kg significantly increased blood urea nitrogen concentrations beyond the UL of the normal range. A one week crossover study with \"high-protein\" diet in healthy young men induces significant changes in the GFR, the filtration fraction, albuminuria, serum uric acid, and urinary pH values, whereas other indicators of renal function remained unchanged. The clinical significance of these findings is u nclear and all studies in this review had protein intake of under 35% total energy intake.

The analytic framework for the evidence scan examining the relationship between dietary protein intake and risk of chronic disease is presented in Figure 2-a. The analytic framework visually represents the overall scope of the evidence scan question and depicts the contributing elements that were co nsidered. The intervention or exposure of interest was total protein intake from foods, beverages, and dietary supplements . The comparator was consumption of different levels of total protein intake or no comparator. The outcomes we re chronic disease outcomes, including: bone outcomes, sarcopenia, renal outcomes, risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) , risk of diabetes, growth/size/body composition, neurocognitive development, dementia/cognitive decline, and all -cause mortality (ACM). General outcomes we re listed in the analytic framework but we re not limited to this list.

Analytic f ramework for protein intake and chronic disease risk Search for and select studies NESR analysts worked with the Working Group to finalize the inclusion and exclusion criteria and the literature search strategy, which are detailed in Table 2-a and Appendix 2-a , respectively . The study designs of interest for this specific scan included SRs , MAs , scoping reviews and umbrella reviews in order to streamline the literature search. Supplemental searches were completed to evaluate protein intake and length of sleep (search strategy detailed in Appendix 2-b ), as well as protein intake and appetite/satiety (search strategy detailed in Appendix 2-c ). Articles were screened by two NESR analysts independently for inclusion based on these pre-determined criteria and disagreements were reconciled by a third analyst. The DRI Protein WG desired information on the number articles that evaluated animal and/or protein intake. A bibliography of articles that evaluated protein intake from animal or plant sources but were excluded because analysis did not include an assessment of total protein intake is found in Appendix 2-d.

Data extraction was completed in DistillerSR by one analyst for each review and a second analyst checked the extracted data for accuracy. The following data elements were extracted from each included review: Publication author and publication year Study design Purpose of review or research question answered by the review Population studied (life stage/age group) Intervention/exposure and comparator Outcomes examined in the review Direction of the relationship between the intervention/exposure and outcome (inverse, positive, null) No effect estimates or measures of statistical validity were extracted from the included reviews. Describe the evidence NESR analysts summarized the volume and characteristics of included studies to inform the following question: What is the relationship between dietary protein intake and risk of chr onic disease? The ex tracted data were summarized in written form, as well as presented visually in a table. The extracted information helped analysts and the Working Group understand the following: P rotein intake and chronic disease risk nesr.usda.gov | 35 The volume and characteristics of research examining the levels of protein intake (total protei n and am ino acids) associated with increased chronic disease risk Which chronic disease outcomes occur as a result of total protein intake Quality and duplication assessment The Working Group reviewed results from the evidence scans conducted as described above and identified the following outcomes as warranting further investigation: ACM , bone health, CVD, diabetes , renal health and sarcopenia. For each identified study within these topic areas, NESR analysts conducted a formal assessment to evaluate the methodological quality of the review, noted the source of funding, and conducted a duplication assessment to identify the number of unique studies within the body of evidence. The following topics were excluded from further evaluation due to insufficient evidence (dementia/cognitive decline ; neurocognitive development) or were considered beyond the scope of chronic disease (growth, size, and body composition). Below is a brief description of each assessment. AMSTAR 2 assessment and documentation of funding source NESR analysts conduct ed a d ual, independent assessment for each review using AMSTAR 2 ( A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews ),a a 16-item critical appraisal tool for assessing the quality of SRs that include randomized and/or non-randomized studies. Critical domains were d efined a priori based on the needs of the Working Group. R esponses were compared, and any disagreements we re discussed and reconciled. To address the potential for conflict of interest and bias, NESR analysts also noted the funding source of each included review. Duplication assessment NESR analysts identified the component studies within each review that addressed specific outcomes, constructing tables to illustrate citation overlap across the body of evidence and identified the number of unique studies included within the identified reviews for each topic area. Considerations for future DRI work Considerations for future SRs completed to inform the DRI process across chronic disease outcomes were were included in this evidence scan.

There was considerable overlap of included studies between the three reviews with 31 unique studies (Appendix 2-i ). Adults were studied in the three articles, with two reviews also including older adults.23,25 The AMSTAR 2 ratings for the included SRs were moderate23,25 and low24 (Appendix 2-h ). Intervention/exposure characteristics All the included studies in the three reviews evaluated habitual protein intake as the exposure (one continuously ,25 one categorically ,23 and one with both24). Follow -up varied across these observational studies ranging from 3.4 years to 27 years. Outcome characteristics and trends P rotein intake and chronic disease risk nesr.usda.gov | 40 All three reviews and meta-analyses evaluated ACM as an outcome alongside other cause-specific outcomes. For ACM, effect estimates were broken down according to the following exposures: total protein intake, plant protein intake, and animal protein intake. There were mixed results (inconsistent) found for the relationship between total protein intake and ACM risk. Two reviews found null associations between animal protein intake and ACM risk 24,25 and one with a positive relationship.23 All three reviews found an inverse relationship between plant protein intake and ACM (increased intake of plant protein was associated with lower ACM risk). Bone health Seven SRs examined the relationship between protein intake and bone outcomes.26-32 Table 2-c shows the full extraction table with population, intervention/exposure, and outcome data for systematic reviews reporting on bone outcomes. Review and population characteristics Of the seven SRs on bone outcomes, five were conducted with MA 27-29,31,32 and two were conducted without MA.26,30 The number of included studies within each SR primarily ranged from 13 studies with relevant outcomes28 to 34 studies with relevant outcomes.32 However, one review included 103 studies with relevant outcomes (many of which were cross -sectional studies).27 Most reviews had considerable overlap in studies that provided data on relevant outcomes, with 149 unique articles represented in total (Appendix 2-j ). Of these, 124 reported on bone mass (bone mineral density [BMD] and/or bone mineral content [BMC]), 25 reported on fracture, and 6 reported on osteoporosis/osteopenia. Older adults were studied in all seven SRs and adults were studied in six SRs .27-32 Children and adolescents, 2 to 18 years old, were studied in one SR.27 The population of one SR focused on participants with overweight or obes ity.32 The AMSTAR 2 ratings for the included low,27,29,32 and critically low26,30,31 (Appendix 2-h ). Intervention/exposure characteristics All reviews on bone health included interventions that altered protein intake and six reviews included studies that assessed habitual protein intake (reported continuously and categoricall y).26-31 The included studies of one SR also had a primary focus on interventions designed to induce weight loss and interventions that were multi - component (but isolated the effect of total protein).32 The duration of interventions varied across the studies in the reviews, ranging from 4 days to 2 years. Similarly, the duration of follow -up for included observational studies varied across the reviews, ranging from no follow -up (cross -sectional studies) to 32 years. Outcome characteristics and trends All seven SRs examined outcomes related to bone mass, specifically BMD and BMC. The relationship between protein intake and bone mass varied across the reviews and by site examined, with positive, mixed, and null results reported. A variety of sites were examined within and across the reviews, such as hip, femoral neck, lumbar spine, and total body. Five SRs examined fractures as an outcome.26-29,31 The review conclusions tended towards null and inverse (higher protein, lower risk) for hip fracture. For other fracture sites, such as the spine and the forearm, the review conclusions tended to be null, mixed, or inconc lusive. Finally, one SR assessed osteoporosis as an outcome, reporting mixed results. 27 Cardiovascular disease risk Ten SRs examined the relationship between protein intake and CVD outcomes.23-25,33 -39 Table 2-d shows the full extraction table with population, intervention/exposure, and outcome data for SR s reporting on CVD outcomes. Review and population characteristics Protein intake and chronic disease risk nesr.usda.gov | 41 Of the 10 included reviews, two were umbrella reviews33,39 and 8 were SR s, 5 of which were conducted with MA.23-25,34,36 Four reviews included only RCTs33-35,39 and the other six included only PCSs .23-25,36 -38 The 2 umbrella reviews each had 6 meta-analyses of RCTs with 8 relevant unique studies due to considerable overlap, and the 8 SRs had 71 relevant unique studies with minimal overlap by outcome. (Appendix 2-k ) One review included individuals during pregnancy ,37 one review included adults (age 19-59 years of age) ,33 and the remaining reviews included adults and older adults.23-25,34-36,38,39 The AMSTAR 2 ratings for the included SRs and critically low.36 (Appendix 2-h ) Intervention/exposure characteristics Of the four reviews evaluating trials, all evaluated interventions that altered protein intake.33-35,39 Of the six reviews evaluating observational studies (PCS in all), the studies were evaluating habitual protein intake, both categorical and continuous.23-25,36-38 The four reviews containing only RCTs ranged in intervention duration from 0.8 months to 52 months in those studies that reported intervention duration. 33,34 Of the reviews including only PCSs , follow -up duration ranged from 2.3 years to 32 years in those reviews that reported follow -up duration.23-25,36,38 Outcome characteristics and trends There were 4 categories of CVD outcomes within the 10 included reviews evaluating total protein intake and CVD risk. Five reviews evaluated blood pressure, including hypertension33-35,38,39; one review evaluated the protein intake of pregnant persons and the blood pressure of their offspring.37 Cardiovascular disease mortality was detailed in three reviews .23-25 One review evaluated stroke mortality23 and one review evaluated stroke risk.36 Finally, one review focused on protein intake and coronary heart disease risk.38 Of the five total reviews evaluating protein intake and blood pressure, results were mixed, including null and inverse results. In the review evaluating protein intake in pregnancy, there was a null association with offspring blood pressure. Total protein intake was not consistently associated with cardiovascular disease mortality. Null and positive associations with total protein and animal protein was observed with CVD mortality; null and inverse associations were observed with plant protein. Both reviews evaluating stroke related outcomes found null associations, as did the review evaluating coronary heart disease risk. Dementia/cognitive decline ( adults) Two SRs examined the relationship between protein intake and dementia/cognitive decline outcomes.40,41 Table 2-e shows the full extraction table with population, intervention/exposure, and outcome data for SR s reporting on dementia/cognitive decline outcomes. Review and population characteristics Both SRs on dementia and cognitive decline outcomes were conducted without MA and primarily included cross-sectional studies: one review included eight cross-sectional studies and one PCS,40 while the other review included five cross -sectional studies and two RCTs.41 There was minimal overlap in studies included across the two reviews. The populations studied included adults and older adults in one review41 and older adults alone in the other review.40 Intervention/ex posure characteristics Both reviews on dementia and cognitive decline outcomes assessed habitual intake or protein (reported continuously and categorically).40,41 The observational studies that assessed habitual intake of protein were predominantly cross -sectional, but the one included PCS reported a fol low-up duration of 8.5 months.40 One SR assessed an intervention (3 weeks in duration) that altered protein intake.41 Outcome characteristics and trends P rotein intake and chronic disease risk nesr.usda.gov | 42 A variety of cognitive outcomes were assessed across the two reviews including: abstract reasoning, digit subtraction, fluid intelligence, global cognition/cognitive function, immediate and delayed learning ability, inhibition control, memory, nonverbal learning, problem -solving ability, processing speed, reaction time, risk of mild cognitive impairment, short-term memory, sustained attention, verbal fluency, verbal and nonverbal memory, and working memory.40,41 Few studies within each review assessed the same aspect of cognition. One review reported predominantly null associations between protein intake and cognitive decline,40 while the other review reported mixed results with some positive associations.41 Diabetes ri sk Five SRs with MA,42-46 and one umbrella review of MAs33 examined the relationship between protein intake and risk of type 2 diabetes . Table 2-f shows the full extraction with population, intervention/exposure, outcome data and AMSTAR 2 rating for systematic and umbrella reviews reporting on diabetes outcomes. Review and population characteristics The 5 SRs with MA each included 6 to 9 PCSs , but there was significant overlap among included studies, with 12 unique studies in total across the reviews (see Appendix 2-l ). The umbrella review included six meta- analyses of RCTs. All the SRs included adults and older adults, while the umbrella review reported subject age as greater than or equal to 18 years. The AMSTAR 2 ratings for the included SR s were high,33 moderate,42,43,45,46 and critically low44 (Appendix 2 -h). Intervention/exposure characteristics All SR s included interventions that assessed higher verses lower habitual intake reported categorically, and four also examined a continuous measure of habitual protein intake.42,43,45,46 The one umbrella review examined meta-analyses which examined interventions that altered the quantity of protein intake.33 Outcome characteristics and trends Five SRs with MA found total protein intake and animal protein intake was positively associated with type 2 diabetes. Results for plant protein intake and type 2 diabetes were inconsistent, with studies reporting null ,43 inverse,42 or U-shaped curve associations46 or results which differed by gender44 or level of protein intake.45 The umbrella review which included six meta-analyses found higher compared to lower protein intake had a weak or null effect on Hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ).33 Growth, size, and body composition Fifteen systematic reviews47-61 and two umbrella reviews33,62 examined the relationship between protein intake and outcomes related to growth, size, and body composition. Table 2-g summarizes the population, intervention/exposure, and outcome data for reviews reporting on protein intake and growth, size, and body composition. Review and population characteristics Of the 15 SRs , 11 were conducted with MA47,49-53,56,58 -61 and 4 were conducted without MA.48,54,55,57 Most SRs included only RCTs,47,49- 53,56,58 -61 two only included PCSs,55,57 one included RCTs PCSs ,48 and one included RCTs and non- randomized controlled trials ( NRCTs ).54 The number of included studies within the systematic reviews ranged from two60 to 66.56 Of the two umbrella reviews, one included two systematic reviews62 and one included seven meta-analyses.33 Four reviews studied infant populations ,48,54,55,62 two of which also included toddlers 12-23 months and/or children 2 -12 years .48,55 Thirteen reviews studied adult populations ,33,47,49 -53,56 -61 10 of which also included older adults.33,47,50 -53,56,58 -60 Intervention/exposure characteristics P rotein intake and chronic disease risk nesr.usda.gov | 43 Fifteen reviews included interventions that altered protein intake,33,47 -54,56 -62 nine of which also included interventions designed to induce weight loss.47,49 -52,56,59 -61 Two reviews included interventions with s upplements designed to enhance athletic performance.53,58 Three reviews assessed habitual intake (reported continuously and/or categorically).48,55,57 Outcome characteristics Six reviews examined outcomes related to growth,48,54,55,57,59,62 including weight gain,48,54 gestational weight gain,57 incidence or prevalence of overweight and/or obesity,48,54,55,62 and weight loss maintenance.59 The relationship between protein intake during the first 2 years of life and risk of overweight and/or obesity later in childhood was a mix of positive and null resul ts. Seven reviews examined outcomes related to -score,33,49,54,61 length,54 BMI/BMI z-score,33,48,49,54,55,61,62 For protein intake and BMI/BMI z -score, reviews tended to show a positive relationship for infants and an inverse relationship in adults. Thirteen reviews examined outcomes related to body composition,47-56,58,60,61 including muscle mass,50 muscle thickness ,58 lean mass,47,51 -53,56,58 fat-free mass or fat-free mass index ,54,55,60,61 fat mass or fat mass index ,47- 50,52-55,58,6 1 body mass ,47 and body fat percentage.55 For fat mass, reviews tended to be a mix of positive and null results for infants, and a mix of inverse and null results for adults. For fat-free mass, reviews tended to report null results in both infants and adults. For lean mass, reviews tended to be a mix of positive and null results for adults. Neurocognitive development (children) No reviews were found that met the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this outcome. Renal health Two SRs examined the relationship between protein intake and renal outcomes.35,63 Table 2-h shows the full extraction table with population, intervention/exposure, and outcome data for SR s reporting on renal outcomes. Review and population characteristics Of the two SR s on renal outcomes, one was conducted with MA63 while one was conducted without MA.35 The SR with MA included 28 RCTs.63 The SR without MA included 13 RCTs, 5 cross -sectional studies, and 2 PCSs with data relevant to the evidence scan's included outcomes.35 There was some overlap in the included studies between the 2 reviews, with 41 unique articles with relevant outcome data represented in total ( Appendix 2 - m). The populati ons studied in both SRs were adults and older adults (19 years old and older). The AMSTAR 2 rating was moderate for one SR63 and low for the other SR35 (Appendix 2-h ). Intervention/exposure characteristics Both SRs on renal outcomes assessed interventions that altered protein intake.35,63 The SR that included observational studies also examined habitual intake of protein (measured and reported continuously and in categories).35 The duration of included trials across reviews ranged from 1 day to 104 weeks,35,63 while the time to follow -up of included observational studies ranged from no follow -up (cross -sectional studies) to 21 years.35 Outcome characteristics and trends Both SRs examined glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or estimated GFR (eGFR).35,63 While mixed results were reported, there was a tendency toward positive relationships between protein intake and GFR. One SR reported on kidney disease incidence and the reported association with protein intake was null; however, this outcome was assessed in only one of the review's included studies.35 P rotein intake and chronic disease risk nesr.usda.gov | 44 Sarcopenia Five SRs examined the relationship between protein intake and sarcopenia outcomes .53,64-67 Table 2-h shows the full extraction table with population, intervention/exposure, and outcome data for SR s reporting on sarcopenia outcomes. Review and population characteristics Of the five SR s on total protein intake and sarcopenia outcomes, three were conducted with MA.53,64,67 The majority of studies included in the five reviews are PCSs and RCTs , though a few cross -sectional, case- control, and NRCTs were included as well. Between the 3 outcome categories (muscle strength, muscle mass, and sarcopenia) there were 100 relevant articles found in each of the reviews with no overlap present (Appendix 2-n ). A ll five reviews included studies with older adult participants with one review that also included adults age 19 to 59 years of age.53 The AMSTAR 2 ratings for the i ncluded ch aracteristics Three reviews included studies assessing habitual intake (reported continuously and categorically) ,64-66 three reviews included interventions that altered protein intake,53,66,67 and one included multi -component interventions that isolated the effect of total protein.53 Two reviews evaluating trials had intervention durations of 4.5 to 24 weeks53 and 10 to 104 weeks.67 The third review evaluating trials did not report intervention duration.66 One review that evaluated observational studies had a follow -up range of up to 6 years.65 The other two reviews that included observational studies did not report follow -up duration.64,66 Outcome characteristics and trends For this evidence scan, sarcopenia itself was included as an outcome, as well as muscle mass and muscle strength outcomes that make up the definition of sarcopenia. Four reviews evaluated muscle strength outcomes , 64,66,67 four reviews evaluated muscle mass outcomes ,53,65-67 and one review evaluated sarcopenia overall .66 There were all null results across reviews for upper -limb and lower -limb muscle strength53,64,66,67 aside from a positive relationship in one review for handgrip strength (but only when combined with exercise in frail/sarcopenic populations) .67 Two reviews had trends towards a positive relationship for lean muscle mass gain and for skeletal muscle mass53,65 and the other two muscle mass reviews found only null relationships .66,67 The review evaluating protein intake and sarcopenia overall found inconclusive/mixed resul ts.66 Supplemental scans Sleep duration No reviews were found that met the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this supplemental scan. Appetite and satiety Four SRs examined the relationship between protein intake and appetite and satiety outcomes.68-71 Table 2-j shows the full extraction table with population, intervention/exposure, and outcome data for SR s reporting on appetite and satiety outcomes. Review and population characteristics Of the four SRs on appetite and satiety outcomes, two were conducted with MA68,70 and two were conducted without MA.69,71 All of the reviews predominantly included RCTs, with the number of relevant included studies ranging from 271 to approximately 41.70 The populations studied included adults and older adults in three reviews69-71 and older adults alone in one review.68 Two reviews focused on studies where 100 percent of partici pants were with overweight or obesity.69-71 P rotein intake and chronic disease risk nesr.usda.gov | 45 Intervention/exposure characteristics All reviews predominantly assessed interventions that altered protein intake.68-71 The two reviews focusing on individuals with overweight or obesity included interventions that were designed to induce weight loss.69-71 Two of the SR s assessed studies with acute intervention durations, ranging from immediate assessment of appetite and satiety following protein intake to approximately 3 hours following protein intake.68,70 All four SRs reported on longer -term interventions with durations ranging from 2 days to 34 months. Outcome characteristics and trends A variety of appetite and satiety related outcomes were assessed, including hunger, fullness, desire to eat, prospective food consumption, thoughts about food, satiety, and composite appetite score.68-71 For acute studies, the reviews reported mixed findings but there was a tendency towards higher protein intake increasing satiety and decreasing appetite. 68,70 For longer -term studies, the reviews reported mixed findings - primarily null or a positive effect of protein on satiety. Considerations for future DRI work As the DRI process moves forward at the guidance of the Working Group, the following may be important to consider as a result of this completed evidence scan: 1.This evidence scan describes a broad range of evidence related to total dietary protein intake an d c hronic disease risk. It is difficult to know how pivotal the role of protein intake is to these relationships and it is challenging to isolate the effect of protein from the effect of other macronutrients , m icronutrients, and bioactive substances. 2.Evidence was derived from existing systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and umbrella reviews identifi ed by a literature search in PubMed. Use of a broader range of bibliographic databases may hav e i dentified additional reviews. 3.Completing duplication assessment of the relevant studies included in each review according to the r eported outcome provided a rough estimate of the potentially included unique primary researc h ar ticles. However, future systematic reviews would need to consider differences i n i ntervention/exposure, database coverage, and assess the full inclusion/exclusion criteria used to identify and evaluate primary evidenc e. 4.M odifying the inclusion and exclusion criteria for each outcome would influence the strength and siz e of the r eviews. This includes modifications to the following criteria: date range; study design; health status of the participants; characteristics or scope of the intervention/exposure (e.g., weight loss interventions , ex panding scope to include protein source, duration of intervention, study/sample size); r ange of v alidated intermediate and health outcomes; and potential sources of confounding (e.g., s tudies t hat a ssess percent AMDR or describe full macronutrient distribution of the diet).

In or der to answer the research questions, a protocol was written to c larify the areas of interest and structure the questions in more detail. The analytic framework for the evidence scan examining protein intake requirements is presented in Figure 3-a. The analytic framework visually represents the overall scope of the evidence scan question and depicts the contributing elements that were considered. The intervention or exposure of interest wa s total daily protei n i ntake level or total daily intake of in dispensable amino valine). The comparator wa s a different levels of total daily protein intake level or a different total daily intake of indispensable AAs. The outcomes we re: total protei n r equirement as defined by the following indicators or criteria of adequacy - nitrogen balance method, factorial method, indicator amino acid method, mean protein intake of infants fed principally human milk [0-6 months ], m ean protein content of human milk [0-6 months]; indispensable AA requirement as defined by the followi ng i ndicators or criteria of adequacy - plasma AA response method, direct AA oxidation method, 24-hou r AA bal ance method, indicator AA oxidation method, mean AA intake of infants fed principally human milk [0- 6 m onths], mean AA content of human milk [0-6 months].

Analyti c framework for protein intake requirements Search for and select studies NESR analysts worked jointly with the Working Group to establish the final inclusion and exclusion criteria and literature search strategy, which are detailed in Table 3-a and Appendix 3-a , r espectively. In this evidence scan, initial searches had low precision, leading the team to choose to identify articles through citation mining, rather than a systematic search. P rotein intake requirements nesr.usda.gov | 68 The librarian identified a set of six relevant reports and systematic reviews on protein intake.a Then, using Scopus and Web of Science, the librarian extracted all of the articles cited in those six papers (one level of backward citation mining) and all of those articles which cited those papers (one level of forward citation mining). These extracted articles were checked for relevance (those which mentioned dietary, macronutrient, energy, protein, or amino acid intake or interventions); date (published after 2000); and publication type (proceedings and conference abstracts excluded). Using this method, the librarian identified 372 articles in the backward citation mining and 1,228 articles in the forward citation mining after de-duplication. Citation mining, while a useful strategy for mapping evidence in a subject area, searches within a small, contai ned sample, and is not an exhaustive search method. Table 3-a.

Data extraction was completed in DistillerSR by two analysts for each article. Any conflicts between analysts were reconciled between the two screeners. If necessary, a third analyst was consulted to resolve differences. The following data elements were extracted from each included article: Publication author and publication year Study design Population studied (life stage/age group) Outcome assessment method Outcome assessed (total protein or select AAs) No results were extracted from the included articles and no quality assessments were completed. Describe the evidence NESR analysts summarized the volume and characteristics of included studies to inform the following question: What is the average daily dietary protein intake requirement of apparently healt hy individuals by life st age and sex? What is the average daily intake requirement for individual indispensable amino acids of apparently healthy individuals by life stage and sex?P rotein intake requirements nesr.usda.gov | 71 The extracted data were summarized in written form, as well as presented visually in a table. The extracted information helped analysts and the Working Group understand the following: The volume and characteristics of research examining protein intake requirements The volume and characteristics of research examining indispensable AA intake requirements Considerations for future DRI work Considerations for future systematic reviews completed to inform the DRI process were were included in this evidence scan. Results Literature search and screening results Citation mining for the protein requirements evidence scan yielded 1,600 search results after the removal of duplicates and assessment of relevance (see Figure 3-b ). Dual -screening resulted in the exclusion of 1,455 abstracts, and 123 full -text articles. Reasons for full -text exclusion are in Appendix 3-b . The body of evidence included 22 articles: 10 ar ticles on total protein requirements 12 articles on indispensable AA r equirements Figure 3-b. Literature search and screen flowchart for protein intake requirements Protein intake requirements nesr.usda.gov | 72 Description of evidence Total protein requirement Ten articles examined total protein requirements.72-81 Of these, one article78 was found to have been cited in the 2005 IOM report on proteina. The evidence on total protein requirements is organized by age of the participants. Table 3-b shows the full extraction table with citation, protein requirement(s) assessed, outcome assessment method(s), population(s) examined, and study design(s) for articles reporting on total protein requirements. Children (2-12 y ears) One RCT examined total protein requirements in children (2- 12 years).73 Total protein requirements in this study were assessed using the indicator AA oxidation (IAAO) method. Adults (19-59 y ears) Two RCTs examined total protein requirements in adults (19- 59 years).74,81 One RCT was conducted with female participants only ,81 whereas one was conducted with male participants only .74 Both studies utilized the IAAO method to assess total protein requirements. Additionally, one of the RCTs included a MA of 29 studies that utilized the nitrogen balance method to assess total protein requirements .74 Adults (19-59 y ears) and older adults (60+ y ears) Two studies, one RCT72 and one SR with MA ,78 examined total protein requirements in a combined population of adults (19 -59 y ears) and older adults (60+ y ears). Both studies utilized the nitrogen balance method to assess total protein requirements. As previously noted, the SR with MA, which included 27 studies in the SR and 19 studies in the MA, was cited in the 2005 IOM report.78 Older adults (60+ y ears) Four studies, three RCTs75,77,80 and one SR,76 examined total protein requirements in older adults (60+ y ears). Among the RCTs, two were conducted with female participants ,75,80 whereas one was conducted with male participants .77 Further, two RCTs utilized the IAAO method to determine total protein requirements ,77,80 whereas one utilized the nitrogen balance method.75 The SR assessed studies that determined total protein requirements using the nitrogen balance and included one MA and 4 additional individual studi es. All age groups One SR reported on total protein requirements across all age groups from infancy to older adulthood.79 The number of included studies in the SR was not reported. Methods used to determine protein requirements that were summarized by the SR included the mean protein content of human milk, the factorial method, and the nitrogen balance method. Indispensable AA requirements Twelve articles examined indispensable AA requirements .82-93 Of these, six articles82,83,85 -88 were found to have been cited in the 2005 IOM report on proteinb. The evidence on indispensable AA requirements is organized by the type of AA.

P rotein intake requirements nesr.usda.gov | 73 Leucine One RCT examined leucine requirements in adult (19-59 y ears) males .86 This RCT used the 24-hour A A balance method, the direct AA oxidation method, and the nitrogen balance method to determine leucine requirements. This RCT was cited in the 2005 IOM report on protein. Lysine Four studies, three RCTs84,85,87 and 1 NRCT,83 examined lysine requirements in adults (19-59 y ears). One RCT had not been previously cited in the 2005 IOM report on protein.84 In this study, lysine requirements were assessed using the IAAO method and participants were limited to females .84 Of the three studies that had been cited in the 2005 IOM report on protein, two were conducted with male participants and utilized the IAAO and 24-hour indicator AA balance methods to determine lysine requirements, whereas one was conducted wi th both m ale and female participants and utilized the 24-hour AA balance and direct AA oxidation methods to deter mine lysine requirements. Methionine Two RCTs examined methionine requirements in adult (19-59 y ears) males .89,90 Both RCTs utilized the IAAO and 24-hour AA balance methods to determine methionine requirements. Neither study was cited in the 2005 IOM report on protein. Threonine Two RCTs examined threonine requirements in adults (19-59 y ears),82,88 both of which were cited in the 2005 IOM report. Both RCTs utilized the IAAO and 24 -hour indicator AA balance methods to determine threonine requirements. One RCT was conducted with male participants ,88 whereas one RCT included both male and female participants .82 Valine One RCT examined valine requirements in adult (19-59 y ears) males .91 This RCT utilized the IAAO and 24- hour indicator AA balance methods to determine valine requirements. This RCT was cited in the 2005 IOM report on protein. Total branch ed-chain AAs (BCAAs) Two RCTs examined the total requirement for BCAAs (isoleucine, leucine, valine) in adult (19-59 y ears) males Both RCTs utilized the IAAO method to determine BCAA requirements. Neither study was cited in the 2005 IOM report on protein. Considerations for future DRI work As the DRI process moves forward at the guidance of the Working Group, the following may be important to consider as a result of this completed evidence scan: 1.Relatively few studies or systematic reviews have been published on the topic of total protein or individual indispensable AA requirements since the completion of the 2005 IOM report on protein DRIs . M ost new evidence was focused on total protein requirements and assessed adults (19-59 years) a nd ol der adults (60+ years). Fewer new studies were available on individual indispensable AA requirements (6 RCTs) or in children (2-12 years; 1 RCT). No new evidence was identified foradolescents, toddlers, or infants except as part of a systematic review on total protein requirements across the lifes pan. 2.C itation mining, while a useful strategy for mapping evidence in a subject area, searches within a small , c ontained sample, and is not an exhaustive search method. Therefore, it is possible that there are Protein intake requirements nesr.usda.gov | 74 additional, relevant studies that have been published since the completion of the 2005 IOM report on protein DRIs that were not captured by this evidence scan. 3. A full systematic review to fully explore this topic may be beneficial to inform future DRI w ork. The information found through citation mining was thorough but was part of an abbreviated evidence scan procedure. A systematic review would potentially provide a stronger body of evidence on protein requirements. Protein intake requirements nesr.usda.gov | 75 Table 3-b.
