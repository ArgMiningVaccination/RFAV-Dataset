This paper explores legislation regarding maternity leave and its impact on breastfeeding, and how remote work (\"telework\"), is a plausible and sustainable supplement to maternity leave. Part I will discuss the importance of breastfeeding as a public health tool. Part II will examine legislation and policies relevant to breastfeeding. In Part III, the aforementioned policies will be critiq ued. In Part IV, positive policy examples will be evaluated, and in Part V, policies will be reframed with telework as a necessity to increase breastfeeding rates in the U.S. THE IMPORTANCE OF BREASTFEEDING AS A PUBLIC HEALTH TOOL Breastfed infants have a lower risk for many negative health outcomes including sudden infant death syndrome (\"SIDS\"), necrotizing enterocolitis, type two diabetes, asthma, and childhood obesity.10 In addition, mothers who breastfeed are at a lower risk for ovarian and breast c ancers11 and have lower 7 Rui Huang & Muzhe Yang, Paid Maternity Leave and Breastfeeding Practice Before and After California's Implementation of the Nation's First Paid Family Leave Program , 16 ECON. & HUMAN BIOLOGY 45, 56 (2015). 8 Kelsey Mirkovic et al., Paid Mater nity Leave and Breastfeeding Outcomes , 43 BIRTH 233, 233 (2016). 9 Hauck et al., supra note 6, at 2. 10Mirkovic et al., supra note 8. 11 Id. 2020 Breastfeeding and Telew ork 103 reported incidence of endometrial and thyroid cancers.12 Conversely, there are dangers of formula feeding. Infants who are fed formula at four months are over 250% more likely to be hospitalized for lower respiratory tract disease in the first year of life than breastfed infants.13 Formula feeding can also lead to short -term infections such as diarrhea and ear infections.14 The benefits of breastfeeding are not only applicable to individuals' health, but also the economic health of the healthcare system. Low breastfeeding rates add an estimated $2.2 billion per year to direct medical costs in the U.S.15 One study found that , if ninety percent of U.S. families followed breastfeeding guidelines, the U.S. would save $13 billion annually from reduced direct medical and indirect costs of premature death.16 With ninety percent breastfeeding compliance, $4.7 billion would be saved just on costs relating SIDS and an additional $2.6 billion in costs relating to necrotizing enterocolitis.17 Similarly, with an eighty percent breastfeeding compliance rate, $10.5 billion per year would be saved.18 In addition to direct medical costs, o ther costs of noncompliance with breastfeeding guidelines include lower productivity in terms of less employee time off to take care of a sick child,19 formula costs, and increased insurance costs.20 Ninety percent compliance could also save $3.9 billion on infant formula.21 In addition, 12 Adetola Louis -Jacques & Alison Stuebe, Enabling Brea stfeeding to Support Lifelong Health for Mother and Child , 47 OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY CLINICS OF N .

CURRENT LEGISLATION AND POLICIES THAT IMPACT BREASTFEEDING There is a clear relationship bet ween economics and health that is currently neglected in U.S. maternity leave policies. The U.S. is the only advanced, industrialized nation without a federal law providing new mothers paid leave.23 Employees in the U.S. primarily rely on employer polici es to provide paid leave for family and medical reasons.24 However , only fifteen percent of U.S. workers in 2017 had access to employer -sponsored paid family leave, according to the National Compensation Survey (\"NCS\"), which defines paid family leave as \"leave to care for a newborn child, an adopted child, a sick child, or a sick adult relative.\"25 Considering that most of the population does not receive employer -sponsored paid leave, effective legislation is crucial to improving breastfeeding r ates. Federal legislation that influences breastfeeding include the Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\"), the Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\"), Medicaid, and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (\"WIC\").26 22 Id. 23 BLS Staff, How Paid Family Leave Affects Mothers in the Labor Force , BLS.GOV (Mar. 24 Ann Bartel et al., Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Access to and use of Paid Family and Medical Leave: Evidence from four Nationally Representative supra note 17, at 1072. 2020 Breastfeeding and Telew ork 105 FMLA was ena cted in 199327 and requires companies with fifty or more employees to provide twelve unpaid weeks of leave for various family matters, including parental leave.28 However, this is an inequitable approach because lower wage, seasonal, and part -time workers are less likely to qualify for FMLA benefits29 and those in lower paid jobs are more likely to return to work earlier.30 The FMLA therefore likely benefits mothers who are of higher income and can afford to take unpaid time off, and does not benefit low-income mothers. In fact, a main reason why family leave is not taken is loss of income.31 As a consequence, in 2012, twenty -three percent of working women returned to the workplace within only ten days of giving birth.32 The ACA has two provisions that influence breastfeeding.33 In 2012, it was mandated that non -grandfathered, private health insurance must provide certain coverage for breastfeeding, including lactation support, counseling, and breastfeeding equipment.34 Notably, these changes typically do not benefit low -income individuals insured under Medicaid, which is a government -funded entitlement program35 for those who may not be able to afford health insurance. Further, there is a \"Break Time for Nursing Mothers\" law under the ACA, where employers must allow unpaid brea k time to express milk for one year after birth, in a private space that is not a 27 Hauck et al., supra note 6, at 2. 28 U.S. BUREAU OF LABOR STAT., EMPLOYEE BENEFITS SURVEY , BLS https://www.bls. gov/ ncs/ebs/factsheet/family 2019). 29 Bidisha Mandal e t al., The Differential Effects of Full-Time and Part-Time Work Status on Breastfeeding , 97 HEALTH POL'Y,79, 84 (2010). 30 Hauck et al., supra note 6, at 2. 31 Huang & Yang, supra note 7, at 46. 32 Louis -Jacques & Stuebe, supra note 12, at 376. 33 Hawkins et al., supra note 17, at 1074 -1075. 34 Kandice Kapinos et al., Lactation Support Services and Breastfeeding Initiation: Evidence from the Affordable Care Act Tami Gu rley-Calvez et al., Effect of the Affordable Care Act on Breastfeeding Outcomes , 2 AM.

ISSUES WITH CURRENT LEGISLATION Current legislation reflects and exacerbates racial and socioeconomic influences on breastfeeding rates. Women of color are less likely to breastfee d and infants of color are less likely to be breastfed, and therefore, do not benefit from the associated health outcomes.46 African American mothers have the lowest breastfeeding rates at only 17.2%.47 Notably, existing policies to support breastfeeding do not include language on race, ethnicity, income, or education.48 Another important factor in considering maternity leave is the shift in the U.S. workforce that has occurred over the last several decades. In 2010, women with children under the age of eighteen in the workforce was 71.3%49 compared to 47.5% in 1975.50 This increase of women's employment has not been reflected by changes in paid leave. An overarching issue of relevant policies is that they do not apply to all employees, which leaves mot hers in lower paying occupations returning to work earlier.51 National survey findings are consistent with evidence that the \"FMLA has provided health benefits to infants of highly educated and married women, \" but not to infants of less advantaged mothers.52 Similarly, the ACA presents a gap in coverage because Medicaid recipients are typically 45 Hauck et al., supra note 6, at 1. 46 Neelon et al, supra note 39, at 908. 47 Hauck et al., supra note 6, at 2. 48 Neelon et al, supra note 39, at 909. 49 BLS Staff, supra note 23. 50 Id. 51 Hauck et al., supra note 6, at 2. 52 Bartel et al., supra note 24. 108 Advance Directive Vol. 30 excluded from ACA breastfeeding support53 and Medicaid traditionally has not been required to provide lactation suppo rt.54 Neither the Medicaid statute nor the Federal Medicaid regulations specifically mention lactation services, and state coverage varies widely,55 where only fourteen states cover breastfeeding education, twelve states cover lactation consultations, and thirty -nine states include a provision of a breast pump.56 Medicaid also presents a disparity in coverage, where racial and ethnic minorities constitute forty -seven percent of eligible individuals, although they only constitute thirty -seven percent of the U.S. population.57 Minorities' heightened reliance on Medicaid is problematic because, although the ACA offers limited benefits, Medicaid has no minimum required lactation benefits58 and s tate variance in Medicaid services59 is likely to have differentia l impacts on coverage of racial groups.60 This issue is particularly complex because the increase of insured patients is typically believed to improve health outcomes, however, the absence of any breastfeeding protection under Medicaid may have contradict ory results for those reliant on Medicaid, especially for minority groups. Another issue with the ACA is that it tends to only cover hourly employees, not salaried employees.61 Since the ACA employer health insurance mandate applies to individuals who wo rk more than thirty hours a week,62 yet another gap in coverage is created for those who do not work the minimum number of hours required to qualify for ACA benefits.

LETTERS , 222, 222 (2016). 2020 Breastfeeding and Telew ork 109 ACA is applicable, breastfeeding \"support, supplies, and counseling\" are not well defined, creating variation among insurance policies.63 In considering issues of Medicaid and the ACA, it is crucial to note that the relationship between these policies leaves some mothers falling through the cracks between affording insurance and earning too much to qualify for Medicaid.64 The lack of uniformity of access to ACA benefits presents an issue of utilizing the ACA, and as a result, Medicaid, to increase breastfeeding rates. Although WIC has the most inclusive language of breastfeeding services, it is a grant -based program that relies on limited resources, which creates a need of prioritization.65 Approximately seventeen percent of women may be eligible for WIC but are not enrolled,66 which may mean a greater enrollment for WIC could lower access and quality of breastfeeding support without an increase of federal funds. Another consideration is a possible negative correlation between WIC participation and breastfeeding.67 Although WIC encourages breastfeeding, it also pr ovides packages for supplemental formula.68 As formula is typically expensive, it has been theorized that this unintentionally incentivizes formula feeding by creating an image of a valuable product that one may not be able to afford without WIC.69 Altho ugh not an established cause, studies have found a correlation with low rates of breastfeeding under WIC.70 63 Hawkins et al., supra note 17, at 1075. 64 Id. at 1087. 65 Id. at 1080. 66 Id. 67 COLEMAN ET AL ., supra note 41, at 29. 68 Id. at 3. 69 Id. 70 Id. at 29. 110 Advance Directive Vol. 30 EXAMPLES OF EFFECTIVE LEGISLATION California was the first state to offer a partially paid family leave (\"PFL\") law in 2004.71 As an extension of state disability insurance (\"SDI\"), employees covered with SDI also have PFL.72 Although only partially paid, PFL increased overall maternity leave in California from three to six weeks, with large increases for non -college -educated, unmarried, Black, an d Hispanic mothers.73 After California enacted PFL, breastfeeding rates at six months increased by 17.4%.74 This is a substantial increase given that many women, mostly young, non -white, less -educated, low -income, and those without employer paid leave, d id not know about this law.75 Therefore, this lack of knowledge may indicate that PFL likely had potential for even greater increased breastfeeding rates than what was observed if more mothers had known about it. In 2020, Washington implemented the Paid Family and Medical Leave Program, which is a state -run insurance benefit.76 This program allows most employees77 to receive up to twelve weeks of paid leave for, among other circumstances, bonding after birth.78 Unlike sick leave and accrued time off, the Paid Family and Medical Leave Program is not an employer provided benefit, but rather provided through the Empl oyment Security Department, which creates no additional costs to employers.79 Another benefit to this 71 Huang & Yang, supra note 7. 72 Id. at 47. 73 Id. at 56. 74 Id. at 51. 75 Bartel et al., supra note 24. 76 Paid Family & Medical Leave, WASH.

Crucial to note is that returning to work full -time decreases breastfeeding rates, yet part -time work does not.84 This dichotomy presents a balance between insurance benefits of full-time employment and breastfeeding benefits of part -time employment. TELEWORK AS A NECESSARY COMPONENT OF WORK LEAVE POLICIES TO PROMOTE BREASTFEEDING Part-time work presents higher rates of breastfeeding initiation and duration compared to full -time work.85 Full-time working mothers utilizing telework, when compared to p art-time work, likely would allow for the same space, time,86 and comfort to breastfeed while working from home, while still allowing for health insurance coverage as a full -time employee. Telework appeals to both productivity and economic strength while providing mothers with the ability to breastfeed. 80 Paid Family & Medical Leave , supra note 77. 81 Id. 82 Kapinos et al., supra note 34, at 2175. 83 Mathur et al., supra note 62. 84 Mandal et al., supra note 29. 85 Id. 86 Alan Ryan et al., The Effect of Employment Status on Breastfeeding in the United States , 16 WOMEN 'S HEALTH ISSUES 243, 249 (2006) (explaining that obstacles in the workplace include space, time, and support from co -workers and employers). 112 Advance Directive Vol. 30 Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (\"BLS\") indicates that forty - five percent of U.S. employees are in occupations in which telework is feasible.87 However, a much lower percentage of employees, between twenty -two and twenty -five percent, actually worked from home prior to the COVID -19 pandemic.88 Therefore, there are employees who may not have traditionally worked from home, but indeed have the ability to do so. Telework has proven to be successful in the U.S. through qualitative evidence from both employers and employees.89 The forward -thinking and dynamic workplace ideologies implemented as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic should serve to reframe materni ty leave legislation. Currently, there is no national quantitative data about productivity with remote work, however, the BLS is monitoring productivity and costs90, and when data becomes available, this information can be used to further assess this prop osition. Similar to aforementioned critiques of other policies, telework is not an available option to all employees91 and higher education is positively correlated to an ability to telework.92 Therefore, mothers who are in lower paying jobs or have less education that are already excluded from paid leave policies93 possibly would not have the ability to telework. Data also shows racial disparities in ability to telework, where there is close t o a sixteen percent difference in the highest and lowest rates of access to telework between Hispanic, Black, and white employees.94 Despite these drawbacks, data indicates that roughly forty -eight to fifty -one percent of women have the 87 Ability to Work From Home: Evidence From Two Surveys and Implications for the Labor Market in the COVID -19 Pandemic , U.S. BUREAU LABOR STAT.

In addition, telework may become more widely utilized as the pandemic continues and even after, possibly increasing the proportion of women who have an ability to telework. Integration of telework into legislation requires an examination of applicability and compatibility. Since the FMLA only provid es unpaid leave rather than paid leave,96 telework may not fall into this legislation. On the other hand, since the ACA is federally mandated, only with Medicaid and insurance exclusions,97 it could make telework a far reaching candidate of lactation supp ort under the broad definitions and language of the Act.98 An integration of telework into state policies, like seen in California and Washington, likely would prove to be successful given the large increase in breastfeeding rates in California after enac ting PFL.99 However, adjustment of the ACA to include telework may be more effective, due to the advantage of federal laws over state laws in creating more uniform protection, rather than a patchwork commitment to breastfeeding.100 Where the ACA does not cover, Medicaid, will require expansion in order to provide breastfeeding support, including telework. Telework as an option for maternity leave also requires a change in employer policies, considering that paid leave is typically controlled by employers.101 Employers that support breastfeeding through policies benefit through reduced maternity leave and absenteeism, 95 Id. 96 Hauck et al., supra note 6, at 2. 97 Hawkins et al., supra note 17, at 1078. 98 Mathur et al., supra note 62. 99 Huang & Yang, supra note 7, at 51. 100 Hawkins et al., supra note 17, at 1078. 101 Bartel et al., supra note 24. 114 Advance Directive Vol. 30 higher productivity, and lower healthcare costs.102 As a change in a positive direction, several companies have allowed some employees work from home indefinitely,103 which supports the proposition of telework for breastfeeding as a long -term solution as opposed to a temporary circumstance. CONCLUSION Legislation regarding telework as a form of paid leave for new mothers should follow the large shift to remote work as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic. This solution possesses possible benefits of increased breastfeeding rates, as seen in unemployed and part-time employment, coupled with productivity of full -time employees, appealing to economic arguments against paid maternity leave. The COVID -19 pandemic exemplified that it is possible for many Americans to telework, and this should be utilized to inc rease breastfeeding as a public health tool. 102 Hauck et al., supra note 6, at 2. 103 Joey Hadden et al., 20 Major Companies that have Announced Employees can work Remotely long -term, BUS.

THE COST OF DIRECT -TO-CONSUMER DRUG ADVERTISING FOR PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES Pharmaceutical Company Marketing and Marketing Budgets Pharmaceutical companies apportion their budget to ensure that they can beneficially research, develop, and market their innovations.17 Most of the marketing budget is specifically geared towards reaching those with prescribing privilege, such as doctors.18 Direct -to-consumer marketing, however, also sec ures a large portion of marketing budgets, and focuses more on drugs that can be obtained over the counter (\"OTC\") and \"common - ailment targeted prescription drugs.\"19 Direct -to-consumer advertising can occur on the radio, on television, in magazines, and on the internet.20 Direct - to-consumer advertising, in comparison with advertising to doctors, removes 17 Id. 18 Joan Buckley, Pharmaceutical Marketing - Time for Change, 9 ELECTRONIC J.

DeLauro could have considered a shorter -term for a moratorium to not impede so strongly and for so long on pharmaceutical company's first amendment rights.47 Additionally, and likely more importantly, is the framing of the issues that Rep. DeLauro presented, that misinformation by the pharmaceutical companies was the problem.48 If, instead, the issue had been framed as changing how pharmac eutical companies advertised, or possibly a regulation on what can or cannot be advertised; that could have been an entirely different bill.49 DTCA focuses on emotional advertising, playing to people's fears and feelings, as opposed to educational adverti sing, which empowers and informs patients.50 42 Id. 43 Id. 44 Patricia Guthrie, Direct -to-Consumer Advertising Debated in the United States and European Union , 176 CMAJ 1404, 1404 (2007). 45 Id. 46 Janelle Applequist & Jennifer Gerard Ball, An Updated Analysis of Direct -to-Consumer Television Advertisements for Prescription Drugs , 16 ANNALS FAM .

Public Service Commission , is a four-part test for whether governmental regulation of commercial free speech is constitutional.55 For commercial free speech to be considered protected speech, the speech cannot be misleading and must concern only lawful activity.56 If the commercial free speech passes this first part and is considered speech, a court will then us e the following steps (steps 2 -4) to decide if the regulation of the particular commercial free speech is 51 Mark I.

A Moratorium During a Global Pandemic There should be an immediate and short -term moratorium on direct -to- consumer drug advertising while the world faces a global pandemic and attempts to create a safe and effective vaccine.72 It is possible to enact this moratorium by writing a bill that could become law, an executive order from the federal or state government, or by agreed -upon internal industry regulation.73 States must incentivize the pharmaceutical companies if states truly want to make changes that promote public health, health justice, and accessibility.74 As our system operates now, there is too much room for 67 Id. 68 Id. 69 Id. 70 Id. 71 Id. 72 Id. 73 See Press Release, Rosa DeLauro, supra note 41. 74 Ahmadiani & Nikfar , supra note 10, at 6. 2020 Alternatives to Drug Advertising 125 misinformation and errors in self -diagnosis due to the prevalence of direct - to-consumer advertising.75 Further, the amount of money spent o n marketing drugs to consumers could be better spent on public health initiatives or addressing the global pandemic.76 The pandemic plays a unique role in its effect of the application of the four-part Hudson test regarding commercial free speech and whe ther the government can regulate it.77 Pharmaceutical advertising is commercial free speech as protected by the First Amendment; it concerns lawful activity and is likely not misleading.78 It would not be misleading because the purpose of the moratorium would not be to deceive the public or spread information, but to instead either inform them of anti -COVID -19 measures or to otherwise promote public health initiatives. This would satisfy the first part of the four - part test. Second, the government has asserted that the interest in regulating the speech must be substantial; in this case, it is self -evident that a global pandemic is substantial.79 Third, utilizing the reach of pharmaceutical marketing and advertising would reach consumers, and directly a dvance the governmental interest asserted: to inform the public of the COVID -19 pandemic, public health alerts, and, eventually, treatments and vaccinations available to protected against COVID -19.80 The governmental regulation could advance both public h ealth and governmental interests amid a global pandemic.

Fourth and finally, a regulation that would impose a moratorium on advertising in the name of spending the advertising dollars either to inform the public of COVID -19 or spending the advertising dollars on finding a cure for COVID -19, would not be more extensive than is necessary to serve the interest expressed in the previous step.81 The government must not overstep, but instead must attempt to serve health justice during a global pandemic and a world fraught with misinformation.82 Meeting all fo ur of the Hudson Test criterion, a moratorium on DTCA in the name of either using the marketing channels to inform the public of the COVID -19 pandemic and how to stay safe; or, using the marketing budget financing to develop a COVID -19 vaccine, would allow for constitutional governmental regulation of commercial free speech.83 Commercial Duty During a Global Pandemic The pharmaceutical industry has a duty to provide affordable access to treatments as well as a duty to provide adequate and accurate informati on to the public.84 COVID -19 has impacted the pharmaceutical industry, shifting rules and regulations as countries race to try and find a safe and effective vaccine for the virus.85 Recently, short term rules and regulations have shifted to create a vaccine and pharmaceutical budgets have shifted to attempt to meet the demand for a vaccine for COVID -19.86 However, in the long - 81 Id. 82 Jeffrey Kluger, The Misinformation Age Has Exacerbated - and Been Exacerbated - by the Coronavirus, TIME (July 23, 2020), https://time.com/5870464/coronavirus -pandemic - misinformation/. 83 See Commercial Speech , supra note 55. 84 Id. 85 Ayati et al., Short and Long Term Impacts of COVID -19 on the Pharmaceutical Sector , DARU J.

Taking into consideration a global pandemic, this article proposes a short -term moratorium on direct -to-consumer advertising in an effort to promote public health efforts, focus funds and efforts on creating a safe and effective vaccine, an attempt to de -commercialize diagnosis and treatment for patients, in the name of the legal duty assumed by pharmaceutical company's role to uphold health justice during a public health crisis. This moratorium will allow for pharmaceutical companies to assume their assigned legal and human rights principled duty and responsibility to improve healthcare and provid e innovation in a time of need, utilizing their vehicles of communication with communities, while also de - monetizing and reevaluating the ethics of marketing drugs directly to patients. While only a short -term solution, this governmental regulation of commercial free speech is likely to promote health justice during the COVID - 19 global pandemic. 129 State Medicaid Reimbursement for Remote Patient Monitoring and Interactive Communication Will Help Reduce Health Care Gap Among Black and White People with Pr eexisting Conditions that Put Them at Increased Risk of Severe Illness from COVID -19 Victoria Bethel INTRODUCTION In the United States, black people with preexisting conditions are disproportionately facing the COVID -19 death sentence.1 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of August 2020, black people have a 2.6 times higher contraction rate, 4.7 times higher hospitalization rate, and 2.1 times higher death rate from COVID -19 than white people.2 The enduring r acial disparities in health care contribute to COVID -19's disproportionate impact.3 Black people have a higher prevalence of the underlying medical conditions that increase a person's risk of severe illness from COVID -19, which include hypertension and di abetes.4 From 2017 to 2018, the 1 Don Tai et al., The Disproportionate Impact of COVID -19 on Racial and Ethnic Minorities in the United States, 2020 CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES 1, 1. 2 Hospitalization and Death by Race/Ethnicity , CTRS.

CHAs identify \" key health needs and issues through systematic, comprehensive data collection and anal ysis.\"29 People with uncontrolled, chronic conditions such as hypertension and diabetes are at higher risk of developing severe illness from COVID -19 than those whose chronic conditions are well -managed.30 CHAs may help identify whether uncontrolled hype rtension and diabetes are contributing to the disproportionate prevalence of severe illness from COVID -19 among black patients. 29 What is a Community Health Assessment?, CTRS.

For secondary data, the electronic health record data offers a \"unique window into the health needs of community mem bers who have received care.\"34 In gathering data from the patient's record, such as ventilator use and intensive care unit admission, the hospitals will be able to assess the severity of COVID -19's impact on the patient. If various hospitals in a state determine that control of chronic conditions among black patients is a significant community health need, then that state's Medicaid program should provide reimbursement for RPM.35 When deciding on strategies, to make an impact at the population level, hospitals can implement strategies that get at the root of the health need.36 Clinical interventions that promote accountability and incentivize meaningful outcomes (e.g., blood pressure and blood glucose control) are essential to 31 Community Health Assessment Toolkit Step 4: Collect and Analyze Data , AHA CMTY.

State Medicaid programs should also require and reimburse for interactive communication between the patient and provider to provide feedback.45 According to Dr. Winston Wong of the UCLA Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Equity, improving control of chronic conditions among minority patients \"requires a continuous care relatio nship that builds around trust.\"46 The methods of interactive communication should include videoconferences due to some of the telemedicine -related concerns black study participants have expressed.47 For instance, some black people have concerns that if the physician is physically absent, they will be unable to look the physician in the eye and determine if he or she is telling them the truth.48 Interactive communication gives providers an opportunity to assess what patient -related perceptions cause thei r black patients' medication nonadherence. Culturally based perceptions of medication and illness significantly influence medication nonadherence among black people with chronic conditions.49 According to a systematic review of black peoples' beliefs about hypertension and its treatment, some black people fear and or 44 Spanakis & Golden, supra note 42, at 816. 45 Bryant, supra note 18 (discussing CPT Code 99457: Remote physiologic monitoring treatment management services, clinical staff/physician/other qualified healthcare professional time in a calendar month, requiring interactive communication with the patient/caregiver during the month; first 20 minutes; and CPT Code 99457: Each additional 20 minutes). 46 Hostetter & Klein, supra note 39. 47 Sheba M.

Interactive communication can also give providers an opportunity to educate their black patients, which is vital because an educated and informed black patient will be better able to effectively use health care services.57 When educating black patients, providers must take into consideration that forty percent of black people have poor reading skills, and consequently lack health literacy, the ability to understand basic health information.58 People who lack health literacy also struggle to communicate with their providers 50 Leo Buckley et al., A Systematic Review of Beliefs About Hype rtension and its Treatment Among African Americans , 18 CURRENT HYPERTENSION REP. 1, 7 (2016). 51 Id. 52 Id. at 3. 53 Id. at 3-4. 54 Shiyanbola et al., supra note 49, at 412. 55 Id. at 410. 56 Id. at 410 -413. 57 Allan S.

The CHAs can help determine whether poor condition management is a si gnificant issue among black patients with hypertension and diabetes and if so, then the state's Medicaid program should reimburse for RPM of these conditions. Providers should be required to interactively communicate with the patient, as means to build th eir black patients' trust and educate them.

The United States already recognizes housing as a human right as a signatory to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (\"ICESCR\") of 1966.21 This article will examine the existing policies and practices that have contributed to the ongoing homelessness crisis and give insight towards potential solutions to curb the continuous rise in homelessness. Part I of this article provided the background on homelessness and its increasing prevalence as a public health crisis in the United States. Part II discusses the impact of homeless criminalization laws, their enforcement practices, and how those policies are both costly and ineffective. Subsequently, Part III examines the \"Homeless Bill of Rights\" legislation that has been introduced in several states as a method to reduce and prevent the enactment of laws and ordinances criminalizing acts the homeless commonly conduct. Finally, Part IV discusses the large savings of taxpa yer money and reduction of costly emergency medical services that stems from housing homeless individuals in accordance with the Housing First model. CRIMINALIZATION AND ITS COSTS The first piece to a potential solution to the homelessness crisis in the United States starts with understanding the costs incurred by enforcing laws which criminalize homeless acts. As cities across the United States continue to enact legislation designed to remove the visibly homeless from public spaces, the cities create addi tional costs associated with the new policies.22 For example, the city of Los Angeles spends over 100 million dollars each year on patrolling, arresting, and providing mental health interventions to 21 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 1966 art. 11, opened for signature Dec. 16, 1966, U.N.T.S. 993 (detailing that while the U.S. is a si gnatory party, it has yet to ratify the treaty). 22 Gale Holland, L.A. Spends $100 Million a Year on Homelessness, City Report Finds , L.A. TIMES (Apr. 16, 2015), https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la -me-ln-homeless -cao-report - 20150416 -story.html. 2020 Homelessness and Health Justice 147 homeless individuals.23 Of that amount approximately th irty million dollars is spent on \"sweeps\" which evict homeless individuals with little or no notice out of homeless encampments, uprooting shelters and adding additional instability into their lives.24 Often times these sweeps result in the destruction of the homeless individual's property \u2014such as legal documents, medical devices, and clothing \u2014leading to legal and medical issues increasing the costs associated with the enforcement of criminalization laws and subsequent lawsuits.25 Another example of crimin alization and its costs comes from the city of Portland, Oregon which reported in 2017 that over half of all people arrested were individuals experiencing homelessness.26 Considering that on average, the cost of incarcerating a single person for a year am ounts to a staggering $47,057, these policies can quickly cost taxpayers extraordinary amounts of money which could be used to fund other programs.27 Despite the massive costs associated with enforcing homeless criminalization laws, the National Law Cente r on Homelessness and Poverty reports that the efforts to continue criminalizing homelessness and put these laws on the books has increased in every category that the organization had measured nationwide and has been on the rise for the past thirteen years .28 As a result, research suggests that individuals who have experienced homelessness for over a year \u2014the \"chronically homelessness\" \u2014cost taxpayers approximately $83,000 per homeless person each year.29 With criminalization showing increasing prevalence, it is logical that this figure 23 Id. 24 NAT'L L.

The introduction of a \"Homeless Bill of Rights\" was signed into law on June 20, 2 012 in Rhode Island making it the first state -level law to protect the civil rights of homeless individuals.42 A unique feature of the legislation was that the law provides several benefits to 38 Blake v.

Moreover, the Ninth Circuit Court of A ppeals in the case of Martin v. City of Boise addressed the question of whether cities can enforce punitive measures against homeless people in cases where there is no reasonable alternative but to commit the criminalized act in public spaces.51 The court held that Boise could not criminalize homeless people for sleeping on public property \"on the false pretense [homeless persons] had a choice in the matter.\"52 The false pretense in Martin was that, while shelter beds were available, religious requir ements had to be met to attain a bed, and since those religious requirements presented a barrier to entry for homeless individuals of a different faith, those beds were not actually available.53 Therefore, the court found that criminalizing homeless peopl e for not sleeping in beds that were unavailable to them was deemed cruel and unusual punishment and a violation of their Eighth Amendment rights.54 The Ninth Circuit is particularly relevant and well -suited to address this question since many of the West ern States within the circuit are heavily impacted by homelessness.55 Both this decision and the prevalence of successful legal challenges brought forth by homeless individuals asserting their rights against criminalization policies stands to show the importance of establishing a federal \"Homeless Bill of Rights\" to further civil protections for homeless individuals.56 51 Sara K.

The term \"telehealth\" describes the vast array of services that doctors are now able to provide remotely such as diagnosing, monitoring, and educating patients or physicians.1 Relatedly, the term \"telemedicine\" is a more narrow term describing on ly the clinical aspects of doctoring.2 This paper discusses telehealth as it is the more general term and covers more types of services patients may receive through the use of technology.3 Telehealth laws vary widely at the state level.4 Some states, including Minnesota, require practitioners to get a specialized telehealth license.5 Other states, such as Maryland, require private insurers to cover telehealth services, while still other states like Alabama have no laws to stop private insurer s from denying coverage of telehealth services.6 This large disparity is problematic because it leads to residents of different states having unequal medical options available to them, which will lead to long lasting health disparities in populations.7 This inconsistency between states exemplifies the need for a 1 Jeremy Sherer & Amy Joseph, Physician Law Evolving Trends and Hot Topics: Telehealth , 32 HEALTH L. 20, 20 (2020). 2 Id. 3 Id. 4 App. B -11.

The COVID -19 public health emergency has reignited discussions around telehealt h services.8 Public health emergencies involving contagious diseases highlight the benefits of telehealth practices, such as allowing patients to receive treatment while also social distancing to reduce the spreading of the aforementioned diseases.9 However, access to telehealth services is critical to ensuring adequate access to health care, even in the absence of a public health emergency, particularly for residents who live in rural communities \u2014fifteen to twenty percent of the United States populat ion.10 A common theme throughout rural U.S. communities is substandard health.11 For example, in 2014 more people died per capita from the five leading causes of death \u2014heart disease, cancer, unintentional injury, chronic lower respiratory disease, and st roke\u2014in Nonmetropolitan areas compared to Metropolitan areas.12 These rural health disparities can be compounded by other health inequalities, such as the disparities that exist for racial minorities.13 For example, African Americans and American Indian/ Alaskan Native adults are more likely to have multiple chronic health conditions compared to non -Hispanic white populations.14 Causes of rural health inequalities are numerous.15 These areas often have higher rates of poverty and uninsured or underinsured.16 Counties labeled as 8 Anthony C.

This article argues a national law requiring telehealth services to be covered by insurance providers should be implemented to create better outcomes for those living in rural areas.20 First, thi s article will address the benefits of telehealth coverage \u2014both during and not during a public health emergency. Next, this article will dive into the distinct challenges faced in rural areas that leads to disproportionately negative health effects when t elehealth is not covered. This article will also address some of the struggles of telehealth coverage, particularly in rural areas. Finally, this article will propose some solutions to overcoming these burdens and ultimately make the case that a federal law should be passed requiring telehealth services to be covered by insurers nationally. 17 Jennifer Cheeseman Day, Rates of Uninsured Fall in Rural Counties, Remain Higher Than Urban Counties , U.S. CENSUS BUREAU (Apr. 9, 2019), https://www.census.gov/ library/stories/2019/04/health -insurance -rural -america.html. 18 Graves, supra note 15. 19 Id. 20 See Kiley Aycock, Just a Phone Call Away: Should Texas Require Insurance Providers to Cover Telehealth Services? , 19 TEX.

Telemedicine leads to a timely diagnosis and early treatment of a patient which will 'often result in improved outcomes and less expenses.'\"). 160 Advance Directive Vol. 30 BENEFITS AND OBSTACLES OF TELEHEALTH COVERAGE Telehealth services have numerous benefits, the most important of which is the ability to increase access to health care and reduce costs \u2014regardless of the existence of a public health emergency.21 During a public health emergency involving infectious diseases, telehealth becomes an even more necessary tool because it allows patients to receive care without putting themselv es or others at risk.22 Though recent telehealth discussion has been centered on the COVID -19 pandemic, telehealth has also been used during natural disasters such as hurricanes.23 The previous benefits are applicable to exigent situations, but telehealth also provides advantages under normal circumstances. First, telehealth is extremely convenient; many people face frustrating travel times and wait times to access a physician.24 Telehealth from home services remove all travel time. Second, telehealth can open up opportunities to see specialists that are not present in a region.25 An individual's access to specialists varies drastically depending on location.26 According to the National Rural Health Association, \"there are only 30 specialists per 100,000 people in rural communities, compared to 263 specialists per 100,000 urban residents.\"27 This is not solely a problem with highly unique forms of specialists.28 The same disparity exists with primary care physicians as well\u201455.1 per 100,000 residents in rural areas and 79.3 per 100,000 in urban areas.29 Additionally, a study in 2017 found that \"54% of rural counties did not have a hospital with 21 Ray E.

Another potential benefit of making telehealth a larger part of the medical industry is a reduction in costs.31 Telehealth services have outcomes that equal or surpass traditional in -person care.32 One study concluded that video telehealth was, \"cost -effective for home care and access to on -call hospital specialists.\"33 The study concluded that video telehealth services can be cost effective for \"regional and rural health care,\" however, the technolo gy being used and the clinical discipline could cause this to vary.34 Telehealth services may not always be the most cost effective way to treat an illness, but evidence has shown it can be an efficient alternative.35 More importantly, it may be the only way to get timely access to the type of care individuals need.36 DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECTS ON RURAL COMMUNITIES Rural areas have a different medical landscape compared to urban areas.37 Telehealth is the first step to putting rural and urban areas on more equal footing in regard to health access and outcomes.38 In particular, telehealth may create more benefits in rural areas than in urban settings.39 This is a result of the unequal distribution of physicians and specialists in rural areas.40 It is likely that those living in rural areas would have further to travel to 30 Id. 31 Victoria A.

However, other laws may complicate issues as well.66 While many states do require telehealth services to be covered by private insurers, there are differences in what procedures potential providers have to go through.67 For example, while most states only require a phy sician to have a license to practice in the state, Georgia requires a separate telehealth license.68 One federal law which makes coverage of telehealth services consistent throughout all the states would encourage expansion of the infrastructure necessary for telehealth services. It is a risk to invest in the expansion of telehealth services when state l aws are inconsistent.69 Telemedicine companies would feel safer investing into making telemedicine more accessible and efficient if they had one set of laws to follow instead of fifty.70 61 Id. 62 Id. 63 Id. 64 See generally Telemedicine Laws, supra note 4 (providing comparison of laws that vary from state to state). 65 Id. 66 Id. 67 Id. 68 Id. 69 Id. 70 Id. 2020 Mandatory Telehealth Coverage 165 SOLUTIONS TO OVERCOMING TELEHEALTH OBSTACLES The first major problem is the variance in state laws in regard to coverage of telehealth services.71 The United States could solve this problem through the passage of federal laws requiring telehealth services be covered and reimbursed under private insu rance plans. Besides just coverage, these laws should also loosen restrictions on licensing requirements. State laws may eventually align, but passage of a federal law would ensure things move in the right direction. Medicaid and Medicare could begin le ading the way in this aspect. Licensing requirements are important to ensure that doctors are competent, but COVID -19 has shown that removing state specific licensing requirements can be effective.72 Typically, a practitioner providing telehealth service s to a patient in State A would require a license to practice in State A.73 However, due to COVID -19, most states are allowing practitioners from other states to practice in their state through telehealth services.74 This temporary waiver should be made permanent and incorporated into federal law. Those living in rural states would be able to take advantage of specialists that are not available in their state through telehealth services. Another important aspect of a future telehealth law would be paymen t parity. Payment parity exists when services provided through telehealth are reimbursed at the same rate as if the service was provided in person.75 Only a small minority of states required payment parity for telehealth services 71 Id. 72 Gabriela Weigel et al., Telemedicine in the U.S. During the COVID -19 Emergency and Beyond , KAISER FAM. FOUND 73 Id. 74 Id. 75 Id. 166 Advance Directive Vol. 30 before COVID -19.76 More states have begun to require telehealth payment parity during the COVID -19 public health emergency.77 Laws requiring payment parity for telehealth services encourages insurance providers to include these services in their plan.78 This, in turn, increase s access.79 In response to COVID -19, telehealth options covered by Medicare were expanded.80 Before this expansion, Medicare only paid for telehealth if certain requirements were met.81 One of these requirements was that the patient would have to receive the telehealth service at a clinic, hospital, or other type of medical facility.82 Now, temporarily due to COVID -19, Medicare is covering office, hospital, and other types of visits con ducted via telehealth, even if done from the patient's home.83 Any new legislation expanding telehealth should allow patients to receive telehealth services from their home. As discussed, travel times can be a major deterrent to receiving care for those in rural areas.84 Telehealth from home services eliminate all travel time. Similarly, under Medicaid states decide whether or not to cover telehealth services.85 \"The general requirements of comparability, statewideness , and freedom of choice do not appl y with regard to telemedicine services.\"86 In regard to pricing, private insurers tend to follow Medicare's lead.87 Medicare 76 Id. 77 Id. 78 Id. 79 Id. 80 Medicare Telemedicine Health Care Provider Fact Sheet , CTRS.

CONCLUSION Telehealth services are an increasingly important part of medical care, particularly during public health emergencies such as COVID -19. Telehealth services have a un ique opportunity to help bridge the gap in health disparities between rural and urban areas.89 Further, the expansion of telehealth services in the United States could increase medical access for everyone, not just those living in rural areas.90 However, it is important to acknowledge the disparate impact the lack of telehealth coverage has on those living in rural areas due to the sparsity of physicians and specialists in these regions.91 There are barriers to expanded telehealth coverage such as inconsistent state laws, but these barriers can be overcome.92 The best way to overcome the barrier of state laws is to pass federal legislation requiring the coverage of telehealth services by insurance providers. Any new law should all ow for the practice of telehealth across state lines to ensure that those in underserved areas are able to access the care they need. State by state licensing requirements for telehealth have temporarily went away in many states due to COVID -19 and it sho ws that such a change is feasible.93 Any new law should also address 88 See generally id . at 32 (\"Medic are could exert sway through multiple channels.

In April of 2020, the Third Circuit ruled on a case denying the inmate compassionate release because the thirty day period had not been met for the BOP to review, stating that \"it presents a glaring roadblock foreclosing compassionate release at this point .\"38 Conversely, that same month in an Iowa District Court, the court ruled that the inmate did not have to meet the exhaustion requirement in their appeal to be released early due to medical vulnerability, stating that the original party likely not looking at the application, the parties lacked an adversarial relationship.39 This conflict creates more confusio n, and courts have often discussed the impracticability of this rule during a public health 33 Id. 34 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a73582(c)(1)(A). 35 Id. 36 See Alder, supra note 17. 37 See LaVigne -Albert, supra note 17 38 United States v.

There is a wide variety within the elements of the programs in regard to reporting, eligibility, authority, and if it is an o ption at all.43 As many of these cases are either handled internally within the prison or are never reported if they do go to court, there is not a lot of public information available to review the differences pre and post COVID -19 on the volumes or appro vals of compassionate release.44 To respond in situations of public health crises, adjustments should be made to who has the authority to bring a compassionate release claim, and reporting should be encouraged to track progress. 40 United States v.

Even though New York's program is one of the most complex, these results are indicative of the outstanding hindrances in getting through these parole requests. PROPOSAL TO UPDATE LANGUAGE FOR BRINGING COMPASSIONATE RELEASE CLAIMS DURING A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY Many government agencies and systems have exceptions for public health emergencies, that either eliminate obstacles, or give flexibility to the managing bodies to create appr opriate policies that last solely for the duration of the declared emergency.57 This framework should be used to review compassionate release or medical parole for inmates when it comes to proactively avoiding contracting a disease or seeking treatment th at goes 53 Id. 54 See Price, supra note 9, at 19. 55 See id. 56 Parole and Early Release , OPPAGA, 18 (Nov. 2019), https://oppaga.fl.gov/Documents/ Reports/19 -13.pdf (discussing that 38 inmates were released during fiscal year 2018 -2019 while 288 died). 57 See generally Is the HIPAA Privacy Rule Suspended During a National or Public Health Emergency? , waiving rights of the secretary for privacy rules and regulations during a public health emergency). See also Coronavirus on regulation waivers during the Covid -19 pandemic across Medicaid, Medicare, and CHIP). 2020 Compassionate Release During a Pandemic 209 above and beyond the prison's current capabilities. Specifically, allowing for exceptions during a public health crisis would benefit early release programs and allow inmates to advocate on their own without waiting for administrative backlog. Under this framework inmates can directly bring claims, removing the need for the BOP and other prison faculty to review applications.58 Additionally, states should be required to involve medical personnel in the process early on. Involving medical personn el further improves efficiency and navigability of this process, as these professionals can more clearly identify eligible patients and provide documentation based on their regular interactions with their patients.59 Finally, there needs to be an expansion of education at both the federal and state level. On the federal side, these recommendations can be accommodated through an update to 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3582 to allow removal of the thirty -day time delay or expand the compelling reason criteria to inc lude public health exceptions and allow inmates to bring cases directly to the courts. Courts have stated that this analysis is a burden.60 This update would allow for an inmate to bring their case directly to the courts to review all factors that play a role in to their situation. This administrative efficiency is vital, especially when, as with COVID -19, viral spread is time -sensitive and removing vulnerable prisoners fast can reduce their exposure. 58 See Tom McParland, Former Cuomo Aide, Latest to Highlight BOP 'Confusion', Remains in Quarantine at NY Prison, LAW.COM Mitchell & Brie Williams, Compassionate Release Policy Ref orm: Physicians as Advocates for Human Dignity , AMA J OF ETHICS 854, 854-61 (2017), (discussing the benefits of evidence -based advocacy). 60 See United States v.

This is no longer the law. This leaves district courts in a conundrum.\"). 210 Advance Directive Vol. 30 The argument on the state side is much less clear du e to variety in current state laws and the opinions on the programs in general. However, there are common successes among more efficient and effective compassionate release programs. Efficiency gains should be implemented: direct advocacy from inmates, medical professional review and recommendation, and educational processes for inmates and their families. States should be encouraged to implement direct advocacy for compassionate rel ease, taking advantage of the added efficiency during a public health crisis as an exception.61 As many states have wardens, directors of corrections, or governors that either review the claim first or directly appeal to the courts, this would remove that burden when a public health emergency has taken place.62 This would lighten a heavy administrative load during an emergency, without sacrificing the health and well -being of a high -risk population. Looking to Illinois as an example of where a current pr ocess can be exacerbated by a public health crisis, as described earlier, the Governor is in charge of bringing claims.63 During the COVID -19 pandemic, the Governor was in charge of decisions including, but certainly not limited to: lockdown procedures fo r business, education decisions, and mask mandates.64 Adding on to this workload with an increasing number of compassionate release applications, makes it unlikely that the timely review needed is met. Allowing direct advocacy has the opportunity to spee d up the program substantially and reduce the number of deaths of waiting applicants.65 61 See H.R. REP. 115 -699 at 22 (discussing the need to lean on the effectiveness and efficiency of the court as the background be hind the First Step Act legislation). 62 See Post & Williams, supra note 12. 63 Ill.

Exec. Law \u00a7259 -s. 2020 Compassionate Release During a Pandemic 211 Involving medical personnel that provide recommendations and documentation for eligible inmates can further increase the efficiency of the process. This coordination should be integrated into standard medical care, especially as the expectation would be that prisoners would be under regular medical review during a public health crisis or normal operation. Incorporating advocacy of medical professionals has the added be nefit of providing education to inmates, however , no matter the involvement of medical professionals all compassionate release programs should update their training and educational materials. Without knowledge of the programs or access to learn about opti ons, no one is likely to bring the claim.66 This could be either targeted education for vulnerable populations or regular updates on the process to inmates and their families. Either way, education and awareness lend itself to better advocacy and more co mplete applications, ultimately benefitting the efficiency of the program. Finally, in order to measure the effectiveness of the program and make updates, there is also a need to have consistent reporting so that effective updates can be tracked and imple mented broadly. These updates allow for alignment with federal government goals on effective home confinement and compassionate release programs.67 This flexibility encourages appropriate release for those who are medically vulnerable, and the prison is unable to care for effectively. Both state and federal prisons have room to improve when it comes to compassionate release, and both can learn from the failures of the pandemic in regard to prison care. Allowing prisoners, or prisoners' families, to advo cate directly to the decision -making body for the institution creates a more streamlined 66 Price, supra note 9, at 21 (laying out specific recommendations on publicizing information on compassionate release). 67 See James, supra note 23 (discussing the goals of the First Step Act in reducing prison population and recidivism). 212 Advance Directive Vol. 30 process and reduces confusions and administrative burden. This is an efficiency gain across the system, but especially within a public health crisis when time is even more valuable. CONCLUSION In areas where home confinement or medical home confinement is available and appropriate, prisoners are limited in their ability to advocate for their early release, even when they have met eligibility requirements. Within a public health crisis, time is even more valuable for those inmates who are suffering from a terminal illness or are high risk for infection. Removing the administrative requirements that separate the inmate from direct advocation, at either a level within t he prison management or the court, and a higher level in light of delays, allows for quicker decisions when time is incredibly valuable in a public health emergency. Inmates should be allowed to advocate for themselves regarding compassionate release programs directly to the courts or decision maker to reduce these very costly time delays. 213 Price Gouging & Health Justice: Passing Anti -Price Gouging Laws amid a Pandemic Joseph Nguyen Ho The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (\"COVID -19\") pandemic creates numerous healthcare problems for consumers. One, in particular, is the price gouging of health care supplies which causes access issues for consumers. A solution to this price gouging problem is to enact federal and state anti -price gouging statutes to promote health justice. The federal government and the thirteen states with no anti -price gouging statutes should take legislative action to enact these protective statutes.1 Currently, thirty -seven states and the District of Columbia maintain anti -price gouging statutes.2 States that do not have anti -price gouging statutes rely on executive orders or other consumer protection laws.3 Similarly, while the federal government has relied on other federal acts and executive orders to prevent price gouging, there is no federal law aimed at prohibiting price gouging.4 Consequently, Congress has proposed bills, but to no avail.5 Notwithstanding, legislatures must enact anti -price gouging statutes. Indeed, this legislative action addressing price gouging will promote health justice amid a pandemic. First, this paper examines the background of price gouging, federal anti -price gouging laws, and perhaps the largest area of divergence in price gouging laws: state -by-state variation. Next, this paper shifts to discuss the effects of price gouging on the general economy 1 COVID -19 Survey of Federal and State Price Gouging Laws, KING SPALDING , https://www.kslaw.com/pa ges/covid -19-survey 2, 2020) [hereinafter Federal & State Price Gouging Survey ]. 2 Id. 3 Id. 4 Id. 5 Id. 214 Advance Directive Vol. 30 and antitrust law. Finally, the paper concludes with the posit that to promote health justice amid a pandemic, Congress and states wit h no anti -price gouging statutes must enact legislation. PRICE GOUGING Defining Price Gouging The Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") defines \"price gouging\" as a term that lacks a formal definition \u2014but typically refers to a significant and rapid price increase after a demand.6 Often, price gouging is a situation where a retailer or a supplier takes advantage of increases in demand by \"charging exorbitant prices for necessities after a natural disaster or other state emergency. \"7 State Anti -Price Gouging Laws An illustrative example of the difficulty of determining whether this increase in price is excessive or based on meeting market demands is People ex rel. Spitzer v. Wever Petroleum .8 The New York Superior Court, or New York's appellate court , noted that the price increase was unconscionably excessive because the defendant's (Wever) price increase \"far exceeded the needed increase for Wever to maintain a similar pre -hurricane profit or to generate the required revenue to purchase gasoline from ExxonMobile the 6 U.S. DEP'T.

Finally, other states rely on executive orders dur ing state trigged emergencies such as Delaware, Minnesota, Arizona (although Arizona's AG has stated it does not have the authority under its existing consumer protection laws to prosecute COVID -19 price gouging).

This issue also illustrates the need to shift from patchwork protections to uniform law during the onset and amid the pandemic's length. For example, Tennessee invoked its price gouging statute on March 12, 2020 by executive order, protecting emergency and medical supplies.57 New York broadened its price gouging laws by amen ding its statute, Section 396 -r, to include \"essential goods or services\" such as \"essential medical supplies and services.\"58 In contrast, states like Arizona and Minnesota relied on executive orders, and states like South and North Dakota essentially to ok no action.59 The differences in state law depict the need for clarity in state anti - price gouging laws as the failure of clarity makes complying ostensible.60 56 Neil Vigdor, Tennessee Brothers Who Hoarded Hand Sanitizer Settle to Avoid Price - Gouging Fine, N.Y.

First, to sustain goods and services for consumers, legislatures must clarify what triggers a price gouging statute and the length of price gouging protections during an emergency. An example of the unc lear framework is the length of Kentucky's price gouging laws.61 While, Commentators stated that Kentucky' price gouging law expired on April 21, 2020, the Governor has stated that he will continue to extend the price gouging law through the duration of t he state's emergency.62 As of September 28, 2020, the Governor signed Executive Order 2020 -822 prohibiting price gouging and extending previous orders for the emergencies duration and time.63 This analysis does not intend to address the legality of the e xtensions or conclude that emergency orders should not trigger price gouging protections. Instead, this paper argues that regardless of whether emergency orders trigger statutory protections, there needs to be clarity to protect suppliers, providers, and consumers. For example, fourteen states have undefined price gouging end dates; ten states' price gouging's end date is \"not applicable;\" and the remaining states' and the District of Columbia's end dates vary dramatically.64 Thus, enacted statutes that outline the length or procedures to address price gouging are crucial amid a pandemic. first there is a disruption in competition. Second, there is a disruption in companies' standard operations. Third, companies fear lawsuits). 61 See Ondeck et . al, When Will it End \u2014 Price Gouging Restrictions Remain in Place for Uncertain Period , NAT'L. L. REV.

As mentioned, California's enforcement triggers after a ten percent increase in prices, while other states prohibit all price increases or \"excessive\" price incre ases.65 Furthermore, some states' anti - price gouging laws apply to \"supply chain businesses,\" some only cover necessary materials, while others cover normal goods and services.66 Commentators suggest that this patchwork discourages innovation and competition, disrupts businesses' standard operations, and promotes class action.67 Unfortunately, these do not directly address the effect on health justice. States that model their prospective price gouging laws after states with these laws should be a ware that failure to clarify price gouging terms could directly and negatively affect consumers' health. In other words, enacting legislation to reframe the message in the lens of health justice will promote a positive message and commitment to ethical ch ange. Third, while it is imperative states enact anti -price gouging statutes, it is a priority that these prospective statutes cover health necessities. For example, New York amended its price gouging statutes as a response to COVID -19.68 While Califo rnia's enacted price gouging statute, CAL. PENAL CODE \u00a7 396(b), applied to a wide range of products such as food items or goods, emergency supplies, and medical supplies, among others.69 In contrast, an example of patchwork coverage is in Indiana, where i ts price gouging statute focuses on fuel prices, but the state has otherwise relied on executive orders.70 Here, patchwork coverage is evident when comparing each state, and it is 65 Limits on Price Increases , supra note 15. 66 Ondeck & Tarr, supra note 60. 67 Id. 68 Vanunu, supra note 58. 69 See Federal & State Price Gouging Survey , supra note 1 (explaining California's price gouging laws). 70 See id (explaining Indiana's price gouging laws). 2020 Price Gouging and Health Justice 225 clear from these states' variations that the scope of coverage is noncompre hensive.71 Therefore, explicitly codifying price protection of goods and other medical supplies in response to the pandemic and even in a post-pandemic environment to avoid price gouging situations seen in epinephrine pens is necessary to ensure equitable access as a matter of health justice.72 Finally, it is worthy to note that the Kentucky Attorney General brought a federal action to enforce the state's price gouging statute against Amazon suppliers.73 The federal court held that Kentucky's price gougi ng statutes is not allowed to regulate prices charged outside of Kentucky due to Amazon's nationwide operation.74 Accordingly, it reasoned that suppliers have limited control over prices and the difficulty complying with differing state price gouging laws .75 This litigation aptly depicts state difficulty navigating and enforcing price gouging, and the need for a federal price gouging statute. This argument is bolstered by the views expressed by Professor Waller, \"when the law in action does not match the law on the books, something has to give.\"76 71 See id (examining all fifty states, the federal government, and the District of Columbia's anti-price gouging laws.) . 72 See Wolf Richter, EpiPen is Getting Crushed by a $10 Copycat, BUS.

Therefore, the federal and state government must view price gouging, antitrust laws, and the economy through a health justice l ens for the betterment of society. 77 Kendra L. Berardi & Ian T.

THE INSECURE POSITION OF PATIENTS OF LOW SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS Patient safety is defined by the National Academ y of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine or IOM) as \"the prevention of harm to patients.\"6 Patient safety has been a point of scrutiny ever since the National Academy of Medicine released the landmark paper \"To Err is Human\" in 1999.7 It is a national concern, with an estimated 98,000 to 440,000 people dying annually from preventable errors in hospital.8 However, many roadblocks to progress persist, some of which originate in the culture of medical organizations.9 Patient safety is of particular concern to people of lower socioeconomic status.

This must be done by prioritizing transparency and disclosure, as well as engaging with patients directly. Improving health justice require s equity, which means minimizing the disparity in health and life expectancy between those of lower and higher status.13 LAWSUITS VERSUS ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION Medical malpractice suits have long been used to hold physicians liable, but these suit s are the wrong means to achieving this end for many reasons.14 Such suits have been found to be \"a profoundly inaccurate mechanism for distributing compensation\" as well as \"tremendously inefficient.\"15 The majority of bad outcomes are the result of acc idents, with physicians showing genuine remorse.16 Though tort suits are designed to make the victim whole 10 Socioeconomic Status , APA , www.apa.org/topics/socioeconomic -status (last visited Nov. 30, 2020). 11 Nancy E.

Malpractice suits are expensive, directly costing healthcare providers in 2009 alone approximately $35 billion, or 2% of total healthcare expenditures across the United States that year.29 A majority of states have implemented caps on noneconomic damages in medical malpractice suits to minimize this economic risk.30 Even with these caps, the noneconomic damages caps sti ll typically start at $250,000, while total caps may be well over $1 million.31 And even then, these caps can be subverted through patients pursuing higher economic damages, which are not capped.32 26 Id. 27 Id. 28 Id. 29 National Medical Malpractice Statistics , NOLO, www.medicalmalpractice.com/ lander/national -medical -malpractice -facts USL EGAL , https://definitions.uslegal.com/n/non 2020) (\"Non -economic damages are compensations claimed against intangi ble harms such as severe pain, physical and emotional distress and disfigurement, loss of the enjoyment of life for an injury has caused, including sterility, loss of sexual organs, physical impairment.

This alternative to lawsuits in resolving conflicts \"refers to techniques used to resolve conflicts without going to the courtroom.\"58 In other words, ADR is simply an alternative method to dispute resolution which avoids medical malpractice suits. ADR may take a variety of forms, which \"can be thought of as a spectrum from informal to formal.\"59 On the informal end of the spectrum is ba sic negotiation, where parties meet to discuss and resolve the conflict.60 More formal proceedings are also available, including mediation, in which \"a negotiation is facilitated by a neutral third -party mediator;\"61 arbitration, where parties are represented by attorneys before an arbiter or arbitration panel who issues binding decisions;62 and pretrial screenings, \"informal screenings before litigation by a neutral party to assess the relative strengths of each part y's case and determine whether the trial merits going to trial.\"63 These solutions do not rely on the courts, and are often quicker, simpler, cheaper, more flexible, and more effective than traditional suits.64 ADR must play a bigger role in healthcare in order for the medical industry to better protect itself from liability, prevent more mistakes, and provide equity to patients. Medical malpractice is an important last resort, as discussed in detail later, but it is overused in its current form.65 One m ight 58 Sohn, supra note 4, at 1370. 59 Id. at 1371. 60 Id. 61 Id. at 1372. 62 Id. at 1373. 63 Id. at 1374. 64 Id. at 1372. 65 Studdert, supra note 3. 236 Advance Directive Vol. 30 reasonably think that healthcare organizations would seek to avoid medical malpractice and other tort suits whenever possible, as healthcare organizations seem to dislike dealing with the fallout of adverse events, but this practice so far has led to such issues being hidden rather than addressed.66 While it is understandable that healthcare organizations wish to avoid confronting problems, this behavior is irresponsible and does not guarantee that the malpractice suits will go away. In fact, studies have demonstrated that no significant increase in the risk of suits occurs due to full and transparent disclosure of errors.67 A study at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio was conducted to examine the effects of presenting trau ma patient cases at a Weekly Morbidity and Mortality (M&M) conference.68 M&M conferences are venues, open to all healthcare providers, that serve to discuss deaths, selected major complications, and adverse events.69 Such conferences exist to foster a mo re transparent culture related to adverse events.70 The study found that the rate of patients suing in total (4.25 per 100,000 patients/year), only those included in the M&M presentation (29.6 per 100,000 patients/year) and those who suffered complication s (14 per 100,000 patients/year) had no statistical differences between them.71 There was at worst no negative impact resulting from the presentation of cases.72 The medical industry has no excuse to hide its errors. It would thus benefit all parties if the healthcare providers were to face its 66 Schlachter, supra note 9, (\"The culture of medicine frowns on admitting mistakes, usually on the pretense of fear of malpractice lawsuits. But what's really at risk are doctors' egos and the preservation of a system that lets physicians avoid accountability by ignoring problems or shifting blame to 'the system ' or any culprit other tha n themselves.\"). 67 Stewart, supra note 40, at 647. 68 Id. at 645. 69 Id. at 646. 70 Id. 71 Id. at 647. 72 Id. 2020 ADR for Health Justice 237 problems head on and provide venues outside the courtroom for issues to be resolved. CURBING MEDICAL MALPRACTICE IN FAVOR OF ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION WILL ESPECIALLY BENEFIT THOSE OF LOW SOCIOECONOMIC STATU S Among other benefits, ADR can reframe errors as learning opportunities rather than mistakes to be hidden. Most errors are the result of systemic problems, including fatigue, improper labeling of equipment, communication breakdowns, and staffing issues.73 Medical malpractice suits may punish healthcare providers such for reasonable errors or errors beyond their control. This is a detrimental precedent, as it leads to aforementioned negative results, like defensive medicine and minimal transparency, whi ch ignores many root causes of errors.74 Undue punishment is not the way the medical field should proceed if it wishes to provide a safer environment for its patients. At best, it is blaming physicians for being human and making mistakes, at worst, it is blaming employees for systemic problems beyond their control, such as excessive work hours or communication failures due to shift changes.75 If a safer patient environment is the goal, ADR must play a greater role relative to medical malpractice suits. If institutions protect their employees and settle with patients in the event of medical errors, it will encourage more physicians, nurses, and others to speak out in the event of medical errors. There is significant evidence that physicians feel a wide range of negative emotions after discovering they 73 Michael A. E. Ramsay, Physician Fatigue , 13 BAYLOR U. MED. CEN. PRO. 148 , 148 (2000) (\"The incidence of human error is increased by fatigue, sleep deprivation, and stress (2). As performance decreases, errors of omission occur with increasing frequency.\") . 74 Sekhar, supra note 1006. 75 Ramsay, supra note 73, at 148 (\"However, as performance further deterior ates errors of commission occur: these are 'mistakes ' where the planning process itself is flawed.\"). 238 Advance Directive Vol. 30 committed a medical error.76 Some physicians worry that they would make unwise decisions if i t meant relieving themselves of the emotional burden.77 Creating an environment more accepting of errors would also make it more likely that physicians reveal errors that were caused by more personal failings. Medical malpractice suits are especially hard on the disadvantaged and poor because such suits are expensive and slow to provide financial compensation, if any.78 People of low socioeconomic status, by definition, have limited financial resources and less wealth to get through traumatic events.79 They are also less likely to have insurance.80 These individuals need compensation immediately after the error in question to account for future medical bills and lost income. Because ADR can provide patients and their families with immediate access to se ttlement funds, it is the best course of action for individuals who need reimbursement faster than medical malpractice lawsuits can facilitate.81 Medical malpractice suits, as they currently exist, are already an incentive to come to the negotiating tabl e. Only seven percent of medical malpractice suits make it to trial, with the remainder settled out of court.82 The suits that do make it to trial are not typically won by plaintiffs, with only twenty -one percent of the cases tried ruling in their favor.83 Thus, it is the settlement resulting from filing the suit, rather than the suit itself, that most frequently 76 Gallagher, supra note 16, at 1005. 77 Id. 78 Studdert, supra note 3. 79 APA, supra note 10. 80 Becker, supra note 5. 81 John S.

Rev. 23, 31 (2001) (\"[I]t was readily apparent that ADR had resolved the dispute much faster and at less expense than the conventional process would have, based on the typical duration and cost of the latter in similar circumstances.\"). 82 National Medical Malpractice Statistics, supra note 29, at 1. 83 Id. 2020 ADR for Health Justice 239 compensates victims. Because out -of-court settlements provide compensation, healthcare providers appear to be in a prime position to offer or expand upon systems for compensating patients that are cheaper, more convenient, and less confrontational for both the patients and the providers. This argument for ADR does not suggest that medical malpractice should be discarded. It is important that medical institutions be held liable. Medical malpractice suits rarely make it to trial anyway.84 Ideally, tort litigation should remain an option, but the focus and efforts of healthcare providers should be shifted to ADR. Increasing the u se of ADR will not be easy for a variety of reasons. Though physicians generally voice approval for disclosure, many fear that disclosing errors could undermine patient trust.85 However, studies have shown that increased transparency does not increase th e risk of litigation, but instead increases trust and communication with patients.86 As discussed, malpractice suits are painful for the patients as well, thus, alternatives should be pursued whenever possible for the benefit of both potential plaintiffs and defendants. Providing ADR to patients will likely reduce the risk of medical malpractice suits being filed against healthcare providers, due to the availability of other remedies and increased trust and transparency.87 A 84 National Medical Malpractice Statistics, supra note 29, at 1. 85 Gallagher, supra note 16, at 1003 -04. 86 Stewart, supra note 40, at 648 (\"In matters of disclosure and reporti ng, transparency is a key initiative of the patient safety movement. To correct errors, one must be free to discuss them frankly and openly with all care providers in the system. Our data, in this and a previous study, lend direct support to the notion tha t internal transparency with respect to discussion of errors does not lead to increased risk of lawsuit.\"). 87 See Stewart, supra note 40, at 647 (inc reasing transparency did not increase risk of litigation). 240 Advance Directive Vol. 30 decreased risk of malpractice suits will likely make physicians less paranoid and ensure a positive feedback loop of increased trust and transparency.88 The implementation of ADR should be provider -driven. A system should be implemented that provides quick compensation rather than s purring injured parties to take unnecessary legal action. Healthcare organizations providing their own solutions for their mistakes may go a considerable way in improving transparency and building trust with patients. The amount of compensation is likely to be controversial, as seen with the amount of current legislation on tort damage caps.89 For some, this might be preferable to no initial payment. For others, this is where medical malpractice suits could step in. As discussed, in this system, medica l malpractice suits would not be replaced but would instead play a more limited role in keeping privately provided remedies accountable. CONCLUSION ADR must play a bigger role in healthcare in order for the medical industry to better protect itself from li ability, prevent more mistakes, and provide equity to patients. ADR would benefit patients of low socioeconomic status who suffer from medical errors and are seeking compensation. This is because it provides quicker access to settlement funds, is less em otionally taxing on healthcare providers and patients alike, improves patient safety, and increases trust. Many patients of low socioeconomic status are already distrustful of the healthcare system. A lack of transparency and lacking channels of communic ation will not help this fact. Medical malpractice suits have not adequately reduced medical errors, in part because a lack of 88 Gallagher, supra note 16, at 1004 (\"Many physicians said that a fear of litigation limited what they tell patients about errors.\"). 89 National Medical Malpractice Statistics, supra note 29, at 1. 2020 ADR for Health Justice 241 disclosure makes it easier for healthcare providers to simply ignore errors rather than rectify them. To adequately reduce medi cal errors, punishment of healthcare providers must be replaced with reflection and education. Further, opacity by healthcare providers in why and how medical errors occur, which is motivated by fear of medical malpractice lawsuits, must be replaced with transparency. And while ADR is a better form of dispute resolution, the medical malpractice lawsuit is still an important tool, and simply must be used in concert with less punishing alternatives. Finally, in order to further health justice, ADR must be more often utilized to provide better compensation and communication with patients of lower socioeconomic status. 243 OSHA & Addressing the Disparate Impact of COVID - 19 Within Vulnerable Communities Liam Kenney INTRODUCTION The last few decades have showcased drastic leaps toward a cohesive global community not only through relations between states in economics and technology, but also in healthcare policy.1 In a world of increasing human connection and unprecedented access to global travel, a worldwide pandemic presents one of the most serious public health concerns .2 Countries around the world have struggled to provide an appropriate response to the curren t coronavirus pandemic with both stories of inspirational success and utter failure.3 The discrepancy between responses is likely due to the complexity of the pandemic, which includes a dizzying array of geographical and societal factors that can impact the spread and effect of a global virus.4 Countries must work together in order to properly coordinate an international response while ensuring adequate measures are taken within their own borders. The potential for the rapid and widespread transmission of similar viruses in the future necessitates an updated federal baseline in the United 1 See Dominique Vervoort et al. , COVID -19 Pandemic: A Time for Collaboration and a Unified Global Health Front , INT'L J.

First, the article will discuss how the current U.S. response to the pandemic is organized in the context of workplace safety and what OSHA's role has been thus far. Second, the article will discuss how federal intervention through OSHA could benefit the most at-risk communities. Finally, the feasibility of implementing OSHA regulations which address infectious diseases will be explored. In order to advocate for changes that benefit vulnerable communities, it is critical to first understand what is included i n the definition of the term vulnerable. The term \"vulnerable\" refers to communities that suffer from six health and social indicators as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (\"CDC\") social vulnerability index and specific COVID -19 vulnerability factors.13 These indicators include socioeconomic status, household composition and disability, minority status and language, housing type and transportation, epidemiologic factors, and healthcare system factors.14 Utilization of this data allows for a more refined definition of what constitutes a vulnerable community and how certain factors rank in 11 Bruce Rolfsen, States, Localities Filling F ederal Void with Virus Safety Rules, BLOOMBERG L., (Aug. 7, 2020), https://news.bloomberglaw.com/safety/states -localities - filling -federal -void-with-virus -safety -rules. 12 Id. 13 The COVID -19 Community Vulnerability Index, supra note 9. 14 Id. 246 Advance Directive Vol. 30 accounting for such vulnerability.15 The combination of these indicators suggests the level at which a specific commun ity is equipped to deal with a widespread health concern such as a pandemic.16 Although the current pandemic has yet to subside in the United States, there are prominent trends emerging as to what factors are the most important in determining risk factors for vulnerability.17 Socioeconomic and minority status is heavily correlated with the level of overall community vulnerability \u2014that is, these factors are tied with increased vulnerability to a pandemic such as COVID -19.18 This disparity in vulnerability becomes more concerning when combined with data which clearly indicates that, throughout all stages of the pandemic, minorities are going into work at a higher rate than non -minorities.19 With no sign that the coronavirus will subside any time soon in th e United States,20 a solution for implementing a uniform policy could be to establish a federal policy that can protect the country's most vulnerable populations.21 PANDEMIC RESPONSE ORGANIZATION AND OSHA' S ROLE The United States federal pandemic response is organized in a top -down manner with a variety of agencies assigned to different tasks.22 In general, 15 Id. 16 Id. 17 Id. 18 Id. 19 Catherine Thorbecke, 'Heroes or Hostages?': Communities of Color Bear the Burden of Essential Work in Coronavirus Crisis, ABC NEWS, https://abcnews.go.com/Business/heroes - hostages -communities -color -bear-burden -essential -work/story?id=70662472 (last 18, 2020). 20 COVID -19 Forecasts: Cases, CTRS.

However, OSHA has only published guidelines for workplaces concerning COVID -19 that do not hold any man datory legal or regulatory power.28 The absence of such concrete federal standards has negative consequences for essential workers who must physically report to work (many of whom are minorities).29 Minority populations make up the bulk of essential work er demographics in places such as New York City where seventy -five percent of all essential workers are people of color.30 This causes a disparate impact 23 Id. 24 Id. 25 About OSHA , U.S. DEPT.

As of October 2020, OSHA has received over 9,000 complaints directl y related to Covid - 19, yet has only given out about eighty -five citations to employers.33 This failure to protect the health of workers during a global pandemic is the absolute antithesis of OSHA's mission.34 In 2019, OSHA issued 28,934 citations in tota l, offering a much higher level of enforcement.35 There does not appear to be a stated reason for the lack of enforcement during the current pandemic, putting vulnerable essential workers at risk.36 In the end, the failure to protect workers during the pa ndemic affects virtually everyone and has a significant disparate impact on vulnerable communities.

OSHA is responsible for prescribing remedies to the overwhelming amount of workplace complaints related to COVID -19 and should possess the power to remedy such complaints in a way that is best suited to the occupatio nal hazards presented by the current pandemic.38 Although the CDC excels in its role of providing general guidance and performing activities such as contact tracing and identification of hotspots, its scope is too broad and its resources too stretched to provide the support that employees need in their places of work.39 OSHA has the specialized knowledge and experience required to create safer workplace conditions, thus, OSHA should enact and enforce standards that protect workers during a public health c rises, such as the current pandemic.40 THE BENEFITS OF FEDERAL INTERVENTION THROUGH OSHA There are a number of positive effects that would result from workplace regulations created and enforced by OSHA.41 A federal workplace standard would allow for cla rity and consistency for both workers and employers.42 Bloomberg Law, which has tracked state and local coronavirus -related regulations, reports that there are currently 439 such workplace regulations 37 OSHA Act of 1970, Pub.

With a concrete federal standard, employe rs would know what rules they must follow and workers would know what to expect when it comes to workplace safety and their health.44 Employers would not have to worry about violating grey areas of ever -changing orders and guidance from state and local of ficials.45 Along with this, workers would know what to expect for workplace safety and would gain peace of mind that their health is not dependent on the whims of their employer.46 Another benefit of an established federal standard is the enforcement aspect of OSHA.47 Businesses that do not take employee safety serious in general would have to face the potential of government penalties for failure to comply with workplace safety regulations.48 Put simply, the cost of violations for non -compliance in gen eral have risen exponentially and the cost to comply with regulations are now significantly less than penalties for violating relevant standards.49 Such enforcement action in the form of fines for unsafe conditions would be crucial for protecting our most vulnerable communities.50 A recent report by the Economic Policy Institute found that nearly seventy percent of current Hispanic and Black onsite employees feel that they face considerable risks of exposure to the coronavirus.51 The report concluded that the most vulnerable workers with the least bargaining power (including Black, Hispanic, and low to middle -class employees) are not currently protected by established standards.52 These employees fear for 43 Id. 44 Id. 45 Id. 46 Dorman & Mishel, supra note 10.

and improved working conditions.53 Many of these individuals from vulnerable communities are forced to continue working throug hout the pandemic as they rely heavily on their positions in order to provide for themselves and their families.54 Roughly half of essential workers believe that there is a moderate to large risk of contracting the coronavirus from doing their job.55 Furthermore, nearly forty percent of employees have raised concerns directly with their employer over a lack of protection from COVID -19.56 These concerns demonstrate a lack of faith in employers to properly implement safety measures and shows that the count ry's essential workers worry about their health at work.57 By establishing standards, OSHA can help to calm the fears of health hazards and exposure to the virus by providing safer workplaces for those who need it most.58 This can be accomplished by simp ly converting the current OSHA guidelines into proper regulations with the power of legal enforcement and penalties for employers who fail to comply.59 FEASIBILITY OF AN OSHA WORKPLACE PANDEMIC STANDARD Although addressing the disparity of the effects of t he current pandemic within vulnerable communities may be possible through policy -making and intervention by OSHA, there are concerns with the feasibility of such a solution.60 The courts have been of little help in relieving the

regulations concerning the pandemic.63 The Court held that the agency is free to determine its own standards.64 While this may be a sound legal decision as courts often grant great deference to federal agencies, it closes an avenue for compelling the agency to act in a time of crisis and perform the way it was intended to protect the most vulnerable members of o ur society.65 Congress has also failed to offer relief for both businesses and employees.66 The second proposed stimulus package of 2020 includes language which requires OSHA to create and enforce an emergency standard that includes safety measures concer ning the coronavirus.67 However, the Senate has failed to vote on the package due to a move led by Senator Mitch McConnell and other members of the Senate to hold out on implementing legal protections for employers that might be sued for not providing safe workplaces.68 While such a move is aimed at protecting business owners, it may further delay the protections necessary for the health and safety of workers around the country. 61 Id. 62 Harper Neidig , Appeals Court Rejects AFL -CIO Lawsuit Over Lack of COVID -19 Labor Protections , HILL (June 11, appeals

OSHA has performed roughly 5,000 fewer inspections per year on average than it had during the last two presidential administrations and nearly half of the agencies leadership positions have yet to be filled by the Trump administration.70 A lack of necessary leadership, employees, and inspections greatly cripples the power of the agency to per form its oversight and enforcement duties.71 The current pandemic demonstrates that this lack of power is unacceptable and severely harms our most vulnerable who must report to work through times of public health crises.72 While such feasibility issues m ay seem daunting, they are not impossible to overcome. Although a potential avenue through the court system has been denied, Congress can pass the currently debated bill with language compelling OSHA to act and the administration may increase the capabili ties of the agency back to its more powerful stature by increasing funding and appointing agency leaders.73 Although this may have to wait until 2021 as the administration nears its end. If Senators can come to an agreement on a balance between protecting workers and the businesses that employ them, OSHA may obtain the power necessary to enact and enforce prop er levels of workplace safety.74 With economic pressures and uncertainty surrounding COVID -19 rising, this 69 Id. 70 Id. 71 Id. 72 Dorman & Mishel, supra note 10 (discussing the fe ars and expectations that employees have surrounding COVID -19 and their workplace). 73 The Editorial Board , supra note 8 (discussing a lack of necessary inspectors and issues within Congress). 74 Id. 254 Advance Directive Vol. 30 may be a likely scenario in the near future as calls for aid continue to increase.75 CONCLUSION As discussed, there are a variety of issues affecti ng the potency of OSHA's actions in its current state. However, the members of our most vulnerable communities are desperate for relief, especially those forced to work throughout the current crisis in order to provide for their families.

Lastly, this paper will address what legal measures can be undertaken to overcome these challenges. Specifically, telehealth policies should require providers to use more accessible and personalized platforms and should incorporate mandatory physi cian trainings to address the needs of underserved populations. BACKGROUND Chronic diseases like asthma, diabetes, and obstructive pulmonary disease commonly occur in urban environments.7 Low-income populations are the among the most vulnerable to these diseases.8 Unlike infectious disease controls or urgent care, chronic disease control requires long -term patient - clinician communication to achieve patients' adherence and behavior changes.9 With the rapid increase of patients with chronic diseases, telehealth intervention is useful in stimulating patients' self -management.10 Effective preventive management through telehealth alleviates the challenges for people with little access to in person appointments by integrating virtual and in -person care involving health workers from different social branches.11 An illustration of effective use of telehealth to improve patients' self - management can be found in a study from 2011 (Carter et al.).12 A treatment 7 Emily J.

On the one hand, implementing self - management requires complex and difficult routines, and cannot be achieved without close monitoring from care providers.21 On the other hand, obstacles including time and competing priorities pose a big challenge for telehealth.22 Patients have found it difficult to address their own concerns and reported that the distance made providers less attentive.23 Some believed they had less control of the conversation because the doctor rushed through the visit due to time pressure, others felt unheard and neglected due to lack of eye contact from their providers.24 Older, lower -income individuals in urban areas have also expressed strong preference to see their caregiver in person instead of utilizing telehealth.25 This is most likely due to the importance of personal relationships between these individuals and the ir care providers as well as the hesitation regarding quality and reliability of exams performed through virtual appointments.26 Such concerns pose potential barriers to the wider adoption of telehealth for chronic -disease management among low -income popu lations in urban areas.

To successfully implement such patient - centered platform among urban low -income communities, it is important for telehealth regulations to incorporate mandatory measures to ensure each individual's access to telehealth technologies, customize their use o f technology, give them direct control to the collected data, and improve the communication between patients and providers. Encourage the Use of Telemedicine Among Patients In order to encourage telemedicine acceptance by low -income patients and address their above -mentioned concerns, a number of steps need to be taken. A first and necessary step would be to create incentives among the patients to use telehealth by informing them about the medical qualifications of the specialists and the level of diagnostic accuracy using telemedicine.29 State medical regulatory boards must incorporate special requirements in clinic telemedicine policies and procedures to address the needs of low -income patients. These requirements should include developing educational materials to address misinformation and gaps in knowledge among older 27 Birthe Dinese n et al., Personalized Telehealth in the Future: A Global Research Agenda , 42 J.

For low -income in dividuals living in urban areas who may not have access to personal devices or technology, telehealth regulations may require local governments to use a certain percentage of funding to loan mobile devices and provide internet hotspots for them to enable a ccess.32 Governments or insurers could also reimburse community -based health programs to provide them with communication services to maintain their outpatient care.33 Alternatively, a telehealth wellness kiosk system could be implemented in a community setting for routine health monitoring, with staff on site to assist with device utilization.34 Each user can get a personal card they insert to access personal health information whenever they use the kiosk.35 For older individuals among these communities, regulatory guidelines should encourage the design of flexible computer interfaces and smooth navigations to ensure their consistent use of the system.36 In addition, the federal government recently finalized a rule allowing Medicare to cover telemedicine, incentivizing more physicians and patients 30 Id. 31 Qian Liu et al., Securing Telehealth Applications in a Web -Based e -Health Portal , 10 IEEE 3 -7 (2008). 32 June-Ho Kim et al., How the Rapid Shift to Telehealth Leaves Many Community Health Centers Behind During The COVID -19 Pandemic , HEALTH AFF.

Regulatory enforcement also needs to focus on the collaboration of communities of experts who develop the systems and those who work closely with the urban low -income populations.54 Successful engagement of data collection and information review require patient - generated data become actionable information and be inte grated into clinical 50 Chris Salisbury et al., Telehealth in Chronic Disease: Mixed-Methods Study to Develop the TECH Conceptual Model for Intervention Design and Evaluation , 5 BMJ OPEN 1, 7 (2014). 51 Id. 52 Dinesen et al., supra note 27, at 7. 53 Susan S.

Although the current telehealth system is not yet patient - centric enough to provide personalized treatment and engagement, there is promise o f a more inclusive future by utilizing the current policy framework. An opportunity for further research could include addressing the cost -benefit analyses and the reimbursement policies of telehealth adoption. 71 Telehealth Treatment Engagement with Latinx Populations During the COVID -19 Pandemic, LANCET (Oct 8, 2020), https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2215 - 0366%2820%2930419 -3. 72 Id. 73 Id. 267 Reasonable Accommodations for Parental Caregivers Hani Majeed INTRODUCTION The COVID -19 pandemic has highlighted the need for employers to provide reasonable accommodations for parents and guardians of young children with bona -fide childcare needs.1 Since COVID -19 is highly contagious, its outbreak has led to an overnight closure of our society.2 Overnight, millions of parents found themselves working remotely from their homes as their employers closed their physical workplaces.3 Upon recommendations from Center for Disease Control (CDC) and government orders, daycares and schools ceased in -person instruction.4 Domestic workers and nannies accordingly became cautious about leav ing their homes.5 Conversely, \"essential worker\" parents which constitute about forty percent of working Americans, were still required to go into work despite their children's schools and daycares being closed.6 This hodgepodge situation created a bona -fide childcare dilemma for most American parents of young children, particularly those between the ages of birth to five.7 Whether working remotely or going into work, parents and guardians of young children be came physically or mentally limited because of their bona - 1 David E.

Next, it explains why current legislation does not offer e nough protection. Finally, the article recommends a policy requiring employers to provide reasonable accommodation for bona -fide childcare needs. This policy should be modeled after American Disabilities Association (ADA), while borrowing concepts from t he Canadian Human Rights Commission, to ensure equity for mothers. Throughout this article, the term \"parents\" encompasses both parents and guardians, and the term \"mother\" refers to the maternal figure in a heterosexual relationship. MOTHERHOOD PENALTY The \"motherhood penalty\" is a phrase coined by sociologists to describe persistent gender disparities that working mothers encounter in the workplace.20 It is the phenomenon by which women's pay and opportunities decrease once they become mothers.21 This pandemic has exacerbated the 17 Khazan & Harris , supra note 6. 18 Lobell, supra note 9. 19 Caitlin Collins, et al., COVID -19 and the Gender Gap in Work Hours , GENDER WORK ORG., July 2020, at 11 -12 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/gwao.12506. 20 Mulvaney, supra note 12. 21 The Motherhood Penalty AAUW , https://www.aauw.org/issues/equity/motherhood/ (last visited Nov 15, 2020) . 270 Advance Directive Vol. 30 motherhood penalty.22 Furthermore, it has induced discrimination in hiring, firing, pay, and promotions.23 Unless employers offer flexible working condition for both parents, there is a risk that the motherhood penalty w ill drastically increase in the coming months and years.24 Mothers, when compared to fathers, continue to burden a larger share of caregiving obligations for young children during this pandemic.25 Professor Caitlyn Collins, co -author of a study by Washing ton University in St. Louis, suggests, \"Even among households in which both parents are able to work from home and are directly exposed to childcare and housework demands, mothers are scaling back to meet these responsibilities to a greater extent that fathers.\"26 Although the reason for this is unclear, data indicates that since the beginning of the pandemic, on an average, mothers have scaled back their work hours by about five percent or two hours per week, whereas fathers' work hours have essentially stayed the same.27 This also creates a long -term problem for mothers as employers look for ways to save money, and are more likely to lay off or discriminate against those who have already weakened their labor market attachment by scaling back their hours.28 The C enter for Work Life Law at the University of California's Hastings College of the Law notes that they have received over one thousand calls in the past six months by parents, pregnant employees and other caregivers who need assistance with mistreatment at work or issues 22 Collins, supra note 19. 23 Mulvaney, supra note 12.

As Professor Collins notes, \"By easing work demands and allowing flexibility where possible in the coming months, employers can prevent long -term losses in women's labor force participation.\"33 However, at this time, there is no duty upon employers to offer this flexibility.34 The remaining of this article argues that such a duty would fill the gaps in the statutory framework, and could protect parental caregivers, who are mostly mothers, from leaving the workforce entirely. CURRENT LAW AND ITS INSUFFICIENCY There is no duty o n American employers to provide accommodations to their employees for ordinary, non -healthcare, caregiving needs.35 Except for the temporary FFCRA, there is no explicit federal law that protects parental caregivers from discrimination.36 However, parents often bring in parental caregiver discrimination lawsuits under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.37 29 Yaffe -Bellany, supra note 2312, at 23. 30 Id. 31 Id. 32 Id. 33 Savat, supra note 24. 34 Debbie Kaminer, The Work -Family Conflict: Developing a Model of Parental Accommodations in the Workplace , 54 AM.

Meredi th Corp., the plaintiff alleged that she was discriminated by her employer for being a \"woman with a child\", but the court disagreed and thought a better characterization was \"a woman with childcare difficulties.\"51 The court held that she would not qualify under a Title VII claim because whereas a \"woman cannot be discriminated against for having a child,\" she can be denied shorter hours because of her childcare needs.52 The employer has no duty to accommodate.53 Similarly, in another case, Gingras v. Milwaukee County , the court emphasized that the distinction \"between illegal stereotyping and actual adverse effects on performance\" is the key in Title VII claims.54 It is not for the courts to decide whether an employer's behavior towards the employ ee is \"kind, a good business practice, or anything of the like.\"55 The court leaves the question for accommodation to \"the legislature or for individual employers themselves.\"56 Since leaving the problem to individual employers creates a risk for exasper ating the motherhood penalty (during and after the pandemic), it is time for the legislature to address this problem with the intent to offer equity and fairness for mothers. 49 Id. 50 Id. 51 Guglietta v.

An effective anti -discrimination parental caregiver law would focus on reducing discrimination by putting the duty on businesses to accommodate parents for bona -fide caregiving requests. Such laws permanent ly exist in many developed countries, including Canada, Great Britain, New Zealand and Australia.61 They require employers to set up a process to negotiate flexible work arrangements, and allow employers to refuse accommodations only for certain business reasons.62 Canadian Human Rights Commission places the duty to accommodate caregivers on employers.63 They note that the \"duty to 57 Rasheed Malik et al., The Coronavirus Will Make Child Care Deserts Worse and Exacerbate Inequality , CTR.

REV. 469, 484 (2011). 276 Advance Directive Vol. 30 employers and employees use to \"determine whether there is an accommodation that will allow a particular individual with disabilities to perform the essential functions of a particular job.\"72 Similarly, the federal government can prevent the exasperation of the motherhood penalty during this pandemic (and after) by enacting a legislation that pl aces the duty to accommodate a bona -fide parental caregiving need on employers. Like the ADA which requires an interactive process between the employer and employee, this legislation would require a dialogue between parental caregivers and employers. The parental caregiver must first demonstrate a bona -fide caregiving need and suggest a reasonable accommodation that would enable him or her to perform well at work. A reasonable accommodation may be flexible scheduling, an intermittent leave of absence, or an access to alternative work arrangements. The employer must then assess whether the accommodation would still allow the worker to perform the essential functions of a particular job . This would apply to mothers, fathers, or any other family members wh o provide caregiving for young children. If it places an \"undue hardship\" or there is a \"legitimate business reason\" for denying the accommodation, the employer may refuse the accommodation request. However, the burden would fall upon the employer to sho w that the accommodation would not be suitable for their business reasons. The United States should adopt the Canadian definition of bona -fide caregiving needs. In Canada, courts have held that a bona -fide caregiving need requires parent to demonstrate t hat he or she has \"made reasonable efforts to meet childcare obligations through reasonable alternative solutions, and is unable to reconcile competing family and work obligations.\"73 If the 72 Id. 73 Johnstone Decision Underlines Need for More Flexible and Inclusive Workplaces, WOMEN 'S LEGAL EDUC. & ACTION FUND, https://myemail.constantcontact.com/Where -a-2020 Accommodations for Parental Caregivers 277 childcare demand is beyond \"trivial or insubstantial,\" the emplo yer's duty to accommodate would arise.74 However, the employee does not have to prove she or he has done \"everything within his or her power\" to arrange childcare.75 The duty to accommodate is not a one -size-fit-all legislation. The appeal of this legislation is in its ability to recognize that parents have unique needs depending on their individual circumstances during the pandemic. With unprecedented barriers to other caregivers, parents need flexibility in their schedules: so me need to work remotely, some need to work less, and some need to take a few hours off during the day and work in the evenings to meet their children's needs. The requirement of an interactive dialogue would ensure that employers are not terminating empl oyees without taking the parents' bona -fide childcare needs into consideration. Since the legislation would have a balancing approach, it would ensure that any cost to employers is not overly burdensome. CRITICISM OF REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION Since businesses are already struggling during the COVID -19 economy, a criticism may present itself in the form of a legitimate concern for business owners. Some may feel that this legislation would limit the growth of our economy. That is why this legis lation requires the balance of reasonable accommodation with the needs of a business, without burdening it with undue hardship. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission defines an undue hardship under ADA as an accommodation that would be \"unduly workplace (last visited Nov 15, 2020). 74 Id. 75 Id. 278 Advance Directive Vol. 30 costl y, extensive, substantial or disruptive, or would fundamentally alter the nature or operation of the business.\"76 Certain factors are considered before an accommodation is provided.77 These factors include \"the cost of the accommodation, the employer's s ize, financial resources and the nature and structure of its operation.\"78 Legislation for caregivers must take a similar approach and allow for businesses to deny accommodation, but only if it presents an undue hardship. Another criticism of reasonable a ccommodations emphasizes choice. People choose to have kids, hence, they should not ask for better treatment . During this pandemic, this argument is moot because parents are not choosing for their childcare options to be closed. Even after this pandemic though, the choice reasoning \"ignores the fact that the choices given to the primary caretaker, who is usually the mother, are fundamentally unfair choices. \"79 A woman should not be given a choice for a biological need (for many but not all) and a need t o earn money. Joan C. Williams, the director and professor at UC Hastings' Work Life Law Department explains, \"[i]n the work/family context, the rhetoric of choice masks a gender system that defines childrearing and the accepted avenues of adult advanceme nt as inconsistent and then allocates the resulting costs of childrearing to mothers.\"80 Furthermore, single and divorced women, or women who do not have a high -wage earning spouse cannot simply choose not to work, but rather must work to provide the nece ssities for their families.81 Hence, the choice dichotomy fails during the pandemic and after it. 76 The ADA: Your Responsibilities as an Employer , EEOC , https://www.eeoc.gov/ publications/ ada-your-responsibilities -employer (last visited Nov. 15, 2020). 77 Id. 78 Id. 79 Kaminer, supra note 34, at 335 . 80 Joan C.

Most caregiving parents in the country are mothers, and hence, this phenomenon exasperates the motherhood penalty and expands the gender pay gap. To curtail this problem and to ensure equity in the workplace, the government should pass legislation requiring employers to provide reasonable accommodations for parents with bona -fide childcare needs. This legislation may model the Americans with Disabi lities Act which requires a balance between the employee's needs and the employer's business needs, while borrowing the definition of bona -fide caregiving needs from the Canadian Human Rights Commission. It must also require an interactive dialogue before employers can terminate parents due to their childcare obstacles. Although a duty for reasonable accommodation cannot resolve all the problems associated with the motherhood penalty, enacting a federal statute during this pandemic signals to the employer s that they must take this unprecedented childcare situation into account before discriminating against caregivers, who happen to be mostly mothers. 281 How a Pandemic Heightens Healthcare Issues for Individuals with Chronic Illnesses: A Case Against Excessive Cost -Sharing Meera Patel INTRODUCTION Cost-sharing is a way for both insurers and patients to split medical costs, making healthcare more affordable for the individual.1 Cost-sharing generally implies a burden on both insurance companies and individuals.2 However, the focus of this article will be on cost -sharing burdens on individuals.3 This method of payment has been increasingly use d by state Medicaid programs to promote financial responsibility and transition individuals to private insurance plans.4 At the same time, cost -sharing comes with many setbacks for vulnerable populations, specifically individuals with chronic illnesses.5 The definition of a chronic illness is when someone has a condition that has \"lasted or was expected to last twelve or more months and resulted in functional limitations and/or the need for ongoing medical care.\"6 The most expensive chronic illnesses include cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, obesity, arthritis, and asthma.7 1 Elizabeth David, An Overview of Health Insurance Cost -Sharing , VERYWELL HEALTH (Aug. 29, 2020, 6:45 PM), https://www.verywellhealth.com/what -is-cost-sharing -1738709. 2 Id. 3 Id. 4 LEIGHTON KU & VICTORIA WACHINO , THE EFFECT OF INCREASED COST-SHARING IN MEDICAID : A SUMMARY OF RESEARCH FINDINGS 2 (2005). 5 Framework to Address High Cost Burden for People with Serious Chronic Conditions , PARTNERSHIP TO FIGHT CHRONIC DISEASE (Sept. 12, 2020, 1:10 https://www.fightchronicdisease.org/resources/framework -address -high-cost-burden -people - Burden ]. 6 Wenke Hwang et al., Out-Of-Pocket Medical Spending for Care Of Chronic Conditions , 20 HEALTH AFF. 266, 268 (2020). 7 See generally Thomas Beaten, Top 10 Most Expensive Chronic Diseases for Healthcare Payers , HEALTH PAYER INTELLIGENCE (Sept. 12, Directive Vol. 30 Regardless of insurance coverage, chronic illnesses require more medical care, which in turn increases the cost -sharing burden for these individuals.8 Because of their g reater need for medical care, chronically ill individuals pay a higher percentage of their medical costs than individuals without chronic illnesses.9 In fact, a 2001 study showed that an individual without a chronic illness spent only $249 in 1996 for me dical expenses, compared to $1,134 for an individual with three or more chronic illnesses.10 Cost-sharing burdens on individuals were reduced under the Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\") since insurance companies pay a greater percentage than before the ACA, but the amount of reduction depends on the patient's health and health plan.11 While more individuals with chronic illnesses have health care coverage compared to before the ACA, their poor health causes cost -sharing burdens to remain high, creating ongoing challenges for this vulnerable population.12 During the COVID -19 pandemic, measures were taken to lighten cost - sharing burdens on individuals, and similar measures should be taken post COVID -19 for individuals with chronic illnesses. This article starts b y exploring the negative impacts of high cost -sharing on chronically ill individuals. Next, this article will focus on the changes made in response to high cost -sharing. Along with previous policy changes, this article will explore suggestions to help re duce high cost -sharing for chronically ill individuals. Additionally, this article will discuss the impacts of a pandemic (stating the top 10 most expensive chronic diseases are cardiovascular diseases, smoking - related health issues, alcohol -related health issues, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, obesity, arthritis, asthma, and stroke). 8 Hwang et al., supra note 6, at 275. 9 Id. at 274. 10 Id. at 270. 11Sarah R.

Finally, this article will analyze past changes and suggestions, impacts of a pandemic, and provide suggestions to help reduce cost -sharing for individuals with chronic illnesses post COVID -19. HIGH COST-SHARING HAD AND CONTINUES TO HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON CHRONICALLY ILL INDIVIDUALS While healthcare expenses tend to increase overtime, the increasing cost burdens on individuals receiving medical care, especially chronically ill patients, have many grave implications.13 In general, high c ost-sharing leads to an increased burden of health care costs, which directly leads to a substantial economic burden on patients, particularly those with chronic illnesses.14 As cost -sharing burdens on individuals increase, the utilization of health care services decreases for both necessary and unnecessary services.15 This in turn forces patients to ration what health care services they use.16 In this process, due to the lack of sensitivity to serious symptoms, individuals with chronic illnesses may not be able to differentiate between what is a necessary or unnecessary health care service.17 Chronically ill individuals not being able to tell this difference can result in patients not 13 See generally Melinda C.

One of these changes uses cost -sharing reductions (\"CSR\"), which lowers cost -sharing to the individual if he or she qualifies for the reduction.24 These subsidies lower out -of-pocket maximums and 18 Id. 19 KU & WACHINO , supra note 4, at 5. 20 Id. 21 PAN FOUNDATION , COST SHARING AND ACCESS TO PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS 4 (2016). 22 Alan R.

In concierge medicine services, upon receivin g a pre - determined fixed fee, physicians provide direct access to health care services.31 These types of efficient concierge services can be beneficial for individuals with chronic illnesses due to the fact that a physician will always 25 Health Insurance Subsides 2019: Are They Still Available? , EHEALTH INSURANCE (Sept. 12, - insurance -subsides -2019 -are-they-still-available [hereinafter Health Insurance Subsides ]. 26 Id. 27 Id. 28 Id. 29 Id. 30 Amanda Capritto, 5 Ways to Save Money on Healthcare if You Don't Have Health Insurance, CNET (Nov. 14, 2020, 4:50 PM), https://www.cnet.com/health/alternatives -to- traditional -health -insurance/. 31 to About Concierge - concierge -medicine.html. 286 Advance Directive Vol. 30 be available to man age periodical specialty visits.32 However, insurance may not be billed for these services, increasing costs of health care services for the individual.33 Additionally, cost -sharing programs, like Medi -Share, involve a community of people who agree to co ver each other's health care costs.34 Looking to the nature of these programs, they can be exclusive to certain groups of people, unfairly limiting access for others.35 Finally, medical discount cards can help chronically ill patients reduce out -of-pocke t expenses with benefit plans.36 However, especially for individuals with chronic illnesses, these plans may not cover or provide discounts for specific, necessary treatments.37 While these alternative options can help some chronically ill individuals, they are not addressing the needs of all chronically ill individuals, which shows that there needs to be additional measures to help lessen financial burdens on this vulnerable population.38 Along with federal policy and cost -sharing programs, experts in public policy have made suggestions to help reduce high cost -sharing.39 One of these suggestions is cost caps, which will limit how much certain individuals have to pay for out -of-pocket health care costs.40 There are many different types of suggested caps, however the ones that are most relevant to 32 Gabby Marquez, Why Concierge Medicine Isn't Just for Patients with Chronic Conditions , ELATION HEALTH (Sept. 12, 2020, 3:15 PM), https://www.elationhealth.com/direct -care-blog/why -concierge/. 33 Levine, supra note 31. 34 MEDI-SHARE , https://www.medishare.com (last visited Sept. 12, 2020). 35 Id. 36 Medical Discount Cards , ACS, https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/membership/member - benefits/personal -discounts/medical -discount -cards.html (last visited Sept. 12, 2020). 37See generally id.

For instance, insurance companies can waive the costs of necessary prescription medications or waive deductibles for common procedures in order to lessen cost-sharing burdens on individuals. Even though certain costs related to the pandemic are covered by insurance, there are still out -of-pocket costs.60 While COVID -19 testing is cove red under most insurance plans, alternative diagnoses may not be.61 In order for these alternative diagnoses to be covered, COVID -19 testing must be ordered during the visit.62 However, in this case, physicians may not always order COVID -19 tests due to the limited access to tests.63 Also, COVID -19 tests may not be ordered for patients with mild symptoms.64 55 Kao-Ping Chua & Rena M.

Changes to reduce cost -sharing burdens on patients before the pandemic involved the government providing aid to patients, and later insurance companies taking over that aid.81 Currently, insuran ce companies are receiving less help from the government.82 Instead of independently providing relief for individuals, it may be beneficial to implement a way for multiple systems to work together to provide reduced cost-sharing rates.83 This could mean that the government provides financial incentives to insurance companies for implementing reduced cost -sharing rates for individuals with chronic illnesses. If the government and insurance companies are able to work together to create a system of reduced cost- sharing rates, chronically ill individuals may be able to receive proper treatments for their conditions and not be hindered by excessive cost -sharing, leading to better health outcomes. Other changes for limiting cost -sharing, like concierge service s, cost - sharing programs, medical discount cards, can be very helpful for individuals with chronic illnesses.84 However, these programs can be difficult to access and even when accessed, may not provide the best financial services for chronically ill indi viduals.85 Chronic illnesses are diverse and require various degrees of medical care, which makes it difficult to implement a cost -sharing 80 See Haren et al., supra note 13 (noting implications include reducing utilization of necessary services, individuals forgoing medically necessary care, decrease in optimal care- seeking behavior). 81 Health Insurance Subsides , supra note 25. 82 Id. 83 Id (discussing how only the insurance companies are legally required to pay for CSR subsidies). 84 See generally Capritto, supra note 30. 85 MEDI-SHARE , supra note 34 (providing an overview of a cost -sharing program); ACS, supra note 37 (providing an overview of a me dical discount card program). 2020 Chronic Illness and Excessive Cost -Sharing 293 program with strict guidelines.86 For instance, treatment options of chronic illnesses may include medications, sur gery, physical therapy, or a combination.87 Similar to how cost -sharing reductions are for COVID -19 testing only and not treatment, many established cost -sharing programs are exclusive to what is covered.88 For example, the Chronic Illness Support Program covers usual health care costs for select chronic conditions.89 This program neglects treatments for exacerbated symptoms of some chronic conditions and basic care of others.90 Instead, there should be looser guidelines for receiving reduced cost -sharing for individuals with chronic illnesses, similar to how most insurance companies waive all COVID -19 tests, in order to increase access to health care services and decrease financial burdens on individuals. CONCLUSION Even though cost -sharing has be en used to promote financial responsibility and transition individuals to private insurance plans, excessive cost-sharing for chronically ill individuals can have grave implications.91 After the implementation of the ACA to decrease cost -sharing and progr ams to help reduce cost -sharing, chronically ill individuals still face tremendous 86 Adem Sav et al., Burden of Treatment for Chronic Illness: A Concept Analysis and Review of the Literature, 18 HEALTH EXPECTATIONS 312, 313 (2013). 87 Id. 88 Dedicated Plans for Chronic Conditions , CMTY.

For example, data from New York suggests that patients at underfunded community hospitals with fewer staff, worse equipment, and less access to advanced treatments were three times more likely to die as patients at well -financed academic medical centers in the wealthiest parts of the cit y.7 Similarly, geographical distance and a shortage of providers also contribute to disparities in access to timely, quality health care.8 In 2019, seventy -seven million people in the United States (\"U.S.\") lived in \"health professional shortage areas, \" which are designated as such due to geographic -, population -, or facility -based provider shortages in primary care, dental health, or mental health services.9 One tool being used to overcome the foregoing barriers to quality healthcare is \"telehealth,\" or \"the use of medical information exchanged from one site to another through electronic communications to improve a patient's health.\"10 Within the umbrella of telehealth exists \"telemedicine,\" which the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services define as real -time interactive communication between a patient and practitioner using two-way interactive electronic communications equipment.11 The COVID -19 pandemic catapulted telemedicine to the forefront of patient care due to stay -at-home orders and socia l-distancing measures enacted to minimize contact between about -health -disparities.htm (last visited September 11, 2020) (discussing why health disparities exist and the aspects of health they manifest in). 7 Brian M.

Next, this paper will argue that, although telemedicine has the potential to address traditional barriers to health ca re, it might paradoxically exacerbate the health disparities that low -income Black patients in urban communities face.

Rather than merely focusing on acute physical ailments, health care should account for the broader challenges faced by urban, low -income Black patients.36 Such challenges include stress from dealing with racial discrimination and barriers to living a healthy lifestyle such as access to healthy and affordable food options and safe environments fo r exercise and travel.37 30 See CDC HEALTH DISPARITIES & INEQUALITIES REPORT \u2014U.S. 2013 , CTR.

For example, as the expansion of telehealth continues, it is important to consider that telehealth 's potential benefits will not be realized without addressing the digital divide.38 Historically, the same populations that encounter disparities in healthcare coverage, access, and outcomes are also harmed by the digital divide.39 While nine in ten Amer ican adults use the Internet, people's digital lives appear noticeably different when considering factors such as race and income.40 For example, forty -four percent of adults with household incomes below $30,000 per year do not hav e home broadband services41 and forty -six percent do not own a traditional computer.42 In contrast, use of these technologies is nearly ubiquitous among higher -income Americans, who are also more likely to have multiple internet -enabled devices within one household.43 In addition to device ownership, Internet and broadband usage also varies across demographic groups.

Studies of the digital divide have widely lent themselves to researching disparities between rural and urban communities, while largely ignoring how race factors into the analysis.47 It is important to include race in such analyses, especially considering America's history of racial injustice. For example, research suggests that the \"racial digital divide\" for wired broadband is much larger than for mobile access.48 This gap could be explained by the mobile market's lower -cost plans, lack of credit checks, and marketing strategies specifically targeted at low -income Black and Hispanic families.49 On the other hand, wired -broadba nd includes higher capacity and faster speed options, but on the condition of passing a credit check.50 Black people have historically been the target of predatory loans, and are consequently more likely to have damaged credit, thus rendering them 44 Internet/Broadband Fact Sheet , supra note 40. 45 Id. 46 Anderson & Kumar, supra note 42. 47 Dana Floberg, The Racial Digital Divide Persists , FREE PRESS, (Dec. 13, 2018), https://www.freepress.net/our -response/expert -analysis/insights -opinions/racial -digital - divide -persists. 48 Id. 49 Id. 50 Id. 2020 Bridging the Digital Divide 303 ineligi ble for wired -broadband services.51 So far, policymakers have done little to address problems like the credit check barrier, which can systematically bar already -vulnerable populations from adopting broadband, and therefore exacerbate the digital divide.52 This example demonstrates the digital disparities that exist for urban Black communities, and highlights the importance of eliminating them, especially as COVID -19 relegates most facets of life to the screen. TELEMEDICINE EXPANSION MAY MAKE DIGITAL DISPARITIES A SOCIAL DETERMINANT OF HEALTH The rapid adoption of, and investment in, telehealth has transformed telemedicine into the baseline method of health care.53 According to a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report, by April 2020, telehealth was the mechanism used to provide nearly half (43.5%) of Medicare -funded primary care visits in February 2020, before COVID -19's classification as a public health emergency.54 Reports from private insurers corroborate telemedicine's accelerate d acceptance with telehealth claims increasing to sixteen million in June 2020, compared to about 500,000 in June 2019.55 51 Sarah Ludwig, Credit Scores in America Perpetuate Racial Injustice.

This disparity is because video visits are more like traditional, face -to-face visits and allow opportunities to use real time images for evaluation.73 Medicare and some private insurers have promised to reimburse video calls at the same rate they would pay for office visits.74 The result being that video calls are favored over telephonic health \"visits,\" which were often not been reimbursed in the past and have gained acceptance more slowly.75 Such policies may u nintentionally penalize providers with poorer patients who can only complete telehealth visits by telephone.76 On the other hand, there are cases where people are billed for phone conversations that used to be free because the fragmented shift to telemedi cine has induced providers to bill up front for services due to uncertainty regarding reimbursements .77 70 Id. 71 Id. 72 See Internet/Broadband Fact Sheet , Supra note 40 (containing statistics of broadband/internet usage analyzed by race).

If digital health solutions are not advanced equitably, disparities in healthcare access and outcomes will continue to increase for low -income, Black patients, who already constitute a large part of those who are most vulnerable in times of crises.89 83 Winkle et al., supra note 77 at 1117. 84 Id. 85 See generally Edward C.

If telemedicine is likely to transform th e future of clinical medicine, it is critical to anticipate and address disparities before they grow.90 Winkle et al. offer helpful solutions such as utilizing tech -enabled healthcare workers by integrating them into existing community programs,91 incenti vizing healthcare providers to play a greater role in such innovations through funding and community collaboration,92 and connecting patients with customized resources.93 Physicians and other medical professionals should embrace educational training on te lemedicine and digital literacy, as well as support their patients in these capacities.94 Further, in order to ensure that new technologies meet the low -income Black population's needs and are designed to accommodate their digital skill level, patients fr om these communities should be included in these collaboration efforts.95 Another proposed method to bridging the digital divide is increased use of store -and-forward technologies, which require lesser bandwidth compared to video visits.96 This method uses secure e -mail communications for the electronic transmission of medical information such as digital images, 90 Id. 91 Winkle et al., supra note 79, at 1119. 92 Id. at 1121. 93 Id. at 1120. 94 Bakhtiar et al., supra note 13. 95 Winkle et al., supra note 79, at 1121. 96 Bakhtiar et al., supra note 13. 310 Advance Directive Vol. 30 documents, and pre -recorded videos.97 Store -and-forward technology is asynchronous, meaning that the information is used to provid e services outside of real -time.98 This solution removes the need for coordinating schedules, since the provider, any specialist, and patient can all participate in the process when it is convenient for them.99 Aside from increasing efficiency, proponent s applaud this process as being able to overcome language and cultural barriers because it eliminates the need for real -time translation services.100 Another solution is forging city and nonprofit partnerships like those that are taking place in the sphere of public education to provide needed access to technological devices and Internet access.101 One such effort is Chicago Connected, which aims to narrow the digital divide for Chicago Public Schools (\"CPS\") families by providing up to four years of high -speed internet for CPS families most in need.102 The Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\") has also undertaken efforts to advance the adoption and accessibility of \"broadband -enabled health care solutions and advanced technologies.\"103 In 2017, the American Medical Informatics Association (\"AMIA\") responded to these efforts with a letter containing \"opportunities to address the digital divide's impact on health\" within the FCC's efforts.104 The AMIA suggested that the FCC and other government and local partners 97 Store -and-Forward (Asynchronous) , CTR.

CONCLUSION The COVID -19 pandemic has illuminated the healthcare disparities that Black, low -income patients in urban communities face. The \"digital divide\" should be considered among the other social determinants of health that contribute to these disparities. Consid ering this knowledge, lawmakers and healthcare providers should be wary of relying on telemedicine to the extent that it might further exacerbate health disparities for the urban, Black, low - income population.

First, this article discusses the effects of isolation on the accelerated decline in nursing home residents and examines the disproportionate effect of healthcare on the elderly. Next, this article analyzes how executive orders have essentially turned nursing homes into golden prisons for their residents. Third, it addresses how acce ss to FTFC enabled by technology can be used to aid and promote nursing home residents' health. Lastly, this article proposes that governors should be required to include FTT clauses in any executive order that mandates extreme social isolation for the el derly. Additionally, executive orders should require nursing homes to provide their residents with a minimum amount of FTFC with others each day.

EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND PROVISIONS FOR FACE-TO-FACE CONTACT On March 27, 2020, Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (\"CARES\") Act and President Dona ld Trump signed it into law.81 It released two trillion dollars in federal funding to battle the spread of COVID -19 in the United States and lessened the burdens felt by Americans due to the suspension of businesses and stay -at-home orders.82 The CARES A ct injected massive amounts of money to various sectors within the United States.83 Specifically, it designated $14 billion to farmers, $337 billion to small businesses with another $500 billion to small businesses that retained their staff, $100 billion for healthcare, and \"$1,200 for every adult American with an income less than $75,000.\"84 However, nowhere does the CARES Act specify any particular amount designated for one of the largest and most vulnerable populations in our country; it shamelessly fo rgot the elderly nursing home residents.85 80 Pam Greenberg, Legislative Oversight of Emergency Executive Powers , NAT'L CONF.

The CARES Act provided a twelve hundred dollar advanced tax credit for individuals.95 The stimulus check belongs to the nursing home resident, not the nursing home and is not considered income nor a Medicaid resource.96 Therefore, most nursing home residents should have received the twelve hundred dollar stimulus check under the CARES Act, to be used however they wi shed.97 The money furnished through the CARES Act is more than enough to provide every nursing home resident with a variety of options to ensure and improve socialization, such as a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) or foldable plexiglass partition, to allow in -person visits with family; or a touch technology device, such as a tablet to allow for remote interactions. The average cost of a tablet is one -hundred forty dollars.98 The average cost of a foldable plexiglass shield is seventy -nine dollars .99 The average cost of a PAPR is one -hundred eighty dollars.100 Combined, these three devices amount to a mere three hundred ninety -nine dollars, well short of the twelve - hundred dollars each resident should have received. Therefore, there is no reason that nursing homes are unable to provide measures which ensure that their residents have access to FTFC with others during their confinement. 95 Michelle Singletary, No, The Nursing Home Cannot Take Your Stimulus Payment , WASH.

In order to do t his, they must act in a more holistic approach in assessing not only to the public's health needs as a whole but incorporating assessments which identify and address the health needs of the most vulnerable populations. Practically, governors should be required to include FTT visitor exceptions within their strict quarantine orders and require that nursing homes provide a minimum amount of face - to-face contact with others each day to support their health and vitality. 107 Berkeley Lovelace, Why a Coronavirus Vaccine Might be Ready Next Year - and what Could go Wrong , CNBC (May 21, 2020), https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/21/coron avirus - vaccine -why-it-may-be-ready -early -next-year-and-what -could -go-wrong.html. 108 Donald G.

Indeed, overcrowding causes major health issues within the prison community and makes it difficult for a prison to adequately and effectively allocate resources to its prisoners.3 Our recently formed socially -distanced society due to COVID -19 has forced prisons to rethink the way they function and how to prevent the spread of the virus.4 The 1976 case, Estelle v. Gamble established that prisoners had a right to health care under the Eighth Amendment.5 Subsequent holdings have broadened this ruling by stating that not only do prisons need to afford adequate and timely health care, but that the services rendered must \"reasonably commensurate with modern medical science and of a quality acceptable within prudent professional standards .\"6 This signals t hat with 1 Statista Rs ch.

This analysis then concludes that prisons failed to take such basic precautions during pertinent times during COVID -19, which led to many prisoners experiencing grave illnesses and even death.12 This failure was deliberate indifference to prisoners' health and was violative of the Eighth Amendment.13 Therefore, remedies must be 7 Id. 8 See generally id.

Plata, affirmed Estelle and further held that the government has an obligation to provide basic sustenance to prisoners, including adequate medical care.17 Therefore, as long as a prison provides health care that meets a modern \"sta ndard of decency,\" a prisoner's Eighth Amendment right to health care will not be violated.18 These somewhat flexible holdings have led to an underwhelming health system within prisons.19 Medical care in prisons is typically scarce because of the difficu lty in hiring medical personnel willing to work in such conditions and for lower pay.20 Prisons usually have a clinic for inmates 14 See generally Franco -Paredes et al., supra note 1212 (inferring that it is necessary to prevent and mitigate the impact of COVID -19 in custodial settings). 15 See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 105 (1976) (where the court stated that not every claim raised regarding access to adequate medical treatment is a violation of the Eighth Amendment). 16 Id. 17 Brown v.

PROCEDURES IN PRISONS DURING COVID -19 With the emergence of COVID -19, the importance of social distancing, weari ng masks, and increasing sanitation cannot be understated to control the spread of the virus.25 However, prisons are epicenters for the spread of COVID -19 due to overcrowding, lack of testing, poor sanitation, and indifference to the health of prisoners, and as a result thousands of prisoners have been victimized.26 COVID -19 demands that prisons change their internal functions in order to comply with governmental recommendations and mandates, but many prisons have not implemented changes in 21 See id .

Lack of Social Distancing The social distancing methods called for by the Centers for Disease Control (\"CDC\") and other professionals is nearly impossible in the average prison due to overcrowding.28 For instance, at Marion Correctional Institution in Ohio, the inmate capacity was supposed to be capped at 1,500 but they reported over 2,000 COVID -19 cases by late April.29 The facility was able to house over -capacity limits because Ohio halted capacity reports to the U.S. Department of Justice in 2015, stating that the limits were not meaningful to the changing nature of the populations.30 This set a prece dent for many states to exceed capacity and/or misreport capacity numbers, diminishing a national capacity standard and leading to more prisons being able to get away with over -capacity.31 However, states have agreed that overcrowding contributes to the ra pid spread of COVID -19 and that social distancing is necessary to prevent the spread of the virus.32 After the report of over 2,000 prisoners infected, 27 See id. at 3 (stating that although changes have been made since COVID -19 emerged, there has been a disproportionate impact of COVID -19 on marginalized populations, such as prisoners, revealing structural violence that needs to be remedied). 28 See generally Alyssa G. Wurcel et al., Spotlight on Jails: COVID -19 Mitigation Policies Needed N ow, 71 CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES 891, 891 (Aug. 2020) (stating that social distancing is not feasible in jails because people are confined to small living areas and are often over capacity). 29 See Dara Lind, The Prison Was Built to Hold 1,500 Inmates. I t Had Over 2,000 Coronavirus Cases. , PROPUBLICA (Jun. -inmates -it-had-over-2000 -coronavirus -cases (further explaining that 2,000 inmates was just 80% of the total population at the facility and at 153% of the capacity limit). 30 Id. 31 Id. 32 Id. 334 Advance Directive Vol. 30 authorities decided to isolate infected prisoners from the healthy ones by moving the healthy into the gym.33 This was in late April, months after COVID -19 became a world -wide sensation; and while the facility did take measures to prevent continued spread, their lack of preventative measures before the virus infected many shows a deliberate indifference to the health of the inmates.34 The lack of preventative measures is deliberately indifferent based on the reasoning from both Estelle and Brown .35 The fact that prison authorities were aware of changes in the health system, knew that there were precautions that had been recommended to reduce the impact of the disease, but still failed to take even minimal steps to protect prisoners' health, contravenes the basic principles of human life and dignity.36 This is contradictory of the Estelle ruling regarding deliberate indifference and is violative of the Eighth Amendment.37 Limited PPE and Sanitation Methods In many prisons, soap and paper towels are not freely available for use and prisoners often have to pay for it through commissary.38 Many p risoners cannot afford to make purchases and have to wait to earn enough through their assigned work duties (which often pays under one dollar per hour) to 33 Id. 34 Id. 35 See generally Estelle v.

In the time of COVID -19, these customs turn into necessary precautions to prevent the spread and this is made impossible due to the lack of b asic resources, like soap, and properly functioning sinks and toilets.40 Not only does requiring the purchase of soap, a basic and abundant hygiene resource, offend basic human dignity, in a pandemic it violates a prisoner's right to health care under the Eighth Amendment.41 Courts should recognize that not supplying a basic necessity, such as soap, is deliberate indifference, as defined in Estelle , to what could gravely affect the prisoners.42 This deliberate indifference stems from inadequate planning, and prison officials should have understood when the pandemic became known that proper hygiene was a necessity to keep the prisoners healthy.43 Furthermore, most, if not all prisons, do not allow hand sanitizer and often treat it as contraband because of its alcohol content.44 Although some prisons have allowed certain forms due to the pandemic,45 it should be a priority to offer it in all prisons to prioritize the health of prisoners. While there may be 39 Id. 40 See id. (referencing that Mississippi prisons had dozens of broken sinks and toilets). 41 See generally Estelle v.

This is deliberate indifference because a reasonable person knew at the beginning of the pandemic that COVID -19 was to be taken seriously, and prison officials did not). 44 Byran Nelson, A COVID -19 Crisis in US Jails and Prisons , 128 CANCER CYTO PATHOL 513, 514 (2020). 45 Id. 336 Advance Directive Vol. 30 concerns of prisoners ingesting it, or otherwise u sing it for nefarious purposes because of its alcohol content46, the protective value of allowing it seems to outweigh the speculative risks it may pose. There are also safeguards to ensure that prisoners do not misuse it, such as having hand sanitizer av ailable only in supervised areas and not allowing it back to their living spaces.47 If prisons had taken this measure earlier in the pandemic, it could have helped slow the spread, even if minimally.48 Lastly, prisons have been deemed a high -risk environment for transmission of COVID -19, epitomizing the need for prisoners to have access to adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as face masks.49 However, along with many other resources, there has been an inadequate supply of PPE, includi ng masks, in prisons.50 The lack of PPE could have been prevented by better planning by prison authorities earlier in the pandemic, and due to lack of planning, the spread of COVID -19 in prisons has become close to uncontrollable.51 This is deliberate in difference to the health of prisoners, and many prisoners have been subjected to serious illness 46 TJ Macias, Hand Sanitizer can be Used for Nefarious Purposes, Say Prison Officials who Ban it, FORT WORTH STAR-TELEGRAM , May 5, 2020. 47 See id.

POLLUTION 1, 4 (2020) (referencing to a table ranking the lowest risk to highest risk environments and when wearing a face mask is mos t critical). 50 See Franco -Paredes et. al., supra note 12, at 3 (constant influx and overcrowding combined with inadequate PPE stockpiles led to limited supply for prisoners) (also inferring that this default can potentially spread the virus through contamination (for example, if a prisoner is given one mask to use for a month, the outside will be continuously contaminated through airborne particle s)). 51 See generally Carlos Franco -Paredes et. al., Covid -19 in Jails and Prisons: A Neglected Infection in a Marginalized Population , 14 PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES 1, 2-4 (2020) (stating that prisons have faced outbreaks before and were notified of COVID -19's implications but due to long -term neglect, the prison system could not take necessary steps to control the virus adequately). 2020 Unconstitutionality of Prison Health Care 337 and even death because of it,52 and this constitutes a violation of the Eighth Amendment requiring redress.53 Lack of Mass -Testing Initially, most prisons did not test prisoners for COVID -19 unless they were symptomatic.54 Despite recommendations from many officials and medical professionals, many states continued to not conduct mass -testing in prisons.55 Although some prisons have prioritized social distanci ng, this is nearly impossible with the layout of most facilities, emphasizing the importance of mass -testing to identify those who may be asymptomatic spreaders.56 Ultimately, the lack of mass testing in prisons has inevitably contributed to the spread of COVID -19 within facilities.57 Prisons should have prioritized mass -testing soon after learning that asymptomatic carriers could contribute to the spread, and not doing so, and continuing not to do so, was and is deliberate indifference to the health of t he prisoners.58 POTENTIAL REMEDIES TO THESE EIGHTH AMENDMENT VIOLATIONS As demonstrated, the procedures within prisons to tackle COVID -19 did not meet, and still have not fully met, the standards of health care afforded to prisoners under Estelle .59 Whil e prisons have worked towards implementing 52 See generally Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106 (1976) (stating that acts or omissions that are suffici ently harmful constitute deliberate indifference; therefore, the act of not supplying adequate PPE constitutes deliberate indifference). 53 Id. 54 See Nelson , supra note 44 at 514 (symptomatic prisoners were the only ones tested, and even sometimes they were not tested, only isolated). 55 Id. 56 Id. 57 Id. 58 See generally Estelle, 429 U.S. at 106 (prisons should have prioritized mass -testing soon after learning that asymptomatic carriers could contribute to the spread because not doing so was, and is, deliberate indifference to prisoners' health). 59 Id.; Nelson , supra note 4444. 338 Advance Directive Vol. 30 changes to reduce the spread of COVID -1960, more can be done to ensure constitutional requirements are met. The first suggestion, and most likely the easiest one to implement, is to make basic hygiene necessities, such as soap, hand sanitizer, and clean water, readily and freely available to all prisoners. Making soap available, along with having enough properl y-functioning sinks, can help to reduce the risk of spreading COVID -19 through surface contamination.61 The supply of soap, along with hand sanitizer at least temporarily, could be funded through county taxes.62 Furthermore, hand sanitizer should be avai lable to prisoners. Although hand sanitizer is labeled a contraband product due to its alcohol content,63 prisons need to balance the risks against the potential benefits from allowing the use of hand sanitizer at least temporarily. With the proper preca utions, the risk of prisoners misusing hand sanitizer can be substantially lowered and offering hand sanitizer, even in limited areas of a prison, can have substantial positive effects on the health of prisoners.64 This, combined with supplying soap, can help ameliorate the constitutional violation that has already occurred. 60 See generally Lind, supra note 29 (stating that many prisoners were moved into gyms to try to achieve social distancing); see generally Wang et al., supra note 49 (stating that some prisons have permitted the use of hand sanitizer). 61 See generally Coronavirus Disease 2019, CDC https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 - ncov/index.html (Last visited Oct. 17, 2020) (social distancing, wearing ma sks, and increasing sanitation are key measures advised by the CDC). 62 See Conor Friedersdorf, Can't We at Least Give Prisoners Soap? , ATLANTIC (Apr. 1, 2020) https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/make -soap-free-prisons/609202/ (stating that allocating taxpayer money to provide basic hygiene products in prisons could cost taxpayers less in the long -run as proper hygiene could reduce i llnesses requiring medical attention). 63 Nelson, supra note 44, at 514. 64 Macias, supra note 46 (explaining that although it has been shown that hand sanitizer can reduce the risk of COVID -19 transmission, many prison systems have maintained their ban on it due to the risk of prisoners using it for nefarious pu rposes). 2020 Unconstitutionality of Prison Health Care 339 While face masks were in short supply at the beginning of the pandemic, there are now enough to distribute among prisoners.65 It is recommended by the CDC that those within correctio nal facilities wear cloth masks,66 and these types of masks are feasible for lay individuals to make.67 Not only is it critical to ensure that all prisoners have access to masks, but also that there is education on how to properly wear, fit, and handle the masks to prevent contamination.68 Studies have shown that the proper use of cloth face coverings is critical to slow the spread of COVID -19 by preventing people infected from transmitting it to others.69 Through basic processes like these, the spread of COVID -19 can be lessened, even if marginally, further protecting prisoners' health under the Eighth Amendment.70 Testing is also crucial to determine who is a carrier of COVID -19. The CDC found that the prevalence rate of COVID -19 among tested prisoners was as high as 86.8%, exemplifying that testing can potentially help control 65 See Rebecca Heilweil, America Still Doesn't Have Enough N95 masks 10, 2020) https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/7/10/21319960/n95 -masks -shortage -trump -supply - chain (stating that there is still a shortage of N95 masks.

Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106 (1976) (inferring that prisoners must be afforded care that does not substantially harm them in order to adhere to the Eighth Amendment) (by providing something as attainable as cloth masks, the prison system is exhibitin g deliberate care for the health of prisoners); See Brown v.

Although this is the most complicated of the suggestions, it is arguably the most important to reduce the spread of COVID -19 and to protect priso ners' health. Since most prisons have not been built to support a socially -distanced lifestyle, I am suggesting that prisons utilize external facilities to house prisoners who are not deemed releasable or who need to be placed in medical isolation. For example, many schools and universities have been closed due to COVID -19 and remain unused until their reopening.75 These spaces, many of which have living -quarters like dorms and large gymnasiums, could be utilized to house prisoners who do not requi re a maximum -security facility. This could decrease crowding in prisons, therefore reducing the spread of COVID -19. While there is grey area regarding how this solution could be funded and how security could properly function, a source of funding could po tentially 71 See Liesl M.

Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, counties are responsible to provide prisoners with medical care, or else they face penalties.76 Therefore, since many county public schools are taxpayer funded and the facilitie s may not be in use for schooling purposes during the pandemic, these same funds could be used to maintain the facilities to house prisoners while students are not present. This can help meet the medical standards required under Estelle and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7198 3.77 Furthermore, some of the guards at the original prison could assume their position at the school facility during this time, decreasing the need to hire more guards and decreasing the chances that prison employees will be infected with COVID - 19 (since they will be more distanced). This deliberate planning will help counteract the deliberate indifference towards prisoners' health at the beginning of the pandemic. CONCLUSION The lack of planning during critical moments of the COVID -19 pandemic was deli berately indifferent to prisoners' health, violating their Eighth Amendment right to healthcare. This violation can be remedied though through deliberate planning, including but not limited to making basic hygiene resources available, mandating COVID -19 screenings, and utilizing external, free spaces to socially -distance prisoners. Through these steps, the prison system can ensure that prisoner's Eighth Amendment rights are protected. 76 Who Pays The Medical Bills For Inmates In the 2020). 77 See generally id.; Estelle v.
