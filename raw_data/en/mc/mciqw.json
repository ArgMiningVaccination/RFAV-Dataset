She was famous for peddling COVID-19 vaccine misinformation. The complications caused by the virus\u2014just a few weeks after attending a \"symposium\" against the vaccines - have killed her. \"Another tragedy and loss for our Republican family. Our dear friend Kelly Canon lost her battle with pneumonia today. Kelly will be forever in our hearts as a loyal and beloved friend and Patriot. Gone way too soon We will keep her family in our prayers,\" the Arlington Republican Club said in a [statement](https://www.facebook.com/groups/290878269403/announcements). Her death was said to be \"from COVID-related pneumonia.\" Canon had announced on Facebook in November that her employer had granted her a religious exemption for the COVID-19 vaccine. \"No jabby-jabby for me! Praise GOD!\" she [wrote](https://www.facebook.com/kjcanon/posts/10159743374608817) at the time. Canon had been an outspoken critic of COVID-19 vaccine mandates and pandemic-related restrictions. In one of her final Facebook posts, Canon shared several links to speeches she attended at a \"COVID symposium\" in Burleson in early December devoted to dissuading people from getting the COVID-19 vaccines that are currently available. The [event](https://www.godsaveourchildren.com/itinerary.html) was organized by God Save Our Children, which bills itself as \"a conservative group that is fighting against the use of experimental vaccines on our children.\" Canon had shared similar content on Twitter, where her most recent [post](https://twitter.com/kjcanon/status/1417155769062068224) was a YouTube video featuring claims that the coronavirus pandemic was \"planned\" in advance and part of a global conspiracy. As news of her death spread Tuesday, pro-vaccine commentators flooded her Facebook page with cruel comments and mocking memes, while her supporters unironically praised her for being a \"warrior for liberty\" to the very end. ___________________________ A religious exemption? What for heaven's sake is that? I feel sad for every death caused by COVID and its complications. If the death is caused by ignorance, it renders the sadness all the more profound. "}
