Antigenic variation is a unique characteristic of influenza virus. Antigenic drift generates seasonal influenza and antigenic shift results in the generation of pandemic influenza. Human influenza A and B viruses cause seasonal epidemics every year. In contrast to annual epidemics, worldwide pandemics of influenza occur infrequently in association with the unpredictable emergence of novel influenza A virus through antigenic shift [ [2](#B2)]. [3](#B3)]. Influenza A (H7N9) virus is thought to emerge by the reassortment of gene segments from at least four different influenza A viruses: H7 from duck, N9 from wild birds or chickens, and six internal gene segments from H9N2 influenza viruses of brambling birds and chickens [ [4](#B4) [5](#B5) [6](#B6)]. Multiple studies suggested that the origin of novel H7N9 virus in humans can be traced to live-poultry markets, where most H7N9-infected patients had direct contact [ [4](#B4) [7](#B7)]. As of December 3, 2014, 458 confirmed human cases and 177 deaths had been reported, with a mortality rate of 38.6%. Because of the increasing numbers of H7N9 infections in humans, rapid development of an efficient H7N9 vaccine is necessary. Different approaches have been applied by several manufacturers to develop influenza A (H7N9) virus vaccines [ [8](#B8) [9](#B9)]. Here, we evaluated the humoral and cellular immunogenicity of H7 HA DNA vaccine in a mouse model. Materials and Methods 1. Ethics 2. Immunization of mice [10](#B10)]. Female 6-week-old BALB/c mice were purchased from Orient Bio, Inc. (Seongnam, Gyeonggi province, Korea). Mice were divided into a na\u00efve (n = 7), vector control (n = 9) or DNA vaccine group (n = 21 for 25 or 50 \u00b5g, respectively) for a total of three vaccinations and immunized as described previously [ [10](#B10)]. Briefly, mice were immunized with the vector control (50 \u00b5g) or H7 HA DNA vaccine (25 or 50 \u00b5g) by intramuscular injection followed by electroporation using a CELLECTRA\u00ae adaptive constant current electroporation device (Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc., Blue Bell, PA, USA). Two 0.1-A constant current square-wave pulses were delivered through a triangular 3-electrode array consisting of 26-gauge solid stainless steel electrodes. Each pulse was 52 ms in length, with a 1-s delay between pulses. Mice were immunized at one to three doses, two weeks apart. Na\u00efve mice without immunizations were used as a negative control. Blood and spleen samples were collected two weeks after the last immunization ( [Fig. 1](#F1)). 3. Hemagglutination [10](#B10)]. a 70-mm nylon cell strainer (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) and incubated in media containing 10 ng/mL interleukin-2 for 48 h. Cells were plated in 96-well multiscreen filter plates (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) coated with purified rat anti-mouse IFN- capture antibody (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) in triplicate at 1 \u00d7 106 cells/well and stimulated by H7 HA peptides (GeneOne Life Science, Inc., Seoul, Korea) for 16 h. Biotin rat anti-mouse IFN- (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) was used as the detection antibody. Color development was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (ELISPOT Blue Color Module, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The number of spots on the plates was counted using an automated ELISPOT reader system (CTL Analyzer, Cellular Technology, Cleveland, OH, USA). 5. Statistical analysis Results 1. H7 HA DNA vaccine induced antibody production against H7N9 reassortant influenza virus in mice [Fig. 2A and B](#F2)). However, HI titers were greater than 40 after the second and third immunizations. Both the seroprotection and seroconversion rates were 100% in mice immunized with 25 or 50 \u00b5g DNA vaccine two and three times. After secondary immunization with H7 HA vaccine, the mean of geometric mean titer (GMT) was 79.98 (25 and D](#F2)). The GMTs after three doses of H7 HA vaccine were 159.96 in the 25 \u00b5g group and 215.28 in the 50 \u00b5g group (P = 0.18). 2. H7 HA DNA vaccine induced IFN- production in mouse splenocytes stimulated with H7 HA peptides [Fig. 3](#F3)). Two immunizations with H7 HA DNA vaccine induced significant increases in spot-forming units (SFUs) in both the 25 \u00b5g (234 \u00b1 91 SFU/106 splenocytes) vaccination groups; this enhancement was proportional to the increased number of immunization doses. In mice with three immunizations, 50 \u00b5g H7 HA DNA vaccination (357 \u00b1 39 SFU/106 splenocytes) enhanced IFN- production compared to 25 vaccination \u00b1 30 SFU/106 splenocytes, P \u00b5g vaccinations). Discussion [11](#B11) [12](#B12)]. However, they also have some limitations, such as low efficiency in immunogenicity in large animals and humans [ [13](#B13)]. To overcome the limitations of DNA vaccine, researchers have developed new delivery systems, including electroporation [ [14](#B14)]. For example, the efficacy of hepatitis B surface antigen and human immunodeficiency virus gag DNA vaccine was shown to be greatly enhanced by an electroporation delivery method in vivo [ [15](#B15)]. Moreover, when challenged with H1N1 influenza virus, mice immunized with DNA vaccine via electroporation recovered faster than mice immunized without electroporation [ [16](#B16)]. [17](#B17)]. Moreover, mice immunized with chitosan nanoparticles containing a swine influenza DNA vaccine showed humoral and cellular immunity [ [18](#B18)], and influenza A DNA vaccine delivered via electroporation provided full protection against H1N1 challenge in a mouse model [ [16](#B16)]. Our data demonstrate that the DNA vaccine against influenza virus induces humoral and cellular immune responses in mouse models. [10](#B10)]. In this study, we investigated the immunogenicity of this DNA vaccine against influenza A (H7N9) virus in detail, including two different doses of DNA vaccine and three repeated numbers of immunizations. Consistent with the previous report, DNA vaccination followed by electroporation efficiently induced antibody production and the IFN- response against the immunogen. However, when 25 \u00b5g DNA vaccine was injected, the induction of cellular immune responses in our study was lower than that in the previous study [ [10](#B10)]. This difference may be related to differences in mouse strains, intervals between immunizations, and time of sacrifice of mice after immunization. Overall, our results confirmed and supported the efficacy of the H7 HA DNA vaccine in inducing immunogenicity against H7 HA peptides in mice. [8](#B8)]. A cell culture-derived MF59-adjuvanted pandemic A (H7N9) vaccine was shown to be immunogenic and safe in adults [ [9](#B9)]. In addition to the development of these vaccines, our study suggests that the H7 HA DNA vaccine is also an effective tool for rapidly controlling emerging influenza viruses with pandemic potential. "}
