HOW TO MAINTAIN WEIGHT LOSS2 Loma Linda University Health A Healthy Tomorrow What can I do to help prevent common digestive disorders? A: You can start by taking these three simple steps: Eat a healthy diet. A diet high in fruits and vegetables, and low in meat and processed foods, is associated with a lower risk for digestive cancers, such as colon cancer. Exercise! This not only reduces your risk for heart disease and makes you feel better, but also improves the function of your digestive system. Get your screening colonoscopy at age 50, or earlier if you have a family history of colon cancer. Most people don't realize that this test actually prevents colon cancer by detecting polyps and removing them before they can become cancerous.

Th e disease occurs when stomach acid, food or liquid fl ows from the stomach backward up into the esophagus (the tube connecting the stomach and mouth). If heartburn causes problems in your everyday life, see your doctor. 4HEMORRHOIDS Hemorrhoids, or swollen veins in the rectum, are very common.

Anyone who takes too much of an opioid is at risk. If your doctor prescribes an opioid pain medicine, here's how to avoid a tragic mistake. ASK ABOUT ALTERNATIVES Prescription opioids are used to treat moderate to severe pain. /T_h ey may be taken after an injury or surgery, or for a health condition such as cancer.

Quick tips to keep you healthy!LIVE IT 4 Loma Linda University Health A Healthy Tomorrow ARE YOU DUE FOR A PAP TEST? Because early cervical cancer may not cause any symptoms, regular screenings can be a lifesaver. A Pap test detects precancerous cells that can be treated before cervical cancer even develops. The United States Preventive Services Task Force offers the following Pap test recommendations: Women ages 21 to 65 should get a Pap test once every three years. Women ages 30 to 65 can have a Pap test once every five years, along with a human papillomavirus (HPV) test. Women older than age 65 who have had normal screenings and do not have a high risk for cervical cancer do not need Pap tests. Talk with your doctor about the schedule that is best for you.

If you've ever tasted kombucha \u2014 fermented tea \u2014 there's no denying its unique flavor. The effervescent beverage is popular all over the world, and many of its drinkers have claimed that it has beneficial health effects. Research to back up those claims is limited, but don't worry, kombucha lovers: The USDA has deemed the beverage safe to drink. WHAT IS KOMBUCHA? Kombucha is made from a combination of tea, sugar, bacteria and yeast, and it sometimes has fruit juice or other flavors added to it. Through a process known as fermentation, the mixture sits for about 10 to 14 days and forms gas bubbles, as well as more yeast and bacteria. Although its ingredients may not sound particularly appetizing, its popularity has boomed in recent years.WHAT THE RESEARCH SHOWS Some kombucha enthusiasts claim that the beverage can lower blood pressure and cholesterol, reduce inflammation, boost the immune system, relieve headaches, help protect against cancer and more. But while research shows that kombucha is high in compounds such as antioxidants, polyphenols, B vitamins and vitamin C, studies have shown positive health effects only in animals, not in humans. A SURPRISING INGREDIENT Although considered a nonalcoholic beverage, kombucha actually contains small amounts of alcohol, which form during the fermentation process. The alcohol content can increase as the drink continues to ferment after it's been bottled and transported to stores. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should avoid kombucha. Talk with your doctor about whether kombucha is safe for you to drink.Studies have shown positive health effects only in animals, not in humans.6 /uni276F/uni276F Loma Linda University Health /uni276F/uni276F A Healthy Tomorrow/T_h e summer sun can feel wonderful on your skin. But to protect against skin cancer, painful burns and even wrinkles, it's important to use sunscreen year-round. MAKE UNDERSTANDING SUNSCREEN EASY AS ABC Sunlight consists of two types of harmful rays: ultraviolet A (UV A) rays and ultraviolet B (UVB) rays. UVB rays are the main cause of sunburn. UV A rays penetrate deeper into the skin and can cause suppression of the immune system. Excessive exposure to both forms can lead to skin cancer. Begin by choosing the right sun protection factor (SPF). Anywhere between SPF 15 and 50 is bene cial; higher numbers don't provide much added bene t. STAY COVERED Sunscreen should be applied generously to all exposed areas 15 minutes before you head outside. In addition to your arms and legs, protect your: /uni25A0Face, head, ears and front of neck /uni25A0Chest and abdomen /uni25A0Back and back of neck /uni25A0T ops of your feet Here are more tips to keep you protected: /uni25A0/T_h ink of the children.

Children age 6 months or younger should be kept out of direct sunlight entirely, if possible. /uni25A0Cream, stick or spray: It's up to you. Certain forms can work better for some skin types or body parts. For instance, gels apply more easily on hairy spots, while creams soothe your face and dry skin.
