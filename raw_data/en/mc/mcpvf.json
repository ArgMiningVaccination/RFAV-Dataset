Do you know anyone who's had Coronavirus and is suffering with Long Covid? I have recently completed a fantastic workshop with the renowned Reflexologist David Wayte in conjunction with the Association of Reflexologists to learn about this subject and how Reflexology may help build resilience and support the physical and emotional wellbeing of those with this condition. Long Covid is becoming a phenomenon that is being increasingly recognised and talked about however there doesn't yet appear to be a set medical definition or a specific list of symptoms. Professor David Strain from the University of Exeter works in the chronic fatigue clinic and spoke to the BBC. He reported there is no doubt that there is long covid and that symptoms can be lasting and severe but litle known about what to do for it as yet. There does appears to be a common theme of those who have and are discussing long covid as having ongoing and crippling fatigue, breathing issues, coughs, aches and pains, skin rashes, loss of smell, runny nose, headaches, gastric issues. Reflexologists are certainly not doctors nor do we claim to treat specific conditions however we can as holistic therapists help our clients with reducing stress, boosting immunity and enhancing a general sense of wellbeing. If you need a boost to your mental and physical health and wellbeing do consider a Relaxing Reflexology session I am delighted to be able to continue to offer you some of your favourtite treatments at home.
