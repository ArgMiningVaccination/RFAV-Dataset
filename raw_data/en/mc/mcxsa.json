HGTV's [Christina Anstead](https://www.housebeautiful.com/lifestyle/a34588961/christina-anstead-mom-shamed-after-divorce/) has been evaluating her own views as well as making discoveries about herself along the way. Anstead took to Instagram yesterday to speak on how she's been spending her downtime in 2020. \"I've been finding time to get to know myself more in the quiet,\" she wrote alongside a photo of herself on a balcony overlooking the beach with a glass of bubbly in hand. \"It can be isolating but it's also helped me begin to heal and get less uncomfortable in 'the void'\" Anstead continued to explain that her time spent reflecting this year led her to conclude that \"a lot of us have so much but aren't truly fulfilled.\" She uses herself as an example: \"I've felt this way too and while I want to slap myself sometimes for being so ungrateful it's true and we can't deny truth,\" Anstead wrote. Then she posed the question to her followers: \"If you feel this way too why do you think this is??\" Anstead then announced that she'll be working on a project next year to explore this disconnect more. \"Spiritual healing has been my passion for years so I'm looking forward to diving in deep,\" she wrote. She then ends her post on a note of gratitude: \"Despite a lot of crap there have been some really magical times - like this view .\" Anstead's plunge into the spiritual world\u2014as well as her desire to explore new beliefs and ideas\u2014is by no means new. During a season two episode of Christina on the Coast, Anstead took her best friend [Cassie Zebisch](https://www.housebeautiful.com/lifestyle/a27923795/christina-anstead-best-friend-cassie-zebisch/) to visit her acupuncturist and Chinese medicine doctor, Sheila Campbell. Anstead explained that she sought Campbell's help when trying to conceive her third child, Hudson London. After receiving acupuncture, [Anstead quickly overcame her infertility and became pregnant](https://www.housebeautiful.com/lifestyle/a33913924/christina-anstead-acupuncture-pregnancy/). Not to mention, Anstead shared in October that [she was done \"playing the game\"](https://www.housebeautiful.com/lifestyle/a34451760/christina-anstead-peace-after-ant-anstead-separation/) and getting caught up in \"nonsense.\" Instead, she would be \"choosing peace\" in the future, hinting that she was looking at her life through a more holistic lens. While Anstead doesn't give any details into this project she's working on, we're excited to see what she comes up with and learns about herself and others in the process. Perhaps another book?
