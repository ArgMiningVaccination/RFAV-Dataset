No. 108 -188 (2003))1 8. Announcement Type Initial 9. Program Category Preparedness: Emergency Management 10. Program Overview, Objectives and Priorities a. Overview The Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 Emergency Management Performance Grant (EMPG) Program is one of the grant programs that constitute DHS/FEMA's focus on all -hazards emergency preparedness, including the evolving threats and risks associated with climate change. Th ese grant programs are part of a comprehensive set of measures authorized by Congress and implemented by DHS. Among the goals noted in the DHS Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2020 -2024 , the EMPG Program supports the goal to Strengthen Preparedness and Resilience. The 2022 -2026 FEMA Strategic Plan outlines a bold vision and three ambitious goals designed to address key challenges the agency faces during a pivotal moment in the field of emergency management. Wide -ranging and long -term, the goals defined in the plan respond to the changing landscape in which we find ourselves. The goals to me et this challenge are: Goal 1 - Instill Equity as a Foundation of Emergency Management Goal 2 - Lead Whole of Community in Climate Resilience Goal 3 - Promote and Sustain a Ready FEMA and Prepared Nation These goals position FEMA to address the increasin g range and complexity of disasters, support the diversity of communities we serve, and complement the nation's growing expectations of the emergency management community. All EMPG Program recipients are encouraged to review the 2022 -2026 FEMA Strategic Plan and consider how FY 202 3 EMPG Program funding can be used to support the Plan's goals and objectives as they apply to state/territory's specific needs and the needs of the whole community. We in vite all stakeholders and partners to also adopt these priorities and join us in building a more prepared and resilient nation. b. Objectives The primary objective of the FY 202 3 EMPG Program is to provide funds to assist state, local, tribal , and territorial emergency management agencies to implement the National Preparedness System (NPS) and to support the National Preparedness Goal (the Goal) of a secure and resilient nation. T o that end, program objectives include : 1) building or sustaining 1 An additional $100,000 is funded pursuant to the Federal Programs and Services Agreements of the Compact of Free Association Amendments Act of 2003 (Pub. L. No. 108 -188 (2003)). 6 FY 2023 EMPG NOFO Back to the Top those capabilities that are identified as high priority through the Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (THIRA)/Stakeholder Preparedness Review (SPR) process and other relev ant information sources (see Priorities section below); and 2) closing capability gaps that are identified in the state or territory's most recent SPR . DHS /FEMA requires EMPG Program recipients to complete a THIRA/SPR. Additional information on the THIRA/SPR process, including other NPS tools and resources, can be found at National Preparedness System | FEMA.gov . Also refer to the FY 2023 Preparedness Grants Manual, Appendix H . (All references in this NOFO to the Preparedness Grants Manual are for the FY 2023 version.) c. Priorities All EMPG Program applicants are required to develop and submit a Work P lan as described in the \"EMPG Program Work Plan\" section of the Preparedness Grants Manual, Appendix H . All EMPG Program Work Plans will require final approval by the applicable FEMA Regional Administrator (RA). Prior to submission, the applicant must work with the RA or designated Regional EMPG Program Manager to ensure that appropriate regional and state/territory priorities are effectively addressed in the Work Plan. Priorities, and associ ated EMPG Program -funded projects, must be mutually agreed to by the recipient and RA. Identification of priorities and development of the EMPG Program Work Plan should involve a collaborative negotiation process through which a common set of priorities wi ll emerge based on a combination of state/territory priorities, regional priorities, and national priorities (as outlined in the table below). State/territory priorities should be primarily driven by the THIRA/SPR process, as explained in the Objectives se ction above. Other relevant information sources, such as: 1) after -action reports (AARs) following exercises or real -world events; 2) audit and monitoring findings; 3) Hazard Mitigation Plans; and/or 4) other deliberate planning products may also be used t o inform state/territory priorities. Regional priorities will be determined by the RA based on their unique knowledge of the region's preparedness and emergency management needs, including broader insight into common capability gaps across the region and p otential opportunities for economies of scale to capitalize on those commonalities. Regional priorities should also be based on an analysis of THIRA/SPR data and other information sources provided by the states/territories in their area(s) of responsibilit y. Ideally, all EMPG Program funded projects, as outlined in the approved FY 2023 EMPG Program Work Plan, will support the priorities identified through this approach. Through the priority development and negotiation process, each region and state/territ ory should discuss state/territory, regional, and national priorities. Converging their processes for identifying priorities and reaching consensus on a common set of shared priorities helps the region and each state/territory to realize economies of scale . As a result of these negotiations, the region and state/territory should reach a consensus on three to five priorities each recipient will focus on addressing and improving in its EMPG Program Work Plan. Federal regulations outlined in 2 C.F.R. Part 20 0 require federal awarding agencies to measure recipient performance to show achievement of program goals and objectives, share lessons learned, improve program outcomes, and foster adoption of promising practices ( see 7 FY 2023 EMPG NOFO Back to the Top 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.301, Performance measurement). For FY 2023, there is a continuing emphasis on priorities -based investments. Additionally, recipients must set outcome -oriented performance goals for closing capability gaps related to the three to five agreed -upon priorities, ali gning funding with high -priority strategic preparedness needs. An outcome - oriented approach will allow recipients to define success, benchmark their projects, and measure their progress in building capability. Recipients will be able to use this to generat e a feedback cycle . If projects are not achieving desired outcomes, recipients will have a basis for revisiting plans and assessments and adjusting their projects and other investments. Finally, there is a continuing requirement that at least 87.5% of all projects that include Planning, Training, and/or Exercise deliverables align with closing capability gaps identified and documented in the state/territory's most recent THIRA/SPR submission and other relevant information sources, as explained above. When developing state/territory priorities, applicants should consider the following national priorities, which correspond directly to the 2022 -2026 FEMA Strategic Plan and are further described belo w: Equity ; Climate Resilience ; and Readiness Equity Underserved communities suffer disproportionately from disasters. Disasters compound the challenges faced by these communities and increase their risk to future disasters. By instilling equity as a foundation of emergency management and striving to meet th e unique needs of underserved communities, the emergency management community can work to break this cycle of compounding risks and build a more resilient nation. Executive Order (EO) 13985 on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce (January 20, 2021) defines e quity as \"the consistent and systema tic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment, \" and further defines underserved communities as \"populations sharing a particular characteristic, as well as geographic communities, who have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life... such as Black and African American , Hispanic and Latino, Native American , Alaska Native and Indigenous, Asian American , Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders , Middle Eastern, and North African persons. It also includes individuals who belong to communities that face discrimination... (including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer persons )...\" The EO d efinition of underserved communities also includes members of religious minorities, persons with disabilities , persons who live in rural areas , and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. See Goal 1: Instill Equity as a Foundation of Emergency Management of the 2022 -2026 FEMA Strategic Plan for additional information on this topic. 8 FY 2023 EMPG NOFO Back to the Top Equity in emergency management requires proactively prioritizing actions that reinforce cultural competency, accessibility, and inclusion, as well as reflect the historical context of specific groups of people. T o that end, states and territories are strongly encouraged to explore how EMPG Program -funded activities can address the needs of underserved, at-risk communities to help ensure consistent and systematic, fair, just , and impartial treatment of all individu als before, during and after a disaster . The focus on equity and investing in strategies that meet the needs of underserved communities will strengthen the whole of community system of emergency management. Substantial and ongoing prioritization of, and investment in, underserved communities is essential for the entire system to be effective and efficient. Engaging the whole community requires all members of the community to be part of the emergency management team, including representatives of underserve d communities, diverse community members, social and community service groups and institutions, faith -based and disability advocacy groups, academia, professional associations, the private and nonprofit sectors, and government agencies that may not traditi onally have been directly involved in emergency management. The whole community includes children; older adults; individuals with disabilities and others with access and functional needs; those from religious, racial, and ethnically diverse backgrounds; pe ople with limited English proficiency; and owners of animals including household pets and service animals. To the extent possible, equity considerations must be factored into all FY 2023 EMPG Program -funded investments across all national priority areas. Additionally , applicants are required to designate at least one project in their FY 2023 EMPG Program Work Plan and budget narrative that specifically addresses equity considerations. Climate Resilience Climate change is one of the greatest challenge s facing emergency managers today , and it will continue to shape the field of emergency management for the next several decades. To meet this challenge, the emergency management field needs to anticipate the increasing demands generated by more extreme and frequent disasters , from wildfires and coastal storms to inland flooding. Additionally, emergency managers must learn to manage and support climate -related emergencies such as drought and ext reme heat. Natural disasters , worsened by the effects of climate change, often disproportionately affect people in underserved communities where weakened infrastructure, fewer resources, and less support invest ed in hazard mitigation can compound a disaste r's impact. Therefore, FEMA recommends that climate change and resilience considerations be cornerstones of how the nation builds resilien t communities . Emergency managers at the federal, state , territor ial, tribal , and local levels need to undertake targe ted efforts to increase resilience , including climate resilience, for underserved individuals and communities. Climate change has both acute and chronic impacts ; communities must be resilient against threats as varied as extreme flooding, drought, hurrica nes, and wildfires. Many communities are faced with aging infrastructure, which can increase risk from major disasters. As the frequency of these disasters accelerates, FEMA must increase climate adaptation investments across the nation. To have the greate st impact, FEMA encourages smart investments in 9 FY 2023 EMPG NOFO Back to the Top system -based, community -wide projects to protect those with the most severe and persistent risk. Communities can better target investments to the most transformational projects when they better understand the unique risks posed by climate change. The future disaster environment will not resemble that of the past, or even what is experienced today. To build long -term resilience, communities must understand their future risk and have the resources and capaci ty to reduce that risk. Even within the same geographic area, different communities will face differing levels of risk due to their unique demographic, economic, and physical char acteristics. It is important for the emergency management community to develo p capacity to access and interpret accurate information about this localized risk, specifically in light of future conditions. This information will help communities better understand their own risks and identify the most appropriate resilience actions. See Goal 2 : Lead Whole of Community in Climate Resilience of the 2022 -2026 FEMA Strategic Plan for additional information on this topic . Climate resilience considerations will be a continued area of focus for FY 2024. Readiness As disasters become more frequent, severe, and complex, the demands placed upon the emergency management community , as well as federal resources, have increased dramatically. To adapt to th is trend, FEMA and the emergency management community must expand our approach to readiness , preparedness , and resiliency by increasing the overall emergency management capabilities at all levels of government, a s well as the private sector, the nonprofit sector, and among individuals. The National Capability Targets provide a shared vision of the staff, expertise, tools, and resources required to build a prepared nation. Aligning state and local readiness plans to these targets will ensure agencies can continuously support the needs and priorities identified by whole community partners, in addition to continuity of government across all hazards. Disaster mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery are not the responsibility of just one agency. Rather, these functions are a shared responsibility requiring coordination of federal agencies, private and social sectors, state, local, tribal, and t erritorial governments, and other partners. The ability to support communities begins with how emergency management agencies help them prepare before a disaster occurs. Through better coordination of pre -disaster programs, we can all help communities ident ify, prioritize, and plan to address their specific community -based threats, identify hazards and risks, and mitigate capability gaps. Together , federal assistance can be targeted to address areas of greatest national risk and increase support to the most at-risk communities. See Goal 3 : Promote and Sustain a Ready FEMA and Prepared Nation of the 2022 -2026 FEMA Strategic Plan for additi onal information on this topic. Additional Guidance on EMPG Program Priorities Recognizing that every state and territory has its own unique preparedness and emergency management needs, the national priorities outlined above should inform the identifi cation of state/territory priorities and regional priorities when developing the common set of mutual priorities as agreed upon by the RA and each state/territory . Ideally, the regional and 10 FY 2023 EMPG NOFO Back to the Top state/territory priorities will complement and support th e national priorities. In addition to the requirement that at least one project address equity considerations, t he only other mandate stemming from these national priorities is the requirement for all EMPG Program recipients to develop and maintain a Distr ibution Management Plan as an annex to their existing Emergency Operations Plan (EOP). See the Logistics Planning section of the Preparedness Grants Manual, Appendix H for additional detail s on this requirement. Consistent with FY 2022, s tates and territories are encouraged to identify whether and how each project included in their EMPG Program Work Plan addresses equity -related considerations, or the impacts associated with climate change (as applicable). This guidance is in addition to the requirement that at least one project focus specifically on equity considerations . The reporting of this information will allow FEMA to better understand how states and territories are using EMPG Program funding to support equity and climate resilience. See the Preparedness Grants Manual, Appendix H for more information about the requirements for addressing these priorities in the EMPG Pro gram Work Plan submission. The t able below provides a high -level breakdown of the national priority areas, the associated core capabilities, as well as examples of project types for each area. A detailed description of allowable investments for each project type is included in the Preparedness Grants Manual, Appendix H .

Further, the Authorized Organization Representative (AOR) must be a duly authorized current employee, personnel, official, staff or leadership of the recipient and provide an email address unique to the reci pient at the time of application and upon any change in assignment during the period of performance . Consultants or contractors of the recipient are not permitted to be the AOR of the recipient. 3. Other Eligibility Criteria/Restrictions a. National Incident Management System (NIMS) Implementation Prior to allocation of any federal preparedness awards, recipients must ensure and maintain adoption and implementation of NIMS. The list of objectives used for progress and achievement reporting i s on FEMA's website at NIMS Implementation and Training | FEMA.gov . Relatedly, as a post -award requirement for F Y 2023, all recipients and subrecipients in the 50 states and the District of Columbia must work toward achieving the Phase 1 National Qualification System (NQS) implementation objectives and must, at a minimum, execute the Implementation Plan they developed last year as part of the Phase 0 NQS Implementation Objectives. All other jurisdictions (including territories and FY 2023 EMPG Program subrecipients ) are required to work toward implementation of NQS by developing an Implementation Plan . Please see the Preparedness Grants Manual, Appendix H for more information on NIMS and NQS implementation requirements. b. Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC) Membership In support of the Goal, EMPG Program recipients must belong to , be located in, or act as an EMAC temporary member state, except for American Samoa, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, which are not currently subject to these r equirements. All assets supported 16 FY 2023 EMPG NOFO Back to the Top in part or entirely with FY 2023 EMPG Program funding must, where applicable, be readily deployable to support emergency or disaster operations per existing EMAC agreements. 4. Cost Share or Match The FY 2023 EMPG Progra m has a cost -share requirement. The recipient contribution can be cash (hard match) or third -party in -kind (soft match). Eligible EMPG Program applicants shall agree to make available non -federal funds to carry out an EMPG Program award in an amount not le ss than 50% of the total project cost. In other words, the federal share applied toward the EMPG Program budget shall not exceed 50% of the total budget as submitted in the application and approved in the award. If the total project ends up costing more, t he recipient is responsible for any additional costs; if the total project ends up costing less, the recipient may owe FEMA an amount required to ensure that the federal cost share is not in excess of 50%. A state must at least equally match (cash or third party in -kind) the federal contribution pursuant to sections 611(j) and 613(a) of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Pub. L. No. 93 -288), as amended, (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5121 et seq.). Unless otherwise authorized by law, federa l funds cannot be matched with other federal funds. The recipient's contribution should be specifically identified. These non - federal contributions have the same eligibility requirements as the federal share. DHS/FEMA administers cost -matching requireme nts in accordance with 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.306. To meet matching requirements, the recipient contributions must be verifiable, reasonable, allowable, allocable, necessary under the grant program, and in compliance with all applicable federal requirements and r egulations. For example, if the federal award were at a 50% cost share and the total approved budget cost was $100,000, then: Federal share is 50% of $100,000 = $50,000 Recipient share is 50% of $100,000 = $50,000 However, with this example, if the total cost ended up being $120,000, the federal share would remain at 50% of the total approved budget at the time of application of $100,000, or $50,000. If the total cost e nded up being $80,000, then the 50% federal share would decrease to $40,000, and the recipient cost share would be $40,000. In accordance with 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1469a, cost -match requirements are waived for the insular areas of the U.S. territories of America n Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, as well as the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. See the Preparedness Grants Manual, Appendix H , for additional cost share/match guidance. D. Application and Submission Information 1. Key Dates and Times a.

To access these materials, go to Home | Grants.gov . 4. Requirements: Obtain a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) and Register in the System for Award Management (SAM) Each applicant, unless they have a valid exception under 2 CFR 25.110, must: 1) Be re gistered in Sam.Gov before application submission. 2) Provide a valid Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) in its application. 3) Continue to always maintain an active System for Award Management (SAM) registration with current information during the Federal Award pr ocess. 5. Steps Required to Obtain a Unique Entity Identifier, Register in the System for Award Management (SAM), and Submit an Application Applying for an award under this program is a multi -step process and requires time to complete. Applicants are encouraged to register early as the registration process can take four weeks or more to complete. Therefore, registration should be done in sufficient time to ensure it does not impact your ability to meet required submission deadlines. Please review the table above for estimated deadlines to complete each of the steps listed. Failure of an applicant to comply with any of the required steps before the deadline for submitting an application may disqualify that application from funding. To apply for an award under this program, all applicants must: Event Suggested Deadline for Completion Registering in SAM or updating SAM registration Four weeks before actual submission deadline Registering in Grants.gov Four weeks before actual submission deadline Registering in ND Grants Four weeks before actual submission deadline Starting application in Grants.gov One week before actual submission deadline Submitting application in Grants.gov Three days before actual submission deadline Submitting the final application in FEMA's ND Grants By the submission deadline 19 FY 2023 EMPG NOFO Back to the Top a. Apply for, update, or verify their Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) number from SAM.gov and Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the Internal Revenue Service; b. In the application, provide an UEI number; c. Have an account with login.gov ; d. Register for, update, or verify their SAM account and ensure the account is active before submitting the application; e. Create a Grants.gov account; f. Add a prof ile to a Grants.gov account; g. Establish an Authorized Organizational Representative (AOR) in Grants.gov; h. Register in ND Grants i. Submit an initial application in Grants.gov ; j.

Specific instructions on how to apply for, update, or verify an UEI number or SAM registration or establish an AOR are included below in the steps for applying through Grants.gov. Applicants are advised that FEMA may not make a federal award until the applicant has complied with all applicable SAM requirements. Therefore, an applicant's SAM registration must be active not only at the time of application, but also during the application review period and when FEMA is ready to make a federal award. Further, as noted above, an applicant's or recipient's SAM registration must remain active for the duration of an active federal award. If an applicant's SAM registration is expired at the time of application, expires during application review, or expires any other time before award, FEMA may determine that the applicant is not qualified to receive a federal award and use that determination as a basis for making a federal award to another applicant. Per 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 25.110(c)(2)(iii), if a n applicant is experiencing exigent circumstances that prevents it from obtaining an UEI number and completing SAM registration prior to receiving a federal award, the applicant must notify FEMA as soon as possible by contacting askcsid@fema.dhs.gov and providing the details of the circumstances that prevent completion of these requirements. If FEMA determines that there are exigent circumstances and FEMA has decided to make an award, the applicant will be require d to obtain an UEI number, if applicable, and complete SAM registration within 30 days of the federal award date. 6.

Application Evaluation Criteria a. Programmatic Criteria Please see the Preparedness Grants Manual, Appendix H for information on Application Evaluation Criteria. b. Financial Integrity Criteria 27 FY 2023 EMPG NOFO Back to the Top Prior to making a federal award, FEMA is required by 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3354 , as enacted by the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019, Pub. L. No. 116 -117 (2020); 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 2313; and 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.206 to review information available through any Office of Management and Budget (OMB) -designated repositories of governmentwide eligibility qualification or financial integrity information, including whether the applicant is suspended or debarred. FEMA may also pose additional questions to the applicant to aid in conducting the pre -award risk review. Therefore, application evaluati on criteria may include the following risk -based considerations of the applicant: i. Financial stability ; ii. Quality of management systems and ability to meet management standards ; iii. History of performance in managing federal award ; iv. Reports and findings from audits ; and v. Ability to effectively implement statutory, regulatory, or other requirements. c. Supplemental Financial Integrity Criteria and Review Prior to making a federal award where the anticipated total federal share will be greater than the simplified acquisition threshold, currently $250,000: i. FEMA is required to review and consider any information about the applicant, including information on the applicant's immediate and highest -level owner, subsidiaries, and predecessors, if applicable, that is in the designated integrity and performance syst em accessible through the System for Award Management (SAM), which is currently the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS). ii. An applicant, at its option, may revie w information in FAPIIS and comment on any information about itself that a federal awarding agency previously entered. iii. FEMA will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to the other information in FAPIIS, in making a judgment about the ap plicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.206. 2. Review and Selection Process Recipients must comply with all administrative requirements described herein including the submission of the EMPG Program Work Plan and other application materials as required. The following process will be used to make awards for the EMPG Program: a. Initial Review The Regional EMPG Program Managers co nduct all pre -award reviews for EMPG Program grant awards. All EMPG Program Work Plans require final approval by the RA. Prior to submission of the EMPG Program Work Plan, the applicant must work with the RA or designated Regional EMPG Program Manager to e nsure that regional or state priorities are properly addressed in the EMPG Program Work Plan. 28 FY 2023 EMPG NOFO Back to the Top Funds for recipients will not be released until such Work Plan is received, reviewed, and approved by DHS/FEMA. Recipients will be notified by the RA or their Re gional EMPG Program Manager should any component of the EMPG Program application require additional information. b. Overall Review FEMA Regions are responsible for reviewing submitted applications. Each Regional EMPG Program Manager reviews the FY 202 3 EMPG Program Work Plans for their states or territories to assess the proposed EMPG Program investments against the agreed upon priorities. This will include a financial review using the following criteria: Allowability, allocability, and financial reaso nableness of the proposed budget and investment information ; and Whether a recipient meets the financial and legal requirements listed in 2 C.F.R.

Pass -Through Requirements Each state or territory shall obligate 100 % of its total EMPG Program allocation to the designated state -level EMA. If the SAA is also the EMA, this requirement is automatically met. If the SAA is a separate agency or has a separate budget process, then all EMPG Program funds must be obligated to t he EMA within 15 days of the grant award date. In 29 FY 2023 EMPG NOFO Back to the Top instances where the state EMA is making subawards to local jurisdictions, DHS/FEMA expects the state EMA to make these subawards as expeditiously as possible . 3. Administrative and National Policy Requirements In addition to the requirements of in this section and in this NOFO, FEMA may place specific terms and conditions on individual awards in accordance with 2 C.F.R. Part 200.

Environmental Planning and Historic Preservation (EHP) Compliance As a federal agency, FEMA is required to consider the effe cts of its actions on the environment and historic properties to ensure that all activities and programs funded by FEMA, including grant -funded projects, comply with federal EHP laws, Executive Orders, regulations, and policies, as applicable. All non -critical new construction or substantial improvement of structures in a Special Flood Hazard Area must, at a minimum, apply the flood elevations of the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard's Freeboard Value Approach unless doing so would cause the project to be unable to meet applicable program cost -effectiveness requirements. All other types of projects may choose to apply the flood elevations of the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard's Freeboard Value Approach. See Executive Order (EO) 14030, Climate -Related Financial Risk and FEMA Policy # -206-21-0003, Partial Implementation of the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard for Hazard Mitigation Assistance Programs (Interim) (fema.gov) . All GPD actions, including grant -funded actions, must comply with National Flood Insurance Program criteria or any more restrictive federal, state, or local floodplain management standards or building code (44 CFR \u00a7 9.11(d)(6)). All GPD -funded non -critical actions in 1% annual chance floodplains (also known a s 100 -year floodplains) that involve new construction or substantial improvement of structures must be elevated, at a minimum, to the lower of: Two feet above the 1% annual chance flood elevation (also known as the base flood elevation), in accordance with the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard (FFRMS) \"Freeboard Value Approach\" (FVA); or The 0.2% annual chance flood elevation. Where 0.2% annual chance flood elevations are not available, such actions must be elevated to at least two feet above the 1% annual chance flood elevation. All GPD -funded critical actions in 0.2% annual chance floodplains (also known as 500 -year floodplains) that involve new construction or substantial improvement of structures must be elevated, at a mini mum, to the higher of: Three feet above the 1% annual chance flood elevation; or The 0.2% annual chance flood elevation. Where 0.2% annual chance flood elevations are not available, such actions must be elevated to at least three feet above the 1% annual chance flood elevation. 31 FY 2023 EMPG NOFO Back to the Top See EO 11988, Floodplain Management , as amended by EO 13690, Establishing a Federal Flood Risk Management Standard and a Process for Further Soliciting and Considering Stakeholder Input . Recipient s and subrecipients proposing projects that have the potential to impact the environment, including, but not limited to, the construction of communication towers, modification or renovation of existing buildings, structures, and facilities, or new construc tion including replacement of facilities, must participate in the FEMA EHP review process. The EHP review process involves the submission of a detailed project description along with any supporting documentation requested by FEMA in order to determine whet her the proposed project has the potential to impact environmental resources or historic properties. In some cases, FEMA is also required to consult with other regulatory agencies and the public in order to complete the review process. Federal law requir es EHP review to be completed before federal funds are released to carry out proposed projects. FEMA may not be able to fund projects that are not incompliance with applicable EHP laws, Executive Orders, regulations, and policies. DHS and FEMA EHP policy is found in directives and instructions available on the FEMA.gov EHP page , the FEMA website page that includes documents regarding EHP responsibilities and program requir ements, including implementation of the National Environmental Policy Act and other EHP regulations and Executive Orders. The GPD EHP screening form is located at FEMA Form . Additionally, all recipients under this funding opportunity are required to comply with the FEMA GPD EHP Policy Guidance, FEMA Policy #108 -023-1. 4. Reporting Recipients are required to submit various financial and programmatic reports as a condition of award acceptance. Future awards and funds drawdown may be withheld if these reports are delinquent. See the Preparedness Grants Manual Appendix H for information on reporting requi rements. 5. Monitoring and Oversight Per 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.337, FEMA, through its authorized representatives, has the right, at all reasonable times, to make site visits or conduct desk reviews to review project accomplishments and management control systems to review award progress and to provide any required technical assistance. During site visits or desk reviews, FEMA will review recipients' files related to the award. As part of any monitoring and program evaluation activities, recipients must permit FEM A, upon reasonable notice, to review grant -related records and to interview the organization's staff and contractors regarding the program. Recipients must respond in a timely and accurate manner to FEMA requests for information relating to the award. 32 FY 2023 EMPG NOFO Back to the Top See the Preparedness Grants Manual for information on monitoring and oversight.

Termination Provisions FEMA may terminate a federal award in whole or in part for one of the following reasons. FEMA and the recipient must still comply with closeout requirements at 2 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 200.344 -200.345 even if an award is terminated in whole or in part. To the extent that subawards are permitted under this NOFO, pass-through entities should refer to 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.340 for additional information on termination regarding subawards. a. Noncompliance If a recipient fails to c omply with the terms and conditions of a federal award, FEMA may terminate the award in whole or in part. If the noncompliance can be corrected, FEMA may first attempt to direct the recipient to correct the noncompliance. This may take the form of a 34 FY 2023 EMPG NOFO Back to the Top Compli ance Notification. If the noncompliance cannot be corrected or the recipient is non - responsive, FEMA may proceed with a Remedy Notification, which could impose a remedy for noncompliance per 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.339, including termination. Any action to terminat e based on noncompliance will follow the requirements of 2 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 200.341 -200.342 as well as the requirement of C.F.R. \u00a7 200.340(c) to report in FAPIIS the recipient's material failure to comply with the award terms and conditions. See also the sectio n on Actions to Address Noncompliance in this NOFO or in the Preparedness Grants Manual . b. With the Consent of the Recipient FEMA may also terminate an award in whole or in part with the consent of the recipient, in which case the parties must agree upon the termination conditions, including the effective date, and in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. c. Notification by the Recipient The recipie nt may terminate the award, in whole or in part, by sending written notification to FEMA setting forth the reasons for such termination, the effective date, and in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. In the case of partial termin ation, FEMA may determine that a partially terminated award will not accomplish the purpose of the federal award, so FEMA may terminate the award in its entirety. If that occurs, FEMA will follow the requirements of 2 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 200.341 -200.342 in deciding to fully terminate the award. 2. Program Evaluation Recipients and subrecipients are encouraged to incorporate program evaluation activities from the outset of their program design and implementation to meaningfully document and measure their progress towards meeting an agency priority goal(s). Title I of the Foundations for Evidence -Based Policymaking Act of 2018 ( Evidence Act ), Pub. L. No. 115 -435 (2019) urges fede ral awarding agencies and federal assistance recipients and subrecipients to use program evaluation as a critical tool to learn, to improve equitable delivery, and to elevate program service and delivery across the program lifecycle. Evaluation means \"an a ssessment using systematic data collection and analysis of one or more programs, policies, and organizations intended to assess their effectiveness and efficiency.\" Evidence Act \u00a7 101 (codified at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 311). Evaluation costs are allowable costs (eith er as direct or indirect), unless prohibited by statute or regulation. In addition, recipients are required to participate in a DHS -led evaluation if selected, which may be carried out by a third -party on behalf of the Program Office or DHS. By accepting grant funds, recipients agree to participate in the evaluation, which may include analysis of individuals who benefit from the grant, and provide access to program operating personnel and participants, as specified by the evaluator(s) during the award. 3. Period of Performance Extensions Extensions to the period of performance for this program are allowed. Extensions to the POP identified in the award will only be considered through formal, written requests to the recipient's FEMA Regional Program Analy st and must contain specific and compelling justifications as to why an extension is required. Recipients are advised to coordinate with 35 FY 2023 EMPG NOFO Back to the Top the FEMA Regional Program Analyst as needed when preparing an extension request. Please see the Preparedness Grants Manual, Appendix H for further instructions. 4. Financial Assistance Programs for Infrastructure a. Build America, Buy America Act Recipients and subrecipients must comply with the Build America, Buy America Act (BABAA), which was enacted as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act \u00a7\u00a7 70901 -70927, Pub. L. No. 117 -58 (2021); and Executive Order 14005, Ensuring the Future is Made in All of America by All of America's Wor kers. See also Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Memorandum M -22-11, Initial Implementation Guidance on Application of Buy America Preference in Federal Financial Assist ance Programs for Infrastructure . None of the funds provided under this program may be used for a project for infrastructure unless the iron and steel, manufactured products, and construction materials used in that infrastructure are produced in the Unite d States. The Buy America preference only applies to articles, materials, and supplies that are consumed in, incorporated into, or affixed to an infrastructure project. As such, it does not apply to tools, equipment, and supplies, such as temporary scaffo lding, brought to the construction site and removed at or before the completion of the infrastructure project. Nor does a Buy America preference apply to equipment and furnishings, such as movable chairs, desks, and portable computer equipment, that are us ed at or within the finished infrastructure project but are not an integral part of the structure or permanently affixed to the infrastructure project. To see whether a particular FEMA federal financial assistance program is considered an infrastructure p rogram and thus required to include a Buy America preference, please see Programs and Definitions: Build America, Buy America Act | FEMA.gov and Build America, Buy America Act Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) | FEMA.gov . Additional information is found in Buy America Preference in FEMA Financial Assistance Programs for Infrastructure, FEMA Interim Policy #207 -22-0001 . b. Waivers When necessary, recipients (and subrecipients through their pass -through entity) may apply for, and FEMA may grant, a waiver from these requirements. A waiver of the domestic content procurement preference may be granted by the agency awarding official if FEMA determines that: Applying the domestic content procurement preference would be inconsistent with the public interest. The types of iron, steel, manufactured products, or construction materials are not produced in the United States in suffi cient and reasonably available quantities or of a satisfactory quality. The inclusion of iron, steel, manufactured products, or construction materials produced in the United States will increase the cost of the overall project by more than 25%. 36 FY 2023 EMPG NOFO Back to the Top For FEMA a wards, the process for requesting a waiver from the Buy America preference requirements can be found on FEMA's website at: \"Buy America\" Preference in FEMA Financial Assistance Program s for Infrastructure | FEMA.gov . c.
