As an entity of the State of New York, Stony Brook University Hospital is not re quired to provide such a report. As an expressio n of its commitment to the 1.5 million residents of Suffolk County, the hospital has decided to create a CSP for the benefit of the community . This document represents Stony Brook University Hospital's Community Service Plan. It is the result of a collection of data from a variety of sources, including community partners such as the American Cancer Society and the Suffolk County Department of Health. The CSP is a refle ction of Stony Brook Medicine 's mission to improve the lives of our community and vision to be a world class academic medical center. Background and Overview Stony Brook University Hospital (SBUH ), a major academic medical center, serves the healthcare needs of Long Island as the region's only tertiary care center and Level 1 Trauma Center. SBUH is a stroke center, the region's only academic medical center, regional perinatal center, AIDS center, and burn center . Founded in 1980, the hospital is located 60 miles east of New York City and has 603 certified beds. In 2012 , SBUH discharged 31,964 patients (excluding newbor ns), treated 96,021 patients in the Emergency Department, and served 225,793 outpatients. As a premier academic medical center, Stony Brook Medicine is responsible for healing the sick, educating skilled healthcare professionals, uncovering the complexiti es of disease and discovering new treatments, and reaching out to the community to inform and teach. The hospital fully embrace s patient and family centered care, and consider s its patients and families to be integral members of the healthcare team. Suffolk County Demographicsi Current Statistics In 2013 , the Suffolk County population is estimated at 1.5 million residents and 502,887 households. The population is 51 percent female and 49 percent male. The 18 -44 year age group makes up the larges t subset of the population at 33 percent. The County's ethnicity profi le is: 69.9 percent White Non -Hispanic, 17 percent Hispanic, 6.9 percent Black Non -Hispanic and 3.6 percent Asian Non -Hispanic. All other ethnic categories comprise 1.3 percent or less of the total population. An analysis of Suffolk County's discharges by financial class indicates that 70.3 percent of discharges were Private Direct, ESI, or Exchange, 14.5 percent Medicare and Medicaid dual eligible, 11 percent Medicaid , and 4.1 percent u ninsured. The Suffolk County resident med ian household income is $82,557 . Demographic Projections Between 2013 and 2018 , we project that the Coun ty's population will grow by 1.3 percent to 1,517,063 people, wi th the greatest growth in the age 45 -64 and 65+ cohorts. The number of households within Suffolk County is also projected to grow by 1.6 percent during the same time period.

Stony Brook University Hospital Community Service Plan 2013 -2017 Page 4 of 19 II. Service A rea A. Hospital Service Area As the only tertiary care provider and academic medical center serving Suffolk County, Stony Brook Medicine 's leadership broadly considers Suffolk County to be the hospital's service area, particularly with regard to planning the provision of tertiary care services and related public health education/outreach activities. Rev iew of countywide health services demand and utilization data is therefore central to the development of Stony Brook's community service plan. SBUH also considers the demand for services within its Primary Service Area, defined as the geographic source of the top 50 percent of its inpatient discharges. This service area is particularly relevant to non -tertiary service -related public health education activities. B. Description of Service Area SBUH defines its primary market area as the top zip codes that account for half of the hosp ital's inpatient discharges. Stony Brook University Hospital Community Service Plan 2013 -2017 Page 5 of 19 III. Public Participation A. Participants The voice of our constituents plays an important role in the activ ities of Stony Brook Medicine . In 2013 , more than 300 Suffolk County community based organizations were surveyed electronically as well as on paper about a variety of health topics that impact their constituents . The survey queried respondents on their perception of the biggest health issues impacting the ir community, screenings and services needed, health issues needing education, sources of health information, and the health of their community. This survey had broad, county -wide participation and had a response rate of 35%. Additional quantitative data was gathered from a variety of sources, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), New York State Department of Health, Statewide Planning and Research System (SPARCS), and the Suffolk County Department of Health. The Nassau Suffolk Hospital Council facilitated a population health work group (Workgroup) which consists of representatives from each hospital in Suffolk County as well as the local health department. The Workgroup designed and implemented the survey . Stony Brook University's Public Health Program evaluated the data. B. Meeting Dates The Workgroup met 10/29/13 to discuss outcomes of the survey, review the NYS Prevention Agenda 2017 priorities and indicators, and strategize how the region was going to select priority areas and meet the needs of the region. Barriers that prevent Suffolk County residents from getting their healthcare needs met include the la ck of a reliable public transportation system; lack of affordable housing; improper utilization of emergency departments; cultural differences with regards to perception of cigarette smoking; lack of resources; and a dramatic increase in individuals with l imited English proficiency. C. Public Notification A variety of community -based organizations , including the Asthma Coalition of LI, Cornell Cooperative Extension, Western Suffolk BOCES and the YMCA , as well as Stony Brook University experts , were invited by the Workgroup to assess the data and present their recommendations. Stony Brook University Hospital Community Service Plan 2013 -2017 Page 6 of 19 IV. Assessment and Selection of Public Health Priorities A. Criteria of Public Health Priorities In 2013 , more than 300 Suffolk County community based organizations were surveyed electronically and on paper about a variety of health topics that impact their constituents . The survey queried respondents on their perception of the biggest health issues impacting their community, screenings and services needed, health issues needing education, sources of health information, and the health of their community. This survey had b road, county - wide participation and had a response rate of 35%. Additional quantitative data was gathered from a variety of sources, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), New York St ate Department of Health, Statewide Planning and Research System (SPARCS), and the Suffolk County Department of Health. A variety of community -based organizations , including the Asthma Coalition of LI, Cornell Cooperative Extension, Western Suffolk BOCES and the YMCA , as well as Stony Brook University experts , were invited by the Workgroup to assess the data and present their recommendations. The met outcom es of the survey, review the NYS Prevention Agenda 2017 priorities and indicators, and strategize how the region was going to select priority areas and meet the needs of the region. Stony Brook University Hospital is an active member of the Population H ealth Workgroup. The group consists of representative s from each hospital/hospital system in Suffolk County as well as the Suffolk County Department of Health . This group has been charged with identifying two community health priorities for Suffolk Count y and overseeing the development of action plans to address these priorities. Through monthly meeting discussions with leadership from the SCDOH , area hospitals , community -based organizations, and a thor ough review of the NYSDOH's Prevention Agenda 2013 -2017 indicators and Suffolk County's performance relative to those indicators, the group has selected the following two focus areas from the chronic disease prevention priorities: Reduce obesity in children and adults Increase access to high -quality chronic disease preventive care and management in both clinical and community settings Stony Brook University Hospital Community Service Plan 2013 -2017 Page 7 of 19 Selected Prevention Agenda Priorities For sev eral of the chronic disease and health disparities indicators, Suffolk County's results are worse than the NYS 2017 Obje ctive. These include: Indicator NYS 2017 Objective Suffolk County Percentage of children and adolescents who are obese 16.7 17.5 Age-adjusted heart attack hospitalization rate per 10,000 population 14.0 19.2 Age-adjusted preventable hospitalizations rate per 10,000 - ages 18+ years (ratio of Hispanics to White non-Hispanics) 133.3 (1.38) 148.5 (1.69) Reducing obesity in children and adults was selected as a priority since Suffolk County has a higher perce ntage of obese children and adults (17.5 %) than is proposed as the NYS 2017 Objective (16.7 %). Because obesity is also associated with increased incidenc e of many chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes and some cancers , members of the Population Health Workgroup agreed that decreasing obesity must be one of the c ounty's Prevention Agenda priorities . To develop countywide plans addressing the two Prevention Agenda issues, the Workgroup members have identified clinical and administrative leadership from participant hospital s as well as leadership from regional community -based organizations . Action plans and measurements for tracking progress against each Focus Area's goals are being developed . The second priority area is to \"increase access to high quality chronic disease preventive care and management in both clinical and community settings.\" Areas of focus for S tony Brook are asthma , diabetes, and hypertension. Suffolk County's age -adjusted h eart attack hospitalization rate is 19.2 per 10,000 , while the NYS 2017 Objective is 14.0 per 10,000 . Additionally, according to the most recent data available from SPARCS, 2,546 discharges in Suffolk County had a primary diagnosis of Diabetes in 2011. Approximately fifty percent (50.2 %) of those discharges were from 16 zip codes. Additionally, 33,855 discharges were cardiac (cardiology, open heart and vascular surgery). O f the cardiac discharges, approximately 51% (50.7%) were from 20 zip codes. CVD is a major complication of diabetes and the leading cause of early death among people with diabetes \u2014about 65 percent of people with diabetes die from heart disease and stroke. Adults with diabetes are two to four times more likely to have heart disease or suffer a stroke than people without diabetes.1 Utilizing SPARCS and Prevention Quality Indicators (PQIs) data, we have identified 23 zip codes in Suffolk County that accou nt for approximately 53 % of total discharges for d iabetes, cardiology, open heart and vascular surgery. Of the se zip codes, 30 % have higher than expected hospital admission rates for dia betes, circulatory, respiratory and acute conditions. These zip code s also have high concentrations of Black and/or Hispanic residents. 1 National Diabetes Education Program, http://www.ndep.nih.gov/media/CVD_FactSheet.pdf Stony Brook University Hospital Community Service Plan 2013 -2017 Page 8 of 19 Stony Brook Medicine's leadership also reviewed Suffolk County's performance against NYSDOH's 2017 Objectives related to injury prevention, healthy women, infants, and children, and he alth care related infections. For many of the indicators for the NYS 2017 Objectives , Suffolk County's results are worse than the state averages and more importantly , worse than the 2017 Prevention Agenda target s as indicated below: Indicator NYS 2017 Objective Suffolk County Percentage of cigarette smoking among adults 15.0 17.5 Rate of emergency department visits due to falls per 10,000 - Ages 1 -4 years 429.1 524.2 Rate of hospitalization due to falls per 10,000 - Ages 65+ 204.6 230.2 Percentage of pre -term births 10.2 12.0 Percentage of infants exclusively breastfed in the hospital 48.1 41.4 Percentage of third -grade children with evidence of untreated tooth decay 21.6 29.6 Rate of occupational injuries treated in ED per 10,000 adolescents - Ages 15 -19 years 33.0 48.2 Age-adjusted percentage of adults with poor mental health for 14 or more days in the last month 10.1 13.1 As an institution committed to improving the health of the community we serve and increasing access to care, SBUH has numerous initiatives related to addressing additional Prevention Agenda focus ar eas/goals namely : 1. Reduce illness, disability and death related to tobacco use and seco ndhand smoke exposure; 2. Reduce fall risks among t he most vulnerable populations 3. Promot e maternal and infant health 4. Reduce the prevalence of dental caries am ong NYS children 5. Reduce healthcare -associated infections. Stony Brook University Hospital Community Service Plan 2013 -2017 Page 9 of 19 V. Three year Plan of Action Serving the community is part of the culture at Stony Brook, and we are committed to helping individuals and organizations access health care services. Obesity/weight loss, diabetes, and heart disease/stroke were the top health concerns of responders in bo th surveys . By partnering with community -based organizations , we strive to improve the health status of the community. Through health information and health promotion/disease prevention lectures, workshops and screenings , we enable people to live healthi er lives. The institution will continu e to collaborate with community -based organizations to collectively address health disparities in Suffolk County. Partners in this effort include the Suffolk County Department of Health Services Office of Minority Health and the Latino Health Initiative of Suffolk County. Moreover, the Health Occupations Partnership for Excellence ( HOPE) program works with adolescents to diversify the future healthcare workforce. HOPE reaches directly into the region's underserved communities to identify health issues of importance and to set up mechan isms to address health care disparities. HOPE educates secondary school students in grades 11 -12 from diverse s chool districts throughout the county about healthcare careers, supports their academic achievement and college entry, and raises their awarenes s of the issues that affect their own health and that of their communities. Students are provided education about healt h careers, SAT exam preparation and mentors. Stony Brook's health care professionals will continue to provide a wide variety of free scre enings at health fairs and community events throughout Suffolk Count y. Blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose screenings often reveal the early warning signs of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. We also pro vide free lectures/talks on more than 100 dif ferent topics, free screenings for a variety of ailments such as prostate cancer, oral cancer, vascular disease, and skin cancer. Other outreach to the community includes support groups, and annual events such as the Kids Health & Safety Expo , which raise s awareness about health issues such as injury prevention in children , and the Women's Health Day , which raises awareness about health issues affecting women such as cardiovasc ular disease, diabetes, obesity and cancer.
