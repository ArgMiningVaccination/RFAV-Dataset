Australia is facing greater climate change impacts than many other parts of the world. Like all countries, Australia's health system confronts the dual challenge of dealing with human impacts of climate change and reducing its own substantial contributions to the country's carbon footprint. This report, commissioned by The Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP), is designed to provide Australia's peak healthcare organisations with evidence-based recommendations for Australian policymakers, health systems, health professionals and the communities they serve. The report comprises four research projects undertaken by Monash Sustainable Development Institute (MSDI), the Climate and Health Alliance (CAHA), Monash University's School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine and the University of Melbourne's School of Population and Global Health: A systematic literature review identified 17 reviews of health system response to climate change, finding high-quality evidence of interventions (including energy efficiency measures, waste reduction, reusable textiles, and changes to anaesthetic and surgical practices) that can reduce carbon footprint, save money and improve healthcare outcomes. However, system-level responses are lacking; policy and regulatory support is required; and more research is required, both into effective responses and how to implement these in policy and practice. A policy and institutional analysis (PIA) found that despite a lack of policy drivers, there are strong signs of emerging leadership on climate action at health service, network and state / territory government levels. Progress is strongest in jurisdictions where supporting legislative and regulatory environments provide an authorising environment. Individual-level leadership is also in evidence where strong leadership, support and encouragement are present. The COVID-19 pandemic has illuminated the feasibility of the rapid, system-level change required to tackle the climate health challenge. However, a clear need was identified across all health professions for capacity building regarding the climate change and health nexus and how to communicate and advocate based on this knowledge. A series of case studies representing a broad array of geographical regions, climate risks / opportunities, sectors, and communities (including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people), and sectors provided a human face to the other project findings. Severe impacts to the healthcare system from drought, bushfires, extreme heat, coastal inundation and other climate-related extreme events have already been felt across Australia. These powerful stories of climate-related impacts on healthcare infrastructure, operations, workforce, and service demand bring into sharp relief the human costs to the general community, including the impacts on the healthcare workforce. An economic analysis calculated the losses associated with bushfires between 2021 and 2030 inclusive, based on estimates of bushfire risk relative to the severity of the 2019 Black Summer bushfires over the coming decade. The modelled analysis predicted the loss of 1480 lives; healthcare costs of $69 million; and a $10 billion reduction in gross domestic product. This modelling shows that $1 billion invested to reduce the impact of bushfires on health by 10% would be recouped in a decade. From these four projects emerge a series of key themes which underpin seven recommendations drawn from this program of research. Recommendations 1 Implement and fund a coordinated national strategy on climate change and health \u008fEnable a systems approach to action and decision-making within and across all relevant policy portfolios. \u008fFoster strong collaboration between all levels of government, health institutions, medical colleges, professional associations, industry and civil society. \u008fEncourage community consultation and engagement on the strategy which draws on diverse knowledges including from rural and remote communities. 2 Commit to delivering net zero healthcare by 2040 \u008fDevelop a plan informed by research, evidence and action including from the National Health Service (NHS) in England, World Health Organization (WHO) and Health Care Without Harm. \u008fEnsure that the plan encompasses 5-yearly goals. 3 Invest in climate health vulnerability and capacity assessments with a focus on locally-led planning \u008fSupport all healthcare systems to undertake vulnerability and capacity assessments (VCAs), including in rural and remote communities. \u008fEmbed VCAs within healthcare system management, accreditation standards and performance measures.4 Establish a dedicated climate health resilience research fund to support innovation and evidence-based action \u008fDirect research funding to (i) vulnerability and capacity assessments (VCAs) to manage risks to human health including from extreme weather events; (ii) evaluation of climate health interventions; and (iii) implementation research evaluating translation of evidence-based interventions into policy and practice. \u008fConnect research and innovation efforts through communities of practice that share knowledge and translate effective strategies at scale. 5 Develop climate health capacity in the healthcare workforce and the wider health system \u008fEquip health professionals with climate health information, training and resources. \u008fIntegrate education about climate change and health into all health professional training degrees and Continuing Professional Development. 6 Embed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledge and leadership in all climate health policy and action \u008fRecognise the unique wisdom of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and communities when developing health system and societal policy responses to climate change. \u008fSupport a culturally safe and holistic community- led approach to building climate health resilience. 7 Invest in prevention and early intervention as a key element of climate health action \u008fFocus on preventive population-level measures to support health system resilience. \u008fEliminate unnecessary healthcare to reduce financial and environmental costs and avoid waste. 6 RECommEnDAtions 7PRojEC t sUmm ARy 7The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is very clear: climate change is widespread, rapid, and intensifying, with \"unprecedented\" effects seen around Australia and planetwide.1 Introduction Without a swift and deep reduction in fossil fuel and other greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero, the Paris Agreement's 1.5-2\u00b0C guardrail will slip out of reach, straining society's efforts to adapt. The report's headline \u2014 'Code Red for Humanity' \u2014 succinctly conveys the threat and the urgency for action.1 Similarly, a recent update to a paper originally signed by over 11,000 scientists from 153 countries reported that 18 of 31 'planetary vital signs' indicate very troubling trends, along with little progress by humanity to address climate change.' The scientists \" reaffirm the climate emergency declaration and again call for transformative change, which is needed now more than ever to protect life on Earth and remain within as many planetary boundaries as possible \".2 Australia faces greater climate change impacts than many other parts of the world. Already, Australia and the world are, on average, more than 1\u00b0C hotter than last century.3 On our present course, the world is expected to warm by 1.5\u00b0C in about 20 years.4 Modelling predicts that unless strong action is taken, Australia faces up to 6 degrees mean annual temperature increase since the preindustrial era by 2100.5 This is an unthinkable outcome given that even half of this \u2014 a 3-degree rise \u2014 would render Australia's ecological systems unrecognisable due to alterations in the distribution or loss of thousands of species.6 At 2\u00b0C of global warming, heat extremes would more often breach critical thresholds for food production and human health. Each additional fraction of a degree raises climate-related health risks, including the risk of complex, compound, and cascading impacts.7-9 To avoid the worst health impacts of climate change, global emissions must halve by 2030; reaching net zero by 2050.10 With clearer evidence of climate change countries are signalling stronger climate ambition. The US recently pledged to cut emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030, putting it on track to net zero by 2050. Japan, Canada, the UK, the EU, Project Summary8PRojEC t sUmm ARy and South Korea have also strengthened their targets and other commitments, and the G7 has agreed to stop funding new fossil fuel projects.11 Most countries \u2014 representing over two-thirds of global GDP and 72% of global emissions \u2014 now have some form of net zero emissions target.12 If they match rhetoric with action, the world is projected to warm 2.0-2.4 \u00b0C by 2100. Stronger action is still needed, but the goal agreed to in Paris is within reach.13 Australians' support for strong climate leadership is growing and widening.14 Most expect the federal government to at least match the ambition of the UK, US, and others. Although Australia recently committed to a net zero by 2050 target, Australia is widely seen as a climate laggard;15 with inaction contributing to the erosion of our diplomatic credentials.16 Pacific island states17 and the United States18 have recently taken Australia to task, and Australia ranks last for carbon and energy policy in the 2021 Sustainable Development Report.19 Yet, Australia is 'uniquely placed to benefit economically from global decarbonisation', according to the OECD, with abundant renewable resources. We are, however, especially vulnerable to economic shocks and weather events in a world that is both warming and decarbonising.20,21 Not only have we missed opportunities for the lack of \"a coherent and coordinated national strategy\" and quicker action, but we are now obliged to take a steeper emissions path to get to net zero by 2050.22 Carbon is about to be priced into trade, unnerving Australia's carbon- intensive export industries. The EU will phase in a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) in 2023-26, and the US and China appear to be giving carbon tariffs serious thought.23 Paradoxically, health systems are part of both the problem and the solution.24-26 Australia's health system contributes approximately 7% of the nation's CO2 emissions27 \u2014 an emissions output equivalent to the whole of South Australia.28 Australia's healthcare emissions compare with a global figure of 4.4%29 with figures of 6% and 10% in the UK and US respectively.27 Health systems are also the main line of defence for populations facing health threats resulting from the impacts of climate change including increased temperatures and climate-related extreme weather events \u2014 meaning that health systems are uniquely placed as part of both the problem of climate change but also responsible for managing its health consequences. In recognition of this, the World Health Organization's Special Report for COP26 provides an overview of the health impacts of climate change; outlines the health co-benefits of taking climate action; and makes 10 high-level recommendations for action.30 9PRojEC t sUmm ARy Internationally therefore, the spotlight is on the climate health nexus, with health included in the program of the global climate negotiations in Glasgow, and a COP26 Health Initiative launched by the World Health Organization, the UK COP26 Presidency and international NGO Health Care Without Harm. This initiative calls on health ministries around the world to make commitments to act on climate change through two pathways: building adaptation and resilience; and setting a course for low carbon and sustainable healthcare. England's NHS became the first national health agency to commit to net zero by 2050.30,31 France now requires hospitals to report and reduce their emissions, and Argentina is the first to declare its intention to decarbonize health in its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Australia's NDC, meanwhile, makes no mention of health.33 Australia has however joined the Adaptation Action Coalition.22,34 Under the leadership of President Biden, the US has set in motion a government-wide program of adaptation and mitigation, establishing high-level interagency groups, mainstreaming climate risk management across the financial system, and deploying the purchasing and diplomatic powers of the US government to drive climate action at home and abroad.35 Twenty federal departments and agencies \u2014 including Health and Human Services (HHS) \u2014 now have Climate Action Plans,36 and agency heads are instructed to begin to remove fossil fuel subsidies.37,38 The HHS Secretary has set up a new Office of Climate Change and Health Equity, established a Healthcare System Readiness Advisory Council and an Interagency Working Group to reduce risks to vulnerable Americans. A 2016 National Climate Vulnerability Assessment39 is being updated using the Center for Disease Control's (CDC) long standing Building Resilience Against Climate Effects (BRACE) Framework. These initiatives provide both inspiration and practical guidance for Australia. COP26 Health Initiative calls on health ministries around the world to make commitments to act on climate change through two pathways: building adaptation and resilience; and setting a course for low carbon and sustainable healthcare.10PRojEC t sUmm ARy provide the enabling conditions for action at healthcare service levels, both at the individual institution level and in aggregated healthcare networks. The evidence from the PIA notes that despite the lack of policy drivers, there are strong signs of emerging leadership at a local level, at individual health services and their respective networks. Examples of such leadership include developing programs for staff engagement and preparing climate response plans. Evidence of change also exists at an individual staff level \u2014 for example in instances where healthcare professionals have developed a sense of agency and responsibility in relation to their own role in responding to the health impacts of climate change. This can, in turn, support wider institutional change and build momentum for action. Project findings The four strands of research conducted in this project identified seven interlinked and overarching themes, presented and discussed below. Leadership Leadership \u2014 at the individual, civil society, healthcare sector, and political levels \u2014 is essential for acceleration of action to ensure a climate resilient and environmentally sustainable healthcare system Strong emission reduction targets set by the Commonwealth are a fundamental precursor to enable swift progress to climate resilient and environmentally sustainable healthcare systems, as identified in the literature review and PIA. This leadership can then Four strands of research in this project A rapid systematic review of how health systems around the world are responding to the threat of climate change. An economic analysis estimating the health burden of bushfires in Australia from 2021 to 2030 and the cost- effectiveness of interventions to reduce this burdenA series of case studies representing a broad array of geographical regions, climate risks / opportunities, groups (including Indigenous), and sectors.A policy and institutional analysis to help The RACP understand the lie of the land of climate and health policymaking in Australia, with a view to reforms that reduce climate risks to the health system and help to realise the opportunities. 11PRojEC t sUmm ARy R esponses require collaboration and systems-based approaches A nationally coordinated approach is needed to ensure appropriate responses to climate change across all jurisdictions. As identified in the review, higher impact will be reached with coordinated systems-based action, and the case studies illustrate the risks of a fragmented approach. Numerous agencies, regulators and advisory bodies exist at Commonwealth and state levels. Some have an explicit remit to address climate change, while others have considerable untapped potential if their functions are connected to climate change adaptation goals. However even if complex, multilayered health systems and colleges act in a coordinated fashion and lead mitigation and adaptation initiatives, they will ultimately be limited unless these initiatives are enabled by sectors outside of healthcare, for example energy and transport. Colleges and other healthcare actors will need to work with others, not just other health disciplines but across interdisciplinary and systems boundaries. It is likely that these other sectors are in turn dependent on health as a high carbon emitter to amplify and facilitate their efforts. Although such analysis is beyond the scope of this report, cross-sectoral efforts are the ultimate means of getting richer, stronger, outcomes that are better for everyone and more applicable to the real world and people on the ground. Sharing experiences and lessons learnt is a crucial vehicle to encourage and implement 'Communities of Practice', which as the literature review shows, can accelerate widespread uptake and lead to innovative ideas and synergistic efforts. Similarly, the case studies indicate that when interested clinicians or service providers find exemplars that illustrate what is possible, they can be inspired to implement similar or even greater efforts. This is supported by behavioural and implementation science literature which is also described in the literature review. The power of the enabling environment created through legislation is highlighted in Victoria's Climate Change Act 2017 , which obliges the development of sectoral mitigation and adaptation plans.40 Numerous other policies, strategies and efforts of individuals, hospitals, government bodies and clinicians are identified. However, collective action is missing due to the fragmented nature of the health system and lack of national leadership. This means that responses to climate change are piecemeal and at times inadequate. For example, the Case Study on the South Coast NSW bushfires reports that lack of engagement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in disaster response planning led to \"poor, culturally unsafe services being provided by some mainstream services and charities during the bushfires.\" The importance of the policy and regulation environment was echoed in the literature review, noting that policy and regulatory barriers to health system responses to climate change need to be addressed. Centralised regulation and guidance, community pressure and healthcare calls for action are important facilitators of policy and regulatory support41-44 \u2014 many such calls for action were noted in the literature review. However, substantial barriers exist including lack of or inadequate regulations;27,45 the need to shift manufacturing, transport and procurement practices;46 lack of policy coherence;47 and lack of political leadership.48 The health sector can lead calls for greater action on climate change at all levels of government, as noted by the Paris Agreement (2015).13 As indicated in the case studies and a national survey undertaken by the Climate and Health Alliance49 health practitioners are calling for information and support to help empower communities to develop and implement the necessary adaptation and mitigation strategies to respond to climate change. Collective action is missing due to the fragmented nature of the health system and lack of national leadership.12PRojEC t sUmm ARy The case studies also provide clear evidence on how climate change is impacting Australians and the health system they rely on. Drought, bushfires, extreme heat, coastal inundation and other climate-related events can result in a dangerous combination of increased healthcare demand and reduced healthcare capacity. These impacts are not just physical \u2014 the case studies reveal mental health challenges, including for providers of healthcare. The literature review identified that mental health services are effective in dealing with mental health problems following acute climate- related events; however for sub-acute and longer term mental health impacts efforts directed at advocacy for mitigation policies and programs are also needed. There is evidence of fertile ground on which to build meaningful action on climate change. An illustrative example spanning all research projects within this report is harnessing solar energy. The PIA describes Queensland's $30 million initiative to install solar panels at 50 sites; the Case Study of Victoria's response to climate change describes the Regional Solar Health Program, which will reduce carbon emissions in public health facilities by 13,000 tonnes annually. The review by Barraclough (2020) cites five individual research studies examining the impact of solar power on reducing power consumption.41 Renewable energy will feature in Hunter New England Health Service's effort to become carbon neutral by 2030, ironically despite its location in Australia's most carbon intensive region, the Hunter Valley in NSW. A discussion of the cost of action should also consider the cost of inaction. The economic analysis within this project calculated the losses associated with bushfires between 2021 and 2030 inclusive, based on estimates of bushfire risk relative to the severity of the 2019 Black Summer bushfires over the coming decade. The modelled analysis predicted loss of 1480 lives, equating to 4024 years of life; healthcare costs of $69 million; and a $10 billion impact on gross domestic product. This model shows that $1 billion invested to reduce the impact of bushfires on health by 10% would be recouped in a decade. The literature review identified few published studies at a system- or country- level. Given the scale of the climate change challenge, system- and country-level responses offer the most potential for significant impact.50,51 The example of the NHS reforms in the UK, described in the PIA, powerfully illustrates the potential of system-level responses to amplify the interventions that were identified in the literature review. E vidence-based action is a fundamental principle for the healthcare sector. Healthcare professions and their peak bodies are driven first and foremost by their motivation to provide best evidence-based care to their patients. Australia's medical colleges have the reputation, resources and power to lead and influence. The NHS has over the last decade provided a blueprint for how health systems can spend less money, reduce their carbon footprint and improve patient care. The catalyst for this was strong national leadership on emissions reduction, and this should be a key focus of advocacy for the colleges. Responses to the impact of climate change on the health sector are best informed by the conduct of vulnerability and capacity assessments (VCAs), which will guide evidence-based actions. The WHO provides guidelines for the conduct of such assessments, which have been carried out globally.30 The UK NHS also offer numerous resources pertaining to both assessment and system-wide action. The literature review and PIA both identify a need for a more comprehensive assessment of health system vulnerability to climate change including economic evaluation of risks and costs of inaction as well as savings from climate mitigation and adaptation measures. Currently there is insufficient funding for research to conduct such assessments. In addition, the case studies highlight a lack of coordinated investment in assessing climate health risks to specific populations and to health services, and insufficient evaluation of programs being delivered.13PRojEC t sUmm ARy Capacity development Capacity development of the healthcare sector, the health workforce and the wider health system can enhance understanding and action on health and climate change. There is a need for health professionals to be equipped with information, tools and resources to support them to anticipate, prepare for and respond to the health impacts of climate change. Specifically, the literature review found a need for more implementation studies, which, if available, can then be used to support training on appropriate interventions. The literature review did identify that training of healthcare workers to improve environmental performance of hospitals which reduces chemical use, waste disposal and surgical costs was a beneficial intervention. A significant gap in relation to awareness of emerging policies, tools and resources was identified in the case studies, and the PIA reinforces the need for education and information for health professionals on the relationship between climate change and human health, and the role of health professionals in responding to the impacts. The PIA also reveals the deep concern of engaged health professionals regarding the failure of policy to keep pace with the evidence regarding climate change and adverse health impacts (physical, mental, emotional, financial) on the population and on the health system in Australia. Whilst this concern is a clear issue, there is also an opportunity to collaborate with this segment of engaged health professionals to develop their capacity to continue their efforts to support system changes. C lear accountability frameworks will facilitate a rapid learning healthcare system. Clear, practical and appropriate Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) frameworks are required in order for the healthcare system to continually adapt and improve its sustainability efforts. Currently, there is insufficient attention on capturing lessons focused on what works and what doesn't, and ways to share knowledge. The case studies illustrate the variety of approaches that are showing promise across the nation. Resources to support the monitoring, evaluation and learning of these interventions can accelerate the adoption of these in other locations, notwithstanding the importance of context specific interventions. Innovative ideas can be trialled that support collaboration and help embed sustainable approaches. Responding to climate change also requires strategic imagination to transform a system that is traditionally reactive to one that is proactive and focused on the delivery of high-value, net zero emissions and sustainable healthcare. The literature review finds that more research into effectiveness (rather than observational studies and commentaries) is needed, particularly relating to environmental impact assessments including life cycle analysis and economic evaluations of Returns on Investment (RoI). These types of applied research activities have clear value for articulating the business case for investing in climate resilient and environmentally sustainable healthcare systems. 14PRojEC t sUmm ARy 14As noted in the case studies, equally important is the role of health professionals to help empower communities to make the necessary adaptive and mitigative changes to respond to climate change. Health practitioners want information and support to be able to do this. There is much to be learned from the leaders in this area \u2014 particularly the UK's Greener NHS which provides consistent, evidence-based and health system-wide guidance. While these strategies and resources provide a useful starting resource, they may need to be adapted for the Australian context. The rapid growth in Australian and Aotearoa New Zealand (AoNZ) membership of Global Green and Healthy Hospitals indicates keen interest and appetite for authentic, credible peer support, information and guidance. D iverse knowledge Harnessing diverse knowledges across different contexts will yield appropriate and context- specific responses. There is no 'one-size fits all' response to the impacts of climate change on the healthcare sector. Developing appropriate responses requires the inclusion of diverse voices and knowledges. As highlighted in the case studies, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voices need to be clearly heard and should be central in the development of plans to guide climate preparedness, as well as disaster and emergency response affecting their communities. They should have access to community- driven, culturally safe, and properly resourced responses to disasters and equally to resilience building and preparedness for future impacts. Indigenous- and community-led or co-led approaches that embrace all sectors are vital and promising approaches. Similarly, in rural and regional settings, consultation with local stakeholders including those within the health system should be part of climate change responses as well as disaster preparedness and planning. The literature review reveals little evidence of recognition of the importance of Indigenous perspectives or cultural safety in the literature, despite the case studies highlighting the importance of cultural safety and valuing Indigenous knowledge systems. They confirm many health professionals are aware of failing to overcome persisting barriers to equitable health outcomes, conscious of heavier burdens carried by Indigenous health workers, and are unsure of how to learn from First Nations people. In addition, the PIA identifies the emergence of an overdue but wider recognition about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and groups as custodians of valuable knowledge developed over millennia that can inform and guide policy and practice in relation to climate change and health risks and opportunities. P revention as a key tenet Key principles of optimal healthcare \u2014 prevention, early intervention and reduction of low-value / non-evidence- based care \u2014 are highly congruent with the climate change agenda. Upstream action on climate change \u2014 particularly mitigation in Australia's context \u2014 will prevent burdens on the healthcare system and support its resilience. The literature review clearly identifies the range of low-emission healthcare alternatives that can reduce costs and improve health system resilience. The focus on prevention is reinforced in the case studies, which highlight that many health professionals, particularly non- metropolitan practitioners, feel exhausted by cascading and compounding stressors including droughts, fires, floods, and COVID-19. They recognise that proactive, capacity building, preventive, often population-level approaches are essential to build community resilience and address current and future healthcare needs. Further, the PIA demonstrates a recognition that desirable, rapid system change is possible in the face of serious threat and the COVID-19 recovery presents an opportunity that should not be wasted, to build back better for climate resilient and environmentally sustainable healthcare. This is reflected by international calls to draw upon lessons learned from COVID-19 to improve the resilience of health and social care systems.52 The economic analysis summarised above further underlines the value of prevention in financial terms.

A total of 34 health system responses were identified spanning interventions in operating rooms (n = 16), dialysis and respiratory medicine settings, at hospital- level and in community settings. Evidence from higher quality reviews reports a broad range of beneficial interventions including: \u008fTraining of healthcare workers to improve environmental performance of hospitals which reduces chemical use, waste disposal and surgical costs; \u008fEnergy efficiency measures which result in water and energy savings calculated in one study to be USD $800 000-$3 million annually; \u008fRecycling in operating rooms, dialysis and across hospitals which generate financial savings and circular economy benefits; \u008fTelemedicine which reduces carbon footprint, hospital referrals and more costly face-to-face consultations; \u008fSubstituting desflurine in anaesthesia for lower- polluting agents, which reduces the greenhouse gas contribution of anaesthetic gases in operating theatres from 51-63% to 4%; \u008fReusing textiles, as high-quality studies have demonstrated that disposable clothing has a 200-300% higher carbon footprint; 250 -300% greater water need and 750% greater impact on solid waste production; and \u008fReprocessing single-use devices which carries annual savings in the US of $471 million and 7,000 tons of medical waste. Given the scale of the climate change challenge, system \u2014 and country- level responses offer the most potential for significant impact.17sUmm ARy Although the above examples demonstrate the potential of at-scale actions, few published studies at a system \u2014 or country \u2014 level were identified. Given the scale of the climate change challenge, system \u2014 and country-level responses offer the most potential for significant impact.50,51 The example of the UK NHS, outlined in the PIA, powerfully illustrates the potential of system-level responses to amplify the strategies outlined above. This documents not only the value of system-level change but the transformative steps required to achieve this.53 Related to this, more research into effectiveness (as opposed to observational studies and commentaries) is needed \u2014 especially environmental impact assessments including life cycle analysis and economic evaluation of return on investment.27,4 4,54 Policy and regulatory barriers to health system responses to climate change need to be addressed. Centralised regulation and guidance, community pressure and healthcare calls for action are important facilitators of policy and regulatory support.41-44 However, substantial barriers exist including lack of or inadequate regulations;27,45 the need to shift manufacturing, transport and procurement practices;46 lack of policy coherence;47 and lack of political leadership.48 In addition to these barriers, individual and organisational-level implementation of effective strategies requires careful consideration of behaviour change and related theories. There is evidence from both reviews and primary studies that can guide communication and implementation strategies, including critical insights into the role of social influences on behaviour that have direct implications for implementation efforts. Future research should therefore strike a balance between discovery research to establish 'what works' in responding to climate change, and implementation research to evaluate effectiveness of strategies promoting meaningful individual- and organisational-level change.Methods The review question co-developed in consultation with The RACP was: \"How are healthcare systems responding to the threat of climate change?\" A rapid literature review ('review of reviews') approach was used to address the review question as this is a recognised approach to gathering key information from research literature in limited timeframes where a full systematic review is not feasible.55 Studies have shown that rapid literature reviews have similar conclusions to systematic reviews of the same topic.56 The review protocol was registered on the global PROSPERO research review database (Registration number: CRD42021260450). A comprehensive literature search was conducted in Medline via Ovid, Global Health via Ovid, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Health Systems Evidence, Social Systems Evidence and Google Scholar on June 11, 2021. The search was restricted to English language and literature published from 2016 onwards. Citation and full text screening were independently undertaken by two reviewers (PB and AL) using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria to reduce selection bias. Inclusion criteria were designed to identify reviews in any country and Australian primary studies. Data extraction was performed by one reviewer (AL) and checked by a second reviewer (PB). Data extracted from relevant reviews included author/s name, date published, number of included studies, date of most recent search, aim, area of focus within the healthcare system (i.e. setting-specific, discipline-specific or general), response to climate change (i.e. intervention- specific or general) and key findings / conclusions. One reviewer performed quality appraisal (LP). 18sUmm ARy The quality of included systematic review was appraised using A Measurement Tool to Assessment Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR 2)57 and the quality of included narrative reviews was appraised using the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles (SANRA).58 Consistent with previous published approaches, studies of higher quality were defined as those meeting half or more of applicable quality assessment criteria.59 Given that Australian and AoNZ primary studies were not the main focus of this review, the quality of these studies was not assessed. Interventions supported by at least one higher quality review and three primary studies were highlighted. Search strategies, inclusion and exclusion criteria are contained in Appendix 1. Results A total of 4409 citations were identified; 165 articles were reviewed in full-text and 17 reviews relevant to the review question were identified. These comprised four systematic reviews43,60-62 (which follow an explicit search, selection and synthesis method) and 13 narrative reviews27,41,4 4-47,54,63-68 (which follow less explicit/robust methods). Eight reviews were of relatively high methodological quality, comprising one systematic review43 and seven narrative reviews44-46,54,63,64,67 and nine were of lower quality. Four primary Australian / AoNZ studies were identified.42,48,69,70 Details of search and screening, and quality appraisal scores for all reviews are contained in Appendix 2. Table 1 presents characteristics of interventions identified in the review that were supported by at least one higher quality review and at least three primary studies. An overview of all interventions across all reviews is contained in Appendix 3.

Given the scale of the climate change challenge, system- and country-level responses offer the most potential for significant impact. For example, Yates et al. reported that reprocessing of single-use devices such as cardiac catheters, laparoscopic staplers and external fixation devices, under regulation of the Food and Drug Administration, offers a safe alternative to new purchases of such items.44 In 2019 over 7,500 participating hospitals contributed to saving USD $544 million; diverting almost 7 million kilograms of waste from landfill; and saving a further USD $21 million in waste disposal charges.50,51 Policy and regulatory support is needed to drive system-level action The example of single-use device reprocessing illustrates the importance of policy and regulatory mechanisms. Facilitators of such strategies highlighted across the included reviews were: \u008fThe US-based National Telehealth Policy Center which state-specific telehealth laws, regulation and guidance;44 \u008fThe likelihood that regulatory and community pressures will compel reductions in carbon usage;42,62 and \u008fA number of healthcare entities and associations calling for action on climate change.43Key Findings Across the Included Reviews22KEy FinDings Many reviews also outlined policy and regulatory barriers and challenges: \u008fThe need for more countries to develop regulations for reprocessing \u2014 the cleaning and packaging of single-use equipment (such as blood pressure cuffs and cardiological catheters) for reuse;27 \u008fLimitations to regulations (health and safety regulations, building codes) preventing hospitals adopting sustainable practices;45 \u008fThe need to shift the health sector's procurement policies \u2014 at present the procurement chain of drugs and devices (methods of manufacture, packaging, transport, energy requirements of drug delivery) accounts for the major part of carbon emissions from healthcare facilities;46 \u008fDiscordance between policies that do not balance individual with planetary risk;47 \u008fThe need for ophthalmologists to advocate for public health policy and the variable level of confidence and skill amongst doctors in doing so;69 \u008fThe need for eHealth policies to incentivise mitigation and adaptation in the healthcare sector;65 \u008fPolicymaker recognition of the value of sustainability in laboratory medicine;66 \u008fConsideration of the political and social aspects of disaster risk reduction as relevant to the provision of mental health services as well as broad climate change policy in health and other sectors;67 and \u008fThe need for leadership, policy and regulation to support climate change adaptation in Queensland's health and wellbeing sector.48 More research into the effectiveness of health system interventions to address climate change is needed \u008fReviews found that opinion pieces, perspectives and commentaries calling for action to address climate change were more frequently found than primary studies evaluating impact of strategies: \u008fThe high-quality and recent systematic review conducted by Dupraz and Burnand contained 137 articles, of which only 22 presented research; these comprised 3 reviews, 12 surveys, 5 qualitative studies and only two studies evaluated effectiveness of strategies to address climate change;43 \u008fThe high-quality narrative review conducted by Guetter et al. contained 37 studies but reported that most were opinion papers, white papers and small case studies and more empirical data is required;64 \u008fA low-quality systematic review by Bali and Flesher found 40 papers for full text review but no papers containing empirical data or impact evaluation.60 23KEy FinDings Specific types of data recommended were environmental impact assessments including life cycle analysis54,71 and economic evaluation of return on investment.44,54 Although a number of primary studies were cited in the included reviews, they were not quality- appraised within the reviews and therefore the strength of this research evidence cannot be established. The volume of primary studies is modest given that at least some will be cited in multiple reviews. Supplementary primary studies The four primary studies from Australia and AoNZ (presented in Appendix 5) illustrate responses in the local context. A survey of 71 dialysis facilities in Victoria reported limited climate change preparedness, with good performance on waste separation but limited efforts to address transport-related emissions or improve procurement processes.42 Another survey of 47 ophthalmologists in AoNZ revealed high awareness of the challenge of climate change, the need to reduce waste, and their public health advocacy role, but limited uptake of sustainability practices and staff awareness-raising activities.69McGain (2016) examined steam steriliser use in a hospital surgery setting, finding that although sterilisers were idle for approximately half of the year, they were only turned off 15% of the time. The researchers calculated that switching off idle sterilisers would save over $13800 and reduce of 80 tonnes of CO2 emissions.70 Finally, Tonmoy (2020) examined an innovative engagement process used to develop climate adaptation policy with the health and wellbeing sector in Queensland. A number of transferable factors contributing to engagement and co-development were identified including adopting a holistic definition of the health and wellbeing sector; focusing on the co-benefits of mitigation and adaptation; ensuring governance, regulatory and reporting mechanisms are clearly understood; long-term and ongoing engagement to ensure effective implementation); use of an interdisciplinary approach through participation of service managers, researchers, clinicians and practitioners; acknowledging diverse challenges among different care settings and tailoring adaptation solutions accordingly.48 24KEy FinDings Discussion This is the first known overview of reviews to systematically identify, appraise and synthesise information about health system responses to climate change from review-level studies. The review identified and appraised 17 reviews of health system responses to climate change. The review found published evidence supporting a range of health system responses to climate change across multiple review and primary studies. This evidence is primarily at the level of individual hospitals, health services or communities; if the reported outcomes were achieved at scale, there is potential for substantial reductions in carbon footprint and costs associated with delivering healthcare. There are few published studies at this system level. Achieving this requires health system- level transformation, requiring strong health system leadership as well as wider policy and regulatory support. Barriers that need to be overcome to achieve this include lack of or limits to existing regulations the need to shift procurement policies and practices; and policy discordance. The review also found that more research is required, especially studies quantifying the effectiveness of climate change action strategies or performing environmental impact / life cycle assessments. This would complement existing evidence on the impact of healthcare on emissions, which broadly mirrors the sectors in which there is most evidence for response strategies \u2014 surgery and anaesthetics in particular \u2014 but also highlights other areas including renal, pathology and asthma inhalers as having substantial carbon footprints.53 This review had a number of strengths. A review protocol was developed a priori in close consultation with experts in the field and pre-registered. A systematic and comprehensive literature review was undertaken to identify review-level evidence pertaining to health systems responses to climate change. Article screening was undertaken by two independent reviewers to reduce bias in study selection. Finally, eligible literature was appraised using recognised quality appraisal tools for systematic and narrative reviews. These methodological strengths mean that a high degree of confidence can be placed in the review findings. However, limitations of the review also warrant mention. The parameters of the project meant that the research team did not undertake dual data extraction and quality appraisal, meaning that these elements may have been subject to some bias. A general limitation of rapid literature reviews is that there is potential overlap between the primary studies included across all systematic reviews. This inflates the apparent volume of primary research covered by the reviews. In this review, the limitation is in part offset by the breadth of climate change responses within the reviews. Finally, there are reviews and grey literature reports that may be relevant but were not identified in searching. We limited the year range to 2016, coinciding with the Paris climate change summit; and many reports and other sources of grey literature are not indexed in academic databases which focus on peer-reviewed studies. However, grey literature was not specifically excluded, and the research team had knowledge of relevant major reports to aid interpretation of the findings of the included reviews. In addition to community pressures, healthcare entities and associations calling for action on climate change is critical to driving health system-level transformation. Recent work by the Climate and Health Alliance (CAHA) explored health professionals' 25KEy FinDings views on climate change through a national survey of 875 people representing a broad range of disciplines. This revealed widespread concern about climate change; observed impacts on health professionals' workplaces; a desire to learn more about health impacts of climate change and a need for training on how to communicate this information to others.49 This reflects findings of a review of this topic72 as well as similar surveys conducted by the American Thoracic Society;73 a major multinational survey of over 4,000 health professionals74 and a survey of over 700 health professionals in China.75 Subsequently CAHA have released a practical guide to aid health professionals,49 building on the few comparable examples in peer- reviewed literature.76 Another key finding of the CAHA survey was the need to receive information from their union or professional organisations to enable them to communicate the value of climate change action. Numerous professional societies and organisations have issues position statements regarding the need for climate change action including the European Respiratory Society;77 the American College of Physicians;78 The Victorian branch of the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation.79 These are reflected by similar calls to action at sectoral levels in community health, general practice and private practice settings;80-83 Middle Income Countries;92 and paediatric intensive care.93,94The ample evidence of calls to action and position statements raises an important question \u2014 what do we know about the effectiveness of advocacy efforts to spark meaningful and impactful action based on the evidence base described in this review? Behavioural psychology and implementation science offer theories and insights that can aid advocacy and implementation efforts. Although beyond the scope of this review, some consideration of implementation and behaviour change challenges is warranted given the urgency of the climate change challenge. 'Winning hearts and minds' at the level of individuals is an important precursor to system-level transformation involving multiple actors. Hathaway and Maibach (2018)72 systematically reviewed literature on how health professionals and the public around the world view the health implications of climate change. The review found evidence that people view climate change as harmful to health but lack knowledge of specific health impacts. Importantly, their conclusion that 'health professionals feel the need to learn more, and the public appears open to learning more' suggests that the door is open to health professionals sharing knowledge and promotion action on this issue. Public sentiment is a key influence on policymakers and has been demonstrated to drive legislative change in a number of areas, for example the introduction of seat belt and other road safety laws.95 Hornsey et al. (2021)97 offer a thought-provoking critique of the reasoning processes that are thought to drive pro-environmental behaviour. The central idea is that beliefs about efficacy to address climate change are a central behavioural driver. There is evidence that five factors underpin perceptions of efficacy \u2014 climate-related distress and threat; social norms (others are taking action therefore I should); social desirability (taking action is an expression of my identity and concerns); difficulty in changing behaviour using explicit instruction; and responsiveness to imagery. Implications of these five factors are discussed and the surprising conclusion is that evidence-based arguments and information are not a reliable influence on perceived efficacy. 'Winning hearts and minds' at the level of individuals is an important precursor to system-level transformation...26KEy FinDings This implies that non-analytic, intuitive and socially normed strategies may be more effective.96 This paper is reflected in part in the review by van Velkengoed (2019) who found in a meta-analysis of 106 studies that descriptive norms, negative affect, perceived self- efficacy (belief that people are capable in engaging in adaptive actions) and outcome efficacy (the extent to which people believe that adaptive actions will be effective in protecting them from climate-related hazards) were most strongly associated with climate change adaptation behaviour. Echoing Hornsey, the authors concluded that knowledge and experience, commonly assumed barriers to adaptation, were less influential than efficacy beliefs.97 A primary study examining the effect of analogies of climate change to more familiar domains found that although analogies did not inform knowledge, there was a weak effect of a medical analogy describing climate change as a disease where readers play the role of the patient's guardian on recognition of the issue, especially amongst conservative voters. Although an isolated study, this has particular resonance with the issue of health professionals communicating climate change.98 When moving from individual to organisational levels, literature dealing with group deliberation and decision-making processes can add further insights to those directed at understanding individuals. Arvai et al. (2012)99 systematically reviewed 60 years of decision-making research on how to balance social, economic and environmental considerations when making sustainability decisions.The review presents models for supporting decision-making based upon this research and uses worked examples to illustrate them in two prototypical decision-making scenarios. Strategies for active decision-making \u2014 high-stakes, complex decisions often involving uncertainty and multiple stakeholders \u2014 are based on breaking decisions down into manageable steps; identifying and avoiding biases arising from 'shortcuts' (heuristics); explicitly addressing consequences and trade-offs; and incorporating subjective values. Conversely, passive decision-making \u2014 where decisions are low-stakes / small and are made at an individual level \u2014 employ different techniques such as goal- setting, 'nudges' and setting defaults that make decisions and actions easier. This framing is useful for considering the transformational challenges identified in this review, which clearly fall into the active / group decision-making space, where acknowledging complexity and incorporating stakeholder values are critical. Another review from the Network for Business Sustainability presents evidence-based approaches to embedding sustainability into organisational culture - although it should be noted that like the review by Arvai, the frameworks and strategies presented are based on literature reviewed at least 10 years ago.100 These behavioural and implementation insights are fertile ground for new research to continue building knowledge not just of 'what works' to address climate change, but what works to implement these strategies through behaviour, cultural and organisational change. However, there is also a need to build the primary evidence base supporting action by health systems. Reviews reported ample opinion, commentary and 'call to action' articles, in many cases substantially outnumbering articles that empirically evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation and adaptation actions. This means that future research needs to address the dual goals of building evidence to support action as well as evidence to support implementation. As with all areas of research, funding is heavily skewed to empirical research when compared with implementation studies. Given the increasing urgency of climate change action and the need to mobilise organisations and populations to commit to meaningful responses, future research funding should strike a balance between discovery and implementation research on this critical issue. Policy and Institutional Analysis SUMMARY AND FINDINGSSummary This section comprises a high-level review of the policy and institutional responses of the health system to climate change: outlining risks, progress, gaps and opportunities to advance climate- smart healthcare. Our analysis draws on a semi-systematic review of (grey and peer-reviewed) literature, and interviews with experts as key informants. It is intended to be exploratory and insightful, but not exhaustive. Further details about the study design and methods are provided in Appendix 6. Climate change affects the health system in many ways, impacting healthcare infrastructure, operations, workforce, and service demand, as described by the case studies section of this report. There are many health gains available by taking action to address climate change with potential for win-win- win outcomes from strategies to reduce emissions, improve health and realise savings. The national response to COVID-19 demonstrates a recognition that desirable, rapid system change is possible in the face of a serious threat. Our economic and social recovery from the pandemic presents an opportunity that should not be wasted: to build back better for value- based, low-emission, climate resilient healthcare. Despite a lack of policy drivers, there are strong signs of emerging leadership across individual health services and networks. This includes developing programs and initiatives for staff engagement, institutional environmental management and climate response plans. Many of these initiatives are delivering (or have the potential to deliver) significant fiscal and public health benefits.Progress is strongest in jurisdictions where there is underlying supporting legislation which creates the enabling conditions for action to occur at service and institutional levels. This authorising environment to support action is a key ingredient in creating the conditions for innovation and action for leadership by institutions and individuals alike. This can be complemented with clear, experience-based, data- supported case studies to communicate the benefits for health service delivery, population health, and environmental and financial gains to influence political, policy and health-system positions and practice. There is also evidence of positive change where the conditions for leadership exist at the level of the individual. Support and empowerment of health professionals to develop a sense of agency and responsibility in relation to their role in responding to the health impacts of climate change can support wider institutional change, and build momentum for action. Examples to guide action are critical here, as are supportive communities of practice, where people can learn, share ideas, and develop confidence to innovate.sUmm ARy 28 There is however evidence of a clear need for education and information for health professionals from all disciplines on the relationship between climate change and health and the role of the health professions in response. Despite some important examples of leadership, there remains a knowledge and awareness gap among the health and medical professions, healthcare service managers and executives, as well as policymakers, about the nexus between climate change and health. This is a gap which must be addressed before we can mount an effective national response.Context As we have seen above, stronger climate action is urgent and imperative. We need climate-smart and ultimately net zero emissions health systems and services, designed to anticipate, respond to, cope with, and recover from climate shocks, so that they can continue to provide safe, quality care for Australian communities.101 And we need to ensure those communities \u2014 especially the most vulnerable \u2014 are themselves as resilient as possible, including by reducing inequity and other root causes of ill-health. Australia's health system is world class, but policymakers and providers face enormous headwinds, including an aging population, a rising incidence of chronic diseases, more complex and costly interventions, and problems recruiting skilled people in the right places.102 Hospitals and health services already struggle to contain mounting costs while maintaining quality, accessibility, and affordability. From 2000 to 2018 total healthcare spending doubled to $185 billion,103 consuming a quarter of combined federal and state government revenue. Very little revenue \u2014 less than 2% \u2014 is invested in prevention, with spending decisions heavily weighted against the long-term health needs of the population.104 At the same time, healthcare is a substantial source of carbon emissions, meaning hospitals and other services are contributing to increasing the climate risks in the very communities they serve. Fortunately, as more and more health policymakers and providers are discovering, lightening health's carbon footprint can also lighten the load on healthcare budgets.105 International evidence and emerging practice in Australia's health sector demonstrates there is enormous potential for substantial transformation of healthcare's climate footprint as well as a strong appetite for exercising this important lever for change. Many resources and examples of best practice now exist to guide action in the healthcare sector to play its part in reducing emissions to help limit the impacts of climate change on the population and health system. There remains a knowledge and awareness gap among health professionals, service managers, executives and policymakers about the nexus between climate change and health.sUmm ARy 29 There is much to be learned from the leaders such as Greener NHS (see Box 1 above), along with other examples of evidence-based health system- wide guidance, including strategies and resources that can be adapted for the Australian context. A Global Roadmap to Health Care Decarbonisation has been developed by global engineering firm, Arup, and international non-government organisation, Health Care Without Harm, which identifies seven high-impact actions across three intersecting pathways which are key to achieving healthcare decarbonisation107. The WHO has developed guidance for climate resilient and environmentally sustainable healthcare facilities (2020),108 and climate vulnerability checklists to support building climate resilience in healthcare facilities (2021).109The rapid growth in Australian and AoNZ membership of Global Green and Healthy Hospitals Network indicates keen interest and appetite in the region for authentic, credible peer support, information and guidance, as well as a strong desire for support for action within the sector towards climate resilient and environmentally sustainable health services. While reducing emissions now is critical to avoid climate change impacts decades into the future, this is not the only driver or rationale for action now. There are local, immediate benefits to health from strategies that reduce emissions, which can be realised much sooner, and underpin the health and economic arguments for action. As The Lancet has identified, \"Tackling climate change could be the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century.\" Box 1. Case study: Greener NHS one of the most notable examples of leadership on climate change from healthcare internationally comes from England's n ational Health s ervice ( nHs). UK g overnment targets for reducing carbon emissions and the formation of a sustainable Development Unit ( sDU) in the nHs has matured into a larger g reener nHs national program. Led by Australian doctor, n ick Watts, g reener nHs's mission is to reach net zero emissions under the direct control of the n Hs by 2040, and across the entirety of emissions by 2045.53 In its first year, Greener NHS grew from 7 staff to 150. over 155 hospital trusts and integrated care systems now have their own local net zero strategies, and all NHS services will have a net zero plan in place by April 2022. From 2026, the NHS will require all suppliers to its \u00a360 billion per annum purchasing of medicines and consumables to have net zero plans in order to secure contracts. Every n Hs trust is shifting to purchasing 100% renewable energy.106 the ambition of the nHs more broadly has emboldened individual health services inspired by the practical illustration of progress in this seemingly complex and challenging area. this serves to underline the importance of case studies and real-world examples in guiding action.sUmm ARy 30 There is substantial evidence that many strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will also result in significant co-benefits to health, if carefully designed. For example, in 2018, The Lancet Planetary Health found that savings from health benefits alone would compensate for the costs of meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement.110 But while there is a good public- health and fiscal case for climate action and for using the health co-benefits to frame political commitments, these are not always apparent to key stakeholders, including key policy actors.111,112 As shown in the literature review, more research is needed to quantify these co-benefits for Australia, to support the business case for action to reduce emissions, and to use these, in addition to knowledge from behaviour change and implementation science, to guide policy so we might realise the savings from avoided ill-health and productivity gains. An analysis of climate & health governance in Australia Policy literature and evidence relating to the impacts of climate change on the health system in Australia reveals considerable variation in the approach across the jurisdictions to addressing the impacts of climate change on the health sector. Most notable is a lack of leadership from the Commonwealth, despite considerable evidence about the risks to health from climate change. Given the scale and severity of climate impacts on health, there has been insufficient effort to assess and quantify the risks to health from climate change by national, state/territory, local governments, as well as at service and clinical level, and a lack of funded research to fill this gap. At the federal level, responses are largely limited to reactive health protection and disaster response. State and territory efforts range from jurisdiction-wide adaptation plans, to departmental-led guidance for hospitals and health services. These include emerging tools for climate risk assessment, support for greener healthcare buildings, adoption of renewable energy, waste management programs, and guidance for agencies on tackling climate change in the context of public health and wellbeing. Many local governments and community health agencies are developing programs to address the health impacts of climate change in their communities, but much more is required. Australia's climate health performance in an international context Australian healthcare stakeholders, together with the international climate and health community, have been calling for all nations to prioritise health in the context of their national climate change response since 2011.113 As a signatory to the Paris Agreement, Australia now has international obligations to consider health in the context of its national climate change response. This Agreement was a historic win for public health, as the WHO declared in 2015: \"The world now has a climate treaty that will become a public health treaty as countries take action.\" Some progress is being made: an analysis of 101 countries published in the 2019 Lancet Countdown found that most had a national climate and health strategy, including the United States, France, and Germany.114 Australia, however, did not. A 2021 analysis by the Global Climate and Health Alliance of how nations are including health in their commitments under the Paris Agreement gave Australia a score 0/15.115 This is despite widespread calls from health experts and health stakeholders since 2010 for a coordinated national response to the health impacts of climate change;116,117 calls that have intensified in recent years.118,119sUmm ARy 31 Climate and health policy in Australia As a federal system, responsibilities for governance of climate change and health related issues are distributed across national, state/territory and local governments. The Commonwealth The Australian Government has ratified the Paris Agreement, under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which obliges parties to consider 'citizen's right to health' in their national climate change response. Under this Agreement, Australia has committed to an economy-wide emissions target to reduce emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2030. Australia also has an obligation to contribute funding to the $100bn pa Green Climate Fund to help low-income countries deal with climate change and cut their emissions, however has not contributed any funding since 2019. A 2021 report reveals state and territory energy and climate policies, and action by households to install rooftop solar, are putting Australia on track for emissions reductions of 37-42% below 2005 levels, well beyond the stated federal ambition.120 At time of writing, the Commonwealth Department of Health does not have any specific programs targeting climate change and health. Funding for research in this field has been limited and is funded largely via very competitive grants from the Australian Research Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). While many NHMRC Centres of Research Excellence exist, none have yet been established on climate change and health121 \u2014 although a one-off $10m Special Initiative in Human Health and Environmental Change has been awarded in 2021.122 Adaptation funding has declined: the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF) was established in 2008 with $50 million over 5 years but funding was cut to $9 million during 2014-2017. There has been no further funding since 2018. While the Department of Health states that its vision is 'better health and wellbeing for all Australians, now and for future generations', climate change is not mentioned in Australia's Long-term National Health Plan, nor is it listed as a national health priority. The draft National Preventive Health Strategy (2020) does acknowledge climate change, however its commitment to developing a national environmental health strategy by 2030 is insufficient given the pace and scale of the climate crisis. Without national coordination and leadership from the Commonwealth on climate change and health, policies to guide mitigation and adaptation with respect to human health vary widely across state and territory jurisdictions. Below is a summary graphic of major climate policies and emissions targets by Australian jurisdiction (full tables in Appendix 7). Following this is a summary of state and territory-level policies and programs relevant to health and climate change. sUmm ARy 32 33sUmm ARy Major climate change mitigation policies and targets by jurisdiction COMMONWEALTH Climate Change Policy:Party to the Paris Agreement (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) Target: Reduce emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2030 net zero by 2050 Health Specific Policies:nil WESTERN AUSTRALIAQUEENSLAND Climate Change Policy:Western Australian Climate Policy (2020) Target: net zero by 2050 Health Specific Policies:nilNEW SOUTH WALES Climate Change Policy:nsW Climate Change Policy net Zero Plan Target: net zero by 2050 Reduce emissions by 50% below 2005 levels by 2030 Health Specific Policies:nilAUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY Climate Change Policy:Climate Change and g reenhouse g as Reduction Act 2010 ACt Climate Change s trategy 2019-2025 Target: net zero emissions by 30 june 2045 and interim targets to reduce emissions by: 50-60% by 2025; 65-75% by 2030; & Health Specific Policies:nilNORTHERN TERRITORY Climate Change Policy:Draft climate change policy (for finalisation in 2022) Emissions Reduction strategy Target: net zero emissions by 2050 50% renewables by 2030 Health Specific Policies:nilClimate Change Policy:Climate Action Plan 2020-2030 Climate Adaptation Strategy 2017-2030 Queensland Climate transition Strategy 2017 Target: net zero by 2050 Reduce emissions by 30% on 2005 levels by 2030 50% renewable energy by 2030 Health Specific Policies:Human Health and Wellbeing Climate Change Adaptation Plan (H-CAP), 2018 Queensland Health Climate Risk strategy 2021-s2026 SOUTH AUSTRALIA TASMANIAClimate Change Policy:Climate Change and greenhouse Emissions Reduction Act (2007) Climate Change Action Plan 2021-2025 Target: Reduce emissions by 40% of 1990 levels by 2050 100% renewable energy by 2030 Health Specific Policies:nilVICTORIA Climate Change Policy:Climate Change Act (2017) Target: net zero by 2050 (45-50% by 2030) 50% renewable energy by 2030 Health Specific Policies:victorian Public Health and Wellbeing Plan 2019-2023 Department of Health Environmental sustainability strategy 2018-19 to 2022-23 Health and Human services Climate Change Adaptation Action Plan 2022-2026Climate Change Policy:Climate Change ( state Action) Act 2008 Climate Change Action Plan Target: Reduce emissions by 60% of 1990 levels by 2050 Health Specific Policies:nilClimate change mitigation and adaptation policies and programs relevant to health by jurisdiction Victoria (VIC) The Victorian Public Health and Wellbeing Plan 2019- 2023 sets ten priorities for public health and wellbeing in Victoria, and four focus areas, one of which is 'tackling the health impacts of climate change'. A guidance for local councils was released in 2020 to assist them to consider climate change in municipal public health and wellbeing plans. The Department of Health Environmental Sustainability Strategy 2018-19 to 2022-23 included a pledge to join the Global Green Healthy Hospitals (GGHH) network, and to encourage all Victorian public health services to join and actively participate in the network. A Health and Human Services Climate Change Adaptation Action Plan 2022-2026 (in development) includes short, medium and long-term objectives to address current and future climate change impacts on health and build social and economic resilience.123 Queensland (QLD) Queensland has a state-wide Climate Adaptation Strategy 2017-2030, and seven Sector Adaptation Plans, including a Human Health and Wellbeing Climate Change Adaptation Plan (H-CAP) developed in 2018. In 2020, Queensland Health joined the GGHH network and committed to promote GGHH across Queensland Hospitals and Health Services. In 2021, Queensland Health created an Office of Hospital Sustainability (OHS), and the Queensland Government committed to implementing a $30 million program to install solar generation (solar panels) at 50 hospital sites. In 2021, Queensland Health released a Climate Risk Strategy 2021-2026 'to foster a climate ready and environmentally sustainable public health system', and Climate Change Adaptation Planning Guidance to support hospitals and health services to undertake climate risk assessment and adaptation planning. sUmm ARy 34 New South Wales (NSW) A NSW Government adaptation research hub includes a human health and social Impacts node. Many Local Health Districts in NSW are members of the GGHH network. An environmental sustainability plan for NSW Health is in development. Australian Capital Territory (ACT) As per its commitment in the ACT Climate Change Strategy, the ACT Health Directorate has joined the Global Green and Healthy Hospitals network (in 2020) as a means to \"improve sustainability performance and reduce emissions from ACT Health facilities\". In September 2020, the ACT Government announced that the Canberra Hospital Expansion (to be completed in 2024) will run on 100% renewable electricity. South Australia (SA) SA has no state-wide climate adaptation strategies, although there are 11 regional adaptation plans across the state. The Department of Health (Public Health) is leading the development of a climate change adaptation plan. SA Health's buildings account for around half of the government's greenhouse gas emissions. Since 2000, the energy efficiency of SA Health buildings has improved by more than 27%. A new Women's and Children's Hospital in Adelaide (due for completion in 2026) has been announced as the first all-electric hospital in Australia, and no fossil fuels used for heating, hot water or in kitchens within the building. Northern Territory (NT) The NT Government's Towards 2050 draft policy identifies climate resilience and preparedness as key actions, but has not yet commenced work in these and most other priority areas. The Health Department has appointed a climate change and health advisory committee. All NT health services are members of the GGHH network. Tasmania (TAS) Tasmania's Public Health Unit conducted the state's first Roundtable on Climate Change and Health in 2019. The subsequent report outlined a framework for action, based on the seven key areas of policy action identified in the 2017 Framework for a National Strategy on Climate, Health and Wellbeing for Australia. The Department of Health is also currently developing the Tasmanian preventive health strategic plan for the next 5 years, which has climate change and health as a key focus area. Western Australia (WA) The WA Climate and Health Inquiry report in 2020 laid out a path to protect the health of West Australians from climate health impacts. A key recommendation of the Inquiry, the establishment of a Sustainable Development Unit, is underway. Many health services in the state have joined the GGHH network. (Refer to Box 2 for more about the Inquiry).sUmm ARy 35 Box 2. Case Study: The WA Climate Health Inquiry In 2019, the WA Health Minister announced the world's first statutory inquiry into climate change and health, appointing the state's former Chief Health Officer, Dr Tarun Weeramanthri, as Chair. in Western Australia, as in much of the rest of the country, extreme weather is increasing the burden on human health, healthcare workers, and health budgets, already 31% of state expenditure. \"We had the one chance to do an in-depth, statutory inquiry,\" Dr Weeramanthri says. t he Inquiry team proactively invited submissions from premier and peak health organisations, including medical colleges. it held multiple public forums across the state and workshops designed especially for people from diverse backgrounds and those most vulnerable, including i ndigenous communities. As Inquiry Chair, Dr Weeramanthri describes his job as \"curatorship\", weaving together and communicating diverse expert opinions from almost 160 submissions: \"We thought our first task would be convincing people that climate change is a health issue, but the 2019-20 fires did that.\" In the Inquiry's final report, released in november 2020, the team endeavoured to ground the scientific climate-and-health story in more relatable, human stories. the Aboriginal Health Council of WA, for instance, describes: \"The ripple effects of climate change... [with] far-reaching direct impacts...\" on Aboriginal community health services, which \"bear witness to these impacts on Aboriginal people and their communities on a daily basis\".the result is a comprehensive but accessible report, which includes a ten-point action plan, and which seeks to \"make hope practical, not despair convincing\" . the report points to many \"green shoots\": the exemplary hospitals and services already working to simultaneously shrink health's carbon footprint, cut unnecessary costs, build resilience, and improve patient care. But it warns that attention \"has been markedly insufficient\" during the last \"lost decade\". t he coming decade demands \"a shift in culture and power within the sector\" and action that is \"top-down, bottom-up, and peer- to-peer\" . the WA government has since accepted, in principle , the Inquiry's recommendations, the minister has asked WA Health to prepare an implementation plan, and a sustainable Development Unit is in development. But, Dr Weeramanthri says, more needs to be done \"to close the gap between words and actions\" . Real progress, he says, is unlikely unless people in health champion it, including by using the Inquiry to bolster the case for action. The WA Climate Health Inquiry is widely praised for calling attention to the problem, amplifying marginalized voices, marking out a path forward, highlighting existing networks and partnerships for change, and seeding new ones. Above all, it tells governments: \"You have a strong and broad mandate for action from all of us in the health sector,\" Dr Weeramanthri says. \"Just start moving!\"sUmm ARy 36 The carbon footprint of healthcare in Australia In order to address the significant impacts of climate to health and health systems, we need to address the underlying causes of climate change \u2014 by committing to strong targets and actions to reduce emissions to at least net zero. This requires action across all sectors, including healthcare. Globally, healthcare accounts for about 4.4% of net emissions \u2014 equivalent to the annual emissions of more than 500 coal-fired power plants. If global healthcare were a country, it would rank fifth in emissions.124 Australia's health system, still largely reliant on coal- power, is roughly 7% of the nation's carbon footprint - equivalent to that of South Australia.28 Hospitals and health services are typically a state or territory's biggest user of electricity and account for 44% of the sector's national emissions. Pharmaceuticals account for 18% of emissions, while other sources including specialist and General Practice (GP) services account for 10%, followed by capital works at 8%. Most of Australian healthcare's emissions are embedded in its supply chains, i.e. the production, transport, and disposal of goods and services, particularly pharmaceuticals, but also food, medical devices, instruments, and hospital equipment. Despite the absence of guiding policy, there is widespread leadership emerging across the sector, in every jurisdiction, where hospitals, health services, and health systems are taking responsibility for their carbon and environmental footprint and working to reduce emissions in the sector and build climate resilience through healthcare focused climate mitigation and adaptation actions. Over 200 health systems, health networks, and individual hospitals and health services (representing approximately 1,700 individual facilities / services) are part of the Australian and AoNZ region of the Global Green and Healthy Hospitals (GGHH) network. In joining, these institutions have made a voluntary commitment to reduce their carbon and environmental footprint and promote public and environmental health by working on at least two of ten sustainability goals (energy, waste, water, buildings, transport, food, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, procurement, leadership). Many are working on more than two, and many have all ten goals at the centre of their environmental sustainability strategies. As both a regional and international collaborative community of practice, the GGHH network provides members with access to tools, resources, and guidance documents to support them to reduce their carbon and environmental footprints. Members also share strategies and practices, including through regular member meetings, publication of case studies, and an annual forum. Examples include Ambulance Victoria (AV), a distributed service provider with 260 locations, providing emergency response services across the state, who have entered into a power purchase agreement with a renewable energy farmer. This arrangement is enabling AV to reduce its greenhouse impact and providing the wind farmer assurance to invest and develop the project. This will reduce AV's emissions by 7% and is part of its commitment to source 100% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025.124 In Middlemore Hospital in AoNZ, as in Western Health in Victoria, efforts are being made to reduce anaesthetic gases, targeted due to their high global warming potential.125,126sUmm ARy 37 Box 3. Case Study: Hunter New England Health The Hunter New England Local Health District (LHD) in New South Wales (NSW) is the region's largest employer and a keystone in the local regional economy. In 2020, in an Australian first, Hunter New England declared they would be carbon and waste neutral by 2030. the District's broader sustainability plan includes investment in clean renewable power, ambitious commitments to collect and conserve water, eliminate general waste, and switch to all-electric vehicles. All of it is backed up by a sound business case, accountability at board level, and strong staff support. Dr Ramsey Awad, the District's Director of infrastructure, Planning and sustainability says: \"all our actions have saved money, and all our savings are invested back into patient care.\" Former Hunter New England Board Chair, A/Prof Lyn Fragar A o, said: \"lightbulbs kept coming on,\" as the Board realized that an ambitious sustainability agenda was smart risk management, and entirely 'doable'. A/Prof Fragar said nobody in the industry seemed to be talking about the governance risks of inaction on emissions. \"I knew the Board needed a business case, so I asked the Executive to prepare one.\" the evidence was compelling and the goals and pathway clear. Even before the plan was signed off, the Board began to set the tone by modelling simple sustainable behaviours, such as car-sharing and avoiding unnecessary plastic utensils. staff engagement is vital to the plan's success. Dr Awad says: \"The best thing for me was the staff response to our call for sustainability champions.\" since early 2020, more than 150 staff members including clinicians have joined \"communities of interest\", with high- level support to \"push the envelope\" of what is possible in sustainable healthcare. Using a mix of incentives, from salary sacrifices for electric bikes to strategic procurement, the District is making it easier for staff to be part of the wider effort both at work and in relation to their own carbon footprint. the District is learning by doing - and no-one pretends they have all the answers right now. Following the lead of the UK's Sustainable Development Unit, the District has made sustainable procurement a priority; using its purchasing power to drive innovation in supply chains \u2014 the source of a big chunk of health's carbon footprint. But, says Dr Awad, bureaucratic and commercial hurdles often get in the way. \"Recycling facilities are located in major cities,\" he says, \"making recycling cost-prohibitive in many rural areas.\" And decisions made at the state level, such as contracting a single provider of energy or waste management, can stifle innovation at the District level. \"We see ourselves as leading a movement for sustainability in the sector,\" says Dr Awad, and his team keeps looking for gaps and opportunities in the current system to do what they need to do to hit their targets. There are also signs that the District's pledges are changing the game, with other LHD Boards showing a keener interest in sustainability, and NSW Health has begun work on a sustainability plan. More broadly, Hunter New England LHD is demonstrating to the health sector what ambitious climate policy can look like.sUmm ARy 38 Prevention \u2014 upstream and downstream opportunities As well as working to reduce emissions in healthcare through the kinds of measures described above, a key pathway to improving both climate and health outcomes is through prevention \u2014 and the avoidance of 'low-value' and 'no-value care'. That is, eliminating care that produces little to no benefit to patients, or even has the potential to cause them harm. Low and no-value care is estimated to make up 40% of total care given in Australia (30% and 10%, respectively), and includes things such as over testing, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment. Low value and no value care are also an unnecessary use of time, money, and resources \u2014 as well as an avoidable increase in healthcare's carbon footprint. By reducing low and no-value care, there can be a win-win-win. 1. Patients will only be receiving effective, high-value healthcare; 2. Money will not be spent on ineffective care; 3. The environment will benefit from a reduction in the carbon footprint of healthcare. Prevention of ill-health in the population is an obvious pathway to reducing emissions in healthcare \u2014 and better public health outcomes. As noted above, Australia spends far too little on prevention, despite the evidence that every $1 invested in prevention can save as much as $12 in health spending.127 Investing in upstream health promotion programs to encourage healthy behaviours and practices can reduce pressure on health services, avoid carbon intensive and costly procedures and hospital admissions. Other methods to reduce healthcare emissions and improve patient outcomes include regular medication reviews to reduce polypharmacy, and improving access to community care and telehealth services, providing care which can be better, cheaper and lower carbon.128Key Findings Insights from policy and institutional analysis and interviews Informant key PM: Policymaker HCP: Health Communications Professional HSR: Health Systems ResearcherKEy FinDings 39 The prevention agenda in healthcare is analogous to the need to invest in upstream strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and avoid the costly and damaging impacts of climate change. This is becoming increasingly apparent to many in the health sector \u2014 as one informant noted: \"Mitigation [of health's carbon footprint] is preventive care.\" (HCP) Risk management and legal liability Climate change is increasingly understood as a corporate governance issue in the form of legal risk, including in the health sector, presenting as it does foreseeable and material risks to which directors of boards are required to respond as part of their fiduciary duty.129 Health service boards and managers should inform themselves of the risk the impact of climate change poses to their organisation in their governance of strategy and risk, and as part of acting 'in the best interests' of their organisation.130 This is relevant to all boards and managers, whether they are regulated under the Corporations Act , state and territory incorporated associations laws, or public entity governance laws. \"Importantly, directors of public authorities \u2014 such as the chairs and boards of public hospitals and health services \u2014 have similar, if not more stringent duties of care and diligence.\"131 Directors may be found to have breached their duty if they do not appropriately disclose the risks posed by climate change to the entity they govern \u2014 and may even be found personally liable in a court for failing to give appropriate consideration to climate change risks.132 Our analysis, however, suggests that there still is little grasp of health services' legal liability with respect to climate change. None of our key informants raised it unprompted, and (with one exception) the common view was that it is not a problem for public hospitals and health services. KEy FinDings 40 The funding challenge \u2014 and an opportunity through purchasing Investment is considered one of the major barriers to action, and there is a strong case from the literature, as well as key informant interviews, for significantly scaled up funding to support climate mitigation and adaptation actions to reduce health risks and support health services to mitigate and adapt. As one informant remarked: \"Funding is a barrier. Health competes with other portfolios and the scale of the [climate] challenge is huge.\" (PM) However, it has also been noted that among all the many strategies available to reduce healthcare's climate footprint, many informants pointed to health's purchasing power as a way to drive systemic change, within and without the system. As with Greener NHS, as a significant purchaser of goods and services, the health sector in Australia has the potential to drive change across its supply chain \u2014 which is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the health sector. This could be done by requiring suppliers to meet environmental criteria and having net zero plans to secure healthcare procurement contracts. Among informants, this was considered one of the most powerful levers of change. \"There is an enormous potential to use healthcare's purchasing power and influence to accelerate change.\" (HSR) Building capacity for action Health and medical professionals are concerned and want information and support According to a 2020 Victorian survey of more than 700 GPs, specialists, and allied health practitioners133 concern for the impact of climate change on the health system is high. Most respondents considered they had a duty of care to inform their patients and clients about climate risks to their health, yet only one-in-three felt sufficiently informed to speak with confidence. This is reinforced by the 2021 Real, Urgent and Now national survey of 875 physicians, nurses, midwives, public health and health promotion professionals and medical students. 72% of respondents to this survey indicated climate change was already having an adverse impact on public health in Australia, and over half (56%) reported their health service or healthcare institution had been adversely affected by a climate related extreme weather event in the 12 months prior to the survey. Over half of respondents (54%) said they wanted more information from their professional association on climate change to support their practice. KEy FinDings 41 While many universities are beginning to include climate change in undergraduate and postgraduate health sciences curricula, there remains a huge gap in the existing workforce about the nature of the problem, the available solutions, and the role of the health professions in responding. Leadership and collaboration for change Leadership is key to achieving effective outcomes on climate change and health: this is perhaps the strongest, most consistent message from key informants to this analysis and from our reading of the literature. Initiative and a willingness to take risks \u2014 or to enable others to do so \u2014 are considered essential ingredients. As one informant (SPM3) put it: \"Leadership is required at many levels- state, district, clinical, academic and personal \u2014 from the organisational head to the most junior staff member. In our experience mid-ranking managers and junior nursing and medical staff are often the most innovative and engaged drivers of sustainability initiatives.\" There is a need for 'joined-up action' across government departments and portfolios, especially given that many drivers of ill-health (including those associated with climate change) are the result of activities in sectors other than health. As The Lancet said in its 2015 Health and Climate Commission: we need mechanisms to \"facilitate collaboration between Ministries of Health and other government departments, empowering health professionals and ensuring that health and climate considerations are thoroughly integrated in government-wide strategies\". Despite limited progress on climate health policy to date in Australia, there is considerable leadership from the health professions in advocacy for action. The last decade has seen rising awareness of climate risks within the health workforce, with strong calls to action by a growing number of organisations \u2014 from grassroots groups to learned academies. For example, over 50 health groups produced a framework for a national strategy on climate, health and wellbeing for Australia in 2017 to guide governments, and the health sector in taking action. In 2019, the AMA declared climate change a health emergency, and called for a National Strategy for Health and Climate Change. In 2020, the Australian Indigenous Doctors Association released a policy statement on climate change and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's health, and in 2021, twelve medical groups released an Open Letter to the Prime Minister, calling for a commitment to an ambitious national plan to protect health by cutting Australia's greenhouse gas emissions this decade. These and many other groups are building a powerful case for action, and have consulted on, thought through, and set out ideas, benchmarks and roadmaps for progress.134,135 These efforts inform and guide, as well as hold governments to account, and are growing a vibrant, broad and increasingly influential national and international health movement for climate action.KEy FinDings 42 The way forward The analysis here, together with the case studies and literature review, point to clear directions to tackle the impacts of climate change on the health system in Australia. Strategies to limit the cause of climate change \u2014 greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 will reduce future threats to the population and the health system. Actions to prepare health systems, and reduce climate change risks, as well as reduce the contribution of the health sector to the problem, are vital. Therefore strong national and subnational emissions reductions targets, coupled with plans and programs to deliver them, are needed. This must include plans to guide (and strategies to accelerate) the decarbonisation of healthcare to meet those targets. An authorizing policy and legislative framework is needed to guide action. This must include science- based policies, strategies, plans and practical guidance on climate change adaptation and mitigation at national, state, regional and local scales. It should also facilitate collaboration between health departments and other departments, to ensure health and climate considerations appear in government wide policies and approaches. This framework can provide clarity on roles and responsibilities and support effective and transparent governance. Implementation will require financial investment to support climate change mitigation and adaptation action. This must include resources to build capacity to address climate change in the sector, as well as evaluate risks, assess vulnerability, and develop evidence-informed and innovative solutions. It will also require practical actions such as changes to energy contracts to support purchasing of renewable energy and procurement contracts to help healthcare suppliers transition towards net zero supply chains. Strengthening and building resilience to climate change across the population, and particularly in priority communities, will reduce pressures on the health system, reduce the risks of harm, and help avoid the human and economic costs of climate-related disasters. Prevention, therefore, is key: investing in upstream health promotion and illness prevention is already a national priority, but requires far greater resourcing to realise system-wide benefits. Too much of the response to climate change in Australia currently relies on reactive response measures \u2014 much more is required to prepare for and avoid harm before it occurs. As The Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change has emphasised, many climate mitigation and adaptation actions are 'no-regrets' strategies when it comes to health i.e. they can help reduce the burden of ill-health, enhance community resilience, and address existing health inequities. With an engaged and empowered health and medical workforce, sufficient investment, and the enabling vehicles of policy, legislation and regulation, along with political and institutional leadership, the Australian health system can, and must, become an international leader in the global effort to tackle climate change. There is much to gain, and everything to lose. KEy FinDings 43 Case Studies SUMMARY AND FINDINGS45sUmm ARy Summary The Case studies illustrate the real life impact of climate change on the health of Australians, and the healthcare system. They point to the need for greater preparedness among communities and within the health system for future climate fuelled disasters. They also demonstrate the need for urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to avoid locking in further disastrous climate change. Case studies were identified through experts and key persons in the field, including representatives of the medical colleges involved in this project. Case studies were selected using selection criteria that relate to the substantive properties of the cases themselves and on the basis that they illustrated the impacts of climate change on the Australian healthcare system. Key selection criteria included: \u008fA cross-section of socioeconomic and geographic areas and different contexts and stakeholders; \u008fIndigenous peoples' health status and flow on impacts on health; and \u008fRural and remote communities' health status and flow on impacts for health via the impact on health systems. The case studies demonstrate that climate change poses a significant risk to the healthcare system in Australia. There have already been severe impacts to the healthcare system from drought, bushfires, extreme heat, flood, coastal inundation and other climate-related events. These events are predicted to become more frequent and extreme as the Earth continues to warm. Climate change affects the health system in many ways and can impact healthcare infrastructure, operations, workforce, and service demand. There is a danger of workforce burnout and disenfranchisement in the face of existing and projected climate and health challenges, and in the absence of vision, direction and collaborative, coordinated action. Furthermore, climate change associated events can disrupt health system energy supply, communications systems, and supply chains. These impacts can be sudden and cause major challenges to the delivery of safe, quality care. The case studies illustrate the real-life impact of climate change on the health of Australians, and the healthcare system. They point to the need for greater preparedness among communities and within the health system for future climate fuelled disasters. They also demonstrate the need for urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to avoid locking in further disastrous climate change. 46sUmm ARy Based on the findings of these case studies, several insights have emerged: \u008fThe health system is generally not prepared for the impacts of climate change; \u008fA nationally coordinated approach is needed to ensure appropriate responses to climate change across all jurisdictions; \u008fAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voices need to be clearly heard and should be central in the development of plans to guide climate preparedness, as well as disaster and emergency response affecting their communities. They should have access to community-driven, culturally safe, and properly resourced responses to disasters and equally to resilience building and preparedness for future impacts. Indigenous- and community-led or co-led approaches that embrace all sectors are vital and promising approaches; \u008fLikewise, in rural and regional settings, consultation with local stakeholders including those within the health system should be part of climate change responses as well as disaster preparedness and planning; \u008fFlexible and secure, long-term funding arrangements are needed before, during and after disasters so that health services can prepare for and respond to demand surges; \u008fResponding to the threat of climate change requires strategic imagination to transform a reactive system to one that is proactive: focused on the delivery of high-value, low carbon, and sustainable healthcare, increasing community self-care, prevention and early intervention to prevent serious adverse clinical outcomes and keep people out of hospitals; and \u008fHealth leaders, and health professionals more generally, have a key role to play in advocacy to all levels of government for greater action on climate change. Equally important, they can help empower communities to make the necessary adaptive and mitigative changes to respond to climate change. Health practitioners want information and support to be able to do this. 47KEy FinDings Key Findings NORTHERN TERRITORY Extreme heat and workforce issues Climate change is a clear and present threat to the survival of First nations people and culture and threatens to further reduce the health workforce available to support the health needs of the population. RURAL AND REMOTE, NATIONAL Mental health workshops for rural and remote health workforce Along with their communities, the rural and remote health workforce is exhausted following multiple climate related traumas and impacts of the C oviD-19 pandemic. Peer delivered mental health self-care workshops provided some relief following 'Black Summer' bushfires. TORRES STRAIT ISLANDS Sea level rise and coastal inundation Climate change is harming Country, culture, identity and health. the torres strait region has pioneered collaborative community-informed Regional Adaptation and Resilience Planning but needs sustained partnerships and resourcing for implementation. STANTHORPE, QLD Compounding and cascading impacts Amidst the drought and fears of a Day Zero event, bushfires struck before the COVID-19 pandemic arrived. Mental health has been significantly affected and there has been no time or capacity to prepare for future climate-related impacts. WESTERN SYDNEY, NSW Extreme heat and widening health inequity Increasing health inequity and potentially unliveable suburbs; Western Sydney provides a window into the future for other Australian cities without assertive transformational mitigation and adaptation strategies at local and national levels. CANBERRA, ACT Bushfire smoke Equipment failed and air filtration in Canberra Hospital was unable to deal with the unprecedented levels of smoke. strategic imagination is part of the toolkit for climate change responses to anticipate and prepare for future scenarios. SOUTH COAST, NSW Bushfires 'Apocalyptic' experiences, skies filled with smoke, and the world out of reach as power, telecommunications, and roads were cut off by the fires highlight vulnerabilities of local health services. QUEENSLAND Mental health impacts following drought, fires, floods and impacts on children and young people New, more universal, community resilience focused models of care are required to address mental health needs from growing climate related trauma. 48KEy FinDings Stanthorpe, QLD: Compounding Impacts Context Stanthorpe is a regional town located roughly 215 km south-west of Brisbane (QLD) in the Southern Downs Regional Council 136. Agriculture, tourism and hospitality are all important industries in the region which is well known for its wineries and fresh produce.137 In May 2018, the Southern Downs council was officially declared 'in drought'.138 A failed wet season the following summer triggered fears that Stanthorpe's standalone water supply, Storm King Dam, would reach its minimum operating level before the next wet season.139 This would lead to a Day Zero event where the water supply runs out and residential taps are turned off.140 Medical Superintendent of Stanthorpe Hospital, Dr Dan Halliday owns a grazing property himself and believes it was \"the worst drought that developed in anyone's living memory\". Fruit trees and vineyards were dying, and farmers were having to destock, losing generations worth of work. With people in the community desperate for employment, the drought and its economic consequences took an enormous toll on mental health. Amidst the drought and fears of a Day Zero event, bushfires struck Stanthorpe in September 2019.141 While the immediate threat to the town only lasted days, fires burned in the area for weeks, leaving many in the town on edge and anxious. Poor air quality from the bushfire smoke lasted months, having a significant impact on respiratory patients, the elderly, and asthmatics in the community.Not long after the smoke cleared, Stanthorpe officially ran out of water. As a result, the town was dependent on daily deliveries of 40 to 50 truckloads of water from over 60km away.139,140 To make matters worse, the COVID-19 pandemic hit Australia and serious concerns were raised over the ability to ensure community safety with such limited water supply. While water restrictions were eased, it meant that even more water had to be trucked in to meet the town's needs. Impact to the health system With the community facing a drought, the bushfires, and then a pandemic, Stanthorpe's health services were impacted. The most obvious example was the increased need to provide mental health support to patients following the onset of the drought. Former rural practice registrar, Dr June Brundell said, \"it got to the point where every single general practice consult I did started with a mental health check to make sure I didn't have someone suicidal sitting there\". \"When you sit through 30 or 40 or 50 patients a day telling you how tough it is and how their mental health is, it's really hard not to take that trauma home and internalise it because you can't do anything\". Dr Brundell said there was \"not enough room in the [health] system to provide the support to the doctors that they needed\". The rural GPs were already stretched and had the additional workload from the mental health effects of the drought. This meant that getting a GP appointment could be difficult for patients at times. As a result, people were turning up to the hospital emergency department with issues that would usually be resolved by their general practitioner.49KEy FinDings Stanthorpe, QLD: Compounding Impacts Dr Halliday noted an increase in people presenting with skin diseases due to bathing less to conserve water. Presentations of gastroenteritis increased because of poor quality drinking water, generally coming from the bottom of their water tanks. The bushfires also impacted the health system. During the peak of the bushfire threat, the town and hospital were left without power for more than 24 hours. The hospital ran on backup generators, but urgent fuel supplies had to be trucked in to maintain power. The roads leading to and from the hospital were also intermittently cut off by the fires making the hospital emergency plan impossible to enact. Emergency evacuations, such as a critical patient run over by a fire truck, were delayed. Inside the hospital, patients were distressed as the bushfire smoke seeped into the wards. Dr Brundell said that the air quality was so poor she \"couldn't see to the end of the corridor\". Poor air quality was an ongoing issue in the following months and increased the demand by respiratory patients for GP time. Providing care in an environment of poor air quality was challenging, as vulnerable patients were unwilling to come out of their homes. This meant that home visits or telehealth were required. Image credit: CSIRO50KEy FinDings Stanthorpe, QLD: Compounding Impacts While telehealth is now the new normal, these appointments were difficult to bill pre-COVID-19. Dr Brundell is pleased by the shift towards telehealth, and said \"the ability to deliver telehealth from general practice is a big deal when you live rurally... it's a way of being able to deliver safe care in a changing climate\". Health system response As the drought worsened, Dr Halliday and Dr Brundell could both see the emerging crisis resulting from the region's water shortage. Their reaction was to investigate potential public health responses, and compile locally relevant policy measures that could be implemented. For example, providing rebates for the installation of hydropanels (a technology that uses the power of the sun to extract drinking water from the air). Despite initial engagement by local government stakeholders, Dr Halliday said they weren't able to attain higher level endorsement. He noted that metropolitan decision makers don't always understand the needs of rural communities. Dr Halliday points to the importance of local staff initiative and connectedness on the ground in being able to respond effectively to the bushfires, even when the emergency plan had failed. An example was that the hospital had integrated primary care services, such as GP clinics that could act as back-up treatment facilities if the road to the hospital was cut off. This was possible due to the good relationships between the clinics and hospital, with many GPs working across both. Lessons and implications Since the fires in 2019, Dr Halliday said that there had been almost no change that would allow health services to respond more effectively if they experienced fires again. He said that the short news cycle that affects government policymaking had moved on. Dr Brundell explained, \"our health services are stretched to start with, and now they're involved in a pandemic response, so getting buy-in in terms of time, money, resources, and mental space from people who make decisions and who set policy in the current climate is challenging\". Dr Halliday suggests that there must be preparation and planning for when COVID-19 stabilises and there is a firm agenda back on climate change. When that time comes, both he and Dr Brundell believe that stakeholder engagement must be integrated into policy development moving forward. Dr Brundell said that a \"major lesson learnt [from the bushfires] across Australia is that we need to better involve rural and regional areas in their own disaster planning\" . To allow communities and local clinicians to be empowered when responding to climate emergencies, Dr Halliday believes that \"resources need to be put into local communities \u2014 local primary care providers and councils \u2014 people they [the community] know and trust.\"51KEy FinDings Canberra, ACT: Bushfire Smoke Context The Australian bushfires of 2019-20 were unprecedented, both in scale and duration. In addition to the death and injury caused by the bushfires themselves, the smoke from the fires affected large parts of Australia, and travelled as far around the globe as South America.142 Research has estimated that the smoke alone was responsible for more than 400 excess deaths, and over 3,000 hospitalisations for cardiovascular and respiratory problems.143 Other common health issues associated with the smoke were irritation of the eyes and throat, coughing, and headaches.144 Total health costs from the bushfire smoke are estimated to be $1.95 billion, with longer-term health impacts still unknown. The Australian Capital Territory experienced particularly poor air quality over several months, with Canberra recording the worst air quality in the world in early January. At its peak, PM2.5 (very fine particles) concentrations were more than 26 times the hazardous level (or 200 times the 'safe' level), forcing a number of institutions and government departments in Canberra to shut down due to health and safety concerns.145 Many homes were inundated with smoke. Those most fortunate were able to access air purifiers. However, the accompanying heatwave, well in excess of the temperature many homes in Canberra are built for, meant that managing the heat and smoke was a balancing act between passive cooling (e.g. opening windows) and maintaining indoor air quality. Canberra gynaecologist Dr Steve Robson says \"Scorching temperatures made...our homes almost intolerable\" .146 Those with significantly reduced financial resources were most likely to be impacted, especially in homes without proper insulation or air conditioning, and who weren't able to afford an air purifier. Impact to the health system The air filtration system in Canberra Hospital was unable to deal with the unprecedented levels of smoke leading to unhealthy levels of PM2.5 inside the buildings.147 Medical equipment including pathology, MRI and CT machines failed from the smoke and heat. Sterilised equipment in the hospital was also contaminated, and staff themselves were affected by the smoke.147 Dr Robson wrote about his experience at the time, he said \"Canberra's operating theatres and birth suites were infiltrated by smoke, as it metastasized into the inner sancta where our new generation were born and our most vulnerable were undergoing surgery. For the first time...I was beginning to hear things I hadn't heard in 30 years of O&G practice \u2014 that people were apprehensive about having children because they were worried about the future\".146 52KEy FinDings Canberra, ACT: Bushfire Smoke Health system response Canberra Health Services responded to the smoke by installing air purifiers in wards and providing 'comfort packs' to staff that contained eye drops and throat lozenges. They maintained that even on days with \"unhealthy air\" inside the hospital, the wards were safe for patients.147 Cardiologist Dr Arnagretta Hunter questions why health services didn't predict the smoke despite many experts predicting a potentially catastrophic bushfire season. \"Unprecedented is not an excuse for being unprepared,\" said Dr Hunter. She said that if health services were regularly performing climate risk assessments, the risk could have been anticipated and the health system could have prepared much better. Lessons and implications Dr Hunter said \"the only way that we can increase and improve our preparation moving forward is if we use some strategic imagination...which will take science, creativity and interdisciplinary work\" . Using our strategic imagination is vital so that we can think through future scenarios, like what might happen if Melbourne experienced temperatures of 55C. As well as strategic imagination, Dr Hunter believes that a paradigm shift in the healthcare system needs to take place to be able to deal with the health impacts of climate change in the future. She said that \"biology, society and environment all have key roles in our health and wellbeing. This should be reflected in our health system.\" She said that we need \"a paradigm shift away from looking after people reactively to thinking much more proactively.\" She said \"it is tremendously important that we recognise that we can take a much more proactive approach to risk reduction into the future and that focusing on mitigation and adaptation will only have benefits for us as the climate continues to change.\" Image credit: ABC News Online, 25/5/202053KEy FinDings South Coast, NSW: Bushfires Context By the end of 2019, most of NSW, including the South East, was in 'intense drought' after more than two years of drought conditions.148 The drought, together with high temperatures, low humidity, and high fuel loads proved to be the perfect conditions for bushfires, which ravaged the South Coast of NSW, over several months in late 2019 and early 2020. As the fires moved through forested areas towards coastal towns, thousands of holiday makers found themselves in life threatening danger on several occasions. Many describe their experience of the Black Summer fires as 'apocalyptic'. Skies were red and filled with smoke, and the world was out of reach as power, telecommunications, and roads were cut off by the fires. As local General Practitioner, Dr Michelle Hamrosi put it, \"normal life stopped and you were in survival mode.\" Dr Michael Holland, specialist Obstetrician Gynaecologist for the Eurobodalla region said, \"women felt their babies were safer inside than outside, so they held onto them until the danger had passed.\" Excessive smoke and heat created hazards for people's physical health. Nursing home residents sweltered through forty-plus degree days without air conditioning when their facility lost power and had no back-up generator. Waminda South Coast Women's Health and Welfare Aboriginal Corporation said that the bushfires \"affected health, wellbeing and safety, and destroyed sacred sites, the habitats of culturally significant animals, and big swathes of Country.\"149 Image credit: CSIRO - Climate change in the Northern Territory | State of the science and climate change impacts, 202054KEy FinDings South Coast, NSW: Bushfires The building that housed the Mogo Aboriginal Land Council also went up in flames, destroying cultural and legal documentation and historical artifacts within it. Dr Holland speaks to the overwhelming psychological effect of an impending disaster and said that \"the impact on people's mental health is still present.\" Dr Hamrosi said that the bushfires also re- traumatised people whose lives had previously been threatened by fires, such as in the South Coast township of Tathra 18 months earlier. Not long after the bushfire recovery process had started, the COVID-19 pandemic struck Australia. For people already experiencing anxiety from the bushfires, the pandemic was yet another external threat to their health. \"It has certainly left people more isolated and lonely and socially distanced at a time where coming together was really important for recovery,\" said Dr Hamrosi. Impact to the health system The bushfires had a direct impact on the health system, coming dangerously close to the local hospitals and leaving other services without power. \"It highlighted vulnerabilities of local health services for any sort of major disaster\", said Dr Holland. He said, \"there was concern that we would be overrun with people coming to the hospital seeking care we couldn't provide.\" He further explained that emergency departments were in desperate need of oxygen supplies, while the backup generators for the hospital could not produce enough power to run an emergency CT scan.In the primary health setting, Dr Hamrosi said, \"we ran the general practice without power or phones or internet. We just tried to use the natural light through the windows and had head torches when needed.\" Without access to patient records, Dr Hamrosi explained that it was difficult to determine whether patients had heart or lung problems when they came in with shortness of breath and chest pain, or if it was due to smoke inhalation. Other issues began to emerge in communities after the immediate threat had passed. Waminda said there were \"spikes in respiratory issues from smoke and haze, and an increased need for mental health support for trauma and anxiety.\"149 Angela Stewart, a Carer Advocate for One Door Mental Health in the Eurobodalla said \"once I went back to work, every single client had a bushfire story.\" Manager for Psychosocial Supports for Grand Pacific Health in Bega, Nikki Jordan agreed, saying that the months following the fires was when \"service capacity became stretched.\" On top of the increased demand was the impact of the bushfires to health workers. \"What was really tough was staff who were in it [the bushfires] were providing counselling to people who were also in it,\" said Ms Jordan. \"We lived through this too,\" said Ms Stewart 55KEy FinDings South Coast, NSW: Bushfires \"Not only has the community been affected, but I think a lot of the medical staff are fatigued by the stress of that experience,\" said Dr Holland. Health system response As the bushfires became more threatening to the Moruya hospital, a Director of Acts of Emergency instituted an emergency plan. Instead of ward rounds inside the hospital with patients, staff did a ward round outside the hospital to see where the vulnerabilities were. Hospital staff went above and beyond their normal roles and responsibilities, one doctor coming to work even after losing his own home. In the community, Waminda responded immediately, \"checking that people were safe, purchasing and distributing emergency supplies, and extending operations beyond its boundaries and core business.\"149 However, not all responses to the bushfires were constructive. Members of Aboriginal communities along the South Coast reported \"poor, culturally unsafe services being provided by some mainstream services and charities during the bushfires.\"149 Lessons and implications Many lessons have come out of the bushfires that provide pathways for the health system to better respond to such disasters in the future. Coordination between local and central disaster response can be improved. In the hospital, Dr Holland said that the \"management on site seemed to be overruled by management elsewhere\" for reasons unknown to them. Consultation and integration of local GPs in disaster planning is needed. Dr Hamrosi noted that GPs whose clinics had been closed could have been utilised in the response, for example at evacuation centres, but some were even turned away when they offered their services. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health organisations say \"they must be consulted in the development of emergency plans affecting their communities... The bushfires highlighted injustices and inequity in Australia's disaster management systems, and the critical need for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to have access to community-driven, culturally safe, and properly resourced responses to disasters.\" Waminda South Coast Women's Health and Welfare Aboriginal Corporation149 Ms Jordan also indicated that there have been some changes within her organisation in response to the bushfires. She and her staff now have satellite phones in case of power outages and a new policy around leave during extreme weather events to assure staff of their job. However, her vision for a better health system is one that is proactive, preventative, and prepared for a changing climate. 56KEy FinDings Northern Territory: Extreme Heat and Workforce Issues Context The vast and sparsely populated Northern Territory is already experiencing the impacts of climate change, including extreme heat and record breaking temperatures, particularly during summer months.150 Over the summer of 2019-20, temperatures were almost 4 degrees higher than the long- term average.150 Temperatures are expected to increase further in the future, with rainfall patterns set to be more variable.151 Extreme heat can cause heat stress and dehydration, which can exacerbate cardiovascular, renal, and other chronic health issues.152 Dr Simon Quilty, a Senior Staff Specialist at Alice Springs Hospital, said that climate change is \"an extremely urgent threat\" and the \"implications for all communities across the Northern Territory are extremely severe.\" A long historical legacy of injustice and ongoing health inequities means that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will be disproportionately affected. Dr Catherine Pendrey, a General Practitioner who has worked for several years in the Northern Territory suggests that the frequent and extreme heat is \"exacerbating health problems caused by inequitable access to housing, energy security, and cooling, among other challenges...When it gets hotter, people get sicker and those experiencing chronic health issues and socio-economic disadvantage are most likely to be affected.\"Dr Quilty said that \"Indigenous households have severe energy insecurity.\" He said, \"this impacts peoples' ability to shelter from extreme heat. On a hot day, the inside of a house can go over 50C and there is nowhere to shelter. Insulin and other medications cook. The health implications are immediate and severe.\" 57KEy FinDings Northern Territory: Extreme Heat and Workforce Issues In addition to the extreme heat and energy issues, the Northern Territory is also experiencing severe water insecurities. Dr Quilty explained that last year the town of Yuendumu came within weeks of running out of water. He said \"in some places, there is a very real risk of climate change drying up fragile aquifers and causing forced displacement from Traditional Homelands.\" Dr Josie Douglas, Manager for Policy at Central Land Council said, \"Central Australian Aboriginal people are very resilient. They have evolved to cope with the harsh and variable desert climate, but there are limits.\"153 She said \"without action to stop climate change, people will be forced to leave their country and leave behind much of what makes them Aboriginal. Climate change is a clear and present threat to the survival of our people and their culture.\"153 Impact to the health system The impact of extreme heat and water insecurity is having very real impacts on health services in the Northern Territory already. Dr Quilty, who is also a Medical Advisor to Northern Territory Aboriginal health service, Purple House, explains that in the last five years the Indigenous-owned and run health service has had to buy chillers to cool the water used for their remote dialysis program. Water coming from the pipes is hotter than it's ever been before, which means it needs to be cooled before use. Seven of the 19 remote communities that Purple House works in are also facing extreme water insecurity. In some cases, Purple House is forbidden from providing dialysis due to the quantity of water required for each dialysis session. Dr Quilty said that as a result, \"Purple House's capacity to meet the increasing need for more dialysis is being rapidly eroded.\" There is also the threat of increased workforce shortages in the Northern Territory as a result of climate change. A paper by Dr Pendrey, Dr Quilty and colleagues indicates that approximately one third of the 362 doctors surveyed suggested that climate change is already causing or likely to cause them to consider leaving the Northern Territory. The paper warns \"if even modest numbers of medical practitioners in the Northern Territory did so [left], health-care workforce shortages, staff turnover, and reliance on short-term staff would be greatly exacerbated, leading to less effective care, higher hospitalisation rates, and higher costs of healthcare\" .154 Dr Pendrey said that \"not only is there going to be a greater need for healthcare workers, but our study suggests that there may well be less healthcare workers in those areas.\"58KEy FinDings Northern Territory: Extreme Heat and Workforce Issues Health system response Both Dr Pendrey and Dr Quilty expressed their concern that the health system was not responding to the risk of climate change at the pace or scale needed to protect the health of Territorians. Dr Quilty said that in the Northern Territory \"there is a desire to mitigate carbon emissions from healthcare but there is little action.\" Dr Pendrey also expressed concern that there is currently no heat health response plan, inadequate public messaging about extreme heat, and many people in public housing do not have access to air conditioning or cool spaces. She said \"the Northern Territory really shows how much of a public health emergency climate change is\" and \"we need to respond now.\"Lessons and implications Dr Douglas said \"people are already mitigating climate change through traditional burning and they are investing their income from land use agreements to install solar power, plant bush tucker gardens in communities and operate swimming pools, but all that counts for little in the face of the lack of climate leadership from the government.\"153 Both Dr Pendrey and Dr Quilty emphasised the immediacy of the threat and the urgency to act now. Dr Pendrey asserts that there should be heat health plans developed in partnership with communities and put in place before summer arrives. Improving public housing infrastructure and making sure people have energy security and consistent access to cool spaces no matter where they live are also important. Her recent paper suggests that \"climate-related concerns should feature in the national health workforce strategy\" while a \"comprehensive National Plan for Health and Climate Change would address the challenges faced by remote and Indigenous communities, who are at particular risk, and by the workforce that supports their health needs.\"154 There is a desire to mitigate carbon emissions from healthcare but there is little action.\"59KEy FinDings Torres Strait: Rising Sea Levels, Culture, Identity and Health Context The Torres Strait is on the front line of rising sea levels and increasing storm surges, among other severe climate impacts. Many of the seventeen inhabited Torres Strait Islands are low-lying coral cays or 'mud islands', already regularly affected by coastal erosion and saltwater inundation. This is causing extreme distress in the community. Torres Strait Islander peoples want to stay on their traditional lands for the long term, and to maintain their cultural responsibilities, identity and kinship connections. However, climate change is increasingly harming country, culture and health. Socio-economic disadvantage and high levels of chronic disease in this 70% Aboriginal and/ or Torres Strait Islander population means average life expectancy is nearly fifteen years shorter than that of mainland Queenslanders. Climate-sensitive infectious diseases including tuberculosis, dengue, Ross River virus and melioidosis are present at high rates.155 About 80% of electricity and transport is powered by imported diesel and many communities rely on diesel-powered desalination plants to secure water supply. Housing stock is often aging and poorly designed for heat. Family ties and mobility between Torres Strait Island communities and neighbouring under-resourced Papua New Guinea villages adds pressure to resources and services. A 2018 climate and health risk assessment identified expected health impacts including increased heat-related health impacts, death and injury from extreme weather events, spread of vector-borne and other diseases, declines in the quality and availability of local food sources, declines in the availability, safety and quality of drinking water, increased impacts on mental health, displacement of people from their homes, and forced migration. Impact to the health system (and community) Clinical treatment needs arising from the region's high burden of chronic disease are being exacerbated by climate impacts, amplifying social and environmental health inequities. This increases pressure on the already stressed clinical services. Health service infrastructure at climate- risk includes jetties, airports, roads and telecommunications relied upon by staff and patients for frequent travel between Queensland Health Service facilities on the islands and across the region. Ella Kris from the Torres Strait Regional Council said \"even the hospital on Thursday Island, it's built right on the edge of the sea. In time to come, the water is going to be at the hospital's front door.\" 60KEy FinDings Torres Strait: Rising Sea Levels, Culture, Identity and Health Mental health and cultural impacts are severe. For Indigenous Australians, health is more than individual physical wellbeing, and includes the social, emotional and cultural well-being of the whole Community.156 In 2019, coastal erosion and king tides washed away ancestral graves on Masig Island. Traditional Owner Yessie Mosby said his community had grown increasingly fearful of being forced to leave their island homes.157 He said \"That's our history and to lose that we lose our identity...We didn't contribute anything to what's happening, but we're on the front line.\" John Rainbird from the Torres Strait Regional Authority notes additional health concerns, saying: \"Sea level is a big stress factor for people whose communities may be at risk. But it also has other impacts. The waste treatment plants often have to be shut down because salt water gets into the system...raw sewage is pumped out, normally just onto the waterway in front of the community. That creates a health risk as well...Some of the landfill sites get flooded in the low lying communities and then you get health risks with mosquito issues and leaching into groundwater.\"Health system response In 2019, twenty-three medical professionals working in the Queensland government's Torres and Cape Health and Hospital Service region made an emergency call for increased attention to climate change and health impacts on Torres Strait Islander peoples.158 Calling for rapid transition to a low carbon economy, and greater investment in primary preventative healthcare, Dr Ineke Wever said: \"We need to prepare our community to be as healthy as possible for the coming changes and reduce the amount of chronic disease we take with us into the future.\" Five years ago in 2016, health personnel contributed to the collaborative development of the Torres Strait Regional Adaptation and Resilience Plan. Development of this innovative, forward-looking plan was led by the Torres Strait Regional Authority, with local and state government partners and community workshops. It took an integrated climate change risk and vulnerability assessment approach across the Natural, Financial, Human, Social and Physical capitals. It put forward a holistic pathway of actions that could be undertaken over coming years, both to build community resilience, and to adapt to climate impacts.159 Torres Strait Islander Researchers' Community of Practice Meriba buay-ngalpan wackaythoemamy, commended the Regional Adaptation and Resilience Plan as a significant way forward and an opportunity to establish a Torres Strait Islander-driven agenda to inform climate change policy and practice at all government levels. They lament that despite this work, programs that address health and wellbeing in a holistic sense are still not in place.160 Sea level is a big stress factor for people whose communities may be at risk.\"61KEy FinDings Torres Strait: Rising Sea Levels, Culture, Identity and Health Lessons and implications A culturally safe and holistic approach that is community-led and addresses the cultural, social and ecological determinants of health is needed. Continuing support and resourcing is needed to implement community- and systems-informed plans such as the Torres Strait Regional Adaptation and Resilience Plan. Indigenous researchers say \"Securing a better future for Torres Strait Islanders requires sustained commitment....and importantly, stable financial support. The current short-term funding environment is misaligned with the type of longer- term partnership required to properly address positive health for the Torres Strait.\"160 Addressing health and wellbeing in a holistic sense includes working towards shared cultural and wellbeing goals with other sectors and services. This requires better coordination and collaboration between agencies. To strengthen the healthcare system, the wellness promotion end of the healthcare continuum needs to be equally prioritised and resourced in balance with treatment and care. Securing a better future for Torres Strait Islanders requires sustained commitment...and importantly stable financial support.\"62KEy FinDings Western Sydney, NSW: Extreme Heat Context Extreme heat is particularly severe in Western Sydney where geography and weather patterns intensify the Urban Heat Island effect, trapping hot air in the region. In January 2020, Penrith was the hottest place on Earth at 48.9C and in 2019 Parramatta sweltered through 47 days with temperatures over 35C. Chief Executive of Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils, Charles Casucelli said \"this is a liveability issue. It's not about being comfortable, it's about asking if I can or can't live in Western Sydney.\"161 Western Sydney is also one of the fastest growing urban populations in Australia with more than 2.5 million residents, who are typically of a lower socio-economic background. Sleep, school, and work are already being impacted. However, heat also has a \"domino effect\" on peoples' health which increases the health inequality gap already seen in Sydney's west. Living in warm neighbourhoods increases the heat-related mortality risks of residents by nearly 6% compared to those living in cooler suburbs, and older people are particularly vulnerable.162 Riverstone General Practitioner Dr Kim Loo says she has a sense of dread about the days of forecast high temperatures. She is concerned vulnerable people will not be able to manage their health during heatwaves. Dr Loo says a lot of people who've lost their jobs due to the pandemic have moved back home to Western Sydney and are now living in multi generation, low-income homes that are not thermally efficient. She said: \"many of my patients cannot afford it [air conditioning]\" and \"people are forced to choose to go without food or medications in order to be cooler, or they will buy food and medications and not be (cool enough)\" .Heat has significant detrimental impacts on young children which can have lifelong impacts. Being outside in nature or parks is important for children's healthy development. Dr Sebastian Pfautsch, Associate Professor of Urban Studies at Western Sydney University said \"playgrounds at public parks may be children's only regular access to nature. It's the place where kids' gross motor activities take place\" . However, Dr Pfautsch regularly logs surface temperatures upwards of 80C and says play equipment can be hot enough to sear skin. He said \"...we need [playgrounds] to help these new citizens become Earth stewards...but we're seeing a shift indoors\"161. Parents also justifiably worry their kids won't do well at school when they're exhausted after not sleeping well on hot nights. The COVID-19 crisis has hit Western Sydney hard in 2021, but the community is already worrying about this year's expected high summer temperatures, with the added pressure of the pandemic. Dr Loo said, \"there's so much anxiety in the Community at the moment\" . Image credit: Climate Council63KEy FinDings Western Sydney, NSW: Extreme Heat Impact to the health system A community-based project called Sweltering Cities surveyed 700 residents about what it's like to live, work and travel around Western Sydney on days of extreme heat. The survey found that 11.2% of people have been to a doctor or sought medical care because they felt unwell in the heat. In addition to this 23.5% of people have a health condition made worse by extreme heat and yet 31.4% of people said that they did not have access to information on how to be safe and well in heat waves.163 This is reflected within the health system, with hospital admissions and rates of morbidity and mortality increasing well above the norm after two to three extremely hot nights. This includes significant increases in mental health-related mortality and morbidity during heatwave days. Health system response \"As a doctor you feel like there's only so much you can do in primary care when the environment around you is fundamentally changing,\" says Dr Loo, who foresees a future of rapidly escalating health costs due to summer heat. Resilience Sydney's Beck Dawson believes Western Sydney will remain habitable, but people will have to live there in very different ways from how they live now. She suggests a daily heat-risk rating system, similar to the one used for bushfires, could be introduced. \"When we get to extreme heat, we have to respond as if it's an emergency,\" she says.164 Solutions required go far beyond the capacity of the health system. Local councils and community organisations have begun working together to better plan for heat. The Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils' Turn Down the Heat Strategy was developed by 55 organisations working together to create cooler, more resilient communities.165 Emma Bacon, the Founder and Coordinator of Sweltering Cities envisages large scale solar installations on affordable housing, public housing and low-income housing, to power the necessary air conditioning, as part of the solution. Lessons and implications The impacts described in this Case Study are beyond the health system's capacity to treat and require comprehensive, multisectoral and \"radical\" solutions. This includes collaboration between the health system, developers, urban planners and different levels of government. The Sweltering Cities community survey also identified four categories of heat responses needed. These relate to more thermally efficient homes; public infrastructure including cooling centres; better emergency services during heatwaves; and justice for residents through having a greater say in creating a sustainable, climate-smart city.163 Comprehensive adaptation strategies are needed now to maintain liveability in Western Sydney. In addition to this, timely, locally relevant data on the impacts of current and projected heat on Western Sydney residents is required to more accurately quantify health impacts from heat. Western Sydney is a glimpse into the future for the rest of urban Australia, without assertive transformational mitigation and adaptation strategies at local and national levels.64KEy FinDings National: Mental Health Workshops for Rural and Remote Health Workers in Bushfire Affected Areas Context Rural and remote health practitioners in areas affected by the widespread 2019-20 bushfires across Australia have been through the same traumas and challenges as their patients, and haven't been able to take a break to look after their own wellbeing.166 With high levels of stress and exhaustion in the health workforce, they feel they've been forgotten. Impact to the health system Mary Jackson, a Mental Health and Wellbeing educator at CRANAplus said, \"many are still struggling to get back into their own homes after the bushfires. Services are struggling to get their workforce back on track, and COVID's taken over the agenda.\" The need for support was clear to Kristy Hill and Ms Jackson of CRANAplus, the peak professional body for the remote and isolated health workforce in Australia. Even before COVID-19 and the bushfires, the pair indicated that health professionals felt they were working in a 'broken' system, and were now being asked to take on a lot of extra work and extra caseloads. Ms Jackson said, \"one organization told us their workforce were like zombies.... lots of sick leave, and people just not being able to function at work.\" Health system response CRANAplus developed a range of mental health, wellbeing and self-care workshops and resources including webinars and podcasts. In all, 61 workshops have been delivered to 815 health professionals, reaching all states and territories following the 2019-2020 bushfires. When possible, workshops were delivered face- to-face by state-based CRANAplus educators. Emergent priorities such as COVID outbreaks impacted workshop delivery, particularly for Indigenous organisations. However, flexible virtual modes of delivery enabled access, when, and how, participants were ready and able to attend, sometimes at very short notice. Initially it was hard for health workers to step out of their caring roles and to understand that the workshops were being offered for their own mental health, not their clients'. However, attendance numbers grew steadily as workshops were rolled out in different regions. One participant wrote: \" It has been a tough year from fires to COVID. Earlier in the year...I probably wouldn't have been able to take in your recommendations, but now....your workshop ideas have helped. I now know I need to look after myself, which will help all around me.\" Image credit: CRANAplus65KEy FinDings National: Mental Health Workshops for Rural and Remote Health Workers in Bushfire Affected Areas Some organisations reported that the message about staff mental health and self-care needed to come from a trusted external source, not from their employers. Ms Hill, the Education and Resource Lead at CRANAplus credits the fact that CRANAplus staff have shared experience of droughts and bushfires and understand the impact on communities. On healthcare system readiness for climate change impacts, Ms Hill said, \"Certainly on the ground level it feels like the system is not ready for any more disasters. It really needs high level strategic input to be able to support people on the ground, to even consider that conversation\". The bushfires prompted people to make the connection between climate change and health, but \"it's just been put on the back burner because of COVID\" said Ms Jackson. However, Ms Hill and Ms Jackson both believe that rural health practitioners can be good advocates to help lead community climate change preparation and adaptation. \"In rural areas where they're really connected to the country, and have a better understanding of the connection between the environment and health, there's a real opportunity to engage with them, to have strategies that empower health workers in the rural health workforce to put it [climate change] on the agenda, and to work with communities to look at how they can adapt and prepare\".Lessons and implications Rural and remote health practitioners have been under prolonged stress along with the communities they serve and show signs of exhaustion and burnout. In providing valuable, effective mental health support to healthcare providers, important factors include the authenticity, flexibility and responsiveness of the messenger. The health system is deeply under-prepared. To build health system capacity and resilience to climate change will require significant, sustained strategic leadership, governance, guidance, training and resources. Rural and remote health practitioners can be engaged and empowered to help their communities understand and build resilience to climate health impacts. In rural areas where they're really connected to the country...there's a real opportunity... to work with communities to look at how they can adapt and prepare.\"66KEy FinDings Queensland: 'Stepped Care' and Partnerships for Mental Health After Disasters Context Unacceptable rates of rural suicide during the millennium drought led Queensland Health to establish a rural mental health support scheme to provide a more comprehensive approach to tackling mental health issues in disaster-affected rural communities.167 Despite recent rains, 65% of Queensland is still drought declared,168 and for many farmers there is \"no water, no growth, and no end in sight\". Queensland communities continue to struggle with the physical and psychological impacts of drought, overlaid by the impacts of severe cyclones, bushfires, and monsoonal flooding. Communities are now further impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Impact to the health system Primary health clinicians have seen an increase in complex, trauma-related mental health presentations linked to repeated severe weather events and other disasters, including the pandemic. Already struggling to recruit skilled mental health practitioners, and with high staff turnover rates in remote areas, mental health clinicians say their workforce has no \"surge capacity\" to deploy in response to disasters. But climate-related trauma will only continue to grow. COVID-19 has further significantly disrupted recruitment and service delivery. Dr Andrea Baldwin, Clinical Consultant, Child and Youth Mental Health Service, says child and youth mental health clinicians also saw a sharp increase in babies and children with emotional and behavioural disturbances linked to extreme weather events. Children require age- appropriate mental health treatment, but existing clinical capacity could not address the needs of every affected child and family experiencing distress, especially in rural, remote and isolated areas. Clinicians recognised new resources and services were needed to meet increasing community-wide needs. Health system response Set up under joint Commonwealth and State disaster arrangements, the Queensland Mental Health Disaster Recovery Program (MHDR) provides funding for two years' mental health support in officially disaster-declared locations. Queensland Health MHDR Manager Ben Norris says the program has been in \"constant response and recovery mode\" since it began in 2015. The support, for both adults and children, is delivered by small teams comprising psychologists, social workers, occupational therapists, and mental health nurses, and facilitated by staff with community engagement and development skills and local peer workers. MHDR Manager, Mr Norris says different types of care are needed along the pathway towards recovery, so a 'stepped care' model Illustrations from a book written as part of the Birdie's Tree Visiting Program. In group story-making workshops, a Birdie story is used as a model, and the children then create their own story about someone getting through a hard time with help from those around them.67KEy FinDings Queensland: 'Stepped Care' and Partnerships for Mental Health After Disasters aims to connect people to \"the right care at the right time\". This starts with low intensity psychological interventions and moves up to more advanced trauma-specific treatment where needed. The initial response phase is about psychological first aid for highly aroused, distressed people, to help them feel safe and connected. It fosters self-reliance so they don't 'get stuck' in a state of helplessness. Then, the 'restoration and recovery' phase aims to build mental health awareness and capacity in the community. It helps people recognise danger signs to look out for, such as sleep issues, prolonged anxiety and stress, being angry a lot of the time, and increased use of alcohol and other drugs, and encourages them to access available help. As used by Child and Youth Mental Health clinicians through the program, the 'stepped' care approach includes a growing suite of practical and appealing Birdie's Tree resources169 developed to help families prepare for, cope with, and recover from extreme weather events. Progressive care levels include screening (in schools and kindergartens), early intervention, a diagnostic assessment, and trauma treatment. The Queensland Centre for Perinatal and Infant Mental Health (QCPIMH) is working on the best way to roll out each of these steps and recognises that partnerships are key. Dr Baldwin said, \"we call it upskilling the informal front line. Building the capacity of anyone who has a role in helping children to get back on track. There are ways that they can use the Birdie's Tree resources to help\" .Mr Norris said, \"one of the key lessons between Cyclone Debbie and the Queensland bushfires was that people just don't turn up to get treatment for mental health services after a disaster. You actively have to...encourage them to seek help\" . Key to this is building trust between the mental health team and community. Experience shows employing 'peer workers' or trusted local figures in the team, is vital. In areas where there are culturally and linguistically diverse groups impacted by an event, teams employ people who can speak the languages. MHDR teams also work closely with existing health services and other local agencies such as Lifeline, Red Cross, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, and the Royal Flying Doctor Service. Finally, the program also provides grants and projects to build overall community resilience aimed at better preparing individuals and communities to deal with current and future climate risk events. This is 'Jeff and the Cyclone' by a group of Year 2 students at Hermit Park State School in Townsville \u2014 an area impacted by the monsoonal floods of 2019, with a long history of cyclones.68KEy FinDings Queensland: 'Stepped Care' and Partnerships for Mental Health After Disasters Lessons and implications New approaches to mental health are needed to address the growing impact of climate-related distress and trauma, recognising that \"the new normal\" will be increasingly risky. There needs to be significantly more investment in building preparedness and capacity to adapt to ongoing climate change, in both the community and the health system, to better balance the prevalent reactive emphasis on treatment and restoration. The 'stepped' approach modelled by this MHDR Program is one example of an emerging model of care. Establishing and maintaining MHDR support in affected communities is often delayed by recruitment challenges and exacerbated by high staff turnover rates in remote areas. MHDR Program leads grapple with the pros and cons of bringing in \"outside experts\" following disaster. While grateful for the much-needed intermittent funding and opportunity to boost services, they argue that permanent funding for new positions, rather than temporary support is needed.Key to program success is inclusion of trusted local community members as \"peer workers\" who can bridge community and service provision, and ensure need is matched to appropriate care. Partnerships and collaboration are vital for success, but some communities are still hard to reach, including remote and isolated, Indigenous communities, migrant and refugee families, and families with parents or children with disabilities. Mr Norris said the more serious clinical need tends to show up late in the two-year funding cycle. Except for recurrent funding, three years of more flexibly staged funding would better match community needs. Children and young people need to be understood and treated differently from adults. Upskilling the informal front line, or building the evidence-based capacity of all kinds of people who come into contact with children, is the foundation for success. Another illustration from 'Jeff and the Cyclone'.Economic Analysis 70EConomiC An ALysis 70Aim The present analysis sought to estimate the burden of bushfires in Australia over ten years from 2021 to 2030 inclusive, in terms of: \u008fDeaths directly caused by bushfires and attributable to bushfire-related smoke; \u008fYears of life lost to bushfires; \u008fHealthcare costs associated with hospital presentations due to bushfire-related smoke; \u008fBroader economic costs of the bushfires; and \u008fValue of statistical life lost to bushfires These figures provide the basis upon which the cost- effectiveness of interventions to reduce the health burden from future bushfires can be evaluated.Methods Model A dynamic model with yearly cycles was constructed to simulate follow-up of the entire Australian population over the ten years from 2021 to 2030. The model tracked the number of deaths occurring in each of the ten years, as well as the total years of life lived by the whole cohort. The dynamic nature of the model meant that the population was updated each year by taking into account births, deaths and net inward migration. The methods used for dynamic modelling have been published.170 (Note: the model is generic and can be adapted to evaluate the health and economic burden of any events related to climate change.) Data sources: demographics and mortality The model population was profiled on the Australian population in 2020, stratified by sex and age in single years, as published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).171 This 2020 population represented the model population in the year before the baseline year of 2021. To estimate the numbers of people in each sex-and-age stratum from 2021 onwards, Economic Analysis71EConomiC An ALysis the 2020 population was evolved, taking into account expected births, deaths and numbers of net immigrants each year. To estimate the number of deaths occurring each year, the numbers of people in each sex-and-age stratum were multiplied by relevant sex-and-age specific risks of death (from all causes). The latter were estimated using mortality data from 2019, the latest year for which data were available.171 It was assumed that across the entire time horizon of the model, sex-and- age specific risks of death would remain constant. (For example, the annual risk of death for 70 year-old males will stay the same in all 10 years.) Future numbers of births, as well as net inward migrations within each sex-and-age stratum, were based on estimates published by the ABS.172 The ABS provided three sets of figures for births and net inward migrations: low, medium and high estimates. Medium estimates were used in the model.Data sources: health burden due to bushfires Borchers-Arriagada et al143 estimated the number of deaths attributable to the 2019-2020 bushfires in Australia arising from smoke-related conditions. These were in addition to the 33 deaths directly caused by the fire. The authors also estimated the number of cardiovascular and respiratory hospitalisations, and presentations to hospital emergency departments for asthma, attributable to the fire. These are summarised in Figure 1, which is a reproduction of a table in the publication by Borchers- Arriagada.143 Although this estimate covers eastern Australia, it is the most robust data available to support this modelling which is Australia-wide. The data presented in Figure 1 were used as a reference for estimating the health burden associated with future Australian bushfires in the model. Figure 1. Estimated health burden attributable to bushfire smoke, QLD, NSW, ACT and VIC. 1 Oct 2019-10 Feb 2020 Estimate number of cases (95% confidence intervals) Outcome QLD NSW ACT VIC TOTAL Excess deaths (any cause)47 (17-77) 219 (81-357) 31 each year from 2021 to 2030 inclusive, it was assumed that there would be one bushfire of varying relative magnitude as the 2019-2020 bushfires in Australia, in recognition of the fact that this was a significant event. Professor David Karoly, Chief Research Scientist and the CSIRO Climate Science Centre, estimated that over the ten-year period from 2021 to 2030, there would be \"one year with impacts like 2019-2020, three years with impacts 50% the scale of 2019-20, five years with impacts 10% the scale of 2019-20, and one year with 2% impact... (to represent the wet spring-summers like this year ...)\" (personal communication, 12 November 2021). Therefore, over the ten years from 2021 to 2030, the health burden per capita was assumed to exert an impact that was either 2% (one year), 10% (five years), 50% (three years) or 100% (one year) of the 2019-2020 bushfires. The specific years in which these relative impacts occurred were selected randomly. After adjustment for the impact relative to the reference 2019-2020 bushfire, the burden was then proportionally up-adjusted by the size of the population in each year relative to the population in 2020. In a sensitivity analysis (see below), the magnitude of future bushfires was assumed to be the same as the 2019-2020 events. To estimate the number of bushfire-related deaths in each year, the risk of such a death for each sex-and- age stratum was multiplied by the number of people in the relevant stratum. The risk was calculated by dividing half the total number of deaths in the 2019- 2020 bushfires (total 450, 33 direct and 417 smoke- related) by the total population in 2020 (25,693,342), which equated to 0.000876%. It was assumed that the risk of dying due to a bushfire was the same across both sexes and all ages. To estimate the number of hospitalisations for cardiovascular and respiratory conditions and emergency department presentations for asthma, the estimated numbers in 2019-2020 were first halved, and then adjusted by the size of the population in each year relative to the population in 2020. For example, in 2019-2020, there were 1124 cardiovascular hospitalisations. In 2021, the estimated total population was 26,117,572. Hence the bushfire that would occur in 2021 was assumed to lead to 571 cardiovascular hospitalisations. The model did not estimate the health burden of bushfire smoke due to non-physical conditions, such as mental health, nor the burden borne by community- based healthcare services. Furthermore, the opportunity costs of devoting healthcare resources away from other conditions were not considered. Hence overall, the model's estimates of the health burden of bushfires were very conservative. Data sources: costs of hospitalisations The unit costs of hospitalisations for cardiovascular and respiratory conditions were estimated from data pertaining to relevant diagnostic related groups (DRGs) contained in the National Hospital Cost Data Collection, Round 22, 2017-18 (173), the latest available. Cardiovascular-related DRGs have the prefix F, and respiratory DRGs have the prefix E. B70B, were also included. Weighting by the number of separations for each DRG, the weighted-average cost for cardiovascular (including stroke) DRGs was $6830. Using the health price index published by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in 2019 (174), this value was updated to a 2021 value of $7175. The weighted- average cost for respiratory DRGs was $6357, which was updated to a 2021 value of $6679. Data sources: healthcare costs of deaths The healthcare costs of each death occurring directly due to bushfires was assumed to be zero, based on the conservative assumption that health services would not be used by affected individuals. The cost of each death attributable to smoke-related conditions was assumed to be the weighted-average of all cardiovascular (including stroke) and respiratory DRGs. This was $6637, which was updated to a 2021 value of $6973. 73EConomiC An ALysis Data sources: broader economic cost of bushfires In 2020, a report by SGS Economics and Planning (175) estimated the impact of the 2019-2020 bushfires on the gross domestic product of the three affected local government areas (LGAs): East Gippsland, Victoria ($1,466 million), Kangaroo Island, South Australia ($234 million) and Wingecarribee, NSW ($2,226 million). The total was $3,926 million. With each bushfire (of half the magnitude as the 2019-2020 events), its broader economic cost was first considered to be half of that if the 2019-2020 events, and then proportionally up-adjusted by the size of the population in each year relative to the population in 2020. Given the uncertainty regarding inflation in the current economic climate, GDP was not inflated over the time horizon. However, this was likely a conservative assumption. The analysis was also conservative in not considering the impact of bushfires on the GDP of other areas outside of bushfire-affected LGAs. In reality, there would significant compounding effects on the broader economy. Researchers from the Australian National University estimated that the total economic costs of the 2009 Victorian Black Saturday fires, the insurance costs of which were similar to the 2019-2020 bushfires, might have reached $7.4 billion (2019 dollars) (176). Data sources: value of statistical life In 2021, the Office of Best Practice Regulation from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet assigned the value of statistical life year at $222,000.177 This is the value in monetary terms that is ascribed to each year lived by an Australian and used to help with public policy and planning. As with GDP, this value was also not inflated over time, which was likely conservative.Calculating years of life lived and lost Calculation of the years of life lived in any year by people within a sex-and-age stratum was based on the following formula: tx = (nx-1+nx)/2 where: tx = time spent alive in a sex-and-age stratum during year x nx-1 = number of people residing in that stratum at the start of year x nx = number of people residing in that stratum at the end of year x Implicit in the formula was the assumption that any transition into and out of that stratum occurred halfway through cycle x. Years of life lost to bushfire-related deaths were calculated by creating a cohort of individuals who died, and simulating their follow-up as if they had not died due to bushfires. Rather, they experienced sex-and-age specific mortality as per the general population. The value of statistical life lost was derived from multiplying each year of life lost by the value of statistical life year ($222,000). Discounting A 5% annual discount rate was applied to all costs incurred and life years lived from 2022 onwards. In economic evaluations, discounting takes into account the fact that the value of goods and services are progressively reduced the further into the future they are consumed. A 5% annual discount rate was selected based on current Australian guidelines.17874EConomiC An ALysis Annual discounting was applied according to the formula: XD = XU * [1/(1+d)]^t where: XD = discounted value XU = undiscounted value d = annual discount rate t = time elapsed in years since 2021 Sensitivity analyses Two one-way sensitivity analyses were undertaken, with variation to the following key input variables (while other inputs remained at 'base case' values): 1. In each year of the model, the relative impact of bushfires was assumed to be 100% of that of the 2019-2020 bushfires. This variation assumed that future bushfires on average would as impactful as the 2019-2020 events (compared to the base case assumption of bushfires having half the impact). 2. The estimated impact of a bushfire equivalent to that of the 2019-2020 bushfires on the Australian gross domestic product was increased to $7,000 million. Results Future burden of bushfires in Australia The results of the modelled analysis are summarised in Table 3. Over the ten years from 2021 to 2030 inclusive, the modelled analysis predicted that 1,480 lives would be lost to bushfires, as well as 4,024 years of life (discounted). (Note that in each successive year, the years of life lost increased because the cohort of people who died as a consequence of bushfires increased over time. For example, in 2022, years of life were lost by the 46 people who died prematurely in that year as well as the 45 people who died prematurely in 2021.) Healthcare costs arising from deaths for smoke- related conditions, hospitalisations for cardiovascular and respiratory conditions, and emergency department presentations with asthma amounted to $69 million (discounted). The impact on gross domestic product totalled $10 billion (discounted). In terms of value of statistical life, $893 million (discounted) was lost. Table 3.

Table 4. Results of the sensitivity analyses DeathsHealthcare costs*Impact on GDP* Years of $69,114,039 at 5% annually from 2022 onwards GDP = gross domestic product, VoSL = value of statistical life Cost-effectiveness of interventions to reduce health burden from bushfires There are many interventions to reduce the risk or impact of bushfires on health. Furthermore, these interventions have variable effectiveness that are challenging to measure. Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these interventions accurately. However, the above figures provide useful context for decisions to invest in such interventions. For example, based on the conservative assumption that bushfires will cost the broader Australian economy $10 billion (discounted) over the next ten years, any amount of expenditure on bushfire interventions less than this would still be cost-saving, assuming that they are 100% effective (which is very unlikely). If the interventions were expected to reduce the impact of bushfires on health by 10%, then up to $1 billion could be invested. Of course, wider benefits to the healthcare system, human health and the health of the environment need also to be considered.76REFEREnCEs 1 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Literature review This comprises a short, critical scoping review, using a semi-systematic, snowball technique to find 'press and policy' material (i.e. media reports, government policy, official reports, public submissions, stakeholder commentaries, corporate reports, etc.), as well as relevant scholarly works. NB: Given resource limits, this will exclude social media, except on expert advice. High-level analysis of climate-health policy performance began with the CAHA National Framework and The RACP policy. Other 'thought leaders' used include the MJA-Lancet Countdown, Health Care Without Harm, Charlesworth et al. (2018), the Grattan Institute, Climate Action Tracker, etc. Together with carbon footprint analyses, these helped identify key stakeholders and additional documents. Texts on qualitative and political economy analysis guided methods. Social media was excluded. In all, around 300 documents were used. Semi-structured interviews Invitations to interviews were accompanied by an explanatory statement and consent form, in accordance with Monash University's ethics procedures. Care was taken to retain the confidence of each informant, including anonymizing their views and being sensitive to any risks to their position from participation. This helps to reduce messenger bias, encourages open discussion, and improves the quality of data collected. Semi-structured interviews were used to allow informants some latitude and freedom to talk about what is of interest or importance to them, making room for the conversation to go in unexpected directions, rather than the interviewer presuming to know all salient questions a priori.109APPEnDix 6 Sampling 16 informants were selected based on internal expert advice, the literature review, and on the advice of other informants.

A semi-structured approach to the interviews allowed both interviewer and interviewee considerable flexibility. This made it possible to tailor the order and follow-up questions to the informant's particular expertise. Although this was minimized, it quite possibly influenced responses. Conversely, the technique allows (and deliberately so) informants to take conversations in directions that interested them. Informant selection was guided, initially, by advice by experts at The RACP, CAHA, and MSDI, as well as the chapter author's own initiative. While we endeavoured to recruit a balanced mix of people with expertise on health systems around the country, state and federal, and from the public, research, private, and community sectors \u2014 and across clinical, service, and policymaking levels \u2014 we were ultimately constrained by time and informants' availability. Naturally, a surge in cases of COVID-19 also affected recruitment. While we gave a firm assurance to keep informants' identity confidential, we were unable to speak to more than one serving, senior Commonwealth official.
