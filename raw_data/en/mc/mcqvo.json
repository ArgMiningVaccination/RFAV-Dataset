However, antigenic drift is likely to occur in the future in response to increasingpopulation immunity induced by infection or vaccination. In this study, sequential passaging of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus bycontact transmission through two independent series of suboptimally vaccinated ferrets resulted in selection of variant viruses with an amino acid substitution (N156K, H1 numbering without signal peptide; N159K, H3 peptide; N173K, H1 numbering from first methionine) in a known antigenic site of the viral HA. The N156K HA variantreplicated and transmitted efficiently between na \u00a8ve ferrets and outgrew wildtype virus in vivo in ferrets in the presence and absence of immune pressure. In vitro , in a range of cell culture systems, the N156K variant rapidly adapted, acquiring additional mutations in the viral HA that also potentially affected antigenic properties. The N156K escape mutant wasantigenically distinct from wildtype virus as shown by binding of HA-specific antibodies. Glycan binding assaysdemonstrated the N156K escape mutant had altered receptor binding preferences compared to wildtype virus, which was supported by computational modeling predictions. The N156K substitution, and culture adaptations, have been detected in human A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses with N156K preferentially reported in sequences from original clinical samples rather thancultured isolates. This study demonstrates the ability of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus to undergo rapid antigenic change toevade a low level vaccine response, while remaining fit in a ferret transmission model of immunization and infection. Furthermore, the potential changes in receptor binding properties that accompany antigenic changes highlight the importance of routine characterization of clinical samples in human A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza surveillance.

Surveillance of circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses has revealed some genetic variation in the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), but no significant antigenic changes have occurred over the past four years [2]. Moreover, the most recent circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses remain antigenically closely related to the 2009 vaccine strain, A/California/7/2009 [3]. Serological studies estimated that during the first wave of infectionin 2009, 34-43% of school-aged children and about 10% of adults were infected by A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses [4]. This level of natural exposure, combined with extensive vaccination and the ongoing circulation of these viruses since 2009, has established widespread immunity against the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in the human population. Influenza A viruses undergo continuous antigenic variation, ensuring efficient replication in the human host in the face of previous vaccination and/or infection (reviewed in [5]). Antigenic drift involves amino acid changes in antigenic regions of influenza proteins, facilitating escape from existing immunity. Drift muta- tions most commonly occur in the gene encoding the HA surface PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 1 May 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 5 | e1003354glycoprotein, which is the major target of neutralizing antibodies elicited as a result of vaccination and/or natural infection. Mutations are typically localized to antigenic sites surroundingthe receptor binding site on the globular head of HA ([6-10], reviewed in [11]), consistent with the critical role of HA in binding to cell-surface receptors to initiate infection of respiratory epithelialcells. A limited number of in vivo and in vitro studies have attempted to select influenza virus mutants in the presence of neutralizingantibodies [12-16]. A(H1N1), A(H3N8) and A(H3N2) viruses have been passaged multiple times through immunized mice [13] and once through dogs [14] and guinea pigs [17], respectively.A(H1N1)pdm09 virus has been cultured in embryonated hen's eggs in the presence of mouse monoclonal antibodies [16] or in MDCK cells in the presence of a human monoclonal antibody[15]. Resulting 'immune escape mutants' often express mutations that are closely linked with changes in HA receptor binding specificity and avidity for cell surface receptors [13,16]. Immune pressure has also been shown to affect viral diversity [14,18]. The selection of immune escape mutants in the presence of neutralizingantibodies has been proposed as a major factor driving evolution of HA in human influenza viruses. Early models proposed that passage of virus through individuals with different antibodyspecificities may induce sequential changes in antigenic regions, resulting in antigenic drift [19,20]. More recently it has been postulated that alteration in the HA binding avidity for cell surfacereceptors drives antigenic drift and can occur independently, or, alongside variation in antigenicity as virus is passaged alternately through partially immune and na \u00a8ve individuals [13]. Epithelial cells lining the airways of humans and ferrets express a similar pattern of sialylated receptors, enabling human influenza viruses to infect ferrets directly [21]. Following influenza infection,ferrets display similar disease symptoms and pathology to those observed in humans [22,23]. Multiple immunizations with human influenza vaccines and adjuvant can protect ferrets fromsubsequent upper respiratory tract challenge with influenza virus [24]. In the absence of adjuvant, immunization with humaninfluenza vaccine does not result in sterilizing immunity but significantly reduces viral load in the lower respiratory tract [25].Serum from influenza-infected ferrets is commonly used in surveillance to assess antigenicity of influenza viruses circulating in the human population [26]. In this study, an A(H1N1)pdm09 virus A/Tasmania/2004/2009 was passaged human A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccineand adjuvant. An antigenic escape mutant with altered receptor binding specificity emerged in two independent experiments. This escape mutant, which has also been detected in human surveillance studies, was difficult to detect and isolate using conventional in vitro methods. Results A(H1N1)pdm09 virus can transmit between ferrets in the presence of specific antibodies A model of influenza transmission under immune pressure was established by suboptimal immunization of ferrets with the human monovalent A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza vaccine with adjuvant (MIV +IFA) or vaccine alone (MIV). A single immunization of human influenza vaccine with adjuvant does not induce sterilizing immunity in ferrets ([24] and data not shown). All animalsimmunized once with MIV had HI titres $40 (GMT 10) ( Table 1 ). In preliminary experiments, we established that the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus A/Tasmania/2004/2009 was antigenically indistinguishable from the vaccine strain A/California/7/2009 by HI assay and grew to high titres in both the upper and lower respiratory tract of na \u00a8ve ferrets (data not shown). Although gene sequencing detected five amino acid differences between the HA were in the major antigenic regions. Amino acids in HA are referenced using H1 numbering without the signal peptide [27] in this manuscript. We examined transmission of A/Tasmania/2004/2009 intranasal inoculation of na \u00a8ve +IFA (Figure 1 andFigure S1 ). In each passage line, we examined seven transmission events and confirmed effective transmission by detection of virus in nasal washes as described in Materials and Methods. Contact transmission failed twice for both MIV +IFA passage lines ( Figure 1 andFigure S1 ). In the first instance this could be attributed to difficulty in detecting shed virus using an influenza rapid test ( Figure 1 R1-R2(1); Figure S1 R0-R1(1)), so virus shedding in this group was subsequently assayed by daily real time RT-PCR. Transmission was restarted artificially by direct intranasal inoculation of a new recipient ferret with the nasal wash from the previously infected ferret. The second transmission failure (R5-R6(1)), detected using real time RT-PCR, was not due to high immunization antibody titre (data not shown) and transmission was also restarted as described. The virus kinetics in all passage lines was assessed using real time RT-PCR to determine the relative copy number. There was no difference in the peak viral load achieved in naturally infected ferrets from any of the groups ( Figure 2A ). However growth rate of virus in the ferrets from the MIV +IFA passage lines was significantly lower compared to na ( p,0.001 respectively). The growth rate of virus in the ferrets from the MIV passage line wasAuthor Summary Infection with influenza virus leads to significant morbidity and mortality. Annual vaccination may prevent subse- quent disease by inducing neutralizing antibodies to currently circulating strains in the human population. Toescape this antibody response, influenza A viruses under-go continuous genetic variation as they replicate, enabling viruses with advantageous antigenic mutations to spread and cause disease in na \u00a8ve or previously immune or vaccinated individuals. To date, the 2009 pandemic virus(A(H1N1)pdm09) has not undergone significant antigenic drift, with the result that the vaccine remains well-matched and should provide good protection to A(H1N1)pdm09circulating viruses. In this study, we induced antigenic drift in an A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in the ferret model. A single amino acid mutation emerged in the dominant surfaceglycoprotein, hemagglutinin, which had a multifacetedeffect, altering both antigenicity and virus receptor specificity. The mutant virus could not be isolated using routine cell culture methods without the virus acquiringadditional amino acid changes, yet was fit in vivo . The implications for surveillance of circulating influenza virus are significant as current assays commonly used to assess vaccine mismatch, as well as to produce isolates forvaccine manufacture, are biased against identification ofviruses containing only this mutation.Antigenic Drift of A(H1N1)pdm09 Virus in Ferrets PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 2 May 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 5 | e1003354also significantly lower compared to the 2B ). The time between transmission events (serial interval) was longer for the MIV +IFA line (5.3 days) compared to all other lines (na \u00a8ve 3.6 days ( p = 0.001 ); PBS +IFA 3.8 days (p = 0.010 ); MIV 3.9 days ( p = 0.011 )) (Figure 2C ). Within each passage line, there was no significant change in any of the kineticsmeasurements as passaging progressed, suggesting that the growthcharacteristics and transmissibility of the virus remained stableover time (data not shown). Emergence and persistence of a mutation in the HA1 protein in a known antigenic site following passaging of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in immunized ferrets RNA was extracted from nasal wash samples from the peak day of virus shedding and infection (as determined by real time RT-PCR) for genetic analysis. Once a mutation appeared in the HA orNA proteins from a ferret of any passage line, it persisted and wastransmitted to all subsequent HA at residues 191 (L191I) and 223 (R223Q) ( Table 2 ). The same mutations were also detected following passage of another egg-grownA(H1N1)pdm09 virus (A/Auckland/1/2009) in ferrets (data notshown). Of interest, mutations that alter residues 191 and 223 havebeen associated with host specificity and receptor binding [28,29]. Additional mutations that became fixed in the HA protein were specific to each passage line. Mutations arose in the na \u00a8ve passage lines (G131S, D187E, Table 2 ) and in the MIV passage line (D187V, Table 2 ). G131S creates a potential glycosylation site and D187 has been associated with host specificity [30,31]. TheG131S, D187E and D187V viruses were antigenically infected with egg-grown A/Tasmania/2004/2009 identified in one of the MIV +IFA passage lines, lies outside predicted antigenic sites [31], does not alter glycosylationand was not tested further. The N156K mutation arose in both passage lines of MIV +IFA- immunized ferrets ( Table 2 ). in antigenic site Sb [6] (Sa in [31]) ( Figure 3C, D ). relative proportions of the N156K mutant and wildtype N156 viruses were quantified inTable 1. responses and infection.

The N156K mutant emerged in R4 of line A, persisted at a similar proportion in R5, and became dominant by R6. In line B, the N156K mutant emerged earlier, in R1, and became dominant in R2, persisting through to R7 (Figure 2D ). The emergence of the N156K mutation did not result in a change of virus kinetics (peak viral load, growth rate or serial interval) compared to N156 wildtype virus (data not shown). To confirm the pyrosequencing data and to determine whether the N156K mutation was present in the original inoculum, the proportion of the N156K mutant was quantified by cloning and sequencing the HA1 gene from the original inoculum (n = 480)and from samples from the R7 ferret in each passage line, and the ferrets in which the N156K mutation was first detected (MIV +IFA R4, line A and R1, line B) (n = 96 for each) ( Table S1 ). N156K was detected only in virus samples collected from ferrets in the MIV+IFA immunization group; proportions were 2D mutations the original sequencing were also detected by cloning. Cloning revealed that L191 and R223 were mixed populations (L191L/I and R223R/Q) in the original inoculum. Two mutations were detected in the NA protein: M15I emerged in the MIV passage line A and I46F in the MIV +IFA passage line B(Table 2 ). Residue 15 is located in the N-terminus, whileresidue 46 is located in the stalk of the NA, therefore both substitutions are well outside the enzymatic site of the NA protein[32]. Full genome sequencing of R7 samples from all passage linesdetected isolated changes in some genes (e.g. M, NP, PB1, PB2,PA), but none of these substitutions were in known ofvirulence and/or transmission ( Table 2 ). N156K A/Tasmania/2004/2009 HA mutant virus is fit in na\u00a8ve ferrets To assess the ability of the N156K mutant virus to transmit and persist in vivo , variant viruses (from MIV +IFA R7 ferrets) a further seven times contact transmission inna\u00a8ve ferrets (passage lines N156K na \u00a8ve A and B). The serial interval between transmission events was similar for wildtype andN156K virus passaged in na \u00a8ve ferrets ( Transmission proceeded without interruption ( Figure S2 ) and both viral growth rate ( Figure 2B ) and peak viral loads ( Figure 2A ) were similar. Genetic analysis found no changes in the HA protein of virusisolated from the R7 ferret of N156K line A compared toinoculum (D14E +N156K). However, an additional mutation was detected (K142N in R4) and became fixed in the HA of passageline B (K142N +N156K, Table 2 ).

Na\u00a8ve donor 0 (D0) ferrets were directly infected with A/Tasmania/ 2007/2009 virus and co-housed with na \u00a8ve donor 1 (D1) ferrets to begin the contact transmission model. D0 and D1 ferrets were not included in any experimental group. Once D1 was infected, D0 was removed and a ferret from one of the four experimental groups was added (R0). Transmissionthen proceeded through R0-R7 ferrets for each group. Line A of each group is shown. The same D0 and D1 ferrets were used to establish the passageline A of the na \u00a8ve and MIV experimental groups. The same D0 ferret infected two different D1 ferrets to establish the passage line A of the PBS +IFA and MIV +IFA experimental groups. Nasal washes were collected daily from ferrets and virus load was measured by real time RT-PCR. During the experiment, both the rapid test result (PBS +IFA, MIV +IFA day 0-26) \u00a8ve, MIV, MIV +IFA day 27 onwards) were used as a marker of infection and transmission. The data points at which transmission of virus to recipient ferrets was deemed to have occurred are identified as redsymbols.

In both lines, pyrosequencing and sequencing of clones showed N156K persisted at approximately 100% in each sample and did not revert to wildtype N156 (Figure 2E, Tables 2, S1 ). The introduction of the K142N mutation did not result in a change of virus kinetics peak viral load, growth rate or serial interval) compared to N156K alone virus (data not shown). To directly compare the fitness of the wildtype, N156K and K142N +N156K viruses in the absence of immune pressure [33], na\u00a8ve ferrets were infected with mixtures of either N156 wildtype and N156K viruses (42:58% na \u00a8ve ferrets were co-housed with na \u00a8ve recipients and two transmission events occurred as before. The N156K virus outgrew the N156 wildtype virus after one or two transmission events, in duplicateexperiments ( Figure 2F ), as in the original experiment 2D ). The K142N +N156K virus outgrew the N156K virus after one or two transmission events ( Figure 2G ). This suggests that the N156K variant fitter than the N156 wildtypevirus in the ferret model. It also suggests that the K142N mutation,when added to N156K, gives a selective advantage. However, asthe K142N mutation was acquired in only one of the two lines ofpassaging the N156K virus seven times in na \u00a8ve ferrets ( Table S1), it is not essential for replication and transmission in the ferret model.

As MDCK-SIAT1 cells have enhanced levels of a-2,6-linked Neu5Ac receptors [36], as confirmed by flow cytometry (data not shown), this cell line wasused first for virus isolation. Isolates from na \u00a8ve, PBS +IFA and MIV passage lines were detected in culture supernatants at hightitres by agglutination of turkey RBC (HA .128). However, isolates from ferrets of the MIV +IFA and N156K na \u00a8ve passage lines (herein referred to as N156K mutant virus) had only lowhemagglutination titres (HA #4). Real time RT-PCR for the matrix gene indicated that levels of viral RNA in the N156Kmutant virus culture supernatant at 72 h post-infection weresimilar to those in control samples from na \u00a8ve or PBS +IFA- viruses)(Figure 3A , P1). HA and matrix protein were also detected on the surface of N156K-infected cells ( Figure 3A ) and CPE was visible (data not shown), indicating that N156K mutant virus waspresent, even in the absence of RBC agglutination. Use of RBCfrom other species (rat, ferret, guinea pig, sheep), or resialylatedRBC, or concentrated culture supernatant did not improvesensitivity in hemagglutination assays (data not shown). Uponfurther passage in MDCK-SIAT1 cells, the N156K mutant viruswas detected only at high HA titres (HA $16) when additional HA mutations were present ( Figure 3A , P2). As folding of the mutated Figure 3. Growth, detection and adaptation of N156K virus in cell cultures. (A) Virus underwent two passages in MDCK-SIAT1 cells (P1 and P2).

Infection and culture were also attempted in the presence of exogenous neuraminidase or oseltamivir carboxylate as changes in HA have been shown to affect the HA/NA balanceand influence hemagglutination and isolation in different in vitro culture systems [39]. N156K was not able to be isolated without culture adaptations in the presence of exogenous neuraminidase, or oseltamivir carboxylate (data not did not improve hemagglutination titresfor N156K either (data not shown), indicating no binding effect of the NA [39]. Culture adaptations of the HA protein were detected at residues 153, 155 and 156, most commonly as a mixed population at position 156 (N156K/E) or with mutations at positions 153 or 155 in addition to N156K (K153E +N156K or G155E +N156K) (Figure 3A, Culture adaptations were also seen in antigenic sites Sa and Sb ( Figure 3C, D ). These adaptations were not detected by clonal analysis in the nasal washes from R7 ferrets of any passage line, in the R4 or R1 ferrets of MIV +IFA passage lines A and B respectively, or in the original virus inoculum(Table S1 ). Culture of virus from peak day samples containing mixed populations of wildtype (N156) and N156K viruses resulted in outgrowth of the wildtype N156 virus as determined by RNAextraction and sequencing (data not shown). No MDCK-SIAT1culture adaptations were detected in the NA gene. Attempts to isolate the N156K mutant virus in a variety of other cell lines (MDCK, Beas-2B, Vero, A549) as well as embryonatedhen's eggs, were unsuccessful. The virus either did not grow, or it grew and was detected by real time RT-PCR, but rapidly adapted in the HA at amino acids 153-156 ( Figure 3B ). Attempts were also made to virus by ultracentrifugation from ferret bronchoalveolar lavage and homogenized lung samples, but this did not yield sufficient virus for analysis. Detection of N156K and culture adaptations in influenza surveillance data The N156K mutation has been detected in human A(H1N1)pdm09 clinical samples (analyzed for surveillance pur-poses at the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, Melbourne), both alone and in conjunc- tion with N125D, which is located in antigenic [6,40] )(Table 3 andFigure 3C, D ). N156D has been detected following passage of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in embryonated hen's eggs under immune pressure [16]. Mutations at G155 and K153 have been reported following in vitro passage of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in the absence [29] and presence of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)[15,16]. Cell culture adaptations have also been detected in routine surveillance at the WHO Collaborating Centre for Influenza, Melbourne, when passaging A(H1N1)pdm09 viruseswith mutations at N156 ( GenBank found N156K, K153E and N156D similar low frequencies (0.15, 0.20 and 0.27%, respectively); G155E has been reported more often(1.30%, Among 8446 A(H1N1)pdm09 HA sequences with classifiable passage information, most were MDCK cell isolates (69%) followed by original clinical samples (18%), SIAT1 isolates (8%) and embryonated hen's egg isolates (5%).There is no change in isolation patterns in each year (2009-2012,data not shown). The N156K mutation was found more commonly in original specimens than in cell isolates. In contrast,K153E and G155E adaptations were strongly associated with growth in MDCK cells ( Table 4 ). Cell culture adaptations may disguise the effect of N156K on the antigenic profile of A/Tasmania/2004/2009 virus Other in vitro studies have demonstrated that mutations at amino acids 153, 155 and 156 of A(H1N1)pdm09 HA1 result in antigenic drift with a reduction in HI titre to the mAbs used toinduce changes in distinct from each other[16]. We generated viruses containing the HA mutation(s) detected in our experiments by reverse genetics. All reverse genetics viruses used contained the ferret-specific adaptations L191I and R223Qin the HA protein. Neither the N156K alone nor K142N +N156K virus could be rescued as a pure population without adaptation.Rescues were attempted with both an A(H1N1) (A/PuertoRico/8/1934) and an A(H1N1)pdm09 (A/Perth/261/2009) complete backbone and were also attempted with 'humanized' vectors containing receptors L191 and Q223, but neither was successful(data not shown). Antigenic analysis by HI assay showed areduction in HI titre for all reverse genetics viruses with mutationsat positions 153-156, against serum from a ferret infected with theoriginal inoculum of A/Tasmania/2004/2009 virus, compared to wildtype virus. Both reverse genetics mutant N156E as well as surveillance viruses with mutations and adaptations at N156showed reduced HI titre compared to wildtype virus, indicatingthe antigenic importance of amino acid 156. The K142Nmutation had no effect ( Table 5 ). All reverse genetics viruses were also tested against serum from a ferret immunized once with MIV +IFA. All viruses containing mutations at positions 153-156 showed a four-fold reduction intitre compared to wildtype virus. Although the K142N mutationon its own had no effect, addition of this mutation to viruses with mutation/s at positions 153-156 reduced their titre at least four- fold further ( Table 5 ). The HA antigenicity and receptor binding profile are altered in the N156K A/Tasmania/2004/2009 HA mutant virus Our observation that N156K mutant viruses were not detected by hemagglutination and did not persist without adaptation in vitro suggested an alteration in receptor binding specificity. N156K andK142N (and K153E, R223Q) are located in regions on the HA protein proposed to contact sugars beyond Neu5Ac on cell surface receptors [28]. Thus we hypothesized that these mutations alterednot only antigenicity but also receptor binding compared towildtype virus. HA structure was investigated by flow cytometry [41] using mAb174 and mAb175, which are Sa/Sb (K153and G155) and Cb (T72) antigenic regions HA, respectively. All A(H1N1)pdm09 variantviruses wild- type viruses were recognized by mAb174, but binding was greatly reduced in the presence of the N156K mutation and cell cultureadaptations ( Figure 4A ). This effect was specific for viruses with mutations in the Sa/Sb antigenic region as the virus with K142Nmutation alone was still recognized by mAb174. Direct binding assays using antisera from immunized and virus- infected ferrets were used to assess the antigenicity of N156Kmutant virus.

HA receptor specificity was assessed by binding of synthetic multivalent glycans. Human influenza viruses have been shown tobind predominantly to 6 9sialyllactose (6 9SL) and 6 9sialyllactosa- mine (6 9SLN) and, to a lesser extent, to 3 9sialyllactose (3 9SL), as representatives of a-2,6- and a-2,3-linked Neu5Ac receptors [28,41-45]. HA on the surface of cells infected with ferret adapted A/Tasmania/2004/2009 wildtype virus bound to both 6 9SL and 69SLN ( Figure 4C ). Binding was more restricted compared to the original egg inoculum virus, presumably due to the mutationsL191I and R223Q ( Figure 4C ). Introduction of the N156K mutation to the ferret adapted virus resulted in binding to only 69SLN, indicating a strong preference for a-2,6-linked Neu5Ac receptors N156K. K153E showed weak binding to 6 9SLN, G155E showed binding to 6 9SL and 6 9SLN. Addition of G155E to N156K increased 6 9SL binding, while the addition of K153E to N156K did not alter the binding preference. Predicted receptor binding properties and structural analysis using 3-D modeling Computer modeling with a-2,6- and a-2,3-linked Neu5Ac receptors was performed to enable a structural basis for the Figure 4.

The computational results were also compared to the glycan bindingresults ( Figure S3A ). N156K is at the of three previously crystallized antibody binding sites [46-48] ( Figure S3B ). Since amino acid mutations that involve charge changes can alter thestrength of the electromagnetic field around the HA globular head, and long range electrostatic forces are often a first step to facilitate interaction with ligands and other proteins, changes in theelectrostatic surface potential due to the observed mutations were also analyzed. Although position 156 is not in the receptor binding site, our analysis suggests that small changes at this position influence HA binding, stability and receptor specificity. The N156K mutationnoticeably adds positive charge potential compared to wildtype HA (Figure 5A, B ). In contrast, N156E significantly the distribution of charge ( Figure 5C ). N156K predicted to prefer a-2,6-linked receptors ( Figure 5E ), whilst in our models it is more favorable for the N156E mutation to bind to a-2,3-linked receptors ( Figure 5E ). Adding K153E to N156K reduces the positive electrostatic potential of the HA head domain ( Figure 5D ) as does the addition of G155E N156K Figure S3C ). G155E to N156K) appearscompensatory, allowing stronger binding to a-2,3 receptors to N156K alone ( Figure 5F ,Figure S3C,D ). However, this increased a-2,3 receptor binding was not evident in the glycan binding studies that were undertaken ( Figure 4C ). Discussion This study is the first to describe the emergence of an A(H1N1)pdm09 escape variant, with altered receptor binding,following vaccine-induced immune pressure in a ferret model of contact transmission. This N156K mutation was generated in two independent lines of MIV +IFA-immunized ferrets, but was not detected in the virus used to infect ferrets, nor did it appear in unimmunized ferrets, suggesting that the N156K mutation had a selective advantage when placed under non-sterilizing immunepressure. Virus fitness was investigated in the presence and absence of immune pressure in this study. The N156K virus transmitted between immunized ferrets for up to four passages, although a break in transmission occurred in both lines. A break intransmission in vaccinated animals has also been noted in an artificial infection system of a laboratory influenza strain in mice [13]. The investigation of virus kinetics under immune pressure isunique to this ferret study. The emergence of the N156K virus did not alter the virus kinetics in the MIV +IFA-immunised ferrets. There was no change in peak viral load, growth rate or serialinterval between transmissions. This is likely a reflection of the in vivo model system. Adjuvant has been shown to restrict and broaden the immune response (reviewed by [49]), yet wasnecessary to induce even a detectable immune response in the ferret model [24]. The influence of a different adjuvant, or even a background of immunological experience through previousinfection(s), may warrant further investigation. When passaged in na\u00a8ve ferrets, the growth kinetics and transmission potential of the N156K virus was equivalent to the wildtype virus, indicating thatthe N156K mutation was not deleterious in non-immune ferrets. The N156K virus outgrew the wildtype virus in both na \u00a8ve and immunized ferrets when in direct competition, suggesting that theN156K mutant is fitter than the wildtype virus in both the presence and absence of immune pressure. The interplay between antigenic drift and receptor binding specificity and affinity has been well studied for the HA ofinfluenza viruses [13,16,50]. Due to the close proximity of the antigenic sites to the receptor binding site, antigenic changes are often accompanied by changes in the receptor binding propertiesof the virus [13,15,16] and changes in receptor binding propertiescan also produce antigenic variants [13]. Passage of influenza virus under immune pressure in vivo may favor mutations that facilitate antibody escape, but may also increase viral HA avidity for cellsurface receptors. Subsequent passaging in the absence of immunepressure in vivo may induce compensatory mutations that reduce avidity and can affect antigenicity [13]. Furthermore, mutations in A(H1N1)pdm09 HA that change positive electrostatic charge have been associated with changes in the affinity for Neu5Ac receptors[16]. We have demonstrated that the N156K mutation producedstructural changes that altered receptor specificity, including the loss of ability to agglutinate RBC from a variety of species. Changes in hemagglutination patterns with different species' RBChave also been associated with antigenic drift of A(H3N2) viruses[43,50]. The N156K mutation also increases the positive charge potential, which may be important for surface interactions of the HA protein with antibodies or more remote carbohydrate moietiesextending from the natural host receptor structure. The cellculture adaptations, K153E and G155E, are predicted to induce structural changes in the HA head that reduce the positive electrostatic potential of the HA head domain. These changeshave been shown to reduce viral HA receptor binding avidity fora-2,3- and a-2,6-linked Neu5Ac receptors in vitro [16]. Thus, we hypothesize that the N156K mutation increases receptor binding avidity compared to wildtype virus. When cultured in vitro , the cell culture adaptations negate the significant effects of the N156Kmutation on the charge distribution and alter the receptor binding preference of the HA protein (and possibly the avidity), which facilitates hemagglutination. Attempts to assess the avidity of theN156K and K142N +N156K mutants were unsuccessful due to virus isolation difficulties and the inability of the viruses to bindRBC. Interestingly subsequent passage of the N156K mutant virus in na \u00a8ve ferrets did result in an additional mutation in the HA protein, K142N, in one passage line. Although this double mutantoutgrew the N156K mutant in a competitive mixture in vivo , the K142N mutation was not acquired in both lines of passaging suggesting it is not essential for transmission in na \u00a8ve ferrets. K142N did not alter receptor binding specificity in the assays usedin this study, but whether changes in avidity have occurred isunknown. Overall, these data suggest that selection of the N156K mutant, maintained through contact transmission in ferrets, drives emergence of a virus with altered, but effective, binding toreceptors of the ferret respiratory tract, and is capable of extensivereplication in vivo .In vitro isolation difficulties indicate more detailed analysis of receptors in the ferret respiratory tract and on cell lines used for routine isolation of influenza virus may beneeded. As antiserum from a wildtype virus-infected ferretappeared directed to the N156 region and could no longer recognise the N156K mutant virus, and antiserum from a N156K virus-infected ferret appeared directed to a different region of theHA common to wildtype and N156K mutant virus, wehypothesize that immunity is directional and drives antigenic drift in this contact transmission model. We anticipate that further passage of the N156K mutant virus in homologous vaccinatedferrets (i.e vaccinated with the N156K mutant) would drive furtherdrift of the A(H1N1)pdm09 N156K virus that would be againaccompanied by changes in the receptor binding properties. Although a pure population of the N156K mutant virus could not be efficiently isolated, either from ferret nasal washes or byreverse genetics, flow cytometry antibody binding assays demon- strated that the N156K mutation causes antigenic of A(H1N1)pdm09 Virus in Ferrets PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 11 May 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 5 | e1003354supported by the following additional evidence: The N156K mutant arose only in ferrets with specific antibodies, and waspresent in both passage lines. The N156K mutant virus could notbe recognized by a monoclonal antibody (mAb174) which drivesescape Sa/Sb antigenic site of wildtype virus. N156K iscomputationally predicted to be structurally significant byintroduction of a longer charged side chain that changes thedistribution of the charge of the HA. Analysis of influenza vaccine strains over time has demonstrated that charge mutations alsocontribute to antigenic drift (unpublished data, S. Maurer-Strohand R.T.C. Lee). Alternate mutations at this position, N156E andN156D, have been shown to cause antigenic changes [16,51].Other published in vitro studies have found mutations at similar sites in the HA protein of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses ( amino acids Figure 5. 3-D modeling of HA containing N156K and cell culture adaptations.

Changes can also occur at amino acidpositions 153 and 155 in the A(H1N1)pdm09 HA without anyimmune selection pressure [29], suggesting an instability in thisregion during cell culture. No changes have been reported at 156in the A(H1N1)pdm09 HA experimentally without immunepressure. However, monoclonal antibodies from humans and mice (this study and [15,16]), and polyclonal ferret antibodies raised in this study, all targeted similar regions. This suggests thatamino acids 153-156 form an immunodominant region of the HAprotein and targeting this area results in a significant antigenicchange. A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses with mutations at position 156 have been reported in human surveillance studies ([40], WHOCollaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza,Melbourne), although they occur relatively rarely (0.15% of allsamples on GISAID with passage information). We havedemonstrated that this mutation from ferret respiratory samplesdoes not persist in cell culture without further adaptation, orreversion to wildtype virus in mixed populations. The low HA titre in the initial passage, and negative association with cell culture, may prevent identification of original clinical samples containingN156K alone, hence laboratories may exclude these viruses fromsurveillance studies. Therefore conventional methods for isolationof human samples may select against detection of mutations atposition 156. We also cannot discount the possibility that the ferretmodel has selected for a mutant that has compromised transmis- sibility in the human population, due to differences in the glycan receptor profiles between the human and ferret respiratorytract, or more complex immunity in humans with theirextensive infection and vaccination history. Use of a differentA(H1N1)pdm09 strain, cell-cultured virus or an alternateadjuvant/vaccine preparation may have also influenced themutation profile. Further analysis of viruses from the lungs ofMIV-immunized ferrets, where immune escape mutants may also emerge, would be worthwhile. A(H1N1)pdm09 has circulated over the past four years with limited genetic diversification and no significant antigenic change.Rising population immunity is likely to drive antigenic drift in theA(H1N1)pdm09 virus eventually. Passage in immune ferrets demonstrated that an antigenic mutant can arise in a similar situation. Importantly, antigenic mutations in the HA may alsoinfluence receptor binding properties, affecting the efficiency ofisolation of viruses for surveillance characterization purposes.Routine genetic analysis of original clinical specimens is thereforeimportant. In vitro and/or in vivo passage of the 2012/2013 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses under immune pressure would indicate whether N156K is permissive in the presence of additional mutations or whether other regions of the HA globular head arenow under greater selective pressure. Continued examination ofinfluenza virus escape mutants should aid in the identification offuture vaccine-breakthrough viruses, enabling their rapid detectionthrough influenza surveillance and ensuring appropriate changesto the A(H1N1)pdm09 component of seasonal influenza vaccine are made in a timely fashion. Materials and Methods Ferrets Male and female ferrets (weight, 500-1500 g) were purchased from independent breeders and housed at CSL Limited usingservices provided under a Support Services Agreement. Serumsamples from ferrets were tested by HI assay to ensure seronegativity (titre ,20) to currently circulating influenza strains before use. Experiments using ferrets were conducted withapproval from the CSL Limited/Pfizer Animal Ethics Committee,in accordance with the Australian Code of Practice for the Careand Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes. Viruses and cells A/Tasmania/2004/2009 virus was isolated from an elderly patient who succumbed to influenza infection in July 2009, as part of routine influenza surveillance activities at the WHO Collabo-rating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza,Melbourne. The sample was anonymized. Viruses were passagedin the allantoic cavity of embryonated hen's stored at (CCL-34:ATCC) (kindly provided Marburg, Marburg, Germany) were maintained the absence of G418 sulphate. A549and Vero cells were maintained in the same conditions as MDCK cells. BEAS-2B cells (kindly provided by Dr R. Gualano The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia) were maintained at 37 uC, 5% CO 2prior to infection and following infection, unless indicated. Vaccine formulation and administration Full or half adult doses (15 mg or 7.5 mg HA in 0.5 mL, respectively) of human monovalent A(H1N1)pdm09 influenzavaccine containing the HA and NA of A/California/7/2009(MIV) (Panvax, a gift from CSL Limited) were used for immunization. Ferrets were immunized with MIV alone or Freund's +IFA). Control ferrets were immunized with PBS emulsified in IFA (1 ml total volume) (PBS +IFA) or did not receive vaccine (na \u00a8ve). Adjuvanted vaccines were delivered to anaesthetized Ilium Xylazil-20:Ketamil, Troy Laboratories) intramuscularly in of both hind legs using a 1-mL syringe with a 22-gaugeneedle. Animals received one dose of MIV +IFA or PBS +IFA or two doses of MIV two weeks apart. Vaccinated animals were used 24 to 94 days after the final immunization. Serum was collectedbefore and after each vaccination, immediately before ferrets wereincluded in the contact transmission passaging and at sacrifice. Virus infection of donor ferrets and passaging of virus by contact transmission Na\u00a8ve donor ferrets (termed Donor 0; D0) were anaesthetized and infected artificially by intranasal inoculation with 103.550% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID 50) egg-grown influenza virus. After inoculation, D0 ferrets were housed individually in a HEPA- filtered isolation unit. The following day, two na \u00a8ve ferrets (both termed Donor 1; D1) were co-housed with each D0 ferret andremained in continual contact, until they became naturallyinfected with influenza virus (see below). Once a D1 ferret was found to be infected it was placed in a separate clean cage, to then infect the first ferret of a passage line. Na \u00a8ve donor ferrets (D0 and D1) were used to establish a transmission chain as previous studieshave indicated that direct inoculation of in vitro cultured virus can alter viral diversity within a host [53]. Four different D0 ferrets infected seven different D1 ferrets, each D1 ferret toAntigenic Virus in Ferrets PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 13 May 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 5 | e1003354start one (or two) passage lines (as indicated in Figure 1 andS1). Each line involved sequential passage of virus through eight recipient ferrets that had received one of three different treatments (MIV +IFA, MIV, PBS +IFA) or no treatment (na \u00a8ve). The first recipient ferrets from each immunization group (R0) were co- housed with one of the D1 ferrets until they became naturally infected. 24 hours after the viral load measurement from each R0 ferret indicated that they were infected, the R0 ferret was co- housed with the next recipient ferret (R1) from their line. Transmission experiments continued for each immunization group until seven passages had been completed (R0 to R7).Duplicate lines were performed for each immunization group, designated line A and line B. Ferrets were sacrificed and respiratory tissues and serum were collected after they had successfully transmitted the virus to the new recipient ferret. The recipient order for the passage lines was randomly assigned in each immunization group, irrespective of HI antibody titre following immunization, or days since immunization. Detection of virus infection in ferrets Nasal washes were collected daily under light sedation (30 mg/ kg Ilium Xylazil-20; Troy Laboratories) by delivery of 1 ml PBS supplemented with 50 U/ml penicillin, (Sigma-Aldrich) into the nostril. Expelled liquid was collected and 140 ml was aliquoted for RNA extraction (see below) and real time RT-PCR analysis, 60 ml for TCID 50analysis, 30 ml for rapid test analysis and the remainder stored at280uC. Animals were weighed and visually inspected daily and their temperature was measured using implanted temperature transponders fitted to identification chips (LifeChip Bio-Thermo, Digivet). Daily nasal wash samples were assessed for virus shedding as a measure of infection by rapid test analysis (BD Directigen EZ Flu A +B kit, Becton Dickinson) or by real time RT-PCR analysis of extracted RNA for matrix 1 gene. Transmission was deemed to have occurred when the new recipient ferret returned a positive rapid test, or a positive real time RT-PCR result (Ct #25). Real time RT-PCR RNA was extracted from nasal washes, cell culture supernatants or allantoic fluid using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). An 8 ml aliquot of RNA was treated with RNAse Free DNase I (New England Biolab) in a total reaction volume of 10 ml, according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNase-treated RNA (4ml ) was used to amplify influenza A matrix 1 using CDC Atlanta (USA) InfA F primer and InfA probe [54] and modified InfA R primer (5 9GGGCATTYTGGACAAAKCGTCTACG3 9) with SuperScript III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR kit (Invitro- gen). The RT-PCR consisted of 1 cycle of 50 uC for 5 min and 95uC for 2 min and 40 cycles of 95 uC for 3 s, 60 uC for 30 s using the 7500 Fast Real-Time System (Applied Biosystems) and 7500 Fast System SDS Software version 1.4.0. The threshold was automatically set and Ct determined. RNA standards were prepared from pGEMT-A/California/7/2009 and pGEMT-A/ Perth/16/2009 Matrix plasmids using the Riboprobe In Vitro Transcription Systems (Promega). For all runs, samples (assayed in duplicate), no-template control, RNA standards and positive and negative controls were included. The 95% confidence interval for RNA standards was 0.78 Ct (n = 65 assays). The detection limit was 10 copies. Preparation of cDNA for genetic analysis cDNA was synthesized from 5 ml RNA isolated from ferret nasal wash (peak day of infection), cell culture supernatants or allantoicfluid, using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis primer [55], to manufac-turer's instructions. cDNA generated from ferret nasal wash wassequenced, used in pyrosequencing assays, or amplified by PCRand cloned. Genetic sequencing Viral genes were amplified from cDNA or DNA plasmids (see below) using MyTaq HS Mix (Bioline) with M13 tagged-gene-specific primers ([56] and WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, Melbourne - sequences available upon request) or plasmid-specific primers, according tothe a 96-well plate format using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Life Technologies), followed by the removal of excess dye terminators with a BigDyeXTerminator purification kit (Applied Biosystems). The sequencewas determined using an automated capillary DNA sequencer(ABI Prism 3500xL). Identification of mixed bases was at 25%.Sequences were assembled using DNASTAR Lasergene Suitev.9.1.0 Seqman v 9.1. Nucleotide sequence accession for all segments of A/Tasmania/ 2004/2009 egg-grown virus inoculum are available from under accession number EPI_ISL_129743. of A/Tasmania/2004/2009 virus from cDNA generated from ferret nasal wash was amplified using gene-specificprimers and cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega)according to the manufacturer's instructions. For reverse genetics,the entire HA and NA genes of A/Auckland/1/2009 (A(H1N1)pdm09) virus [24] were amplified from cDNA generated from a clinical specimen using ThermoScript RT-PCR System(Invitrogen) using primers containing BsmBI and accordingto the manufacturer's instructions. S203T, Q223R and H496Nwere introduced into the HA gene to generate pHW-2000-A/Tasmania/2004/2009 HA vector. L191I and R223Q were then introduced to generate ferret-adapted pHW-2000-A/Tasmania/ 2004/2009 HA vector. S388T was introduced into the NA geneto generate pHW-2000-A/Tasmania/2004/2009 NA vector.Further mutations and adaptations were introduced as indicatedin the text. Mutations were introduced using the QuikChange IISite-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Strategene) with the QuikChangePrimer Design +N156K mutants Two separate pyrosequencing a ssays were utilized. The first quantified the proportion of the N156 (wildtype) vs the N156Kmutant (WT/N156K). The second proportion ofK142 vs K142N mutant (N156K/K142N +N156K). A 350 bp region of the HA1 gene flanking amino acid positions 142 and 156 wasamplified from plasmid mixtures and from cDNA from ferret peak dayAntigenic Drift of A(H1N1)pdm09 Virus in Ferrets PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 14 May 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 5 | e1003354nasal wash samples using MyTaq HS Mix (Bioline) with biotinylated forward primer (5 9Biotin-GCAATTGAGCTCAGTGTCATC) and reverse primer (5 9TTCCGGCTTGAACTTCTTGC) (for the WT/ N156K assay) or forward primer CATC) manufacturer's in structions. The pyrosequencing reaction was performed as previously described [58], using internal primers 5 9GGATTTGCTGAGCTTTGGGT and 5 9CTCATGC- TGGAGCAAA, specific for the N156K and K142N mutations, respectively. The proportions of N156 and K156, or K142 and N142,HA in the sample, were estimated by calculating the ratio of the two peaks representing the N156 and K156, or K142 and N142 HA, using the AQ mode in the PyroMark ID 1.0 software. The N156K mutation generates a quadruplicate run of ad enosines, which does not quantify absolutely by this technology [59-61], thus the detection limit was 5- 10% for N156K. To correct for the sensitivity of the assay, all nasal wash samples were run with a set of plasmid mixtures containing various ratios. Mixtures of pGEMT plasmids ratios (100:0, 80:20, 50:50, 20:80, 0:100), at multiple concentrations (1, 0.1, 0.001 pg total). A standard curve was generated using the plasmid mixtures and the proportion of N156/K156 or K142/N142 in each nasal wash sample was determined by comparison to a standard curve. All samples were run in triplicate. Analysis of variants by cloning The HA1 gene was amplified from cDNA generated from ferret nasal washes or egg-grown A/Tasmania/2004/2009 Velocity PCR kit (Bioline) with M13 tagged-HA1-specific primers (as above). Amplified product of the correct size was purified using the E-Gel CloneWell system (Invitrogen) and cloned using the Zero Blunt TOPO Cloning Kit for Sequencing (Invitrogen). DNA from 96 individual colonies with confirmed HA insert was sequenced for all samples except the initial inoculum for which 480 colonies were sequenced. HA1 was amplified using MyTaqHS using the same primers. Poor quality sequences were excluded from the data set. As a control, the pGEMT-A/Tasmania/2004/ 2009 HA1 plasmid was transcribed using the Riboprobe In Vitro Transcription Systems (Promega), cDNA synthesized as above, then the HA1 gene amplified and cloned; 96 individual colonies were sequenced. The error rate in the amplification system, as determined by sequencing 96 clones from a single plasmid, was less than 0.001%. Reverse genetics rescue of influenza A viruses Engineered viruses were generated as previously described [57], with infectious virus detected by hemagglutination and real time RT-PCR of culture supernatants. All viruses contained the HA and NA from ferret-adapted A/Tasmania/2004/2009 including specified mutations, whilst the remaining genes were from A(H1N1) A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (pHW2000-A/Puerto Rico/8/ 1934 vectors, a kind gift from St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA) or A(H1N1)pdm09 A/Perth/261/ 2009. Virus infection of cell cultures and analyses Cells were seeded into T25 flasks or 24-well tissue culture plates and grown to confluence overnight. Monolayers were washedtwice with Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline before incubation with 500 or 100 ml virus, respectively (nasal wash samples inoculated at 1/6 to 1/10 dilution; isolates inoculated neat; egg-grown virus 1/100) at 37 uC and 5% CO 2for 30 min, or other temperatures, as indicated. The inoculum was removed and replaced with medium (without fetal calf serum) supplemented with 4 of the ethyl ester prodrug oseltamivir phosphate, kindly provided by Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Switzerland) was added to cultures asindicated in the text. Supernatant was collected daily and the presence of virus was assessed by hemagglutination using 1% turkey RBC and by real time RT-PCR assays for the influenza A matrix gene. Infection was also assessed by surface staining of infected cells and analysis by flow cytometry. Cells were stained with anti-influenza A anti-ferret Ig-FITC Biotechnology and KPL). Staining was performed in the presence of 1 mM oseltamivir carboxylate. Samples were run on a FC500 Analyzer (Beckman Coulter) or FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences) using FlowJo 7.5.5 software. Flow cytometry-based glycan binding assay The binding specificity of influenza HA was determined using an assay previously described [41]. Briefly, MDCK-SIAT1 cell monolayers, in 24-well plates, were infected with the same copy number of influenza virus from different ferret nasal washes, or reverse genetics viruses. After 48 h, cells were harvested, washed three times with PBS and stained with biotinylated multivalent glycans (5 mg/ml) and mouse anti-influenza A matrix mAb in PBS, with 1 mM oseltamivir carboxylate for 2 h at GlycoTech USA). To detect biotinylated glycan binding, cells were incubated with streptavidin- RPE (Vector Laboratories, USA) and mouse mAb was detected with anti-mouse Ig-FITC in PBS with 1 mM oseltamivir carbox- ylate, for 1 h at 4 uC. Samples were analysed by flow cytometry. Cell culture supernatant was also collected upon cell harvest and assessed by real time RT-PCR and hemagglutination. HA and NA genes were sequenced to ensure no adaptations had occurred. Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) assay Reactivity of serum samples was HI assays [62] as described elsewhere [63]. Titres were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum for which hemagglu- tination was prevented. calculated with undetectable as '5'. Seroconversion was defined as titre $40. Statistics Viral growth kinetics were assessed using real time RT-PCR data. Animals artificially infected by intranasal inoculation were excluded from the analysis. The virus growth rate was calculated as the difference between viral copy number between the peak dayand the first day, divided by the number of days to reach peak viral copy number. Animals for which viral load peaked on day 1 were excluded. The serial interval between transmission was defined asAntigenic Drift of A(H1N1)pdm09 Virus in Ferrets PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 15 May 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 5 | e1003354the number of days between virus detection in the infecting and infected ferret. Only transmission events where both animals were deemed infected using the same method of detection were included. Transmission events involving artificially inoculated animals or interruptions (see results) were excluded. Data were analysed using one-way ANOVA, and Bonferonni correction to adjust for multiple comparisons, using STATA. Ferret antisera binding to virus-infected cells was analyzed by comparing the relative proportion from wildtype and N156K-infected cells for each antiserum using Spearman's rank correlation co-efficient. Statistically significant results are indicated with * p ,0.05, ** p,0.01 and *** p ,0.005. Analysis of frequency of mutations in human clinical specimens on GISAID and Genbank All A(H1N1)pdm09 HA sequences from viruses isolated from a human host since 2009 were downloaded from GISAID and GenBank, and filtered to remove strains occurring multiple times. The resulting 16740 sequences were aligned using MAFFT [64]. To determine whether a mutation preferentially occurred in a culture type, sequences with passage history were classified into four categories based on the source from which they were extracted and sequenced: (i) embryonated hen's egg, (ii) MDCK cells, (iii) MDCK-SIAT1 cells and (iv) original clinical sample. The odds ratios were calculated from the probabilities of occurrence of the mutant and the wildtype in each of the source cell types. The degree of association of the mutants to the source cell types were classified into 5 categories: (i) moderate association (1.5-3), (ii) strong association ( .3.0), (iii) moderate negative association (0.33- 0.66), (iv) strong negative association ( ,0.33) and (v) association (0.66-1.5) [65]. 3-D modeling Simulated annealing energy minimizations through short molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the AMBER03 force field in YASARA were done for wildtype and mutant HAs in complex with either a-2,3 or a-2,6 ligand (PDBs: 3ubj chains C and D or 3ube chains A and B, respectively [66]. For structural correspondence, only the sialic acid and the first bound galactose of the ligands were kept. The ligands were parameterized automatically by YASARA [67]. YASARA has been previously shown to provide excellent results in the CASP competition for homology model refinements [68]. The used minimization protocol comprises the following steps: in short, to remove bumps and correct the covalent geometry, the structure was energy- minimized with the AMBER03 force field [69], using a 7.86431 Angstroem force cutoff and the Particle Mesh Ewald algorithm [70] to treat long-range electrostatic interactions. After removal of conformational stress by a short steepest descent minimization, the procedure continued by simulated annealing (time step 2 fs, atom velocities scaled down by 0.9 every 10th step) until convergence was reached, i.e. the energy improved by less than 0.05 kJ/mol per atom during 200 steps. Counterions are implicitly considered by setting the net charges to 0. Solvation is also considered implicitly by a term proportional to the accessible surface area. 1.2 kJ/mol was used as the estimate for the entropic cost of exposing one square Angstroem to the solvent. To further reduce the computational complexity and potential unrelated simulation bias, atoms further than 8 Angstroem from either the ligand or therespective mutated residues were fixed (not allowed to move). This resulted in a system of both flexible ligand and flexible receptor binding pocket. The relative binding energies were estimated through a function considering standard potential energy terms plus the above mentioned implicit solvation. Three steps ofsequential forward and backward mutations for each mutation set were employed and averaged over the visited energy minima.Finally, for each analyzed single or pair mutation(s) we subtractedthe predicted energy for binding the a-2,6 receptor from the predicted energy for binding the a-2,3 receptor. Higher values of the measure therefore indicate a-2,6 preference while lower values would point to relative a-2,3 preference. In order to compare the predicted measure with the experimental glycan binding data (seeabove), we derived a corresponding relative preference value bysubtracting the mean fluorescence intensity of glycan expressionfor 39SL from the average for 6 9SL and 6 9SLN for the respective mutation(s). The subtraction order of experimental receptor datawas inversed to obtain a direct linear correlation with thecomputational measure. Supporting Information Figure S1 Time course of influenza transmission through B passage lines. A separate D0 and D1 ferret established the passage line B of the na \u00a8ve experimental group. Similarly, a separate D0 and D1 ferret established passage line B ofthe MIV experimental group. The same D0 ferret infected twodifferent D1 ferrets to establish the passage line B of the PBS +IFA and MIV +IFA experimental groups. Nasal washes were collected daily from ferrets and virus load measured by real time RT-PCR.During the experiment, both the rapid test result (PBS +IFA, MIV+IFA day 0-26) and the raw Ct value (na \u00a8ve, MIV, MIV +IFA day 27 onwards) was used as a marker of infection andtransmission.
