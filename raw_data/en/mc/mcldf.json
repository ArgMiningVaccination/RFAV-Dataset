Here are tips for minimizing the fear and pain of vaccinations for your baby or toddler.", "sitename": "WhattoExpect", "date": "2020-12-14", "cleaned_text": "Most pipsqueaks dread the painful prick of a shot \u2014 or the doctor's office experience altogether \u2014 making visits stressful on you, too. And while it's hard to see your little one hurting or frightened, getting vaccinated is one of the best things you can do to ensure his health and well-being. That's why it's essential to stay on top of your child's inoculations (the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a printable [recommended vaccination schedule](//www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/easy-to-read/child.html) that should help). Still, the experience can be challenging for parents of both babies and toddlers. Once your child reaches a certain age, he's likely smartened up to the fact that doctor checkups might include a shot. And this realization may make way for a fear of shots and lots of pre-checkup anxiety \u2014 not to mention lots of in-office kicking and screaming. To help ease your [child's fear](//www.whattoexpect.com/toddler-development/toddler-fears.aspx) of shots and immunizations while also minimizing the anxiety for both of you, try these strategies. How parents can prepare for their child's scheduled vaccinations Before your child's appointment, read up on the [scheduled vaccines](//www.whattoexpect.com/child-vaccinations/what-shots-to-get.aspx) and write down any questions or concerns you may have. If you're taking your baby or toddler to a new doctor's office, make sure to bring his immunization records with you. This data is also necessary for enrolling your little one in day care, preschool or summer camp, and for international travel. Your best bet is to keep the history in a digital file, but your child's pediatrician or your state health department will also have a record. Another must-bring on shot day: a favorite toy, stuffed animal or blanket. At the doctor's office, don't be shy about asking questions. A few that might be helpful include: Recommended Reading - What symptoms can I expect my child to experience in the hours and days after the vaccination? - What are the signs of a serious reaction? - What pain meds, if any, can I give to help relieve discomfort? The [Vaccine Information Statement](//www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/index.html) (VIS) on the CDC's Web site is also a great resource about vaccines and possible side effects. How parents can make shots easier for babies - Keep your cool. When your baby is getting his shots, cuddle your little one as you sing or talk softly and soothingly. Try to keep smiling and maintain eye contact so he looks at you instead of the needle. - Master holding your baby. In general, a not-too-tight embrace is the way to go: too loose and your wiggle worm may slip away from the needle, too tight and your child's anxiety may increase. For an [infant getting vaccinated](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/preparing-for-baby/things-to-know-about-infant-vaccines-before-baby-arrives/)in the leg, hold the child directly on your lap with his side against you. Place your arm that's closest to his back around her and hold her outer arm. Apply gentle pressure for a gentle hug. Use your free arm to hold your child's other arm gently but securely. The CDC also recommends anchoring your child's legs firmly between your thighs so he can't make a break for the door. - Bring distractions. Use his stuffed animal, a toy or a book to distract him. - Calm him down. If you're breastfeeding, nurse during the vaccination or right afterward to help calm him down. Skin-to-skin contact, suckling and the sweet taste of your milk are all natural pain relievers for a baby. A bottle or pacifier can help, too. How parents can make shots easier for toddlers - Tell the truth. If you have a toddler or preschooler, be honest with him \u2014 explain what a shot is and what he can expect when he's at the doctor's office. Tell him there will be a quick pinch (or two) and that the pain he'll feel will be over in a second. Tap him on the arm to show just how quick a second is. If he has an older sibling, enlist his support by having him talk about how he got shots, too, and it wasn't so bad. Explain that shots are an important part of children's health and they will make sure that your child doesn't get sick. Time your talk for the day before or morning of your visit so your little one doesn't have a chance to let anxiety build over several days. - Consider timing. Although it's not always possible to plan your child's day, try to schedule the appointment at a time when you know he will be well rested and fed (i.e. not during naptime). - Bring distractions. A teddy bear to clutch, bubbles to blow (also teach your toddler to blow during the injection, which minimizes the pain), a favorite book to read out loud. Having the doctor \"examine\" a doll or teddy first, while your toddler holds it, can help lessen his fear of shots, too. - Stay calm. If you're anticipating a hard time when the shot's approaching \u2014 or if you're sending stress signals of your own \u2014 your toddler's bound to crumble. - Master holding your toddler. For older children who are getting a vaccination in the arm, the CDC recommends that you either hold your child on your lap facing out, or have him stand in front of you facing out while you are seated. Anchor his legs between your thighs so he can't make any sudden movements, and embrace him as he gets the shot. - Offer comfort post-shot. The best way to soothe a just-vaccinated child is with a soft, calm voice. Support and empathy go a long way here \u2014 tell him you know that was scary and you're proud of him for getting through it. Even if your toddler yelled or screamed the whole time, this is a big deal for a little kid, so for best results next time, pump up the praise this time. - Consider a post-shot treat. Promise a trip to the playground, the children's museum, the ice cream shop or the toy store for a little ticket item. Don't withhold the treat if your toddler wasn't cooperative \u2014 having had the shot should entitle him to the treat, no best-behavior-strings attached. How to minimize your child's discomfort after a shot Most kids experience mild reactions to vaccinations, such as pain at the injection site, a rash or a fever. These are perfectly normal and should go away within a few days. You can help relieve his discomfort by putting a cool, wet towel on the injection site, drawing a lukewarm or tepid bath to reduce a fever, and giving your child an age-appropriate, non-aspirin pain reliever (as long as your doctor approves). Make sure he stays well-hydrated and call the doctor with any concerns. One last tip: A bowl of ice cream usually helps a lot! Just remember that children take their emotional cues from their parents \u2014 and even the youngest babies will be able to sense your fear and anxiety. If you're a nervous wreck every time the needle appears, your child is likely to react in the same way you do. If you're the model of mellow, your child's likely to be calmer, too. So deep breaths! The good thing is it's over quickly. "}
