The basic concept of chiropractic therapy The body has a powerful and surprising ability to health itself. The spine and its function have a close relation, which affects our health. The goal of chiropractic therapy is to normalise the relationship between the structure and function and help the body as it heals. What happens in a typical chiropractic session During your first visit, your chiropractor will go through your medical history and will examine you physically. You might also be asked to go through other lab tests such as X-ray and more. It's post all the tests that the chiropractor will determine if you should undergo the chiropractic therapy. During the treatment, one or more adjustments might be done. Adjustments are also called manipulation. The therapy is done manually, which means it is done by hands. The adjustments are done to increase the quality and range of motion in the area being treated. Apart from manipulation, most chiropractors use other treatments such as mobilization (moving a joint through the range of its motion), massage and non-manual treatments such as applying ice or heat and electric stimulation. Side effects of chiropractic treatment Chiropractic treatment does not have any severe side effects. Some side effects include temporary discomfort in the parts of the body that have been treated, dizziness and headache. These side effects go away in one-two days.
