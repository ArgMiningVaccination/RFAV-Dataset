UCSF requires patients awaiting lung transplants to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. We also strongly encourage this for patients awaiting kidney, liver, pancreas and heart transplants. We updated these policies on May 11, 2023, in response to the end of the public health emergency and the availability of highly effective therapies for COVID-19. Where to get the COVID-19 vaccine If you come to UCSF for primary care, you can book a vaccine or booster appointment by contacting your primary care provider. We no longer offer drive-through vaccination. For some patients, it may be quicker to get the vaccine at a nearby pharmacy or vaccination clinic. To schedule an appointment, visit your pharmacy's website, your county's vaccine website, California's [My Turn](https://myturn.ca.gov/) or the national [vaccines.gov](http://vaccines.gov/) site.

FAQ: Understanding the COVID-19 vaccine and boosters Most people should get vaccinated and boosted.
