The symptoms can be easily written off because they include relatively common things like insomnia, weight gain, anxiety, depression, infertility, chronic illness, dull skin, low sex drive, low energy, ADHD, and more. Further, there are many different types of endocrine disorders that include diabetes, adrenal & 2, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), and precocious puberty. Many people suffer in silence without realizing just how significant an impact on health an endocrine disorder has. There are many ways to treat endocrine dysfunction and some include lifestyle & diet changes and some include medication but it is important to look at holistic health and healing when treating endocrine dysfunction. Acupuncture and herbal remedies are not only valid treatments but exceptionally effective in the treatment of endocrine dysfunction. When discussing a holistic approach to treating endocrine dysfunction, it is important to understand what exactly the endocrine system is and how it functions in the human body. [WebMD](http://www.webmd.com/diabetes/endocrine-system-disorders#1) provides a helpful description of endocrine system function, \"The endocrine system is a network of glands that produce and release hormones that help control many important body functions, including the body's ability to change calories into energy that powers cells and organs. The endocrine system influences how your heart beats, how your bones and tissues grow, even your ability to make a baby. It plays a vital role in whether or not you develop diabetes, thyroid disease, growth disorders, sexual dysfunction, and a host of other hormone-related disorders... Each gland of the endocrine system releases specific hormones into your bloodstream. These hormones travel through your blood to other cells and help control or coordinate many body processes... Even the slightest hiccup with the function of one or more of these glands can throw off the delicate balance of hormones in your body and lead to an endocrine disorder, or endocrine disease.\" Acupuncture is a helpful tool in the treatment of endocrine dysfunction because it addresses the root cause of the problem and seeks to restore hormonal and energy balance within the body. Achieving the hormonal balance necessary to regulate the endocrine system requires recognizing the synergistic relationship between organs and glands in the body which is exactly what acupuncture does. A truly integrative approach to treating or healing endocrine dysfunction typically includes the addition of herbal remedies as well. By treating the body through a combination of nutrition, acupuncture, and herbal remedies, deficits can be replenished and homeostasis restored. Herbal remedies are frequently targeted towards supporting specific glands and hormones. Herbal remedies may include B vitamins, Vitamin C, glutamine, tyrosine, GABA, selenium, zinc, iodine, magnesium, fish oil, and more depending on your specific symptoms. A holistic and integrative approach to health and wellness including acupuncture and herbal remedies can help you treat and even heal endocrine dysfunction. "}
