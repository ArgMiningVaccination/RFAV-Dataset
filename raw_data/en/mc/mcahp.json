WHAT IS AN EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION (EUA)?

The FDA may issue an EUA when certain criteria are met, w hich includes that there are no adequate, approved, available alternatives. In addition, the FDA decision is based on the totality of scientific evidence available showing that the product may be effective to prevent COVID -19 during the COVID -19 pandemic and that the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks of the product . All of these criteria must be met to allow for the product to be used in the treatment of patients during the COVID -19 pandemic. 9 Revised: 29 October 2021 This EUA for the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine and COMIRNATY will end when the Secretary of HHS determines that the circumstances justifying the EUA no longer exist or when there is a change in the approval status of the product such that an EUA is no longer needed.
