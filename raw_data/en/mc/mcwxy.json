We improve health and wellness through standard chiropractic care, along with a variety of other treatment modalities. Aiding in Injury Recovery Although our health and wellness care encompasses the entire body, we do help patients recover from injuries, including those from auto accidents, sports, and personal injuries. Helping With Headaches and Musculoskeletal Pain We help patients who are suffering from musculoskeletal pain in locations like their back or neck to better manage their pain. For those who have recurring headaches or migraines, we assist the patient in easing their symptoms and reducing the number of headache days they experience. For patients who don't want to rely on medications or would just like better control over their symptoms, we offer care for digestive issues, adrenal fatigue, allergies, and more. Going Beyond Standard Chiropractic Care At our wellness clinic, we offer an array of services beyond standard chiropractic care, such as weight loss. We recognize that your health is more than just the pain you experience, and weight loss can be crucial in improving your life. It can also be the root of some of what ails you. You'll notice our care includes a variety of other services as well, such as homeopathy, ionic foot detox, massage therapy, and more. This helps us to achieve optimal results for our patients. At Renaissance Wellness, we believe your health can have a \"rebirth.\" You don't have to suffer from health issues that are taking a toll on your life.
