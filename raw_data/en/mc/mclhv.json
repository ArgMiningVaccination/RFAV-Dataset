Only those who can understand Chinese characters could diagnose and prescribe remedies in Northern Medicine. The theory of Northern Medicine is based on the Yin-Yang interactions and the eight trigrams, as used in Chinese Medicine.

[[32]](#cite_note-SOWJM-32) This is theoretically possible because snake oil is higher in [eicosapentaenoic acid](/wiki/Eicosapentaenoic_acid) than most other oils. But there are no scientific studies showing that rubbing it on joints has any positive effect, or that snake oil is safe for daily consumption.

[[82]](#cite_note-82) This study, however, was subject to a variety of criticisms concerning its experimental design and interpretations. [[83]](#cite_note-83) Published studies have also reported possible medicinal benefits of Lycium barbarum, especially due to its antioxidant properties, [[84]](#cite_note-84) including potential benefits against cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases, [[85]](#cite_note-85) [[86]](#cite_note-86) vision-related [immunomodulatory](/wiki/Immunomodulator) agent.

[[75]](#cite_note-chineseherbacademy.org-75) Strychnine[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_traditional_Chinese_medicines&action=edit\u00a7ion=53)] The seeds of the [Strychnine tree](/wiki/Strychnine_tree), [Strychnos nux-vomica](/wiki/Strychnos), are sometimes used to treat diseases of the respiratory tract, anemia, and geriatric complaints. The active molecule is [strychnine](/wiki/Strychnine), a compound often used as a [pesticide](/wiki/Pesticide). [[98]](#cite_note-98) [Strychnine](/wiki/Strychnine) can also be used as a [stimulant](/wiki/Stimulant) - however it has an extremely low [therapeutic index](/wiki/Therapeutic_index) and better, less toxic replacements are wormwood[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_traditional_Chinese_medicines&action=edit\u00a7ion=54)] Sweet wormwood ( [Artemisia annua](/wiki/Artemisia_annua), Qing Hao) is believed under TCM to treat fever, headache, dizziness, stopping bleeding, and alternating fever and chills. Sweet wormwood had fallen out of common use under TCM until it was rediscovered in the 1970s when the [Chinese Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergency Treatments](/w/index.php?title=Chinese_Handbook_of_Prescriptions_for_Emergency_Treatments&action=edit&redlink=1) (340 AD) was found. This [pharmacopeia](/wiki/Pharmacopeia) contained recipes for a tea from dried leaves, prescribed for fevers (not specifically [malaria](/wiki/Malaria)). The plant extracts often used in TCM are [antimalarial](/wiki/Antimalarial), due to the presence of [artemisinin](/wiki/Artemisinin). [[100]](#cite_note-100) However, it has been questioned as to whether tea made from A. annua is effective against [malaria](/wiki/Malaria), since artemesinin is not soluble in water and the resulting tea would not be expected to contain any significant amount of artemesinin. [[101]](#cite_note-101) [[102]](#cite_note-102) [[103]](#cite_note-103) Willow bark[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_traditional_Chinese_medicines&action=edit\u00a7ion=55)] [Plants of the Salix](/wiki/Willow) have been used since the time of [Hippocrates](/wiki/Hippocrates) (400 BC) when patients were advised to chew on the bark to reduce fever and inflammation. Willow bark has been used throughout the centuries in China and Europe to the present for the treatment of pain (particularly low back pain and [osteoarthritis](/wiki/Osteoarthritis)), [headache](/wiki/Headache), and inflammatory conditions such as [bursitis](/wiki/Bursitis) and [tendinitis](/wiki/Tendinitis). The bark of white willow contains salicin, which is a chemical similar to aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid). It is thought to be responsible for the pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory effects of the herb. In 1829, salicin was used to develop aspirin. White willow appears to be slower than aspirin to bring pain relief, but the analgesia may last longer. [edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_traditional_Chinese_medicines&action=edit\u00a7ion=57)] [Arsenic Huang) is mineral used in TCM to kill [parasitic worms](/wiki/Parasitic_worms) and treat sore throats, swellings, abscesses, itching, rashes, and malaria. [[105]](#cite_note-plos-105) [[106]](#cite_note-RA-106) Arsenic, while possibly essential for life in tiny amounts, is extremely toxic in the amounts used and [arsenic poisoning](/wiki/Arsenic_poisoning) may result from use of arsenic containing remedies. [[106]](#cite_note-RA-106) They are most commonly given as a pill or capsule, although are sometimes incorporated into a mixture with other substances. [[106]](#cite_note-RA-106) Lead[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_traditional_Chinese_medicines&action=edit\u00a7ion=58)] [Galena](/wiki/Galena) is used in TCM to treat ringworm, skin disorders and ulcers, and is thought to \"detoxify\" the body. [[107]](#cite_note-gat-107) It is crushed and taken orally or used on the skin. [[107]](#cite_note-gat-107) [Lead tetroxide](/wiki/Lead_tetroxide) (Qian Dan) is used to treat anxiety, itching, and malaria. [[105]](#cite_note-plos-105) [[108]](#cite_note-108) [[109]](#cite_note-109) [[110]](#cite_note-110) It is important to note that most lead compounds are extremely toxic. Mercury[ has historically been used in Chinese medicine, where it is called zhsh ( [](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%9C%B1%E7%A0%82)), and was highly valued in [Chinese Alchemy](/wiki/Chinese_alchemy). also referred to of immortality\". [Cinnabar](/wiki/Cinnabar) has been used in Traditional Chinese medicine as a sedative for more than 2000 years, and has been shown to have sedative and toxic effects in mice. [[111]](#cite_note-NEC-111) In addition to being used for insomnia, cinnabar is thought to be effective for cold sores, sore throat, and some skin infections. [[112]](#cite_note-112) Corrosive sublimate[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_traditional_Chinese_medicines&action=edit\u00a7ion=61)] [Mercury(II) chloride](/wiki/Mercury(II)_chloride) (Qing Fen) is used in TCM to \"detoxify\" the body, kill intestinal parasites, and as [[105]](#cite_note-plos-105) [[113]](#cite_note-113) See also[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_traditional_Chinese_medicines&action=edit\u00a7ion=62)] clinical research on Chinese integrative medicine, Keji Chen, Bei Yu, Chinese Medical Journal, 1999, 112 (10), p. 934, [[1]](http://wenku.baidu.com/view/dfc192a0b0717fd5360cdc44.html) [Archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20110707204820/http://wenku.baidu.com/view/dfc192a0b0717fd5360cdc44.html)2011-07-07 at the [Wayback Machine](/wiki/Wayback_Machine) Yue 1992, p.11 [^](#cite_ref-3) [\"More information on complementary and alternative medicine Cancer Society\"](http://www.cancer.org/Treatment/TreatmentsandSideEffects/ComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine/HerbsVitaminsandMinerals/chinese-herbal-medicine).
