We offer online herbal medicine consultations, as well as online guided healing sessions. Description of Services Acupuncture Acupuncture relies on the activation of points and channels along the body. Points and channels express the complex dynamics of Yin and Yang and the cyclical phases of the Five Elements within our bodies. It empowers us to utilize these principles to benefit our health in countless ways. Acupuncture treatments may include additional therapeutic methods such as moxibustion, cupping, and herbal compresses. New Herbalism & Nutrition Herbal formulae are among the most important methods of treatment in traditional East Asian medicine. Nutrition is an important component of balanced health. Herbal formulae can benefit many conditions including internal medical issues, orthopedics, pain management, and psychoemotional health. We work with the theory of Chinese Medicine, Tibetan Medicine, and Ayurveda for both our herbal and nutritional recommendations.

Individual readings help us understand our unique patterning related to our ancestral rhythm and the greater, interconnected cycles of qi.

A reading can help you understand your placement in the larger sphere of natural rhythms, helping you know when to push and when to glide.
