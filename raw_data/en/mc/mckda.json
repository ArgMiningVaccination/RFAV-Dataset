PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY What is the question? The question is: What is the relationship between dietary patterns consumed and sarcopenia ? What is the answer to the question? Dietary patterns Insufficient evidence is available to determine the relationship between dietary patterns and sarcopenia in older adults. Diets based on macronutrient distribution Insufficient evidence was available to determine the relationship between diets based on m acronutrient distribution and sarcopenia. Why was this question asked? This important public health question was identified by the U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Health and Human Services (HHS) to be examined by the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Adv isory Committee. How was this question answer ed? The 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, Dietary Patterns Subcommittee conducted a systematic review to answer this question with support from the Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review (NESR) team. Dietary patterns were defined as the quantities, proportions, variety, or combination of different foods, drinks, and nutrients (when available) in diets, and the frequency with which they are habitually consumed. Diets based on macronutrient distribution were examined when at least one macronutrient proportion was outside of the acceptable macronutrient distribution range (AMDR) for carbohydrate, fat, and/or protein. What is the population of interest? For the intervention/exposure, adolescents through older adults For the outcome, adults and older adults What evidence was found? This review identified 4 articles that met inclusion criteria. Four articles examined dietary patterns and sarcopenia. Two articles also examined diets based on macronutrient distribution and sarcopenia . Studies differed in dietary pattern methods, macronutrient distributions, and assessment of sarcopenia. Results from the included studies were inconsistent. 9 Several limitations in the study design and conduct of included articles were identified. This includes a lack of accounting for potential confounders or possible changes in dietary intake over time. The 2020 C ommittee could not draw conclusions due to limitations in and lack of evidence. How up -to-date is this systematic review? This review searched for studies from January , 2000 and October , 2019. 10 TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background This important public health question was identified by the U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Health and Human Services (HHS) to be examined by the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. The 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, Dietary Patterns Subcommittee conducted a systematic review to answer this question with support from the Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review (NESR) team. The goal of this systematic review was to examine the following question: What is the relationship between dietary patterns consumed and sarcopenia? Conclusion statement s and grades Dietary patterns Insufficient evidence is available to determine the relationship between dietary patterns and sarcopenia in older adults. (Grade: Grade n ot assignable) Diets based on macronutrient distribution Insufficient evidence was available to determine the relationship between diets based on macronutrient distribution and sarcopenia. (Grade: Grade n ot assignable) Methods Two literature searches were conducted using 3 databases (PubMed, Cochrane, Embase) to identify articles that evaluated the interventi on or exposure of dietary patterns consumed and the outcomes of sarcopenia. A manual search was conducted to identify articles that may not have been included in the electronic databases searched. Articles were screened by two NESR analysts independently for inclusion based on pre- determined criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted for each included study, and both were checked for accuracy. The Committee qualitatively synthesized the body of evidence to inform development of a c onclusion statement(s), and graded the strength of evidence using pre- established criteria for risk of bias, consistency, directness, precision, and generalizability. Summary of the evidence This systematic review includes 4 prospective cohort studies that examined the relationship between dietary patterns and sarcopenia, 2 of which also examined diets based on macronutrient distribution, that met inclusion criteria, and were published between January 2000 and October 2019. o Two of the studies reported macronutrient distributions in which the percent of energy from fat was higher than the AMDR. o Dietary patterns were defined as the quantities, proportions, variety, or combination of different f oods, drinks, and nutrients (when available) in diets, and the frequency with which they are habitually consumed. o Diets based on macronutrient distribution were examined when at least one macronutrient proportion was outside of the acceptable macronutrient distribution range (AMDR) for carbohydrate, fat, and/or protein. When describing and categorizing studies included in this review, the Committee 11 did not label the diets examined as \"low\" or \"high,\" because no universally accepted, standard definition is currently available, for example, for \"low - carbohydrate\" or \"high- fat\" diets. Instead, the Committee focused on whether, and the extent to which, the proportions of the macronutrients were below or above the AMDR The studies were inconsistent, both in term s of which dietary patterns or macronutrient distributions that were examined, how dietary intake was assessed, assessment of sarcopenia, and results reported regarding the association between dietary patterns and risk of sarcopenia. In addition, the studi es had relatively small sample sizes with few cases of sarcopenia. The body of evidence had several risks of bias, including lack of adjustment for all potential confounders, and assessment of diet only once at baseline, and lack of account ing for possible changes in dietary intake that may have occurred over follow- up. The studies were direct and generalizable, in that that the intervention, comparators, and outcomes of interest in the included studies are directly related to the systematic re view question, and are applicable to the U.S. population. However, study participants may have been healthier than the average older adult . 12 FULL REVIEW Systematic review question What is the relationship between dietary patterns consumed and sarcopenia ?

Two studies included bot h men and women,1,2 one study included only women,3 and one study included only men.4 Mean age of participants at bas eline ranged from approximately 68 years to >85 years. Intervention/exposure Included studies examined dietary patterns using a variety of methods. One study identified dietary patterns using factor analysis , 1 one study identified dietary patterns using cluster analysis ,2 and 3 studies examined adherence to dietary patterns using 6 different indices or scores .1,3,4 Two studies2,3 examined dietary patterns in which the proportion of energy from fat was above the AMDR in at least one of the exposure groups compared (i.e., each cluster2 or thir d quartile3). Dietary intake was assessed using a variety of validated methods, including a food- frequency questionnaire,1 24-hour dietary recall using a multiple pass method,2 and 3- day3 or 7-day4 food records. In all studies, diet was assessed once, at baseline. Outcome assessment All included studies examined risk of developing sarcopenia, with follow -up ranging from 3-4 years1-3 to 16 years .4 One study defined s arcopenia using the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia algorithm ,1 and 3 studies defined sarcopenia using the European Working Gr oup on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) criteria .2-4 In all of the included studies , sarcopenia was defined as low muscle mass with low muscle strength (based on handgrip strength) and/or low muscle performance (based on wal king speed). However, Isanejad et al3 included participants considered to be pre- sarcopenic (low muscle mass only) or sarcopenic in analyses .3 Evidence synthesis Results reported in the studies included in this systematic review were mixed (Table 2). Chan et al1 analyzed data from a prospective cohort study from Hong Kong that included both men and women (51% female), aged ~72 years .1 Five dietary patterns were examined, including 2 dietary patterns based on an index/score (Dietary Quality Index -International score (DQI -I), Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)), and 3 via -Milk Products\", and \"Meat - Fish\"). None of the dietary patterns examined were significantly associated with risk of sarcopenia after 4 years of follow -up. 1 Granic et al2 analyzed data from a prospective cohort study from the United Kingdom 14 that included both men and women (62% female), all over 85 years of age.2 Three dietary patterns were examined, that were identified via 3 patterns had a mean percent energy from fat higher than the AMDR. Adherence to a 'Traditional British' compared to a 'Low Butter' dietary pattern at >85 years was associated with higher risk of prevalent sarcopenia at 3 year follow- up. However, it was not significantly associated with incident sarcopenia. Adherence to a 'Low Red Meat' compared to a 'Low Butter' dietary pattern was not significantly associated with risk of prevalent or incident sarcopenia. In addition, results were similar when stratified by protein intake >1 or <1g/kg adjusted body weight /day.2 Isanejad et al3 analyzed data from a prospective cohort study from Finland that included only women, aged ~68 years .3 Two dietary patterns were examined that w ere based on an index/ score (Baltic Sea Diet Score (BSD) and MDS. For the BSD score, one quartile had percent energy from fat higher than the AMDR. Hig her BSD score (categorical) at 68 years was significantly associated with reduced risk of sarcopenia after 3 year follow- up. However, associations were not significant when BSD was analyzed continuously. MDS score at 68 years was not signi ficantly associat ed with risk of sarcopenia after 3 year follow- up when analyzed either continuously or categorically. In this study, pre- sarcopenic and sarcopenic women were combined, and analyzed together .3 Karlsson et al4 analyzed data from a prospectiv e cohort study from Sweden that included only men, aged ~71 years .4 Two dietary patterns were examined that were based on an index/score ( Modified Healthy Diet Indicator (mHDI) , modified Mediterranean Diet Score (mMDS)). Higher mHDI score (medium vs. low) at 71 years was significantly ass ociated with lower risk of sarcopenia at 87 years . However, high vs. low score and analysis of scores continuously were not significantly associated with risk of sarcopenia. Higher mMDS score (continuous) at 71 years was associated with lower risk of sarco penia at 87 years . However, when mMDS scores were analyzed categorically (low vs. medium or high), there were no significant associations with risk of sarcopenia . 4 Assessment of the evidence 1Fii This systematic review included only 4 studies that met inclusion criteria, and all were prospective cohort studies. I t was determined that this body of evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions about the relationship between dietary patterns and risk of sarcopenia, or diets based on macronutrient distribution and risk of sarcopenia. As outlined and described in detail below, the body of evidence was assessed for the following elements used when grading the strength of evidence. Risk of b ias: The included articles had a number of potential risks of bias, or limitations, that make interpretation of results difficult (Table 1; Table 3) . While ii A detailed description of the methodology used for grading the strength of the evidence is available on the NESR website : https ://nesr.usda.gov/2020- dietary -guidelines -advisory -committee -systematic - reviews and in Part C of the following reference: Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. 20 20. Scientific Report of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee: Advisory Report to the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health and Human Services . U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Washington, DC. 15 studies adjusted for a number of potential confounders, they did not adjust for all key confounders, such as race/e thnicity or physical disability. These studies examined dietary patterns only once at baseline, and did not account for possible changes in dietary intake that may hav e occurred over follow -up. In addition, the studies enrolled older individuals, and did not account for dietary patterns consumed earlier in life. None of the studies accounted for missing data, either due to lost to follow- up or criteria used when selecting subjects into the analyses. Attrition due to mortality was not reported by the included articles. The studies are also prone to selection bias. Though subjects enrolled in the study were intended to be representative of the general population in the country or region where the study was conducted, they likely represent healthier individuals (i.e., those able to walk, take public transportation, or with int erest in preventing future falls or fracture). Finally, none of the studies had preregistered statistical plans, and therefore, there is potential for selective outcome reporting. Consistency: The studies were inconsistent, both in terms of which dietary patterns were examined, how dietary intake was assessed, assessment of sarcopenia, and results reported regarding the association between dietary patterns and risk of sarcopenia. Directness: The populations, intervention, comparators, and outcomes of interest in the included studies are directly related to the systematic review question. Precision: The studies had small analytic sample sizes with relatively few sarcopenia cases. The widt h of confidence intervals indicates imprecision within the body of evidence. Generalizability : The interventions and/or exposures, comparators, and outcomes examined in the body of evidence are applicable to the U.S. population. However, study participant s may have been healthier than the average older adult (i.e., those able to walk, take public transportation, or with interest in preventing future falls or fracture) Research recommendations In order to better assess the relationship between dietary patterns and sarcopenia, future research may: 1. Assess information regarding diet at more than one time- point, preferably during the course of follow -up, to facilitated determining the relationship between dietary . patterns over time and sarcopenia. 2. Examine the relationship between dietary patterns earlier in life and risk of sarcopenia . 3. Provide sufficient information , definitions or standards, and repeated measures on the quantification, i.e., types and amounts of foods/food groups such as fruits and vegetables, and beverages such as alcohol, consumed when examining the relationship between dietary patterns and/or diets based on macronutrient distribution and sarcopenia. 16 4. Include diverse populations with varying race/ethnicity, age, sex/gender, socioeconomic background, and chronic disease status, while ensuring to report the racial/ethnic background of participants studied. 17 Included articles 1.

Do not describe the entire macronutrient distribution of the diet (i.e., studies that only examine a single macronutrient in relation to outcomes) xii Institute of Medicine. Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protei n, and Amino Acids. Washington (DC): The National Academies Press; 2002. xiii Macronutrient percent of energy outside of the AMDR are as follows: Carbohydrate for all age groups: <45 or >65 percent of energy; Protein for children, 1-3y: <5 or >20 percent of energy, Protein for children, 4-18y: <10 or >30 percent of energy, Protein for adults, age 19y and older: <10 or >35 percent of energy; Fat for children, 1-3y: <30 or >40 percent of energy, Fat for children, 4-18y: <25 or >35 percent of energy, Fat for adults, age 19y and older: <20 or >35 percent of energy. 31 Category Inclusion Criteria Exclusion Criteria Comparator Dietary patterns described by foods and beverages consumed: o Consumption of and/or adherence to a different dietary pattern o Different levels of consumption of and/or adherence to a dietary pattern Diets described by macronutrient distribution o Different macronutrient distribution of carbohydrate, fat, and protein N/A Outcomes Studies that report sarcopenia or severe sarcopenia N/A Date of publication January 2000 - October 2019 Articles published prior to January 2000 or after October 2019 Publication status Articles that have been peer -reviewed Articles that have not been peer -reviewed and are not published in peer -reviewed journals, including unpublished data, manuscripts, pre -prints, reports, abstracts, and conference proceedings Language of publication Articles published in English Articles published in languages other than English Country 13Fxiv Studies conducted in countries ranked as high or higher human development Studies conducted in countries ranked as medium or lower human development Study participants Human participants Males Females Non-human participants (i.e., animals) Women during pregnancy and lactation Age of study participants Age at intervention or exposure: o Adolescents (ages 12- 18 years) o Adults (ages 19- 64 years) o Older adults (ages 65 years and older) Age at outcome: o Adults (ages 19- 64 years) o Older adults (ages 65 years and older) Age at intervention or exposure: o Infants and toddlers (birth to 24 months) o Children (ages 2- 12 years) Age at outcome: o Infants and toddlers (birth to 24 months) o Children and adolescents (ages 2- 18 years) xivThe Human Development classification was based on the Human Development Index (HDI) ranking from the year the study intervention occurred or data were collected ( UN Development Program. HDI 1990 -2017 HDRO calculations based on data from UNDESA (2017a), UNESCO Institute for Statistics (2018), United Nations Statistics Division (2018b), World Bank (2018b), Barro and Lee (2016) and IMF (2018). Available from: http://hdr.undp.org/en/data ). If the study did not report the year in which the intervention occurred or data were collected, the HDI classification for the year of publication was applied. HDI values are available from 1980, and then from 1990 to present. If a study was conducted prior to 1990, the HDI classification from 1990 was applied. If a study was conducted in 2018 or 2019, the most current HDI classification was applied. When a country was not included in the HDI ranking, the current country classification from the World Bank was used instead ( The World Bank. World Bank country and lending groups. Available from: https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519 -world -country -and-lending -groups ). 32 Category Inclusion Criteria Exclusion Criteria Health status of study participants Studies that enroll participants who are healthy and/or at risk for chronic disease, including those with obesity Studies that enroll some participants diagnosed with a disease or with sarcopenia or severe sarcopenia Studies that exclusively enroll participants diagnosed with a disease. (For this criterion, studies that exclusively enroll subjects with obesity will be included.) Studies that exclusively enroll participants diagnosed with sarcopenia, or severe sarcopenia (i.e., studies that aim to treat participants who have already been diagnosed with the outcome of interest) 33 Electronic databases and search terms Listed below are the databases searched to identify all potentially relevant articles that have been published to address the systematic review question. A search strategy was developed and implemented in three databases (PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Embase) to conduct this systematic review.

The results of the electronic database searches, after removal of duplicates, were sc reened independently by two NESR analysts using a step- wise process by reviewing titles, abstracts, and full -texts to determine which articles met the inclusion criteria. Refer to Table 5 for the rationale for exclusion for each excluded full -text article. A manual search was done to find articles that were not identified when searching the electronic databases; all manually identified articles are also screened to determine whether they meet criteria for inclusion. 37 Figure 2: Flow chart of literature search and screening results 38 Excluded Articles The table below lists the articles excluded after full -text screening, and includes columns for the categories of inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Table 1) that studies were excluded based on. At least one reason for exclusion is provided for each article, as indicated by an \"X\" in one of the columns, though this may not reflect all possible reasons for exclusion.
