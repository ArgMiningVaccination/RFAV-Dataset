Read these quotes to discover what no one in the government, the media or the pharma-controlled medical journals will ever tell you: Peanut oils were introduced as vaccine excipients in the mid 1960s. By 1980 they had become the preferred excipient. They were considered adjuvants - substances able to increase reactivity to the vaccine. This reinforced the Adjuvant Myth: the illusion that immune response is the same as immunity: the pretense being that the stronger the allergic response to the vaccine, the greater will be the immunity that is conferred. The first study of peanut allergies was not undertaken until 1973. It was a study of peanut excipients in vaccines. - Vaccination Is Not Immunization by Tim O'Shea As vaccines doubled between the 1980s and the 1990s, thousands of kids were now exhibiting peanut sensitivities, with many violent reactions, sometimes fatal. Following the next quantum increase in vaccines on the Mandated Schedule after 9/11, when the total shot up to 68 recommended vaccines, peanut allergy soon reached epidemic proportions: a million children: 1.5% of them. - Vaccination Is Not Immunization by Tim O'Shea There is some compelling evidence that vaccines given in the first year of life can be a trigger for autoimmune disorders and allergies. This is one of the many reasons that I recommend delaying some infant vaccines. Food [allergies](https://www.naturalnews.com/allergies.html) Since I've started practicing, I've seen a huge jump in children being diagnosed with increasingly severe food allergies at younger and younger ages. - The Vaccine-Friendly Plan - Dr. Paul's Safe and Effective Approach to Immunity and Health by Paul Thomas, M.D. I include allergies to [vaccines](https://www.naturalnews.com/vaccines.html) in the category of infec-tants because I have seen they can be a troublesome trigger for asthma and other chronic health problems. For example, people with chronic joint and nervous system problems do well when treated with NAET for polio. I have also treated many children suffering from side effects of the diphtheria-pertussus-tetanus (DPT) [vaccine](https://www.naturalnews.com/vaccine.html) . When the DPT vaccine is given to people who are allergic to it, it can cause chronic immune suppression and can be involved in immune reactions. - Winning the War Against Asthma & Allergies by Eller W. Cutler DC Thimerosal was the preservative in allergy shots before 2000, and is still used in influenza vaccines - though it was banned in other vaccines in 2000. It is still used in vaccines in third-world countries. Pregnant women with Rh negative blood usually receive Rhogam injections either during, or immediately after pregnancy, to prevent an antigenic reaction to their baby's blood if it happens to be Rh positive. Until 2001, these injections contained thimerosal, which rapidly degrades to ethyl mercury in the body, enters the placenta, and crosses the blood-brain barrier of the fetus. - Mercury Poisoning - The Undiagnosed Epidemic by David Hammond Vaccines may provide some of these damaging proteins, because they contain traces of monkey kidney cells and chick embryo cell cultures, as well as casein, or milk protein. The presence of these foreign proteins injected in the blood may sensitize the [child](https://www.naturalnews.com/child.html) to develop allergic reactions that may later manifest as allergies. - VACCINE EPIDEMIC - How Corporate Greed, Biased Science, and Coercive Government Threaten Our Human Rights, Our Health, and Our Children by Louise Kuo Habakus, M.A. and Mary Holland, J.D. Many vaccines contain aluminum adjuvants to stimulate an immune response. In susceptible individuals, these vaccines can cause ASIA syndrome, an autoimmune disease with neurological and cognitive manifestations. Aluminum adjuvants in vaccines have also been linked to conditions such as arthritis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic fatigue syndrome, Gulf War syndrome, macrophagic myofasciitis, granuloma formation and allergic reactions. - Millers Review of Critical Vaccine Studies - 400 Important Scientific Papers Summarized by Neil Z. Miller A case-by-case approach is critical to be able to screen for those whom vaccines are mostly likely to harm. Medical professionals acknowledge that some people -- including infants, those with severe allergies to vaccine ingredients, and those with immunodeficiencies -- are unable to receive certain or all vaccines. Doctors do not know how children at risk will respond to a specific antigen or to the cumulative impact of multiple, simultaneous vaccines. - VACCINE EPIDEMIC - How Corporate Greed, Biased Science, and Coercive Government Threaten Our Human Rights, Our Health, and Our Children by Louise Kuo Habakus, M.A. and Mary Holland, J.D. Simply put, vaccines mimic the viruses that cause the disease they are designed to prevent; only, in milder doses. In CFS cases, the body cannot tell the difference between an infectious virus and a vaccine. Some researchers have noted a link between CFS and specific vaccines, like the ones for Hepatitis B, cholera, influenza, tetanus and typhoid. The fact is that individuals who are prone to CFS, flibomyaliga, allergies and autoimmune disorders consistently report flare-ups after being exposed to various types of vaccines. - Vaccine-nation - Poisoning the Population, One Shot at a Time by Andreas Moritz I do say that I would like to test the children for vaccines before they are immunized to avoid adverse reactions. I have seen adverse reactions to both the MMR and the DPT vaccines that can cause long-term health problems, especially for asthmatics. - Winning the War Against Asthma & Allergies by Eller W. Cutler DC I also check for reactions to vaccines that people have received as children such as tetanus, DPT, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, or any vaccine taken for travel abroad. I test and treat for each vaccine individually. I find these vaccines can stress and suppress the immune system for years unless allergies to them are cleared. - Winning the War Against Asthma & Allergies by Eller W. Cutler DC Aluminum in vaccines can cause macrophagic myofasciitis, chronic fatigue, and muscle weakness \"Macrophagic myofaciitis may be defined as an emerging novel condition that may be triggered by exposure to alum-containing vaccines, in patients with a specific genetic background.\" Aluminum in vaccines can cause macrophagic myofaciitis (MMF), an adverse immune reaction that manifests as chronic fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, and muscle weakness. - Millers Review of Critical Vaccine Studies - 400 Important Scientific Papers Summarized by Neil Z. Miller This is the briefest of summaries on the recent proof for the connection between vaccines and peanut anaphylaxis. ...[I]f you have a child you are about to vaccinate, can you really be making an informed decision when the sole source of your information comes from those making their living by selling shots? - Vaccination Is Not Immunization by Tim O'Shea Research coming from Purdue University, (O'Driscoll) found out that vaccines cause auto-immune response in dogs. In other words, vaccines are creating antibodies to the dog's own DNA, as well as to their own collagen. Read the study! The reader is also directed to the predictably horrifying How To Protect Your Dog From a Vaccine as well as Dr Mason's They Shoot Horses. A LITTLE RESEARCH PROJECT Find someone whose kids were never vaccinated. I don't know, just do it. Now ask if their kids get colds, allergies, infections, asthma... Just ask them. - Vaccination Is Not Immunization by Tim O'Shea As the previously mentioned research has shown, children in Iceland or Norway who only receive a total of 11 vaccines have a much lower risk of developing autism or dying than children in the US. Federal public health officials recommend that children should get a total of 69 doses of 16 vaccines from the day of their birth to age 18. We have already seen that children have a much higher incidence of asthma, allergies, ear infections, tonsillitis, and other serious ailments after they are vaccinated. - Vaccine-nation - Poisoning the Population, One Shot at a Time by Andreas Moritz The first vaccines given are hepatitis B, DPT (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis), influenza type B, and polio. In total, an average American child is vaccinated against ten childhood diseases and receives up to 21 shots over a course of the first 15 months of life. It is well documented that certain vaccines can cause immediate allergic reactions in some children; these reactions range from temporary discomfort to death. - Alternative Medicine - The Definitive Guide (2nd Edition) by Larry Trivieri Other studies, in particular those by Neil Cox and Angela Forsyth in 1988, Lars Forstrom in 1980, and JoAnn Royhans in 1984, pointed out the unsuitability of Thimerosal in vaccines because of its inherent toxicity, its capacity to induce allergic responses in upward of 29 percent of persons exposed to the preservative, and its poor antiseptic effectiveness. In the Cox and Forsyth study, the authors wrote that \"severe reactions to thiomersal [Thimerosal] demonstrate a need for vaccines with an alternative preservative.\" - Thimerosal - Let the Science Speak - The Evidence Supporting the Immediate Removal of Mercury -- a Known Neurotoxin -- from Vaccines by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. The recipe for the vaccines your child is taking may include the following ingredients: . Aluminum: This metal is added to vaccines, in the form of gels or salts, to promote the production of antibodies. Aluminum has been named as a possible cause of seizures, Alzheimer s disease, brain damage, and dementia. A study published in Pediatrics, for example, found that children who received a pertussis vaccine containing aluminum experienced allergic responses while children who received a non-aluminum pertussis vaccine did not have such reactions. - What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Children's Vaccinations by Stephania Cave, M.D., F.A.A.F.P. Glutamate: Glutamate is used to stabilize some vaccines against heat, light, and other environmental conditions. It is known to cause adverse reactions and is found in the varicella vaccine. Neomycin: This antibiotic is used to prevent germs from growing in vaccine cultures. Neomycin causes allergic reactions in some people. It is found in the MMR and the polio (IPV) vaccines. Phenol: This coal-tar derivative is used in the production of dyes, disinfectants, plastics, preservatives, and germicides. - What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Children's Vaccinations by Stephania Cave, M.D., F.A.A.F.P. A link between vaccines and autism seems to grow clearer and clearer as the evidence mounts. There is also an apparent association between autism and autoimmune disorders, as the majority of autistic children also have gastrointestinal problems, asthma, allergies, or other autoimmune diseases. This is not to say that every child who gets any of these vaccines will develop autism or behavioral problems. But parents should be aware that the risk exists. - What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Children's Vaccinations by Stephania Cave, M.D., F.A.A.F.P. As such, a large body of case material has emerged suggesting that vaccines tend to weaken the immune system of many individuals. In addition to immediate reactions (high fever, aberrant behavior, and others), chronic illness (asthma, eczema, allergies, recurrent otitis media, learning \"disabilities,\" and more) has been linked to several of the vaccines. - Vaccination The Issue of Our Times by Peggy O'Mara The stabilizers and sterilizers in vaccines include aluminum derivatives, mercury-based products (through the 1990s), antibiotics, and formaldehyde (effectively used to preserve corpses). \"Most of these components challenge the human immune system, leaving people at greater risk of infections,\" Dr. Horowitz explains. \"Vaccine proteins have been implicated in making people more sensitive to environmental allergens, such as dust and pollens, that would typically be ignored by stimulated white blood cells.\" - Alternative Medicine - The Definitive Guide (2nd Edition) by Larry Trivieri The use of multiple vaccines, which prevents natural immunity, promotes the development of allergies and asthma. A New Zealand study disclosed that 23% of vaccinated children develop asthma compared to zero in unvaccinated children. Cancer was a very rare illness in the 1890's. This evidence about immune system injury from vaccination affords a plausible explanation for Dr. Clarke's finding that only vaccinated individuals got cancer. - A Physician's Guide to Natural Health Products That Work by James A Howenstine In addition to its use in vaccines, thimerosal was used as a topical antiseptic until it caused the deaths of ten babies in Canada when it was applied to their umbilical cords. It was also used as a preservative in contact lens cleaning solutions, but this practice was discontinued in the 1990s as many users developed an allergic reaction to it. In 1980, an FDA advisory committee on ethyl mercury determined that thimerosal was unsafe and should not be added to over the counter preparations such as skin creams and ointments and other over the counter drugs. - Mercury Poisoning - The Undiagnosed Epidemic by David Hammond "}
