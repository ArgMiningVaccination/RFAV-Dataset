PUBLIC HEALTH IMMUNIZATION PROGRAM Governor: M. Jodi Rell Commissioner : J. Robert Galvin, M.D. IMMUNIZATION ACTION PLAN GLAXOSMITHKLINE SUBMITS BIOLOGICS LICENSE APPLICATION FOR FDA APPROVAL OF BOOSTRIX On July 7, 2004 GlaxoSmithKline (GSK ) announced it had submitted a Bio- logics Application (BLA) for Boostrix [Tetanus and Acellular Pertus sis Vaccine, Adsorbed (Tdap)], to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). GSK is seeking US marketing ap- proval for the booster vaccine, a similar formulation of which is available in Australia and a number of countries in Europe, South America and Asia, as a vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus and Pertussis. Currently, Pertussis vaccination in the U.S. is available only to children below the age of seven. Boostrix was developed to offer extended protection against Pertussis to adolescents between the ages of 10 and 18 by combining a Pertussis vaccine with the routine tetanus/diphtheria booster dose. Cases of Pertussis have increased since the mid-1970s. In fact, Pertussis is the only disease for which children are routinely vaccinated that is currently on the rise in the U.S., with approximately 10,000 cases in 2003- the highest number of cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Pre- vention (CDC) in more than 35 years. According (Continued on page 2) Immunity from child- hood vaccination generally wanes after five to 10 years, leaving many adolescents suscep- tible to this serious and highly contagious disease. STATE CRACKS DOWN ON VACCINES FOR CHILDREN FRAUD Under the federal Vaccines for Children prog ram, CT supplies free vaccine to all pe- diatric providers in the state to vaccinate children 0-18 years of age in their prac- tice. In receiving free vaccine, providers agree not to charge patients or their in- surers for the cost of the vaccine. In an effort to identify CT physicians who may be billing health care insurers for vaccine they received free from the state, an in- vestigation called \"Operation Free Shot\" was undertaken. This collaborative effort involves participation from several members of The Health Care Fraud Task Force, coordinated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human services. So far there have been two physicians in CT charged with health care fraud. The doctors are expected to pay thousands of dollars in fines and reimbursements and may face imprisonment. The investigation is ongoing. Pediatric and family physi- cians are advised to review their vaccine and well-child visit billing practices.

REQUIREMENTS FOR SCHOOL....... (insert) VACCINES DO NOT CAUSE AUTISM...............4 MORBIDITY REPORT..........................4 Once again, CT leads the nation in child-hood immunizations. According to the most recent National Immunization Survey (NIS) Data, CT leads the nation with a 94% coverage rate for a complete series of childhood vaccinations which includes: 4 DTaP, 3 polio, 1 MMR, 3 Hepatitis B, and 3 Heamophilus Influenza Type B (HiB) Childhood immunization rates are at record high levels, including significant in- creases in rates of immunization for chick- enpox and pneumococcal pneumonia, the two most recent additions to the childhood immunization schedule. Complete NIS data can be found in the CDC's current Morbid- ity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) on line at www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/ mmwrhtml/mm5329a3.htm Page 2 PNEUMOCOCCAL CONJUGATE VACCINE In March 2004, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that the third and fourth doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) be withheld due to continued production problems in the manufacturing of the vaccine. Production problems now appear to be re- solved permitting the return to a 3 dose schedule. Revised Recommendations for use of state-supplied PCV: CDC, in consultation with the American Academy of Pediat-rics, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is recom- mending, effective immediately, that all health-care provid- ers return to a 3 dose schedule for pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Additionally, providers can begin to recall all chil- dren who were deferred their third dose of PCV. The fourth dose of PCV should cont inue to be deferred for all healthy children until furthe r production and supply data demonstrate that a 4 dose sc hedule can be sustained. Health-care providers should continue to administer a full four dose series to children at increased risk for severe pneumococcal disease due to ce rtain immunocompromising or chronic conditions (e.g. sickle cell disease, anatomic as- plenia, chronic heart or lung disease, diabetes, cerebrospi- nal fluid leak, and cochlear implant). Records should con- tinue to be maintained for children whose fourth dose is de- ferred until such time that supplies are adequate. As a reminder, the Immunization Program only pro- vides PCV for VFC-eligible children 2-23 months of age. VFC eligibility includes children who are: 1) enrolled in Medicaid; 2) uninsured; 3) American Indian or Alaskan Native; or 4) underinsured (children whose health insurance does not in- clude vaccinations). HEPATITIS B Effective October 1, 2004 for the school year com- mencing in 2005, and each school year thereafter, each public or independent institution of higher education shall provide: (1) information about hepatitis B and the risks of contract- ing hepatitis B by college-age individuals, to all matricu- lated students, and (2) Notice of the availability and benefits of a hepatitis B vaccine For guidance on implementation and to obtain educational materials, please call the State Immunization Program at (860) 509-7929 or visit: http://www.immunize.org/catg.d/ p4090.htm PEDIATRIC INFLUENZA Influenza disease causes approximately 36,000 deaths and 114,000 hospitalizations each year. Young children have high rates of influenza-related hospitalizations and are one of the groups more likely to get complications from the flu. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) officially recommends healthy children 6-23 months of age to be vaccinated with influenza vaccine. The ACIP also rec- ommends persons who live with or care for persons at high risk are vaccinated. The Immunization Program will make available this September pediatric influenza vaccine to immunize all VFC-eligible children 6-23 months of age, and all VFC-eligible children and adolescents 2-18 years of age who have risk factors for influenza disease or are household contacts of people with risk factors for contracting influenza. High-risk conditions include asthma, diabetes, and immunosuppr essed individuals. In ad- dition, those individuals who are underinsured (have health insurance that does not cover the cost of immunizations) can be referred to a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) to be immunized with VFC supplied vaccine. Both preservative-free and thimerosal-containing influenza formulations will be available. Further information on ordering influenza will be forthcoming. Need an Immunization History? Call CIRTS at: (860) 509-7935 (Continued from page 1) to the CDC, from 1997 to 2000, about one-third of all reported Pertussis cases occurred in adolescents 10 years of age or older . Adolescents, in whom classic signs and symptoms of Pertussis are often absent , may go undiagnosed and be the source of infection for suscept ible infants and other family members. In addition to the public health threat Pertussis poses, the disease also has economic repercussions. A cost-bene fit analysis for the use of a Pertussis booster vaccine in adolescents projected that vaccination of people in the U.S. ages 10-19 during a 10-year period would pre- vent up to 1.8 million cases of Pertussis and save as much as $1.6 billion in direct and indirect costs.

All state-licensed day care homes and facili- ties must comply with state regulations. If a parent sub- mits a signed statement of objection to vaccines for reli- gious reasons, the day care facility must accept the child. IOM REPORT SAYS MMR AND THIMEROSAL-CONTAININ G VACCINES NOT ASSOCIATED WITH AUTISM On May 18, 2004, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academies released \"Immunization Safety Review: Vaccines and A utism,\" the third IOM report about vaccines and autism. The report states that based on a thorough review of clinical and epidemiological s tudies, neither the mercury-based vaccine preservative thimerosal nor measles-mump \"The over whelming evi- dence from several well-designed studies indicates that childhood vaccines are not associated with autism,\" said committee chai r Marie McCormick, Sumner and Esther Feldberg Professor of Maternal and Child Health, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston. \"We strongly suppor t ongoing re- search to discover the cause or causes of this devastating disorder. Resources would be used most effectively if they were dire cted toward those avenues of inquiry that offer the greatest promise for answers.
