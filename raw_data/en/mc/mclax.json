[[1]](#cite_note-mol-1) [[2]](#cite_note-2) Generally, these traditions are [oral](/wiki/Oral_tradition) rather than [scriptural](/wiki/Religious_text) and are passed down from one generation to another through folk tales, songs, and festivals, [[3]](#cite_note-3) [[4]](#cite_note-4) [[5]](#cite_note-5) and include beliefs in spirits and higher and lower gods, sometimes including a supreme being, as well as the [veneration of the dead](/wiki/Veneration_of_the_dead), and use of [magic](/wiki/Magic_(supernatural)) and [traditional African medicine](/wiki/Traditional_African_medicine). Most religions can be described as [animistic](/wiki/Animism) [[7]](#cite_note-7) with various [polytheistic](/wiki/Polytheistic) and [pantheistic](/wiki/Pantheistic) aspects. [[1]](#cite_note-mol-1) [[8]](#cite_note-8) The role of humanity is generally seen as one of harmonizing nature with the supernatural. [[1]](#cite_note-mol-1) [[9]](#cite_note-9) Spread[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Traditional_African_religions&action=edit\u00a7ion=1)] Adherents of traditional religions in [Africa](/wiki/Africa) are distributed among 43 countries and are estimated to number over 100 million. [[10]](#cite_note-Encyclbrit-10) [[11]](#cite_note-Lugira-11) Although most Africans today are adherents of [Christianity](/wiki/Christianity) or [Islam](/wiki/Islam), African people often combine the practice of their traditional beliefs with the practice of Abrahamic religions. [[12]](#cite_note-googlemix-12) [[13]](#cite_note-13) [[14]](#cite_note-14) [[15]](#cite_note-15) [[16]](#cite_note-16) These two Abrahamic religions are widespread across Africa, though mostly concentrated in different areas. They have replaced indigenous African religions but are often adapted to African cultural contexts and belief systems. Abrahamic religious beliefs, especially monotheistic elements, such as the belief in a single creator god, was introduced into traditionally polytheistic African religions rather early. [[17]](#cite_note-17) Followers of traditional African religions are also found around the world. In recent times, religions, such as the [Yoruba](/wiki/Yoruba_religion) religion, are on the rise. The religion of the Yoruba is finding roots in the islands of the Caribbean and portions of Central and South America. In the [United States](/wiki/United_States), [Voodoo](/wiki/West_African_Vodun) is more predominant in the states along the Gulf of Mexico. [[18]](#cite_note-18) Basics[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Traditional_African_religions&action=edit\u00a7ion=2)] Highly complex [animistic beliefs](/wiki/Animism) builds the core concept of traditional African religions. This includes the worship of [tutelary deities](/wiki/Tutelary_deity), [nature worship](/wiki/Nature_worship), [ancestor worship](/wiki/Ancestor_worship) and the belief in an [afterlife](/wiki/Afterlife), comparable to other traditional/nature religions around the world, such as Japanese [Shinto](/wiki/Shinto) or [traditional European paganism](/wiki/Paganism). While some religions adopted a [pantheistic](/wiki/Pantheism) worldview with a supreme creator god next to other gods and spirits, others follow a purely [polytheistic](/wiki/Polytheistic) system with various gods, spirits and other [supernatural beings](/wiki/Supernatural_being). [[19]](#cite_note-19) Traditional African religions also have elements of [totemism](/wiki/Totemism), [shamanism](/wiki/Shamanism) and [veneration of relics](/wiki/Veneration_of_relics). [[20]](#cite_note-20) Traditional African religion, like most other ancient traditions around the world, were based on [oral traditions](/wiki/Oral_tradition). These traditions are not religious principles, but a cultural identity that is passed on through stories, myths and tales, from one generation to the next. The community and ones family, but also the environment, plays an important role in one's personal life. Followers believe in the guidance of their ancestors spirits. Among many traditional African religions, there are spiritual leaders and kinds of priests. These persons are essential in the spiritual and religious survival of the community. There are mystics that are responsible for healing and 'divining' - a kind of fortune telling and counseling, similar to [shamans](/wiki/Shamans). These traditional healers have to be called by ancestors or gods. They undergo strict training and learn many necessary skills, including how to use natural herbs for healing and other, more mystical skills, like the finding of a hidden object without knowing where it is. Traditional African religion believe that ancestors maintain a spiritual connection with their living relatives. Most ancestral spirits are generally good and kind. Negative actions taken by ancestral spirits is to cause minor illnesses to warn people that they have gotten onto the wrong path. [[21]](#cite_note-21) Native African religions are centered on [ancestor worship](/wiki/Ancestor_worship), the in a [spirit world](/wiki/Spirit_world_(Spiritualism)), [supernatural beings](/wiki/Supernatural_being) [free will](/wiki/Free_will) (unlike the later developed concept of [faith](/wiki/Faith)). Deceased humans (and animals or important objects) still exist in the spirit world and can influence or interact with the physical world. Forms of [polytheism](/wiki/Polytheism) was widespread in most of ancient African and other regions of the world, before the introduction of Islam, Christianity, and [Judaism](/wiki/Judaism). An exception was the short-lived monotheistic religion created by Pharaoh [Akhenaten](/wiki/Akhenaten), who made it mandatory to pray to his personal god [Aten](/wiki/Aten) (see [Atenism](/wiki/Atenism)). [[22]](#cite_note-22) This remarkable change to traditional Egyptian religion was however reverted by his youngest son, [Tutankhamun](/wiki/Tutankhamun). [[23]](#cite_note-23) [[24]](#cite_note-24) [[25]](#cite_note-25) [[26]](#cite_note-Okwu-26) High gods, along with other more specialized deities, ancestor spirits, territorial spirits, and beings, are a common theme among traditional African religions, highlighting the complex and advanced culture of ancient Africa. [[26]](#cite_note-Okwu-26) [[27]](#cite_note-27) [[28]](#cite_note-28) Some research suggests that certain monotheistic concepts, such as the belief in a high god or force (next to many other gods, deities and spirits, sometimes seen as intermediaries between humans and the creator) were present within Africa, before the introduction of Abrahamic religions. These indigenous concepts were different from the monotheism found in Abrahamic religions. [[26]](#cite_note-Okwu-26) [[29]](#cite_note-29) [[30]](#cite_note-convehret-30) [[31]](#cite_note-31) [Traditional African medicine](/wiki/Traditional_African_medicine) is also directly linked to traditional African religions. According to Clemmont E. Vontress, the various religious traditions of Africa are united by a basic [Animism](/wiki/Animism). According to him, the belief in spirits and ancestors is the most important element of African religions. Gods were either self-created or evolved from spirits or ancestors which got worshiped by the people. He also notes that most modern African folk religions were strongly influenced by non-African religions, mostly Christianity and Islam and thus may differ from the ancient forms. [[32]](#cite_note-32) Traditional African religions generally hold the beliefs of life after death (a spirit world or realms, in which spirits, but also gods reside), with some also having a concept of reincarnation, in which deceased humans may reincarnate into their family lineage (blood lineage), if they want to, or have something to do. [[33]](#cite_note-33) There are often similarities between traditional African religions located in the same [subregion](/wiki/Subregion#Africa). [Central Africa](/wiki/Central_Africa), for instance, has similar religious traditions in countries of the [Democratic Republic of the Congo](/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo), the [Burundi](/wiki/Burundi), [Zambia](/wiki/Zambia), and [Malawi](/wiki/Malawi). [[34]](#cite_note-:02-34) The people in these countries who follow traditional religious practices often [venerate](/wiki/Veneration_of_the_dead) [ancestors](/wiki/Ancestor) through [rituals](/wiki/Ritual) and worship the land or a \" [divinity](/wiki/Deity)\" through African religions at [Harvard University](/wiki/Harvard_University), summarized the many traditional African religions as complex [animistic](/wiki/Animism) religious traditions and beliefs of the African people before the Christian and Islamic \"colonization\" of Africa. [Ancestor veneration](/wiki/Ancestor_worship) has always played a \"significant\" part in the traditional African cultures and may be considered as central to the African worldview. Ancestors (ancestral ghosts/spirits) are an integral part of reality. The ancestors are generally believed to reside in an ancestral realm (spiritworld), while some believe that the ancestors became equal in power to deities. [[35]](#cite_note-:0-35) The defining line between deities and ancestors is often contested, but overall, ancestors are believed to occupy a higher level of existence than living human beings and are believed to be able to bestow either blessings or illness upon their living descendants. Ancestors can offer advice and bestow good fortune and honor to their living descendants, but they can also make demands, such as insisting that their shrines be properly maintained and propitiated. A belief in ancestors also testifies to the inclusive nature of traditional African spirituality by positing that deceased progenitors still play a role in the lives of their living descendants. Olupona rejects the western/Islamic definition of [monotheism](/wiki/Monotheism) and says that such concepts could not reflect the complex African traditions and are too simplistic. While some traditions have a supreme being (next to other deities), others have not. Monotheism does not reflect the multiplicity of ways that the traditional African spirituality has conceived of deities, gods, and spirit beings. He summarizes that traditional African religions are not only religions, but a worldview, a way of life. [[35]](#cite_note-:0-35) Ceremonies[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Traditional_African_religions&action=edit\u00a7ion=3)] West and Central African religious practices generally manifest themselves in communal ceremonies or divinatory rites in which members of the community, overcome by force (or ashe, nyama, etc.), are excited to the point of going into meditative trance in response to rhythmic or driving drumming or singing. One religious ceremony practiced in [Gabon](/wiki/Gabon) and [Cameroon](/wiki/Cameroon) is the [Okuyi](/wiki/Okuyi), practiced by several [Bantu](/wiki/Bantu_peoples) ethnic groups. In this state, depending upon the region, drumming or instrumental rhythms played by respected musicians (each of which is unique to a given deity or ancestor), participants embody a deity or ancestor, energy or state of mind by performing distinct ritual movements or dances which further enhance their elevated consciousness. [[36]](#cite_note-Karade,_B._pages_39-46-36) When this trance-like state is witnessed and understood, adherents are privy to a way of contemplating the pure or symbolic embodiment of a particular mindset or frame of reference. This builds skills at separating the feelings elicited by this mindset from their situational manifestations in daily life. Such separation and subsequent contemplation of the nature and sources of pure energy or feelings serves to help participants manage and accept them when they arise in mundane contexts. This facilitates better control and transformation of these energies into positive, culturally appropriate behavior, thought, and speech. Also, this practice can give rise to those in these trances uttering words which, when interpreted by a culturally educated initiate or diviner, can provide insight into appropriate directions which the community (or individual) might take in accomplishing its goal. [[37]](#cite_note-37) Spirits[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Traditional_African_religions&action=edit\u00a7ion=4)] Followers of traditional African religions pray to various spirits as well as to their [ancestors](/wiki/Amadlozi). [[38]](#cite_note-38) This includes also nature, elementary and animal spirits. The difference between powerful spirits and gods is often minimal. Most African societies believe in several \"high gods\" and a large amount of lower gods and spirits. There are also some religions with a single supreme being ( [Chukwu](/wiki/Chukwu), [Nyame](/wiki/Nyame), [Olodumare](/wiki/Olodumare), [Ngai](/wiki/Ngai), [Roog](/wiki/Roog), etc.). [[39]](#cite_note-39) god and goddess such as [Mawu-Lisa](/wiki/Mawu). [[40]](#cite_note-40) Traditional African religions generally believe in an [afterlife](/wiki/Afterlife), one or more [Spirit worlds](/wiki/Spirit_world_(Spiritualism)), and [Ancestor worship](/wiki/Ancestor_worship) is an important basic concept in mostly all African religions. Some African religions adopted different views through the influence of Islam or even Hinduism. [[41]](#cite_note-41) [[42]](#cite_note-42) Practices and rituals[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Traditional_African_religions&action=edit\u00a7ion=5)] There are more similarities than differences in all traditional African religions, [[43]](#cite_note-43) although [Jacob Olupona](/wiki/Jacob_Olupona) has written that it is difficult to truly generalize them because of the sheer amount of differences and variations between the traditions. [[44]](#cite_note-44) The deities and spirits are honored through [libation](/wiki/Libation) or sacrifice (of [animals](/wiki/Animal_sacrifice), vegetables, cooked food, flowers, semi-precious stones and precious metals). The will of the gods or spirits is sought by the believer also through consultation of divinities or [divination](/wiki/Divination). [[45]](#cite_note-45) Traditional African religions embrace natural phenomena - ebb and tide, waxing and waning moon, rain and drought - and the rhythmic pattern of agriculture. According to Gottlieb and Mbiti: The environment and nature are infused in every aspect of traditional African religions and culture. This is largely because cosmology and beliefs are intricately intertwined with the natural phenomena and environment. All aspects of weather, thunder, lightning, rain, day, moon, sun, stars, and so on may become amenable to control through the cosmology of African people. Natural phenomena are responsible for providing people with their daily needs. [[46]] For example, in the [Serer religion](/wiki/Serer_religion), one of the most sacred stars in the cosmos is called Yoonir ( [the Star of Sirius](/wiki/Sirius)). [[47]](#cite_note-47) With a long tradition, the Serer high priests and priestesses ( [Saltigue](/wiki/Saltigue)) deliver yearly sermons at the [Xooy](/wiki/Xooy) Ceremony (divination ceremony) in [Fatick](/wiki/Fatick) before Yoonir's phase in order to predict winter months and enable farmers to start planting. [[48]](#cite_note-48) [Traditional healers](/wiki/Traditional_healers_of_South_Africa) are common in most areas, and their practices include a religious element to varying degrees. Divination[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Traditional_African_religions&action=edit\u00a7ion=6)] Since Africa is a large continent with many ethnic groups and cultures, there is not one single technique of casting divination. The practice of casting may be done with small objects, such as bones, cowrie shells, stones, strips of leather, or flat pieces of wood. Some castings are done using sacred divination plates made of wood or performed on the ground (often within a circle). In traditional African societies, many people seek out diviners on a regular basis. There are generally no prohibitions against the practice. Diviner (also known as priest) are also sought for their wisdom as counselors in life and for their knowledge of herbal medicine. Ubuntu[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Traditional_African_religions&action=edit\u00a7ion=7)] Ubuntu is a [Nguni Bantu](/wiki/Nguni_languages) term meaning \"humanity\". It is sometimes translated as \"I am because we are\" (also \"I am because umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu). In [Xhosa](/wiki/Xhosa_language), the latter term is used, but is often meant in a more philosophical sense to mean \"the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity\". It is a collection of values and practices that people of Africa or of African origin view as making people authentic human beings. While the nuances of these values and practices vary across different ethnic groups, they all point to one thing - an authentic individual human being is part of a larger and more significant relational, communal, societal, environmental and spiritual world. [[49]](#cite_note-49) Virtue and vice[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Traditional_African_religions&action=edit\u00a7ion=8)] Virtue in traditional African religion is often connected with carrying out obligations of the communal aspect of life. Examples include social behaviors such as the respect for parents and elders, raising children appropriately, providing hospitality, and being honest, trustworthy, and courageous. In some traditional African religions, morality is associated with obedience or disobedience to God regarding the way a person or a community lives. For the [Kikuyu](/wiki/Kikuyu_people), according to their primary supreme [creator](/wiki/Creator_deity), [Ngai](/wiki/Ngai), acting through the lesser deities, is believed to speak to and be capable of guiding the virtuous person as one's conscience. In many cases, Africans who have converted to other religions have still kept up their traditional customs and practices, combining them in a [syncretic](/wiki/Syncretism) way. [[50]](#cite_note-50) Sacred places[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Traditional_African_religions&action=edit\u00a7ion=9)] Some sacred or holy locations for traditional religions [edit](/w/index.php?title=Traditional_African_religions&action=edit\u00a7ion=10)] Traditional African religions have faced [persecution](/wiki/Religious_persecution) from Christians and Muslims. [[51]](#cite_note-51) [[52]](#cite_note-52) Adherents of these religions have been [forcefully converted](/wiki/Forced_conversion) to [Islam](/wiki/Islam) and [Christianity](/wiki/Christianity), demonized and [marginalized](/wiki/Marginalized). [[53]](#cite_note-53) The atrocities include killings, waging war, destroying of sacred places, and other atrocities. [[54]](#cite_note-54) [[55]](#cite_note-55) Because of persecution and discrimination, as well as incompatibility with traditional society, culture and native beliefs, the [Dinka people](/wiki/Dinka_people) largely rejected or ignored Islamic and Christian teachings. [[56]](#cite_note-56) Traditions by region[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Traditional_African_religions&action=edit\u00a7ion=11)] This list is limited to a few well-known traditions. Central Africa[ [Punic religion](/wiki/Punic_religion)(Tunisia, Algeria, Libya) [Traditional Berber religion](/wiki/Traditional_Berber_religion)(Morocco (including Western Sahara), Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Chad, Burkina Faso) Southern Africa[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Traditional_African_religions&action=edit\u00a7ion=15)] South Africa) [Traditional healers [Godianism](/wiki/Godianism)(a religion that is purported to encompass all traditional religions of Africa, primarily based on Odinala) [West African mythology](/wiki/West_African_mythology)(the umbrella term of all traditional [Igbo a [creator deity](/wiki/Creator_deity) along with a [pantheon](/wiki/Pantheon_(religion)) of divine spirits such as the [Orisha](/wiki/Orisha), [Loa](/wiki/Loa), [Vodun](/wiki/Vodun), [Nkisi](/wiki/Nkisi) and [Alusi](/wiki/Alusi), among others. In addition to the [religious syncretism](/wiki/Religious_syncretism) of these various African traditions, many also incorporate elements of [Folk Catholicism](/wiki/Folk_Catholicism) including [folk saints](/wiki/Folk_saint) [Entheogens](/wiki/Entheogen)) and [European folklore](/wiki/European_folklore). Various \"doctoring\" spiritual traditions also exist such as [Obeah](/wiki/Obeah) and [Hoodoo](/wiki/Hoodoo_(folk_magic)) which focus on spiritual health. [[57]](#cite_note-57) African religious traditions in the Americas can vary. They can have non-prominent African roots or can be almost wholly African in nature, such as religions like [Trinidad Orisha](/wiki/Trinidad_Orisha). University Press.
