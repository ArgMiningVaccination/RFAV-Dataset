Evidence-Based Treatments Offered Japanese Style Acupuncture Because of its delicacy and precision Japanese or meridian style acupuncture is essentially painless. Patients who refer their entire family can attest to the fact that it doesn't have to hurt to be successful. Patients often experience profound relaxation. That relaxation leads to physiological and psychological healing that drugs have difficulty in matching. In Japan Oriental Medicine is called the medicine of vital energy. Japanese style acupuncture specializes in effectively moving and balancing that energy without depleting it. That is why it has the flexibility to treat so many Illnesses and pain conditions. Nutritional Counseling This consultation is Condition Focused on a specific diagnosis such as: The session can be in the office or virtual. Each will be an hour long and will include diet and lifestyle changes, herb & supplement suggestions, recipes and further testing if indicated. We can also create a protocol tailored to your diagnosis. Vitamins and Supplements We are not a fan of \"more is better\" when it comes to vitamins and supplements. There are, however, a few things that we feel most people should take. Usually supplements will be suggested to treat a suspected deficiency or as a temporary support for a health or mood problem. We will also help you streamline your supplement routine and make sure you are getting what you are paying for. Herbal Formulas Herbs are used in combinations according to principles perfected over 3000 years of study. The use of herbal medicinals has reached highly sophisticated levels in Oriental Medicine. It's versatility and lack of side effects makes this a great place to start when you are looking for improved health or relief of symptoms. Essential Oils Essential Oils have a wide range of therapeutic properties. They can be chosen and combined according to the principles of Oriental Medicine, then applied to areas or points on the body to stimulate or soothe. Oils can be used with or without needles. We consider them a form of herbal therapy. Far Infrared Therapy This is a modality that is used to reduce inflammation so it is very effective in treating chronic conditions especially pain of all kinds. It can be combined with other forms of treatment to enhance healing and relaxing. Microcurrent Soothes away pain and creates healing by enhancing communication between cells and circulation. Microcurrent works by mimicking the natural energy at a cellular level. It can also be used to stimulate acupuncture points without needles. Gua Sha Gua sha is a simple and painless treatment for inflammation, muscle tightness, immunity, and pain relief. Research is revealing that most chronic health problems are caused by persistent low level inflammation. Facial Acupuncture The AcuFacial is a natural, effective treatment to enhance skin glow, texture, elasticity, and recovery while simultaneously addressing internal, whole body imbalances. Cupping This technique may be likened to a mini deep tissue massage and are effective to relieve many types of pain by increasing blood flow in specific areas. It is also very effective for venting chest colds and coughs. About Us Melody Pickell MSTOM, L.Ac. Melody offers a unique combination of western and eastern experience.

Susie R., Los Osos, CA I am new to acupuncture and I've been reluctant to get stuck with needles, so I never went. I decided to try acupuncture for a long run of insomnia I've been experiencing. Kelly Thomas is awesome! She's an incredible listener, she is easy to talk with and offers sage advice. She puts those needles in swiftly and with ease. The whole experience was wonderful every time, and I generally would nap on the table feeling warm under the red light, with nice music playing in the background. Kelly helped me figure out some supplements, she provided samples too. I am still taking the supplements Adrenal plus that she prescribed and I feel they really help me. Kelly, treated my whole body and I frequently left her office with acupuncture to go for an aching shoulder. I definitely recommend Kelly and Healing Alternatives and I will use their services again! Mary C., Avila Beach, CA Melody is just amazing! I have only gone in a couple of times so far, but I am in awe of the results. From the start, she has always listened thoroughly to my symptoms and provided so much insight as the what the cause could be for various \"issues\" I had. I'm just amazed at how she is able to quickly determine the cause and effect on my body. It's so refreshing to focus on fixing the symptoms rather that patching over the problems. When performing acupuncture, Melody always explains what she is doing and I appreciate that so much because I both learn about the practice more and am able to relax better. The herbs she has recommended for me have been wondrous and like I mentioned before, I'm just in awe of her. Tina S., San Luis Obispo, CA Melody is an amazing and gifted woman -- loved her approach. She listened intently and never made me feel rushed. Her office staff was delightful and organized. The consultation was very thorough and the treatment was relaxing and I left the office feeling calm and relaxed which generally are not descriptive words associated with my name. I will be a very loyal and long time customer of Healing Alternatives. Eric B., San Luis Obispo, CA Kelly Thomas is amazing!!! I say that with 3 exclamation points because honestly she's a healer. I've had 2 back surgeries, several fractures, arthritis all over and after seeing Kelly, I feel 20 years younger within an hour or so of our session. She finds all your sore points and like a magic, bam! It's gone. Thank you so much Kelly, you're the best. I wouldn't be able to do the hiking and activities I do without your service Nan H., Santa Barbara, CA I have been seeing Melody for about five years. First, her treatments healed my chronic bronchitis when no other treatment (east or west) could do it. Recently, her treatments have helped boost my immune system, increase my energy, and relieve stress. She is wonderful! Highly recommend! Melissa H., Santa Rosa, CA I originally found Melody when I had severe knee pain and she helped me regain mobility without medication. I felt better after each session and am grateful for having found someone to help me overcome problems with pain.
