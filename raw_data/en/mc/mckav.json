Our team utilizes both conventional medical approaches and evidence-based complementary therapies. What does integrative medicine primary care (IMPC) offer? - Holistic care for acute, complex and chronic medical conditions, as well annual physicals, health maintenance and immunizations. - Personalized preventive care, nutritional support, behavioral health services, fitness planning, group visits and health education. - A team dedicated to exploring all avenues of health and healing in partnership with you. - Same-day appointments, extended office hours and convenient parking. - Lifestyle and wellness programs. - Access to leading integrative medicine experts for consultations and second opinions. - In-house lab testing and onsite store. Additionally, primary care provides a gateway to a healing community of in-house practitioners for acupuncture, chiropractic care, Ayurveda, nutrition, psychotherapy, massage, bodywork and skin care therapies. What makes this model unique? We go beyond standard primary care guidelines to consider your mind, body and spirit in our assessments and care. Your physician-led primary care team focuses on optimal health as it partners with you to create personalized care plans. Your path to wellness is based on your own definition of health and can include goals like changing lifestyle and behavior, feeling more spiritually fulfilled, and increasing physical comfort, energy and vitality. We offer evidence-based holistic treatment options onsite and easy access to a variety of services, such as Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine, osteopathy, chiropractic care, massage, nutrition and more, coordinated by your primary care team. What can I expect during my first appointment? All of our primary care providers believe that physical, mental, emotional, relational and spiritual factors comprise your health. They also believe you can participate in care planning and can help define your health goals. You can expect your first visit to be 60 minutes long and to include a comprehensive assessment of the factors mentioned above, as well as sleep, stress management, nutrition and exercise. You will also address any specific health concerns you may have. Based on this visit, you may be referred to other team members, such as an osteopathic physician or medical acupuncturist to help with pain management, a nurse practitioner who focuses on nutrition and mind-body therapies, or even a social worker who can help you make changes and identify community resources. Who is on my team? How often will we meet? Your goals, preferences and initial assessment guide your care team composition. Your team may include your physician as lead, and various other practitioners to support your personal health plan. You can meet with your team annually for your comprehensive physical, or you may visit more frequently based on your needs. Do I get to choose my primary care doctor or nurse practitioner? Yes, and we are happy to help you with that decision based on your preferences. Can I see another doctor or nurse practitioner if mine is unavailable? Yes. Our team approach means that multiple providers are available for you, when you need them. What if I have a chronic medical condition? The primary care team will address your condition, see you as frequently as necessary, refer you to on-site practitioners or outside specialists as appropriate, and closely coordinate all of your care. What if I want to receive treatment outside of the Institute for Health & Healing? With your approval, your IHH team can coordinate care with any external provider. Can I get basic medical procedures like pap smears or blood pressure screenings? Yes. If I'm sick, can I get a same-day appointment? Yes. We offer same-day appointments as needed. What are your hours? We are open Monday and Thursday from 8:30 am to 6:00 pm. On Tuesday and Friday we are open from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm. The lab draw hours are Monday through Friday from 8:00 am to 4:30 pm (the last draw is at 4:15 pm). Wednesday hours are 8:00 am to 5:30 pm. Can I communicate with my doctor or nurse practitioner and make appointments online? Yes. Please go to [myhealthonline.sutterhealth.org](http://myhealthonline.sutterhealth.org) webpage. What if I already have a primary care physician but wish to transfer care to IHH? If you have a PPO, POS or Medicare plan, you may join our primary care practice whenever you like. If you have an HMO, you will need to contact your insurance provider to learn more. Should you choose to retain your existing primary care provider, IHH specialty consultation and treatments are still available to you. How is the primary care clinic different from the existing IHH clinics in San Francisco, Marin, Santa Rosa and Sacramento? Currently the San Francisco clinic (and the clinics in Marin, Santa Rosa and Sacramento) provide a wide range of integrative medical options. The addition of primary care represents a significant expansion of our services at that location. The existing clinics will continue to provide care regardless of where patients receive primary care and will serve as a resource for IMPC patients for treatment and therapies recommended by their IMPC physician or nurse practitioner. How does primary care connect to the specialty practice? Your IHH primary care provider may want to coordinate your care with IHH specialists for in-depth assessment and/or treatment. You may receive a referral for services in Functional Medicine, Osteopathy, Traditional Chinese Medicine & Acupuncture, Chiropractic Services, Ayurveda, Integrative Psychotherapy, Massage & and Bodywork Therapies, Nutrition and Skin Care. Your primary care provider and/or team will remain involved in your care and coordinate all activities to help you achieve your health goals. Can I continue to make appointments with IHH providers in the existing specialty clinics if I don't have or want a primary care physician? Yes, we will continue to provide the same high-quality integrative medicine consultation and treatment that we currently offer in IHH clinics. Many people retain their longstanding relationship with their primary care providers. Will insurance cover my IHH primary care? If you have a PPO, POS or Medicare plan, we can bill your insurer for services in the primary care clinic. If you have an HMO plan or Kaiser insurance, we are considered out of network. In that case, you can participate as a self-pay patient. If I get a referral from my IHH primary care physician to an IHH specialty clinic, will my insurance cover the therapies I receive there? PPO and POS insurance plans and Medicare cover in-depth assessment or treatment from our specialty physicians and nurse practitioners. Coverage for complementary therapies like acupuncture, psychotherapy and chiropractic services depend on your individual plan. Contact your insurer or your employer's benefits representative for details. "}
