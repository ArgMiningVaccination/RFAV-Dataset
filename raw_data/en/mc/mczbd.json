Inc. | Acupuncture in Tampa, Florida", "date": "2017-05-04", "cleaned_text": "Our exposure to toxins increases dramatically each year as more and more chemical substances are dumped our environment, our food, medicines, and ultimately, into our bodies. Our liver and detoxification systems are overburdened with the ingestion of prescription and over-the-counter drugs. The quality of our food supply continues to be depleted of minerals and antioxidants which are critical for our detoxification process. As our bodies are asked to handle more toxins with fewer nutrients the result is an accumulation of toxins in our tissues. Most if not all chronic degenerative diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes, arthritis, cataracts, obesity, senility, depression, autoimmune disorders and allergies, to name but a few are the result of the increasing toxicity of our environment. We use a detoxification program that is a multidimensional approach that gently yet effectively supports your body's natural detoxification process without directly provoking the release of stored toxins with which your body may not be ready or able to process. With our detoxification program you can safely and comfortably improve your body's ability to detoxify without the 'toxic' symptoms commonly experienced with other detoxification programs. - support healing and recovery from an illness - initiate or support a healthy weight loss program - reveal underlying health challenges that may be masked by an overly toxic system - prevent health problems from occurring by reducing toxicity before you feel sick. You will notice as you read about our various services that they interact and support each other in a holistic approach to physical and mental health and harmony. "}
