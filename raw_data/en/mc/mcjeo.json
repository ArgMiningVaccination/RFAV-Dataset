During my studies at Erasmus School of Health Policy & Management (Rotterdam), I had to write a critical reflection paper on the subject. Later that same year, I switched jobs and started as programme manager with ZonMw, the Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development. One of the programmes I was responsible for was the so-called KKCZ-programme (Kennisbeleid, Kwaliteit Curatieve Zorg (Knowledge management, Quality Curative Care)) which was chaired by professor Ton Casparie. He was responsible for bringing the quality (management) movement and clinical practice guidelines to the Netherlands. The KKCZ-programme entailed the development of multidisciplinary clinical practice guidelines while also introducing innovative elements as patient involvement, taking into account the social and labour participation by patients, as well cost effectiveness of the recommendation. Up until then clinical practice guidelines, further referred to by the acronym CPG, were mainly characterized by a monodisciplinary approach and patient participation was virtually non-existent. The Dutch Ministry of Health, wellbeing and sports thought it important that CPGs should reflect the ever- increasing multidisciplinary setting of (health) care (delivery) and the added value of patient involvement. In addition, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment felt that CPGs should regard health from a broader perspective than just curative care aspects (2, 3). Therefore, both ministries commissioned and funded this guideline programme. Adding patient involvement and the effect of health care on labour and social participation to clinical practice guidelines, turned out for me to be an early introduction to patient engagement, and maybe even shared decision-making (SDM). However, the concept of shared decision- making and its abbreviation SDM were not mainstream in the Netherlands yet. As a follow-up, the Ministry of Health installed the Council for the Quality of Care in 2009. This was an advisory board to the Minister of Health for which I was - together with Jannes van Everdingen - executive secretary. The task of the Council for the Quality of Care was to: -Enter on the agenda bottlenecks concerning clinical practice guideline development and implementation; -Support healthcare professional associations by providing guidance in CPG development and developing procedures to solve the bottlenecks mentioned above; -Encourage healthcare professional associations in dealing with these bottlenecks (4). One of the bottlenecks was that the development of CPGs in the Netherlands was being left to the own accord of the parties involved. Besides the agreement that guideline development should be evidence-based (5), there was no nationwide consensus on the criteria which had to be met when developing clinical practice guidelines. To tackle this, the Working Group Guideline for Guidelines was formed by the Council . Members of the working group were representatives from the various care domains, such as long term care, public health, primary and secondary care, as well as experts on guideline development and implementation. Some of the represented domains were forerunners in CPG development, such as the Dutch College of General Practitioners and the medical specialists. The main legacy of the working group is the Chapter 1 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 15DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 15 25-9-2020 00:42:0525-9-2020 00:42:0516 16 'Guideline for Guidelines', which stipulates 20 criteria for the development and implementation of clinical practice guidelines. The working group also more or less addressed shared decision- making; criterion 16 states that the guideline development project delivers products that are tuned to the needs of the healthcare professionals as well as patients, and which enhance the use of said guideline. Examples are: a patient version of the guideline, patient decision aids, patient materials to inform and educate, and other tools that promote self-management and shared decision-making by the professional and patient (6). The Working Group Guideline for Guidelines also adapted the existing Dutch 'Haamstede'- definition of a CPG, stemming from 2004: \"A CPG is a document with recommendations, advice and acting instructions to support the decision-making of healthcare professionals and patients, based on the results of scientific research and subsequent discussion and forming of opinion, aimed at making effective and efficient clinical care explicit.\" (7). The members of the working group decided to align it more with the international consensus on what a CPG is, and updated the new definition using the one from Institute of Medicine (IoM) (2011). The new 'Brummelen'- definition of a CPG was: \"A CPG is a document with recommendations, aimed at improving the quality of care, based upon systematic summaries of scientific research and the assessment of pros and cons of the various care options, supplemented with the expertise and experience of healthcare professionals and patients.\" (6). By doing so, the working group intended to shift the focus of CPGs from predominantly research evidence to include clinical practice and patient preferences as well. They decided to do this partly because a review of 62 CPGs commissioned by the Council showed that CPGs had low(er) AGREE-scores (Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation instrument) when less hard scientific evidence was available, as is often the case with input generated by patient involvement or other end users, and with topics related to organisation of care (8). Another bottleneck the Council recognized was a lack of consistency in the language and terminology being used regarding quality of care. The Council assembled a glossary of 1,000 words used in the quality of care discourse and added descriptions (9). Together with the participants of the Keizer Karel conference in 2009 100 from those 1,000 words were chosen as the most important ones (10) and both lists were published so that everybody working in care could get acquainted with these terms and definitions. The online glossary also provided the possibility to comment on the descriptions and add new words (11), as any language is dynamic; meanings change, words disappear and new ones are introduced. SDM was not mainstream in 2006, but since then it had picked up pace and in 2011 the international conference on SDM took place in the Netherlands: 'Bridging the gap towards SDM: patient pull or clinician push?'. However, at the end of the ISDM-conference, the Dutch participants had to conclude that the Netherlands were not ready for nationwide implementation of shared decision-making. Before this was possible, concerted action was needed. For example, by educating professionals, further empowering of patients and making high quality decision support tools such as patient decision aids (PDAs) publicly accessible. At the end of 2012, it became clear that the Ministry of Health persevered in merging several councils and platforms dedicated to improving the quality of care. The Council for the Quality Chapter 1 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 16DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 16 25-9-2020 00:42:0525-9-2020 00:42:0517 of Care and the other platforms were merged with the then Health Care Insurance Board (CVZ) resulting in the new National Health Care Institute (ZIN). This institute was assigned to maintain the quality, accessibility and aff ordability of health care in the Netherlands. Specifi cally, for the task health care quality, which was where I was assigned to, it had - and has - to contribute to good health care by helping the parties involved to continually improve health care and help patients fi nd their way to good-quality care. The institute therefore: Encourages and supports healthcare parties responsible to develop quality standards, such as CPGs, and relevant measurement tools; -Encourages healthcare parties to comply with these quality standards; -Provides insight into the quality of care provided. This information helps patients make choices in health care and facilitates the supervision of health care (12). -At the institute, I was lead of the project with the aim to develop a long-term agenda for clinical practice guideline development and implementation in the Netherlands (also known as Meerjarenagenda). Looking back, 2011/2012 turned out to be a pivotal year. Six years after being introduced to the world of clinical practice guidelines, it had been expanded with the worlds such as knowledge, quality of care, evidence-based medicine, shared decision-making and implementation. It had also sparked my interest in (the eff ect of) language. Figure 1: Worlds in health care During those years, I have had the chance to work with a multitude of people and parties from various backgrounds such as healthcare professionals, patients, payers, administrators, and politicians. Moreover, I encountered them in various settings: research, policy and practice. People and parties with diff erent expertise as knowledge production, tool development, implementation, monitoring, quality improvement and communication, but also people and parties with their own perspectives, stakes, expectations and terminology. For me these worlds felt as one, but while navigating these worlds I noticed this was not the case for everyone. In the next part, I will off er a glimpse into these worlds (see fi gure 1). Chapter 1 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 17DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 17 25-9-2020 00:42:0625-9-2020 00:42:061818 The world of knowledge A lot of research is carried out in health care. This research aims primarily to fi nd out new knowledge that could lead to changes in treatments, policies or care. Many diff erent types of research exist: from studies in a scientifi c laboratory to those that observe and examine people with diff erent conditions, and to develop new treatments. Researchers look into preventing or curing disease, promoting good health, or fi nding out patients' experience of diff erent care services and support in the community (13). All this research leads to a vast knowledge base. And this knowledge base accumulates fast daily. Bastian, Glasziou and Chalmers showed in 2007 that every day 75 trials and 11 systematic reviews are published (see fi gure 2) (14). Since then, these numbers have been increasing steadily (15, 16). Articles and systematic reviews indexed in Medline (PubMed), 1994-2013 (17) Figure 2: The increasing volume of research evidence (based on: Grattan Institute, report Questionable care, 2015) For example, if a cardiac imaging specialist wants to stay up to date she or he needs to read 30 papers a week on echocardiography or 43 a week on multimodality imaging. Time that cannot be spent with patients. Sackett et al indicated already over 30 years ago that it would be impossible for clinicians to stay abreast of the developments in their fi eld (16). That clinicians have been indicating for years that they feel overburdened by information should therefore be no surprise (18, 19). The 'phrase information overload' was already coined in 1970 (15); a more modern typology could be that healthcare professionals suff er from 'info-besitas' (20). One of the best-known responses to this information overload was the founding of the Cochrane Collaboration in 1993. It was named after the Scottish clinician and epidemiologist Archie Cochrane who called for a critical summary of all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCT) that is adapted periodically. Realizing that most of the information was of poor quality, to him it made no sense for healthcare professionals to try and read everything. Therefore, they should be able to rely on critical summaries (16, 21). Chapter 1 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 18DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 18 25-9-2020 00:42:0625-9-2020 00:42:0619 Furthermore, research has shown that it usually takes approximately 17 years before research results fi nd their way into healthcare practice (22, 23). Meaning that the translation, or implementation of this knowledge, takes 17 years before it is used in practice and reaches patients. Figure 3: Leaks in the evidence pipeline from research to daily practice (based on Glasziou & Haynes, BMJ Evidence-based Nursing, 2005) To make matters worse, other research pointed out that the pipeline through which the knowledge fl ows is a leaking pipeline. At every step of the knowledge translation process due to various reasons and blockages knowledge drips away and does not reach daily practice (see fi gure 3) (24, 25). The starting point of 'valid research' in fi gure 2 is essential as will become clear in the next world. The world of evidence-based medicine Another world in health care is evidence-based medicine (EBM). EBM is nowadays omnipresent in health care. Sackett et al in 1996 described evidence-based medicine as integrating \"the best external evidence with individual clinical expertise and patients' choice\" (see fi gure 4) (26). Over the years, however, it has become clear that EBM did not completely deliver on its promise. The pillar 'research evidence' has received much more emphasis than the other two pillars, especially in evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. This emphasis on research evidence is troublesome for several reasons. One reason being that certain patient groups, such as women, minorities, children, and the elderly, were and still are often underrepresented or excluded from research trials. Another reason is that multi-morbidity is not taken into account (27). The applicability of the research results for certain patient groups is therefore limited. Contrary to Sackett et al's intentions, a hierarchy of evidence has (unintentionally) evolved in EBM. Perhaps infl uenced by Cochrane's emphasis on summarizing RCTs, most in the EBM-community Figure 4: Three pillars of evidence-based medicine (based on Sackett et 19DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 00:42:0720 20 regard systematic reviews and randomized clinical trials as the highest level of evidence. This has led to a disregard of other evidence, such as qualitative research. Another reason for the overreliance on research evidence is that research has shown that a very low percentage of studies in most medical journals meet the strict scientific standards. Ioannidis claimed in 2005 that most published research findings were false (28, 29). Chalmers et al added to this that patients and healthcare professionals are not involved in setting the research agenda, which means that research questions relevant to these groups are not being studied (as much) and important outcomes to patients and professionals are not addressed. Moreover, there exists a publication bias. In 2011, Schunemann et al reported that over half of the studies has never been published in full and studies with disappointing results were underreported (30, 31). The research evidence we use is biased. That makes the other pillars in EBM even more important. In addition, because e.g. not everything can be studied in a RCT, it is hard for clinicians to predict the preferences of patients whilst deciding about their care (32), and in daily practice, it is essential to be able to translate the knowledge to the individual patient using also clinical expertise. The world of clinical practice guidelines Another approach to translate knowledge into practice are clinical practice guidelines. CPGs distil, synthesize and interpret the best available evidence. The tool clinical practice guideline serves several purposes. The most important one being, as stated by the IoM in 1990: \"... to assist practitioner and patient [making] decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances\" (33). A lot of medical associations regard CPGs as a way to professionalize and to lay a sound foundation for their quality of care (34). This way, CPGs contribute to 1/ maintaining the level of quality of care; 2/ the warranted uniformization of care nationwide (by decreasing unwarranted practice variation (35)); and 3/ make more effective use of health care resources (36). The adherence to CPGs can be assessed during peer reviews or medical audits, which makes CPGs part of the quality (improvement) cycle (PDCA-cycle). Professionals can be held accountable for their performance by their peers and management (37). Other parties can also employ CPGs. The government can decide on reimbursement and health coverage using CPGs, and healthcare insurers can use them for contracting healthcare providers. However, not everybody is pleased when CPGs are being used for other purposes than the intended ones (38, 39). Even though the earliest developed clinical practice guidelines are completely different from the recent ones - progressing from consensus guidelines to evidence-based guidelines - and despite all the CPG-improvements over the years regarding content and methodology (40) (41), the implementation of CPGs still leaves room for improvement (35, 42, 43). Possible reasons are that healthcare professionals e.g. worry that CPGs are conducive to \"cookbook medicine\", decrease their autonomy and income, conflicts of interests are not always made transparent, and increase medico-legal liability. Furthermore, CPGs can rarely define optimal care with certainty, due to poor science, imperfect analytic processes, and differences in patients (44). These concerns were voiced in the early 1990s and still echo in 2010s (45). The earlier mentioned review of 62 clinical practice guidelines also showed that not all knowledge sources are used when developing CPGs, begging the question how evidence-based and applicable Chapter 1 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 20DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 20 25-9-2020 00:42:0725-9-2020 00:42:0721 they really are. This outcome led to the establishment of a new G-I-N Working Group: WG Appraising and Including Different (AID) Knowledge. This working group aims to identify methods and promising initiatives for appraising and including a wider range of knowledge sources in CPGs (46-48). Another outcome of the review was the lack of public and patient involvement in CPG development and implementation. This issue is addressed by the G-I-N Working Group Public which already exists longer (49). The dissatisfaction with CPGs, and other drawbacks such as keeping CPGs up to date, lack of patient perspective, and attention to organisation of care, has led to the development of other types of tools for knowledge translation and decision support. Some examples: care standards are written from a patient perspective and include organisation of care (50); clinical pathways are local complex interventions for mutual decision making and care processes (51); viewpoints offer quickly developed guidance when the evidence is not (fully) available yet (52); and patient decision aids help patients to become involved in decision making about their care and/or treatment by providing information about the options and outcomes, and clarify personal values (53). The world of shared decision-making Shared decision-making has been advocated as the ideal model of decision-making in the medical encounter (54-56). The concept got a boost in 1999 when Charles et al described three approaches to decision-making: paternalistic, shared and informed. In the first one, the clinician provides information about the options, deliberates and decides. In the latter, the clinician provides information about the options, but the patient deliberates and decides. In the shared approach both exchange information - the clinician about the options, the patient about what matters most to her or him -, both consider the pros and cons, and the final decision involves the patient as much as possible (and as much as the patient desires) (57). Other boosts were the (repeated) Cochrane reviews of patient decision aids showing the benefits of these tools towards SDM (58) and the realisation of the International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS) by O'Connor et al (59, 60). O'Connor and Wennberg pushed matters further along when they made a plea for informed patient choice (instead of informed consent). Governments took a keen interest as research showed that PDAs not only improve the quality of decision making but might also have an effect on health costs as informed patients in general chose more conservatively (35, 61). Governments, however, also acknowledged that if they wanted to pay tribute to all the domains of quality of care, and especially the domain patient-centeredness (62), formal patient engagement is essential (63-65) and SDM is one way to achieve this. Patient-centeredness is \"providing care respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values, and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions\" (62). Furthermore, patients were adamantly calling for a power shift in health care (66). Especially because even though SDM was receiving more attention and gaining momentum, considering patient preferences and values was still not standard operating procedure yet, although most clinicians thought they were involving patients in deciding about their care (63, 67-69). The increased attention to the involvement of patients in the care process and decision-making has led to new tools. Examples of these include patient decision aids, option grids, decision boxes, question prompt lists, patient education, and patient versions of clinical practice guidelines (7). Chapter 1 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 21DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 21 25-9-2020 00:42:0725-9-2020 00:42:0722 22 The world of tools To deal with the vast accumulating knowledge, tools are being developed. Tools such as systematic reviews, evidence summaries and meta-analyses mean that healthcare professionals do no longer need to read and interpret all the articles and research themselves. To help them further, clinical practice guidelines are developed. This tool type not only distils and synthesises knowledge it also interprets it. To help inform, educate, engage and support the patient and healthcare professionals to use the knowledge during patient encounters (patient) decision aids are developed as tools. The previous paragraphs have already mentioned several different tool types. However, if you look at a random website of a health profession association or ask around, one encounters more tool types. That begs the questions: how many tool types to support knowledge translation and support (shared) decision-making are out there?; are they different tool types, or just clad with different names; what purposes do they serve?; do professionals and patients know all these tools exist, and if yes, how do they deal with all these tools or tool types? Research into the tool type 'clinical pathway' revealed 84 names for tools with a similar meaning (70). Research into patient decision aids showed similar results (58). Are we, trying to resolve the information and knowledge overload by swamping our healthcare professionals, and maybe even the patients nowadays, with all sorts of knowledge translation and decision support tool types? Another dimension of the tools is their development process and the criteria they must meet to be regarded as trustworthy. For the development of the tool types, CPGs and PDAs rules and international criteria are available (6, 59, 71). But how about the other tool types? Moreover, are the existing tool types interconnected with each other? The world of clinical practice From bench to bedside is a well-known phrase in health care. It refers to \"the process by which the results of research done in the laboratory are directly used to develop new ways to treat patients\" (72). It is mainly used in the biomedical domain, but the phrase could be expanded to the broader knowledge base and knowledge sources (73). Researchers, epidemiologists, administrative and policy workers, tool developers, and implementation experts mainly inhabit the worlds described above. Even though we acknowledge that healthcare professionals and patients should be more involved in setting research agendas, developing tools, and implementation strategies, the ones that are involved make up only a small proportion of the ones that are out in the real world. It is up to all those in the real world to try stay abreast of all the knowledge, and use it accordingly, with or without the help of tools. The latter being almost impossible. Despite all efforts, it still takes knowledge ('bench') a long time to reach practice ('bedside'), as was mentioned before, and the use of available tools in daily practice is lagging. There still seems to be a gap between research, tools and practice. Aim and research questions How can we make all the knowledge in health care available to healthcare professionals and patients in a timely matter and in such a way that it is easy to digest and apply? Which tool types to translate knowledge and support (shared) decision-making do we need and are suitable? How do we develop them so that target users know that they can rely on them? Chapter 1 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 22DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 22 25-9-2020 00:42:0725-9-2020 00:42:0723 Moreover, how do we best disclose the knowledge and the tools? Compared to the 20th century, there are much more opportunities now with the internet and ICT. The aim of this PhD-research is fourfold. Firstly, tool types are no longer developed without a clear definition and use. Secondly, there exists a common terminology when referring to tool types. Thirdly, to make better use of the different knowledge sources available, and finally provide healthcare professionals and patients, and possibly other users such as policy advisors and insurers, with a set of pragmatic tools that covers their needs in knowledge translation and (shared) decision support. This has led to the following research questions: 1. What tool types to translate knowledge and support (shared) decision-making are available to healthcare professionals (and patients) in the Netherlands? 2. How are these tool types defined and does consensus exist on the definitions across the healthcare domains in the Netherlands? 3. Which criteria do these tool types need to meet and which purposes do they serve so that healthcare professionals and patients consider them trustworthy and useful? 4. Do we consider all knowledge sources when developing tools, and what does that mean for tool development? 5. What are healthcare professionals' needs using tools for knowledge translation and shared decision-making? Outline of thesis This thesis exists of several chapters. After this introduction, the second chapter describes the results of the scoping review into tool types available to healthcare professionals and patients that support knowledge transfer and (shared) decision-making (research question 1 and 2). The Delphi study carried out after the review aimed to limit the number of tool types and to achieve national consensus on the definitions of these tools and is covered in chapter three (research question 2 and 3). Chapter four presents the conceptual framework on patient-directed knowledge tools - detailing purposes and core elements of these tools - which was developed by a group of international experts during a consensus-based evidence informed meeting (research question 3). Chapter five explores the different kinds of knowledge being used in clinical practice guidelines and how this affects, or should affect the development of clinical practice guidelines (research question 4). In chapter six, interviewed paediatricians reflect firstly on the clinical practice guideline 'Palliative care for children' that attempted to integrate shared decision-making into the guideline, and secondly on other strategies in which guidelines can be adapted to enhance shared decision-making (research question 5). Finally, chapter seven provides a summary of findings and contains the general discussion addressing the outcomes and implications for daily practice, as well as suggestions for future research.

Unfortunately, it seems that in the Netherlands, and possibly elsewhere, the amount of different knowledge tool types makes it difficult to see the forest through the trees. Methods A scoping review, exploring types of knowledge tools available to Dutch clinicians (and patients) and how these tools are described. The search terms were collected from thesauri and textbooks, and used to search the websites and documents of selected national tool developing organisations. Results The review yielded 126 tool types. We included 67 different tool types, such as guidelines, protocols, standards and clinical pathways. Half of those tool types were aimed at clinicians, 14 at patients and 18 at both. In general, descriptions of the tool types were hard to find or incomplete. Conclusions There exists a myriad of knowledge tool types and their descriptions are mostly unclear. The information overload experienced by clinicians is not addressed effectively by developing numerous unclearly defined knowledge tools. We recommend limiting the number of tool types and making a greater effort in clearly defining them. This abundance of poorly defined tools does not seem to be restricted to the Netherlands. Keywords guidelines; Background Doctors have been signalling for years that they feel overburdened by information (18, 19, 74) and that they are suffering from 'infobesity' (16). Sackett indicated more than 20 years ago that it is impossible for doctors to stay abreast of the developments in their field (75). The already vast knowledge in health care is expanding daily - in 2010, 11 systematic reviews were published every day (14) - so that keeping up with developments is a challenge (15, 24). The development of so-called knowledge tools is intended to support clinicians (and patients) to keep pace and to improve their decision-making (76, 77). In addition to knowledge tool types such as evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (CPG), however, protocols, guidance, standards, clinical pathways and many other tool types have been developed over the years. With the rising importance of shared decision-making (61) and the increasing call for a patient revolution (66), further tool types have been added to the mix, including decision aids, question prompt lists and option grids (78, 79). Is the image of the clinician bogged down in information being replaced with one of the clinician bogged down in a myriad of knowledge tools (80)? This image is probably not exclusive to the Netherlands, as there appears to be a 'widespread view [...] that work effectiveness is impaired by information overload' (18, 19). Moreover, even though tool types such as CPGs, standards, pathways and decision aids are used in other countries as well (81-87), are all these tools really different in terms of content and purpose (76, 88)? Research into knowledge and decision support tools has been conducted within several countries. Such research, however, seems to focus on one tool type, for example clinical pathways (70, 89, 90), CPGs or patient decision aids (58, 88, 91). Research into clinical pathways yielded an overview of 84 similar tools adorned with different names. Another focus in this research was the use, methodology of development (92) and implementation (42) of these tools. To our knowledge, no overview exists at a national level of current knowledge and decision support tool types used by clinicians or patients. The objective of this review article is to identify the different types of knowledge and decision support tools which are available at a national level to clinicians and patients in the Netherlands and to gain insight in how these tool types are described or defined. We looked at it from a national policy perspective, concentrating on tool types developed by national organisations. For reasons of feasibility, we focused on Dutch national organisations that develop and implement these tools. A scoping review identifies the range and nature of existing knowledge tools by summarising what is there and might reveal if something is missing. The review therefore also serves as a basis for conducting further research and defining relevant research questions related to tools, knowledge use and translation.Chapter 2 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 27DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 27 25-9-2020 00:42:0925-9-2020 00:42:0928 28 Methods General design This study is a descriptive scoping review of knowledge tool types developed by Dutch national healthcare organisations and tools that support clinicians or patients with knowledge transfer and shared decision-making. The general purpose for conducting scoping reviews is to identify and map the available evidence, in this case tool types. Arksey & O'Malley, and Levac et al, also described several reasons why scoping reviews are conducted. We chose this kind of review because we wanted to examine the amount and range of available tool types, and gain insight into the provided definitions (93, 94). Data sources The websites, documents and links to other sources on the websites of purposive sampled Dutch healthcare organisations known to develop and disseminate knowledge tools were used as data sources. Organisations that solely fund or research such tools were excluded. Because of the multitude of organisations in the Netherlands developing and disseminating knowledge tools, the authors selected seventeen of them: three medical specialists associations, two allied healthcare organisations, five guideline agencies, one umbrella organisation for professionals, five government agencies and one umbrella organisation for patients (see appendix A). Inclusion criteria for the tool types Included in this review were those tool types which are being developed and made available by Dutch nationwide non-commercial healthcare organisations; are related to care content; for which an evidence-based approach was followed; which are intended for knowledge transfer and decision support; are publicly accessible and which concern cure and/or palliative care (figure 1). We used the following definition of a tool: a tool distils, synthesizes and interprets the highest quality knowledge and research to serve knowledge translation and support (shared) decision-making (95). Related, secondary tools that are based on these primary tools, with the main purpose to educate and/or implement were, albeit contributing to knowledge translation, excluded. Identification, selection of tools and data extraction A scan of the selected organisations was undertaken to reveal which search terms to use in order to identify knowledge tools (see appendix B). These terms were then processed through two thesauri (9, 96) to find synonyms and related terms. The list of terms was entered into the search engines on the websites of the organisations. If a website did not support searches for compound terms (for example, 'evidence table'), the yield of hits for the separate search terms was checked for their combination. In cases of various spellings for the same term, e.g. 'shared decision-making' and 'shared decision making', both spellings were used. If a website did not provide a search engine, the terms were searched on the webpages by the first author with the help of the web browser search function and by manual inspection. Chapter 2 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 28DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 28 25-9-2020 00:42:0925-9-2020 00:42:0929 An iterative approach was used when searching these websites. The hits were checked for relevant descriptions and information by the fi rst author. The information was copied and pasted into a crude data fi le, including web address and the time and date of the search. When there were more than 100 hits, only the fi rst 100 were checked. In cases where the hits redirected to other websites (see appendix A) these links were followed, as were links to reports and articles ('snowballing' method). When reports or publications were unavailable on the website, the organisation was contacted in order to obtain a copy of the report or article. If it could not provide the document, it was obtained through the National Library of the Netherlands. In the case of unclear or unavailable descriptions, Google was used to fi nd more information on the term in combination with the organisation. If Google yielded no or insuffi cient information, the organisation was contacted by email to ask for the missing information. If no clarifi cation could be provided by email, a phone call or physical appointment was undertaken to retrieve the missing information. Both the emails and the notes of the telephone conversations were added to the crude data fi le. If the email or follow-up was not successful after two attempts, the researchers limited themselves to the available data from the websites. Data analysis Statements describing or defi ning the knowledge tool types formed our primary interest. Each tool type found was entered into a table together with the full or partial descriptions identifi ed per data source. All the tools identifi ed were subsequently scored along the inclusion criteria (see fi gure 1) by the fi rst author. To decide if a tool type had followed an evidence-based approach we checked if it was developed in a transparent and systematic way, and searched and synthesized evidence according to the rules of evidence-based practice (26). Figure 1: Inclusion fl ow chart for the fi nal tool selection The scoring by the fi rst author was verifi ed by the authors TvdW and LK, by systematically scoring every tenth tool listed, with TvdW starting from 5 and LK from 10 (so rows 5, 15, 25, 35, etc. and rows 10, 20, 30, etc.). When scores varied, we discussed these until we reached consensus on the scoring. The fi rst author then entered the fi nal scores for all tools. The tool types preliminarily included were copied into a new crude data table. Information received from additional searches and inquiries with the organisations were added to this table. On the basis of the additional information, we made a decision on fi nal inclusion. The fi nal table was structured by organisation to provide insight into the number of organisations in the Netherlands active in developing and disseminating knowledge tools, and the diff erent names of Chapter 2 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 29DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 29 25-9-2020 00:42:0925-9-2020 00:42:0930 30 the tools assigned. The tool types were described according to the following characteristics, if available, extracted from the data sources: -Definition or description of tool is available on the website; -Target group of knowledge tool: -Patients, healthcare professionals, both, or others such as policy advisors, government and insurers? -If targeted at healthcare professionals, -Publicly accessible? The aim was to characterise the tool as generic or specific - generic means that the tool can be used or reused for different care subjects and is developed by various organisations; specific means that the tool is limited in its options for use or reuse by others or is developed by one organisation only. As this proved difficult to indicate in a table, we decided to reflect on the characteristics of these tools in the running text. Again, the co-authors verified the subset of the data extraction. They each selected at least 15 tools at random and checked the scoring. In case of disagreement, we discussed the extraction until we reached a consensus. The first author then entered the final scores for all tools. Results The search yielded 126 tool types, of which we included 67 in the review. Data sources We started by searching the websites of the 17 selected organisations. During this search, 10 additional organisations were found via snowballing; three of those organisations that met the selection criteria of the purposive sampled organisations were added to the search and their websites were subsequently searched. Identification, selection of tools and data extraction The search started with 48 search terms. During the search, which took place from September 2012 to April 2013, we added six related terms (marked with an asterisk in appendix B). Hits were listed numerically per organisation, together with the source and description if available. This led to a list containing 126 tool types. Hits which appeared to represent a tool were tentatively put on the list. Descriptions of the tools were either limited or not always available on the websites. Additional inquiries with the organisations, data sources and Google search were used to fill the gaps, but sometimes information remained unknown. After applying the inclusion criteria of the flow chart, 74 tool types remained. However, seven of these were considered synonymous and were removed, leaving 67 tool types (figure 2). The inclusion reliability and data extraction verification by the co-authors did not lead to any discrepancies. This lack of information, even after additional searches and inquires meant that it was not always possible to extract the tools' characteristics. Information on characteristics such as authorisation and patient or public involvement were the most difficult to determine.Chapter 2 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 30DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 30 25-9-2020 00:42:0925-9-2020 00:42:0931 Sometimes the organisations only mentioned the name of the tool and off ered little or no description. In several cases, the information was retrieved by looking at documents on the website or in hard-copy papers obtained from the organisation itself. Moreover, not all tools were accessible via the Internet; some were only available to organisation members or upon payment. In this case, we attempted to obtain a demo version which might yield a description of the tool. Most organisations that we contacted were willing to off er additional information and made demos of their tools available free of charge. These demos, however, did not always yield descriptions either. Some organisations did not describe the tool on their website, while others off ered more than one description. On several websites compound terms were mentioned but only the simple term was explained. For instance, the website of the Federation Medical Specialists explains the term 'guideline' but does not explain the term 'multidisciplinary guideline'. What is meant by 'multidisciplinary' is left to the reader: more than two disciplines of medical specialists, other healthcare professionals, or even other parties such as insurers, providers and patients? As mentioned above, the characteristic of public or patient involvement during tool development was diffi cult to determine. This was apparent in 28 descriptions of tool types, of which fi ve mentioned explicitly that there was no patient or public involvement, and for 34 tools this could not be ascertained. These fi gures were almost the same as those for the characteristic 'authorized' or 'legitimatised' by the organisation(s) involved in the development of the tool: 26 tools were authorised, three were not, and for 38 tools this could not be determined. Four tools were deemed limited accessible; these were diffi cult to fi nd online at the time of the review.

'Patient translation of guideline' and 'patient version of guideline' were considered similar terms, just as 'multidisciplinary', 'network' and 'practice guideline' were considered to be similar to the 'plain' 'guideline'. To show the abundance of names given to the tool types and possible differences in data extraction, we transported all included tools to the final table for data extraction (see table 1) describing their characteristics. T arget users and interrelatedness of tools Despite the increased attention for patient engagement in decision-making and tools enabling this, it appeared that most tool types (n=34) were primarily aimed at healthcare professionals; 14 were aimed solely at patients; and 18 at both. One tool type was targeted at a different user group: helping employers deal with employees who have health problems. Six tool types also mentioned other target users, such as governments and healthcare insurers. Flow charts, summaries and patient versions of CPGs are generally regarded as derivatives of guidelines (97). We consider decision aids and CPGs to be linked as well, since patient decision aids are mostly based, or should be based on CPGs (98). The criteria of Option GridTM even required these to be based on clinical practice guidelines (99). However, interpretations differ among organisations and expected links are missing. For instance, the Netherlands Society of Occupational Medicine (NVAB) and the Royal Dutch Society for Physical Therapy do not regard flow charts and guideline summaries as knowledge tools in themselves - to be used Chapter 2 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 34DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 34 25-9-2020 00:42:1025-9-2020 00:42:1035 independently from the guideline - but as an integral part of the guideline. By contrast, the Nurses Association does regard a summary (sheet) of the guideline as a tool that can be used independently. Patient versions of guidelines were mostly viewed as tools to be used independently. With other tools, however, links were expected, as they cover the same subject and are probably based on the same knowledge. For example, CPGs and patient decision aids developed by the Dutch Institute for Healthcare Improvement were not always developed in concordance with each other, as the CPG for a specific subject was updated but the corresponding decision aid was not. Figure 3 provides a rendering of how different tool types in our view could be (inter)connected or related to each other. Figure 3: A rendering of how tool types could be (inter)connected or related to each other Abbreviations figure 3 -QRG: quick reference guide -CPG: clinical practise guideline Discussion The aim of the review was to assess the number of tool types available to clinicians or patients, by identifying the existing national-level tools that support knowledge translation and (shared) decision-making. We included 67 tools published by 20 organisations. So, does the real-life situation correspond to the picture of chaos painted in the introduction, with doctors bogged down in a myriad of tools? Notwithstanding the fact that the review only included tools from a limited number of national organisations that develop and disseminate knowledge tools, we suggest that the answer is yes. There is an abundance of tool types available and the definitions of these tools are mostly vague or incomplete. This made it difficult to assess whether these tools differ in terms of content or purpose. Chapter 2 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 35DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 35 25-9-2020 00:42:1125-9-2020 00:42:1136 36 Moreover, there are even more knowledge tools available than we could include. For example, tool types such as 'process guideline' and 'modular guidelines' were gaining momentum at the time of the review but were excluded. Based on the name, we decided that the tool type 'process guideline' would probably address care processes and not care content. After inquiry, 'modular guidelines' seemed to refer more to the development process of clinical practice guidelines, and it was therefore excluded. Moreover, we also disregarded tools developed at regional and local levels, just as tools in the domain of long-term care. Also excluded were tools developed at an international level (79, 100), some of which were not yet mainstream in the Netherlands at the time of the review, and tools from (more) commercial organisations such as pharmaceutical companies. This means that there are even more tool types available to clinicians and patients than we mentioned in this article, and we doubt if these are all clearly defined. As a number of definitions were incomplete, data extraction was more difficult than we had anticipated. Textbooks (7, 101, 102), which were consulted to determine search terms, seemed more conscientious about the terms they used than the websites. The books mostly contained definitions or descriptions, but these were sometimes in contradiction with the terms found on the websites. One could argue that the gap identified between the textbooks and the websites perhaps mirrors the gap between theory and practice (101). Most tools were primarily aimed at healthcare professionals. This could be due to the leeway of patient involvement in this area and in developing these tools to catch up. There are other users of these tools, such as the Dutch Health and Youth Care Inspectorate and healthcare insurers. These are, however, not considered to be target groups; that is, they are not mentioned in the descriptions of the majority of the tools. This might reflect the opinion of some developers in the Netherlands that these groups use the tools for other purposes then the ones for which they are intended, e.g. contracting healthcare services or enforcement. These are considered inappropriate uses, which leads to friction between these parties (39). In one of the discussions among the authors, the question surfaced whether information on target users should be part of the definition. What is the hallmark of a good definition and what needs to be included in the definition to describe a tool clearly? An interesting question related to the digital age is whether anything is ever lost or forgotten nowadays. Even though tool types and tools become obsolete or their content becomes outdated, they can often still be found on the Internet (or on PCs). This could mean that tools no longer in use are never completely forgotten, clogging up the already bulging pipeline of tool types. Another aspect of the digital age is that the tool and its medium are becoming increasingly interlinked and inseparable; apps on smartphones are a powerful example (103, 104). Tools are nowadays readily available in different forms and on different media. Looking to the (near) future, we see a digital age with an abundance of access possibilities via apps, social media and the internet, with '[u]nlimited information on limited human bandwidth.' (105). One could raise the question whether it is chaos we are looking at, or evolution. Like organisms, tools come into existence and gradually evolve into different 'species'. In time, some become Chapter 2 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 36DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 36 25-9-2020 00:42:1125-9-2020 00:42:1137 extinct, while the ones that fit best survive. Alternatively, one could put it into more economic terms, as the Dutch healthcare system has undergone a shift from government regulated to a market regulated construct. As a result, organisations apply strategies of differentiation and diversification to advance themselves and to try to distinguish their products from those of other organisations (106). The National Health Care Institute recently introduced the 'care tree' tool (107). This is in effect a digital flow chart, but such a name would not attract the attention desired by the institute (108). The DCGP (Dutch College of General Practitioners) already applied this marketing technique a long time ago by calling its guidelines 'standards'. This implies that when their guidelines are developed according to their strict, predetermined criteria, they are entitled to be called 'standards'. Consequently, DCGP Standard could be considered the 'brand name' for their guidelines. As mentioned above, the description of a tool was not always immediately clear. This does not necessarily mean that there is no understanding of the tools within or outside the organisation. For example, the DCPG Standards have already been in use for almost thirty years. The DCPG Standard and its meaning might therefore be considered to be common knowledge in healthcare practice. The tool types of the Dutch Health and Youth Care Inspectorate (IGJ) proved to be an ambiguous case. The Inspectorate mentioned seven tool types on its site but no definitions were provided. In general, the Inspectorate refers to these tool types as 'field norms', as they are preferably developed by the healthcare field. One of the tasks of the Health Care Inspectorate is monitoring; when it detects an inadequacy, it will call upon the relevant healthcare organisations to address this problem, for example by developing a tool. A clear explanation of these tools would therefore have been expected; in failing to provide these, the expectations of the Inspectorate remain unclear. Some parties, including the Health and Youth Care Inspectorate itself, might say that in this manner it grants organisations room to manoeuvre and decide for themselves which tool is appropriate. At the same time, the Inspectorate fosters expectations of the tool in question and its use for monitoring and enforcement, which congruent with the purposes of the healthcare organisations developing the tool, and whether this organisation employs a clear definition of the tool or not. We decided to include the general term 'field norm' as it can refer to all tool types developed and used by healthcare organisations. The example mentioned above underlines the importance of clear and precise definitions of tools. Norma Lang phrased it boldly in 1992: 'If we cannot name it, we cannot control it, practice it, teach it, finance it, or put in into practice' (109-112) . Another reason for this might be that health care is multidisciplinary, although the real meaning of 'multidisciplinary' seems to become apparent and sink in only now. Apart from different kinds of healthcare professionals, patients are added to the healthcare equation, while insurers, government agencies are also (getting) involved (113, 114). Maybe these do not all play a pivotal role in the decision-making process between patient and clinician, but they do use the tools. To better understand each other it is therefore necessary to use and speak the same language (115). As Ubel states in his book 'Critical decisions': 'For any pair of people to communicate effectively, it helps enormously if they share a common language.' (116). At the moment, we Chapter 2 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 37DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 37 25-9-2020 00:42:1125-9-2020 00:42:1138 38 appear to speak a common language regarding knowledge tools in the Netherlands, using terms that sound and look alike. However, because these terms are not always defined explicitly, we do not always attach the same meaning to them or use them in the same way, and we get lost in translation. We have not yet even looked beyond the national borders, even though increasing cooperation between clinicians and patients from different countries (117-119) means additional languages, additional tools and terms, and additional meanings. Some recognise the need to have a common language within and outside the knowledge domain. In 2012, an international study group explored the notion of developing a common terminology for knowledge translation interventions. The rationale for doing this was that 'a wide range of diverse and inconsistent terminology exists in the field of knowledge translation. This limits the conduct of evidence syntheses, impedes communication and collaboration, and undermines knowledge translation.' (120). At an even more fundamental level, organisations have started to work together towards a shared terminology. An international consortium consisting of WHO (ICD10), IHTSDO (SNOMED CT) and LOINC, worrying about the confusion of tongues regarding data collection in (health) care for the use of research and policy development, worked out a framework describing core concepts using concise process descriptions (121). Is the chaos restricted to the Netherlands? A search on foreign websites and PubMed yielded no information or articles on chaos regarding knowledge tools. At the same time, no overviews or frameworks of tool types - which state definitions and possible links between them - were found either for other countries. Glossaries, definitions, A to Z's, jargon busters and taxonomies found (search took place in April 2013) on the websites of e.g. AIWH (Australia), NIH, Informed Medical Decisions Foundation, AHRQ (US), CIHR (Canada), NHS, NICE (UK), \u00c4ZQ (Germany), Cochrane Collaboration, EU and WHO mainly dealt with words and terms related to medicine/ health (adverse event, condition), epidemiology (absolute risk), research (abstract), quality (patient safety terms) and organisation of care domains (advocacy) (122-136). The document that came closest to an explanation of tool types was found on the AHRQ website and concerned a collaboration between Russia and the United States, dating from 1999. It listed under the heading 'Quality standards' Our suspicion that the chaos case was not limited solely to the Netherlands was confirmed when we presented the preliminary results of the review at the Guidelines International Network (GIN) Conference (138) and International Shared Decision Making (ISDM) Conference (139). The conclusion that there are too many tools was endorsed, together with the notion that the links between the tools are often lost. The DECIDE project (Developing and Evaluating Communication strategies to support Informed Decisions and practice based on Evidence) - funded by the European Union - has tried to address these issues, by increasing the accessibility and use of tools such as clinical practice guidelines, linking interconnected tools such as decision aids in a more visible way and updating them (140). The website of the European Union makes it clear that health care is not the only area Chapter 2 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 38DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 38 25-9-2020 00:42:1225-9-2020 00:42:1239 struggling with definition issues: 'It is not possible to use one definition to cover all circumstances. Similarly, the word 'standards' is employed in a variety of ways across Europe [...]. The words also have very different meanings in the local contexts of national higher education systems.' (136) Strengths and limitations Because we made the choice to include tools even though their definition or description was not fully complete - incompleteness was deemed an interesting result by itself - it could mean that somebody else might decide differently on the inclusion or exclusion of the tools that we found. The aim of the review was to show that there were many tool types available in the Netherlands for knowledge transfer and decision-making. Although another person might have chosen different organisations or different tools, we feel that the outcome would have been roughly the same. Because of the national policy perspective, we limited the scoping review to tool types being developed by national agencies. Including locally developed, internationally developed tool types and tool types developed by commercial organisations probably would have generated an even larger range of available tool types, but we would not have been able to look into these tool types in detail as we did in this approach. Conclusions In the Netherlands, but also in other countries, there is a myriad of tool types available to healthcare professionals (and patients). Tools that are developed to facilitate, ensure knowledge translation, and to provide healthcare professionals with support whilst making decisions. But because the tool types are not defined clearly and precise, misunderstanding about their use and purpose can arise. As can miscomprehension between disciplines and domains. We also might be duplicating efforts, and wasting (public) means when developing these tool types. Also, because the dependencies or interconnectedness between some of the tool types is poorly indicated as well. And we still add new ones before we have established that the old ones do not work. By doing so, we seem to be creating, despite our best intentions, a tool overload instead of solving the information overload. Recommendations As existing tool types do not seem to deliver the results for which they are intended or do not live up to the full expectations of their target users, one response is to develop new ones (107, 141). We should ask, however, if this is the right response, or whether we need to take a closer look at the tools already available and how they are being used, need adaptation, as well as paying attention to improving (in providing) the definition of these tool types and their intended use. We have shown that there exists a myriad of tool types, most of which are poorly defined and unclear as well as to their mutual relations. This abundance of tool types might affect their usefulness raising the important question how to deal with all these tools, their different formats and sometimes their contradictory contents. The review underpins what parties have been advocating for a number of years now (88): a trimming down of the number of tool types or terms used and a clear(er) definition of tools. We recommend that parties on either a national or Chapter 2 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 39DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 39 25-9-2020 00:42:1225-9-2020 00:42:1240 40 preferably an international level try, first, to reach agreement on a core set of knowledge tools; second, to reach consensus on the definitions and terms used for these tools; and third, to develop a conceptual framework showing the relations between the tools. This tool issue seems to be an exemplification of the tenet that 'less is more'. However, as we did not systematically invest Dutch clinicians' and/or patients' views on this issue, we would recommend that follow-up research is carried out to find out if Dutch healthcare professionals and patients are aware of the multitude of tool types, how they perceive this availability and how they deal with it. Another paper features our report on a Delphi process intended to reach a consensus on the number of tool types and their definitions at a national level in the Netherlands. This Delphi process (2015) was followed by an invitational meeting with international experts (2016) aiming to develop a framework of related knowledge tools, their purposes and characteristics (142).Chapter 2 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 40DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 40 25-9-2020 00:42:1225-9-2020 00:42:1241 Appendix A - Searched websites # WEBSITE / ORGANISATION (DUTCH) WEBSITE / ORGANISATION (ENGLISH) 1 CBO Dutch Institute for Healthcare Improvement 2 CPZ - Co\u00f6rdinatie Platform Zorgstandaarden Coordination Platform Care Standards 3 FMS - Federatie Medisch Specialisten Federation Medical Specialists 4 Gezondheidsraad Health Council of the Netherlands 5 IKNL - Integrale Kankercentrum Nederland Quality Institute for Oncological Practice 6 IGJ - Inspectie Gezondheidszorg en Jeugd Health and Youth Care Inspectorate 7 8 KNGF - Koninklijk Nederlands Koninklijke Nederlandsche Maatschappij tot bevordering Association 10 NHG - Nederlands Huisartsengenootschap Dutch College of General Practitioners (DCGP) 11 Pati\u00ebntenfederatie Arbeids- van leven Research organisation (developing Preventive Child Health Care guidelines) 15 Trimbos Instituut Netherlands Institute of Mental Health and Addiction 16 V&VN - Verpleging en Verzorgenden Nederland College voor Zorgverzekeringen, CVZ)National Health Care 18* IVM - Instituut voor Verantwoord MedicijngebruikDutch 20* NKP - Association of Insurance Medicine 23 Regieraad Kwaliteit van Zorg Dutch Council for Quality of Health Care 24 RVS - Raad voor Volksgezondheid en SamenlevingCouncil for Health Parent and Patient Organisations on hereditary diseases/Neuromuscular Diseases Association 26 VWS - Ministerie van Volksgezondheid, Welzijn en SportMinistry 27* SGB - Stichting Geneesmiddelenbulletin Geneesmiddelenbulletin Foundation (Dutch drug bulletin) * Websites 18 - 27 (in italics) were found via snowballing and searched as well; only the results of the three websites marked with an asterisk (*) were included, as these were the only ones that met the selection criteria of the originally selected organisations.Chapter 2 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 41DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 41 25-9-2020 00:42:1225-9-2020 00:42:1242 42 Appendix B - Search terms SEARCH TERMS (DUTCH) SEARCH TERMS (ENGLISH) Kennis Knowledge Kennisinstrument Knowledge tool Kennisbevordering Knowledge advancement Kennisontwikkeling Knowledge development Kennisoverdracht Knowledge transfer Kennistransfer Knowledge transfer Kennisverwerving Knowledge acquisition Kennisdeling* Knowledge sharing Kennisverbetering* Knowledge enhancement Beslissing Decision Beslissing(s)ondersteuning Decision support Besluitvorming Decision (-) making Keuzehulp Decision aid Keuzewijzer Decision pointer Beslisboom Decision tree/flow chart Besliskunde Decision theory Decision support Decision support Decision aid Decision aid Keuze Choice Shared decision (-) making Shared decision (-) making Informatie (-) uitwisseling Information exchange Informatiebehoefte Information need Informatiefolder Information brochure Informatie (-) overdracht Information transfer Informatieverstrekking Information provision Informatieverwerving Information acquisition Informatiemateriaal Information material Richtlijn Guideline Protocol Protocol Zorgstandaard Care standard Standaard Standard Kwaliteit(s)standaard Quality standard Professionele standaard Professional standard Norm Norm Zorgmodule/module Care module/module Leidraad Guiding principle Klinisch/zorgpad (patient care way) Clinical /care pathway Aanbevelingen Recommendations Clinical evidence samenvattingen Clinical evidence summaries Samenvatting(skaart) Summary (sheet) Evidence tabel Evidence table Pati\u00ebntenversie Patient version Pati\u00ebntenmateriaal Patient material Pati\u00ebntenbrief Patient letter Pati\u00ebntenparticipatie Patient participation Pati\u00ebntenperspectief perspective Preferenties/preferences Preferences PROM's PROMs Brochure Brochure Pati\u00ebnt/cli\u00ebnt/burger/zorgvrager/ zorgconsument*Patient / client / civilian / care recipient / care consumer Kwaliteitsinstrument/interventie* Quality tool / intervention Taxonomie* Taxonomy Definitie(s)* Definition(s) * These search terms were added during the search as they surfaced repeatedly.Chapter 2 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 42DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd and clarifying de nitions of know- ledge and decision support tools. A RAND-modi ed Delphi consensus studyChapter 3 00:42:1325-9-2020 00:42:1346 46 Abstract Background A review of tools for knowledge translation and decision support yielded an abundance of tool types and confusion over the definitions of these knowledge tools. The aim of this study was to limit the number of tool types, reach consensus on their definitions and clarify their intended use. Methods We used the RAND-modified Delphi approach to select a core set of knowledge tools and to reach agreement on the tools' definitions. The knowledge tool types were scored using a Likert scale in two Delphi rounds on importance; the provided definitions were also scored and commented on by the experts. Results Over 20 experts from parties involved with development of knowledge and decision support tools reduced the number of tool types from 34 to 13. The Delphi participants reached consensus on nine tools as being important for knowledge translation and supporting (shared) decision-making. Furthermore, they reached consensus on the definition of five of the 13 tools. Conclusions/discussion A large group of experts, representatives of Dutch knowledge tool developers, managed to reach consensus on a core set of 13 knowledge tool types for the Netherlands. Implementing the use of this set and limiting the expansion with other tool types remains challenging. Keywords Knowledge (translation) tools; Decision support; Definitions; 00:42:1325-9-2020 00:42:1347 Introduction The amount of knowledge in health care is vast and accumulates fast (14). Clinical practice guidelines (CPG) and patient decision aids (PDA) are common tools being developed to support healthcare professionals and patients in knowledge translation and (shared) decision making (95). These tools can help in staying abreast of the available knowledge and contribute to the improvement of quality health care. Beyond CPGs and PDAs, a scoping review yielded an abundance of types of knowledge tools available to professionals and patients in the Netherlands to support quality improvement. It also became clear that contrasting or incomplete definitions were used to describe these tool types (143). Moreover, these tools are not often used in practice for instance due to unfamiliarity, limited usability, or non-acceptance (42, 43, 141, 144-147). It might be argued whether the sheer number of tool types is helpful or complicates the process of knowledge translation (KT) (148), and quality improvement in health care. Organisations such as Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the Cochrane Collaboration and World Health Organization (WHO) have glossaries or A-to-Z's on their websites, but these mostly explain health terms and do not describe the knowledge tools in detail (122, 123, 129, 130, 132). Existing overviews of tools include similar tool types with different names and without a clear definition or description (70, 88, 149). No attempts seem to have been made to limit the number of tool types and achieve consensus on the definitions on a national level. A comprehensive, commonly accepted set of knowledge tool types and their definitions seems to be lacking in the Netherlands, as we expect is the case elsewhere. Although we focused on the Netherlands in this study, we aimed to link English terms and tool types to the Dutch ones and to contact international research communities active within knowledge translation (120), and connected to the Guideline International Network (G-I-N) and International Shared Decision Making (ISDM) (88). The research and preliminary results were discussed with experts and at two conferences of G-I-N and ISDM (138, 139). We learned that others encountered the same issue in other countries. This led to an invitational meeting with international experts to develop a framework for (patient-directed) knowledge tool types (142). The objectives of this study are: first, to agree at a national level on a core set of knowledge tool types that supports clinicians and patients in knowledge translation, (shared) decision-making and quality improvement; and, second, to agree on the definitions of these tool types. Our ultimate aim is to promote a mutual understanding and use of a limited set of tool types. The Dutch National Health Care Institute, responsible for quality of care against acceptable costs in the Netherlands supported and participated in the study.Chapter 3 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 47DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 47 25-9-2020 00:42:1325-9-2020 00:42:1348 48 Methods General design This study, conducted in 2015/2016, combined a survey with the RAND-modified Delphi method (also known as RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method) (150) to identify a core set of knowledge tools and to reach agreement on the definitions of these tool types. The survey was added ahead of the Delphi to limit the number of tool types to be assessed during the Delphi, as the experts were expected to answer three questions per tool type. The project group thought this would be too time consuming and might jeopardize their participation. A knowledge tool can be defined as a tool to assess and synthesise the highest-quality knowledge and research, aimed at healthcare professionals and/or patients, serving to translate knowledge and support (shared) decision-making (95). The definition of a knowledge tool consists of three parts: a description of the tool, its goal and its target user(s) (151). Participants and project group The participants were purposively sampled for this study. Eligible candidates were identified by the project group using the following characteristics: professional activity in health care, palliative care or long-term care; expertise, either academically or in practice, in developing, implementing or evaluating knowledge tools for professionals, patients, or both; expertise in (shared) decision-making, linguistics or terminology; active in the public, academic or private domain of health care in the Netherlands; and with understanding of the Dutch language. In addition, we aimed for diversity in affiliation, gender and age among the participants. The group of experts was complemented with members of a working group advising the National Health Care Institute on tool development and use. As these members were representatives of the main (health)care organisations in the Netherlands which develop and disseminate knowledge tools, their involvement and contribution was considered essential. The anonymity of participants was ensured at all levels. First, the experts did not know who participated. Furthermore, their responses in the Delphi rounds were submitted under code aliases. The list with code aliases was only known to the administrator of the Delphi platform. By agreeing to participate in the survey and Delphi process, the experts also gave consent to use their comments for publication. The participants were contacted via email by the first author explaining the nature and goal of the study and the consecutive steps of the study. The participants were informed of the outcomes after each round. None of the participants received any remuneration. The project group consisted of the authors and the secretary of the working group of the National Health Care Institute. Identification and selection of tools Starting point was a longlist of knowledge tool types (n=67) yielded by a scoping review of knowledge and decision support tool types (143), separately executed before this study. The scoping review looked at tool types - developed by national, non-commercial, organisations - that support knowledge translation and (shared) decision making and their definitions. The Chapter 3 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 48DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 48 25-9-2020 00:42:1325-9-2020 00:42:1349 project group merged overlapping tool types and excluded tool types that are only developed by one organisation. In addition to excluding tools, the project group decided to split two tool types into two as the project group could not agree whether these tools were actually one or two tool types combined. The National Health Care Institute identifi ed another fi ve tool types to be added to the list. Some of these were excluded in the scoping review, but as these tool types were part of the institute's monitoring responsibility they were added again (indicated with c in table 2 (and table 3)) (152). A few members of the project group considered that some of the tool types in the category 'umbrella tools' could be regarded as actual tools. Because we could not reach agreement on this, we decided to let the study participants decide. Finally, the project group added one emerging tool type (indicated with d in table 2), resulting in a list of 34 tool types. The defi nitions originating from the review were combined with those developed by the institute into an overview to compare the defi nitions of the tool types included by the survey. If the tool type defi nitions in the review diff ered from those developed by the Institute, were unavailable, or lacked any of the three required parts of a defi nition (a description of the tool, its goal and its target user(s)), such information was completed by the project group, preferably using glossaries and internationally available defi nitions (9). Survey and Delphi set-up The project group decided that assessing 34 tool types in a Delphi process by answering three questions per tool type would be too time consuming for the experts and might jeopardize their participation. Therefore, a survey was held ahead of the Delphi to decrease the number of tools to be assessed in the fi rst Delphi round. The participants were only asked to indicate for each tool whether to keep or eliminate it; no criteria were provided by the project group. Defi nitions of the tools were not provided at this stage as we did not want to infl uence them during the in-/exclusion process. At the end of the survey, the participants were given the possibility to add tool types, preferably with a defi nition. Added tool types suggested by at least three participants were added to the list for the Delphi. Tools receiving a positive score ('keep') from more than 50% of the participants remained on the list. Chapter 3 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 49DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 49 25-9-2020 00:42:1425-9-2020 00:42:1450 50 The survey was followed by an online RAND-modified Delphi. This consensus method was chosen with the aim to reach agreement with regard to different opinions, fluctuations in use and number of tools over time, and political involvement as the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare, and Sports was involved (via the National Health Care institute) in the development and monitoring of knowledge tools. The ministry wanted to have some influence regarding the quality of the tools developed, monitor efforts by the parties involved and see to an improved synchronized effort in developing these tools. Defining these tools therefore became of interest to the ministry as well. By using consensus methods, one can determine to which extent the participants agree with the issue posed and to which extent participants agree with each other. Choosing the RAND-modified Delphi also prevented more vocal people to dominate (153). The Delphi process consisted of two rounds. In both rounds, the participants were asked to score the tool types on a Likert scale according to the importance of the tool type (0-8; not important at all - very important) and their agreement with the definition provided (0-8; very much disagree - very much agree). In addition, they had the possibility to suggest amendments to the definitions provided for each tool and to add tools, preferably including a description. In the first round, the participants scored without seeing any scores of the other participants. In the second round, the scores and comments were visible to all participants, who were also able to discuss these with each other. The sequence of the tools was randomly determined for the first Delphi round. The different tool types were printed on paper and a colleague, who was not involved in the study, blindly selected the papers from a non-transparent bag. In the second round, we reversed the sequence of the tools and provided adapted definitions based on the first-round comments. The scoring and comments were analysed by the first author and checked by the project group before these were shared with the participants. Data analysis Consensus on relevance/importance of the tool type and agreement with the definition was defined as: the median of the scores 6 AND 70% of the participants' scores were in the Likert score cluster 6-8. Consensus on irrelevance/unimportance of the tool type and disagreement with its definition was defined as the median of the scores 2 AND 70% of the participants' responses are in the Likert score cluster 0-2. Tool types were discussed if: 30% of the responses were in group 0-2 AND 30% of the responses were in group 6-8. All other scores indicated ambiguity, and results scored by fewer than nine participants were considered invalid (see Appendix A). Concerning the suggestions for the definitions made by the participants, the first author compiled the suggestions, determined whether to adapt the definition, and discussed the findings with the project group. The same approach was followed for added tool types suggested by the participants. To conclude the study, a linguist aided the first author in editing and finalising the definitions of the tools for which the experts had assessed the definitions.Chapter 3 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 50DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 50 25-9-2020 00:42:1425-9-2020 00:42:1451 Results We describe briefly the main results of the survey and Delphi-process before we present the process and the results in more detail. The survey and Delphi achieved a reduction of the number of tool types: from 34 to 13 tool types. For five of these 13 tool types consensus was reached on the definitions, and for nine of the 13 selected tool types there was consensus on the importance of these tools concerning knowledge translation and supporting (shared) decision-making (Table 4). Survey and participants Fifty-seven experts participated in our study (Table 1), 13 (19%) declined or did not respond to the invitation. From the 57 participants, 82% (n=47) responded to the survey, of which 44 (77%) completed the entire survey.

Two additional tools were mentioned by more than three participants: 'Option GridTM' and 'guidance'. After discussing the results, the project group decided to merge the tools 'pharmaco-therapeutic guideline', 'multidisciplinary guideline' and 'clinical practice guideline' into a single tool 'clinical practice guideline'. Furthermore, the project group decided to keep four tool types on the list even though less than 50% of the participants considered them important. We considered two of these kept-on tool types - 'information standard' and 'guideline module' - to be too new and therefore probably too unknown to the participants to be assessed without a defi nition. Regarding the third kept-on tool type 'clinical pathway', we decided that this tool name was better established than 'care pathway' and the project group argued whether the experts would be able to distinguish between these tool types, and if so, how they would distinguish between them. Finally, we considered the fourth kept-on tool type 'viewpoint' of added value to and diff erent from 'clinical practice guideline', and wanted to know whether the experts shared our opinion. The participants of the survey were informed of the results and decisions by the project group. The list after the survey fi nally included 22 tool types to be assessed in the Delphi (Figure 2 and table 4). * From the 18 tool types in the 2nd Delphi round it was suggested that fi ve should be merged. The defi nitions of the to be merged tool types were not assessed again, leaving 13 tool defi nitions.

In the second Delphi round, 20 (35%) experts participated, of whom 17 (30%) completed all questions. Table 3 describes the backgrounds of the experts.

Six additional tools were suggested, but each by one participant only. There was consensus on the importance of nine tools, and on the definition of nine tools; of which six tools overlapped. For one tool - 'quality assessment framework' - the scores differed on its importance. The remaining tools were scored ambiguously, with the divergent Likert scores indicating a lack of consensus on either agreement or disagreement of their importance. Notably, the newly emerging tool 'Option GridTM' was the tool most often scored as 'no opinion': eight times for importance and six times for definition. Most comments of the participants could be categorised into the following issues: can we limit the number of tools; can we merge similar tools; and can we visualise how the tools relate to each other? Looking at the scores and comments, the project group decided to eliminate four tool types, even though there was no consensus on the unimportance of these with f in Appendix B). Taking the definition of a knowledge tool into account, the project group did not consider the first three tools as knowledge tools. 'Information folder' was judged too broad by the experts, as it could cover information of any kind. Moreover, it was felt that there was Chapter 3 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 54DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 54 25-9-2020 00:42:1525-9-2020 leaflet' and 'patient information'. Concerning the definitions, some participants felt it important that the definition also stated which organisation(s) developed or owned (i.e. is responsible for, of maintaining) the tool, which would increase the trustworthiness of the tool. Another frequent comment was to change the wording in such a way that the definition not only covered curative care but also long-term care. Because of the participants' suggestions regarding the similarity of some tools, the second round we asked them whether they agreed or disagreed on merging some of these tool types (marked with an asterisk in Appendix B). In the second round, the scoring option 'no opinion' was removed, as the project group felt that the Likert scores 3-5 (neutral) should cover this option. In the second Delphi round, every question was scored by at least nine participants, making the results valid. Again, there was consensus on the importance of nine tools (see table 4), of which eight were identical to the ones in the first round. More than 85% agreement on importance was reached on five tool types (see table 4): 'summary', A notable score was the 100% consensus on the importance of the tool 'clinical practice guideline' (see Appendix B). In this round, there was consensus on the definitions of five tools (bold in Appendix B and C). The overlap with the first round amounted to four tools, while the overlap regarding the consensus on importance and definitions comprised five tools. There was overall consensus on the merging of the five suggested tools (70-94% agreement (Likert score 6-8) with a median score of 8 for all the tool types). Recently introduced tool types had low levels of consensus on importance (and definition), which could be due to lack of familiarity or that other tool types were considered more important. As was reflected in the consensus scores regarding the definitions, the experts in round one reached agreement on more definitions than they did on the adjusted definitions in round two. The experts were aware of this discrepancy and commented on it in the discussion phase of the Delphi. Except for minor differences in wording, they indicated they preferred the definitions of round one. Furthermore, the main suggestion in the second round was to broaden the scope from health care to include the whole spectrum of care, notably public health. The project group concluded that not all adjustments to the definitions were perceived as improvements, or perhaps participants were being more forward in the second round.Chapter 3 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 55DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 55 25-9-2020 00:42:1525-9-2020 00:42:1556 56 Table 4: Tool types (22) assessed in Delphi, clustered per target group CONSENSUS ON TOOL TYPE IMPORTANCE DEFINITION PATIENTS / NEXT OF KINPatient decision aid merged Option GridTM - - Information folder - - Patient leaflet - merged Patient version (of CPG) - HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS Guideline-like toolsCare module - - Care standard - - Clinical practice guideline (CPG) merged Clinical practice guideline module - 'Helping hand'/guidance - - Normc - - Viewpoint - -Derivatives from CPGCare pathway - - merged Clinical pathway - - Decision tree - merged Flow chart Indicatorc - - Protocol Summary (of CPG) UMBRELLA TERMS AND OTHER TOOLSInformation standardc - - Quality assessment frameworkc - - Quality standard - - NUMBER OF TOOLS22 9 5 Legend table 4 Consensus in Delphi on importance or definition - No consensus nor dissensus on importance or definition c Tool types added by National Health Care Institute d Tools that were merged in Delphi round 2 e This merged tool type was renamed: Patient informationChapter 3 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 56DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 56 25-9-2020 00:42:1525-9-2020 00:42:1557 Discussion Our study aimed to agree at a national level on a core set of knowledge tool types supporting clinicians and patients in knowledge translation and (shared) decision-making and other stakeholders in healthcare quality improvement and policy. We succeeded in reducing the number of tool types from 34 to 13. Furthermore, the experts reached consensus on the importance of nine tool types as being important to for knowledge translation and supporting (shared) decision-making. Additionally, for five tool types, the experts agreed on their definition. We also created awareness among the organisations and experts involved, encouraging them to follow-up actions. More collaboration between organisations and experts is necessary for mutual understanding and sustainability of the set of tool types agreed. Strengths and limitations of the study The Delphi consensus method has a number of limitations. Some issues include: the accuracy of experts' answers; time constraints; the level of detail of the input by experts; and the possible effect of the presented order of the tool types on the scoring. We think that the accuracy of the answers did not affect the outcomes too much because of the number of participants and their diverse backgrounds. The same applies to the level of detail; some experts gave more input than others, but because of the size of the group we feel that the input overall was balanced. The time to respond in the Delphi rounds was limited. As 17 experts of the original 21 also completed the second Delphi round, the effect of the time constraint might be considered as limited. To reduce the effect of the tool order, the order was reversed in the second Delphi round. Although none of the invited insurers participated in the study (they indicated that this exercise should be left to the experts), most health care domains with varying expertise were represented. We think that selection bias is limited, because the number of experts participating in the Delphi was above the required minimum of nine. There were some discrepancies between the narrative comments on tool types, which were described as unimportant but which still scored four (neutral) on the Likert scale. This issue was addressed by the project group during the analysis. Our study is the first study that systematically evaluated the tool types available to support knowledge translation. Other studies focus on defining or assessing the quality of clinical practice guidelines (155-157), developing or validating tools (158-160), or prioritising research agendas (161, 162). Some organisations use A-to-Z's and glossaries but without detailed analysis and comparisons. There are also studies listing the divergent names and terms being used in health care, concluding that this hinders knowledge translation (120, 163). For example, Elwyn et al discern between decision and behaviour support interventions to describe the characteristics of these two categories; however, they do not address the individual tools within these categories (91). Follow-up of the study The Delphi has already had impact in Dutch healthcare policy and management. In June 2015, the National Health Care Institute presented the Delphi results in a meeting of the Chapter 3 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 57DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 57 25-9-2020 00:42:1525-9-2020 00:42:1558 58 aforementioned working group, to attempt to reach consensus on the remaining tools. The group reconvened in June 2016, again discussing the tools and their interrelations. In 2018, the Federation of Medical Specialists, an umbrella organisation of 32 medical specialist societies acknowledged the importance of having a limited set of tool types and agreed on a list with five tool types and their definitions [29]. Furthermore, organisations and agencies in the mental healthcare and nursing have tried to elaborate on our work by aiming to reach agreement on care terminology used by both parties. Finally, the Dutch Federation of Patient Organisations, an umbrella organisation of more than 200 patient organisations, has endorsed the core set and started using its definitions. Conclusions and implications for practice For successful implementation, it is necessary that the parties involved use and stick to the core set of tool types. It requires discipline and resisting the temptation to design new tools, regardless trends in health policy (108). Imbedding clearly defined tools in knowledge translation strategies, combining them with other KT interventions or integrating them in the KT-cycle, might contribute to their implementation as well (147, 164, 165). So far, organisations have made steps in using the core set and reducing the number of tool types to be funded and developed but collaboration could be improved. This is of increasing relevance as healthcare services are becoming more multidisciplinary and patients are getting more involved in policy making. A shared taxonomy at a national level and a clear governance structure with defined tasks and roles of different stakeholders within the healthcare system will help reducing confusion and duplication of efforts. In addition, formal and informal networks nationally and internationally can contribute to raise awareness and understanding. Repeating the Delphi in an international context, for instance within the Guidelines International Network, including more than 100 organisational members in 30 countries across the world, or the International Society for Evidence Based Health Care (EBHC), might be a worthwhile exercise. As language is dynamic, and meanings and use of the tool types might change over time, the tool types and their definitions need to be reviewed periodically. The challenge is to balance between the need to keep definitions over time and to keep up-to-date with new knowledge and research findings.

However, an abundance of these exists. T he tools themselves and their purposes are not always clearly defined; creating challenges for developers and users (professionals, patients). The study's aim was to develop a conceptual framework of patient-directed knowledge tool types. Methods A face-to-face evidence-informed consensus meeting with 15 international experts. After the meeting, the framework went through two rounds of feedback before informal consensus was reached. Results A conceptual framework containing five patient-directed knowledge tool types was developed. The first part of the framework describes the tools' purposes and the second focuses on the tools' core elements. Conclusion The framework provides clarity on which types of patient-directed tool types exist, the purposes they serve, and which core elements they prototypically include. It is a working framework and will require further refinement as the area develops, alongside validation with a broader group of stakeholders. Practice implications The framework assists developers and users to know which type a tool belongs, its purpose and core elements, helping them to develop and use the right tool for the right job. Keywords Framework; knowledge; tools; Sackett et al described evidence-based medicine as integrating \"the best external evidence with individual clinical expertise and patients' choice\", and Charles et al tried in 1997 to define shared (treatment) decision-making (26, 166). Both heralded the more formal recognition of patient engagement. The WHO defines patient engagement as the capacity of patients, families, carers, as well as healthcare providers, to facilitate and support the active involvement of patients in their own care, in order to enhance safety, quality and people-centredness of healthcare service delivery (167). In the past, patient engagement might have been primarily a moral-ethical imperative (168), but this engagement is also associated with numerous beneficial outcomes such as improved knowledge, satisfaction and self-management and reduced decisional conflict (169-173). Moreover, involving the patient is important because physicians may recommend treatments that they would not have chosen themselves (174), and physicians are mostly not adept at predicting what their patients want (32, 63). These and other reasons to engage patients in decisions about care have led to the development of a range of knowledge tools (175, 176). Overall, there exists an abundance of tool types to engage patients in decision-making and contribute to patient-centred care. Examples of knowledge tools are clinical practice guidelines (CPG), protocols, patient decision aids (PDAs) and patient education materials (143, 177- 179). Knowledge tools distil and synthesize the highest quality knowledge and research (95). Patient-directed knowledge tools are aimed directly at the patient (family members and carers), with the goal to engage patients in dialogue or deliberation during a clinical encounter, or to support and/or improve patient decision-making which may or may not take place during a clinical encounter (175). The ultimate goal is to contribute to safer and higher quality healthcare. However, these types of tools are frequently ill defined (70, 88, 143, 178). Moreover, lack of clarity on development, content, and purpose has likely contributed to poor uptake (8, 47, 145, 180). Several streams of work have contributed to the development of this area. These include development of specific quality criteria for certain tools (such as PDAs, leading to IPDAS, the International Patient Decision Aid Standards) (181-184) as well as frameworks and taxonomies on patient involvement. The purpose of IPDAS is to enhance the quality and effectiveness of PDAs by establishing a shared evidence-informed framework (59, 60, 185). IPDAS does not consider other patient-directed knowledge tools. Several frameworks related to decision support tools have been developed (186). O'Connor et al developed a decision support framework to develop a specific PDA, concentrating on determinants of decisions leading to the Ottawa Decision Support Framework (187, 188). Another example is a taxonomy of outcomes developed by the Cochrane Consumers & Communication Group (CCCG) which can be used by researchers and others to conceptually map the range of outcomes, at different levels of health care, that might be relevant when assessing different forms of communication (such as shared decision making) (189). Chapter 4 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 67DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 67 25-9-2020 00:42:1725-9-2020 00:42:1768 68 Existing frameworks tend to focus on PDAs, and the CCCG taxonomy has a far broader scope than just patient-directed knowledge tools. The aim of our study was therefore, building on existing work, to develop a conceptual framework of patient-directed knowledge tools (190). Our objective was to create a framework that would identify existing patient-directed tool types, allow organisation of these types of tools by their purpose(s) and describe their core elements. The framework is intended primarily for tool developers, and possibly also for those who commission the development of tools, healthcare professionals and policy makers. It should help developers to identify where there is a gap or need for a tool to be developed, and how such a tool may best make information, knowledge and decision support available to patients (144). Methods We used a two-day consensus meeting with international experts. We are not aware of standards for reporting a consensus-based meeting. Instead, we followed the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR) as closely as possible, when writing the manuscript (191). To arrive at a conceptual framework of patient-directed knowledge tool types to engage patients and support patient decision-making within a short time frame, the initiators (TVDW, DD) and chair (JG) decided that a two-day, face-to-face meeting with experts was the most optimal design. We followed a consensus-based process based on a written meeting protocol (see annex A) (192-194). The meeting was audio-recorded, DD took minutes. JG and TVDW made field notes. The meeting took place in February 2016, in Leiden, the Netherlands. The participants were purposefully sampled from the Guideline International Network (GIN), International Shared Decision Making network (ISDM) and the professional networks of the initiators. The participants worked in different domains of knowledge (transfer), implementation and decision support, e.g. as tool developers, implementers or implementation researchers, decision-making researchers, or practitioners. The aim was to have representation from a range of countries, individuals with various professional backgrounds, and patients (see Annex B). There were two groups of participants; those who participated face-to-face in the group meeting and those who joined remotely for the conference call with the large group, or via e-mail. During the preparatory phase the participants received a list with relevant literature (see Annex C). This list included participants' key articles - suggested by TVDW - and its aim was to achieve a common ground between the participants. They also received a list with possible knowledge tool types to be discussed (see annex D). The list was the result of a scoping review undertaken by initiator DD. The meeting protocol was also shared with the participants in this phase (see Annex A) (195). The experts were asked to add missing literature, review the proposed tools and comment on the protocol. If the experts had queries on the provided tools, DD and TVDW provided information to clarify these issues, copying all participants. The meeting consisted of nine steps (see Table 1). In step 1, the face-to-face participant Chapter 4 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 68DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 68 25-9-2020 00:42:1725-9-2020 00:42:1769 group discussed and came to agreement on the scope of the meeting, and the intended final product(s). In step 2, they discussed the list with tool types (Annex D) to ensure that all participants present in the face-to-face meeting were familiar with the tools and their definitions, and, if not, described the tool, and verified that the list was complete. After agreeing on the scope and the tool list, the participants broke up into two groups to sort the tools: which ones to be included in the framework and which ones not, using the definition of the patient-directed knowledge tool (step 3). The two groups presented and discussed each other's findings, and agreed on a list of preliminary tools to be included. Based on this list, the two groups independently identified purposes of the tools, taking the discussed and agreed upon definitions from step 2 into account (step 4). The outcomes of both groups were presented and discussed. This resulted in a first draft of the framework stating the preliminary included tools and their purposes. In step 5, the participants were split up in the two same groups, and were asked - using their research and practice knowledge - to identify core elements of the included tools. Once more, the findings of both groups were presented, discussed, and categorised leading to the second draft of the framework stating tool types, purposes and core elements. Dividing the participants into two groups facilitated involving all participants, and avoiding any individual dominating the group. When there was disagreement the participants discussed the issue until consensus was reached. The next step involved compiling the discussions and findings during a longer break and sent via email - together with the second draft of the framework - to participants taking part via a telephone conference at the end of day 1. The first day's discussions and findings were presented by DD to the participants calling in, and the other participants in the room. The former participants were given the opportunity to ask clarifying questions, and propose/suggest additional tools, purposes, and core elements (step 6). The draft framework was adapted with the input of the remote participants. A summary of the discussions and findings, together with the latest draft framework, were sent via email to participants SH and RR in Australia who could not participate in the teleconference. They would add their knowledge and input during the night (step 7), so that it could be discussed during day 2 of the meeting. Day 2 was dedicated to fine-tuning the draft framework. Therefore, in step 8 the chair (JG) reviewed the possible tools and purposes with the participants to ensure that these were correct and complete, and if all agreed, confirming the purpose(s) for each tool. This exercise was repeated for the core elements (step 9). These steps resulted in the final draft of the framework as developed during the meeting.

Participants in face-to-face meeting - FINAL DRAFT OF THE FRAMEWORK AS DEVELOPED DURING THE MEETING TVDW and DD finalized the draft framework based on the minutes, field notes and recorded data. This also entailed comparing the draft framework with existing frameworks and taxonomies. The comparison was done for two reasons: first, to compare language and terminology used, and second, to establish where the frameworks differed or were alike. The draft framework was distributed in the form of a scientific manuscript to the participants for final feedback. It took one face-to-face session between DD and JG and two rounds by email with all co-authors before consensus was reached on the draft framework. All participants completed a declaration of interests. The initiators and chair proposed how to deal with the declared interests. This was discussed and decided upon at the start of the meeting. The plenary parts of the meeting were audio-recorded and DD took minutes during both days. Furthermore, DD and TVDW compared the minutes and field notes, and adjusted the former if needed. The adjusted minutes - checked against the recorded data - were shared afterwards with the participants for comments. Results The actual meeting was not as linear as described in the meeting protocol and methods section. It turned out to be an iterative process where discussions on tools and purposes lead to core elements and vice versa, but also prompting new or dismissed tool types to be (re-) included. Meeting participants included the moderator (TVDW), secretary (DD), and 15 experts; nine participants attended in person (JG (chair), TA, GE, SF, LK, NS, DS, AS, ST), and four (MA, AG, FL, PV) additionally took part in the teleconference. Two participants (SH, RR) took part via Chapter 4 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 70DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 70 25-9-2020 00:42:1725-9-2020 00:42:1771 email (see annex B). All participants took part in the iterative discussions by email afterwards to finalise the manuscript with the draft framework. Step 1 was to select the tool types to be used when building the framework. Inclusion criteria were: -Main target group are patients (family, care givers); -Content driven instead of process oriented; -Tool type globally known and used; -Fits within the definition of the patient-directed knowledge tool. Based on the outcomes of the subgroups and decisions on these with all participants, we excluded seven tool types (not aimed directly at the patient) from the original list of 11 and added one tool perceived to be aimed at the patient directly but not on the list provided (see Table 2). While discussing the selection with the whole group, we decided to split PDAs into an encounter patient decision aid (ePDA) and an 'independent' PDA, leading to six tools. This distinction is important because the patients will use the former while talking with a healthcare professional and the latter independently, pre- or post-encounter. Tools such as action plans and decision guides were excluded because they concentrate on 'how' (process), and less on 'what' (knowledge). Decision coaching tools were deemed out of scope as well because these are aimed at the patient's coach, rather than primarily at the patient. During the telephone conference two tool types - question prompt list and decision box - were added because they support involving the patient in the care process, leading to a total of eight tools (see Table 2 and Annexes F and D). Table 2: overview of preliminary included and excluded tool types during face-to-face meeting and teleconference # TOOL TYPE INCLUDED, EXCLUDED AND REMARKS 1 Decision tree Preliminary included from list during face-to-face meeting 2 Summary of clinical practice guideline Preliminary included from list during face-to-face meeting Patient decision aid (PDA), split into:Preliminary included from list during face-to-face meeting 3 - Encounter patient decision aid (ePDA) 4 - Independent patient decision aid (PDA) 5 Patient information Preliminary included during face-to-face meeting 6 Care map Added during face-to-face meeting and preliminary included 7 Decision box Added during teleconference and preliminary included 8 Question prompt list Added during teleconference and preliminary included Action plan Added during face-to-face meeting, excluded Decision guide Added during face-to-face meeting, excluded Care pathway Excluded from list Quality standard Excluded from list Care standard Excluded from list Care module Excluded from list Clinical practice guideline Excluded from listChapter 4 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 71DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 71 25-9-2020 00:42:1725-9-2020 00:42:1772 72 Protocol Excluded from list Viewpoint Excluded from list From the preliminarily included tools, we deduced and described the possible purpose(s) of the tools. The purpose to inform patients was combined with 'to educate patients', because the emphasis was to make patients knowledgeable. Another reason to extend the purpose was that informing and educating are often used interchangeably. We made a distinction between the purpose supporting decision-making, and that of engaging in shared decision-making. Even though tools can support decision-making by patient and professional, this does not necessarily mean that the tool also promotes shared decision-making. In the end, the listed possible purposes were aggregated into four purposes (see possible purposes, alleviating fear(s), and decreasing decisional conflict were mentioned as well. The participants concluded they were outcomes, and were therefore not listed as a purpose. Communication was not included as a purpose as well. To engage patients, or exchange knowledge/information with a patient, as a healthcare professional, you need to communicate (verbally and non-verbally) with the patient. It is an overarching means, not a purpose in itself. The next step was to identify core elements of the included patient-directed knowledge tool types. The participants compared the tool types, identified recurring elements within tool types and between tools. Furthermore, based on existing frameworks and taxonomies they determined which elements should be included in a tool type (prototypical), even though existing examples of those tool types may not include these elements. Mentioned elements were for example, (link to) evidence, background on condition, care or treatment options/ alternatives, burden (and evidence thereof), relative importance of outcomes as different patients may weigh importance of outcomes differently (196). Also, possible effects of the tools, such as improving the knowledge of the patient, improving patient's expectations of the treatment, impact on their health and quality of life, improving patient-provider communication, and changes in decision-making behaviour) were discussed as possible purposes. Whilst discussing the elements, explicit mentioning of harms and benefits of treatment/care in the tools was stressed by the participants. Harms were especially emphasised as these are often not mentioned or mentioned less often than benefits (69, 197, 198). At the end, the core elements were put into preliminary categories. When discussing the framework, the purposes, and core elements of the tool types, several issues surfaced. First, at the beginning of the meeting, one participant stated that the patient-directed knowledge tools are preferably based on trustworthy clinical practice guidelines. However, there appears to be a pivotal point between PDAs and CPGs: the element 'recommendation'. A CPG centres on recommendations, meaning that the healthcare Chapter 4 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 72DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 72 25-9-2020 00:42:1725-9-2020 00:42:1773 professional needs to 'translate' it together with the patient to the patient characteristics and preferences (199), whereas decision aids aim to acquaint patients with information about choices and available options, including watchful monitoring. Of late, clinical practice guidelines (recommendations) are created or re-written to include these elements as well, but it is not a common practice yet (180, 200, 201). As one of the participants involved in the meeting noted: \"Looking through a future lens and decision making view: [there will be] a set of guidelines that don't [provide room for contemplation], and 'innovator' guidelines that do list options.\" [quote on reconciling clinical practical guidelines and shared decision-making] (202) Furthermore, some participants argued using other sources than CPGs as a basis for patient- directed knowledge tools, such as evidence summaries or systematic reviews, and questioned how to include qualitative data in the evidence base (203). We also discussed whether the framework should be discretionary or prototypical. Discretionary meaning that the core elements mentioned in the framework are optional; and prototypical indicating that we should aim to include the core elements listed in the framework in patient-directed knowledge tools. For example, current tools mostly disregard core elements such as harms and the need to elicit patient's values (204). Often only one option is stated, instead of giving a complete overview of options, including watchful waiting when relevant (69). We decided that it would be a descriptive and prototypical framework. This decision resulted in one participant to say: \"We are wasting time on patient education material without options; we need to be bold.\" [quote on importance of a prototypical framework] Finalizing the draft framework entailed checking and rewriting the wording used in the framework, and reorganizing the core element categories (171, 205-207). The category 'outcomes', which refers to the effect(s) of the tools, was not included in the framework. Possible effects proposed and discussed during the meeting were: improved knowledge acquisition by the patient, more realistic or informed expectations, decreased decision burden/ stress or less regret. As most of these outcomes have not been confirmed by research (yet), we felt it premature to include this category in the framework (208). The draft framework at the end of the meeting contained eight tools (see table 2), of which two - 'care map' and 'decision box' - were conditionally included as we were not entirely sure if they were patient-directed knowledge tools. The framework in the article contains five tool types, because when looking further into the tools 'question prompt list' and 'decision box', we decided that these tools belong to the tool type 'encounter PDAs, and they were therefore removed from the framework as separate tool types. The tool type 'care map' was left out as well, as they are also called 'care pathways' (70, 143, 178), and we excluded the latter at the beginning of the meeting. It was also suggested in the feedback rounds via email to leave out the tool 'decision tree'. Due to renewed attention to this tool type - e.g. digitalising CPGs into decision trees to enhance use by healthcare professionals and patients (107, 209, 210), and because the tool was not included conditionally, it is still part of the draft framework. The final draft of the framework contains five patient-directed tool types, and consists of two Chapter 4 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 73DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 73 25-9-2020 00:42:1725-9-2020 00:42:1774 74 parts: one stating the four purposes of the tools (see Table 3) and the other the core elements (see Table 3).

There already exist other related frameworks; however, these tend to focus on patient decision aids. At the other end of the spectrum, the CCCG taxonomy takes a far broader view, incorporating all interventions for communication without a specific focus on knowledge tools, and without delineating the core elements of the interventions (59, 60, 205, 211). Conclusions As there exists an abundance of different patient-directed knowledge tools, with different names and mostly unclear definitions, our working framework can help tool developers, people who commission the development of these tools, policy makers, patients and healthcare professionals to discern between the different tools, and to identify to which tool type it belongs, which purposes it serves and which core elements it should contain. Possibly, when there is more clarity on development, content and purpose of the tool, it may lead to a better understanding of the roles of, and uptake of, the tool. We feel that the field of tools development and implementation might profit from initiatives such as this one; it might provide the sought for direction. Regarding the discussion whether to use only CPGs as basis for patient-directed knowledge tools, such as ePDAs, the group discussed the benefits of harmonizing evidence summaries across these tools, also within the context of updating content. Such CPGs and accompanying PDAs have been developed, for example within the MAGIC-project, providing proof of concept for this approach (144, 165, 201). New (types of) tools will emerge. We can use these to test our working framework by assessing if the new tool fits within the current types, whether it requires adding a new tool type, additional purposes or core elements to the framework, or if it is a different type of tool not belonging within the framework. Next steps are to review the framework thoroughly with a broader group of stakeholders, including patients and other users. Working with the framework will demonstrate if it is helpful and complete regarding tool types, purposes, and core elements. For example, it may be helpful to discuss whether or not merging the last two purposes ('support SDM' and 'engage in shared decision-making') which would be a useful revision to the framework. A first cautious check of the framework took place at the International Shared Decision Making (ISDM) Conference, Lyon, in 2017 (212), meeting general agreement and receiving no major comments with respect to content. The framework, a work in progress, could be further enhanced by identifying which effect outcomes of the tools are supported by evidence, and describing the core elements in more detail. Additionally, it is important to consider the implementation and use of these tools, for instance by exploring what skills or support patients need to be able to use them (213).

We tried to counteract this by having a group consisting of participants with different expertise and from various backgrounds, and by providing descriptions of the discussed tools before the meeting. Also, the group was limited in its size. Therefore, the framework was not presented as finished but as a draft framework. Another risk of the group composition and size could be that it obscured tools as not being within scope. There were no patient representatives present during the face-to-face meeting; however, two participants (SH and RR) with extensive experience in health consumer participation and patient-centred care commented and added to the work of the group at the end of day 1. Having (most of) the participants together for a prolonged time in one room, contributed to enhanced participation, open discussions and the liberty to ask each other questions, making it possible to respond to non-verbal communication, and leading to a first draft of the conceptual framework. Implications for practice Our working framework on different types of patient-directed knowledge tools is aimed at developers, and possibly at those who commission the development of tools, healthcare professionals and policy makers, and hopefully adds to clarity on the different knowledge tools by stating the purpose(s) they serve and which core elements they should include. The ambition is that tool types are no longer developed without a clear definition and use. This framework will make it easier for developers to identify when to develop which patient-directed knowledge tool and what core elements to include, and to help patients and professionals to understand when to use which tool type.

By doing so, this framework would help tool developers which tool needs to be developed in which case. Outcome More specific; it is what you have when you walk out of the door of the meeting, the desired resultA framework to be presented to the knowledge and decision support tools community of developers, and, implementers, possibly even users, to test whether it is usable and suitable. A framework that can be adjusted to the national situation. A plan how to ensure that stakeholders worldwide are informed about the framework. Why The rationale for achieving the meeting objective(s) and each individual's \"what's in it for me\"To meet a heart-felt need by developers, implementers and users of knowledge and decision support tools to clarify the different types of tools and how they are mutually related, so that developers can develop the right tool for the right job. To contribute to the different domains of research of the participants, and unifying terminology in and across domains.

This need for appraising and including knowledge from a wide variety of sources in guideline development is well recognised (47, 214, 215). Although evidence on statistical association - usually from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) - is commonly thought to be the dominant type of knowledge appraised and included, guideline developers frequently use a range of other types of knowledge including the views and experiences of those using and providing health services, understanding of how interventions work (e.g. from logic models or realist evaluations), and other information, such as aetiology and the context of care (see Text box 1). Text box 1: Types of knowledge TYPES OF KNOWLEDGE Defining knowledge is challenging as many ideas and theories about what knowledge entails exist. In this paper, we regard other types of knowledge as any knowledge that would not be considered a systematic review or RCT. This would include, but not be limited to, a broad range of explicit understandings of knowledge such as knowledge from outbreak investigations, laboratory research, mathematical modelling, qualitative research, quality improvement processes and clinical audits but also tacit knowledge, practical knowledge and heuristics. These different types of knowledge are used and needed in many situations, for example, when evidence from RCTs is not available, impossible to obtain, contradictory or inappropriate. They can also be used in conjunction with knowledge from RCTs to provide context, to assess relevance and to understand bias. Furthermore, explicit (written or spoken) knowledge and the more intricate forms of knowledge like experiential and contextual knowledge can help guideline makers to take an approach consistent with the intentions of early evidence-based medicine (EBM) proponents: namely, that best evidence is not restricted to evidence from RCTs and meta-analyses alone (26). However, how to properly appraise (judge) and include (integrate) different kinds of knowledge remains unclear. Agreed methods are not yet available or are in the early stages of development and the need for and use of different kinds of knowledge is not always explicitly acknowledged, which affects the use of guidelines in practice (8, 216-218). International and cultural differences in guideline production practices may further impede developments in appraising and including a broader range of types of knowledge (see Text box 2). DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 87DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 87 25-9-2020 00:42:2025-9-2020 00:42:2088 88 Text box 2: International and cultural differences in guideline production INTERNATIONAL AND CULTURAL DIFFERENCES IN GUIDELINE PRODUCTION Guideline development methods have been developed by international networks and presented as universally applicable. But there may be differences in what methods are most appropriate for different contexts. In the workshops and conference sessions organised by the AID Knowledge Working Group, guideline developers from Europe, Latin America and Australia have generally welcomed efforts to include a wider range of types of knowledge in guidelines. USA- based guideline developers have been more critical, especially voicing the idea that any guidance not based on the highest level of evidence derived from RCTs should not be called a guideline. Such different assessments of what knowledge can/should be included in guidelines may have to do with the context in which guidelines are developed, including factors such as how the healthcare system is organised, who develops a guideline, litigation, what additional risks for conflict of interest this implies, and therefore whether guideline methods are more rigid. Approaches towards guideline appraisal and inclusion need to suit the context in which they are used. In this paper, we discuss four specific aspects of guideline development to highlight the main challenges identified by the GIN AID Knowledge Working Group through discussions and workshops with guideline developers and users (see Text box 3): -The purpose of guideline development; -The problem of induction; -The dominance of frequency based reasoning; -The challenge of integrating different sources of knowledge. In order to do this, we refer to some philosophical concepts around knowledge creation. Text box 3: About GIN AID and the development of this paper ABOUT GIN AID AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PAPER GIN AID is a working group of the Guidelines International Network (GIN). The AID Knowledge Working Group tries to contribute to bridging the gap in methods for Appraising and Including Different (AID) Knowledge. To support this ongoing challenge, the GIN AID Knowledge Working Group aims to: - Identify methods and promising initiatives for appraising and including a range of knowledge sources in guidelines; - Facilitate sharing experiences with such methods and their application in practice through workshops at GIN conferences and elsewhere; - Identify areas / questions for methodological development;Chapter 5 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 88DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 88 25-9-2020 00:42:2025-9-2020 00:42:2089 - Work towards reporting standards for knowledge appraisal and inclusion; and - Develop a guide for appraising and including different knowledge. For this paper, members of the GIN AID Knowledge Working Group met several times to discuss the issues of using different knowledge and reasoning in guideline development, based on examples from their own experience and from published literature. After several rounds of revision, the work was presented in a workshop at GIN 2016 Conference in Philadelphia. Input of workshop attendees was compiled, reviewed and included in the final draft of this position paper. For more information please visit: http://www.g-i-n.net/working- groups/aid-knowledge The purpose of guideline development The efforts of the pioneers of the EBM movement were primarily in response to the discovery of the variation problem in population studies. Reducing variation of the care provided at a population level was considered to be an important way to achieve improved quality for individual patients (217). Hence, epidemiology, the science of studying populations, gained prominence in guidelines, the aims of which are to support decisions for individual patients. Classic epidemiology became clinical epidemiology when introduced to the bedside and the dominance of RCTs as the gold standard for intervention studies to assess causal relation between interventions and effect followed in this construct of epidemiology as used in EBM. The underlying - yet little explored - assumption is that guidelines based on population studies provide the best advice to inform clinical decisions for individual patients or situations. However, reducing variation is not the only reason for developing guidelines; they are developed for several reasons, of which the most important one is to improve the quality of care. In order to meet the range of needs, guidelines may need different approaches, such as summarising large quantities of knowledge for practising healthcare professionals, serving as an intermediate product for other tools or applications (such as clinical decision support software) or providing implementation guidance. Although not primarily developed for this purpose, guidelines can also serve as tools to legally shield both patients and professionals, to help governments and health insurers allocate scarce resources and to act as governance frameworks for practitioners and governments. There is also the role of guideline development as a discipline in itself; along with its associated practices and institutions, it provides employment and intellectual interest for many. There has been surprisingly little research into the purposes of guideline development. One mixed-method study found the purposes of guidelines were: defining norms, summarising evidence, formalising current consensus and/or describing current practices in a handbook-type format (8). Making the purposes of guidelines more explicit may help determine how different types of knowledge could and should be used. For instance, if the aim is to describe current good Chapter 5 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 89DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 89 25-9-2020 00:42:2025-9-2020 00:42:2090 90 practice (e.g. how services are organised to deliver care), this may be better achieved by drawing on qualitative or mixed-method evaluative research rather than RCTs. If the aim is to assess the effectiveness of a specific treatment or approach, evidence from RCTs or high-quality prospective cohort studies would usually be the primary source of knowledge, with qualitative or mixed-method studies serving to help understand the local context of implementation. It is important to note, however, that for most guideline developers, the primary purpose remains that of supporting decision making in the clinical encounter. This leads us to the next fundamental aspect of guideline development. The problem of induction How do different types of knowledge in guidelines development help to make clinical decisions? Some basic concepts from the philosophy of science may help to understand the problem. Inference, the problem of induction and evasions In logic, to infer means to conclude from evidence using reasoning (218). In everyday healthcare practice, care professionals and patients reason to reach conclusions about what has happened, to make predictions about what will happen and to decide what to do next. Because of uncertainty in medicine, we usually deal with a specific type of inference, called induction , where the conclusions of our reasoning are not always right even when based on true premises. In philosophy, there is a concern whether this is actually possible, called the problem of induction (218), as introduced by Hume in 1739 (219). At its simplest, this means we cannot predict the future with certainty. Although this seems reasonable, we are in fact able to predict the future quite accurately on many occasions in clinical practice. How is this possible? Philosopher of science Ian Hacking (218) argues that we never solve the problem of induc tion, but only evade it by applying different kinds of reasoning to reduce uncertainty and increase our chance of reaching the best possible outcome. The dominance of frequency-based reasoning The evasion most dominantly used in guideline development is frequency-type reasoning in the form of systematic reviews, RCTs and observational studies (8). This evades the problem of induction by recognising that 'although we can't predict the future for the individual case, we can be \"usually\" right (e.g. 95% of the time)' (218) as long as events or cases are frequent enough. Frequency-based reasoning relies on basic assumptions that have some drawbacks. First, this line of reasoning assumes that reality is dice like and that we - e.g. scientists, guideline developers and healthcare professionals - are rolling the same dice (see Text box 4). Frequency-type reasoning presupposes adequate framing and defining of what is similar and what is not, which is always based on judgement and choice.Chapter 5 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 90DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 90 25-9-2020 00:42:2025-9-2020 00:42:2091 Text box 4: Frequency based induction: rolling dice (paraphrased from Hacking 2001) FREQUENCY BASED INDUCTION: ROLLING DICE The central reasoning in RCTs can be summarised simply as assuming that everything in the world (such as people, relations) behave like dice. That is, if dice roll perfectly, they are fair. If they are unfair - where one side is heavier than the others - they are biased. We're aware of many types of bias a priori in real life situations: for example, known causes, confounders and differences between groups. An RCT of patients with therapy A versus patients with therapy B is like trying to make two similar dice as fair as possible, rolling them many times, and comparing the results of the rolls to show their tendency. The assumption is that by rolling two fair dice, one would expect to see similar results in the end. If this does not happen then the reverse must be true; one of the dice is unfair or biased; one of the faces is heavier than the other. In that case, one of the therapies was better at causing the outcome. We don't know why (rolling dice doesn't give us an explanatory mechanism), but we conclude that it just did, because we found an a priori 'unknown' bias. It is important to note that frequency-type reasoning doesn't work for single case scenarios. A patient can get a first hip replacement only once, not a hundred times. It goes well or it goes wrong. There is no frequency about it. It's like throwing a dice once: you're never sure what will happen. You either throw a six or you don't. Second, frequency-based reasoning aims to find simple causal correlations, independent of context. The question is whether these simple correlations hold true in real life. Different understandings of causality exist that could help us address this drawback (220). For instance, a network of complex causal relationships may be more realistic. This drawback is described as the efficacy paradox, where the different interference from non-specific effects (different from those controlled for between groups in a trial), measurement artefacts (that mimicked therapeutic effects in the trial) and regression patterns (such as the self-limiting nature of a disease) in real life can outweigh the specific effect found in a trial. This paradox may become especially apparent when inferring in the context of multimorbidity (221). Finally, and most importantly, although frequency-based reasoning works well for frequent events (large groups, many data points and long periods of time), such reasoning faces fundamental limitations when inferring in the single-case scenario: a single patient, a rare disease, a system intervention and a one-off event. This can be particularly challenging when recommendations based on frequency-type evidence alone are deployed to help decision making for individual patients or unique situations, such as a public health response to a disease outbreak (47). Given these drawbacks, it is worth noting that other types of reasoning to evade the epistemological problem of induction exist. In table 1, several alternative ways of reasoning are listed. They are mainly used in areas where frequency-based reasoning is particularly problematic, for instance in guidelines focusing on complex interventions, public and occupational health, rehabilitation, and social care and Chapter 5 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 91DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 91 25-9-2020 00:42:2025-9-2020 00:42:2092 92 welfare (221-223). These different types of reasoning try to help make valid inferences for the single-case scenario, when there is no frequency of events. Many of these are already recognised and stated by Bradford-Hill (224) in his criteria for causation, but some are newer, such as Annemarie Mol's logic of care (225), where a practitioner will try something, wait and see and let unfolding events guide the next step. Using this type of reasoning, the problem of induction is solved through 'tinkering', making incremental changes to improve a situation. Guidelines can and do support these kinds of evasions by including different types of knowledge. For instance, providing laboratory information about aetiology helps to make an inference based on mechanistic reasoning (226). A description of cases of harm can offer an inference based on the precautionary principle (227). Rethinking how inferences are made in practice may shift the dominance of frequency-based reasoning and its reliance on a restrictive type of knowledge to a broader spectrum of knowledge being used to support different reasoning approaches. The need for using different type of knowledge is shown by a large Dutch analysis showing that knowledge from RCTs far outweighed other knowledge types used, irrespective of the question at hand, thus ignoring important and relevant knowledge from other sources (8, 216). The challenge of integration Making a recommendation for a specific healthcare problem in a specific healthcare system requires the assessment of knowledge not just on its own merits, but importantly its integration with other knowledge. Indeed, EBM is defined as integrating the best evidence with clinical expertise and patient preference (26). However, in the context of medicine, and even more so in that of guideline production, integration of different types of knowledge remains underexplored and undertheorized. Some areas of evidence synthesis have addressed integration. For example, statistical techniques such as meta-analysis can be used to combine data from different studies, and another range of techniques can be used to synthesise qualitative data. In guideline development, most of the activities and tools to support high-quality evidence synthesis such as risk of bias assessment and quality assessment (such as GRADE) tend to focus primarily on frequency-based reasoning and knowledge. For the assessment of quality of qualitative evidence, there are limited but relevant initiatives for guideline development in progress, for example, the recently published Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation - Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research (GRADE-CERQual) (228) guidance. However, many of these efforts try to achieve integration by synthesizing studies that share the same questions and design (e.g. a set of qualitative or, more narrowly, ethnographic studies) (229), at times appraising (228) all such knowledge again in frequentist terms, like with some qualitative evidence synthesis methods (230) that \"emphasize frequencies of the qualitative data they present ... undermin[ing] the uniqueness of the qualitative knowledge they proclaim by focusing on frequency and the general patterns\" (231). The main issue is that these tools, activities and initiatives aim to integrate similar knowledge, such as data from the same study designs, the same populations or the same outcomes. How different kinds of knowledge are valued, appraised and weighed in relation Chapter 5 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 92DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 92 25-9-2020 00:42:2025-9-2020 00:42:2093 to each other, for example, regarding effectiveness, efficiency or ethical concerns, is not clearly articulated. Nonetheless, guideline developers do recognise that other types of knowledge are often used and somehow integrated in practice, particularly when discussing the evidence and formulating recommendations, often called 'judgement' or 'considered judgement' (232, 233). This is the traditionally less clearly described or analysed black box part of the process that new initiatives try to shed a light on, such as NICE's structured tables linking evidence to recommendations and the GRADE Evidence to Decision frameworks (232). Table 1: Alternative types of reasoning to evade the problem of induction TYPE OF REASONING* (WITH EXAMPLES OF KEY SCHOLARS)SHORTHAND DESCRIPTION EXPLANATION Bayesian evasion (Bayes, Hacking)Learning from experience This type of inductive inference agrees with Hume that we cannot predict the future perfectly, but that we can learn from our experiences reasonably well. This allows us to do more and better predictions. This type of reasoning can update current beliefs with information from frequent events (informing prior probabilities and likelihood ratios). However, because we can learn from a single event too, this approach is suited for the individual case scenario (218) . Abduction (Peirce)Reasoning to the best explanationAbduction makes inferences by updating beliefs leading to the best explanation (234). Where Bayesian evasion takes prior probabilities as a given (at least as some argue), which may not be the case, abduction does not. It introduces the consideration of theory and mechanism in the act of inferring (235). Mechanistic/deterministic How things appear to work This type of reasoning makes an inference based on a mechanism. Illari et al (226) define a reasoning mechanism as consisting 'of entities and activities organised in such a way that they are responsible for the phenomenon'. Falsification (Popper)Trial and error Popper (236)30 agreed with Hume: we cannot say anything about the future, there are only theories that cannot even be proven. At best, we can only prove that they are wrong (falsifiable). This 'anti-inductivist' reasoning suggests to continue using a certain theory or practice and adjust if they fail. Precautionary principle In case of uncertainty about the future prevent harmThe precautionary principle, often used in environmental decision making and occupational health, favours to take preventive action in the face of uncertainty when making an inference. It puts 'the burden of proof to the proponents of an activity; exploring a wide range of alternatives to possibly harmful actions; and increasing public participation in decision making' (227, 237). Chapter 5 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 93DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 93 25-9-2020 00:42:2025-9-2020 00:42:2094 94 Means-to-ends reasoning Find ways to reach a goalThis type of reasoning asks the question what ways are there to reach a certain wanted outcome and which of those ways would be the more efficient? Often used in clinical consultations to make sure that something happens whatever the circumstances. The inference remains uncertain but less so by using multiple means that will lead to the same outcome (238). Logic of care (Mol)Taking care while the uncertain future unfoldsIn The Logic of Care, Annemarie Mol (225) suggests that healthcare is more like a 'practice' than it is about making choices. This approach puts emphasis on the importance of taking good care for the patient and the prevention of neglect. Inferring is a process that unfolds over time, while addressing many factors on the way. Non-analytical reasoning (Gigerenzer, Stolper )Using intuition Non-analytical reasoning such as heuristics and gut feelings (combination of heuristics and emotions (239)) used to make inferences. These types of reasoning are considered fast, intuitive and automatic thought processes. Gigerenzer showed that non-analytical reasoning can in certain environments outperform analytical reasoning in psychological, biological, sociological and economic inference tasks (240). * Types of reasoning are not exclusive and may overlap. They appear promising yet challenges remain. First, findings from ethnography question whether structured frameworks really influence or reflect guideline development processes (241, 242). In an ethnographic study of guideline development meetings, Moreira showed that guideline developers formulate guidance by combining different \"repertoires of evaluation , organised around four different epistemic criteria: robustness, usability, acceptability and adequacy\" (241). Importantly, such criteria are deployed at each stage of evidence appraisal: usability, acceptability and adequacy are integral to evidence assessment, rather than being easily categorised as either 'judgements' or 'additional considerations' as current evidence to decision frameworks suggest (232). Acknowledging the importance of these epistemic skills in evidence appraisal become much more important when it is understood that recommendations nearly always draw on different types of knowledge. Second, bringing knowledge together is not just a process of integrating, triangulation and finding a single answer. Knowledge from many sources is often conflicting, and indeed the exploration of opposing ideas is often very important. In social sciences, methods for evidence synthesis of other kinds of data have been developed and assessed in research (243) and in practice guideline development (223), but these have not yet been adopted routinely in healthcare guideline development. A process of integration is not just a technical, simple mechanistic process. Guideline development is a human, social process involving relevant stakeholders in discussion, debate and judgement. Therefore, the guideline devel opment processes also rely on a balanced and representative guideline committee that functions well (244). Finally, integrating many types of knowledge is not a process in which anything goes. Some integration processes are likely to be better than others. Guideline development needs to be trans parent and consistent so that reality, be it physical or social, can limit the inferences and recommendations made. We need a range of integration approaches depending on our understanding of what is true and Chapter 5 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 94DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 94 25-9-2020 00:42:2025-9-2020 00:42:2095 real. For example, integration of different knowl edge could be based on combinations of coherence (what fits best in a network of other theories), on consensus (what people agree on) and/or on correspondence (what links best to what is believed to be real). Given the current state of evidence to decision frameworks, there is still little guidance on how to robustly and consistently combine knowledge of different types without using the frequentist understanding of knowledge. A broader discussion within the guideline community is needed about the frameworks used to integrate and include different kinds of knowledge. Considering theories from epistemology and findings from ethnography (see Text box 5) could be instrumental to deepen our understanding of how other types of knowledge can be synthesised and integrated in guideline production. Text box 5: Theoretic and empirical concepts of integrating knowledge THEORETIC AND EMPIRICAL CONCEPTS OF INTEGRATING KNOWLEDGE William James was a philosopher of science who developed the idea of pragmatism, where many kinds of evidence can serve to support and continuously update beliefs about reality and truth within communities of people [1]. Another philosopher of science, the physicist Thomas Kuhn described how researchers within a research tradition develop and nourish theories which are overthrown, leading to the emergence of new paradigms [2]. Based on an ethnographic research on knowledge translation Gabbay and Le May coined the term \"mindlines\" to denote the continuously evolving, socially shared and mostly tacit knowledge that informs clinical practice [3]. Explicit knowledge from guidelines is incorporated into mindlines - where it is made sense of, challenged and integrated (or not) with practitioners' existing knowledge-in-practice-in-context. 1.

BMJ Br Med J 25-9-2020 00:42:2025-9-2020 00:42:2096 96 Conclusion The development of guideline recommendations is an interactive human process that requires a range of knowledge and experience including, but not exclusively, knowledge from frequency-based research, such as clinical trials. As in the clinical encounter, appraising and including different types of knowledge in guideline development should be used to make better inferences to guide decisions, but in practice, arguments are used to exclude some kinds of knowledge for a range of reasons, including concerns about introducing bias in frequentist reasoning. In this paper, we present important epistemological reasons to appraise and include a (wide) variety of different types of knowledge to highlight important aspects of guideline development that await further exploration and practical suggestions. We acknowledge that appraising and including knowledge from a different variety of sources is likely to be complex and ongoing. Discussions about purpose, reasoning and integration in guideline development will continue. A simple set of tools or methodological quick fixes are unlikely to suffice, and developing criteria for appraising and integrating different knowledge will remain a challenge. However, we believe that much can be done to help guideline developers improve this - now often implicit (8) practice that is central to their work. Capacity-building workshops that confront implicit forms of reasoning are one example. AID Knowledge runs such workshops annually at GIN conferences. They help to strengthen ties between guideline developers who are concerned about the increasingly rigid methodological constraints on guideline methods at the expense of fostering epistemic sensibilities. It is important for guideline developers to feel they are part of a community of practice that encourages epistemic skill development, rather than a hierarchical community where superior guideline methods are defined by a small group of experts. This will help to keep guideline development innovative and diverse. Acknowledging that dominant frequentist methods are excellent for some questions but do not fit all knowledge needs is the first step to implementing different kind of reasoning in guide- line development. How to address the diversity in methods for different kinds of questions should be among the top guideline research priorities.

With this guideline, the association also wanted to precipitate an attitude shift towards shared decision-making (SDM) and therefore integrated SDM in the CPG Palliative care for children. The aim was to gain insight if integrating SDM in CPGs can potentially encourage pediatricians to practice SDM. Its objectives were to explore pediatricians' attitudes and thoughts regarding (1) recommendations on SDM in CPGs in general and the guideline Palliative care for children specifically; (2) other SDM enhancing strategies or tools linked to CPGs. Methods Semi-structured face-to-face interviews. Pediatricians (15) were recruited through purposive sampling in three university-based pediatric centers in the Netherlands. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim, coded by at least two authors and analyzed with NVivo. Results Some pediatricians considered SDM a skill or attitude that cannot be addressed by clinical practice guidelines. According to others, however, clinical practice guidelines could enhance SDM. In case of the guideline Palliative care for children, the recommendations needed to focus more on how to practice SDM, and offer more detailed recommendations, preferring recommendations stating multiple options. Most interviewed pediatricians felt that patient decisions aids were beneficial to patients, and could ensure that all topics relevant to the patient are covered, even topics the pediatrician might not consider him or herself, or deems less important. Regardless of the perceived benefit, some pediatricians preferred providing the information themselves instead of using a patient decision aid. Conclusions For clinical practice guidelines to potentially enhance SDM, guideline developers should avoid blanket recommendations in the case of preference sensitive choices, and SDM should not be limited to recommendations on non-treatment decisions. Furthermore, preference sensitive recommendations are preferably linked with patient decision aids. Keywords Clinical practice guideline; is estimated that 750-1,000 children with a life-threatening illness die each year in the Netherlands and 5,000 children are diagnosed with a life-threatening illness (245). Of the 1,200 Dutch pediatricians, 60 pediatricians (being part of pediatric palliative teams in university medical centers) regularly encounter children with a life-threatening disease. Most Dutch pediatricians - and other healthcare professionals - infrequently encounter children who are in need of palliative care, making them less sure how to proceed in these cases. Moreover, a life- threatening illness has an enormous impact on both the parents and the child. The pediatrician can help in coping, and counseling on treatment related issues as well psycho-social aspects should start as early as possible. Furthermore, new developments in pediatric palliative care and limited knowledge thereof among pediatricians led to unwarranted practice variation (245, 246). The Dutch Association of Pediatricians therefore deemed it necessary to develop the clinical practice guideline (CPG) Palliative care for children to improve the quality of care for these children. The objective of this guideline is to provide pediatricians support and guidance when caring for children with a life-threatening disease. The guideline was published in the summer of 2013 (247). The introduction of the CPG Palliative care for children stresses the importance of knowing and discussing the needs of the patient and his or her parents. In addition to palliative intervention recommendations, the guideline consequently also contains recommendations on communication and shared decision-making (SDM) (see Box 1) (247). The underlying assumption of SDM models is that the doctor-patient relationship is based on mutual respect and on a joint interest to achieve the most beneficial outcomes for the patient, with partners sharing decisions. In this process it is important to understand the patients' preferences and values, and to acknowledge the doctor's expertise (248). However, it is still unclear if and how SDM can be incorporated in CPGs (199, 249-252). Van der Weijden et al described how guidelines can be adapted to facilitate SDM, e.g. by incorporating patient-centered questions, flagging recommendations for which considering patient preferences is particularly important, or by embedding relevant patient support tools (249). The Institute of Medicine recommends including patients in the guideline panels to address heterogeneity in patient preferences and include trade-offs in recommendations (157). Prior to 2013, only a few guidelines tried to do this (253-255). Sharing decisions in pediatric care is triadic in nature as parents or other care givers may be as much or even more involved as the child (256). Furthermore, in the Netherlands children have a right to be involved in deciding about their care from the age of 12 years (257). A majority of both parents and children prefer to participate in treatment decision-making and consider it an essential component of quality of care, together with relationship building, demonstration of effort and information exchange (258, 259). Chapter 6 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 101DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 101 25-9-2020 00:42:2125-9-2020 00:42:21102 102 Box 1: Quick overview of the CPG Palliative care for children Despite the large number of publications in support of children's (ethical) right - and desire - to participate in their own health care and decisions, pediatricians usually do not involve them in the decision-making. One reason being the clinicians' underestimation of children's capabilities, because of the children's age, pediatricians think they cannot or do not want to be involved in the decision making (260, 261). A national survey (2011) among Dutch pediatricians showed that 21% perceived a need to share the final responsibility for an end-of-life decision with the parents. Half of the respondents would inform parents and ask for their permission to discontinue treatment, and a quarter would merely inform parents (262). Reasons for not sharing the decision were: complexity/uncertainty of the decision at hand, and/or protecting the parents. Another important aim of the guideline Palliative care for children was therefore to trigger an attitude shift towards SDM in palliative pediatric care. The aim was to gain insight if integrating SDM in CPGs can potentially encourage pediatricians to practice SDM. Its objectives were to explore pediatricians' attitudes and thoughts regarding (1) recommendations on SDM in CPGs in general and the guideline Palliative care for children specifically; (2) other SDM enhancing strategies or tools linked to CPGs.CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE PALLIATIVE CARE FOR CHILDREN (NVK, 2013) The guideline consists of three chapters, each providing recommendations on the topic at hand. 1. Symptoms Recommendations on recognition and treatment of symptoms, such as anxiety, nausea, pain,spasticity and fatigue. 2. Communication & decision-making Recommendations on decision-making, such as: - Take into account the values and preferences of the child and/or parents; - Be conscious of the fact that decision-making is a continuous process; - Ask the child and/or parents at various moments which decision-making role they would like to have; - Cary out the conversations in a quiet, private and comfortable space; - Clarify mutual goals; - Confer with the child and the parents, [...], use nonprofessional language, and repeat what has been discussed; - Record the view of the parents in the patient file. 3. Organisation of palliative care Recommendations on the organisation of care, such as coordination & responsibilities, patient record, educating healthcare professionals and financing palliative care for children.Chapter 6 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 102DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 102 25-9-2020 00:42:2125-9-2020 00:42:21103 Methods We applied the Standards for reporting qualitative research (SRQR) and Consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative studies (COREQ) for this article (191, 263). Study design We conducted semi-structured, face-to-face interviews to gather 'deep' information and perceptions of the participating pediatricians using a phenomenological approach (264, 265). This qualitative research method emphasizes the importance of personal perspective and interpretation. It is a suitable method for gaining insight into participants' motivations and actions and understanding subjective experience. Researchers' characteristics The second author (LV) conducted the face-to-face interviews, with the assistance of JW and NW. LV, NW and JW were sixth year medicine students carrying out a science research internship at Maastricht University. There were no prior relationships between the participants and any of the authors. We informed the participants of the researchers' background and their roles in the PhD-research of the first author (DD), (1) at the time of recruitment, and (2) at the start of the interview. The interviewer (LV) had no previous experience with interviewing. She was trained on the job by TVDW and DD and closely supervised by the research team through regular meetings and feedback on audio-recorded interviews. Participants We purposively sampled pediatricians with experience in providing palliative pediatric care. The respondents were also purposeful sampled regarding tenure (professor, specialist, fellow); age; and gender. We recruited pediatricians from five subspecialty divisions: oncology, metabolic diseases, neurology, intensive care and neonatology at three university based pediatric centers in the Netherlands. These centers were UMCG, MUMC+ and Amsterdam UMC location AMC. We tailored the approach to each pediatric center to ensure timely recruitment of participants. Participants were approached via personal mailings sent by the author linked to the specific pediatric center or via personal invitations by one of the authors (LK, EV). The interviews took place at an office in the hospital in the second quarter of 2014. During the interview, only the participant and interviewer were present. Data collection Based on the relevant literature and the guideline Palliative care for children (PCFC), an interview guide was developed (266). Box 1 contains an overview of the (recommendations of the) guideline. The research team discussed the interview guide within the research team and the guide was piloted in two interviews. We followed an iterative approach; meaning that the interview guide was adjusted - if needed - in response to the preceding interviews (see Appendix 2).Chapter 6 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 103DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 103 25-9-2020 00:42:2225-9-2020 00:42:22104 104 During the pilot interviews, it became clear that not all participants might have an in-depth knowledge of the guideline PCFC. Consequently, it was decided that if the pediatrician was not familiar in detail with the guideline that the researcher would walk the pediatrician through the guideline and the SDM-recommendations at the start of the interview. In addition to the PCFC guideline, all participants were presented with two other SDM- approaches (249). First, participants were shown two patient decision aids (PDA) for children: one on anticoagulants and another on bone infection (267, 268). Second, we showed them the PCFC guideline recommendation on pain relief (Appendix 1) that we had rewritten so that it offered several options for pain relief and could stimulate discussion with the patient and/ or parents. Approval for the study protocol was granted by the Medical Ethical Committee of the University Medical Center Groningen, reference number M14.150.681/METc 2014.057 (10 February 2014). Verbal informed consent was gained from all participants, which included consent for use of anonymized quotes in publications. No follow-up interviews took place. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim by LV, JW and NW, with at least one author carrying out a reliability check on each transcript correcting any transcribing errors. The participants received the transcripts for comments, correction and approval (member check). Furthermore, LV made field notes before and after the interviews, and these were discussed with DD. Data analysis Data analysis was performed by using the constant comparative method (264). Three authors (LV, NW and DD) read and reread all transcripts independently. Text fragments related to the research questions were selected and coded. The research team did not identify themes or codes in advance. The codes were developed inductively, while reading the transcripts and making notes about selected fragments in the transcripts. After the first five transcripts, the researchers (LV, DD) compared their observations and developed preliminary coding categories. After analyzing individual interviews, we added and altered codes and categories in an iterative process. LV and DD discussed disagreement about the coding until consensus was reached. When all the interviews were analyzed and coded, we collected the codes in a preliminary coding scheme. Through axial analysis, we constructed (sub-) categories. LV and DD discussed and compared all the codes and categories resulting in the final coding scheme (see Appendix 3). Data analysis was supported by NVivo-software. The research team met to discuss and complete the study report and manuscript. We did not invite participants to provide feedback on the findings.Chapter 6 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 104DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 104 25-9-2020 00:42:2225-9-2020 00:42:22105 Results Sample In total 22 pediatricians were approached to be interviewed and 15 agreed to participate (Table 1). Three were moderately interested and preferred to decline, three did not respond and one pediatrician was not interested in the subject and declined. The participants consisted of two professors, 12 medical specialists, and one fellow. Nine of them had 15 years of experience or more. Data collection The 15 interviews lasted between 20 and 75 minutes (average 48 minutes). Data saturation occurred after eight interviews; no new codes emerged from the data.

Before describing the main findings, it is important to note that interviewees interpreted the term SDM differently. When asked to describe SDM, half of the participants referred to it as reaching a decision together with other clinicians, e.g. during a (multidisciplinary) team meeting without involving the patient. After providing participants with a commonly used definition of SDM, and briefly discussing the concept, several participants were of the opinion that if there was a clear superior treatment option, the decision should lie with the clinician and there was no need for patient involvement. Almost half of the participants found that patients and/or parents needed to be included only when there was not an obvious best choice (\"grey area\"), or when decisions were not treatment related, e.g. decisions about where to die or how to say their goodbyes. Furthermore, there seemed to be confusion between sharing decisions and who has the final responsibility for the decisions made. Some participants did not want to burden the patient/parents with the responsibility of deciding on their child's (end-of-life) care, stating: \"The parents have to live with that decision.\" (Participant 3). Possibility (or desirability) of CPGs enhancing the practice of SDM When asked if CPGs could potentially enhance SDM, the responses were mixed. About half of the participants mentioned that it could be helpful when there is disagreement; to make sure you cover all the relevant topics, including topics you yourself might consider less important, but are valuable to patients; and to ensure completeness of information provided. Some pediatricians commented that CPGs and SDM do not go together as they regarded CPGs paternalistic in principle and are therefore irreconcilable with SDM. Others thought it could be a good combination (Table 2). Another reason why some participants said that CPGs and SDM do not go together was because they regarded SDM an attitude or skill. A pediatrician is either willing or capable to share decisions with a patient or not, and adding SDM as a recommendation to a guideline will not change that attitude. \"It is the difference between 'the art of medicine' and 'medicine' \" , according to two participants (2 and 12). Several participants commented that to support SDM as a skill, the recommendations in the CPG needed to be more practical. For example: one of the guideline recommendations is to clarify and collaboratively set goals; but no practical guidance is offered on how to do this in clinical practice. Some participants, however, thought that incorporating recommendations on SDM in a CPG, might make it easier to practice it because e.g. it makes it less scary (see Table 2).Chapter 6 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 106DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 106 25-9-2020 00:42:2225-9-2020 00:42:22107 quotes on possibility (or desirability) of CPGs enhancing the practice of SDM THEME POSSIBILITY (OR DESIRABILITY) OF CPGS ENCOURAGING THE PRACTICE OF SDM ILLUSTRATIVE QUOTEINTERVIEW # Useful/helpful \"Perhaps it could help a clinician who is SDM-minded, but doesn't dare. I mean, if you aren't experienced in palliative care yet, it can be quite, um, scary.\" 3 \"Sure, especially when it comes down to points of disagreement, it can be helpful to choose a certain direction. In other guidelines, it is mentioned explicitly that you need to check with other specialists before you proceed. And with the patient and parents, of course. \"4 \"For some aspects, it could be the case that you yourself don't consider them, or that you are partial to certain things. But by mentioning all the aspects in a structured way in the guideline and discussing these with the patients, all topics that matter are covered.\"12 \"If you go through a list the patient probably thinks that you are a meticulous doctor who makes sure to tick all the boxes. However, it can also appear as being callous because it is not a conversation, you just go through the list.\"3 \"It must be useful when your peers have thought about it and decided to add recommendations on SDM, to support you or make it easier for you to do it yourself.\" 11 \"It means you can adhere to the guideline more often without you having to explain time and again why you didn't adhere.\"14 Guidelines are paternalistic \"A guideline will not immediately contribute to SDM. SDM depends on communication. And a guideline can obstruct that, as it says 'do this' and some people will claim that they are legally required to follow the guideline.\"13 \"Often guidelines say do A, B or C. They don't say consider A, B or C because there's the same amount of evidence. And if it would say consider A, B or C then you can discuss it with the parents.\" 1 SDM is an attitude/skill \"You don't need a guideline on how to have a conversation.\" 9 \"If doctors don't do SDM, a guideline will not make them do SDM.\" 1 \"I think that the way you involve the parents is 'the art of medicine' and not medicine. So, I think it comes down to the competencies of the doctor. You can't capture those in a guideline.\"2 SDM irrespective of guideline subject \"I don't think it will help to integrate SDM in the guideline. A guideline helps when there's no common sense. This is common sense.\"10 \"Maybe we need a guideline on SDM; namely involve the parents and the patient with every choice concerning their care. These two lines, easy as that.\"1Chapter 6 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 107DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 107 25-9-2020 00:42:2225-9-2020 00:42:22108 108 SDM integrated in guidelines Several options exist to address SDM in a guideline. The PCFC guideline opted to add recommendations on (shared) decision-making in the guideline as a separate chapter (see Box 1). The participants were asked how they felt about the innovative section on decision-making in the guideline. A participant noted that the recommendations on (shared) decision-making could help prepare the discussions with the patient/parents, and could help to put the patient in a social context. Several of the participants thought that most of the SDM-recommendations stated the obvious and that experienced pediatricians already practiced this. However, others said the recommendations might be useful for pediatricians who are less experienced or a bit hesitant. One participant indicated that the SDM-recommendations are valid for pediatrics in general and therefore need not be in this guideline. He suggested developing a separate guideline solely on SDM in pediatrics (see Table 3). Modifying a recommendation into an SDM-recommendation When showing the participants, the original single-option recommendation on pain relief and the modified multiple-option recommendation from the symptoms' section of the PCFC guideline (see Appendix 1), most participants preferred the modified recommendation. The modified recommendation was viewed as beneficial to engage patients/parents in the decision-making by showing considerations that are important to the patient/parents (Table 3). According to one participant the usefulness of the short, single-option recommendation versus the longer, multiple-option recommendation depends on the context, e.g. in acute or neonatal intensive care, the original - shorter - recommendation would be more useful. Views expressed by the participants working in neonatal intensive care reflected this notion. Table 3: Illustrative quotes on added value of SDM integrated in CPGs THEME ADDED VALUE OF SDM INTEGRATED IN THE GUIDELINE PCFC AND GUIDELINES IN GENERAL ILLUSTRATIVE QUOTEINTERVIEW # SDM-recommendations in guideline PCFC \"I feel that a disadvantage of this guideline is that, even though it is corroborated by evidence, that the recommendations state the obvious.\"1 \"If you write it down in such detail, I would like to know the added value for myself. What's in it for me when I have to deal with a high complex situation? However, do I think everyone applies these SDM- recommendations all the time in practice? No.\"10 \"If you are inexperienced, you can read these SDM-recommendations. I think it's nice, but they are not really practical.\"3 Modified multi-option(SDM) recommendation \"It's more agreeable. Also, because it contains the lines of reasoning.\" 6 \"It provides more information, more possibilities to consider.\" 11 \"This does represent the actual situation you're dealing with in practice. Do you as a doctor take the lead, or do you provide more options? So that the parents are in a position to choose as well.\"7 \"For the more complex decisions, of which there many in palliative care, it is beneficial to indicate the whole spectrum of care.\"12 \"It will probably, even if it's only subconsciously, prompt you to explain more to the parents, such as harms and alternatives, because it's right in front of you.\"5Chapter 6 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 108DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 108 25-9-2020 00:42:2225-9-2020 00:42:22109 \"Nothing is black and white. And then it is nice that the guideline also provides alternatives that meet a certain standard; it prompts you to more discussion on what to do.\"14 \"The SDM-recommendation requires more deliberation and demands more of your communication skills.\" 13 \"I would like to know the evidence base of each item mentioned. If it's part of the guideline, I would question if it was properly assessed.\" 10 \"And, there is of course a balance in what makes a guideline practical. You cannot include all the literature, because then it would no longer be a practical guideline.\" 15 \"If you want you can put everything in a guideline. I don't believe that's the way to go.\"5 \"Especially for the doctors who are being trained, nurses and physician assistants who are less experienced, have less knowledge, they will need a very clear guideline.\" 13 Usefulness of a PDA accompanying a guideline Another option to address SDM in guidelines is paring a specific conditional recommendation with a PDA. A conditional recommendation is used when the underlying evidence is scarce or conflicting, or when more than one relevant treatment options is available. For conditional recommendations, it is known that an individual patient values the uncertainties and trade-offs differently compared to other patients (202). Although most participants perceived the PDA to be beneficial for the patient/parents, but to a lesser degree for themselves. Most of the participants preferred to convey the information mentioned in the PDA in person, out of fear of losing rapport with the patient when looking at a piece of paper or tablet during a consultation. Others believed patients/parents would not want to use PDAs. Some interviewed pediatricians expressed that the PDAs contained useful topics they would normally not address during consultation, and suggested it could be used as a checklist to ensure important topics were covered. Two participants mentioned that patients/parents often do not remember everything mentioned during a consultation and that PDAs are ideal for patients as a reference document to take home, re-read and reflect on what was discussed (see Table 4). Table 4: Illustrative quotes on usefulness of a PDA accompanying the CPG THEME USEFULNESS OF A PDA ACCOMPANYING THE CPG INTERVIEW # ILLUSTRATIVE QUOTE Usefulness of PDAs to patient/parents \"If the effects [of the interventions] are the same, then of course the parents can make the decision. And it's quite neat to have all the pros and cons on paper.\"5 \"I must honestly say, based on what I'm seeing right now, it would be nice to hand them [patient/parents] something. If they want to think about it, they can weigh the pros and cons.\"7 \"It can indeed be handy to make a decision, because sometimes the practicalities of a treatment decision elude you [as a doctor], but those can be very important to the parents.\"12 \"It is easy to have something like that, listing all the points. It won't make it easier, but it will make it more transparent. We don't have a lot of those yet, do we?\"13 \"You can discuss it and read it again later. And it's way better than my illegible handwriting.\"14Chapter 6 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 109DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd patients remember only 20% of what's being discussed. And, because you can give it to take home, it means that people don't need to make on the spot decisions during consultation.\"14 \"I'm not sure if these make it much clearer. It could also complicate matters for patients, these kind of choices.\"7 \"I think it's a lot of text. I don't think patients will read it.\" 9 \"It's more of a checklist for myself, not something you go through together.\" 11 Usefulness of PDAs to pediatricians \"When I look at it, I immediately notice that it covers a dilemma we deal with a lot. And it is actually a nice format, so I definitely think it's of use to us. Can you email it to me?\"6 \"I think so. It shows you the experience of others in these instances, what they did. And it also gives you an idea of what to ask in cases you yourself are a bit hesitant about.\"11 \"Sometimes when talking to parents, you notice they get confused, and you need to tell more. If you can show it with visuals like this, is even better.\"13 \"Yes, I think it's really practical: not a lot of text and it looks appealing. Most of it, is in your head, but this makes the considerations really explicit. And translates it directly to aspects patients care about.\"15 \"It doesn't need to be part of a guideline, I can do it myself.\" 1 \"I'd prefer to explain it myself. It is part of being a doctor. You'll notice a response, a hesitation. And as a doctor, you prefer some medicines yourself, because you're more familiar with them and you'll advise those.\"4 \"No, I can do that myself. I'm more inclined, on the basis of my experience and taking the patient into account, to take the lead and say: 'I think this is the best medicine'.\"7 \"I think I can explain it easily in 5 minutes. The question is whether that is true. Okay, you're making me reconsider my answer.\"7 \"I don't think I would use it. I feel a bigger urge to look the patient in the eyes and tell them what's it about.\"10 \"I don't think it's right. I suppose additional explanations are needed? But, I think they're risky, because it will affect the verbal communication negatively.\"13 Discussion Several participants acknowledged the added value of SDM being included in the guideline PCFC, and more participants were of the opinion that guidelines in general potentially could enhance SDM. Regarding the specific SDM-recommendations in the PCFC guideline, several participants judged these as stating the obvious and lacking detail and practical guidance. Some even said they were offended by these recommendations, perceiving it as an attack on their professionalism because they already do this. Clinical observations, however, have shown that SDM during patient contacts is not standard practice yet. Clinicians think or say that they practice SDM, but when their interactions with patients are analysed , it appears that the level of SDM leaves room for improvement (67, 68, 252, 269, 270). The felt attack could perhaps be unjust because of optimistic bias. Furthermore, research suggests that there seems to be a tendency with clinicians to share non-treatment related decisions with patients, and to share the treatment related decisions to a lesser degree (271, 272). When it concerns children, this could be expected as parents and health professionals might take a protective stance towards the child. However, the child might prefer to be protected in some situations and wants to share decision-making in other situations. In addition, some children prefer to leave the more 'serious' decisions to their parents and healthcare professionals, whereas other children prefer to share the decision (261, 273). The Chapter 6 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 110DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 110 25-9-2020 00:42:2225-9-2020 00:42:22111 views expressed by the participants seemed to confirm that mainly the non-treatment related decisions where shared, or the less 'serious' ones. Combined with the situation that the clinician 'decides' which information to share with a patient, the stage for SDM is not ideal (69, 270, 274). The intention of the Dutch Pediatric Association was to potentially enhance the practice of SDM in pediatric palliative care and to do so by integrating SDM in the guideline PCFC. Therefore, recommendations on SDM were included in the guideline and the necessity of SDM was explained in a separate chapter. However, these SDM-recommendations have not been integrated in the treatment related recommendations. The integration of SDM could be done e.g. by re-phrasing these recommendations to increase option awareness and/or to include patient preferences. Other possibilities are to structure the deliberation process and describe it more explicit in the guideline, and/or providing patient support tools (275). These tools could be linked to a specific recommendation or to the guideline as a whole (249). In the current format, the guideline might not encourage the interviewed pediatricians to involve patients/parents when talking about treatment choices which might inadvertently contribute to SDM only being used for non-treatment related decisions in children's palliative care. Participants were open to recommendations related to an SDM-approach to treatment decisions (i.e. structuring the options in a recommendation to increase option awareness), as was shown when we discussed the modified recommendation on pain relief. More than half preferred the 'SDM'-recommendation because it can help open the discussion, it shows underlying arguments for different treatments, such as pros and cons, and it enables patients and/or parents to choose. Recommendations such as these are preferable according to the Institute of Medicine (IoM). In its report 'Clinical practice guidelines we can trust', IoM suggests refraining from so-called blanket recommendations: a recommendation for all patients to choose one particular treatment, irrespective of the patient's characteristics, preferences and values. IoM recommends to describe the options and trade-offs in a recommendation encouraging SDM, as its respects the individual choice. In this way guidelines, according to IoM, become tools for patient engagement and activation (157). The last couple of years more CPGs are being developed in which recommendations address trade-offs and mention more than one option (199, 209, 276-278). Another strategy to adapt guidelines so that they could enhance SDM is imbedding patient support tools - such as PDAs - in CPGs. The majority of participants thought that a guideline (recommendation) accompanied by a PDA would be beneficial to engaging patients and sharing the decision-making. Systematic reviews have shown that the use of PDAs supports patients to engage in deciding about their care (279). Our interviews suggest that the use of PDAs could also help pediatricians to check if they have covered all the topics (PDA as a checklist) and address issues they would normally forget or not consider important. Another benefit of PDAs mentioned by pediatricians was that patients can take the PDA home and reread it. Patients often do not remember everything when talking with the clinician, and by taking it home they can weigh the pros and cons in a more comfortable and less time-pressured setting. PDAs can also help patients to ask questions, as patients not always dare to ask their pediatrician everything (280, 281). The pediatricians who were not convinced of the benefit of a PDA Chapter 6 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 111DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 111 25-9-2020 00:42:2225-9-2020 00:42:22112 112 claimed that patients did not want to use them (251). Research has shown that patients do want to be involved in (deciding about) their care, and need to be involved (166, 269, 282), including children and adolescents (and their parents) (283-288). Another reason why some pediatricians were not inclined to use a PDA was that they felt they know best what to advise based on their expertise, experience with the treatments and the patient sitting in front of them. This attitude is risky for three reasons; firstly, well-informed patients who actively participate in their care are more satisfied with their decisions (289). Secondly, without using a PDA, the clinician will likely not be complete when providing information to the patient (69, 274). And thirdly, it has also been shown that clinicians are not always correct in predicting what the patient wants (32, 63). Moreover, the preferences of a clinician, from the perspective of being a patient herself or himself, often do not match with what they would recommend the patient (174). Instead of projecting their own opinion on their patients, clinicians should ask what the patient prefers; not only when it concerns treatment decisions but also when it comes to being involved and deciding about their care. Another important finding is that participants were worried about burdening parents with the responsibility of deciding on their child's end-of-life care if they engaged them in SDM. However, instead of assuming that parents do not want to be burdened with this responsibility, discussing this with the parents, and/or child, acknowledging their autonomy in the decision-making process, seems to be justified and fitting with SDM. Some research has shown that parents want to be the ultimate decision maker for their child (290), and children value autonomous decision-making, without excluding their parents (286, 291). In the interviews the pediatricians used the words responsibility and sharing the decision-making interchangeably. It appears that the pediatricians are not aware that even when the decision-making is shared with the child and/or parents, they have the final responsibility for the decision. This unclarity might make pediatricians wary of SDM when it comes to sharing decisions. Regarding the comments made by the pediatricians that SDM is a skill, and that the recommendations in the PCFC guideline mainly addressed the what and not the how of SDM, the guideline could be enriched with examples of SDM in the pediatric palliative care context. For example, Van der Weijden et al suggest using a vignette describing how a patient and a healthcare provider discuss the options to reach a shared decision, or could provide scripts modelling SDM-language. However, enhancement of the practice of shared decision-making requires more than an isolated guideline which integrates SDM, especially when it comes to skills and attitude. It needs to be imbedded in an overall SDM contextualized effort for SDM to become common practice. Healthcare professionals could be trained, receive feedback on SDM-performance, be facilitated in an SDM-approach, work in organizations which advocate SDM and where there is senior-level buy-in of engaging patients in their care and sharing the decision-making with them (252, 270). Limitations and strengths Limitations of this study are that the findings are limited to the 15 participants and the university medical centers (3) they work at. Even though the participating centers were considered forerunners of SDM, it does not mean that other pediatricians in other medical centers have the Chapter 6 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 112DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 112 25-9-2020 00:42:2225-9-2020 00:42:22113 same opinions. However, data saturation occurred after the eight interviews. Another limitation was the timing of the interviews; in hindsight, the interviews might have taken place too early as the guideline PCFC had not been fully implemented yet. Which meant that most of the participants had not used the guideline yet, and some had only heard of it. This was countered by showing the participants the guideline and by walking through the recommendations on SDM. Key strengths were that we conducted the research with the developers of the PCFC guideline themselves (EV, LK) and that participants were very forthcoming and open during the interviews as they were being interviewed by a doctor to be. We also carried out a member check on the interview transcripts. Conclusions The interviews showed that most of the participants thought that CPGs in general potentially could enhance SDM. However, integrating SDM into a guideline seems not to be an easy feat, and guideline developers have to walk a tightrope on how to formulate recommendations on SDM. They have to avoid stating the obvious because it might offend and alienate the pediatrician. At the same time, they have to provide more detail on how to practice SDM. Furthermore, developers could consider formulating more 'open' recommendations. Especially in case of preference sensitive choices, the recommendation should describe (treatment) trade- offs and (treatment) alternatives and provide more detailed guidance. Another consideration is to provide tools amalgamated with specific guideline recommendations that enhance SDM, such as PDAs.

Second, it provides an overview of the study results in the main findings. The strengths and limitations of this thesis are described next. After that, I will return to the concerns as described in the (worlds of the) introduction while reflecting on the main findings and compare these findings to other research. Finally, I present the conclusions on tools and knowledge, the needs of healthcare professionals, and recommendations for practice, research and policy. Aim & research questions Knowledge in health care is vast and accumulating fast. Next to knowledge from scientific research, data and knowledge from clinical practice and on patient preferences, experiences and outcome are becoming more readily available. To make all this knowledge available to healthcare professionals and patients in a timely matter and in such a way that it is easy to digest and apply, tools are developed. These tools support knowledge translation and (shared) decision-making. Knowledge translation is \"the synthesis, dissemination, exchange, and ethically sound application of knowledge to improve health, provide more effective health services and products, and strengthen the healthcare system\" (292). Shared decision-making (SDM) is defined as \"an approach where clinicians and patients share the best available evidence when faced with the task of making decisions, and where patients are supported to consider options, to achieve informed preferences\" (293). The aim of this thesis was fourfold. Firstly, in the domains of health care (curative, palliative care, long term care and public health) tool types are no longer developed without a clear definition and use (chapters 2 and 3). Secondly, there exists a common terminology when referring to tool types (chapters 3 and 4). Thirdly, to make better use of the different knowledge sources available (chapter 5), and finally provide healthcare professionals and patients, and possibly other users such as policy advisors and insurers, with a set of pragmatic tools that cover their needs in knowledge translation and decision support (chapters 3 and 6). The following research questions were formulated: 1. What tool types to translate knowledge and support (shared) decision-making are available to healthcare professionals (and patients) in the Netherlands? (Chapter 2) 2. How are these tool types defined and does consensus exist on the definitions across the healthcare domains in the Netherlands? (Chapters 2 and 3) 3. Which criteria do these tool types need to meet and which purposes do they serve so that healthcare professionals and patients consider them trustworthy and useful? (Chapter 4) 4. Do we consider all knowledge sources when developing tools, and what does that mean for tool development? (Chapter 5) 5. What are healthcare professionals' needs using tools for knowledge translation and shared decision-making? (Chapter 6)Chapter 7 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 123DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 123 25-9-2020 00:42:2425-9-2020 00:42:24124 124 Main findings The first research question, and part of the second research question, was addressed by carrying out a scoping review (chapter two). A scoping review examines the extent and nature of research activity; it does not depict research findings in any detail but maps fields of study where it is difficult to visualize the range of material that could be available (93). The review looked at 20 national organisations that develop and disseminate knowledge tools. A knowledge tool is defined as a tool that distils, synthesizes and interprets the highest quality knowledge and research to serve knowledge translation and support (shared) decision-making. A tool type refers to a category, a kind of tool such as clinical practice guidelines (CPG) and patient decision aids (PDA). The clinical practice guideline Palliative care for children is considered a tool, not a tool type. When referring to a tool type such as clinical practice guidelines, it is in general and not to a specific guideline on a certain subject. The scoping review revealed numerous tool types. Even though only a limited set of national organisations that develop tools within the curative and palliative domain were included in the review, and thus disregarding locally, commercially and internationally developed tools, 126 tool types were found. Sixty-four of those were included in the review. Most of the tool types were ill defined or no definition was provided at all. The majority of these tool types were aimed primarily at healthcare professionals, a few at patients, and almost none (primarily) at policy advisors. A shared common terminology and mutual understanding of tool types in an ever increasing multidisciplinary and multi-level stakeholders' involvement is deemed necessary for the development and use of these tool types. Preferably the definition of a tool type contained a description of the tool, its goal and its target user(s). This was one of the results of the RAND-modified Delphi-procedure (chapter three). The aim of the Delphi-procedure was first to reach nationwide consensus on the definitions of knowledge tool types. And two, to limit the number of tool types in the Netherlands. Thus, answering thesis research question two. The participants of the Delphi procedure were from various domains in health care such as curative and long term care, tool developers, scientists, practitioners, and government. These participants reached agreement on a set of nine tool types, which they considered important for knowledge translation and (shared) decision- making. Furthermore, they reached consensus on the definitions of five tool types within that set of nine tool types. These five tools were: clinical practice guideline, summary, flow chart, patient decision aid and protocol (of clinical practice guideline). As the Netherlands were not the only country dealing with an abundance of ill-defined knowledge tool types, the third research question was dealt with on an international level. Therefore, a group of international experts with different backgrounds developed - during an evidence-informed consensus meeting - a framework for patient-directed knowledge tool types (chapter four). The experts decided to start with patient-directed knowledge tool types instead of a broader set of tool types, as developing a framework for just patient-directed knowledge tool types would be difficult enough. Expanding to other tool types could be a next step. Patient-directed knowledge tools are directly aimed at patients and their next of kin, not at their Chapter 7 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 124DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 124 25-9-2020 00:42:2425-9-2020 00:42:24125 representatives such as patient coaches or patient organisations. The developed framework stated the purposes of these tool types and their core elements. The aim of this framework was to create clarity not only on what kind of patient-directed knowledge tool types exist but also which elements they prototypically should contain and to support tool developers and commissioners of tool development to decide when to develop which tool. The framework can also help healthcare professionals, patients and possibly policy advisors when to use which tool type. The framework needs further testing and probing by a larger group of stakeholders, which is why it was presented as a working framework. As was mentioned before, a knowledge tool distils, synthesizes and interprets the highest quality knowledge and research to serve knowledge translation and support (shared) decision- making. But do these tools consider and use all the knowledge sources available? Even though efforts are being made that clinical practice guidelines use different knowledge sources, there still seems to be a preference for scientific evidence. Furthermore, the hierarchy within scientific evidence seems to be very persistent; systematic reviews (SR) and randomized clinical trials (RCT) are often the preferred knowledge source. However, RCTs may be unavailable or not provide the most suitable knowledge. Therefore, the GIN Working Group Appraising and Including Different (AID) Knowledge attempted first to draw (more) attention to the different existing knowledge sources, the exclusion of some of these sources, or using them implicitly without acknowledging them. And second, the Working Group attempted to indicate how to use these different knowledge sources, and showing possible flaws when mainly SRs and RCTs are used when developing tools such as clinical practice guidelines. The working group did this during several consecutive workshops at the annual conferences of the Guidelines International Network (GIN). It resulted in presenting important epistemological1 reasons to appraise and include a (wider) variety of different types of knowledge when developing guidelines. Appraising and integrating different knowledge will remain a challenge. However, the G-I-N Working Group AID Knowledge believes that much can be done to help guideline developers improve this. By appraising and including different types of knowledge in guideline development, guidelines will contribute to better inferences guiding decisions (chapter 5). To find out what the needs of healthcare professionals are regarding knowledge tools, paediatricians were asked to reflect on tool types and strategies that integrated clinical knowledge and shared decision-making (chapter 6). Paediatricians reviewed and assessed the Dutch clinical practice guideline Palliative Care for Children (2013), that has a separate chapter on shared decision-making including communication recommendations. Other tools and strategies were patient decision aids and altered recommendations on pain relief of the Palliative care for children guideline. The altered recommendations included patient preferences regarding pain relief. Most of the interviewed paediatricians indicated that clinical practice guidelines could enhance the practice of shared decision-making; and did not think that guidelines and shared decision-making were mutually exclusive. They also thought integrating shared decision-making in a guideline was of added value for guidelines in general. Although 1 Epistemology is the branch of philosophy concerned with the theory of knowledge (source https://en.wikipedia. org/wiki/Epistemology) . The theory of knowledge and understanding, especially regarding its methods, validity, and scope, and the distinction between justified belief and opinion; (as a count noun) a particular theory of knowledge and understanding (source: Oxford English Dictionary). Date: 1st August 2019.Chapter 7 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 125DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 125 25-9-2020 00:42:2525-9-2020 00:42:25126 126 for the clinical practice guideline Palliative Care for Children it would have been more helpful if the guideline would have made clear how to practice shared decision-making instead of just recommending it. Modified guideline recommendations, in such a way that they prompted asking for or clarified patient preferences were in majority regarded as useful strategies to enhance shared decision-making. Which was also the case for providing patient decisions aids together with the guideline. SDM does not concern just non-treatment related decisions but also treatment related decisions. Strengths & limitations For the research in this thesis, I have chosen a predominant qualitative research approach. This was done for several reasons. First of all, the research is of an exploratory nature and a better, detailed understanding of a complex issue, requiring inductive and deductive reasoning was needed. Moreover, quantitative methods and statistical analyses seemed not to fit the research questions (264). On the one hand, I was after improved understanding of perspectives, experiences, opinions, attitudes concerning the use and translation of knowledge, knowledge tool types, and comprehension of the needs of healthcare professionals when using these tool types. On the other hand, I tried to reach consensus on (developing) criteria and purposes of these tool types. First, I will reflect on the different studies described in this thesis, the various methods and settings used suitable for a policy oriented thesis that also looks at the primary process in the end. However, related to qualitative research certain strengths and limitations should be mentioned. These will be addressed when reflecting respectively on credibility, transferability and dependability of the research per chapter and overall for the thesis. Credibility refers to the believability and trustworthiness of the findings. In qualitative research, the richness of data is important and that participants feel the findings are credible and accurate. Transferability is about the generalizability of the data. Dependability concerns the consistency with which the findings can be repeated and will result in similar findings. It is also interlinked with the chosen research method (294). The terms 'credibility', 'transferability' and 'dependability' are also known respectively as 'internal validity', 'external validity' and 'reliability' and these terms can be loosely matched respectively with the terms 'validity', 'generalizability', 'reliability' and 'replication' which are more common in quantitative research (295). We tried to accomplish the credibility, transferability and dependability via several approaches. Credibility To achieve credibility a number of approaches were used. Regarding the scoping review (chapter 2; Dutch chaos case) a broad range of different organisations were included to ensure a good overview of the Dutch situation concerning the availability of knowledge tools. Furthermore, an iterative approach was used to reveal possible additional new sources to be considered. The findings were spot-checked twice independently by the co-authors. A scoping review is not as thorough as a systematic review, combined with the restriction to curative and palliative care, this could mean that some tool types were missed. The aim however was to prove the hypothesis that there existed numerous knowledge tool types in the Netherlands and not to achieve an exhaustive overview of these tools. Chapter 7 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 126DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 126 25-9-2020 00:42:2525-9-2020 00:42:25127 To ensure the credibility of the Delphi-study (chapter 3) the results of each round were shared with all participants, quantitative as well as qualitative, including the decisions the project group made based on the results. They also had the opportunity to ask questions anonymously, regarding the process, method and the outcomes. Moreover, the chosen Delphi-method was copied from the RAND cooperation, which has a lot of experience with this method. Shortcomings were that although we invited participants from all domains in health care, some domains were limited or not represented, for example health insurers; their perspective was missed in the Delphi. As the number of participants was well above the required minimum we felt that we mitigated this limitation. Another limitation could have been the accuracy of the experts' answers. That is why we chose a broad selection of participants with different backgrounds and expertise, instead of a small panel of experts, and shared all the participants' responses during and at the end of the Delphi procedure. The experts participating in developing the framework of patient-directed tool types (chapter 4) were involved almost during the whole process. They developed the framework during the meeting and discussed it when finalising it via e-mail. Before publication they gave their approval. The elements of the framework were cross-checked with existing literature. A potential weakness was the extent to which the participants were involved in the subject. This was counteracted by establishing a group consisting of participants with different expertise and from various backgrounds, and by providing information beforehand so we started with a common ground. The GIN Working group AID Knowledge (chapter 5) held open invitation workshops in which they presented the issue at hand. The participants, delegates of GIN conferences from all over the world, were asked for their input and feedback. The minutes were shared and participants were invited to comment. One could say that because of the highbrow character of the subject, interest in the subject is limited and participants do not represent the average group of people involved. We counteracted that with a group that has representatives with theoretical, practice and policy backgrounds. Additionally, literature and earlier research was also used as a basis and for comparison. Credibility measures within chapter six (interviews with paediatricians) were member checking and independent coding by three 3 authors. Also, field notes were taken and discussed to reveal possible biases. Credibility could have been improved further by giving the participants the opportunity to comment on the analysis findings. Due to time constraints with the research team and the participants themselves this was deemed unfeasible. Transferability Transferability of the data is a slightly more complicated matter and is regarded limited. Partially because the research was mainly executed with tool types used in the Netherlands and a Dutch clinical practice guideline (respectively chapters two, three and six). Also, transferability is limited because part of the research was meant as a starting point to be followed through. However, moving from the scoping review to the Delphi-study more healthcare domains were included. The former covered curative and palliative care and the latter included long term care and public health as well. The newly added domains did not suggest many new tool types to be included in the Delphi. Which could suggest that the scoping review data sufficiently covered tool types used in long term care and public health for a large part as well. Outcomes Chapter 7 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 127DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 127 25-9-2020 00:42:2525-9-2020 00:42:25128 128 of the review and Delphi were compared with other studies. Although glossaries existed of healthcare terms and some tools, and reviews of one specific tool type, similar exercises as carried out in the Netherlands were not found. The approach of the review and the Delphi could be repeated in other countries and/or in an international setting to see if it renders comparable results. Though this might be more a criterion for dependability. The data of the scoping review and Delphi-study were transferred to an international setting when developing the framework of patient-directed knowledge tools (chapter four). Again, the international experts did not add many new tool types when developing the framework. They, however, constricted themselves to patient-directed tool types. Possibly the framework could be transferred to other populations, such as healthcare providers or policy advisors, and the set up with purposes and core elements could be maintained. It is doubtful if the purposes and core elements would be (exactly) the same content wise, as the target group(s) of the tool types differ. The findings of the study concerning different kinds of knowledge and different kinds of reasoning (chapter five) might be transferable to other domains. Not just health care tries to be as much evidence-based as possible to decide what is 'the best' way to go forward and to change practice and policy. Evidence-based working is becoming more eminent in other domains such as policy decision-making and the practice of law as well (296), even though they might have different knowledge sources and have not progressed as far with the evidence- based approach yet, they have to deal with some of the same issues and pitfalls as health care has. The findings of the interviews regarding integrating knowledge translation tools with shared decision making (chapter six) could be transferred to guidelines on other subjects and guidelines for other healthcare professionals than paediatricians. Guideline developments groups are increasingly looking into how they can incorporate patient perspective and preferences in the clinical practice guidelines. Dependability Qualitative research is characterised by fluid structures, which change because of incoming and available data. Therefore, for each study the approach and/or method chosen and the changes therein, if any, were exhaustively described. Furthermore, proven methods such as the RAND-modified Delphi were used. Another limitation of qualitative data (but also of quantitative research) is that non-reported data can disappear. By being transparent about the found and used data, making them available with the publication of each article or on request, this limitation is hopefully addressed. That does not mean that findings will be similar if the studies were to be repeated. Reasons why findings might be different could be due to firstly different participants in the Delphi-study, interviews and invitational meeting, or original participants might have gained more knowledge on the subject and changed their mind. Secondly there might have been developments since the studies were executed which could affect settings and the findings; for example, the uptake of a core set of tool types and the definitions of these tool types and a revised clinical practice guideline Palliative care for children. Thirdly, different researchers with another mind-set might infer different conclusions, as qualitative research is more subjective in nature and is influenced by the researcher. That is why, the research was executed under supervision and within a team, so that not one perspective could get the upper hand. Field notes were taken and discussed to Chapter 7 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 128DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 128 25-9-2020 00:42:2525-9-2020 00:42:25129 discern and mitigate possible biases. To prevent that the perspective of the researchers was not clear to outsiders, the research was put into context (also called 'confirmability'). By being aware of this and acknowledging these experiences and beliefs, we tried to be as open minded as possible, and not to dismiss any data of face value. Another means to increase dependability, the so-called SRQR and/or COREQ checklists were applied for all the studies in this thesis, except chapter five. SRQR stands for 'Standards for reporting qualitative research' and consists of 21 items. The aim of the checklist is to improve the transparency of all aspects of qualitative research. COREQ is the abbreviation of 'Consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research' and focuses on interviews and focus groups. It aims for explicit and comprehensive reporting of qualitative studies by providing a 32-item checklist helping researchers to report on aspects such as the research team, study methods, context of the study, findings, analysis and interpretations (191, 263). Planned versus realised Related to dependability is the chosen research method. The method was chosen after formulating the aim and the research question(s). However, when I started my thesis, the research plan consisted of two parts: a theoretical part and an empirical one. The empirical part was to test some of the findings yielded by the theoretical research, in clinical practice. The findings of the theoretical part could have been corroborated, refined or disproven. It would have made the results more robust and additionally, it would have put the results more into context. Due to personal health circumstances, I had to put aside much of the work done by Lotte Veul, Nicole Wijnands (systematic review) and Jonne Westermann (patient file audit). This was unfortunate for me but even more for them. Despite this, I think the remaining empirical chapter (chapter six; interviews) - to which all three contributed - shows the value of letting practitioners reflect on what the clinical practice guideline Palliative care for children wanted to achieve and how it was received. Breadth versus depth Lastly, this thesis does not always delve as deep as other theses do. This could be considered a weakness. However, I would prefer to regard the thesis approach as a strength, as it tries to present a integral, complex picture, building bridges between (perceived as) separate worlds, and it searches for links and connections between and draws from different scientific fields. By having worked in different areas of health care, but also outside health care enables me not only to discern the gaps between the different areas more clearly but also enables me to see where the different areas overlap, both inside and outside health care. Which is a reflection of my background, having been and still being embedded in policy, research and partly in healthcare practice. Funding Funding (in kind) and means were provided by Maastricht provided their expertise in kind (chapter three). The researcher received no funds from commercial organisations.Chapter 7 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 129DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 129 25-9-2020 00:42:2525-9-2020 00:42:25130 130 Tools and knowledge The following section provides a somewhat deeper reflection on the main issues encountered, as well as comparisons with the current literature while returning to the concerns as described in the (worlds of the) introduction of this thesis. As there are many issues relevant to the uptake of knowledge and the use of tools, I focus on four overarching issues. Be more precise and stick to it One way of coping with the vast and expanding knowledge body (in 2007 11 new systematic reviews each day, nowadays 82 systematic reviews according to KSR Evidence) in health care is to develop tools. Tools that assist knowledge translation and support evidence-informed (shared) decision making, in short knowledge tools. These tools synthesize and interpret knowledge and in this way help to get research from 'bench to bedside' (73), or as it is called in the domain of knowledge translation (KT) in health care: 'moving knowledge to use' (292). And while we are very conscious and deliberate regarding the 'defining and interpretation' of evidence, for example when developing clinical practice guidelines (297, 298), we seem to be more careless when it comes to defining and explaining knowledge tools. A multitude of tool types is available to clinicians and patients, and they are mostly ill defined. There is no common shared terminology, which is key for development, implementation and use of these tools, which in turn might impede knowledge translation in health care. Not a lot of similar research has been found on defining tool types at a (inter)national level and limiting the number of tool types, but there have been several appeals to reduce the number of tool types with the aim to increase clarity and use, and so improve quality of health care and to be more vigilant about defining tools (70, 112). Stiggelbout (88) did so in 2010 when reviewing the definition and classification of patient decision aids and Blume did so in 2016 when looking at external demands, among which knowledge tools hospitals have to comply with in order to deliver high quality and safe care (80, 299). Already in 1992, Norma Lange made an acute observation when explaining the trouble if we cannot define things; if we cannot define it, we cannot control it, practice it, teach it, finance it, or put in into practice (112). Stakeholders reaching consensus on a national level on a core set of tool types and their definitions in the Netherlands was a promising first step. Several Dutch tool developers even decided to use or adopt the core set and to assign funding only to developing tool types belonging to this core set. However, real life practice proved (as expected) to be more wilful. For example, one of the stakeholders involved in the consensus procedure felt it necessary to re-do the exercise of defining the tool types for the benefit of their own organisation's rank and file acceptance (300, 301). Furthermore, it seems that with an expanding knowledge base, the tool box keeps expanding as well. New tool types are still emerging, or they appear to be. The National Health Care Institute is for example working on a tool type called 'care tree' (107), which in essence is a digital decision tree. Another example is the 'quality standard'. In the Delphi study it was considered an umbrella term for tool types such as clinical practice guidelines and care standards, and it Chapter 7 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 130DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 130 25-9-2020 00:42:2525-9-2020 00:42:25131 still is described as such in the document \"Toetsingskader' (Quality assessment framework) (302), however in recent years the term has been used for a tool type in its own right (303- 305). This begs the question if these new tool types, are actually new tools or similar tool types with new names. This was illustrated by a study by De Bleser et al carried out in 2006 regarding the tool type 'clinical pathway'; they found 84 different definitions (70). These findings are reminiscent of Walshe's characterization of developments in the quality improvement (QI) domain. He described how a similar set of quality improvement ideas and methods are presented repeatedly under different names and terminologies, and called it pseudo innovation. He 'blamed' the human tendency to be allured by the new and improved. And healthcare is not immune to it either. When embracing new ideas (or tool types in this case) we should ask ourselves are they really new and are they really an improvement. Constantly introducing 'new' tool types is in contradiction with Deming's first principle of quality management: the need for constancy of purpose (108). The uptake and use of tools in health care is usually poor (42, 148). Although the amount of tool types has not been the (main) focus of tool implementation research, it could be a factor just as it is suspected in QI. And perhaps the \"serial 'pumping and dumping' of\" a myriad of tools during the last decades has - instead of sustained and continuing improvement - led to some waste of effort and resources as it did in the quality improvement domain (108). If we want to help healthcare professionals and patients with making sense of all the knowledge available to them, we should not inundate them with tools. And we need to be more vigilant about their definitions and implementation. More discipline by and collaboration between stakeholders is necessary for sustainability of the core set. The Netherlands do not have an organisation such as NICE (The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) that could take the lead in orchestrating this. Tool developers in the Netherlands are organised per healthcare domain, serving their own rank and file (e.g. The Dutch College of General Practitioners (NHG) for general practitioners, the Knowledge Institute of Medical Specialists, Akwa for mental health care, TNO for youth health care, and Vilans for long term care). Moreover, they are considered peers amongst one another. One organisation taking the lead to bind them more together regarding the (maintenance of and adherence to the) tool set, would be considered presumptuous. The National Health Care Institute could be considered, as it is an independent body, and taking its goals on quality and affordability of health care (system) into account (306). So far, the institute has been regarded with some suspicion and considered a 'bogeyman' by some parties because of unwanted interference when it comes to who is responsible for the quality of health care. The funding of these tool developing and quality improvement organisations however is being centralised at ZonMw, the Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development. For the time being separate funding programmes are still in place, but in time ZonMw - in collaboration with the parties involved - might bring them closer together in developing and maintaining tools (i.e. following the agreed rules for tools), including sticking to the established core set of tool types (307). Chapter 7 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 131DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 131 25-9-2020 00:42:2525-9-2020 00:42:25132132 Use the best of both worlds Another overarching issue is that the diff erent approaches in health care share elements. To achieve quality health care or optimal care, patient engagement is essential. Both evidence- based medicine (EBM) and shared decision-making heralded from their beginnings the formal recognition of patient engagement (26, 166, 168). Both struggle with getting evidence and patient preferences into daily practice of health care (68, 308, 309). Despite the partially equal footing and aim, EBM and SDM have been separate worlds for a long time (310-312). At the same time, because of the partially equal footing and aim, it has been argued that EBM and SDM should be brought closer together. Barratt, even though not agreeing on patient engagement as being part of EBM, made suggestions how research evidence as well as patient preferences could be combined and put into practice better. Next to funding trials that answer patients' questions better, and including patients in working groups and committees in health care, she suggested to develop tools that provide healthcare professionals and patients with answers to evidence-based questions and help them elicit and integrate patient preferences. Barratt however did not combine the tools yet, distinguishing between tool types for answering evidence based questions and other tool types to fi nd out about patient preferences and to integrate them into the decision-making (310). However, more voices to connect and combine the approaches and their tools were speaking up. Van der Weijden et al proposed strategies to adapt clinical practice guideline - the epitome of EBM - to facilitate shared decision-making (249). Acknowledging that EBM and SDM have diff erent origins - SDM emerging from law practice (313) and communication for example, and EBM from clinical epidemiology - Hoff mann et al propose to connect the two approaches as well, claiming that 'authentic EBM' as they call it, cannot occur without SDM (see fi gure 1). A strategy they suggested is to bring SDM and EBM together in clinical practice guideline development and implementation, as most CPGs still do not consider patient preferences and/or do not off er how to discuss these preferences, and talk about evidence in such a way that a patient understands it. The teaching of clinicians and students needs to be addressed as well as it focusses on critical appraisal and clinicians are not taught in depth how to integrate and apply evidence in daily practice when dealing with individual patients. They recommended combining EBM training with SDM and communications skill training (311). Chapter 7 Figure 1: The interdependence of EBM and SDM, and 'their' tools (adapted from Hoff al, 2014) DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 132DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 132 25-9-2020 00:42:2525-9-2020 00:42:25133 Hoffman et al are joined in their plea by Ubel, and Elwyn et al. The former deems that next to patient decision aids, clinical practice guidelines should be preference-sensitive so that viable choices are not taken away from patients (314). The latter expressed their appreciation for trustworthy guidelines, but preferred so called 'customized care tools', translate existing evidence into tools to help patients and clinicians work together to decide next steps (144). Not everybody is convinced though; Wennberg for example prefers patient decision aids (not derived from guidelines) to CPGs when it comes to patient informed choice as CPGs (used to) over-rely on expert judgement (35, 315). Two initiatives that can contribute to making clinical practice guidelines, in the Netherlands often called evidence-based guidelines, more patient-centred and preference-sensitive are GIN and the GRADE Working Group. The Guideline International Network (GIN) \"facilitates networking, promotes excellence and helps our members create high quality clinical practice guidelines that foster safe and effective patient care.\" (316). One way to make guidelines more patient-minded is to include patients in guideline development. The Working Group GIN Public has developed a toolbox which addresses issues such as how to include (qualitative) research on patient views in CPGs and how to recruit and support patients in guideline development (317). GRADE stands for Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation and the GRADE Working Group approaches the issue from a slightly different angle. Starting in the early 2000's, the Working Group's aim was and is addressing the shortcomings of grading systems in health care. Therefore, the Working Group has developed a transparent approach of grading quality (or certainty) of evidence and strength of recommendations. In short, when the graded evidence is of high quality (or certainty) for the main outcomes to be achieved this would lead to a so-called strong guideline recommendation. If the graded evidence is less relevant, certain, contradictory or unavailable, this would lead to a weak (or conditional) recommendation (298). Besides being transparent, the GRADE approach is also quite complex. The grading of evidence is not an easy feat, a lot of criteria must be factored in. The grading is therefore often done by guideline development methodology specialists, who are not most of the time healthcare professionals or patients (or their representatives). The approach consists of two main steps: 1/ rating the quality of evidence; 2/ determining the strength of recommendations. In step one the level of confidence is established, working with a hierarchy of evidence; randomized trials start at the top of the grading and observational studies at the bottom. The level can be downgraded or upgraded depending on certain criteria, such as: risk of bias or large effect. There is no mention of patient preferences, outcomes preferred by patients in step one. Nor clinical practice for that matter. In step two, the quality level of evidence is combined with other factors: benefits and harms, resources and cost, and patients' values and preferences. For an innocent bystander, it could seem that the other factors are not considered evidence. A bit more informed bystander could conclude that the other factors (benefits and harms; resources and costs; and patients' preferences and values could be part of the evidence but as these factors often cannot be or are not studied with RCTs their starting position in the GRADE approach could be regarded as less favourable (17). Chapter 7 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 133DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 133 25-9-2020 00:42:2525-9-2020 00:42:25134 134 In 2016, the working group introduced the Evidence to Decision framework which would support making well informed healthcare choices and formulate guideline recommendations. The article starts with \"Clinicians regularly face situations with two or more alternative actions. Each alternative often has different advantages and disadvantages, including differences in effectiveness, adverse effects, costs and other factors (criteria). To make these choices, clinicians rely on recommendations from clinical practice guidelines, other recommendations (such as from colleagues or experts) or implicit rules for decision making, such as based on their personal experience or what others do.\" (318). First, I find it is striking that patients are not mentioned; they are faced with these choices as well. Moreover, the Working Group seems to limit evidence mainly to research evidence. The presented framework is however not devoid of patient input. For example, when there is uncertainty about how much the patients value the outcomes or unpredictability in how patients value the main outcomes (meaning that patients with different values might make other decisions), they recommend formulating a weak recommendation (196, 318). However, in daily practice this often means that the language used in the recommendation is less firm, using words like 'consider'. It is not a preference- sensitive recommendation if options and patient preferences are not specified in the guideline recommendation. From that perspective, I would prefer the term 'conditional recommendation' as it indicates that the decision(s) to be made are subject to certain conditions, may that be uncertainty of the outcome or patient preferences. Another reason why I prefer the term 'conditional' to 'weak' is that to me there is a (un)conscious devaluation of the recommendation by calling it weak, when perhaps it might lead to more optimal care by being more preference- sensitive or conducive to shared decision-making. Including patient preferences or making CPGs more preference-sensitive is not easy, as was shown by Utens et al. For example, research on patient preferences is done by various domains, which is not always considered when searching for evidence and there exists a great variety in the terms and definitions that are used for preferences, which complicates searching and synthesizing evidence. Furthermore, it is unclear how to integrate such evidence, and what weight patient preferences should have in relation to other decision criteria (319-321). Montori et al made a similar observation. When suggesting together with Hoffmann to connect EBM and SDM, in another article he and others were cautious regarding clinical practice guidelines and incorporating patient preferences. One reason being that access to generalizable preferences of patients is difficult and complex. Furthermore, lack of means and expertise might hinder integrating patient preferences or lead to so-called \"tokenist patient involvement\" in guideline development. They therefore advise that guideline working groups should recognize that guideline recommendations should seldom accept uniform patient preferences and contexts in favour of a specific course of action and should embrace ambiguity more (322). Even though it might not be common practice yet, there is an increase in clinical practice guidelines that include patient preferences and/or SDM (199, 209, 278, 323). Other initiatives point in that direction as well; e.g. the DECIDE/MAGIC project that combines EBM and SDM (tools) (324, 325), as well as the Dutch 'consultkaarten' (326) in concordance with quality criteria for patient-directed tools related to CPGs (275). These examples, initiatives and the joint organisation of a conference by the International Society for Evidence-Based Health Care Chapter 7 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 134DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd (ISEHC) and International Shared (ISDM) (327) can be considered as signs that EBM and SDM, and their tools are connecting. Be inclusive, not exclusive It has been said several times already, knowledge in health care keeps accumulating and it is almost impossible to keep abreast of the research evidence in health care. Tools are being developed to help cope with the vast amount of knowledge, but these tools do not consider all knowledge sources. And as the previous section pointed out, it is not always that easy to include other sources of knowledge (patient preferences) as means are scarce and 'how to' remains elusive. The development of clinical practice guidelines has profi ted immensely from evidence-based medicine, but as was described in the introduction and by the GIN working group AID Knowledge the focus in EBM has been skewed towards research evidence (26, 308, 328) and within this body of knowledge, randomised clinical trials are the dominant type of knowledge. Attention to this imbalance has been called by others as well. Not just because relying on one knowledge source, is short-selling the other knowledge sources, but also because they are some fl aws within that particular knowledge source (28, 74). Figure 2: Research waste and 'evidence-biased' medicine (adapted from Chalmers et al, 2009; Moher et al, 2016; Burgers, 2016) Describing those fl aws in 2009, Chalmers et al made it clear that there is a 'chain of knowledge' and each link has its fl aws, leading them to conclude that there is research waste and that by relying too much on fl awed knowledge leads to 'evidence-biased' medicine (see fi gure 2). Chapter 7 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 135DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 135 25-9-2020 00:42:2625-9-2020 00:42:26136 136 In 2014, a follow-up of the review was carried out to see how the research waste could be reduced. The subsequent recommendations to reduce waste were not just aimed at researchers but also at funders, regulators, journals and academic institutions (329-333). In 2016, Moher et al tried to establish if the recommendations from 2009 and 2014 were followed through (see figure 2). They noticed some \"gratifying traction\" but concluded more effort was still needed, repeating that stakeholders should interact more (334). Greenhalgh et al (328) and two Dutch governmental advisory boards reached similar conclusions (335, 336) and made a plea to return to 'real evidence based medicine'. They were referring to the three pillars of EBM as defined by Sackett et al (26); restating that more attention needs to be paid to patient experience, the real life clinical encounter and context. Attempts are carried out to include different sources of knowledge while developing clinical practice guidelines (247, 337). And with effect; several NICE guidelines have been refocussed due to patient input (328). When Lukersmith et al tried to use different sources of knowledge developing a guideline, they experienced the difficulty in current guideline methodology to consider context and information from different sources of knowledge besides quantitative research. They therefore used the ICF (International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health framework (WHO, 2001) to manage the complexity of using different sources of knowledge (312). To achieve optimal patient care, provide more effective healthcare services and strengthen the healthcare system, the use of all knowledge sources is necessary. Not using all sources is a kind of research waste as well. I concur with Askheim et al when they said: we need to \"remodel EBM in a broader, more pluralistic, more democratic and less authoritarian manner' (338). This means making tool developers (and other stakeholders) more aware of the availability of different knowledge sources, the possible flaws within the knowledge base and that it is pertinent to continue working on methods how to appraise and include different knowledge sources. We might take our cue from other disciplines, such as environmental sciences. To make their research findings more robust and trustworthy the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) involved other sciences and worked cross-disciplinary when developing their report on climate change and food shortages (339, 340). A case of consilience If one thing has become clear to me at the end of this thesis, is that a lot of domains, disciplines, expertise, parties and professionals are involved when it comes to knowledge translation and the tools developed to support knowledge translation and (shared) decision-making. However, most of these domains, disciplines, parties and professionals currently work in their own silos of the knowledge cycle. This knowledge cycle consists of: knowledge production; knowledge synthesis; tool development; dissemination and implementation of knowledge (tools) into practice; knowledge use; and evaluation of knowledge use and impact on healthcare and patient outcomes (292, 341). In order to achieve optimal (health) care, the different parts of the knowledge cycle and their 'inhabitants' need to be well connected, so that knowledge moves more fluently into practice. It also means that all knowledge sources should be considered, and we should not restrict ourselves to knowledge sources within medicine. You could say it is a case of consilience (342). The term was coined by William Whewell in the 19th century. In his Chapter 7 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 136DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 136 25-9-2020 00:42:2625-9-2020 00:42:26137 book Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, he used it to discuss the unification of knowledge between the different branches of learning (343). I think the concept can be applied not just to knowledge but to knowledge translation and knowledge tools as well. With the unification of all the domains, disciplines, parties and professionals involved in knowledge translation and tool development, we might create a more sound and solid knowledge base, develop better tools for knowledge translation and (shared) decision-making, and improve the use of knowledge in healthcare practice. Conclusions I set out to achieve that tools are no longer developed without a clear definition, that there exists a common terminology when referring to tool types, to make better use of the different knowledge sources available, and finally provide healthcare professionals and patients, and possibly other users such as policy advisors and insurers, with a set of pragmatic tools that cover their needs in knowledge translation and decision support. It has become clear that healthcare professionals and patients are inundated with tools, but a first step to limit the number of tools and to agree on their definitions has been achieved in the Netherlands. More robust adherence is the next step and to maintain a certain level of consistency of available tool types, pseudo innovation of tool types needs to be avoided. Clarifying which purposes patient-directed knowledge tools serve and which core elements they should contain can further help tool developers, people who commission the development of these tools, patients and healthcare professionals to discern between the different tools available. It became clear that not all knowledge sources are used when developing knowledge tools, particularly clinical practical guidelines. But the disregard of knowledge sources such as more patient-driven empirical data on the patient perspective (e.g. qualitative data on patients' experiences with side-effects of treatment, with quality of care, or on patient preferences) and the main use of 'classical' doctor-driven research evidence (i.e. clinical epidemiological, quantitative research evidence) has been one of the main critiques of evidence-based medicine lately. Not just because patient preferences, clinical practice and context are still relatively underexposed, but also because the dominant knowledge source used has some flaws. Awareness of this is growing and efforts such as GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) are underway to include and appraise other knowledge sources and to address the flagged flaws in certain knowledge sources. Another way to bring the best scientific evidence and patient preferences more closely together could be achieved by connecting the evidence-based medicine approach with the approach of shared decision-making. Several strategies to achieve this have been proposed and tentative steps have been taken. One strategy concerns the training and education of healthcare professionals integrating EBM and SDM. Other strategies suggest integrating tools used in EBM and SDM or to use these tools more in concordance. Although not a straightforward method on how to integrate SDM in guidelines is available yet, more guidelines contain 'open' recommendations describing (treatment) trade-offs and (treatment) alternatives and provide more detailed guidance on how to decide with the patient on the patient's care. Another consideration is to provide tools amalgamated with specific guideline recommendations that enhance SDM, such as patient decision aids. Chapter 7 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 137DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 137 25-9-2020 00:42:2625-9-2020 00:42:26138 138 Recommendations and implications The results of this thesis may contribute to a better insight into tool development and the use of knowledge while connecting different approaches in health care which aim to improve quality of care. The recommendations and implications will be described separately for practice, research and policy. One recommendation however relates to all three: in favour of improved knowledge use the cycle of development, implementation and evaluation of knowledge tool types should be followed through. Meaning that once a tool type is developed, implementation strategies should be in place to see to the use of these tools, and after a while the implementation and use of the tools should be measured and evaluated. Then it can be decided if the tool needs changing (or dispensed with), or that the implementation strategies need adjustment, before deciding new tools should be introduced, however fancy they sound or look. Adherence to the PDCA- cycle (plan do check act), quality cycle, knowledge circle or whatever its name, is paramount to avoid wasting resources in tool development and limiting the effect of the tools in knowledge translation. Recommendations & implications for practice -To achieve a common tool terminology and avoid 'new' tool types from emerging, the core set of tool types needs to be disseminated further by the stakeholders to their rank and file. Also, the involved stakeholders should agree on next steps on how to stick to the agreed core set of tool types, implement it and evaluate and maintain it. Tool types such as clinical practice guidelines and patient decision aids have an 'expiration date'. This should also be the case with the established core set of tool types, because definitions can change as well as the needs for tools. -Furthermore, the framework of patient-directed knowledge tools should be put to the test to see whether it does help tool developers choose the right tool and helps clarify the different kinds of patient-directed tools for commissioners of tools and users. -Guideline working groups together with tool developers should be more brave and experiment with formulating recommendations that include patient preferences and/or viable treatment/care options available, to show the ambiguity of the available evidence and admit that the perception of optimal patient care is in the eye of the beholder and therefore a subjective matter. Perhaps they should invite other disciplines to the table as well, such as implementation experts, behavioural scientists, and ethicists. The Dutch College of General Practitioners is one of the few tool developers in the Netherlands to employ implementation experts and involve them when developing clinical practice guidelines. -Evidence-based medicine training should be integrated with shared decision-making and communication skills training, as the Dutch Federation of Medical Specialists is trying to do for example. However, not just for the new generation of healthcare professionals but also the older generations should receive this training. In this way, healthcare professionals are trained to use the available knowledge to their advantage whilst translating it to the patient's unique characteristics and preferences. And enabling them to discuss the patient preferences with that patient. -Chapter 7 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 138DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 138 25-9-2020 00:42:2625-9-2020 00:42:26139 Recommendations & implications for research -It needs to be acknowledged that randomized clinical trials (RCT) and other dominant frequentist methods might be excellent for answering some questions in health care (in part), such a diagnostics and therapeutic interventions, and when developing guidelines but they do not fit all knowledge needs in health care, such as complex interventions, multimorbidity, organisation of care, the gender data gap, patient preferences, public health issues (e.g. pandemics), and healthcare policy and coverage decisions; other research methods need to be considered more and the different methods need to be combined. -To enhance the further use of knowledge, and the use of all knowledge sources more effort is needed in finding out how to include and appraise other knowledge sources and how to put these methodologies to use. This might mean that evidence-based medicine needs to look at other disciplines and domains, such as psychology, (youth) social care, behavioural sciences, communication and language sciences, IT and industrial design. Not just for knowledge creation, distribution and use, but also to learn how some of these domains include and appraise different kinds of knowledge. -The importance of and need for a common terminology was shared by international experts. To get more traction on the core set of tool types, the consensus procedure could be repeated on an international level. Also, to prevent 'new' tool types entering the Netherlands Recommendations & implications for policy -Funding organisations such as ZonMw should reconsider their funding policies. They should be more open to other kinds of research methods than RCTs, stimulate research into other areas such as patient preferences, patient experiences, organisation of care, implementation studies and evaluative research and stimulate cross-disciplinary research efforts. -To make health care really patient-centred, you have to start at the beginning by saving a proper seat for patients at the table that sets the research agenda. The Dutch Research Agenda (Nationale Wetenschapsagenda) was a promising first step. Though, I am curious how (well) it plays out for the questions submitted by patients and the general public. Increased funding of patient participation in knowledge translation and tool development, or broader to enable actual patient emancipation and become an equal partner, could be considered. Perhaps healthcare insurers could assume some kind of responsibility in putting patients more centre stage. -It is becoming increasingly clear that (medical) decision-making is not merely an objective and rational process, nor free from intrusion of emotions and behavioural and cognitive biases, whether it concerns patients, healthcare professionals or other stakeholders. We need to acknowledge that and deal with it (better). The Dutch government should follow up on the reports of the Netherlands Scientific Council for Government Policy (Wetenschappelijke Raad voor de Regering) on the psychology of deciding, choice and behaviour explaining the complex and sometimes erratic dynamics of human choice behaviour; for example in healthcare covering subjects such as limited rationality, unstable preferences, habits, and influences by the social and physical environment (344, 345), and see to it that it permeates to healthcare practice and research.Chapter 7 DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 139DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 139 25-9-2020 functioning, order Council for the Quality of Care), MC-U-2927498 (2009). 5.

Land 00:42:2925-9-2020 00:42:29161 Summary The body of knowledge in health care is vast and accumulating daily. To help healthcare professionals and patients handle and use this wealth of knowledge (something also dubbed 'information overload') when deciding about the patient's care, so-called knowledge tools are developed. The aims of this thesis were firstly, tool types are no longer developed without a clear definition and use. Secondly, there exists a common terminology when referring to tool types. Thirdly, to make better use of the different knowledge sources available, and finally provide healthcare professionals and patients, and possibly other users such as policy advisors and insurers, with a set of pragmatic tools that cover their needs in knowledge translation and decision support. This resulted in the following research questions: -What tool types to translate knowledge and support (shared) decision-making are available to healthcare professionals (and patients) in the Netherlands? (Chapter 2) -How are these tool types defined and does consensus exist on the definitions across the healthcare domains in the Netherlands? (Chapters 2 and 3) -Which criteria do these tool types need to meet and which purposes do they serve so that healthcare professionals and patients consider them trustworthy and useful? (Chapter 4) -Do we consider all knowledge sources when developing tools, and what does that mean for tool development? (Chapter 5) -What are healthcare professionals' needs using tools for knowledge translation and shared decision-making? (Chapter 6) Available tool types There exist different kinds of tool types that support knowledge translation and/or (shared) decision making. A scoping review among national organisations that develop and implement tools yielded 67 different tool types in the Netherlands. Of these tool types, many were ill- defined; meaning that there was no definition of the tool type (readily) available or the definition was (partially) incomplete: it contained no description of the tool type, its goal, and/nor who their intended target users were. In the pursuit of curtailing the information overload, we might have created an overload of tools and by ill defining them partially nullified the strived for use of knowledge and achieving optimal patient care. Defining tool types Therefore, a consensus procedure to limit the amount of tool types and to agree on the definition of the tool types was carried out at a national level in the Netherlands. Stakeholders from various domains in health care (curative care, long term care and public health) and with different expertise participated; patients, tool developers, healthcare professionals, policy advisors. In the end, consensus was reached on a core set of nine tool types and there was agreement on the definitions of five of these tools. These were: 'summary', 'flowchart', 'clinical practice guideline', 'protocol' and 'patient decision Despite the participation of the stakeholders and some organisations already adopting the core set, the reached consensus was just a first step. It remains a challenge to adhere to the core set. A more concerted effort by the parties involved is needed. But also, because new tool types or seemingly new tool types Summary DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 161DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 161 25-9-2020 00:42:2925-9-2020 00:42:29162 162 (pseudo innovation) keep emerging. Possibly illustrating that something new is more alluring and exciting than tinkering with and adhering to existing tool types. However, for change and implementation to take effect, a certain constancy of purpose and consistency is needed. Purposes and criteria of tool types Believing the issue of too many tool types available to healthcare professionals and patients, was not confined to the Netherlands, international experts were approached to participate in a two-day evidence-informed consensus meeting. The aim of this invitational meeting was to develop a conceptual framework categorizing the different tool types aimed directly at patients. The participants considered a framework including all tool types infeasible during a two-day meeting. The developed framework clarifies the purposes of the patient-directed tool types and indicates the core elements these tool types prototypically consist of. In this way, the framework can help tool developers, people who commission the development of these tools, patients and healthcare professionals to discern between the different tools, and to identify to which tool type it belongs, which purposes it serves and which core elements it should contain. As the framework was developed by a small group of experts, it is called a conceptual or working framework and it needs to be further tested and probed to check if it is usable and to make it more robust. Knowledge sources and tool types Besides having a closer look at the various tool types that convey knowledge, knowledge itself was looked at as well, as part of the work done by the G-I-N Working Group Appraising and Including Different (AID) Knowledge. Different knowledge sources exist but some seem to be favoured more than others. Evidence-based guidelines are supposed to search for, and explicitly consider, evidence from sources other than conventional clinical trials and their quantitative data. These different types of knowledge can be used and are needed in situations when for example evidence from RCTs is unavailable, impossible to obtain, contradictory or inappropriate. These sources can also be used in conjunction with RCTs to provide context, to assess relevance and to understand bias(es). Additionally, more complex forms of knowledge like experiential and contextual knowledge can help guideline developers to take an approach consistent with the intentions of early evidence-based medicine: the best evidence is not restricted to evidence from RCTs and meta-analyses. However, in the context of medicine and guideline production, integrating different types of knowledge continues to be underexplored and undertheorized. Paediatricians' reflections on tool types The worlds 'evidence-based medicine', 'shared decision-making' and 'tools' can come up with a lot of ideas, theories and concepts of how to move knowledge into use in daily practice but how do healthcare professionals feel about these endeavours. In interviews, 15 paediatricians reflected on several strategies to enhance shared decision-making (SDM) in paediatric palliative care. The first one being the clinical practice guideline Palliative care for children that contains recommendations on shared decision-making. The other strategies were a modified guideline recommendation on pain relief to reflect available options and patient preferences, and patient decision aids. Not all paediatricians felt that guidelines could enhance SDM as they regarded Summary DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 162DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 162 25-9-2020 00:42:2925-9-2020 00:42:29163 it a skill or attitude. Others, however, thought that guidelines in general could enhance shared decision-making in daily practice. In the case of the guideline Palliative care for children, however, they commented that the recommendations needed to focus more on how to practice SDM. When presented with a one option recommendation on pain relief and a multiple options recommendation on pain relief, most paediatricians preferred the latter, as it would open the discussion with the patient and/or its parents. Furthermore, most interviewed paediatricians felt that patient decisions aids were beneficial to patients, e.g. to ensure that all topics relevant to the patient are covered. For guidelines to enhance SDM, guideline developers could consider formulating more 'open' recommendations, especially in case of preference sensitive choices. Moreover, SDM should not be limited to non-treatment recommendations, should describe (treatment) trade-offs and (treatment) alternatives and provide more detailed guidance. Another consideration is to provide tools amalgamated with specific guideline recommendations to enhance shared decision-making, such as patient decision aids. A case of consilience Taking a step back and looking at the research findings some overarching issues could be discerned. If we want to help healthcare professionals and patients with making sense of all the knowledge and knowledge sources available to them, we should not inundate them with tools. And we need to be more vigilant about their definitions and implementation. More discipline by and collaboration between stakeholders is necessary for sustainability of the core set that was agreed on a national level. Furthermore, we need to combine and connect the EBM and SDM approaches to integrate research evidence and patient preferences better. That means developing tools that provide healthcare professionals and patients with answers to evidence-based questions and help them elicit and integrate patient preferences. Next to patient decision aids, clinical practice guidelines should be more preference-sensitive so that viable choices are not taken away from patients. To achieve optimal patient care, provide more effective healthcare services and strengthen the healthcare system, the use of all knowledge sources is necessary. Not using all sources is a waste of research as well. This means making tool developers (and other stakeholders) more aware of the availability of different knowledge sources, the possible flaws within the predominantly used knowledge base and that it is pertinent to continue working on methods how to appraise and include different knowledge sources. To achieve all this an interdisciplinary and interprofessional approach is needed. The many domains, disciplines, expertise, parties and professionals involved in knowledge translation, (shared) decision-making and tool development should abandon their silos, combine their knowledge, compare methods. In addition, the different domains in health care such as cure, social care, occupational health, public health and long term care, could collaborate more frequently and learn from each other. And they might even look outside health care for other knowledge sources and how these other domains appraise and include the array of knowledge sources available. Getting knowledge used in daily practice is a case of consilience. The policy domain is a part of this as well and could contribute (more) by acknowledging that patients Summary DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 163DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 163 25-9-2020 00:42:2925-9-2020 00:42:29164 164 need to be better positioned, by having governmental agencies fund a more diverse palette of studies such as research on patient preferences and implementation, and by following up on governmental reports that looked into the psychology of deciding, choice and behaviour and how this affects the decision-making in healthcare practice. Strengths and limitations No thesis can go without a critical reflection on the used research methods. This thesis consists of predominant qualitative research as the research was exploratory in nature. First, it tried to achieve an improved understanding of perspectives, experiences, opinions, attitudes concerning translation of knowledge. Second, it looked into the use of knowledge tool types. Third, the comprehension of the needs of healthcare professionals was examined when using these tool types. And last, it tried to reach consensus on (developing) criteria and purposes of these tool types. Strengths and limitations of qualitative research relate to credibility, transferability and dependability. To increase credibility several approaches were used, such as involving participants as much as possible by sharing results and outcomes and by member checking and independent coding by three authors. Transferability is regarded as limited, mainly because the research was largely executed with tool types used in the Netherlands and a Dutch clinical practice guideline. However, methods and outcomes can be used in international settings and other guidelines as well. Qualitative research is characterised by fluid structures, which change because of incoming and available data. Therefore, to improve dependability, for each study the approach and/or method chosen and the changes therein, if any, were exhaustively described. Furthermore, the SRQR or COREQ checklists were applied for all the studies in this thesis, except chapter five. Conclusion It has become clear that healthcare professionals and patients are inundated with (loosely defined) tools. A first step to limit the number of tool types and agree on their definitions has been achieved in the Netherlands. The next step is more robust adherence to maintain a certain level of consistency of the available tool types. Pseudo innovation of tool types needs to be avoided. Furthermore, the current knowledge tools do not always use all the knowledge sources that are available. Awareness of this is growing and efforts are underway to include and appraise these other knowledge sources. Different approaches in health care, such as SDM and EBM, exist to achieve optimal patient care. These approaches should combine their efforts more. Strategies to achieve this have been proposed and tentative steps have been taken. One strategy suggests integrating tools used in EBM and SDM or to use these tools more in concordance. Further recommendations for practice, policy and further research are described in detail at the end of the general discussion.Summary De doelstellingen Wat vaak ontbrak de inperking van verleiden - tot het zich committeren aan en beperken instrumenten meer die verder blik werpen in de beleidsdomein over criteria en doelen van dit instrumentarium. en te laten controleren, plus een onafhankelijke criteria for patient-centred knowledge tools related to clinical practice guidelines. A development and consensus studyValorisation chapter Trudy van der Background Patient-directed knowledge tools such as patient versions of guidelines and patient decision aids are increasingly developed to facilitate shared decision-making. In this paper, we report how consensus was reached within the Netherlands on quality criteria for development, content and governance of these tools Method A 12-month development and consensus study. The consortium worked on four work packages: 1/ reviewing existing criteria; 2/ drafting the quality criteria; 3/ safe-guarding the acceptability and feasibility of the draft criteria by participatory research in ongoing tool development projects; and 4/ gaining formal support from national stakeholders on the quality criteria. Results We reached consensus on an 8-step guidance; describing minimal quality criteria for 1/ the team composition, 2/ setting the scope, 3/ identifying needs, 4/ the content and format, 5/ testing the draft, 6/ finalising and approval, 7/ dissemination and application, and 8/ ownership and revision. The participants of the ongoing tool development projects were positive about the quality criteria in general, but divided as to the degree of detail. Whereas some expressed a clear desire for procedural standards, others felt that it would be sufficient to provide only general directions. Despite the different views as to the degree of detail, consensus was reached in three stakeholder meetings. Discussion We successfully collaborated with all stakeholders and achieved formal support from national stakeholders on a set of minimum criteria for the development process, content and governance of patient-directed knowledge tools.

The development of knowledge tools is intended to support clinicians to keep pace and to improve their decision-making. Many knowledge tools such as clinical practice guidelines, protocols, or clinical pathways have been developed over the years2. With the increasing call for a patient revolution3, further tool types have been added to the mix, including patient decision aids. A key source of information for patient-directed knowledge tools is clinical practice guidelines. Clinical practice guidelines summarize research evidence systematically and provide recommendations on a specific clinical topic4. Nowadays, the GRADE approach is used as a framework to rate the quality of the evidence, and to assess the strength of the recommendations taking into account the balance between benefits and harms, resource use, and feasibility considerations. The GRADE method also recognises the collective patient perspectives5; the strength of the recommendations is also affected by the patients' appreciation of advantages and level of acceptability of disadvantages of the intervention, such as side effects and treatment burden. Worldwide, patients and patient representatives increasingly take part in the development of guideline recommendations6. Next to patient participation on a collective level, efforts are made to adapt or enrich guidelines so as to facilitate patient participation on an individual level, in clinical decision-making7. Patient participation is especially important in case of preference-sensitive decisions where multiple options exist, or where the benefits and harms of the intervention may be assigned a different weight by different patients8. Illustrative examples to facilitate patient participation in clinical decision-making are patient versions of a guideline such as a lay summary, or patient decision aids for specific preference-sensitive decisions attached to the guideline document. Some guidance for content of lay summaries of guidelines is provided by the Guidelines International Network9. In 2006, standards were formulated for the content of patient decision aids by the International Patient Decision Aids Standards (IPDAS) group, a multi-stakeholder process that led to a self-assessment checklist10. Further work led to a measure IPDASi11 and a set of criteria that should be met to achieve a 'minimum' acceptable standard12. Guideline developers are experimenting to derive the information for patient decision aids - evidence on benefits and harms of interventions and on patient considerations and patient preferences - directly from the guideline13. Much is also happening with respect to the development of patient-centred knowledge tools such as patient versions of a guideline or patient decision aids in the Netherlands, on various sides of the care equation14. Patient organisations are gaining a more accurate picture of the information needs that these tools must satisfy. Professional and scientific associations feel a responsibility to ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of medical information supplied via such tools. Web and tool designers continue to introduce ever more user-interface friendly tools. For this study, we used the following definition: a patient-directed knowledge tool synthesizes and distils the highest quality knowledge and research, is aimed directly at the patient (and next of kin), with the goal to engage patients in dialogue or deliberation during a clinical encounter, Valorisation chapter DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 173DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 173 25-9-2020 00:42:3125-9-2020 00:42:31174 174 or to support and/or improve patient decision making which may or may not take place during a clinical encounter15. Yet these patient-centred knowledge tools are subject to a multitude of varying definitions and criteria, especially regarding the patient versions of guidelines, and the development process16-22. As a result, it is difficult for parties to distinguish what is truly important from what is not, or what type of patient-directed knowledge tool is in fact the correct means to achieve the stated purpose. In addition to quality criteria, the need for national governance is also felt strongly, as many initiatives by patient organisations and professional bodies to develop patient-directed knowledge tools exist side by side. This situation has resulted in an uncoordinated, partly overlapping mixture of publicly and privately/commercially available patient decision aids23. Moreover, some of the patient decision aids do not seem to follow the rigid and multi-stakeholder methods to review the evidence base, as is common in clinical practice guidelines. A guidance for the development of reliable patient versions of guidelines and patient decision aids can serve to integrate all existing knowledge and previously developed expertise, allowing the stakeholders to work together more effectively and more efficiently. The purpose of such a guidance is to promote the development of high-quality, reliable and publicly available patient- directed knowledge tools, which will contribute to achieving properly informed patients and shared decision-making. Initiated by the National Health Care Institute of the Netherlands, a consortium of healthcare stakeholders started to develop such guidance , supported by academic researchers. Apart from validity, feasibility was important given the conflict between the aim of high-quality knowledge tools and the limited resources to develop such tools. The purpose of this article is twofold. First, we describe the methods used for arriving at the guidance as an illustrative example of how formal support from national stakeholders can be reached. Second, we present the list (guidance ) of minimum quality criteria for the development, content and governance of patient information on guidelines and patient decision aids, as well as the way in which these tools can be connected to the clinical practice guidelines. Methods The National Health Care Institute of the Netherlands initiated and granted this 12-month development study, that was composed of a literature review, a feasibility check, and a consensus procedure. We took the position that we needed various types of input and processes to ensure a successful consensus process. To this end, we designed a consortium (see first four authors and last two authors) that worked together continuously in an iterative process using cross-fertilisation, without being hindered by hierarchy. A representative of the Dutch Federation of Patients' Organisations (last author) was co-leading the project with the first author. In a 12-month project that started in October 2015, we worked on the basis of four work packages (WPs): WP1/ Radboud University (MF) reviewed existing criteria in the literature, synthesising evidence and best practices; WP2/ Maastricht University (TvdW, DD), the coordinating 00:42:31175 the acceptability and feasibility of the draft criteria by gathering experiences with the draft guidance from knowledge tool developers; WP4/ the Dutch Federation of Patients' Organisations (AK) organised the consensus procedure aiming to support the guidance by national stakeholders. Work package 1 We searched for formal criteria and methodologies in the scientific literature, in policy reports, and on websites by developers of guidelines and patient decision aids. The search strings that we used to explore PubMed are described in Table 1, as are the websites to search for the grey literature. This inventory supplied the basis for the first draft of the guidance. One of the researchers of WP1 made a first selection of the search based on title and abstract, and excluded references clearly not fulfilling the inclusion criteria. All full-text versions that resulted from this first selection were downloaded and assessed along the pre-set in- and exclusion criteria. In case of doubt a second researcher was consulted to reach consensus on in- or exclusion. Inclusion criteria for literature on patient versions of guidelines: -The paper describes the development process of a patient version or lay summary of a clinical practice guideline. -Explicit description of the methods used (be it short or extensive) for development. -English or Dutch language. Exclusion criteria: -Papers describing only the process of patient participation in development of a clinical practice guideline. Inclusion criteria for literature on patient decision aids: -The title reports the term 'development' or 'design'. -The abstract reports the development of a patient decision aid as the aim of the paper. -Description of development process of disease specific or generic decision aids. -Explicit description of the methods used (be it short or extensive) for development. -English or Dutch language. Exclusion criteria: -Papers describing development of tools that stretch further than patient decision aids (e.g. social support, self-management). -Papers describing development of tools on other decisions than medical decisions.Valorisation chapter DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 175DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 175 25-9-2020 00:42:3125-9-2020 00:42:31176 176 Table 1: Search strings used to explore Pubmed, and websites used to search for grey literature Search strings Patient information based on guidelines -(((method*[Title/Abstract] OR approach*[Title/Abstract] OR framework[Title/Abstract] OR develop*[Title/Abstract] OR Care\"[Mesh])) Websites -Dutch Knowledge Institute of Medical Specialists -Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organisation -Guidelines International Network, Patient and Public Involvement working group -UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (NHMRC) -USA Oncoline Kaiser -USA Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) -Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (CTFPHC) -IPDAS working Group www.ipdas.ohri.ca -Patient Decision Aids Research Group https://decisionaid.ohri.ca -The Preference Laboratory http://optiongrid.org/option-grids/about-the-grids -Mayo Clinic for shared decision making http://shareddecisions.mayoclinic.org -DECIDE research Group www.decide-collaboration.eu -Joanna Briggs Institute University of Adelaide http://joannabriggs.org Work package 2 The project was coordinated via monthly meetings with all WP leaders, complemented by numerous one-to-one contacts. We used definitions of the patient-directed knowledge tools that were recently formulated in another Dutch national consensus procedure; see Box24-25. The findings from the literature review were used to draft the first set of the minimal quality criteria for development, content and governance of patient-directed knowledge tools. The findings of the feasibility checks (WP3) and consensus meetings (WP4) were used to write the second and third draft of the guidance. Box 1: The Dutch definitions of the patient-directed knowledge tools.24-25 Patient information based on a guideline (= patient version of a guideline): Explanation of a specific condition or (health) care issue based on a guideline; made available to patients and their next of kin; provides information on available care choices and the care that they can expect from the care process.

Patient decision aid (PDA): Auxiliary information and answers to frequently asked questions for patients when choosing, with their care providers, from different options - including the option to forgo care - in a specific area such as diagnostics, treatment, screening, counselling or aftercare; discusses the possible outcomes and effects of each option - desirable or otherwise - and their likelihood of occurring; helps patients to weigh up their options based on their own values, standards and personal circumstances. Work package 3 The first and second draft guidance was presented for a critical assessment of its feasibility to the project leaders of nine working groups tasked with the development of patient versions of guidelines or patient decision aids along clinical practice guidelines. These working groups were at that time in various phases of their development projects. Five projects focused on developing patient information based on guidelines, e.g. for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Four projects focused on developing patient decision aids for specific recommendations, e.g. in the care for orthopaedic patients. For the third draft of the guidance we did not only seek for critical assessment by the project leader, but we also asked the project leader to actually apply (part of) the guidance steps in their working groups and to report about their experiences. Four of these nine ongoing projects were further analysed by means of outreach visits and participatory observations of working group meetings. Finally, the last draft and the experiences were fed back to each project leader in individual semi-structured qualitative interviews. The interviews were audiotaped, transcribed and analysed with thematic content analysis26. Work package 4 The draft versions of the guidance were discussed in three invitational meetings. We purposefully sampled the participants for the first two meetings to guarantee continuity in the process by inviting a core group for both meetings. While we planned the input from academic experts in the first meeting, the profile of participants gradually shifted to stakeholders representing end-users only in the last meeting. First, a two-hour expert meeting was held in March 2016 aimed at collecting the experts' suggestions, for which 43 stakeholders representing patients, care providers, researchers, web and tool designers and healthcare insurers were invited. Second, a two-hour meeting was held in June 2016, for which 29 stakeholders representing patients, care providers, knowledge institutions, healthcare insurers and the government were invited to question their support to the draft version of the guidance. Third and finally, a 90-minute consensus meeting was held in September 2016, for which only the formal representatives of patients, healthcare providers and healthcare insurers were invited in order to gain formal support.

WP1 Inventory of existing methods and criteria in scientific and grey literature We found 51 hits in PubMed, of which four studies were included that describe criteria for developing patient versions of guidelines. The grey literature revealed many websites publishing patient versions of guidelines, but information on how these knowledge tools were developed was scarce. Detailed descriptions were found, however, in the Guidelines International Network 'GIN Public toolkit on patient and public involvement in guidelines'. For developing patient decision aids, we found 385 hits in PubMed, of which 24 studies were included; 10 more relevant publications were added by the experts in the project group. In addition, the websites revealed rich data on what exactly patient decision aids are and how they should be developed. The criteria for the content of patient decision aids were mostly based on empirical data26, while such data were more or less absent for the content of patient versions of guidelines. IPDAS criteria (ipdas.ohri.ca) enjoy broad support where criteria for the content of decision aids are concerned, due to their substantiation by means of systematic consensus methodology. WP3 Feasibility assessment in ongoing development projects While reactions to the ordering of the development steps in the draft guidance were unanimously positive, the project leaders were extremely divided as to the degree of detail when it came to the instructions within the steps of the guidance, such as how best to map the patient perspective in the scoping and needs assessment phase. Whereas some project leaders expressed a clear desire for procedural standards ( it should be clear at all times who does what and when ), others felt that it would be sufficient for the instructions in each step to provide only general direction. Concerning the other issues raised, we report those most frequently mentioned: -Deviating from the linear ordering of the guidance should be possible. For example, the guideline working group may be no longer active, while the patient-directed tool is urgently needed. -Language and jargon used in the guidance was often found to be too academic. -The amount and complexity of the work to map the patients' perspective in the scoping and needs assessment phase, e.g. by organising a focus group or a questionnaire survey, was often underestimated. Due to limitations in resources and the high workload, work should not be done twice, in the guideline working group and in the patient tool development group. Moreover, the required minimum number of two patients in the team - as was prescribed in the earlier drafts - was a concern, as well as the mandatory inclusion of a representative of the guideline working group. -Formal authorisation of the tool was not regarded necessary by all stakeholders, with the argument that the guideline was already approved. -All project leaders plead for a central portal to host the patient directed knowledge tools, supported by a national party taking care of the governance of the tools.Valorisation chapter DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 178DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 178 25-9-2020 00:42:3125-9-2020 00:42:31179 WP4 The consensus meetings For the first meeting, 28 out of 43 invited experts were present. When asked to mark the most important sections of the guidance, experts prioritised the following issues: chose the right type of knowledge tool for the aim it pursues; use the guideline (recommendation) itself as the most important source of information for the knowledge tool; determine who will become the owner of the knowledge tool; make the knowledge tool easily accessible and free to use; organize authorization by the healthcare professional organization(s) as well as the patients' organization(s). For the second meeting 21 out of 29 invited were present. All stakeholders were well represented. In general, they expressed a positive attitude towards the guidance although two critical remarks were made. Firstly, multiple stakeholders emphasized to widen the scope of the guidance so that patient-directed knowledge tools can also be developed on topics that are not covered by clinical practice guidelines; especially patient organizations claimed that the information needs of patients should determine the content of patient-directed knowledge tools, as opposed to only following the existing guideline recommendations. Secondly, the nursing organisation criticized the language of the guidance being too scientific and loaded with too much medical jargon. The third meeting was attended by formal representatives of all parties except for the Dutch Association of Insurers, which formally declined while giving blind consent to the guidance as a token of trust in the representatives of the patients and providers. Therefore, the final meeting was attended by four participants, representing the Dutch Federation of Patients' Organisations (HP), the Dutch College of General Practitioners (TD), the Dutch Association of Medical Specialists (IM), and the Dutch Nurses' Association (SK). They expressed their positive intentions with regard to supporting the guidance, but only after the following issues were clarified: the minimum criteria should clearly be listed separate from the additional suggestions; developers of patient-directed knowledge tools should be encouraged to use the guidance according to the comply or explain principle; authorization of patient-related knowledge tools should be done on a process level and not on the level of authorizing the content of the tools, as content was already authorized in the final phase of the guideline development process. In retrospect, it can be observed that the quest for clear and outspoken procedural standards that was verbalised by some project leaders in WP3 was strongly echoed in the first meeting but that it faded away in the second meeting, while only crude instructions for each step were regarded sufficient in the third and final meeting. The guidance WP1 provided rich data for formulating eight distinct development steps in the guidance (Table 2). The final guidance consists of three components: a) recommendations for which type of knowledge tool (such as a lay summary or decision aid) best fits the objectives of the development group; b) minimum criteria for the eight development steps, content and governance of each tool (Box 2); c) supplemental, detailed and concrete suggestions for each step in a second layer of information (14 pages in total, not presented, available on request). Developers deviating from these minimum criteria would have to provide a rationale for why a criterion does not apply ('comply or explain'). The steps need not always be followed in linear fashion, as the guidance establishes the criteria for an effective development process rather Valorisation chapter DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 179DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 179 25-9-2020 00:42:3125-9-2020 00:42:31180 180 than laying out a strictly prescribed series of ordered steps. In the event that the development of the knowledge tool (patient information on a guideline or a patient decision aid based on a specific guideline recommendation) is part of a guideline project, the development team will ideally be commissioned by the guideline working group itself.

Rather than assuming just one guideline as a starting point, this situation might mean that multiple guidelines will need to be integrated and translated into a single patient information document, as this process will more effectively address the desires and perceptions of the target group. Or, alternatively, it might mean that only a limited number of guideline modules will be applied in creating patient information documents. A need to develop one or more patient decision aids is especially indicated when one or more of the guideline's key recommendations are preference-sensitive in nature.Valorisation chapter DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 180DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 180 25-9-2020 00:42:3225-9-2020 00:42:32181 Box 2: The guidance. A brief description of each step for the development of patient information on a guideline or a patient decision aid (PDA) connected to specific guideline recommendation(s). 1 TEAM The team composition is discussed with the relevant patients' and professional associations. The team has an independent chair and a process support member/secretary, along with at least one patient (-representative) with first-hand experience (acquired by the patients' organisation). Membership of the team is approved based on written Declarations of Interests. An editor with experience in writing copy for a non-expert audience will be involved in the team. If the development of the tool is part of a guideline project, the team will (ideally) be commissioned by the guideline working group itself, which has budgeted the developmental work. 2 SCOPE The team checks the availability of existing tools, and establishes the objective, the target group and the rough form of the tool. Patient information: Determine where the guideline is failing to meet patients' information needs. After all, guidelines for practice are typically drawn up from the perspective of the care provider. Whenever possible, address the major underlying questions patients have about the guideline, as well as the key recommendations. PDA: Select one or more recommendations from the guideline that have to do with the decision at hand, and that are preference- sensitive in nature. 3 NEEDS There are multiple ways to identify the needs of patients: a review of the literature, and/or additional qualitative or quantitative methodologies for collecting data, such as focus groups or questionnaires. Patient information: Concerns any additional needs that have not yet been elaborated during the guideline development, e.g. with regard to multimorbidity, ethnic minorities, alternative interventions, self- management. PDA: Involves questions the patients and their proxies may have when faced with taking a specific decision. Which needs, preferences and attributes influence a given patient's decision-making? This might involve information needs and psychosocial needs, along with important strategies for self-management in connection with the illness or condition, and should also include the variations between patients.Valorisation chapter DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 181DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 181 25-9-2020 00:42:3225-9-2020 00:42:32182 182 4 CONTENT For both type of tools describe: - The target group and medical condition/symptom/healthcare topic. - The guideline(s) serving as the basis (in part) for the creation of the information on evidence, etc. - The source of funding, who has ownership, year of publication and expiry date (if applicable). - The interests of each member of the development group (conflict of interest). Patient information: Describe the guideline recommendations on which patients would want to be informed in terms that a layperson can understand. Mention frequently-used examples of professional jargon so that patients can become familiar with them. The patient information will additionally indicate the following aspects: - Point out where aspects have consciously been omitted and/or emphasis has intentionally shifted (if applicable), as compared to the guideline. PDA: Describe the situation/decision at hand and the relevant recommendation(s) from the guideline, in terms that a layperson would understand. The PDA will describe the following aspects (at minimum): - An explanation that the patient has a choice; that he/she is facing a preference-sensitive decision. - A description of the medical/care options, including the option to wait and see (if applicable) and an explanation of the procedure for each medical/care intervention. - The desired and undesired outcomes (side effects) of the medical or care options, and the burden of treatment. - The likelihood and risks of the outcomes, expressed as numeric data with equal denominator of population in natural frequencies and an identical length of time; preferably displayed in population diagrams; framed both positively and negatively (chances of both survival and fatality, for example); and in the case of risk reduction presented, at minimum, in terms of absolute (and potentially relative) risk reduction. - An evidence table in which the medical/care options are summarised and compared in terms of a few key aspects. - Ensure explicit mention of the attributes found in step 3 that are important for patients to keep in mind as they consider their options and elicit their values. These attributes must contribute to the key aspects described in the evidence table.Valorisation chapter DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 182DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 182 25-9-2020 00:42:3225-9-2020 00:42:32183 5 TEST The development team will present the draft to the relevant professional, scientific and patients' associations for the purpose of obtaining feedback. The parties will assess whether the patient perspective is sufficiently reflected, ensure understanding of people with low literacy, and if the medical content is accurate. If the guideline working group is still active, the draft will be presented to that group for feedback as well. 6 FINALISING The development team establishes the final knowledge tool and presents it to the relevant professional, scientific and patients' associations for approval. This regards approval at the process level, i.e. concerning the creation of the knowledge tool. Ownership is determined and formally established. 7 DISSEMINATION The tool will ideally be submitted to the national Health Care Institute as a section of the relevant guideline(s). The knowledge tool becomes accessible to the public and is preferably made available at a central location, including points for attention to facilitate the actual application/implementation in healthcare practice. 8 OWNERSHIP The owner(s) of the knowledge tool will manage the tool and determine when the information is due to be revised: in any case when the expiry date has been reached. Ideally, the need for revision of the tool will be considered when the guideline as a whole is revised. Discussion We successfully collaborated as a consortium of researchers and end user representatives, with patient participation realised at the highest level of involvement, to achieve formal support from national stakeholders on a set of minimum criteria for the development process, content and governance of patient-directed knowledge tools related to clinical practice guidelines. What we provide is not a detailed 'recipe' for development but rather a series of recommendations based on the 'state of the art' and feasibility considerations. A number of potential limitations should be mentioned. Our project was explicitly embedded in the guideline context, we did e.g. not include patient versions of systematic reviews. The guideline context may be a limiting context for developing patient-directed knowledge tools. As the starting point of a clinical practice guideline is predominantly the clinicians' perspective, important issues for patients may not be covered in the guideline. The assignment from the National Health Care Institute was aimed specifically at guidelines in the context of curative health care. While the literature is unclear in this regard, it is possible that the content of the guidance might have been different had representatives from public health, long-term and palliative healthcare been included. One strength of this project is the systematic approach Valorisation chapter DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 183DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 183 25-9-2020 00:42:3225-9-2020 00:42:32184 184 and involvement of all national stakeholders, from patients to policymakers, with patient representatives in a co-leading role. We believe that the involvement of all stakeholders from the writing phase of the project proposal contributed to the successful collaboration. Another strength of the project is that the guidance was developed with prospective feasibility checks parallel to the nine ongoing development projects. The relevance of patient-directed knowledge tools being publicly available has also been acknowledged in the UK, with one of the main institutions developing guidelines committed to develop patient decision aids based on clinical guidelines28. The relevance of this process was recently underpinned by empirical evidence in the Netherlands. The Dutch College of General Practitioners launched a non-commercial public website in March 2012 that provides easy access to patient versions of guidelines. Since its launch, the website has grown to become one of the most visited Dutch healthcare websites. Healthcare usage in primary care seems to have decreased by 12% after the launch of the website29. We expect the criteria to evolve over time as they are further tested through developers using patient versions of guidelines and patient decision aids, as well as by adding new tools to the guidance. The next challenge will be the effective implementation of the guidance as a further step towards ensuring the development of high-quality, reliable and publicly available patient- directed knowledge tools with the support and acceptance of professional associations (and alliances), scientific associations and patients' organisations. The main stakeholders (the Dutch Federation of Patients' Organisations, the Dutch Association of Medical Specialists, the Dutch College of General Practitioners and the Dutch Nurses' Association) continued in working together to translate the guidance into a web-based practical version, and to arrive at consensus on a sustainable model for the development, publication, governance and financing of patient decision aids. An important follow-up step is to crosslink this guidance to the guidance for developers of clinical practice guidelines1. Formal steps towards accreditation have not been taken yet, the question being whether this procedure is needed, and is warranted given the current level of evidence. In December 2016, the USA National Quality Forum released national standards for the certification of patient decision aids30. The certification criteria are meant to be used for 'complete' patient decision aids, which are standalone, independent tools for patients facing a clinical decision. Our guidance, although not formulated along the lines of certification criteria, is highly comparable with the USA criteria in terms of content. The only USA criterion that we do not cover is that the patient decision aid should report readability levels. We believe that this study can be seen as an inspirational example for other countries that are facing the same challenges with regard to the development and governance of clinician- and patient-directed knowledge tools such as guidelines, guideline summaries, patient versions of guidelines and patient decision aids.Valorisation chapter DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 184DunjaDreesens_binnenwerk_def_aangepast.indd 184 25-9-2020 00:42:3225-9-2020 00:42:32185 References 1.

I love you to the author Born in Maastricht on 9th February 1972, the last day of carnival. And every eleven years, my birthday takes place on the last day of carnival. Carnival enthusiasts recognise the significance. I grew up in Maastricht except for a five year stint in Born and Sittard ('t Kleesj). After finishing Gymnasium \u00df at 't Stedelijk, I chose to start with the brand-new studies Commerce and Business Economics at Hogeschool Zuyd (1994). Because on the one hand I was dreading the 'crowdedness' of university, and on the other hand this new study offered the opportunity to spend a year abroad. During that year abroad, I did an apprenticeship at Douwe Egberts UK (London) and got introduced to techniques retailers use to influence buying behaviour of customers. Which was also the subject of my thesis. Triggered by the course 'intercultural communications', I decided to follow-up with a master study that was more human interest oriented: social cultural sciences at Vrije University in Amsterdam (1998). During my last year at university, I got employed by Boots the Chemist Ltd. A pharmacy/chemist chain that was seeking a foothold in continental Europe. As Merchandising & Marketing executive health care, this was my introduction in the world of (commercial) health care. After opening five shops in the Netherlands, I switched to the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports where I was involved in the project pharmaceutical care. Still not having found my niche, I left the government after two years to start as a consultant with Accenture (2000). That was a rollercoaster ride, peeking into kitchens of very different organisations such as AkzoNobel, KLM, Child Welfare Council, Betuweroute (knowing quit early on that its deadline would not be met) and spending most my time with energy supplier Essent (regarding transition of the energy market). My project involvements were mainly change management. After five years, I decided it was time to return to health care as I wanted to make sure it is in tip top shape when I'm old. However, when applying for jobs I was told that my days in health care were too long ago, so I took up a new master study at Erasmus School of Health Policy & Management (formerly iBMG) in Rotterdam (2005). And also starting a new consulting job with CQ-procesmanagement that mainly worked with mental healthcare organisations. The subject of this thesis concerned factors influencing people choosing home care. Preferring a job that sees to the end of the projects I was involved in, I applied with ZonMw (2006), Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development. My terms and discussions negotiations took place on the shores of the peninsula Sn\u00e6fellsness (Iceland) waiting for the ferry. I was programme manager for three programmes: Disaster management in hospitals (Ziekenhuisrampenopvang-plannen, ZIROP), Multidisciplinary guideline (Programma Alledaagse Ziekten (PAZ); programme together with the Dutch College of General Practitioners) before I was outsourced to a new advisory board for the minister of health; Councill for the Quality of Care (2009). Finally finding my niche: knowledge tools, knowledge translation and quality of care. Some feats of the Council of which I am proud: Guideline for Guidelines (working group), Glossary of quality health care, and the new edition of the 'manual' for evidence-based guideline development.

Not agreeing with the direction the institute was taking, I returned to ZonMw (2014). This time, as work package lead of the EU Joint Programming Initiative Antimicrobial Resistance (JPI AMR). In this capacity I contributed to the booklet Antibiotic resistance; what if antibiotics are no longer effective? Feeling I was drifting away from my PhD subject, I asked around within my network what a suitable working place would be for a person such as me. I 'ended up' at the Knowledge Institute of Medical Specialists (2015), as senior advisor and team lead. At the beginning of the guideline programme at ZonMw, I was interviewed and the article inadvertently referred to me as having a PhD. When rectifying this with the programme committee, some members said that they would welcome me if I ever wanted to do a PhD with them. In 2011 an opportunity arose when committe member Trudy van der Weijden was appointed professor at Maastricht University. Coming full circle, back in my home town, I started my PhD in summer 2012 and my PhD thesis was accepted in spring 2020.
