PCCM refers to an alternativ e health care case management system allowed for State Medicai d programs under the statutory author ity provided by section 1915(a)(1) and 1915(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act. These systems, in general, pr ovide for health care financing and delivery structures, which increase the responsibility of PCPs fo r the overall management of their patient's care, and make the physicians more aware of the financial implications of their hea lth delivery decisions. In establishing this increased responsibili ty, recipients are restri cted to their care mana ger as long as they are MTL 23/15 DIVISION OF HEALTH CA RE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: P MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: ADDENDUM October 1, 2015 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL DE FINITIONS Section P Page 9 enrolled, except in an emergency, for obtaining primary care and for authorization to receive certain other services. PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER (PCP) Physicians who practice general medicine, family medici ne, general internal medicine, general pediatrics, or osteopathic medicine.

A comprehensive, progressive, and individualized written Rehabilitative Plan must include all the prescribed Rehabilitation Mental Health (RMH) services. RMH services include: a. Basic Skills Training (BST); b. Program for Assertive Comm unity Treatment (PACT); c. Day Treatment; d. Peer-to-Peer Support; e. Psychosocial Rehabilitation (PSR); and f. Crisis Intervention (CI). The plan must include the appropriate treatment coor dination to achieve the maximum reduction of the mental and/or behavioral health di sability and to restore the recipien t to their best possible functional level. The plan must ensure the transparency of c overage and medical necessity determinations, so that the recipient, their family (in the case of legal mi nors), or other responsible individuals w ould have a clear understanding of the services that are made availa ble to the recipient. In all situations, the ultimate goal is to reduce the duration and intensity of medical care to the least intrusive level possible - while sustaining overall health. All prescribed services must be medically necessary, cl inically appropriate, and contribute to the rehabili tation goals and objectives. 2. The Rehabilitation Plan must includ e recovery goals. The plan must establish a basis for evaluating the effectiveness of the RMH care offered in meeting the stated goals and objectives. The plan must provide for a process to involve the beneficiary, and family (in the case of legal minors) or other responsible individuals, in the overall manageme nt of the RMH care. The plan must document that the services have been determined to be rehabilitativ e services consistent with the re gulatory definition, and will have a timeline, based on the individual's asse ssed needs and anticipated progress. 3. The reevaluation of the plan must involve the recipient, the recipien t's family (in the case of legal minors), or other responsibl e individuals. The reevaluation of the pl an must include a review of whether the established goals and objectives are being met and wh ether each of the services prescribed in the plan has contributed to meeting the stat ed established goals and objectives. If it is determined that there has been no measurable reduction of disa bility and/or function level restor ation, any new plan would need to pursue a different rehabilitation strategy including revision of the rehabi litative goals, objectives, services, and/or methods. The plan must identify th e rehabilitation goals and objectives that would be achieved under the plan in terms of measurable reduc tions in a diagnosed physical or mental disability and in terms of restor ed functional abilities. MTL 23/15 DIVISION OF HEALTH CA RE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: R MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: ADDENDUM October 1, 2015 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL DE FINITIONS Section R Page 4 4. Rehabilitation goals and objectives are often contingent on the individual's mainte nance of a current level of functioning. In these instances, services that pr ovide assistance in maintaining functioning may be considered rehabilitative only when necessary to he lp an individual achieve a rehabilitation goal and objectives as defined in the rehabilitation plan. The plan must be reasonable and based on the individual's diagnosed condition(s) and on the st andards of practice for provisions of rehabilitative mental and/or behavioral health serv ices to an individual with the individual's condition(s). The written rehabilitation plan must ensure that services are provided within the scope (therapeutic intent) of the rehabilitative services and would increase the lik elihood that an individua l's disability would be reduced and functional level restored. Rehabilitation plans ar e living documents and therefore must evolve in concert (show progressive transformations in the amount, duration, and scope of services provided) with the recipient's functional progress. The rehabilitati on plan must also demonstrate that the services requested are not duplicative (redundant) of each other. Th e written rehabilitation plan must: a. be based on a comprehensive assessment of an i ndividual's rehabilitation needs including current ICD diagnoses and presence of a func tional impairment in daily living; b. ensure the active participation of the individual, individual's family (in the case of legal minors), the individual's authorized health care decision maker and/or pers ons of the indivi dual's choosing in the development, review and modi fication of these goals and services; c. be approved by a QMHP, working within the scope of their pract ice under state law; d. be signed by the individual res ponsible for developing the plan; e. specify the individual's rehabi litation goals and objectives to be achieved, including recovery goals for persons with mental health related disorders; f. identify the RMH services intende d to reduce the identified physic al impairment, mental and/or behavioral health related disorder; g. identify the methods that would be used to deliver services; h. indicate the frequency, amount and duration of the services; i. indicate the anticipated provider(s) of the service( s) and the extent to which the services may be available from alternate provide r(s) of the same service; j. specify a timeline for reevaluation of the pla n, based on the individual's assessed needs and anticipated progress, but not long er than every 90 days or more frequently if needs change; k. document that the individual, the individual's family (in the case of legal minors), or representative participated in the development of the plan, signed the plan, and received a copy of the rehabilitation plan; and MTL 23/15 DIVISION OF HEALTH CA RE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: R MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: ADDENDUM October 1, 2015 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL DE FINITIONS Section R Page 5 l. document that the services have been determined to be rehabilitative services consistent with the regulatory definition. 5. Temporary, but clinically necessar y, services do not require an alte ration to Rehabilitation Plans; however, temporary services must be identified in progress notes. Thes e progress notes must indicate the medical necessity, amount, scope, durati on, and provider(s) of the service(s). 6. At a minimum, Rehabilitation Plans must include all of the following headings: a. Recipient's Full Name: b. Recipient's 11-Digit Me dicaid Billing Number: c. Intensity of Needs Determination: See Intensity of Needs Determination definition. d. SED/SMI Determination: See Severe Emotional Disturbance (SED) and Serious Mental Illness (SMI) definitions. e.

This setting provides an integrat ed and comprehensive array of services to meet the child's or adolescent's needs including, but are not limite d to, treatment services (psy chotherapies), educational services, psychological testing and eval uation, and a clinical tr eatment milieu designed to meet the individual needs of the child or adolescent who cannot effectively be helped within his/her home, substitute family, or in a less restrictive environment. RTCs specialize in trea ting children and adolescents with mental disorders including personality disorders, depression, hyperactivit y, academic failure, mild lear ning disabilities, and/or substance abuse disorders, as well as other clinical and behavioral psychopathologies. Recipients admitted to RTCs generally have experienced failed placements in the home, school, and community, and have exhausted all local resources. They need a highly structured environmen t with a therapeutic progra m in a residential setting with 24-hour supervision. All patients are provided individual, group a nd family therapies. An RTC may exist as free standing facility or as a unit within a psychiatri c hospital. Nevada Medicaid reimburses only RTCs licensed by the State Health Division's HCQC and accredited by the Joint Commission. RESOURCE UTILIZATION GROUPS Resource Utilization Groups (RUG-III) is a classification system which uses information from the MDS assessment to classify NF residents into a series of groups representing the resi dents' relative dire ct care resource requirements.

RESPITE SERVICE Refers to those services provided to e ligible recipients who are unable to car e for themselves. These services are furnished on a short-term basi s due to the absence or need for relief of those persons normally providing the care. This service provides general assistance with ADLs and IADLs, and provides supervis ion for recipients with functional impairments in their home or place of reside nce (community setting). Services may be for 24-hour periods, and the goal is relief of the primary caregiver. RESTORATIVE CARE Therapy services are considered to be \"restorative\" when there is an expectation that the patient's condition will improve in a reasonable (and generall y predictable) period of time. Medi cally necessary, restorative therapy services are eligible for c overage by Nevada Medicaid.

If an individual's expected potenti al for improvement in function (resto ration) would be insignificant in relation to the extent and duration of therapy services required to achieve such potential the therapy would not be considered reasonable and/or medically necessary. 2. If at any point in the treatment of an illness it is dete rmined that the expectations will not materialize, the services will no longer be considered reasonable and medically necessary; and they, therefore, may be excluded from coverage. 3. As a general rule, failure to progress towards goals after a reasonable time pe riod would no longer qualify as restorative.
