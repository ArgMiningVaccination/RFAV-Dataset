Knowing this reason is the key to unlocking your well-being, no matter what your health goals may be. In this article we're going to unpack the root of all chronic health issues and leave you with the top 5 ways you can help strengthen your gut so that you're ready to benefit from all other dietary and lifestyle interventions that Namaste or any other natural health practitioner may recommend in your healing journey. The gut and microbiome As you've certainly heard by now, talk about the gut and our microbiome are all the rage in the health world. That's because conventional medicine is finally starting to realize that poor gut health is at the center of nearly every major chronic illness we face. Even Hippocrates himself once stated that \"all disease begins in the gut\". The reason for this is quite simple. If you think about it, your gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus is actually outside of your body. It is your body's primary exposure to the outer world of pathogenic antigens your immune system deals with on a constant basis. It's no wonder then why 70% of your immunity resides in the gut lining, a statement that refers to the GALT, or gut associated lymphoid tissue. This delicate gut lining is also responsible for the absorption of vital nutrients from food that your body requires to function and thrive. It also happens to be where your microbiome lives, which is your natural colony of trillions of microorganisms that are responsible for so much of your health, from immunity, to digestion, to energy, to mental well-being. Why are our guts so damaged? So, what then is the reason why so many people's guts are in a poor state of health? To keep a long story short, here are just a few of those reasons: Our overuse of antibiotics and antibacterial products such as hand-sanitizers have sterilized and upset the delicate balance of friendly microorganisms to opportunistic ones, which means they can no longer function to keep our immunity robust, our digestion strong, our energy high, and our mental well-being balanced. To make matters worse, we ingest foods that damage the lining of the gut, which means larger food particles make their way past the intestinal tract where they belong, and into the bloodstream where the immune system attacks the foreign substance creating an incredibly damaging inflammation cascade, which ultimately leads to allergies and auto-immunity. In such a state of disarray, even if you try to eat healthy, you won't be able to properly absorb the nutrients, and you could be making matters worse by inadvertently ingesting foods with pesticides, glyphosate, heavy metals, or anti-nutrients such as lectins. True health starts in the gut With so many people's guts in disarray, it's no wonder why we struggle to improve our health while eating expensive healthy foods. People assume that a switch in diet is all they need to improve their health, but it's not so simple. You must first start by healing the #1 foundational pillar of your body's overall health before you can expect to benefit from all the other dietary and lifestyle changes you make. If you're experiencing any of the following symptoms/conditions, you likely have an issue with your digestion that needs to be addressed: chronic gut inflammation, leaky gut, food sensitivities/allergies, auto-immune diseases, thyroid issues, chronic fatigue, brain fog, joint pains, unusually smelly flatulence, skin conditions, mood issues, irregular bowel movements, constipation or diarrhea according to the bristol stool chart , chronic bloating, sharp stomach pains, and/or acid reflux. Top 5 ways to improve gut health naturally So then let's talk about the top 5 things you can start doing today to heal your gut and set your body up for future success. And while your gut epithelium repairs itself every 5-7 days, remember that true health is a life-long journey, not a destination. So here we go: 1. Acid boosters, digestive enzymes, and probiotics/prebiotics While you're in the process of healing your gut, certain key supplements can play a pivotal role in helping you to break down and absorb food the way you were meant to. Here are a few supplements you can add to your gut healing regime: Acid boosters - Hypochlorhydria is a common condition with people with compromised digestive systems and is increasingly more common the older you get. To boost acid levels, one of the following supplements can be helpful when taken correctly in the short-term: betaine HCL supplements, digestive bitters, or apple cider vinegar. There are specific ways to take each, so please work with your Naturopathic doctor or health coach to ensure you are doing this correctly. Digestive enzymes - Your digestive tract naturally produces enzymes to help break down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. However, this too is commonly inadequate in those with compromised digestive systems. Supplemental digestive enzymes can be helpful to aid in digestion and absorption, and there is little evidence to suggest any negative effects to taking them longer term if needed. There are also specialty enzymes that can help digest common inflammatory foods like dairy and gluten if you particularly struggle with those, but we generally suggest avoiding those foods during the gut healing phase anyway. Probiotics/Prebiotics - This is still a growing field of research, and while there is some debate as to whether probiotics populate your gut bacteria in the long run, they are undeniably effective at reducing symptoms while you are taking them. With these supplements, you always want to start slow (lower bacteria count), go with shelf stable (not live refrigerated), and invest in the higher quality brands. It's also not a bad idea to rotate the ones you're taking if you aren't working with a practitioner on a more targeted approach. As for prebiotics, taking these are arguably even more important than probiotics. Prebiotics are food that usually contain fiber and are also a group known as \"resistant starches\" that feeds and fuels your friendly bacteria. Eating leeks, onions, green bananas and cooked and cooled rice or potatoes are some examples of food-based prebiotics. Some probiotic supplements have prebiotics included in them, but it's a good idea to try a high quality, organic prebiotic fiber powder to mix in water and take every day during your gut healing phase. 2. Bone broth When it comes to healing the gut lining from damage to the tight junctions (leaky gut), nothing is more effective than a high-quality organic bone broth. The very best kind is homemade, but if you don't have the time for that there are many high-end brands, such as this one , which you can buy ready-made and enjoy regularly. Bone broth also is highly nutrient-dense and extremely easy to digest, so you are also giving your body much needed liquid nourishment. If you happen to be vegan and don't eat animal products, you can take a more nutraceutical approach and supplement with things like zinc-carnosine, quercetin and NAG. 3. Fermented foods Probiotics and prebiotic supplements are great in the short-term while healing, but you also want to ingest more natural/food-based sources that will be even more effective at rebuilding your gut microbiome sustainably. These foods include sauerkraut, kimchi, milk kefir and kombucha. With all of these it is always better to do homemade, but if buying store bought kefir or kombucha specifically, you want to make sure they are unsweetened or with as low of sugar as you can find (always read the labels). As you know, excess sugar is inflammatory and directly feeds the opportunistic and pathogenic microorganisms (such as candida), which you want to keep in check while healing the gut. Try and rotate fermented foods into your daily diet but start slowly to avoid bloating and discomfort. 4. Reduce stress We've seen many people brush off the impact of chronic stress when it comes to health because there isn't an obvious physical connection to the layperson. But to those who understand physiology, it's obvious why we have mountains of studies and evidence to confirm that long-term stress severely damages our health. And when it comes to our gut, this is no exception. Digestion takes an incredible amount of energy from the body, which is why it gets put on the back burner when your body is in a sympathetic (fight or flight) state of being. And if you live on planet Earth here in the 21st century, you very likely have some degree of chronic stress. Because of this, you must make it a priority to find your own unique way to take time to just chill out and relax every day. This doesn't mean just watching Netflix or being on your phone. One of the best ways is to just spend an hour each day taking a walk-in nature with the sun on your skin. There are also many natural therapies, such as acupuncture, massage and sound healing, which Namaste offers that can be part of your self-care routine. Whether it's reading, meditation, yoga, hiking, a calming hobby, it's important to find what works best for you and schedule it into your days and weeks. No matter who you are or what you do, nothing is more important than your peace of mind. 5. Avoid that which make matters worse We included this as #5 because there are many things that people do that are inadvertently making matters worse when it comes to your gut health. Here are just a few suggestions for things to avoid when possible: Be very cautious when taking prescription or even over the counter medications. Many of these quick and easy remedies create other serious issues when taken long-term, such as PPIs which actually shut down your stomach acid production and directly impair your ability to digest and absorb nutrients in your food. This includes medications like Tums, Nexium, Zantac and Pepto Bismol. This also includes antibiotics, which should be used only when necessary and with the aid of high potency probiotics before, during and after. Avoid commonly inflammatory foods, including known allergies and food intolerances. Depending on the degree of your gut condition and sensitivities, this will involve some level of an elimination diet. The most obvious foods to eliminate or significantly reduce are any and all processed foods, sugar, starchy grains/vegetables, gluten, eggs, soy, corn, dairy, improperly prepared beans/legumes/nuts/seeds, sugary drinks (including fruit juices), caffeine and alcohol. Do not overeat. Stop when you are 80% full so that your digestion is not further overwhelmed by the excess burden of digesting too much food at once. It has been noted that people that live in the Blue Zones (areas where the population has above average number of people that reach the age of 100) practice this regularly. Eat in peace. Many people are eating at their desk, standing up, on the go, alone in their car, or eating while on their phone or watching tv. You should always eat in a relaxed state, preferably with good company. If you're eating alone, then just eat uninterrupted or distracted. While we're on the subject, be sure to slow down your eating pace and chew extremely well. Your digestion starts in your mouth and it's important to allow your saliva to mix with your food and along with your teeth turn the food into chime before swallowing. This will aid your stomach and intestines in their task of digesting and absorbing the nutrients in your food, which is much needed when you're healing the gut. Stop eating after dinner. It is not good to snack late at night and you want to leave at least 2-3 hours of not eating before sleeping. Hopefully this has given you a good overview of the importance of the gut and why it is essential to start your healing journey here. These top 5 ways to heal your gut naturally are just some of the things you can do during stage 1 of your gut healing (there are a couple more stages).
