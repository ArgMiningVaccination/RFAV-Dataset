First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis as well as the four elements of nature (earth, water, fire and air) are represented by different symbols and colours. The visual is supported by a multicoloured smoke* reminding us of Indigenous spirituality but also the colours of the rainbow, symbol of inclusion and diversity of all First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis communities and their members. *Smoke is used in different ways by all three Indigenous groups in Canada. Whether it is to smoke fish and meat, to burn sage and tobacco, or for sacred ceremonies or celebrations, it is a significant symbol in Indigenous cultures.
