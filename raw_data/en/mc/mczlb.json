BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION Boise State University is propos ing a new interdisciplinary doctoral program in Biomolecular Sciences. The proposed program will be offered cooperatively by three departments in the College of Arts and Sciences, Biological Sciences, Chemistry and Biochemistry, and Physics. Faculty members in those departments have built the solid foundation of external funding necessary for highly successful doct oral science programs, having been awarded more than $26 million in the previous five years. The proposed program builds on the experience of these departments of delivering and/or participating in thesis -based master's programs in biology, chemistry, and materials science and engineering. The program will include participation from faculty members in several other departments Materials Science & Engineering, Mechanical & Biomedical Engineering, Computer Science, and Kinesiology) as well as participation by researchers at off -campus organizations (such as the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, the Mountain States Tumor and Medical Research Institute, and the Idaho Bureau of Laboratories. Although there are similar programs at the University of Idaho and Idaho State University, the proposed program is unique in Idaho, explicitly integrating the physical sciences into the biological sciences to create a cross -disciplinary degree. Per the Board's process for Ph.D. program consideration, an external review of the proposal was conducted. The review team was comprised of Dr. Lee Weber (Emeritus Faculty member University of Nevada, Reno), Dr. Sebastian Wachsmann- Hogiu (Facility Director of the NSF Science and Technology Center and Associate Professor of Pathology at UC Davis), and Dr. Judith Van Houten (University Distinguished Professor at the University of Vermont and Director of Vermont INBRE). The proposed program will facilitate continued collaboration among Idaho's three universities. It builds upon the highly successful statewide IDEA Network for Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE) program, which has brought more than $44 million in federal funding to Idaho to build infrastructure for National Institute of Health ( NIH)-fundable research through a collaborative effort among postsecondary institutions of Idaho. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS NOVEMBER 3, 2011 IRSA TAB 1 Page 2 A principal aim of INBRE is to improve the overall research productivity and grant competitiveness of states such as Idaho that have been less successful in receiving federal grants from NIH . The creation of the Ph .D. program at BSU as a stated deliverable of the Idaho INBRE program was specifically lauded by the NIH reviewers because it will broaden the range of grant opportunities to BSU, enhance collaboration between institutions , and impact Idaho's ability to compete for NIH funding. One specific example of broadening opportunities is training grants funded through the NIH Center for Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) program, which run in the millions of dollars but r equire that participating institutions grant Ph.D. degrees. The proposed program will also increase opportunities for the s haring of coursework and faculty expertise among institutions . With a Ph.D. program at Boise, existing and future collaborations on researc h grants will be enhanced by the sharing of membership on graduate c ommittees across institutions, and by the sharing of doctoral -level courses and seminars via distance delivery. The proposed program will provide substantial economic and societal benefit to the region, the state, and the nation. Faculty and students in the program will address a wide range of biomedical research topics at the molecular level in areas that include cancer biology, immune disorders, neuropathology, molecular toxicology, r egenerative medicine, antibiotic development, vaccine development, chemotherapy development, and nanomedicine. Molecular -level research at Boise State will aid in the understanding and treatment of diseases such as breast cancer, leukemia, osteoarthritis, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, asthma, cholera, West Nile Virus, and drug resistant bacterial infection. Besides the direct benefits of discoveries resulting from that work, there will be substantial potential for collaboration with the area's biom edical entities. Letters of support were provided by St. Luke's Health System, St. Alphonsus Medical System, the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, St. Luke's Mountain States Tumor and Medical Research Institute, and the Idaho Bureau of Laboratories. Additionally, research in the proposed program will support the development of Idaho's biotechnology industry. For example, present projects involve development of potentially -patentable materials such as artificial cartilage, biofuels, new chemoth erapeutic drugs, nano- based approaches for the treatment of cancer, and biosensors for detection of pathogens. In addition, the program will provide educational opportunities not currently available in the area, and thereby strengthen our workforce and make the area more attractive to businesses that may consider locating here. Letters of support were provided by several local biotechnology companies: and Boise Technology, Inc. Additionally, letters of support were provided by the Idaho Department of Agriculture and the Center for Advanced Energy Studies at INL. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS NOVEMBER 3, 2011 IRSA TAB 1 Page 3 BSU has made substantial investments in preparing for the proposed program. More than $10 million has been inves ted in the development of facilities that support biomolecular research. An NIH grant for $4 million is funding the creation of an animal facility. Nine faculty hires have been targeted in the biomolecular sciences in recent years, and the university has s et aside funds to the hire two additional faculty members and five new graduate assistantships. The results of the external review of the program were very positive. The executive summary of their report reads as follows (emphasis added); the entire repor t and BSU's response is attached to the full proposal. \"The review team was extremely impressed with the quality of research and graduate education and the remarkable level of extramural funding of the faculty engaged in biomolecular research whom we met at Boise State University. Most remarkable is that these achievements were accomplished with only a MSc program. A new level of research accomplishments can be reached with the implementation of an interdisciplinary PhD graduate program. It will foster the kind of collaborative research that is favored by federal and other agencies and produce uniquely trained students to satisfy the needs of a growing biotech and medical community in Idaho. The administrative and community support for this program is very evident . It will build upon the INBRE investments in the state to enhance the network of investigators and institutions. This proposed program does not duplicate programs elsewhere in the state and will present opportunities for investigators in the entire state system to participate in this collaborative, interdisciplinary research with PhD students. Our recommendation is that this program be implemented immediately .\" IMPACT The University of Idaho was the lead on both INBRE grants and had to approve Boise State's action plan, which included the development of a biomolecular Ph.D. as a deliverable, with a focus on building a particular strength in protein structure function. The U niversity of Idaho INBRE office has written several letters of support for the Ph. D. program. With regard to the current programs at the University of Idaho, they have expressed concerns that there is an overlap in on-going research in the areas of Biochemistry, Bioinformatic s, Cell Biology, Developmental Biology, Vaccine Development, Protein Structure Function, Plant Molecular Cell Biology, Immunology, Neuroscience, Molecular Genetics, Microbiology, Nanomaterials, Biophysics. With regard to the current programs at Idaho Stat e University, they initially felt there was significant overlap in the research areas of Biochemistry, Cancer Biology, Developmental Biology, Immunology, Neuroscience, Molecular Genetics, Microbiology, and Plant M olecular Cell Biology. However, after INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS NOVEMBER 3, 2011 IRSA TAB 1 Page 4 receiving additional information, Idaho State while maintaining concerns for the sustainability of three programs, wrote a letter of support that was read aloud at the September 2011 CAAP meeting. There is likely overlap in the programs between the Universit y of Idaho and Idaho State University. The University of Idaho expressed concerns regarding the duplication in Idaho State University's Ph.D. in Microbiology that was approved by the Board in April 2010. The current degree program offerings at the Univer sity of Idaho are: 1) Ph.D. in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (approved by the Board January 2003) 2) Ph.D. in Biology - which is a broad Ph.D. covering all areas of Biological Sciences (no records for when program was approved by the Board, likely took place prior to 2001 when Board office began its tracking system) 3) Ph.D. in Microbiology, Molecular Biology and Biochem istry - which includes Microbiology, Molecular Biology, Cell Biology, Developmental Biology, Biochemistry (no records for when program was approved by the Board, likely took place prior to 2001 when Board office began its tracking system) The current degree program offerings at Idaho State University are: 1) Ph.D. in Biology - which is a broad Ph.D. potentially covering all areas of the Biological Sciences (no records for when program was approved by the Board, likely took place prior to 2001 when Board office began its tracking system) 2) Ph.D. in Pharm aceutical Sciences - which includes Pharmacology, Pharmaceutics, Drug Discovery and Development (no records for when program was approved by Board, likely took place prior to 2001 when Board office began its tracking system) 3) Ph.D. in Microbiology - which includes M icrobiology (Molecular Biology, Biochemistry and Physiology, Genetics, Biotechnology, Virology, Industrial and Environmental Microbiology, and Medical Microbiology) (approved by the Board April 2010) Attachments 1 and 2 d epict fiscal impact of the proposed program, but they differ substantially in the specifics of what they depict and in the total dollars shown for each year. For personnel costs, Attachment 1 depicts only the value of the FTE specifically devoted to the P h.D. program, and includes reallocation of FTE from existing faculty and staff lines as well as a portion of the FTE of new faculty and staff lines. Attachment 1 also includes an estimate of personnel and capital outlay expenses that will be covered by federal grants, estimated at $1,366,856 in FY2015. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS NOVEMBER 3, 2011 IRSA TAB 1 Page 5 In contrast, Attachment 2 focuses on future funding that will support the new program , part of which has already been committed to biomolecular sciences activities at BSU and part of which remains to be co mmitted. The funding that is already committed is part of our overall commitment to the INBRE grant, and will be spent regardless of Ph. D. Approval. Importantly, Attachment 2 includes the entire cost of each new faculty and staff position, even if those positions are only partially assigned to the new program. This is because the university must fund each new position in its entirety, not simply that portion of each position assigned to the new program. Because Attachment 2 only includes committed funds, it only shows the grant funds associated with the initial two years of support for one of the new faculty lines. Other grant fu nded positions are not depicted in Attachment 2. To illustrate the difference between the tables , an example will be used: an existing faculty member will reallocate 0.15FTE to the new program and a new faculty member will allocate 0.25FTE to the new program. Attachment 1 would include the value of 0.15FTE from the existing faculty member and 0.25FTE of the new faculty member, thereby reflecting the value of the effort reallocated and newly allocated to the new program. Attachment 2, in contrast, recognizes that even though the new faculty member will devote 0.25 FTE to the new program, the university must fund the entire 1.0FTE of that faculty member in order to proceed with the hire of that person. Therefore, Attachment 2 would include the value of 1.0FTE of the new faculty member to reflect the entire cost of that individual. But Attachment 2 would not include any value for the existing faculty member because no new funding is needed f or the existing faculty member.

STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Board staff believes Boise State University (BSU) has put together a thorough and comprehensive proposal for a Ph.D. in Biomolecular Science. While there is overlap and duplication in the programs and their research areas, there are significant synergies t aking place among the three institutions in the broader biomolecular research areas. BSU has also very unique pieces to this proposed program which distinguish it from the other two institutions' program. With the creation of this program there is signific ant potential to increase NIH funding opportunities for Idaho. Boise State could better clarify the increased opportunities for collaboration among the three institutions. As it stands now, pursuant to Board Policy III.Z there is not a biology or biological science Statewide Program Responsibility assigned to any of the universities, INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS NOVEMBER 3, 2011 IRSA TAB 1 Page 6 therefore it would fall under the category of Boise State's Regional Program Responsibility. There is a Primary Emphasis in the area of Biological Sciences assigne d to Idaho State University, but not in the interdisciplinary areas of biomolecular sciences and biophysics. BSU's program is consistent with their current Regional Eight -Year Plan for delivery of academic programs in the Southwest Region. It's important to note that institutions are currently working on their Five- Year Plans pursuant to the recently clarified Board Policy III.Z. The Five- Year Plans are scheduled to be presented to the Board at their August 2012 Board meeting. \"The goal of INBRE -2 is to continue/enhance successful programs in order to catalyze Idaho's transformation to competitiveness through core laboratory facilities, support services, faculty research, student educational and research opportunities and community outreach.\" (pg. 3, INBR E External Review) The Board must consider whether or not this can be accomplished if the Board does not approve BSU's Ph.D. proposal, as it is a key deliverable of the INBRE proposal. The Board must also consider the risk of losing future funding if this program is not approved. Due to the funding requirements associated with the INBRE grant from NIH, BSU has over $400,000 committed to this program, with an additional $30,000 committed from the College of Arts and Sciences. They already have nearly half of the expenses at build out. There will be an additional $623,323 on- going new dollars required. The program funding is front -loaded the first two years and the on-going funding is significantly less. BSU proposes to use any new state general funds or EW A funding for faculty positions as they are the highest priority for new dollars. Reallocation of internal budgets is also a tool for providing new resources to the program. This might occur at the department, college, or university level - or all three. T his leads to outstanding questions regarding the resource allocations to be used for sustainability.

Program Approval and Discontinuance. 1. Describe the nature of the request. For example, is this a request for a new on-campus program? Is this request for the expansion or extension of an existing program, or a new cooperative effort with another institution or business/industry or a contracted program costing greater than $250,000 per year? Is this program to be delivered off-campus or at a new branch campus? Attach any formal agreements established for cooperative efforts, including those with contracting party(ies). Is this request a substantive change as defined by the NWASC criteria? Boise State University proposes the creation of a new Ph.D. program in Biomolecular Sciences. Over the last decade, the sciences have evolved dramatically to become less focused on traditional single disciplines and much more focused on interdisciplinary approaches. That approach extends to industry, which now often seeks highly trained professionals with expertise and knowledge based on an interdisciplinary approach to complex problems. The proposed program will be a highly interdisciplinary on-campus doctoral program housed in the College of Arts and Sciences that will combine studies from the traditional science disciplines of biology, chemistry, and physics to solve important cross-cutting problems at the interface of contemporary fields in biomolecular sciences. The program will focus on the (i) the study of complex nature of the molecules of biological systems as they relate to normal homeostatic and disease processes, (ii) the development of treatments for diseases as well as preventative measures such as vaccines, and (iii) the research and development of innovative devices and methodologies. The proposed Ph.D. in Bi omolecular Sciences will provide substantial economic and societal benefit to the region, the state, and the nation. Faculty and students in the program will address a wide range of research topics in ar eas that include cancer biology, immunology and immune disorders, neurobiology and neuropathology, pharmacology, skeletal biology, soft matter physics, molecular toxicology, forensic biology regenerative medicine, enzymology, cell membrane biophysics, plant growth regulation, microbial catalysis of biomass, bioinformatics for systems biology, antibiotic development, chemotherapy development, computer aided drug design, natural product drug discovery, nanomaterials, nanotoxicology, nanomedicine, and biofuels development. Benefits of this research include: (i) Our research will aid in the understanding of a number of diseases and in the development of treatments and preventative measures for those diseases; examples of those diseases include breast cancer, leukemias and lymphomas, osteoarthritis, Rett Syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, asthma, retinal detachment, cholera, West Nile Virus, and drug resistant bacterial infections (i.e., MRSA). (ii) Our research will support the development of Idaho's biotechnology industry. For example, present projects involve development of potentially-patentable materials as such artificial cartilage, anti-fouling compounds, biocompatible containment vessels, biofuels, targeted drug delivery methods, new chemotherapeutic drugs, nanomedicine based approaches for treatment of cancer, biosensors for detection of pathogens, and instrument development to support biotechnology and medical diagnostics. (iii) The program will provide educational opportunities not currently available in the area, and thereby strengthen our workforce and make the area more attractive to businesses that may consider locating here. \"This program will benefit Boise in many ways, but here are the most obvious to this mayor. Its students will be Boiseans while pursuing their degrees, contributing both economically and culturally to 'the mo st livable city in the country.' Many graduates will remain in the area, adding to our skilled workforce, advancing our existing biomedical enterprises and starting new ones. It is fact that higher- education research has a positive economic multiplier effect in its host city and far beyond. \"\u2014David Bieter, Mayor of Boise (Appendix B). \"Biomolecular studies have the potential to benefit far more than just one industry sector. Time after time, businesses seeking to expand in or relocate in Idaho look at the work force available in the state and the quality of life enjoyed there. Greater educational opportunities serve both these areas. Additionally, a Ph.D. program does not simply offer an outlet for students seeking educational advancement. A science-based doctorate degree option represents a real and tangible venue for ATTACHMENT 3 IRSA TAB 1 Page 10Revised 5-5-2010 3 solving problems that interface dozens of fields.\" \u2014Celia Gould, Director, Idaho Department of Agriculture (Appendix B). A recent report by the National Research Council \"Advancing the Nation's Health Needs\" (2005) identified the importance of interdisciplinary programs, stating that \"... the most significant r esearch occurs at the interfaces between traditional research areas. This is even more likely to be true in the future because the solution to complex biological and health care problems will require experts and expertise in many different disciplines - and increasingly expertise in more than one field. Consequently, it is important to encourage such research. If this research is to be successful, individuals must be broadly trained so that they can understand and contribute to research that overlaps in d ifferent fields.\" The proposed Ph.D. in Biomolecular Sciences is a key deliverable of Idaho's INBRE grant from NIH , which has been a highly successful cooperative effort among the universities. Since 2001, Idaho's BRIN/INBRE funding has totaled more than $44 million, and has provided funds to facilitate development of biomedical research in Idaho. It has also funded graduate assistantships at Idaho State to support programs such as the new Ph.D. in Microbiology and the creation of two new Ph.D. programs at the University of Idaho. From the very beginning of the BRIN/INBRE program, the creation of Boise State's Ph .D. in Biomolecular Sciences has been part of the plans. To quote from the INBRE proposal that was submitted in 2008 and subsequently funded (emphasis added; Appendix C) : \"2.5 Facilitate Gra duate Education INBRE will enhance the number and quality of graduate students in Idaho. At the UI, two new interdisciplinary doctoral programs were developed with INBRE-1 funding and are now supported by the UI Research Office...INBRE support for graduate students in the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology program will continue. At ISU, INBRE graduate assistantships and national travel awards will be assigned competitively. At BSU, the first PhD program in Biomolecular Sciences is being developed. BSU has approved five new faculty lines and an interdisciplinary curriculum. The first cohort of PhD students is expected fall 2010 and INBRE funds at BSU will support four of these graduate assistantships with additional assistantships provided by the BSU Research Office. \" In their draft Year 2 external evaluation for the NIH of the INBRE grant, the reviewers recognized the importance to Boise State University and to the Boise area of the Ph.D. in Biomolecular Sciences in maintaining the momentum created by the BRIN/INBRE grants (See Appendix C). \"The Committee was particularly impressed by the developing interdisciplinary biomolecular research program at Boise State University. If approved by the appropriate authorities, the Interdisciplinary Biomolecular Sciences PhD Program would be unique in the State, including researchers and students from biology, chemistry, eng ineering and other disciplines.\" The proposed Ph.D. in Biomolecular Sciences will strengthen the ability of Boise State University's faculty members to collaborate with faculty members in similar programs at the University of Idaho and Idaho State University . The value of the se collaborations among researchers far outweighs any potential negative impact of similarity of programs. That is the conclusion of the recent Year 2 evaluation of the INBRE grant for the NIH by an external evaluation team. In their specific recommendations, the draft evaluation report (attached; Appendix C) states (emphasis added): \"the Biomolecular Sciences PhD Program ...would be a unique interdisciplinary program, and would clearly complement and enhance the existing PhD programs at UI and ISU . The potential for inter- institutional collaborations between these programs is outstanding.\" A letter of support (attached; Appendix C) for the Ph.D. in Biomolecular Sciences from Dr. Carolyn Bohach, University of Idaho Faculty member and Director of Idaho INBRE, notes that (emphasis added): \"INBRE and the proposed Biomolecular Sc iences Doctoral Program are both multidisciplinary, collaborative, and focus on the continued growth of research and research- training programs.\" \"Your proposal for the establishment of a Biomolecular Sciences Doctoral Program builds on the early efforts of INBRE and will, I believe, complement existing graduate programs and serve Idaho well by creating a valuable training and research resource for the state.\" ATTACHMENT 3 IRSA TAB 1 Page 11Revised 5-5-2010 4 The proposed Ph.D. in Biomolecular Sciences will provide opportunities for sharing both the curriculum and faculty expertise among institutions. There will be increased reciprocal opportunities for faculty members to serve on graduate committees at other institutions. Graduate students enrolled in programs at the University of Idaho and Idaho State, and who spend significant time in the Treasure Valley, will be able to enroll in doctoral level coursework at Boise State University. Doctoral-level courses in the biomolecular sciences at Boise State will be made available via distance delivery methods to students at other institutions. The proposed Ph.D. in Biomolecular Sciences will engage faculty from the Departments of Biological Sciences, Chemistry and B iochemistry, and Physics, who have together won more than 26.6 million dollars in external research funding and shared research instrumentation funding over the past 5 years. This represents more than an 8-fold increase compared to the previous 5 years. Currently, there are 14.7 million dollars in pending grants f rom this group of research-active faculty members. This cadre of twenty-nine faculty researchers engaged in diverse areas of collaborative biomolecular research is one of the largest active research groups at Boise State University. The size, diversity of research, and synergy between the areas of research will help ensure th e success and sustainability of the proposed interdisciplinary doctoral program. In addition, the Biomolecular Sciences Ph.D. program is expected to have important synergistic activities with the proposed Materials Science doctoral program as at least eight of the core Biomolecular Sciences faculty members have research activities that dovetail with Materials Science faculty. In addition, the Biomolecular Sciences Ph.D. program is well aligned with the continuing areas of emphasis defined for Boise State University by the State Board of Education Institutional Role and Mission statement. 2. Quality - this section must clearly describe how this institution will ensure a high quality program. It is significant that the accrediting agencies and learned societies which would be concerned with the particular program herein proposed be named. Provide the basic criteria for accreditation and how your program has been developed in accordance with these criteria. Attach a copy of the current accreditation standards published by the accrediting agency. Further, if this new program is a doctoral, professional, or research, it must have been reviewed by an external peer-review panel . A copy of their report/recommendations must be attached. The following measures will ensure the high quality of the proposed program: Regional Institutional Accreditation . Boise State University is regionally accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU). Regional accreditation of the university has been continuous since initial accreditation was conferred in 1941. Boise State University is currently accredited at all degree levels (A, B, M, D). Program Review . Internal program evaluations will take place every five years as part of the normal program review process conducted by the Office of the Provost at Boise State University. This process requires a detailed self study (including outcome assessments) and comprehensive review, and a site visit by external evaluators. Graduate College . The program will adhere to all policies and procedures of the Graduate College, which is a member of the Council of Graduate Schools (Washington, D.C.), the leading authority on graduate education in the United States. The Graduate College has broad institutional oversight of all graduate degree and certificate programs. Disciplinary Standards: Although there is no discipline-specific accrediting body for graduate studies in biomolecular sciences, the Standards of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology for the Ph.D. Degree in the Molecular Biosciences will be adopted for the Biomolecular Sciences Doctoral Program at Boise State. These standards include: 1. The candidate should demonstrate a general knowledge of physics, chemistry, biology and cell biology, biochemistry and molecular biology, the particular Molecular Bioscience, and a detailed knowledge of his or her area of research. 2. The candidate should be familiar with the research literature of the particular Bioscience and should have the ability to keep abreast of major developments and to acquire a working background in any area. 3. The candidate should demonstrate skill in the recognition of meaningful problems and questions for research in the particular Bioscience. ATTACHMENT 3 IRSA TAB 1 Page 12Revised 5-5-2010 5 4. The candidate should possess technical skill in laboratory manipulations. 5. The candidate should demonstrate that oral, written, and visual communication skills have been acquired. 6. The candidate should demonstrate skill in designing experimental protocols and in conducting productive self-directed research. A Director of the Biomolecular Sciences Program will be appointed by the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, based upon the recommendation of department chairs of the three participating departments (Biological Sciences, Chemistry and Biochemistry, and Physics) to the Dean. The Director and the three chairs (Biological Sciences, Chemistry and Biochemistry, and Physics) will convene as \"partner administrators\" to discuss finances, policy, and administration of the program, and will meet with the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences as needed. A Faculty Steering Committee will be established with representation by a faculty member(s) from each of the participating disciplines: Biological Sciences (2), Physics (1) , and Chemistry and Biochemistry (1), plus the program director. This committee will serve 3 year terms using a model of off-set terms to ensure program continuity. This committee will focus on curriculum changes, policy, student recruitment, admission into the program, advising, st udent progress reports, and related responsibilities. An External Advisory Board will be established to provide experience and expertise that will ensure the quality of the program during the establishment phase and through annual review and evaluation. Membership will consist of representation from industry, similar programs at other universities, and biomedical research entities. The External Advisory Board will meet semi-annually with the Director and the Faculty Steering Committee. Qualifying Examination. All students in the proposed doctoral program will be required to pass a preliminary/qualifying examination to assess the depth and breadth of the student's knowledge in the biom olecular sciences. Questions will be developed by the program faculty, with the focus on material presented in the core sequence and the required undergraduate background courses in cell biology, bioch emistry, calculus, and general physics. The outcome of the preliminary examination will be determined by the Faculty Steering Committee. Failure of the preliminary examination will normally result in administrative withdrawal of the student from the program. In rare cases, and in accordance with Graduate College policy, a student may be allowed a second and final attempt to pass the examination before administrative withdrawal. a. Curriculum - describe the listing of new course(s), current course(s), credit hours per semester, and total credits to be included in the proposed program. The Biomolecular Sciences Doctoral Program is meant to provide students with advanced cross-training in the interdisciplinary fields of biochemistry, biophysics, cell biology, and molecular biology to foster an integrated and quantitative approach to biomolecular studies. The program is designed to provide every student with a three course core sequence by faculty in the departments of Biological Sciences (BMOL 601), Chemistry and Biochemistry (BMOL 602), and Physics (BMOL 603), to provide them with a foundation in biomolecular sciences while exposing them to the perspectives of each of these fields. Every student will take 12 credits of the core sequence (BMOL 601-603) during their first 1.5 years, as well as 10 additional credits in graduate seminars, scientific literature, writing and oral communications courses, and a scientific ethics course (BMOL 598, 605, 606, 607 and GCOLL 505, respectively). The program offers two tracks of study: Molecular Cell Biology, and Biochemistry/Biophysics, so students will also take 4-6 credits of track-specific coursework, as well as 12-14 credits of elective coursework approved by their supervisory committee.

Habig, Hanna, and Hiremath do not have program teaching assignments in the third year of the proposed program - FTE values in this table pertain to year three. Affiliate/Adjunct Faculty: Several affiliate faculty holding doctorate degrees or Ph.D./M.D. degrees that are conducting biomedical research in the Boise area (i.e., Boise VA Medical Center) will participate in the program as graduate student mentors, graduate student committee members, research collaborators, and instructors, including Dr. Amy Bryant, Dr. Richard Olson, Dr. Dennis Stevens, and Dr. Barry Cusack. c. Students - briefly describe the students who would be matriculating into this program. Students entering into the program would typically have an undergraduate degree in biochemistry, biology, biophysics, cell biolog y, chemistry, computer science, genetics, microbiology, physics, or a closely related field. The und ergraduate prerequisites for entry into this program include coursework equivalent to the following offerings at Boise State University: Cell Biology (BIOL 301), Biochemistry (CHEM 431), Calculus 1 (MATH 170), and General Physics or Physics with Calculus (PHYS 112 or PHYS 212). Deficiencies in some coursework pr erequisites do not necessarily prevent students from entering the program, as they may be remedied by taking additional coursework early in the program. The proposed program will bridge traditional fields of science into the multidisciplinary area of Biomolecular Sciences. Students trained in this program will acquire the essential skills to apply both theoretical and experimental knowledge to cross-cutting areas of biomolecular research. Because of the relative uniqueness of this multidisciplinary program, we intend to recruit students nationally and internationally, although an emphasis on recruiting students from the Western States region will exist. Initially, we anticipate some recruitment from a limited number of highly qualified Boise State undergraduate and Masters level students, as well as highly qualified students from other universities and colleges in Idaho. A concerted effort in student recruitment will be made from the onset, and with increased publicity and funding, a high quality applicant pool is expected to develop. d. Infrastructure support - clearly document the staff support, teaching assistance, graduate students, library, equipment and instruments employed to ensure program success. Staff support For the participating departments (Biological Sciences, Biochemistry and Chemistry, and Physics), currently 5 full-time administrative assistants, 2 grants accountants, 6 laboratory materials supervisors/stockroom managers, and numerous work-study staff provide support to the departments, students and faculty. In addition, the affiliated Biomolecular Research Center provides research technicians for research laboratories and shared research facilities and grant writing support staff. A college-level grants accountant also provides support to this group of faculty researchers. Boise State University provides staff for pre- and post-award grant administration. Pur chasing and research instrumentation acquisition for research are supported by Boise State University staff. Teaching Assistan ce and Graduate Students Assistance to faculty members will be provid ed by current graduate teaching assistants (13 in Biological Sciences, 3 in Biochemistry/Chemistry) that support existing Master of Science graduate programs. The implementation of the proposed program involves the creation of 15 additional teaching assistantships to support the program . Graduate students may be supported by any one of these new 15 teaching assistantship positions and/or through grant-funded research assistantships. It is anticipated that an initial student cohort will comprise 8 students in year 1, 8 students in year 2, and 14 students in year three for a total of 30 enrolled students by year 3 of program initiation. Library Resources ATTACHMENT 3 IRSA TAB 1 Page 24Revised 5-5-2010 17 Presently, library sources are not adequate for this program. Some funds are being committed at this time and we will develop a plan for further support of library resources as the program matures. Importantly, many relevant journals are available through the library through on-line subscriptions, including Science Direct, Elsevier Journals, and through inter-library loans. Research Equipment and Instrumentation Research equipment and instrumentation are adequate for the initiation of the program. In addition to instrumentation in faculty research laboratories, an aggregate ~$ 3.7 M awarded to Boise State University by the National Scienc e Foundation Major Research Instrumentation Program for shared, multi-user instrumentation supports biomolecular research including a fluorescent activated cell (FACS), a scanning x-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS), a confocal microscope, an x-ray, an analytical transmission electron microscope (TEM), a n electron spin resonance spectrometer, and a liquid chromatography mass spectrometer (LC-MS). Boise State supports these multi -user facilities with three permanent full-time research scientists that manage these instr uments. Below is a detailed list of equipment valued at greater than $100,000 supporting the proposed program. Table 2.

Facilities Computer labs: The departments involved in the Biomolecular Sciences graduate program have two networked laboratories dedicated for use by students enrolled in the proposed program. These computer labs have 74 workstations for general student and research use, and are networked to university servers. Research laboratories: Each faculty member listed in this proposal is conducting active research and has dedicated laboratory space with appropriate facilities to conduct research in their discipline. Laboratories are located in the Science building, the Multi-Purpose building, and the Math/Geosciences building. Animal Vivarium: Currently, researchers utilize the Animal Facility at the Boise VA Medical Center. A new research animal vivarium will be located on the Boise State University campus, to be built with funding from an NIH grant of nearly $4 million. Phase 1 construction consisting of ~6,370 sq. ft. is planned to begin in November 2011. Other Resources: The College of Arts and Sciences maintains an instrument repair shop. The Simplot-Micron Instructional Technology Center provides media support including film production and satellite television. To facilitate distance collaborations, a Tandberg video conferencing unit is available for Biomolecular faculty use in the nearby Business Building. Additional federal and state government laboratories in Boise and the vicinity conducting research or work related to the Biomolecular Sciences program include the Department of Veteran Affairs Medical Center, MSTI (Mountain States Tumor Institute), MSTMRI (Mountain States Tumor and Medical Research Institute), the Health and Welfare Department lab, and the State of Idaho laboratories. In addition, collaborations between BSU faculty researchers in the Biomolecular Sciences area and S t. Alphonsus and St. Lukes Regional Medical Centers are ongoing. The proposed program is also supported by the Boise State Biomolecular Research Center (BRC). e. Future plans - discuss future plans for the expansion or off-campus delivery of the proposed program. At the present time there are no plans to expand the proposed program off-campus. ATTACHMENT 3 IRSA TAB 1 Page 26Revised 5-5-2010 19 2. Duplication - if this program is unique to the state system of higher education, a statement to that fact is needed. However, if the program is a duplication of an existing program in the system, documentation supporting the initiation of such a program must be clearly stated along with evidence of the reason(s) for the necessary duplication. Describe the extent to which similar programs are offered in Idaho, the Pacific Northwest and states bordering Idaho. How similar or dissimilar are these programs to the program herein proposed? The University of Idaho and Idaho State University each have several Ph.D. programs that have similarities to the proposed Ph.D. program in Biomolecular Sciences. At the University of Idaho: The Ph.D. in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology has areas of focus: (i) biology, specifically focusing on the study and research of biological systems and the understanding of the molecular and genetic data, (ii) mathematics, specifically focusing on the methods and models used in genetic and molecular biological research, and (iii) computer science, with specific focus on the skills and techniques to develop and use databases and other data management systems. The Ph.D. in Biological and Agricultural Engineering includes specializations in water resources, bioremediation, or bi oenergy. The proposed program is closest to the third of those areas, which focuses on design and testing of new ways to produce biodiesel and other forms of alternative energy from feedstock such as locally grown canola oil or manufacturing waste. The Ph.D. in Biology has focus in three areas: (i) ecology and evolution (animal behavior, genetics, microbial ecology, systematics), (ii) neurobiology (retinal development and neurophysiology), and reproductive biology (development, endocrinology, fertility). The Ph.D. in Microbiology, Molecular Biology, & Biochemistry involves research in the following areas: bioremediation, biodegradation & molecular ecology; developmental and cellular biology; cell cycle regulation; molecular machines; pathogenic mechanisms in infectious disease; signal transduction and gene regulation; and biochemistry and protein structure/function The Ph.D. in Neuroscience involves investigations of the development, anatomy and physiology of the nervous system; research of cognitive and behavioral processes; and the application of mathematics and computer science to understand and model neurological function. At Idaho State University: The facul ty members of the Ph.D. in Biology have research expertise that falls into the areas of biomedicine, anatomy and physiology, ecology and evolution, microbiology and biochemistry, and science education. The faculty members of the Ph.D. in Microbiology have research expertise in the radiation effects in unicellular organisms; microbial stress the biogeochemistry of novel prokaryotic isolates; and the evolution of protein structure and function. The PhD in Pharmaceutical Sciences has focus in three areas: pharmacology (the study of drug action on biological systems), pharmaceutics (the design and evaluation of contemporary pharmaceutical dosage forms and drug delivery systems), and drug discovery & development (the process by which new or existing chemical species are found for the treatment of various diseases and carried through preclinical and clinical studies). We offer the following reasons to justify the creation of a new doctoral program that has similarities to existing programs at the other two universities. 1. The proposed program is distinct in its structure and emphases from those of Boise State's sister institutions. The uniqueness of the proposed program stems from its explicit bringing together of the disciplines of biology, chemistry, and physics, and more specifically the subdisciplines of molecular biology, ATTACHMENT 3 IRSA TAB 1 Page 27Revised 5-5-2010 20 cell biology, physiology, biochemistry, and biophysics. None of the above programs at University of Idaho or at Idaho State University includes faculty representation from all three disciplines of biology, chemistry, and physics. This point is reinforced in the specific recommendations that resulted from the recent Year 2 external evaluation for the NIH of the INBRE grant; the draft report (attached; Appendix C) states (emphasis added): \"The Committee was particularly impressed by the developing interdisciplinary biomolecular research program at Boise State University. If approved by the appropriate authorities, the Interdisciplinary Biomolecular Sciences PhD Program would be unique in the State, including researchers and students from biology, chemistry, engineering and other disciplines. The Committee noted the University's commitment of scarce resources to support this program. Moreover, it is essential for sustaining the research momentum in the Boise area after NIH INBRE funding sunsets. \" That said, we acknowledge that although it is a unique program, there remains a substantial potential for overlap among the programs. Therefore additional reasons follow. 2. The field of biomolecular science is vast and can easily accommodate multiple graduate programs, as is evidenced by the fact that the University of Idaho and Idaho State University each has several doctoral programs in related fields, as do essentially all research universities. In addition, there is little overlap at the areas of specific research focus of Boise State University researchers with the areas o f specific focus of researchers at the other institutions. The following table contains descriptions of areas of specific research focus research of the faculty members associated with the proposed Ph.D. in Biomolecular Sciences. Our examination of the web pages of faculty members at the University of Idaho and at Idaho State University revealed only occasional overlaps of specific research focus.

ATTACHMENT 3 IRSA TAB 1 Page 29Revised 5-5-2010 22 3. The program will facilitate collaboration and cooperation among the universities . The proposed progr am is a key deliverable of Idaho's INBRE grant from NIH, which has funded a highly successful cooperative effort among the three universities. As noted above, INBRE (and predecessor BRIN) grants have brought more than $44 million in federal funding to Idaho, providing funds to facilitate development of biomedical research and research collaborat ions in Idaho. In their draft report, the INBRE external reviewers recently stated in their draft report (attached; Appendix C; emphasis added) : \"...the Biomolecular Sciences PhD Program... would be a unique interdisciplinary pro gram, and would clearly complement and enhance the existing PhD programs at UI and ISU. The potential for inter- institutional collaborations between these programs is outstanding.\" A memo (attached; Appendix C) from Dr. Scott Minnich, faculty member at the University of Idaho and Associate Director of Idaho INBRE, notes that (emphasis added): \"In summary, the faculty, the environment, and the students at BSU are poised to expand graduate training at the Ph.D. level. The emphasis in biomolecular sciences will not only be unique, but will further enhance collaborations in the biomedical research across Idaho.\" As noted earlier in this proposal, a letter of support (attached; Appendix C) for the Ph.D. in Biomolecular Sciences from Dr. Carolyn Bohach, University of Idaho Faculty member and Director of Idaho INBRE, notes that (emphasis added): \"INBRE and the proposed Biomolecular Sciences Doctoral Program are both multidisciplinary, collaborative, and focus on the continued growth of research and research-traini ng programs.\" \"Your proposal for the establishment of a Biomolecular Sciences Doctoral Program builds on the early efforts of INBRE and will, I believe, complement existing graduate programs and serve Idaho well by creating a valuable training and researc h resource for the state.\" It is also worth noting the potential for collaborations between faculty members in the biomolecular sciences that exist outside the realm of biomedicine and the NIH. For example, in his work on microbial catalysis of biomass to create biofuels, Boise State University faculty member Dr. Kevin Feris is collaborating with several members of the University of Idaho faculty. 4. The proposed program will provide opportunities for sharing both the curriculum and faculty expertise among institutions. There will be increased opportunities for faculty members to serve on graduate committees at other institutions. Graduate students enrolled in programs at the University of Idaho and Idaho State, and who spend significant time in the Treasure Valley, will be able to enroll in doctoral level coursework at Boise State University. Doctoral-level courses in the biomolecular sciences at Boise State will be made available via distance delivery methods to students at other institutions. In his letter of support for the proposed program, (Appendix B) by Dr. J.W. Rogers, Director of the Center for Advanced Energy and Associate Director of INL, noted that the proposed program would be: \"...a nice complement to the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Program offered at the University of Idaho. \" 5. The program will provide substantial local benefit . As is described below and is documented in letters of support, the proposed program will (i) produce research results with the potential to have substantial economic benefit as intellectual property, e.g., biomaterials and biotechnological inventions, (ii) produce research results that provide societal benefit by increasing our understanding the causes of human disease and developing cures for those diseases, (iii) provide educational opportunities to local industry and government scientists, (iv) make the region more att ractive to biotechnology businesses considering relocation to this area. \"We...believe that [the proposed program] is an important step i n meeting the needs of our area. Personally, I believe that biotech is the greatest growth opportunity for the future. We can either prepare for it and benefit, or ignore it and be left behind.\" \"Our R&D includes many collaborations with universities...We would prefer to see more of this type of work being done in Idaho\"\u2014Steve Lackie, President of Sapidy ne, Inc. (Appendix B) ATTACHMENT 3 IRSA TAB 1 Page 30Revised 5-5-2010 23 The following are similar programs in nearby states. Molecular Biosciences Program, Montana State University . Areas of study include Cell, Developmental and Molecular Biology; Immunology and Infectious Disease; Bioinformatics; Bio-inspired Materials; Environmental Microbiology; Virology, and Plant Sciences. School of Molecular Biosciences, Washington State University . Molecular biosciences can be best viewed as a dynamic continuum in which approaches derived from chemistry, physics, and biology are utilized to address the fundamental mechanisms of living things. The School offers Ph.D. degrees in Biochemistry, Biotechnology, Genetics and Cell Biology, and Microbiology. Options within these degrees offer flexibility to add emphasis in chemistry, molecular biology, physics, and biotechnology. Biomolecular Science and Engineering Program, UC Santa Barbara .

Students earn their graduate degree in one of three dissertation programs: Biochemistry, Cellular and Molecular Biology, and Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology and Physiology. 4. Centrality - documentation ensuring that program is consistent with the Board's policy on role and mission is required. In addition, describe how the proposed program relates to the Board's current Statewide Plan for Higher Education as well as the institution's long -range plan. The following excerpts are from the current role and mission statement formulated by the State Board of Education (SBOE). The excerpts indicate that the proposed program is consistent with SBOE intentions for Boise State University. Boise State University \" offers a variety of masters and select doctoral degrees \" and \"conducts coordinated and externally funded research studies \". \"Boise State University is a comprehensive, urban university se rving a diverse population through undergraduate and graduate programs, research, and state and regional public service\". \"Boise State University will formulate its academic plan and generate programs with primary emphasis on business and economics, engineering, the social sciences, public affairs, the performing arts, and teacher preparation. Boise State University will give continuing emphasis in the areas of the health professions, the physical and biological sciences , and education and will maintain basic ATTACHMENT 3 IRSA TAB 1 Page 31Revised 5-5-2010 24 strengths in the liberal arts and sciences , which provide the core curriculum or general education portion of the curriculum \". The proposed program is also consistent with the strategic plan for Boise State University, called Charting the Course , whi ch places a focus on \" exceptional research defined by progressive scholarship and creative activity, and graduate programs that have groundbreaking applications locally, regionally, and globally \". 5. Demand - address student, regional and statewide needs. a. Summarize the needs assessment that was conducted to justify the proposal. The needs assessment should address the following: statement of the problem/concern; the assessment team/the assessment plan (goals, strategies, timelines); planning data collection; implementing date collection; dissemination of assessment results; program design and on-going assessment. (See Board policy III.X. , Outcomes Assessment .) There is a substantial need for the educational opportunities that a PhD program in Biomolecular Sciences would provide, for the resulting PhD graduates, and for the research that a PhD program in Biomolecular Sciences would produce. The needs assessment that led to this proposal was garnered from a number of sources over the past 5 years. Direct inquiries from prospective students to the departments and faculty expressing their interest in a biomolecular-related doctoral program is one of the primary motivations for the proposed program. Additional support has been provided by various local businesses and employers interested in highly trained graduates with expertise in biomolecular science-related disciplines and in the research that would result from the program. Letters of support from various local biomedical and biotechnological research companies, research institutes, hospital systems, and government agencies are attached in Appendix B. A. The National Need f or Research by PhD students and their Faculty Mentors The National Institutes of Health devotes more than $21 billion per year towa rds biomedical and biomolecular research. The National Science Foundation and other agencies, including the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense, also devote a large amount of funds in support of biological and biomolecular research (i.e., $6.2 billion, $604 million, $94 million, respectively). Furthermore, a number of foundations, including the M.J. Murdock Charitable Trust, the American Federation for Aging, and the Susan Komen Breast Cancer Foundation also invest substantial sums in grants to biological research. The fact that various federal and private entities collectively fund many billions of dollars worth of research grants each year illustrates the great need for research in the biological and biomolecular sciences. The proposed academic program will fuse physical sciences and the basic molecular life sciences into a single curriculum, removing traditional barriers to interdisciplinary thinking, training, and research at the interface between the life sciences, chemistry, physics, and computational biology. Our interdisciplinary doctoral program in Biomolec ular Sciences will benefit from and contribute to the increasing synergy between life sciences and the physi cal sciences, and will contribute to growth in areas such as biotechnology, biomaterials, and nanobiotechnology in the public and private sectors. Research presently underway at Boise State University demonstrates that the proposed program will help meet research needs of federal and private entities. For example, We are presently conducting projects that will provide basic information on the causes of various diseases, to aid in the development of therapies. Examples include breast cancer, leukemias and l ymphomas, osteoarthritis, Rett Syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, asthma, retinal detachment, cholera, vaccine development, West Nile Virus, drug resistant bacterial infections (i.e., MRSA), parasitic infections, and genetic analysis of human populations. We are presently conducting projects that will aid in the development of materials that will be of substantial use to society. Examples include artificial cartilage, anti-fouling compounds, biocompatible containment vessels, biofuels, targeted drug development for treatment of microbial infections and new chemotherapeutic drugs, nanomedicine based approaches for treatment of cancer, biosensors for detection of pathogens, and instrument development to support biotechnology and medical diagnostics. ATTACHMENT 3 IRSA TAB 1 Page 32Revised 5-5-2010 25 B. The Local Need for Research and for Graduate Educational Opportunities. 1. Local Industry. The local biotechnology industry will benefit from the creation of a highly-trained local workforce and from research discoveries that come from the new program. It is important to note that companies often will assess the availability of appropriate educational programs before relocating to an area. The following quotes are from letters of support from local industry (attached; Appendix B) : \"It would be favorable for us if BSU were to have a PhD program in Biom olecular Sciences for developing a local candidate pool as well as for establishing greater collaboration potential between us and the university.\"\u2014 Michael Hill, PhD, President of Boise Technology, Inc. \"[the proposed program] will provide an advanced deg ree option in interdisciplinary Biomolecular Science for employees who would otherwise need to relocate to pursue advanced education in the areas of biochemistry, bioinformatics, biophysics, cell biology, and molecular biology .\"\u2014Sandy Koch, Biology Supervisor, and Brian McGovern, Microbiology Supervisor, Analytical Laboratories, Inc. \"Having local access to graduate level science courses would be a great asset to our employee development and talent management.\" \"It would be an asset to our research endeav ors in Idaho to have access to specific courses or a full PhD program without travel or relocation...\"\u2014Teresa Mitzel, Head of Product Evalu ation and Advancement, Syngenta Seeds, Inc. \"The field of medicine is changing as technologies continue to advance rap idly. All companies must keep up in order to stay competitive. For this reason, we welcome a program where innovative research in drug development and biomedical research occur in our home town.\"\u2014Carl Thornfeldt, M.D., Founder and CEO of Episciences, Inc. \"At OD260, Inc., we value a workforce with this type of advanced education. Graduates of the PhD program in Biomolecular Sciences will be prepared and well aligned to industry requirements.\"\u2014Xavier Danthinne, PhD, President of O.D.260, Inc. 2. Biomedical Research and Health Care Organizations. There are several regional research and health care entities that would benefit from PhD-level scientists trained in biomolecular sciences. These include basic and clinical researchers located at the 1) Boise VA Medical Center (VAMC), 2) Mountain States Tumor and Medical Research Institute (MSTMRI), 3) Mountain States Tumor Institute (MSTI) , 4) St. Luke's Health System, 5) St. Alphonsus Health System, and 6) the Idaho Bureau of Laboratories. A variety of clinical and federally funded biomedical research programs are conducted at each of these facilities. The Boise VAMC has long history of biomedical research with research programs specializing in pulmonary diseases, drug resistant microbial infections, cardiovascular disease, pharmacology, mechanisms of cancer chemotherapeutics, and new drug development. Growth in the research capacity at the Boise VAMC is expected to increase with construction of a new research building planned for this year. A local pool of biomolecular sci ence PhD graduates will enhance the established VA research programs, and is also important for attracting new research scientists to the ir expanding facility. It is also important to note that many of the VAMC researchers have active collaborations with faculty participants listed on this proposal . Thus, the existing synergy between VAMC and Biomolecular Science research faculty would be further enhanced by the implementation of the proposed doctoral program, and the VAMC leaders have indicated that our graduates would be actively recruited. \"...we are happy that Boise State will be supporting a program that will train scientists who are capable of doing high- quality independent research who can work as part of an interdisciplinary team...\"\u2014 Dennis Stevens, PhD, MD, Associate Chief of Staff for Research and Development, Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Appendix B) Researchers at MSTMRI and MSTI, which are part of the Boise- based St. Luke's Health System also conduct a variety of research projects including federally funded initiatives as well as applied clinical research. There is ATTACHMENT 3 IRSA TAB 1 Page 33Revised 5-5-2010 26 already a strong relationship between MSTMRI and many of the BSU faculty researchers are members of this organization. MSTMRI provid es pilot project grants so researchers can obtain crucial preliminary data and parlay this opportunity into larger federally funded grant awards. Reciprocal exchanges of student researchers between BSU biomolecular science faculty and MSTMRI researchers is fairly common, and expected to be even more commonplace with the implementation of the proposed doctoral program. One of the expressed future goals of MSTMRI is to facilitate translational research which strives to bridge the gap between basic research and new approaches and improvements to patient care. To meet this goal, a local pool of PhD-level researchers is an important consideration. \"We...have long valued our association with the faculty at Boise State, and look forward to working with the graduates of the Biomolecular Sciences program. We have a special interest in individuals who might undertake translational cancer research.\"\u2014Theodore Walters, MD, Director of St. Luke's MSTMRI (Appendix B) Researchers and clinicians associated with St. Luke's Health System and St. Alphonsus Health System will also benefit from collaborations with our faculty members and from the research that will result from the program. \"Our physicians have enjoyed the collaboration with your many scientific centers and agree such a PhD program will further the efforts to serve the people of our region. By joining forces with your biologists, chemists, biochemists, and physicists with our clinical physicians, pharmacists, and nurse researchers we will indeed create an advanced and contemporary atmosphere for the advancement of students' education and experience.\"\u2014David Pate, MD, JD, President and CEO, St. Luke's Health System. (Appendix B) The Idaho Bureau of Laboratories provides the state with research in the realm of public health. \"The program's r esearch foci in bioinformatics, genomics, molecular forensics, vaccinology, and next generation antibiotic development are particularly relevant to public health laboratory work. As such, the Idaho Bureau of Laboratories (IBL) would benefit from close association with faculty and students in the program. \"\u2014Christopher Ball, PhD, Bureau Chief, Idaho Bureau of Laboratories (Appendix B) 3. Energy Research Entities. One of the research programs in our proposed program focuses on the development of microbial catalysts that can be used to convert various forms of biomass into third-generation biofuels. The research from that program and the students trained in those methodologies will benefit the state of Idaho. \"...we have active programs in bioenergy, biofuel s, biocatalysis, bioconversion, microbiomes, and biological aspects of carbon management...At the INL and CAES, we are constantly seeking qualified scientists and engineers to work in these disciplines and typically we must recruit out of state. Your proposed program would go a long way toward providing a highly skilled workforce programs as well as the ever-increasing workforce pipeline necessary to support the growing biotechnology industry in the state of Idaho. \"\u2014J.W. Rogers, Jr., Director of the Center for Advanced Energy Studies and Associate Director of the Idaho National Laboratories (Appendix B) \"...the program has the potential to have substantial impact on Idaho's ability to create alternative forms of energy and diversify ou r economic base.\"\u2014 John Chatburn, Interim Administrator, Office of Energy Resources, State of Idaho (Appendix B) b. Students - explain the most likely source of students who will be expected to enroll (full-time, part-time, outreach, etc.). Document student demand by providing information you have about student interest in the proposed program from inside and outside the institution. Need for an interdisciplinary PhD program by potential local and out-of-area students. Boise State faculty members receive numerous inquiries each year from students interested in receiving a PhD in Biomolecular Sciences. The bulk of these inquiries come from outside of the area, from people who have assumed Boise State already has a PhD in Biomolecular Sciences (or related area) in place. Faculty also receive numerous ATTACHMENT 3 IRSA TAB 1 Page 34Revised 5-5-2010 27 inquiries from individuals employed locally (e.g., local biomedical research entities) about the expected timing for a Biomolecular Sciences doctoral program. The need extends not only to providing training to students at the doctoral level, but that the training will be delivered at the intersection of disciplines thereby preparing students for the manner in which future research will be conducted. \"Given the interdi sciplinary nature of the program, several IBL employees have expressed interest in enrolling when the program is approved. Having IBL scientists in this program would provide an excellent opportunity to advance the research, training and outreach missions of the Bureau .\"\u2014 Christopher Bal l, Bureau Chief, Idaho Department of Laboratories (Appendix B) \"...having a local graduate program for graduate level studies would help with our employees who wish to further their education.\"\u2014Steve Lackie, President, Sapidyne, Inc. (Appendix B) Failure to provide graduate education opportunities may lead to the loss of valuable workers by local industry. \"We have lost a few of our brightest junior level scientists to graduate schools out of state. We would welcome local graduate programs that might help us to retain our brightest with the opportunity to enroll in a local graduate program.\"\u2014Michael Hill, PhD, President of Boise Technology, Inc. (Appendix B) \"We have had several undergraduate level employees continue their education, and so far this has meant leaving the area. This is not only a loss to our company, but is also a loss of talent to the state.\"\u2014Steve Lackie, President, Sapidyne, Inc. (Appendix B) The establishment of the Biomolecular Sciences PhD program has been in discussion for several years, and students have enrolled at Boise State, anticipating the beginning of the program. Therefore, during the first year of the proposed program, due to demand and the number of highly qualified students, we expect that most (80%) of prospective students will be fulltime students who have recently graduated with an undergraduate BS degree from Boise S tate University or the surrounding Treasure Valley area. The remaining 20% of students are expected to be part-time students, or recent graduates, who are now employed in the local workforce seeking a graduate de gree for career advancement. By year two of the program, our national recruitment efforts will be well underway and we expect that ~50% of students in the program will be from the local area, with the remaining 50% recruited from out of state. By the end of the year five, we expect that ~70% of students will be recruited from out of state. We are anticipating a cohort of 8 students in year one, followed by 8 more students in year 2, and ramping up to a combined total of 30 students by year 3 of program implementation. Differentiate between the projected enrollment of new students and those expected to shift from other program(s) within the institution. Projected enrollment is expected to be largely based on new students entering the program. Any shifts from other on-campus programs would likely be from chemistry or biology students who have entered the Masters of Science programs in these departments because a doctoral degree was not available. Based on differences in program completion times and desired employment goals pending graduation, it is expected that only a few students would shift programs. d. Expansion or extension - if the program is an expansion or extension of an existing program, describe the nature of that expansion or extension. If the program is to be delivered off-campus, summarize the rationale and needs assessment. NA - the proposed program is a new program that will be delivered on the Boise State University main campus. ATTACHMENT 3 IRSA TAB 1 Page 35Revised 5-5-2010 28 6. Resources - fiscal impact and budget On this form, indicate the planned FTE enrollment, estimated expenditures, and projected revenues for the first three fiscal years (FY) of the program. Include both the reallocation of existing resources and anticipated or requested new resources. Second and third year estimates should be in constant dollars.

NOTES for Line Items in Tables I, II, and III I.A One student FTE is assumed to be 24 student credits; not every student is projected to take 24 credits per year. I.B Although some students may shift from M.S. programs into the Ph.D. program, this effect is expected to be negligible. II.A.1 Faculty FTE estimates are tied to university faculty workload policy 4560 and based on three-year teaching plans from the Department of Biological Sciences, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, and Department of Physics. Faculty cost estimates are based on academic year salaries, with FY11 salaries assumed for the first year of the program, and then 2% annual adjustments applied for the second and third years of the program. See tables attached after section 6.e for details. II.A.2 Administrative FTE estimates are based on experience with existing PhD programs at the university and allow for the multi-departmental nature of the proposed program. Administrative cost estimates are based on administrative contract salaries that vary from 10 months to 12 months depending on the position, with FY11 salaries assumed for the first year of the program, and then 2% annual adjustments applied for the second and third years of the program. See tables attached after section 6.e for details. II.A.3 Use of adjunct faculty is not anticipated for this program. II.A.4 The university will fund (in year 3) fifteen graduate instructional assistants; those GAs will not teach in the PhD program but will provide assistance with the delivery of undergraduate programs and provide research assistance in the summer. Therefore, the FTE devoted to the proposed program is calculated as one-half of the university-funded GAs, i.e., 7.5 FTE in the third year. It is estimated that by the third year an equal number of graduate assistantships (i.e., 15) will be funded through federal grants; therefore for that year, 7.5FTE funding for graduate assistantships is ascribed to appropriated funds and 15FTE to federal funds. A graduate assistantship includes a 12-month $24,000 stipend and an academic year tuition and fee waiver. Annual adjustments of 2% and 5% are assumed for stipends and tuition and fee waivers, respectively. II.A.5 See tables attached after section 6.e for details on research and research support personnel. II.A.6 See tables attached after section 6.e for details on administrative support personnel. II.A.7 Fringe benefits are computed using FY11 fringe rate parameters defined for various employee categories by the university budget office and available at http://finad.boisestate.edu/budget/pdf/FY11fringe.pdf . The fringe rate for graduate assistants is computed at 4% during the academic year but 10% during the summer as requested by the university research office. II.A.8 The FY11 cost of a full-time academic year graduate tuition and fee waiver is $7,774. This cost is projected into future years using an assumed annual increase of 5%. Thus, we project a full-time academic year graduate tuition and fee waiver to be $7,774x1.05x1.05 = $8,571 at program start in FY13, and then to increase annually by 5% for the first three years of the program. II.B.10 The program is expected to increase administrative operating expenditures by $36,000 per year distributed variably among irregular salaries, travel, communications, student recruiting expenses, seminar speakers, and materials and supplies. Annual percentage increases of these costs are not projected but this line will be adjusted to reflect actual experience with the program. II.C.1 Cost estimates for new library resource cost are based on discussions between program faculty and the Dean of Libraries. See section 6.d for details. II.C.2 Of the costs listed here, $200,000 per year is the estimated new faculty startup costs that will be paid in each of the first three years of the program (startup costs are one-time costs). The source of startup funds is indirect costs from federal grants. See section 6.d for details. We estimate that an additional $250,000 per year will be secured from federal equipment grants, such as Major Research Instrumentation grants. We have averaged approximately that amount in past years. II.E Indirect costs associated with the proposed program are not estimated for this proposal, but are part of the indirect cost structure of the university. ATTACHMENT 3 IRSA TAB 1 Page 38Revised 5-5-2010 31 III.A.3 Estimate of funding from federal grants is based on current grant funding of tenured/tenu re-track faculty salaries , current grant funding of research staff, and estimated grant funding of graduate assistantships (see note II.A.4 above). III.B. See explanation in section 6.e. below. 6.a. Faculty and Staff Expenditures Project for the first three years of the program, the credit hours to be generated by each faculty member (full-time and part-time), graduate assistant, and other instructional personnel. Also indicate salaries. After total student credit hours, convert to an FTE student basis. Please provide totals for each of the three years presented. Salaries and FTE students should reflect amounts shown on budget schedule. Project the need and cost for support personnel and any other personnel expenditures for the first three years of the program. Detailed three-year lists and projections for faculty and staff expenditures, including research, research support, and administrative support personnel, are provided in the tables attached after section 6.e. 6.b. Administrative Expenditures Describe the proposed administrative structure necessary to ensure program success and the cost of that support. Include a statement concerning the involvement of other departments, colleges, or other institutions and the estimated cost of their involvement in the proposed program. The program director will report to the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences as a Chair-level administrator. The three department chairs of Biology, Chemistry, and Physics and the director will work as a group to manage finances, policy, and administration of the program. The director and three department chairs will work together to ensure that the required courses are taught on an appropriate schedule, to ensure the equitable assignment of resources such as graduate teaching assistantships, and to ensure effective management of program processes such as student recruitment, admission recommendations, student advising, progress exams, and dissertation defenses. The director and the chairs will be supported by an appropriate number of administrative support personnel. Detailed three-year lists and projections for administrators and administrative support personnel are provided in the tables attached after section 6.e. 6.c. Operating Expenditures (travel, professional services, etc.) Briefly explain the need and cost for operating expenditures. The proposed program is expected to generate increased annual administrative operating costs estimated at approximately 3% of the program personnel costs or $36,000. These increased administrative operating costs will vary from year to year among irregular salaries, travel, communications, student recruiting expenses, seminar speakers, and materials and supplies. Increased research operating costs are to be paid by grants and contracts. 6.d. Capital Outlay (1) Library Resources (a) Evaluate library resources, including personnel and space. Are they adequate for the operation of the present program? If not, explain the action necessary to ensure program success. Library staff members have analyzed our holdings in light of the proposed program and have identified library resources needed t o improve the quality of the program. At this time $45,000 per year has been committed to purchase top priority items. A plan is being developed to continue to build the strength of the library resources for the proposed program. (b) Indicate the costs for the proposed program including personnel, space, equipment, monographs, journals, and materials required for the program. See comments below in Section 6.e. below regarding the investment of funds in space for laboratories and an animal care facility. (c) For off-campus programs, clearly indicate how the library resources are to be provided. ATTACHMENT 3 IRSA TAB 1 Page 39Revised 5-5-2010 32 The proposed program is not an off campus program. (2) Equipment/Instruments Describe the need for any laboratory instruments, computer(s), or other equipment. List presently available equipment and any equipment (and cost) which must be obtained to support the proposed program. Presently available equipment, instrumentation, and special research facilities are described in the body of this proposal. New faculty hires associated with the proposed program will require one-time startup expenditures, primarily for instrumentation. These startup expenditures are projected to be $200,000 in each of years one, two, and three of the program. In addition, the University has been very successful in securing Major Research Instrumentation grants from the National Science Foundation, averaging approximately $250,000 per year. 6.e. Revenue Sources (1) If funding is to come from the reallocation of existing state appropriated funds, please indicate the sources of the reallocation. What impact will the reallocation of funds in support of the program have on other programs? The creation of the proposed PhD in Biomolecular Sciences has been our goal since the very beginning of BRIN/INBRE a decade ago, and Boise State University has already invested substantial resources to lay the foundation for the proposed program: Nine new tenure-track faculty hires have been made in support of the Ph.D. in Biomolecular Sciences; four additional hires are planned. Additionally, four new research faculty members will participate in the PhD BMS. o Two new biomolecular faculty lines were funded initially by INBRE and subsequently by the university. o Two new biomolecular faculty lines were created and funded by the university, one initially by an EPSCoR grant. o Five biomolecular faculty lines were hired as retirement replacements with the Ph.D. in Biomolecular Sciences in mind during the hiring process. Approximately $13 million has been spent or committed to create facilities that support biomolecular research. o $3.4 million of PBFAC Set B funding spent to convert and remodel space for new research laboratories, in order to accommodate new biomolecular PhD faculty members. o $5.4 million of PBFAC Set B funding spent on HVAC and electrical upgrades of buildings that house biomolecular research laboratories. o $4.2M (including $3.9 million from an NIH CO6 grant) committed for a new vivarium devoted to research in the biomolecular sciences. In addition, the university has committed $448,601 of ongoing funding (as of year 4 of the program) and $600,000 of one-time funding as part of our obligations to the INBRE grant. The ongoing funding will fund two faculty mem bers, a staff member, five graduate assistantships, and a portion of the needed library resources. The one-time funding is for startup equipment, etc., for new faculty members. To complete our preparation for the proposed program, we will need to fund the hiring of 2 additional new tenure-track faculty members, one lecturer, 10 additional graduate assistants, and assorted staff members, as well as other resources such as library materials. The resulting total ongoing commitment, as of year 4 of the program, will be $623,323; an additional $100,000 of one time funds will be needed. The source of those funds will be a reallocation over the next several years from various sources, including salary savings and expense reductions in other areas. In addition, new funding will be committed from any increases in state and tuition revenues and Enrollment Workload Adjustment funding as that funding becomes available. This is consistent with how the University has funded new graduate programs in the past. See section (3) below for additional information. Detail of our existing commitments to the INBRE grant as well as new funds needed to fund the proposed program may be found in the table on the following page.

There is not a plan to request MCO funds as part of a legislative appropriation. (3) Describe the federal grant, other grant(s), special fee arrangements, or contract(s) to fund the program. What does the institution propose to do with the program upon termination of those funds? Although the university did use NIH funding (BRIN and INBRE programs) to start two new faculty positions in the biomolecular sciences over the past decade, these positions are now fully funded by the university. One additional position will be funded initially by INBRE then funded by the university. After program start, grant and contract funding will be used to support the direct and indirect costs of research activities.

Executive summary The review team was extremely impressed with the quality of research and graduate education and the remarkable level of extramural funding of the faculty engaged in biomolecular research whom we met at Boise State University. Most remarkable is that these achievements were accomplished with only a MSc program. A new level of research accomplishments can be reached with the implementation of an interdisciplinary PhD graduate program. It will foster the kind of collaborative research that is favored by federal and other agencies and produce uniquely trained students to satisfy the needs of a growing biotech and medical community in Idaho. The administrative and community support for this program is very evident. It will build upon the INB RE investments in the state to enhance the network of investigators and institutions. This proposed program does not duplicate programs elsewhere in the state and will present opportunities for investigators in the entire state system to participate in this collaborative, interdisciplinary research with PhD students. Our recommenda tion is that this program be implemented immediately. B. Review Process Drs. Lee Weber (Emeritus Faculty member University of Nevada, Reno), Sebastian Wachsmann-Hogiu (Facility Director of the NSF Science and Technology Center and Associate Professor of Pathology at UC Davis), and Judith Van Houten (University Distinguished Professor at the University of Vermont and Director of Vermont INBRE) met on September 14 and 15, 2011 on the Boise State University Campus to review the proposed PhD Program in Biomolecular Sciences. This team was provided with the INBRE proposal and external evaluation report of INBRE, 2008 Memorandum to Dr. Jack Pelton, Graduate College Dean, about the Organizational Structure for the PhD in Biomolecular Sciences and the 2011 proposal to the Idaho State Board of Education. On September 14, the team met with administrators (Dr. Tony Roark (Interim Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences), Dr. Martin Schimpf (the Provost and VP for Academic Affairs), Dr. Carolyn Bohach (the PI of the Idaho INBRE grant), Dr. Jack Pelton (Dean of the Graduate College), Dr. Mark Rudin (VP for Research), Dr. Marilyn Moody (Dean University Library), (Vice President for Finance), Dr. James Munger (Vice Provost for Academic Planning), Chairs of Biology, Chemistry and Physics Departments, Dr. C. Daniels and Dr. Mark Thomas of ISU (by phone), 6 faculty, and 11 graduate students. The team also met with Michael Hill (Boise Technology), Steve Lackie (Sapidyne), Theodore Walters (St. Luke's Mou ntain States Tumor and Medical Research Institute), Christopher Ball (Idaho Department of Health and Welfare). See full agenda attached. The review team toured facilities and faculty laboratories: four in Chemistry, five in Biology and two in Physics. ATTACHMENT 3 IRSA TAB 1 Page 52 2 On September 15, the team composed its report and made a presentation to Drs. Munger, Pelton, Roark, Schimpf, Wingett, Hanna and LeMaster. C. Readiness Boise State University is a rapidly growing university serving a large metropolitan area of more than half million people. The strategic location of the University in the Treasure Valley with a VA and other diagnosis and treatment centers, as well as a high number of small and large businesses will most likely support further developments within individual schools and colleges. The College of Arts and Sciences, through INBRE and other funding mechanisms, has made significant strategic investments over the last 8 years towards a full PhD program in the field of biomolecular sciences. This field has seen major advances nationally and internationally as it has the potential to help understand basic mechanisms of disease, diagnose disease, and provide treatments. Biomolecular science, as it encompasses several disciplines such as biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering, requires a unique interdisciplinary approach that can be effective only in settings where a collaborative environment is created, and faculty from different departments have the possibility to interact and work together on a daily basis. The establishment of collaborative research networks is the goal of the NIH- funded INBRE program. During our visit to BSU, we particularly looked into various aspects of the environment within the College of Arts and Sciences, to evaluate their readiness for a PhD program in the field of biomolecular sciences . 1. Facilities. Over the past 8 years BSU has acquired a large number of state- of-the- art instruments for research in this field. Basic analytical instruments as well as dedicated instruments are available to perform the proposed fundamental and applied research, and faculty members seem to have adequate lab space for their work. A new vivarium to be built with funding from the NIH will further add value to the program, as it will allow for time-sensitive research to be performed directly at the University. Overall, facilities are comparable with those at research-intensive, PhD- granting institutions and we think that they are suitable for the proposed PhD program. 2. Faculty. We would like to congratulate the chairs of the three departments participating in this program for their leadership and hard work in bringing together faculty from their departments and significantly contributing to the advancement of this program. We were highly impressed by the quality and enthusiasm of the faculty. We were amazed that they are able to perform nationally competitive research with only masters degree students. ATTACHMENT 3 IRSA TAB 1 Page 53 3 Participating faculty are already engaged in research projects that are related to the proposed program, and received significant extramural funding as detailed in the proposal. They also currently offer a large number of courses that are specific to the program and could easily be incorporated into the new curriculum. One major hurdle in implementing such interdisciplinary programs is bringing the faculty from different departments to work together. From our discussions with the faculty is seemed very obvious that they are already working together on interdisciplinary projects. In addition, they actively collaborate with faculty in other departments such as material sciences, kinesiology, as well as VA medical center and other medical programs in the region. There are also active collaborations with faculty at the other two Idaho Universities. Overall, we think that the faculty are well prepared and already performing research and teaching comparable to national research intensive institutions. However, to take their research to the next level of competitiveness, they need a strong PhD program. 3. Administrative support. BSU administration appears to be as enthusiastic about this program as the faculty and students. Over the past 8 years, they have lived up to their commitment to the INBRE program to make strategic faculty hires in interdisciplinary areas. This was specifically preparatory to the development of the PhD program. They have also been supportive for graduate stipends and technical support. The chairs of the participating department are also fully supportive to this program. 4. Community support. There seems to be very strong community support, as evidenced by letters of support and our direct conversations. Michael Hill (Boise Technology), Steve Lackie (Sapidyne), Theodore Walters (St. Luke's Mou ntain States Tumor and Medical Research Institute), Christopher Ball (Idaho Department of Health and Welfare) reiterated their support for an interdisciplinary PhD program in the area that would satisfy their needs for highly trained personnel. D. Recommendations The review team recommends that the PhD program be implemented as soon as possible. All of the component parts, faculty, facilities and technical assistance are in place. There is high demand for the program from the current MS students, who will contribute to a successful beginning for the program because they are well trained and understand collaborative research. The majority of graduate students interviewed by the review team showed interest in a PhD program and almost all of them expressed the desire to do their research at BSU if at all possible. The review team recommends that the following be implemented as the new program evolves in its early years: 1. Equal co- advisors from different disciplines relevant to the each student's research should be approved by the Steering Committee. ATTACHMENT 3 IRSA TAB 1 Page 54 4 2. The program should develop a student-centric approach and trust in the student and co-advisors. This allows the curriculum requirements beyond the three required core courses to be left to the co-advisors and student, who together will develop a program of courses that are designed to prepare the student for truly interdisciplinary research. The \"track\" approach to the courses beyond the core should be abandoned and replaced with selection by the advisors with the students, perhaps with approval of the Steering Committee. Courses from outside the College of Arts and Sciences will undoubtedly be needed for many of the students' training. 3. The richness of the pool of potential advisors for the program was not apparent from the formal proposal. However, the review team's interviews with faculty reveal ed that there are many interdisciplinary projects in the Biology, Chemistry and Physics Departments connecting faculty from these departments to others across the campus. The mathematicians, engineers, kinesiologists and others who are key collaborators with the program faculty listed in the proposal should be recognized as \"affiliate\" faculty. The program should be opened up to these faculty and others across the campus, the VA and other health care entities, and other campuses, who ca n contribute to the training of interdisciplinary graduate students. Importantly, it should be possible for faculty at UI and ISU to participate as affiliate faculty and train graduate students as a co-advisor. 4. The review team recommends that incoming students be required to do two to three rotations in the first year in research laboratories involving more than one discipline as a mechanism of locating the most appropriate labs and advisors for interdisciplinary training. 5. A liaison between the Biomolecular Sciences PhD Program and the Materials Science PhD Program should be established. This will promote synergy and allow the programs to become complementary rather than competitive. 6. The retention, promotion and tenure guidelines should be carefully considered b y the administration at all levels so that faculty who carry out interdisciplinary, collaborative research are not at a disadvantage. E. Relationship to other Idaho Graduate Program . Both the University of Idaho and Idaho State have successful graduate programs that are organized within single departments or single disciplines. There are PhD programs in Biology, Microbiology / Molecular Biology / Biochemistry, Biological and Agricultural Engineering, and Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at the University of Idaho. Idaho State offers the PhD in Pharmacy, Pharmaceutical Sciences, Microbiology, and Biology. These types of discipline based graduate training programs have been the norm in this country since at least the 1950's. Such programs will continue to play an important role in training specialist within the existing biomedical disciplines. However, ATTACHMENT 3 IRSA TAB 1 Page 55 5 there is an increasing synergy between biomedical and applied science, physics, and engineering, which has been largely the result of advancements in nanotechnology, requires more broadly trained investigators. The term \"interdisciplinary\" no longer means training that crosses the boundaries between departments with the biological science disciplines such as biology, microbiology, and biochemistry. The term now means crossing the boundaries between the life sciences, physical sciences, medicine, a nd engineering. There are no existing graduate programs in Idaho that do this. Thus, as the only truly interdisciplinary program in Idaho, this proposed program would fill a major void in graduate training for the state. A major strength of this program is the role it can play in fostering collaboration between faculty at the 3 Idaho research universities. National funding agencies have recognized the importance of multi-investigator and multi-institutional interdisciplinary research teams for tackling significant biomedical research problems. The fraction of total grant money going to these types of projects has been increasing and will continue to increase in the future. The Idaho BRIN and INBRE programs have made considerable progress toward promoting interactions between investigators at the 3 universities. The proposed graduate program was listed as a deliverable in the INBRE proposals and is an important component in the goal of developing nationally competitive research teams in the IDEA states that in aggregate receive less than 5% of total NIH research funds. This will be the first broadly interdisciplinary graduate program. As such, it can act as a nexus for interdisciplinary research collaborations among the state universities. The development of these collaborations will be critical for Idaho to succeed in the competition with other states for research and infrastructure dollars. Both the faculty and the administrators at Boise State were very receptive to the committee's suggestion that the graduate program be open to participation by faculty from The University of Idaho and Idaho State. They were also receptive to the idea that outside faculty could serve as graduate student advisors and, as the program develops, have students working in their laboratories. This would be an ideal outcome for this program if it could ultimately tap the intellectual resources of the state university system. There would no doubt be administrative barriers to extending the program to the other institutions over the near term. So it would seem to be in the best interest of the other institutions for this program to succeed at Boise State. We know from our conversations with representatives from the biomedical devices and biotechnology sector in Boise that the unique inter disciplinary training of the program's graduates will make them ideal employees. Thus, the PhD program will also contribute to the state's economic developm ent. The NIH has made it clear that the future focus of research funding will be directe d toward translational research, which is a process that will move discoveries from the laboratory bench to clinical application as quickly as possible. Establishing this PhD program at Boise State will allow Idaho faculty to conduct translational research as well as train a cadre of new investigators who will be particularly qualified to conduct this type of research. The program will facilitate translational research, despite the ATTACHMENT 3 IRSA TAB 1 Page 56 6 absence of a medical school in Idaho. According to the Appendix material and conversations we had with representatives from health care institutions, they are very eager to collaborate with faculty and students at the Idaho universities. In order for Idaho to remain competitive for NIH funding, it is essential for its researchers to establish and maintain interactions with the medical facilities in the state. Because Boise is the home of the major medical facilities in the state, BSU faculty are in the best position for establishing these relationships. A PhD program with a strong biomedical emphasis will be a major step toward growing research collaborations with the existing medical institutions. Biomedical research at Boise State is limited by the absence of a PhD program. Establishment of this program would move their research to the next level of national competitiveness, which should allow them develop local translational research collaborations. Researchers from the University of Idaho and Idaho State would benefit from such opportunities to conduct translational research either through participation in the graduate program or peer- to-peer collaborations. ATTACHMENT 3 IRSA TAB 1 Page 50 APPENDIX A2: Doctor of Philosophy in Biomolecular Sciences Boise State University Response to External Program Review Report ATTACHMENT 3 IRSA TAB 1 Page 58Revised 5-5-2010 51 RESPONSE to the Site Visit Report for the proposed Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Biomolecular Sciences at Boise State University College of Arts and Sciences Departments of Biological Sciences, Chemistry & Biochemistry, and Physics September 20, 2011 Site Visit Report authors (external reviewers): Judith Van Houten, University of Vermont Sebastian Wachsmann-Hogiu, University of California, Davis Lee Weber, University of Nevada, Reno A. Response to the executive summary We are in complete agreement with the executive summary. Great care was taken in the design of the Biomolecular Sciences PhD program to ensure that it would be truly interdisciplinary and collaborative (interweaving Biology, Chemistry, and Physics), and that it would not duplicate other PhD programs in Idaho. A key benefit for the State of Idaho is that it will increase the ability of BSU to collaborate with UI, ISU, and state and federal agencies (such as the Veteran's Administration), and to contribute in important areas of research that will benefit the State of Idaho and all of its universities. Another major educational and economic benefit to the State of Idaho is that it will help meet the needs of companies in Idaho for highly trained personnel, and contribute to providing future employment opportunities for Idaho citizens. B. Response to Readiness We are in complete agreement with the Readiness section of the report. Boise State University has almost a decade of preparation for this PhD program, including strategic faculty hiring, acquisition of sophisticated research instrumentation and development of laboratory facilities, and the growth of research collaborations and extramural funding, as outlined in the site visit report. This proposed PhD program is widely supported by the faculty, the departments, the administration, and by the larger community. C. Response to recommendations We agree with the spirit of all of the recommendations made in the site visit report, although there are some differences in the specific implementation that warrant discussion. We address the specific recommendations (summarized in italics) one at a time, below. 1. Equal co- advisors from different disciplines relevant to the each student's research should be approve d by the Steering Committee. We agree that the students' PhD dissertation research should involve the input and perspectives from faculty of different disciplines, and that dissertation co-advisors can be a useful way to ensure the multi- disciplinary na ture of the program and student's research. Fortunately, BSU already allows co -advising in ATTACHMENT 3 IRSA TAB 1 Page 59Revised 5-5-2010 52 graduate programs, including at the PhD level. The proposed PhD program will implement an approval process, in collaboration with the Graduate College, to facilitate and encourage dissertation co-advising. We will also help meet this goal by requiring each student's dissertation committee to include at least one faculty member from each of the three key departments (Biological Sciences, Chemistry and Biochemistry, and Physics). In addition, committee members from outside these three departments and from outside the university (e.g., Veterans Administration, and other Idaho institutions of higher learning) will also be allowed to serve on the dissertation committee, upon appointment as affiliate faculty members of the program. 2. The program should develop a student-centric approach and trust in the student and coadvisors. This allows the curriculum requirements beyond the three required core courses to be left to the co-advisors and student, who together will develop a program of c ourses that are designed to prepare the student for truly interdisciplinary research. The \"track\" approach to the courses beyond the core should be abandoned and replaced with selection by the advisors with the students, perhaps with approval of the Steering Committee. Courses from outside the Coll ege of Arts and Sciences will undoubtedly be needed for many of the students' training. We strongly agree that flexibility in courses and research collaborators is important for this interdisciplinary program, and understand and respect the recommendation of the external review team. The review team raises an important concern, that defining specific tracks could have the unintended consequence of making the proposed PhD program less interdisciplinary and less collaborative across departments. This is an issue that the program design committee recognized in its deliberations as having two key aspects : (1) the program must be sufficiently flexible to accommodate a wide variety of interdisciplinary biomolecular research projects, yet (2) the program must be sufficiently rigorous in its courses and training to ensure that all students obtain a solid foundation in Cell and Molecular Biology, Biochemistry, and Biophysics, the foundation disciplines for an informed interdisciplinary education in the Biomolecular Sciences. The program design committee also sought to avoid creating a \"big tent\" PhD program that would be so minimal in its structure and academic requirements that it could end up housing a collection of several de facto single- discipline PhD programs under the guise of \"Biomolecular Sciences\", instead of meeting the intended goal of creating a single, coherent interdisciplinary PhD program. The recommendation of the external review team to revisit the curriculum and abolish the tracks has been a catalyst for further serious reflection. We have concluded that the best way to meet the recommendations of the review team and the original goals of the program design committee is to take the following actions: (1) keep the core courses (as recommended by the review team); (2) eliminate the formality of tracks (also as recommended by the review team); (3) allow students to take elective courses outside the College of Arts and Sciences (as recommended by the review team), and (4) require that all students take the Advanced Cell Biology (BIOL 611) and one Biophysics course (PHYS 611 or 612) to ensure the proper breadth of fundamental background courses. These curricular changes are easily made by the university; they open the curriculum considerably, allow a greater choice of electives, and significantly streamline the program design. 3. The richness of the pool of potential advisors for the program was not apparent from the formal proposal. However, the review team's interviews with faculty revealed that there are many interdisciplinary projects in the Biology, Chemistry, and Physics Departments connecting faculty from these departments to others across the campus. The mathematicians, engineers, kinesiologists, and others who are key collaborators with the program faculty listed in the proposal should be recognized as ATTACHMENT 3 IRSA TAB 1 Page 60Revised 5-5-2010 53 \"affiliate\" faculty. The program should be opened up to these faculty and ot hers across the campus, the VA and other health care entities, and other campuses, who can contribute to the training of interdisciplinary graduate students. Importantly, it should be possible for faculty at UI and ISU to participate as affiliate faculty and train graduate students as a co-advisor. We strongly agree with this recommendation, and note that faculty from other disciplines, and researchers from outside the university, are currently allowed and encouraged to serve on dissertation committees in existing BSU graduate programs, including researchers from the Boise VA Medical Center and other research entities, as well as faculty from other Idaho Universities. The proposed three departments within the Biomolecular Sciences PhD program will make use of the existing approval process, in collaboration with the Graduate College, for appointing affiliate faculty members. The appointment of affiliate faculty members will allow researchers from outside the three departments and outside of BSU, to serve on dissertation committees, and, where warranted, to act as co-advisors, upon approval of the program. Such affiliate program members, will also be required to have appointments as affiliate faculty members in at least one of the three departments (Biological Sciences, Chemistry and Biochemistry, or Physics). 4. The review team recommends that incoming students be required to do two to three rotations in the first year in research laboratories involving more than one discipline as a mechanism of locating the most appropriate labs and advisors for interdisciplinary training. We agree wholeheartedly with this recommendation. The three departments will work together to implement a requirement of 3 ten-week rotations for all first-year students in the program. 5. A liaison between the Biomolecular Sciences PhD Program and the Materials Science PhD Program should be established. This will promote synergy and allow the programs to become complementary rather than competitive. We agree that establishing a liaison between the two PhD programs would reinforce the synergy, and encourage greater cooperation, between the two programs. We anticipate that there will be significant synergy and research collaborations between the two programs, based on the extent of the existing research and academic collaborations between the faculty members of both proposed programs. Indeed, several researchers will be faculty members in one PhD program, and affiliate members in the other, and will therefore be able to be supervisors or dissertation committee members in both programs. 6. The retention, promotion and tenure guidelines should be carefully considered by the administration at all levels so that faculty who carry out interdisciplinary, collaborative research are not at a disadvantage. We agree that the issue of pr omotion and tenure requires special attention for faculty members carrying out interdisciplinary research that involves multiple departments. A key issue is that different departments typically have significantly different expectations for promotion and tenure, and it is unreasonable to expect a faculty member to meet multiple and widely varying tenure requirements. In order to address this potential difficulty, the faculty lines of each tenured or tenu re-track faculty member in this program will reside in one of the three departments (Biological Sciences, Chemistry and Biochemistry, or Physics), even in the case of joint appointments, and the faculty member will be responsible for meeting the tenure and promotion comments of the department in which their faculty line resides. The tenure- granting depa rtment will solicit input on the faculty member's research from all the departments in which the faculty member has an appointment or significant research collaborations. ATTACHMENT 3 IRSA TAB 1 Page 61Revised 5-5-2010 54 D. Relationship to other Idaho Graduate Programs We are in complete agreement with external review committee's description of the relationship between the proposed PhD program in Biomolecular Sciences and existing Idaho graduate programs. The proposed Biomolecular Sciences PhD program is uniquely interdisciplinary in Idaho, in that it crosses department (Biology, Chemistry, and Physics) and disciplinary (life sciences, physical sciences, biomedicine, and engineering) boundaries in a way, and to an extent, that is not done elsewhere in the state. The establishment of this program will expand and deepen research collaborations across the state, especially between Idaho's three public universities, and will make Idaho more competitive for statewide research infrastructure grants. Indeed, the creation of the proposed Biomolecular Sciences PhD program at BSU was one of the key deliverables Idaho's successful INBRE proposals, which was funded by the NIH and which benefitted all the public universities and colleges in the state.

Munger, PhD Vice Provost for Academic Planning Boise State University Boise, ID 83725 Re: New Biomolecular Sciences Ph D at Boise State University Dear Vice Provost Munger, I am pleased to hear that Boise State is pursuing a new doctorate program in Biomolecular Sciences. I understand this interd isciplinary degree option is designed to meet the needs of students seeking post-graduate educati on in biochemistry, bioinformatics, biophysics, cell biology, and molecular biology. This program will benefit Boise in many ways, but here are the most obvious to this mayor. Its students will be Boiseans while pursuing th eir degrees, contributing both economically and culturally to \"the most livable city in th e country.\" Many graduates will remain in the area, adding to our skilled workforce, adva ncing our existing biomedical enterprises and starting new ones. It is fact that higher-education rese arch has a positive economic multiplier effect in its host city and far beyond. The City of Boise and I support your efforts and wish you good fortune. Sincerely, David H. Bieter Mayor ATTACHMENT 3 IRSA TAB 1 Page 642270 Old Penitentiary Road P.O.

As you know, BSU has a long tradition of recruiting some of Idaho's best talent and keeping those individuals in th e state where they are most needed. There is no doubt that a highly- skilled and well-educated work force is one of the greatest assets to Idaho's economy and way of life. Specifically, biomolecular studies have great potential to positively affect the Idaho State Department of Agriculture's mission of preven ting, monitoring and controlling pests and diseases. Moreover, agriculture as a whole stands to benefit from bio-science researc h. Agriculture has been a driving cultural and economic force in Idaho for generations , and it is a dynamic, e volving industry greatly enhanced by efforts in dozens of fields. Synergy be tween agriculture and research has paved the way for incredible advancements in Idaho, and I am confident that innovation will continue to help drive Idaho's success in markets domestically and around the world. Biomolecular studies have the potenti al to benefit far more than just one industry sector. Time after time, businesses seeking to expand in or relocate to Id aho look at the work force available in the state and the quality of life enjoyed here. Greater educational opport unities serve both of these areas. Additionally, a Ph.D program does not simply of fer an outlet for student s seeking educational advancement. A science-based doctorate degree option represents a real and ta ngible venue for solving problems that interface dozens of fields. Idahoans already possess tremendous work ethic a nd drive to succeed. Now we need to empower them with additional opportun ities to thrive. I appreciate the opportunity to bring to light the many ways that a biomolecular science doctorate program will benefit al l of Idaho. I hope this program proposal receives positive consideration.

Munger, PhD Vice Provost for Academic Planning Boise State University Boise, ID 83725 208-426-4010 Dear Dr. Munger, As you are aware Boise Technology, Inc is a small high -tech research company located in the Boise valley. In fact, about half of our technical staff is Ph.D. scientists. Although most of our work is in the area of physical chemistry we do currently have one project with a biomolecular focus and we would like to develop more. We are even currently searching for Ph.D. biologist/biochemist/biomolecular scientist to fill an opening in our organization. It would b e wonderful if we had a local candidate pool to choose from to fill this position but instead we will most likely have to fill the position from outside the local community. It would be favorable to us if BSU were to have a PH.D. program in Biomolecular Sciences, for developing a local candidate pool as well as for establishing greater collaboration potential between us and the university. I also beli eve that developing a successful biomolecular program would benefit the establishment of other Ph.D . programs in the sciences at BSU. And this would also be of great value to us. The bachelor's level scientists that we hire are usually intelligent and driven. We have lost a few of our brightest junior level scientists to graduate schools out of state. We would welcome more local graduate programs tha t might help us to retain our brightest with the opportunity to enroll in a local graduate progra m. I am very glad to see that BSU is committed to continue to develop new graduate programs in the sciences, and to ret ain or recruit the brightest and the best to the local community. Please always strive to e nhance the capabilities of Boise State University. It will enhance the community. Best rega rds, Michael W.

Sawyer, Ph.D. May 2011 ATTACHMENT 3 IRSA TAB 1 Page 89 2 Proceed expeditiously with approval and fundi ng the Ph.D. Program in Interdisciplinary Biomolecular Sciences at BSU. Providing strong, inter-institutional support for the implementation of BSU's Ph.D. Program as befitting an institution on the threshold of achieving research intensive status. This is a \"win-win\" opportunity for all Ida ho institutions, and is necessary for the continued success of INBRE and its sustainability. The Committee was particularly impressed by the developing inte rdisciplinary biomolecular research program at B o i s e S t a t e U n i v e r s i t y . I f a p proved by the appropriate authorities, the Interdisciplinary Biomolecular Sciences Ph.D. Program would be unique in the State, including researchers and student s from biology, chemistry, engineering and other disciplines. The Committee no ted the University's commitment of scarce resources to support this program. Moreov er, it is essential for sustaining the research mome ntum in the Boise area after NI H INBRE funding sunsets. BSU is progressing toward becoming a Carnegie Mellon designated R e s e a r c h Intensive University. Critical to maintaining this momentum is the approval and implementation of the Biomolecul a r S c i e n c e s P h . D . P r o g r a m . T h i s would be a unique interdisciplinary program, and would clearly complement and enhance the existing Ph.D. programs at UI and ISU. The potential for interinstitutional collaborations between these programs is outstanding.

The undergraduate will use NIR models and remote sensing capabilities to develop models that can predict the dietary quality of sagebrush in the field. These models will provide a rapid, predictable tool to define and assess shifts in the nutritional and chemical attributes of plants ac ross landscapes related to changes in climate . Award Nutritional and chemical quality of winter diets selected by sage -grouse This research will investi gate both nutritional and chemical factors that drive selection of sagebrush for food by sage-grouse during the winter. The ultimate goal is to identify functional habitat use by sage-grouse and will provide land managers with insight based on nutritional ecology of sage- grouse that will compliment existing efforts to conserve and restore quality sagebrush habitat.

Other Un-refereed Works 1. BaseFinder Version 6. Downloadable from http://bioinfo.med.unc.edu/Downloads/index.html. This software was originally developed by me from 1991-1997 while a graduate student in Dr. Lloyd Smith's lab at UW-Madison, bringing it to version 5. Development was resumed in 2005 by my lab, after beginning a collaboration with Dr. Kevin Weeks, UNC Chemistry Dept. We have thoroughly updated the software, xed substantial bugs, signicantly enhanced the user interface, and added new processing/analysis tools for analysis of RNA structure data produced by SHAPE chemistry, resulting in Version 6. It is in extensive use by the Weeks lab, and there is substantial interest in the community for this tool once the SHAPE-capable version is released. This development effort is supported by an R01 grant AI068462 (Weeks, PI). 2. Genome-based peptide Fingerprint Scanning (GFS), Version 2. http://gfs.unc.edu. Version 2, released June 2007, represents a substantial upgrade to the software, including: Capability for large-genome processing, analysis of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data, cluster- page 6 ATTACHMENT 3 IRSA TAB 1 Page 164distribution capability, shotgun/bottom-up data analysis, many bug xes, a new user interface on our website, and more. Over 40,000 lines of code. We have had strong interest from many groups since its announcement, 3 of whom are now using it (in Washington state, France, and California). This software development is supported by an R01 grant, RR20823 (Giddings, PI). 3. Protein Cleavage and Modication Engine. http://proclame.unc.edu. Released 2004. This software predicts post-translational modications on proteins from intact mass spectrometry data. Since original publication in Analytical Chemistry, software has undergone numerous improvements in user interface, usability, flexibility, and speed. We also have developed a standalone version that can be used as part of a high-throughput pipeline at the request of collaborators at Pacic Northwest National Laboratories. The next version is being worked on, and will incorporate use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. 4. Genome-based peptide Fingerprint Scanning (GFS), Version 1. http://gfs.unc.edu. Version 1 provided a novel means for identifying proteins from mass spectrometry data, by directly searching whole genome sequences, bypassing the limitations (or absence of) annotations. However, it had several limitations: it could only process peptide mass ngerprint data, it could only work on small genomes (yeast or smaller), and was not cluster capable. Nontheless, there was substantial interest and use in the community.

(iv) Research Experiences Dr. Kim's research is focused on molecular scale investigation of bio -molecular systems such as proteins, DNAs, cells, and bacteria using various scanning probe techniques including COIFM, STM, AFM, and MFM . The \"cantilever based optical interfacial force microscope,\" is a special scanning probe microscope r ecently developed by Dr. Kim for biophysics research at Boise State University. Kim's group currently uses the COIFM for investigating phase transition of interfacial water , which is important in understanding biomolecular systems such as antifreeze proteins. The instrument is also used to probe the metastable states of molecular interactions between two biomolecules. This resea rch is funded from National Science Foundation. Another current research project that Dr. Kim is conduct ing is the investigation of organic molecular recognitions in electrochemical environments by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The competitive role s of intermolecular and adsorbate- substrate interactions in molecular ordering is a subject currently being studied using STM. Another project is the study of an enzyme system, 5-methyl thioadenosine/s-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase (MTAN) extracted from Escherichia coli, by measuring a biomolecular stabilization constant using a novel atomic force microscope ( AFM ) technique. Kim's group is also studying the relationship between topography and magnetic structures by a recently developed magnetic force microscope that employs a novel electrostatic force modulation.

Polina Kokoulina (listed as co-author on published manuscript) I have also served on numerous Thesis committees for students in other labs in our biology department Formal Teaching Activities Past three years. 1) Instructor for Biol. 442/542 (Molecular Neurobiology) at Boise State University. This is a molecula r neurobiology course for under - and graduate -students. Responsible for teaching all lectures, exam preparations, and grading. This is an intensive upper division course that most students find very challenging. The one aspect of this course that I try t o do most is keep current with the most recent advancements in particular topics. 2) Instructor for Biol. 431/531 (Pharmacology) at Boise State University. This is a pharmacology course for both graduate and undergraduate students. All areas of pharma cology are covered. This is an interesting course as far as the students go. I typically have a wide- range of students enrolled in this course with various majors including pre -nursing, premedical, pre - pharmacy, pre -dental, biology etc. I try to teach t his course at the level first year medical students. It is an extremely challenging course in terms of content and pace. 3) Instructor for Biol. 100 (Concepts of Biology) at Boise State University. This is a non - majors course covering all aspects of bi ology. A two- hour weekly lab to enforce concepts taught in class was also given. I am responsible for all aspects of this class. This is a service course for our department and typically the class size is large (greater than 200 students) and encompasses students who are not science majors. 4) Instructor for Biol. 100 (Electronic Course) at Boise State University. This is the online version the same course that I teach face- to-face. I was one of the original faculty members involved with the pilot blac kboard program and was the first faculty member to develop and teach an online course for our department.

Major Research Interest s: Our laboratory is interested in the role that certain proteases play in promoting the pathology associated with different neurodegenerative diseases. For example, in Alzheimer's disease, our lab has investigated the role that caspases may play in promo ting neurofibrillary tangle formation. In this regard, we hypothesize that the caspase- cleavage of the microtubule- associated protein, tau, may be the link between senile plaques and tangles observed in this disease. We have developed a novel transgenic mouse model of AD that overexpresses the anti- apoptotic protein, Bcl-2 and have demonstrated that such overexpression prevents plaque and tangle formation and improves cognition. More recently, we are beginning to assess the ability of caspase inhibitors in preventing Alzheimer's disease pathology in an aggressive transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's.
