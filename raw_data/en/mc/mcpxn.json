FERRARA THOMAS MORE SOCIETY 148-29 Cross Island Parkway Whitestone, Queens NY 11357 MICHAEL MCHALE THOMAS MORE SOCIETY 10506 Burt Circle, Suite 110 Omaha, NE 68114 Counsel for Petitioner s QUESTION S PRESENTED Using its emergency regulatory powers, New York has imposed a COVID vaccine mandate on healthcare workers , but provided no religious exemption. Work- ers who are unvaccinated for religious reasons are ex- cluded from the workplace. By contrast, healthcare workers remaining unvacc inated for medical reasons are permitted to continue in -person healthcare work \u2014 often in the same facilities, doing the same jobs, and carrying the same claimed risk as the terminated reli- gious objectors. New York even allows vaccinated workers with active and symptomatic infections to continue working, but not healthy religious objectors . New York's approach deviates from virtually every other state and the federal government, which con- tinue to allow unvaccinated religious objectors to pro- vide in -person hea lthcare. The question s presented are: 1. Whether an administrative rule that targets and forbids religious conduct, while permit ting otherwise identical secular conduct , is permissible under the Free Exercise Clause. 2. Whether Employment Division v. Smith should be overruled. ii PARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING S AND CORPORATE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 29.6, Petitioners Dr. A., Nurse A ., Dr. C., Nurse D ., Dr. F., Dr. G., Ther- apist I ., Dr. J., Nurse J ., Dr. M., Nurse N ., Dr. O., Dr. P., Dr. S., Nurse S ., and Physician Liaison X . were plaintiffs below in proceedings before both the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York . Technologist P ., who was a party to the case below, moved to a state with no vaccine mandate and is no longer part of the lawsuit. T hey each represent that they do not have any parent entities and do not issue stock. Respondents are Kathy Hochul, in her official ca- pacity as G overnor of the State of New York, Dr. How- ard Zucker , in his official capacity as Commissioner of the New York State Department of Health, and Letitia James, in her official capacity as the Attorney General of the State of New York. Dr. Zucker has been repl aced as Commissioner of the New York State Department of Health by Dr. Mary T. Bassett. iii RELATED PROCEEDINGS The Petitioners in this case filed an Emergency Ap- plication for Writ of Injunction or, in the alternative, Petition for Writ of Certiorari and Stay Pending Reso- lution , 552 (2021). The ap- plication was denied by the Court on December 13, 2021 . Justice Thomas would have granted the applica- tion. Justice Gorsuch , with whom Justice Alito joined, dissented from the denial of application for injunctive relief. Before the Second Circuit, this case was consoli- dated with We the Patriots, Inc. v. Hochul , No. 21 - 2179, a different set of plaintiffs challenging the same mandate. We the Patriots, Inc. v. Hochul , No. 21 -2179 (2d Cir.)

The district court rightly held that the mandate is \"not a neutral law,\" but a \"'religious gerrymander'\" that \"tar- gets religious opposition to the available COVID -19 vaccines.\" The Second Circuit recognized that New York's mandate allows other unvaccinated workers to keep working , while religious objectors must be ex- pelled from the workplace . And it acknowledged th at Petitioners are therefore subject to \"meaningful bur- dens on their religious practice .\" Yet the S econd Circuit denied relief because it found those \"meaningful burdens \" on a constitutional right were just \"not of a constitutional dimension .\" That is egregious error . If a written Bill of Rights means anything , it is that \"meaningful burdens\" on constit utional \"of a constitutional dimen- sion.\" The Second Circuit's misguided approach is the re- sult of deep and harmful confusion in the lower courts about how to apply the Free Exercise Clause. While it ought to have been straightforward after Fulton and Tandon to recognize that secular exemptions in New York's law defeat general applicability, the Second Circuit exacerbat ed existing splits by following opin- ions from other circuits that have badly misconstrued the Free Exercise Clause, including the heavily criti- cized decisions in 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis , 746 Fed. Appx. 709 S. Ct. 2433 (2016) (No. 15 -862) (Alito, J., dissenting). The 2 Second Circuit somehow found New York's policy ne u- tral and generally applicable , discounting the inten- tional removal of a religious exemption (but not oth- ers), the outlawing of religious accommodations (but not others) , and the Governor 's direct attacks on reli- gious objectors from the pulpit. By any plausible understanding of the Free Exer- cise Clause, New York's vaccine mandate should have faced serious constitutional scrutiny. Yet the existing doctrinal confusion allowed the Second Circuit to up- hold, on mere rational basis review, an extreme m an- date that is a harmful national outlier. While 47 states and the federal government agree they can accommo- date religious objectors, New York punishes them . Ten Petitioners are among the 37,000 New York healthcare workers to lose their jobs. Five Petition ers and likely many other workers have submitted to vac- cinations under protest, at incalculable harm to their fundamental rights. All of this occurred because of the admittedly \"intentional\" withdrawal of religious ex- emptions , and all while other unvaccina ted workers have kept working the same jobs from which religious objectors were terminated. New York's approach is therefore nothing like the \"across -the-board\" law in Smith that only \"inci- dentally\" burdened religion, and New York should eas- ily have triggered and failed strict scrutiny under Ful- ton, Tandon , and Smith . That it did not simply con- firms the depth of confusion in the lower courts over how to apply the Free Exercis e Clause. This confusion has generated conflicting decisions over the specific is- sue of vaccine mandates with secular exemptions. Compare Dahl v. Board of Trustees of Western Michi-3 gan University , 15 F.4th 728 16 F.4th 20 (1st Cir. 2021) , and Doe v. San Diego Unified School District , 22 F.4th 1099 (9th Cir. filed Dec. 10, 2021) . Millions of Americans are now subject to COVID vaccine mandates. These mandates affect nearly every aspect of life and have spawned scores of lawsuits around the country , and dozens o f emergency applica- tions to this Court. The Court recently decided two ex- pedited cases concerning the scope of federal govern- ment power to impose vaccine mandates in the context of OSHA regulation and CMS funding . See NFIB v. Department of Labor , 142 S. Ct. 661 (2022); Biden v. Missouri , 142 S. Ct. 647 ( 2022) . State and local vaccine mandates raise equally important questions of indi- vidual liberty and, as discussed below, those questions are generating confusion and disagreement in the lower courts and across the Nation. To be sure, like the COVID worship case s, the vac- cine mandate cases raise difficult questions about bal- ancing indubitably strong public health interests on one side and core constitutional rights on the other. Where those difficult questions intersect with reli- gious liberty, they ought to be de cided according to clear free exercise standards rooted in the Constitu- tion and articulated by this Court. Two years into the pandemic, certiorari is warranted to clarify core free exercise principles , for COVID cases and beyond .

Factual Background A. New York's Mandate On August 18, 2021, former Governor Andrew Cuomo announced a vaccine mandate for healthcare workers , with the stated goal of \" prevent [ing] the spread of the Delta variant.\"1 That mandate included 1 App. 127a; N.Y. State Governor's Office, Governor Cuomo An- nounces COVID -19 Vaccination Mandate for Healthcare Workers (Aug. 16, 2021), https://perma.cc/ZBP3 -Y778. 5 express religious and medical exemptions. The reli- gious exemption provided that \"[c]overed entities shall grant a religious exemption for COVID -19 vaccination for covered personnel if they hold a genuine and sin- cere religious belief\" contrary to COVID vaccination . App. 131a . The medical exemption applied if \"any li- censed physician or certified nurse practitioner certi- fie[d]\" that receiving a vaccine would be \"detrimental\" based a \"specific pre -existing health condit ion,\" \"only until\" the vaccine is no longer \"detrimental to the health\" of that employee. App. 130a . Eight days later, New York announced a new ver- sion of its mandate . App.133a. This version of the mandate eliminated the religious exemption . Ibid. It also broadened the medical exemption : making the mandate entirely \"inapplicable\" to the medically ex- empt instead of just allowing \"reasonable accommoda- tion,\" and removing the limitation that exemption is only available for \"specific\" conditions. Compare App. 130a -131a with App. 135a -136a . Aside from the medical exemption, the mandate applies to all \"per- sonnel \" at covered entities . \"Personnel \" is defined as healthcare workers who \" engage in activities \" where \"they could potentially expose other covered person- nel, patients or residents\" to COVID if infected. App. 134a . Governor Kathy Hochul explained at a news con- ference that the religious exemption was \"left off\" of the new version of the mandate and that this omission was done \"intentionally.\"2 She exp lained that she was 2 N.Y. State Governor's Office, Governor Hochul Holds Q&A Following COVID -19 Briefing (Sept. 15, 2021), https://perma.cc/5DY6 -S7KM. 6 not aware of a \"sanctioned religious exemption from any organized religion\" and that \"everybody from the Pope on down is encouraging people to get vaccinated.\" Ibid. In September, Governor Hochul spoke at two church services, publicly condemning religious objec- tors from the pulpit . At one, she explained : \"[God] made them come up with a vaccine. That is from God to us and we must say, thank you, God.\"3 She added \"[a]ll of you, yes, I know you're va ccinated, you're the smart ones, but you know there's people out there who aren't listening to God and what God wants. You know who they are. I need you to be my apostles.\" Ibid. She told the other congregation: How can you believe that God would give a v ac- cine that would cause you harm? That is not the truth. Those are just lies out there on social me- dia. And all of you, have to be not just the true believers, but our apostles to go out there and spread the word that we can get out of this once and for al l, if everybody gets vaccinated.4 New York has also announced it will deny unem- ployment benefits to those who were fired due to their religious beliefs. New York introduced this additional penalty on September 25, 2021, two days before the original deadline for vaccination. Ever since, the New 3 N.Y.

State Governor's Office, Governor Hochul Attends Ser- vices at Abyssinian Baptist Church (Sept. 12, 2021), https://perma.cc/LF4N -DHZX . 7 York Department of Labor has made clear that healthcare workers who \"are terminated for refusing an employer -mandated vaccination will be ineligible\" for unemployment benefits.5 While healthcare work- ers with other reasons for unemployment remain eli- gible for \"case -by-case\" determination, religious objec- tors to COVID vaccination are categorically ineligible for benefits.6 Two days after th is announcement , Governor Hochul declared a \"statewide disaster emergency\" to address an increasing shortage of healthcare profes- sionals .7 She authorized calling in medical personnel who are not licensed in New York, allowing practice by recent graduates not yet licensed anywhere, bringing medical professionals from o ther countries, and, if nec- essary, deploying the National Guard.8 On Christmas Eve, the New York Department of Health announced that, in light of \"severe staffing shortages,\" it would \"allow\" fully vaccinated healthcare workers who were infected with COVI D to return to work after five days even if they were still experiencing symptoms.

Petitioners Petitioners are 16 healthcare workers who served throughout the COVID pandemic , including before vaccines were available. Doctor J . is an OB/GYN who treated many patients with COVID while she herself was pregnant. App. 190a . Doctor F. is an oral surgeon who never turned away a patient with COVID who needed care in the rural upstate region that his clinic serves. App. 185a . Doctor P. is a third -year OB/GYN resident who cared for many COVID patients during her ICU rotation. App. 200a . Seven Petitioner s have already recovered from COVID. App. 192a , 200a, 204a ; see also 119, \u00b6 138, \u00b6 222, Hochul , No. 21-1009 (N.D.N.Y. Jan. 30, 2022), Doc. 40. All 16 have uncontested sincere religious ob- jections to the COVID vaccines due to their origin from \"abortion -derived fetal cell lines in testing, develop- ment, or production.\" App. 176a . When New York eliminated religious exemptions on August 26 , 2020 , four Petitioners had already re- ceived religious exemptions from their employers , only to have them revoked . App. 181a (Nurse A); App. 185a (Dr. F .); App. 198a (Dr. O .); App. 204a -205a (Dr. S .). C. District Court Proceedings In September 2021 , the district court granted Peti- tioners ' motio n for a temporary restraining order . In 9 N.Y. State Governor's Office , Governor Hochul Announces Di- rect Payments to Healthcare Workers (Jan. 5, 2022), https://perma.cc/LTR8 -KB9B . 9 October , it issued a preliminary injunction, holding that Petitioners were likely to succeed on their free ex- ercise claim . The court found that New York's man- date is \"not a neutral law\" but a der' that triggers heightened scrutiny\" because it \"ef- fectively targets religious opposition to the available COVID -19 vaccines.\" App. 89a. The court also found that the mandate is not generally applicable because it includes a broad medical exemption that allows the medically exempt to continue working on -site, even though the unvaccinated for medical reasons pose the same \"unacceptable\" workplace risk as th ose who are unvaccina ted for religious reasons. App. 90a. Respond- ents were likely to fail strict scrutiny because they did not explain why the accommodations for medically ex- empt workers could not also extend to religious objec- tors, nor why they \"chose to depart from * * * other jurisdictions \" granting religious exemptions. App. 92a. The court also held that Petitioners were likely to prevail on their argument that Title VII preempted New York's mandate , because Title VII demands \"fa- vored treatment\" religious employees thro ugh rea- App. 83a (quoting EEOC v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc. , 575 U.S. 768, 775 (2015)). Yet the \"broad scope\" of the mandate has \"ef- fectively foreclosed the pathway to seeking a religious accommodation that is guaranteed under Title VII,\" by preventing Petitioners ' employers from granting re- ligious exemptions or engaging in the interactive pro- cess that Title VII requires. App. 84a-86a. Respondents appealed. 10 D. Second Circuit Proceedings On October 29, 2021, the Second Circuit issued an order revers ing the district court's preliminary injunc- tion. App.63. A few days later, t he Second Circuit fol- lowed its order with a per curiam opinion explaining the order . App.1a. The court acknowledged th at Peti- tioners here are \"subject to meaningful burdens on their religious practice\" yet described their harm as \"not of a constitutional dimension.\" App. 53a. Citing the Ninth Circuit's decision in Stormans , Inc. v. Wies- man and the Tenth Circuit's 303 Creat ive LLC v. Elenis , the Second Circuit emphasized that \"[t]he mere existence of an exemption procedure, absent any showing that secularly motivated conduct could be im- permissibly favored over religiously motivated con- duct,\" does not trigger strict scrutiny. App. 41a (inter- nal quotation marks omitted). Finding the mandate neutral and generally applicable, the Second Circuit concluded that it is subject to only rational basis re- view. App. 44a. Without claiming any difference in the risk of spreading COVID, the p anel found that an un- vaccinated medically exempt employee could never- theless be \"substantially distinguish[ed]\" from an un- vaccinated religious objector by relying heavily on \"limited data\" suggesting religious objections were more common, drawn from affida vits New York filed in a state -court action weeks after the injunction was entered here. App. 38a. The Second Circuit held that the mandate was neu- tral and generally applicable under Smith . With re- gard to neutrality, the court concluded that the law was neu tral because it was motivated by \"public health.\" App. 32a. The court swept aside Governor Hochul's statements expressing hostility to ward the 11 healthcare workers' religious beliefs as mere \"personal opinion\" consistent with a \"religion -neutral govern- ment interest\" in increased vaccination. App. 31a-32a. The Second Circuit held that the mandate was gen- erally applicable notwithstanding the medical exemp- tion. While it acknowledged that workers unvac- cinated for medical reasons could pose the same risk of COVID spread as those unvaccinated for religious reasons , the court found that medical exemptions served the state's interest in avoiding \"staffing short- ages\" by allowing medically workers \"to con- tinue working.\" App. 34a, 37a . The Second Circuit also held that the medical ex- emptions \u2014which require an individualized assess- ment \u2014were not 'mere exist- ence of an exemption procedure' absent any showing that secularl y motivated conduct could be impermissi- bly favored over religiously motivated conduct , is not enough to render a law not generally applicable.\" Ibid. The panel concluded that the mandate didn't vio- late Title VII because it \"does not foreclose all oppor- tunity\" for religious claimants \"to secure a reasonable accommodation\" since religious objectors could be given remote assignments \"such as telemedicine.\" App. 48a-49a. The court acknowledged that \"this case raises dif- ficult, apparently unusual questi ons as to imminent irreparable harm,\" because Petitioners may lack a remedy for the devastating financial and professional losses they face . App. 54a. The court noted even if Pe- titioners win and prove damages, \"it is not at all clear who would pay them\" bec ause \"sovereign immunity 12 would likely prevent [Petitioners] from obtaining money damages from the State\" and private employ- ers could argue they were \"compelled by law to termi- nate the employment.\" App.54a -55a. On November 5, the district court vacated the pre- liminary injunction . The district court observed that plaintiffs' verified complaint included uncontested as- sertions that , because of the mandate , \"some of plain- tiffs' employers h ad revoked existing accommodations, and that other employers had refused t o consider new requests for accommodation .\" App. 102a. The district court said that , because of the Second Circuit's holding that the mandate did not conflict with Title VII , \"these arbitrary denials can no longer happen,\" and \" plain- tiffs no longer need the preliminary injunction.\" App. 103a . The Second Circuit then issued a clarifying opinion on November 12, explaining that the only way New York's mandate allows employers to \"accommo- date\" (but not \"exempt\") employees with religio us ob- jections is to \"remove [] the individual from the scope of the Rule\" by excluding them from the category of \"personnel\" entirely. App.69a-70a. E. Proceedings in this Court On November 12, Petitioners filed an emergency application for injunctive relief in this Court. Emer- gency Application, Dr. A v. Hochul, No. 21A145 (Nov. 12, 2021 ). On December 13, 2021, the Court denied Pe- titioners' application . App. 105a . Three Justices would have granted emergency re- lief. In Justice Gorsuch's dissent , joined by Justice Alito, he pointed out that \"no one seriously disputes\" the \"irreparable injury\" that Petitioners are suffering, and that it is \"clear\" that they \"are likely to succeed on 13 the merits of their First Amendment claim .\" App. 111a . Not o nly does the record \"exude [] suspicion of those who hold unpopular religious beliefs,\" but the mandate \"intentionally\" \"targeted [them] for disfa- vor.\" App. 113a. Citing Fulton v. City of Philadelphia , Justice Gorsuch explained that New York's regulation \"prohibits exemptions for religious reasons while per- mitting exemptions for medical reasons,\" which \"un- dermines the government's asserted interest s in a similar way. \" App. 114a . Further, Justice Gorsuch em- phasized that the mandate fails strict scrutiny be- cause \"nearly every other State has found that it can satisfy its COVID -19 public health goals without co- ercing religious objectors to accept a vaccine .\" App. 115a -116a . Finally, Justice Gorsuch pointed t o District v. Gobitis as a \"cautionary tale,\" argu ing that neither wars nor pandemic s justify the infringement of First Amendment rights, and that this Court must be \"willing [] to defend more than the shadow of freedom in the trying times, not just the easy ones .\" App. 119a -120a . F. Further Proceedings Petitioners then filed a petition for rehearing en banc. The Second Circuit denied the petition on Janu- ary 11, 2022. App. 122a -123a. On January 30, 2022, Petitioners filed an amended complaint in the North- ern District of New York . See Am. Compl. , Dr. A ., No. , Doc. Since the Second Circuit's vacatur on October 29, 2021, every Petitioner except one has been fired, 14 forced to resign, lost admitting privileges, or been co- erced into vaccination.10 Vaccinated Petitioners now face a booster mandate. App.158a. Only Doctor F. re- mains at his job without violating his religion , because he received a medical exempt ion after his employer re- voked his religious exemption due to New York's man- date.11 REASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION I. The decision below conflicts with this Court's recent precedents and deepens existing split s over the application of the Free Exercise Clause. Under current doctrine, laws that burden religion are subject to strict scrutiny under the Free Exercise Clause if they are not neutral and generally applica- ble. Employment Div. v. Smith , 494 U.S. 872, 879 (1990); Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City 10 Amended Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 91-98 (Dr. A. lost admitting privi- leges ); \u00b6\u00b6 103-112 (Nurse A . submitted to against her be- liefs); \u00b6\u00b6 120-131 (Dr. C . religious exem ption); \u00b6\u00b6 159-167 . submitted 174-181 resigned 223-233 (Nurse N. was fired); \u00b6\u00b6 239-247 submitted to vaccine against his beliefs); \u00b6\u00b6 258-260 (Dr. P . submitted to vaccine against 265-272 (Dr. . lost admitting privileges); \u00b6\u00b6 280-285 (Nurse S . submitted to vaccine against her beliefs) ; \u00b6\u00b6 291-293 (Physician Liaison X . was fired). 11 One of the original plaintiffs in this case, Technologist P ., moved to a state with no vaccine mandate and is no longer part of the lawsuit. 15 of Hialeah , 508 U.S. 520, 531 (1993) . The Second Cir- cuit exacerbated two circuit splits over how to deter- mine whether a law is neutral and generally applica- ble. First, the panel's decision puts it on the w rong side of a 4 -4 split over how to evaluate categorical secular exemptions for purposes of determining general ap- plicability. Next, the Second Circuit deepened a 4-5 split over whether a plaintiff must show animus to demonstrate non -neutrality for purpos es of the Free Exercise Clause. And in each of these splits, the Sec- ond Circuit's approach directly conflicted with this Court's recent guidance in Fulton , Tandon , decision deepens a now 4-4 split over whether the existence of categorical secular exemptions destroys a law's general applicability. The Second Circuit 's decision deepens a split among the lower courts over the impact of categorical exemptions on whether a law qualifies as \"genera lly applicable.\" On o ne side of the split stand decisions of the Third , Sixth , and Eleventh Circuit s and the Iowa Supreme Court . These courts hold that general ap- plicability is defeated by the presence of secular ex- emption s that undermine the government's asserted interes t. On the other side of the split , the Second Cir- cuit's decision below joined with the First, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits to hold that the existence of secular ex- emptions does not trigger strict scrutiny. Indeed, the First and Ninth Circuit decisions involv ed COVID vac- cine mandates , and, like the Second Circuit, specifi- cally decline d to treat medical exemption s as compa- rable to religious exemptions . 16 1. The Third, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuits and the Iowa Supreme Court consider the ava ilability of cate- gorical secular exemptions sufficient to demonstrate that a law is not generally applicable and thus trigger strict scrutiny. In Monclova Christian Acad emy v. Toledo -Lucas County Health Department , 984 F.3d 477 (6th Cir. 2020), the Sixth Circuit considered a private religious school's challenge to government orders that closed all schools while allowing gyms, tanning salons, office buildings, and casinos to remain open. Id. at 482. In rejecting the argument that the only comparable facil- ities were secular schools, the Sixth Circuit explained that \"comparability is measured against the interests the State offers in support of its restrictions on con- duct\" and held that a \"myopic focus\" on schools runs contrary to precedent that the proper com parators are those that also contribute to public health risk related to COVID. Id. at 480 -481 (emphasis in original). Likewise, the Third Circuit held that even a single medical exemption to an otherwise applicable prohibi- tion can trigger strict scrutiny , regardless of whether other secular conduct is likewise banned. Fraternal Order of Police v. City of Newark , 170 F.3d 359, 365- 366 (3d Cir. 1999) . There, the Third Circuit held that the police department's policy banning beards for reli- gious reasons but allowing them for medical purposes triggered strict scrutiny because it \"actually create[d] a categorical exemption for individuals with a secular objection but not for individuals with a religious objec- tion.\" Id. at 365. And the Eleventh Ci rcuit, i n Midrash Sephardi, Inc. v. Town of Surfside , held that a law that treats 17 \"similarly situated\" groups differently \"indicates an infringement of the Smith principles of neutrality and general applicability.\" 366 F.3d 1214, 1232 -1233 (11th Cir. 2004) . The zoning ordinance in Midrash excluded churches and synagogues from the city's business dis- trict while allowing private clubs. Id. at 1220 -1221. The Eleventh Circuit concluded that the zoning ordi- nance was not generally applicable because of the sec- ular exemption for clubs . Finally, the Iowa Supreme Court has refused to enforce laws that contain exemptions. In Mitchell County v. Zimmerman , the court examined a county \"ordinance [that] forb[ade] driving\" vehicles with \"steel cleats\" on the highways. 810 N.W.2d 1, 3 (Iowa 2012) . That ordinance was problematic for certain Mennonites, who were required by their faith to drive tractors only if the ir \"wheels are equipped with steel cleats.\" Ibid. The Iowa Supreme Court held that the law was \"not generally applicable\" because it had ex- emptions ( e.g., for school buses), and thus it was sub- ject to strict scrutiny. Id. at 15 -17. 2. By contrast, t he Firs t, Second, Ninth , and Tenth Circuits require free exercise plaintiffs to show more than the existence of comparable secular exemption s to challenge general applicability. Below, t he Second Circuit declined to apply height- ened scrutiny even though New York's vaccine man- date treated unvaccinated religious objectors worse than unvaccinated workers with a medical exemption. The court ackn owledged that an individual worker who is unvacc inated for medical reasons could pose the same risk of COVID spread as one unvaccinated for religious reasons. App. 37a. Yet workers who are 18 unvaccinated for medical reasons are permitted to re- main on the job, while unvaccinated religious workers are not. See App.34a . In Iowa and the Third, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuits, that would have been enough to require strict scrutiny. In splitting with those courts , the Second Circuit pivoted to a new rationale, reason ing that medical ex- emption s do not defeat general applicability because they serve the state's interest in avoiding \"staffing shortages\" by allowing medically exempt workers \"to continue working .\" App .34a. That pivot failed on its own terms , since an interest in adequate staffing was equally threa tened by firing religious objectors. In any event, a s a result of rejecting the approaches of other circuits, the Second Circuit was able to find New York's mandate \"generally applicable\" so that the \"meaningful burdens on * * * religious practice\" were \"not of a constitutional dimension .\" App. 53a. That align ed the Second Circuit with the First and Ninth Circuit s. Weeks before the decision below, the First Circuit upheld a Maine vaccine mandate that categorically reject ed religio us exemptions while in- cluding a broad exemption for healthcare employees for whom vaccination even \"may\" be medically \"inad- visable.\" See Does 1 -6 v. Mills , 16 F.4th 20, 30 (1st Cir. 2021). Although the Maine law allowed medically ex- empt workers who were un vaccinated to contin ue working while excluding religious objectors, the First Circuit found the law generally applicable , because it credited the State's argument that the secular exemp- tion would protect health and keep facilities open. Id. at 30 -32. 19 The Ninth Circuit 's decision \u2014currently before this Court on a separate emergency application \u2014upheld the San Diego Unified School District's vaccine man- date that prohibits in-person attendance by students unvaccinated for religious reasons . Doe v. San Diego Unified Sch. Dist. , 19 F.4th 1173, 1182 (9th Cir. (9th Cir. 2022) (Mem.) . That mandate, however, contains several categorical exemptions , including for students and staff with med- ical exemptions , students in the \"conditional enroll- ments \" process of being newly admitted, all students under the age of 16, and all 16-year-old students whose birthdays were after November 1, 2021 . Id. at 1175-1176 ; id. at 1187 (Ikuta, J., dissenting) . These exemptions comprise tens of thousands of students \u2014 nearly 85% of all District students \u2014but exclude reli- gious objectors San Diego Unified , 22 F.4th 1103 (Bumatay, J., dissenting from denial of reh 'g). Even though such categorical exemptions allow ed other unvaccinated students to attend school in person while unvaccinated religious objectors were barred , the Ninth Circuit refused to apply str ict scrutiny . The panel found that if the number of students requesting religious exemptions was larger than the numb er seeking medical exemptions ( of which the District of- fered no proof), then the District's medical exemption \"would not qualify as 'comparable' to the religious ex- emption in terms of the 'risk' each exemption poses to the government's asserted interests ,\" and therefore would not undermine general applicability. San Diego Unified , 19 F.4th at 1178. The majority distinguished conditional enrollment , noting it \"is both of temporary duration and of limited scope .\" Id. at 1179 . 20 In dissent , Judge Ikuta pointed to Tandon and con- cluded that the majority erred in its general applica- bility analysis \"by focusing on the School District's reasons for offering an exemption, rather than the in- terest that the School District actually asserts to jus- tify the mandate .\" San Diego Unified , 19 F.4th at 1185 (Ikuta, J., dissenting) . The District's mandate, Judge Ikuta explained, \"treats secular and religious activity differently\" by allowing \"in -person attendance by stu- dents unvaccinated for medical reasons, and in -person attendance by unvaccinated new enrollees who meet certain criteria\" while disallowing \" any form of in -per- son attendance by students unvaccinated for religious reasons.\" Id. at 1184 (emphasis in original) . Notably, ten other Ninth Circuit judges agreed that strict scrutiny should apply and would have granted rehearing on that basis. See San Diego Uni- fied, 22 F.4th at 1100 -1101 denial of reh 'g) (\"Our court's decision once again disregards Supreme Court precedent and threatens the religious liberty of tens of thousands of students\"); id. at 1114 (Bress, J., dissenting from denial of reh 'g); id. at 1115 (Forrest, J., dissent ing from denial of reh'g); id. at 1114 (O'Scannlain, J., statement respect- ing denial of reh'g ). Finally, the Second Circuit relied on the Tenth Cir- cuit's decision in 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis , 6 F.4th 1160 (10th Cir. 2021), for cert. filed Sept. 24, 2021). App.41a (citing 303 Creative ). There, the Tenth Circuit considered a free exercise challenge to Colorado's Anti -Discrimination Act. The statute prohibited the plaintiff's religious decision not to en- gage in speech supporting same -sex marriage, but per- mitted o thers to take actions that the state deemed 21 \"message -based refusals [that] are unrelated to class - status.\" 303 Creative 6 F.4th at 1187 . The court rea- soned that the statu te was still generally applicable even if it created \" a gerrymander favoring LGBT con- sumers, as opposed Circuit's decision deepens a now 4 -5 circuit split over whether a plain- tiff must show animus to demonstrate that a law is not neutral , thus triggering strict scrutiny under the Free Exercise Clause . The Second Circuit also put itself on the wrong side of a 4-5 circuit split over whether non-neutrality under the Free Ex ercise Clause requires a showing of ani- mus. 1. In the Third, Sixth , Tenth , and Eleventh Cir- cuits, a law can be non -neutral and thus trigger strict scrutiny without any showing that it was motivated by animus or hostility . In these circuits, the \"constitutional benchmark is 'government neutrality ,' not 'governmental avoidance of bigotry.\" Roberts v. Neace , 958 F.3d 409 , 415 (6th Cir. 2020) (quoting Colorado Christian Univ. v. Weaver , 534 F.3d 1245, 1260 (10th Cir. 2008) (McC onnell, J.) ). And the relevant prohibited intent is the \"intent to treat differently\" or \"distinctive[ly .]\" Weaver , 309 F.3d 144, 165 -170 (3d Cir. 2002) ; Fraternal Ord er, 170 F.3d at 365 (Alito, J.) . 22 In Weaver , the Tenth Circuit explained that if neu- trality only protected against \"animus,\" then \"the gov- ernment could favor religions that are traditional, that are comfortable, or whose mor es are compatible with the State, so long as it does not act out of overt hostility to the others.\" Weaver , 534 F.3d at 1260 . See of Coweta , 449 F.3d 1132, 1145 (10th Cir. 2006) (McConnell, J.) (\"[T]he Free Exercise Clause is not confined to actions based on animus.\"). In Roberts , the Sixth Circuit applied this principle when striking down a COVID -related worship re- striction that had been enforced against Kentucky churchgoers on Easter Sunday . The court found that \"it ma [de] [no] difference that faith -based bigotry did not motivate the orders ,\" because , among other things, \"a law can reveal a lack of neutrality by protecting sec- ular activities more than comparable religious ones.\" Roberts , 958 F.3d at 415. In Midrash , the Eleventh Circuit applied the same principle to protect a Jewish synagogue zoned out of a local \"business district .\" 366 F.3d at 1243. The munic- ipal defendants protested that their laws were not mo- tivated by animus, but the Eleventh Circuit held that \"[u]nder Lukumi , it is unnecessary to identify an in- vidious intent in enacting a law .\" Id. at 1234 n. 16. Finally, the Third Circuit has relied on a similar view of neutrality to protect Orthodox Jews in New Jersey and Muslim firefighters in Philadelphia . It held in Tenafly that t he Free Exercise Clause's mandate of neutrality toward religion prohibits government from \"deciding that secular motivations are more important than religious motivations .\" 309 F.3d at 165 (quot ing Fraternal Ord er, 170 F.3d at 365). And in Fraternal 23 Order, it held that a police department's \"decision to provide medical exemptions while refusing religious exemptions \" was not neutral for the same reason . 170 F.3d at 365. 2. By contrast, i n the First , Seventh, Ninth , D.C., and now Second Circuit s, a law admittedly intended to prevent a specific religious exercise is still \"neutral\" absent some additional showing of hostility or animus . In Mills , the First Circuit held that Maine's deci- sion to remove its religious and philosophical exemp- tion from the healthcare worker vaccine mandate was neutral because Maine did not have an \"improper mo- tive.\" 16 F.4th 20, 34 (1st Cir. 2021). The First Circuit contrasted Maine's mandate with New York's man- date at issue in this appeal , characterizing New York's mandate as a \"religious gerrymander.\" Id. at 35. The Seventh Circuit has also long require d target- ing or animus to show non -neutrality under the Free Exer cise Clause. In Vision Church v. Village of Long Grove , the court even held that churches could be \"neutrally \" targeted, as long as the targeting was not because of religion: \"Even if Vision was targeted by the Assembly Ordinance, this does not mean that i t was targeted because of religion [.]\" 468 F.3d 975, 999 (7th Cir. 2006) (emphasis original). The court has contin- ued in this vein ever since, including in COVID wor- ship restriction cases. See St. John's United Church of Christ v. City of Chicago , 502 F.3d 616, 633 (7th Cir. 2007) ( plaintiff required to show government was \"tar- geting religious institutions or practices \"); Illinois Bi- ble Colls . Ass'n v. Anderson , 870 F.3d 631, 639 Cir. 2017), as amended (Oct. 5, 2017) ( \"they are neu-24 tral: They do not target religion or religious institu- tions. There is no allegation of an underlying religious animus. \"); Cassell v. Snyders , 990 F.3d 539, 550 (7th Cir. 2021) (\"We have not been presented with any evi- dence of hostile targeting here.\") . In Stormans, Inc. v. Wiesman , the Ninth Circuit held that state pharmacy rules that allowed pharma- cists not to dispense emergency contraceptives for a host of reasons \u2014except religious objections \u2014did not trigger strict scrutiny under the Free Exercise Clause. 794 F.3d 1064, 107 9 (9th Cir. 2015). The Court held that \"[e]ven if the Commission had drafted and adopted the rules solely in response to incidents of re- fusal to deliver Plan B, that fact would not necessarily mean that the rules were drafted with the intent of discriminat ing against religiously motivated conduct. Id. at 1079 n.6 (emphasis in original). Thus, i n the Ninth Circuit's view, the state could specifically and knowingly impose special penalties on religiously ob- jecting pharmacists, just as long as there is no \"int ent of discriminating.\" The D.C. Circuit also requires animus or hostility to prove non -neutrality . In Archdiocese of Washington v. WMATA , held that \"hostility,\" \"discrimi- natory intent,\" or \"bias\" were required to find a lack of neutrality under Lukumi : \"Nothing in the record indi- cates Guideline 12 was motivated by the 'hostility ' that motivated the city ordinance in Lukumi Babalu . The Archdiocese has made no showing * * * that the WMATA Board of Directors harbored any discrimina- tory intent or pro - or anti -religion bias in its deci- sionmaking process. \" 897 F.3d 314, 332 (D.C. Cir. 2018) . Thus the D.C. Circuit could convince itself that 25 an advertising regulation specifically targeting reli- gious speech for exclusion from public transit was \"neutral\" under Smith and Lukumi . Here, t he Second Circuit joined the side of the cir- cuit split that requires animus or hostility. The Court did not disagree with the district court's finding that New York's removal of the religious exemption was \"intentional .\" Yet it concluded that the law was neu- tral because it was motivated by \"public health.\" App.26a-27a. That approach aligned the Second Cir- cuit with the Ninth Circuit's Stormans decision, where a law burdening religion was deemed neutral because it did not explicitly express animosity toward religion and, in the Ninth Circuit's view, was justifie d by secu- lar reasons.12 794 F.3d at 1076, 1080. 3. Under the legal standards that apply in the Third, Sixth , Tenth , and Eleventh Circuit s, New York's differential treatment of vaccine objectors would have been more than enough to demonstrate the law's non -neutrality and thus trigger strict scru- tiny under the Free Exercise Clause .13 By contrast, in the First, Seventh, Ninth, D.C., and now Second Cir- 12 To reach this result, the Second Circuit disregarded its own prior holdings that laws that are \"not neutral in 'operation '\", es- pecially laws \"drafted * * * to achieve [the] result\" of excluding religious practices are not neutral, regardless of whether there is any targeted religious \"animus.\" Cent ral Rabbinical Cong. v. New York City Dep't of Health & Mental Hygiene , 763 F.3d 183, 194-95 (2d Cir. 2014) . 13 In the Sixth and Tenth Circuits, revok ing an existing reli- gious accommodation would be strong evidence of discriminatory intent. Ashaheed v. Currington , 7 492 (6th Cir. 26 cuits, courts require an affirmative showing of hostil- ity towards the religious objector for non-neut rality to be present . This split is longstanding, square , and en- trenched \u2014and only this Court can resolve it. C. The Second Circuit's decision directly conflicts with this Court's recent Free Exercise Clause decisions . In committing these errors and deepening these splits, the Second Circuit ignored the clear instruc- tions of this Court's recent Free Exercise decisions. 1. First, the Second Circuit ignored the lessons from Fulton and Tandon by declining to apply strict scrutiny to a rule with categorical exemptions. A law \"lacks general applicability if it prohibits religious conduct while permitting secular conduct that under- mines the government's asserted interests in a similar way.\" Fulton v. City of Philadelphia , 141 S. Ct. 1868, 1877 (2021). This standard is triggered when a law \"treat[s] any comparable secular activity more favora- bly than religious exercise.\" Tandon v. Ct. 1294, 1296 (per curiam) (emphasis in original ); see also Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley v. Sisolak , 140 S. Ct. 2603, 2613 (2020) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (\"The point is not whether one or a few sec- ular analogs are regulated. The quest ion is whether a single secular analog is not regulated.\" (citation omit- ted)). Further, \"[c]omparability is concerned with the risks various activities pose, not the reasons why\" those activities are undertaken. Tandon , 141 S. Ct. at 1296 . Tandon emphasize d that this Court's decisions have made these points \"clear.\" Ibid. Yet the court below treated as generally applicable a rule that allows unvaccinated healthcare workers to 27 continue working on -site if they are unvaccinated for medical reasons, but \"refus [ed] to extend\" those ac- commodations at 1878 (quoting Smith , 494 U.S. at 884). That squarely conflicts with Fulton and Tandon . And the Second Circuit's attempts to circumvent this Court's precedents made the violation only worse . For instance, the Second Circuit credited New York's interest in preventing \"staffing shortages\" for medical exemptions, but failed to apply the same analysis to religious exemptions.14 That is exactly kind of value - laden unde rinclusivity in favor of \"conduct that is not motivated by religious conviction\" which triggers strict scrutiny. Lukumi , 508 U.S at 544. The court further erred by comparing the numbers of requests for medical exemptions and religious ex- emptions that New York estimated would be re- quested. But under Fulton , it does not matter \"whether any exceptions have been given,\" 141 S. Ct. at 18 79 (emphasis added), so the question of volume was out of place in general applicability analysis. 2. The Second Circuit compounded its error by fail- ing to apply Fulton 's holding on individualized exemp- tions. In Fulton , the Court held that \"[t]he creation of a formal mechanism for granting exceptions renders a policy not generally applicable.\" 141 S. Ct. at 1879. If New York's mandate has an individualized exemption procedure, and denies religious exemptions, that de- nial should be subject to strict scrutin y. See ibid. 14 See N.Y. Exec. Order No. 4.5 (Jan. 30, 2022), https://perma.cc/CX2P -9PWK. 28 Here, New York uses an individualized exemption procedure. The Second Circuit correctly recognized that New York's individualized medical exemption was in fact an \"exemption procedure,\" but went on to hold that \"[t]he 'mere existence of an ex emption proce- dure ,' absent any showing that secularly motivated conduct could be impermissibly favored over reli- giously motivated conduct is not enough to render a law not generally applicable.\" App. 41a. To reach this result, the Second Circuit relied on cases that have been abrogated by Fulton and Tandon , including the heavily criticized Ninth Circuit decision reating the medical exem ption in the first place is the general applicability problem, since it \"'invite[s]' the government to decide which reasons for not complying with the policy are worthy of solicitude .\" 141 S. Ct. at 1879. New York thus failed to act neutrally when it \"intentionally\" re- moved an existing religious exemption and altered its unem ployment benefit program to exclude all those who lost their jobs as a result of its mandate. App. 108a -109a ; see also App.27a . This alone was suf- ficient to trigger strict scrutiny under Fulton , Trinity Lutheran , and Lukumi . But New York went further: Gove rnor Hochul pro- claimed that eliminating the religious exemption was legitimate because no \"organized religion\" objects to the COVID vaccine and asserted that religious objec- tors were not \"listening to God and what God wants .\" Supra at 5-6. Such statements failed to \"strictly ob- serve []\" the \"requisite religious neutrality\" called for by this Court's precedents. Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado C.R. Comm'n , 138 S. Ct. 1719, 173 2 29 (2018 ); cf. West Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette , 319 U.S. 624 , 642 (1943) (\"[N] o official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox \"). Yet the Second Cir- cuit found them \"neutral\" because the panel did not believe they were animus -based but instead reflected \"a deep concern for public health.\" App. 32a. Finally, t he court attempted to justify treating the medical exemption scheme as not undermining gen- eral applicability by accepting New York's speculation that the number of medical exemptions would be lower than religious exemptions. App. 35a-36a. Setting aside the error of relying on New York's self -serving specu- lation, under Fulton , it does not matter \"whether any exemptions have been given,\" 141 S. Ct. at 1879 (em- phasis ad ded). Volume was thus out of place at the general -applicability stage of the analysis. The Second Circuit's position, which was later adopted by the Ninth Circuit, Doe, 19 F.4th at 1178 , thus contradicts this Court's repeated instruction that courts must weigh the \"risk of transmission [of] applicants' pro- posed religious exercise\" in conducting comparability analysis. Tandon , 141 S. Ct. at 1297 (emphasis in orig- inal); see also Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo , 141 S. Ct. 63, 67 (2020) (finding lack of general applicability when comparable secular activities were \"treated less harshly than the Diocese's churches and Agudath Is- rael's synagogues , which have admirable safety rec- ords\" (emphasis added) ). 3. Third, the Second Circuit's decision conflicts with this Court's precedent on neutrality. A law is non-neutral whenever the government \"restricts prac- tices because of their nature.\" Fulton , 141 S. Ct. at 1877 . The Free Exercise Clause is skeptical 30 of laws that treat religion differently for the same rea- son that the Free Speech Clause is skeptical of laws that treat different kinds of speech differently based on its content. See, e.g., Reed v. Town of Gilbert , 576 U.S. 155, 16 5 (2015 ) (\"A law that is content based on its face is subject to strict scrutiny regardless of the government's benign motive, content -neutral justifica- tion, or lack of 'animus toward the ideas contained' in the regulated speech\"). Where laws permit differential treatment of speech or religion, it is extremely difficult to avoid the \"subtle departures from neutrality\" that the Constitution forbids. Cf. Masterpiece , 138 S. Ct. at 1731; Lukumi , 508 U.S. at 534. Separately, a law is also non -neut ral whenever the relevant decisionmak- ers even \"suggest []\" that \"the religious ground for [Pe- titioners'] conscience -based objection is * * * illegiti- mate.\" Masterpiece , 138 S. Ct. at 1731. Here, New York intentionally removed its religious exemption (but not its medical exemption), outlawed reasonable accommodations for religion (but not for other purposes), and declared the terminated workers ineligible for the safety net of unemployment benefits. And Governor Hochul did far more than merely \"sug- gest\" that Petitioners' religious grounds for objection were \"illegitimate.\" She explicitly denounced those be- liefs as contrary to God's will and encouraged other be- lievers to be her \"apostles\" to spread the oppos ite be- lief. By any measure, that amounts to a \"departure [] from neutrality. \" Masterpiece , 138 S. Ct. at 1731 (quot- ing Lukumi , 508 U.S. at 534). 4. The Second Circuit's departure from this Court's recent free exercise guidance is part of an un- fortunate pattern that is itself developing into a split. In the vaccine mandate context, there are now three 31 Circuits \u2014the First, Second, and Ninth \u2014that have found selective vaccine mandates to be neutral and generally applicable, despite this Court's recent deci- sions to the contrary . Only the Sixth Circuit has properly applied this Court's recent guidance in the vaccine mandate context. Dahl , 15 F.4th at 733. These decisions indicate that the failure to follow this Court's guidance is not an isolated problem , and that this Court therefore needs to at least rearticulate and clar- ify the relevant doctrines so that the lower courts can properly apply them. II. The decision below shows the Court should overrule Smith . The deep circuit splits and New York's punitive treatment of religious objectors exist because of Smith . It was Smith that made it possible for the Sec- ond Circuit to acknowledge that New York's rule cre- ated \"meaningful burdens\" on religion but still think those burdens were \"not of a constitutional dimen- sion.\" App. 53a. This is because Smith \"drastically cut back on the protection provided by the Free Exercise Clause,\" Kennedy v. Bremerton Sch. Dist. , 139 S. Ct. 634, 637 (2019) (Alito, J., concurring), and in a manner that sanctions laws \"no matter how severely [they] burden [] religious exercise,\" Fulton , 141 S. Ct. at 1882 (Barrett, J., concurring). Despite the limitations this Court has placed on Smith \u2014through its decisions in \u2014lower courts remain frac- tured on how to apply it, governments remain con- fused about how (and whether) to obey it, and religious minorities remain unprotected by it. 32 But c onfusion is not the only or even primary prob- lem with Smith . Fundamentally, Smith is inconsistent with the text, structure, history , and tradition of the Free Exercise Clause. The text and structure of the constitution reject Smith 's rule that \"the Free Ex ercise Clause \u2014lone among the First Amendment free- doms \u2014offers nothing more than protection from dis- crimination.\" , 141 S. Ct. at 1882 (Barrett, J., concurring) ; see also id. at 1897 (Alito, J., concurring) (\"Smith made no real attempt to square that e qual- treatment interpretation with the ordinary meaning of the Free Exercise Clause 's language, and it is hard to see how that could be done.\"). Constitutional history provides no reason to override \"the most straightfor- ward, plain -meaning interpretation o f the text\": that it protects an affirmative freedom from government interference. Douglas Laycock, Religious Liberty as Liberty , 7 J. Contemp. Legal Issues 313, 337 (1996). To the contrary, the best historical evidence \u2014such as contemporaneous state constitutions \u2014is inconsistent with Smith 's nondiscrimination -only rule. See Mi- chael W. McConnell, The Origins and Historical Un- derstanding of Free Exercise of Religion , 103 Harv. L. Rev. 1409, 1428 (1990) ; District of Columbia v. Heller , 554 U.S. 570, 600-603 (2008) (relying on state consti- tutions to interpret the Second Amendment and refus- ing to treat the federal right \"as an odd outlier\"). Nor did Smith claim otherwise. Rather, expressly ignoring history and structure, it admitted its rule was merely a \"permissible\" construction of the text, and one re- quired by policy -driven concerns that anything more would be \"courting anarchy.\" 494 U.S. a t 878, 888. 33 Even on its own terms, Smith has exacerbated so- cial unrest. Only under Smith 's impoverished free ex- ercise protections could Governor Hochul freely use government power to attack unpopular minority reli- gious views and speak at houses of worship to commis- sion attendees as \"apostles\" to bring conscientious ob- jectors into line with government orthodoxy . And Smith 's internal logic is eroding even the free exercise rights it purported to carve out. Hence New York's willingness to ignore cases like Sherbert v. Verner and use denial of unemployment coverage as leverage to coerce religious objectors facing the loss of their liveli- hoods into violating their consciences. 374 U.S. 398 (1963 ). Like her predecessor in office, Governor Hochul apparently thinks she can target a religious minority and, under Smith , face no First Amendment consequences . See Agudath Israel of Am. v. Cuomo , 141 S. Ct. 889 (2020) . Smith thus undermines the very purpose of t he Re- ligion Clauses: \"foster[ing] a society in which people of all beliefs can live together harmoniously.\" American Legion v. American Humanist Assoc. , 139 S. Ct. 2067, 2074 (2019) ; Michael W. McConnell, Free Exercise Re- visionism and the Smith Decision , 57 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1109, 1111 (1990) ( Smith is \"contrary to the deep logic of the First Amendment \"). This Court should overrule Smith and restore a standard that better protects fundamental constitu- tional rights by hewing to the text, structure, history, and tradition of the First Amendment . 34 III. The petition presents an urgent question of nationwide importance that must be settled by this Court. COVID vaccine mandates affect millions of Ameri- cans, in virtually e very context : healthcare, employ- ment, education, and ordinary civil life. These man- dates have generated scores of lawsuits across the country , resulting in dozens of emergency applications to this Court. The individual liberty questions generated by these mandates from state and local government are as important as the federal power questions that prompted the Court to grant expedited review in NFIB v. Departmen t of Labor and Biden v. Missouri . Indi- viduals subject to these mandates, their families, and governments all need to know the scope of individual liberty in this fraught context. The need for this Court's guidance is particularly pressing when it comes to vaccine mandates for healthcare workers. Medicine is a field with both tre- mendous front -end training costs and increasingly acute societal need. Overbroad mandates that fail to respect religious differences exacerbate both chal- lenges. For instance, such mandates are driving highly trained providers out of the profession and slamming the door on m edical students and residents entering the field . And because the healthcare field is subject to statewide licensure and regulation, medical professionals like Petitioners are losing not just jobs but careers. Patients \u2014the ostensible intended benefi- ciaries of the mandates \u2014will be the poorer for it , less able to access obstetric, pediatric , and other services offered by professionals like Petitioners . 35 It doesn't have to be that way. The federal healthcare worker mandate recently upheld by this Court in Biden v. Missouri includes a religious exemp- tion in a ccordance with Title VII's requirement to rea- sonably accommodate religious exercise. 86 Fed. Reg. 61,555 (2021); see also Tr. at 110: 6-8, NFIB v. Depart- ment of Labor , No. 21A244 (Jan. 7, 2022) (Solicitor General acknowledging that \"[s]ome people have deeply held religious beliefs and are entitled to reli- gious exemptions \"). Most states likewise respect med- ical conscience. See generally Addendum (47 states al- low religious exemptions) . But a handf ul of states such as New York are refusing to accommodate religious ex- ercise, forcing healthcare workers to either violate their religion or lose their jobs . Remarkably, this coer- cion has come not only while other unvaccinated work- ers are permitted to keep their careers, but even wh ile the same states ask vaccinated workers to remain on the job when they have active COVID infections. That state of affairs cannot help but be \"of a constitutional dimension\" and it surely cannot be permissible upon a mere show ing of rationality. Millions of healthcare workers and their families nationwide are watching to see whether New York will be allowed to drive out re- ligious healthcare workers with impunity. So are gov- ernment officials contemplating similar measures. Nor is the problem limited to healthcare workers. Many sectors of American life are currently wrestling with the question of COVID vaccine mandates and whether governments may punitively impose them on religious objectors while allowing secular exemptions. See, e.g., San Diego Unified , 22 F.4th at 1103 (Buma- tay, J., dissenting from denial of reh'g) (\"Our duty is always to safeguard the people's rights no matter the 36 challenges facing our communities. And the right to the free exercise of religion is foremost among our free- doms * * * even in times of crisis.\") ; Verified Com- plaint, Doe 1 v. Adams, No. 1:22-cv-676 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 7, 2022) . Moreover, where government officials are al- lowed to gerrymander COVID restrictions in ways that disfavor fundamental civil rights but favor the well-connected, trust in public institutions erodes \u2014 both in the institutions that create the mandates and those that permit them . Whether governments can im- pose COVID mandates that selectively punish reli- gious object ors is thus a pressing question of nation- wide importance in many respects . IV. This petition provides an exceptional vehi- cle for resolving th e conflict among the lower courts . New York has made this simple. Its rule for reli- gious objectors is clear both as to consequences \u2014total exclusion from the work site\u2014and compar ators \u2014a full exemption for unvaccinated employees with medical conditions, who concededly carr y the same transmis- sion risk yet are allowed to keep working the very same jobs from which religious objectors must be ex- pelled , even when infected with COVID . Its asserted interest in protecting patients from COVID has been fatally undermined both by its continued allowance of unvaccinated medically exempt workers on-site, and by its subsequent policy sending healthcare workers back to work while they have active COVID infections. The decision below is equally clear , and equally wrong . The Second Circuit purported to apply key free exercise cases like Smith and Fulton , but wrongly con- cluded that the harms to Petitioners were \"not of a 37 constitutional dimension .\" App. 53a. Instead , the Sec- ond Circuit aligned itself with controversial free exer- cise cases from the Ninth and Tenth Circuits. Its opin- ion reflects a crabbed view of free exercise rights t hat, if not corrected, will continue to harm religious believ- ers for years to come. The facts of this case are also clear. It was brought against New Y ork and its officials , so there are no pri- vate defendants to whom a different standard might apply. And New York's factual assertions about the ex- igencies of the pandemic can be easily tested against those of the 4 7 other states that are grappling with the same pandemic without subjecting religious healthcare wo rkers to selective and state -imposed ex- ile. See Addendum . Added together, these facto rs make this petition an exceptional vehicle for addressing a nationwide con- flict that urgently needs resolution by this Court . CONCLUSION The Court should grant the petition. 38 Respectfully submitted. MARK RIENZI DANIEL BLOMBERG DIANA VERM THOMSON AD\u00c8LE KEIM KAYLA A. TONEY JAMES J.

Before: WALKER, SACK, and CARNEY, Circuit Judges. ______________ In these two cases on appeal, district courts in New York State considered applications for preliminary injunctive relief that would restrain the State from enforcing its emergency rule requiring healthcare facilities to ensure that certain employees are vaccinated against COVID -19. See 10 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 2.61 (Aug. 26, 2021) (\"Section 2.61\"). The State issued Section 2.61 in response to rapidly increasing infection rates related to the Delta variant of the virus. Section 2.61 contains an exemption for employees who are unable to be safely vaccinated due to pre- existing medical conditions, but does not contain an exemption for those who object to this vaccination on religious 2agrounds. Plaintiffs, individual healthcare workers who object to receiving the vaccine because of their religious beliefs, as well as a membership organization, filed complaints and motions for preliminary injunctive relief, asserting that Section 2.61 violates their rights under the First Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Suprem acy Clause. In We The Patriots, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, the district court (Kuntz, J. ) denied the motion without opinion. In Dr. A. , filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York, the district court (Hurd, J. ) granted the motion, deciding that Plaintiffs had established that Section 2.61 was likely neither neutral towards religion nor generally applicable, triggering strict scrutiny under the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause, and that the State had failed to establish that Section 2.61 was likely narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest under strict scrutiny review. The district court in Dr. A. also concluded that Section 2.61 was likely preempted by Title VII's protection for employees who require religious accommodations, and thus ran afoul of the Supremacy Clause. On appeal, focusing on the requirements for the grant of a preliminary injunction, we conclude that Plaintiffs in both cases have failed to establish a likelihood of success on any of their claims, and thus the Dr. A. district court's issuance of a preliminary injunction was in error. As to Plaintiffs' Free Exercise claims, we conclude that Plaintiffs have not shown that they are likely to succeed in establishing (1) that Section 2.61 is not a neutral law of general applicability, or (2) that \u2014in the resulting inquiry \u2014 Section 2.61 does not satisfy rational basis review. 3aNext, we determine that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on their Supremacy Clause claim: it appears to us fully possible for employers to comply with both Section 2.61 and Title VII. Finally, we decide that Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on their claims that Section 2.61 contravenes the Fourteenth Amendment. The order of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York is therefore AFFIRMED, the order of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York is REVERSED, and the preliminary injunction entered by that court is VACATED. These tandem cases are REMANDED to their respective district courts for further proceedings consistent with the Order entered by this Court on October 29, 2021, and this Opinion. ______________ CAMERON L.

See 10 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 2.61 (Aug. 26, 2021) covered entities\") (\"Section 2.61\" or \"the Rule\"). The State issued the Rule in response to rapidly increasin g infection rates related to the Delta variant of the SARS -CoV- 2 virus, a virus that has caused widespread suffering in the State, country, and world since early 2020. The State described the Rule's purpose as primarily to preserve the health of healthcare workers, and from that narrow purpose, more broadly, to keep patients and the public safe from COVID -19. The Rule establishes a medical exemption to the vaccination requirement, but \u2014consistent with New York's prior vaccination requirements for healthcare workers \u2014does not include an exemption based on religious belief. The Rule permits, but does not require, employers to make other accommodations for individuals who choose not to be vaccinated based on their sincere religious beliefs. 6aThe moving parties \u2014primarily healthcare workers allegedly affected by the Rule\u2014challenge the Rule's omission of a religious exemption by asserting claims under the First Amendment, the Supremacy Clause, and the Fourteenth Amendment. Both groups of Plaintiffs moved to enjoin enforcement of the Rule. One district court granted the preliminary relief requested, enjoining the Rule insofar as it prevented healthcare workers from being eligible for an exemption based on religious belief; the other denied it. See Dr. A. v. Hochul , No. 21 -cv-1009, 2021 WL 4734404 (N.D.N.Y. 2021) (granting preliminary injunction) (\" Dr. A. \"); We The Patriots USA, Inc. v. Hochul , No. 21cv -4954 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 12, 2021) (denying preliminary injunction) (\" We The Patriots\" or \" WTP \"). The individual plaintiffs in Dr. A. are nurses, doctors, and other personnel employed by healthcare facilities in New York State; in We The Patriots, they are three nurses similarly employed and a related nonprofit organization. All individual plaintiffs aver that to receive any one of the three currently available vaccines against COVID -19 (Pfizer -BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson) would violate their religious beliefs because those vaccines were developed or produced using cell lines derived from cells obtained from voluntarily aborted fetuses. They assert that their employers have threatened them with adverse employment consequences if they refuse to be vaccinated. Plaintiffs argue, and the district court in Dr. A. held, that they are likely to succeed in establishing that Section 2.61 violates their rights under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment and under 7athe Supremacy Clause. As to the Free Exercise Clause, Plaintiffs submit that because the State has afforded a medical exemption to its requirement, the Free Exercise Clause requires the State also to afford a religious exemption. With respect to the Supremacy Clause, the Dr. A. Plaintiffs argue that the non- discrimination obligations placed on employers by Title VII of the Civil Rights A ct of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e et seq. (\"Title VII\") preempt the State's vaccination Rule. As a third basis for relief, the WTP Plaintiffs allege that the Rule infringes their rights to privacy and bodily integrity under the Fourteenth Amendment. Under the familiar standards for a preliminary injunction that Plaintiffs must meet to obtain such relief, Plaintiffs allege that, in addition to showing a likelihood of success on the merits, they will suffer irreparable harm absent immediate relief and that the b alance of the equities and the public interest lie in their favor. The State resists, contending primarily that Section 2.61 is a neutral provision of general applicability to those covered by the Rule; that the Rule serves its goal and compelling need to preserve the health of healthcare workers; that the medical and religious exemptions would not be comparable for purposes of the Free Exercise Clause analysis required by Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith , 494 U.S. 872 (1990), and its progeny; and that Plaintiffs have not shown a likelihood of success on the merits on any of their claims or otherwise satisfied the prerequisites for entry of the exceptional relief of a preliminary injunction at this phase of the litigatio n. 8aFollowing oral argument, on October 29, 2021, this Court entered an Order disposing of the appeals and advising that an Opinion would follow. This Opinion explains the basis for that Order. As to Plaintiffs' Free Exercise claim, we conclude that Plain tiffs have not met their burden to show that they are likely to succeed in establishing (1) that Section 2.61 is not a neutral law of general applicability under Smith , or (2) that \u2014in the resulting inquiry \u2014Section 2.61 does not satisfy rational basis revie w. Next, we determine that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on their Supremacy Clause claim on the record before us, as Plaintiffs have not shown that it would likely be impossible for employers to comply with both Section 2.61 and Title VII. Finally, we decide that Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on their claim that the Rule contravenes the Fourteenth Amendment. In light of these conclusions and of our further assessment of the irreparability of the harm Plaintiffs allege, th e balance of the hardships, and the public interest in enforcing or not enforcing the Rule, we AFFIRM the order of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York denying the motion for a preliminary injunction in We The Patriots; and we REVERSE the order of the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York granting Plaintiffs' motion for the same relief in Dr. A. and VACATE the related preliminary injunction entered by that court. Finally, we REMAND both cases to their respective district courts for further proceedings consistent with our October 29, 2021 Order, and this Opinion. We stress that we do not now decide the ultimate merits of Plaintiffs' legal claims or 9aof the State's defenses; rather, we make a limited determination with respect to preliminary relief based on the limited factual record presently before this Court. BACKGROUND I. New York's Emergency Rule On August 26, 2021, New York's Department of Health adopted an emergency rule directing hospitals, nursing homes, hospices, adult care facilities, and other identified healthcare entities to \"continuously require\" certain of their employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID -19 beginning on September 27, 2021, for \"general hospitals\" and nursing homes, and on October 7, 2021, for all other \"covered entities\" as defined in the Rule. 10 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 2.61. 1 The vaccine requirement applies not to all employees, but only to those covered by the Rule's definition of \"personnel\": those employees, staff members, and volunteers \"who engage in activities such that if they were infected with COVID -19, they could potentially expose other covered personnel, patients or residents to the disease.\" Id. \u00a7 2.61(a)(2). The Rule was issued by the State's Publ ic Health and Health Planning Council, a group of 25 healthcare professionals, including the Commissioner of Health, that state law charges with issuing regulations \"affecting the security of life or health or the preservation and improvement of public hea lth,\" including those addressing the control of 1 The complete text of Section 2.61 is provided in an Appendix to this Opinion. 10acommunicable diseases. N.Y. Pub. Health L. \u00a7 225(4), (5). As required by New York law, the notice of emergency rulemaking included the Council's findings and a Regulatory Impact Statement (the \"Statement\"). See NYS Admin. Proc. Act \u00a7 202(6). The Statement explained that the Rule responded to the \"significant public health threat\" caused by the increasing circulation of the Delta variant: \"Since early July, cases have risen 10- fold, and 95 percent of the sequenced recent positives in New York State were the Delta variant.\" Dr. A. Sp. App'x at 39. It also referenced data purporting to show \"that unvaccinated individuals are approximately 5 times as likely to be diagnosed with COVID -19 compared to vaccinated individuals\" and that \"[t]hose who are unvaccinated have over 11 times the risk of being hospitalized with COVID -19.\" Id. It described vaccination as critical to controlling the spread of the disease at healthcare facilities and in congregate care settings, w hich \"pose increased challenges and urgency for controlling the spread of this disease because of [their] vulnerable patient and resident populations,\" determining that \"[u]nvaccinated personnel in such settings have an unacceptably high risk of both acqui ring COVID -19 and transmitting the virus to colleagues and /or vulnerable patients or residents, exacerbating staffing shortages, and causing unacceptably high risk of complications.\" Id. As an emergency rule, Section 2.61 is in effect for a maximum of 90 d ays, expiring on November 23, 2021, unless renewed. See id. at 38; NYS Admin. Proc. Act \u00a7 202(6)(b). 11aSection 2.61 exempts from the vaccination requirement \"personnel\" for whom \"immunization with COVID -19 vaccine is detrimental to [their] health . . . , ba sed upon a pre -existing health condition\" as more specifically defined and limited by the Rule. 10 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 2.61(d)(1). 2 The medical exemption applies \"only until such immunization is found no longer to be detrimental to [their] health.\" Id. It must be supported with a certification by a licensed physician or certified nurse practitioner issued in 2 The full text of this medical exemption under Section 2.61(d)(1) reads as follows: (1) Medical exemption. If any licensed physician or certified nurse practitioner certifie s that immunization with COVID - 19 vaccine is detrimental to the health of member of a covered entity's personnel, based upon a pre -existing health condition, the requirements of this section relating to COVID -19 immunization shall be inapplicable only until such immunization is found no longer to be detrimental to such personnel member's health. The nature and duration of the medical exemption must be stated in the personnel employment medical record, or other appropriate record, and must be in accordance with generally accepted medical standards, (see, for example, the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services), and any reasonable accommodation may be granted and must likewise be documented in such record. Covered entities shall document medical exemptions in personnel records or other appropriate records in accordance with applicable privacy laws by: (i) September 27, 2021 for general hospitals and nursing homes; and (ii) October 7, 2021 for all other covered entities. For all covered entities, documentation must occur continuously, as needed, following the initial dates for compliance specified herein, including documentation of any reasonable accommodation therefor. 10 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 2.61(d)(1). 12aaccordance with generally accepted medical standards, including recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (\"ACIP\") of the U.S. Depa rtment of Health and Human Services. Id. ; see also N.Y. State Department of Health, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Regarding the August 26, 2021 - Prevention of COVID -19 Transmission by Covered Entities Regulation , https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/ system/files/documents/2021/09/faqs- - 2021) (\" FAQs\"). Section 2.61 contains no \"exemption\" for personnel who oppose vaccination on religious or any other grounds not covered by the medical exemption; however, as we discuss below, the Rule does not prohibit employers from providing religious objectors with accommodations. On August 18, 2021, eight days before the Council promulgated Section 2.61, New York State Commissioner of Health Dr. Howard A. Zucker, acting alone, had issued an \"Order for Summary Action\" (\"the August 18 Order\" or \"the Order\") under the authority vested in him by New York Public Health Law \u00a7 16. See Dr. A. Sp. App'x at 41 -47. Section 16 permits the Commissioner to issue a short -term order\u2014effective for a maximum of 15 days\u2014if he identifies a condition that in his view constitutes a \"danger to the health of the people.\" N.Y. Pub. Health Law \u00a7 16. After making findings about the dangers of COVID -19, the Order similar ly required certain healthcare facilities to ensure that certain personnel were fully vaccinated against COVID -19 by September 27, 2021, but differed from Section 2.61, which superseded it, in several respects. Most relevant here, the Order included a reli gious 13aexemption for personnel who \"hold a genuine and sincere religious belief contrary to the practice of immunization.\" Dr. A. Sp. App'x at 45 -46. In addition, the Order could be effective for only a very brief period of time \u2014for up to 15 days \u2014whereas the Rule could be in effect for up to 90 days, subject to extensions. Further, the Order applied only to \"general hospital[s]\" and nursing homes; Section 2.61 applies more broadly, to all hospitals, nursing homes, diagnostic and treatment centers, home healt hcare agencies and similar programs, hospices, and adult care facilities. Id. at 43; 10 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 2.61(a)(1). In affidavits appended to its briefing to this Court and filed in other pending proceedings, 3 the State has provided preliminary vaccination data from the months of August through October 2021. It reflects a 3 We may take judicial notice of the existence of affidavits filed in another court. See Glob. Network Commc'ns, Inc. v. City of New York , 458 F.3d 150, 157 (2d Cir. 2006). In addition, our Court has ruled that courts may consider hearsay evidence such as affidavits when determining whether to grant a preliminary injunction. See Mullins v. City of New York , 626 F.3d 47, 52 (2d Cir. 2010); s ee also Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981) (observing that preliminary injunctive determinations may be based on \"procedures that are less formal and evidence that is less complete than in a trial on the merits\"). Thus, we consider the State's data submitted in affidavits filed in other courts. Although this data was not before the district court in WTP \u2014and therefore Plaintiffs have not had an opportunity to contest its accuracy before the district court \u2014they have not raised such a concern in their reply brief in WTP or at oral argument, nor have they challenged this Court's ability to consider the State's submissions. More broadly, Plaintiffs do not appear to contest the State's assertion derived from this data that religious exemptions ar e more common than medical exemptions, but instead consider this fact irrelevant. 14asignificant increase in vaccination rates among covered healthcare personnel that occurred after the Rule's effective date on September 27 (even though the Rule was subject to the temporary restraining order and later injunction issued in Dr. A. ). As of August 24, the State's declarant reported, 71% of workers at nursing homes and 77% of workers at adult care facilities had received at least one dose of the vaccine; 77% of workers at hospitals were fully vaccinated. See WTP Appellees' Add. at 14 -15 (Decl. of Elizabeth Rausch -Phung). As of October 19, 97.4% of workers at nursing homes and 96.7% of workers at adult care facilities had received at least one dose of the vaccine, and 91.4% of workers at hospitals were fully vaccinated. See Serafin v. New York State Dep't of Health , Index No. 908296- 21, Doc. Nos. 56. (Decl. of Valerie A. Deetz), 57 (Decl. of Dorothy Persico) (Sup. Ct. Albany County Oct . 20, 2021). Also as of October 19, between 0.4% and 0.5% of workers at each facility type were medically ineligible to receive the COVID - 19 vaccine, whereas 1.9% of workers at nursing homes and adult care facilities and 1.3% of workers at hospitals claime d \"other\" exemptions, which the State describes as reflecting religious exemptions permitted by the injunction entered in Dr. A .

They also charged that it violates their rights to privacy and \"medical freedom,\" which they locate in the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments. They asked the district court to declare Section 2.61 unconstitutional and permanently enjoin the State from enforcing it. Ten days later, the WTP Plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction immediately enjoining the State from enforcing the Rule. They argued that immediate relief was essential because Section 2.61 puts them at imminent risk of losing their jobs if they persist in refusing vaccination. In support of their motion, they provided letters from Nurse Bono's and Nurse Melendez's employer, Northwell Health, a private entity. 8 In the letter received by Nurse Bono, dated August 31, Northwell Health advised that her \"continued employment will be at risk\" if she did not receive the vacci ne by the deadline.

In its letter to Nurse Melendez, dated August 30, Northwell Health wrote only that Nurse Melendez would be required to undergo weekly PCR testing and would be unable to participate in certain meetings, gatherings, and events based on her vaccination status. 9 8 They did not name Northwell Health as a defendant or seek relief against it. 9 In their brief on appeal, the WTP Plaintiffs state that Northwell Health terminated Nurse Bono's employment on 18aThe district court denied Plaintiffs' motion on September 12, the day it was filed, without explanation and without ordering or receiving a response from the State. Plaintiffs timely appealed. B. Dr. A. v. Hochul In Dr. A. , 17 medical professionals who work in New York sued Governor Hochul, Commissioner Zucker, and Attorney General James on September 13 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York, seeking declaratory and injunctive reli ef preventing the enforcement of the Rule. 10 In their verified complaint, they alleged three bases of unconstitutionality. First, they contended that the Rule infringes on religious rights secured by the Free Exercise Clause by requiring that they be vacci nated, contrary to their religious beliefs. Second, they claimed that Section 2.61 violates the Supremacy Clause because it is preempted by Title VII, which prohibits discrimination in employment based on religion. Third, they claimed that Section 2.61 run s afoul of the Equal Protection Clause because it prevents them from seeking a religious accommodation while at the same time allowing similarly situated healthcare workers to seek a medical accommodation. September 29. The WTP Plaintiffs also assert that Nurse Synakowski was informed by her employer that her employment would be terminated by September 21 if she was not vaccinated by then, but in their briefs filed since that date they have not stated whether that came to pass. 10 The district court granted a request by the Dr. A. Plaintiffs to proceed pseudonymously. The Dr. A. Plaintiffs do not identify their employer s in their complaint. 19aThe Dr. A. Plaintiffs simultaneously moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. They sought immediate injunctive relief, citing \"imminent irreparable harm from loss of employment and professional standing\" as a result of their \"religiously motivated refusal to be vaccinated.\" Dr. A. App'x at 207. On September 14, the district court granted Plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order, enjoining the State from enforcing any requirement that employers deny religious exemptions from the vaccine requirement or that employer s revoke any religious exemption already granted, and directed the State to file its opposition to Plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction. Six days later, the district court extended the temporary restraining order for 14 days, pending its writte n opinion on Plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction to be issued on or before October 12. On October 12, the district court issued the requested preliminary injunction, resting in part on its determination that Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their Free Exercise claim. The district court concluded that Plaintiffs had established that Section 2.61 is neither a neutral law nor one of general applicability. It also ruled that Section 2.61 is likely to fail strict scrutiny. See Dr. A. , 2021 WL 4734404, at *8-9. The district court further concluded that Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their Title VII preemption claim, reasoning that Section 2.61 \"effectively foreclose[s] the pathway to seek[] a 20areligious accommodation that is guaranteed unde r Title VII.\" Id. at *6.11 The State timely appealed.12 DISCUSSION Issuance of a preliminary injunction is an \"extraordinary and drastic remedy\" that is \"never awarded as Munaf , 553 U.S. 674, 689-90 (2008) (quoting 11A C.

SCM Corp. , 774 F.2d 47, 60 (2d Cir. 1985) (quoting Medical Soc. of State of N.Y. v. Toia , 560 F.2d 535, 537 (2d Cir. 1977)). When deciding whether to issue a prel iminary injunction, courts \"should pay particular regard for the public consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of injunction.\" Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008). To obtain a preliminary injunction that \"will affect government action taken in the public interest pursuant to a statute or regulatory scheme, the moving party must demonstrate (1) irreparable harm absent injunctive relief, (2) a likelihood of success on the merits, and (3) public interest weighing in favor of granting the injunction.\" 13 Agudath Israel of Am. v. Cuomo , 983 F.3d 620, 631 (2d Cir. 2020) (internal 13 In Dr. A. , the district court applied the likelihood- of-success standard, and the Dr. A. Plaintiffs do not now argue that this was error. The parties in WTP , in contrast, cite our Court's alternative, less demanding \"serious questions\" standard for obtaining preliminary injunctive relief, which authorizes injunctive relief if the movant has shown imminent irreparable harm as well as \"sufficiently serious questions going to the merits of its claims to make them fair ground for litigation, plus a balance of the hardsh ips tipping decidedly in favor of the moving party.\" New York ex rel. Schneiderman v. Actavis PLC , 787 F.3d 638, 650 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted). But we have consistently applied the likelihood -of-success standard to cases challenging government actions taken in the public interest pursuant to a statutory or regulatory scheme, including in cases involving emergency regulations and orders. See , e.g., Agudath Israel, 983 F.3d at 631; 96, 99- 101 (2d Cir. 2008). The WTP parties have not explained why the \"serious questions\" standard should nonetheless govern here. Accordingly, in our review of both appeals, we apply the likelihood -of-success standard. 22aquotation marks omitted). The movant must also show that the balance of equities supports the issuance of an injunction. See Yang v. Kosinski , 960 F.3d 119, 127 (2d Cir. 2020). We review the grant or denial of a motion for a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion. See Freedom Holdings, Inc. v. Spitzer, 408 F.3d 112, 114 (2d Cir. 2005). A district court has exceeded the permissible bounds of its discretion when its \"decision rests on an error of law (such as application of the wrong legal principle) or a clearly erroneous factual finding\" or \"cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.\" Mastrovincenzo v. City of New York , 435 F.3d 78, 88 (2d Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because the issues and arguments presented by these two appeals overlap substantially, we consider them together, issue by issue, differentiating between them only as we think necessary. 14 I. Likelihood of Success on the Merits: Free Exercise of Religion Claim Plaintiffs contend that Section 2.61 violates their rights under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment because it does not include an exemption for employees who oppose receiving the vaccine on religious grounds. On a motion for preliminary injunction, the movants must show that they are likely to prevail on their claim that the challenged government action is 14 Although the district court's order denying the WTP Plaintiffs' motion did not state the basis for its decision, we may \"affirm on any ground supported by the record.\" NXIVM Ross (2d Cir. 2004). 23aunlawful. On the record before us, we conclude that neither t he Dr. A. Plaintiffs nor the WTP Plaintiffs have established a likelihood of success on their Free Exercise claims such that they are entitled to the \"extraordinary relief\" of a preliminary injunction. The district court's conclusion to the contrary in Dr. A. was legal error and rested on clearly erroneous findings of fact. A. The Smith Standard The First Amendment forbids the enactment of laws, either state or federal, that \"prohibit[] the free exercise\" of religion. 15 U.S. Const., amend. I. But not all laws that burden an individual's exercise of religion contravene this deeply rooted prohibition. Nor do they always trigger heightened scrutiny. The Supreme Court has long applied the standard set out by Justice Scalia f or the Court in Employment Division v. Smith to determine whether a democratically enacted law that burdens religious practice is properly considered under rational basis review or strict scrutiny. See 494 U.S. at 879; Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, 141 S . Ct. 1868, 1876 (2021). Under Smith , a \"neutral law of general applicability\" is subject to rational basis review even if it incidentally burdens a particular religious practice. 494 U.S. at 878- 79; see also Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah , 508 U.S. 520, 531 (1993). We have observed that \"[t]he teaching of Smith 15 In relevant part, the First Amendment provides that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" The stricture has been held to limit the authorities of the states as well. See Cantwell v. Connecticut , 310 U.S. 296, 303 (1940). 24ais that a state can determine that a certain harm should be prohibited generally, and a citizen is not, under the auspices of her religion, constitutionally entitled to an exemption.\" Central Rabbinical Congress of the U.S. & Canada v. N.Y.C. Dep't of Health & Mental Hygiene, 763 F.3d 183, 196 (2d Cir. 2014). But if a law is not neutral towards religion or is not generally applicable, it falls outside the boundaries of Smit h. Then, for such a law to survive, it \"must be justified by a compelling governmental interest and must be narrowly tailored to advance that interest.\" Lukumi , 508 U.S. at 531- 32. Because they seek a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs bear the initial bu rden of establishing a likelihood of success on the merits. In the context of their First Amendment claim, this means that Plaintiffs must show that they are likely to succeed on their claim that Section 2.61 is not a neutral or generally applicable rule. If they succeed at that step, the burden shifts to the State to show that it is likely to succeed in defending the challenged Rule under strict scrutiny. Cf. Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal , 546 U.S. 418, 429 (2006) (\"[T]he burde ns at the preliminary injunction stage track the burdens at trial.\"). We conclude that, at this stage, Plaintiffs have not carried their initial burden of showing that Section 2.61 is likely not neutral or generally applicable. B. Neutrality The State \"fails to act neutrally when it proceeds in a manner intolerant of religious beliefs or restricts practices because of their religious nature.\" Fulton , 141 S. Ct. at 1877; see also Lukumi , 508 U.S. at 532 (First Amendment protections apply when \" the law at 25aissue discriminates against some or all religious beliefs or regulates or prohibits conduct because it is undertaken for religious reasons\"). A law may be not neutral if it explicitly singles out a religious practice, but even a facially neutral law will run afoul of the neutrality principle if it \"targets religious conduct for distinctive treatment.\" Lukumi , 508 U.S. at 533- 34. The Supreme Court has explained that \"[a] law lacks facial neutrality if it refers to a religious practice without a s ecular meaning discernable from the language or context.\" Id. at 533. Section 2.61 is facially neutral because it does not single out employees who decline vaccination on religious grounds. It applies to all \"personnel,\" as carefully defined in the Rule, a side from those who qualify for the narrowly framed medical exemption. Plaintiffs nonetheless maintain that the regulation \"targets\" them because of their religious opposition to receiving any one of the three currently available COVID19 vaccines. In sup port, they point to events preceding the enactment of Section 2.61 and to several of Governor Hochul's public comments during the month of September as reflective of discriminatory intent on the part of the State. We take these claims in order. First, Pla intiffs argue that the fact that the August 18 Order contained a religious exemption, but Section 2.61 does not, demonstrates that in Section 2.61 the State intended to \"target\" those who object to vaccination on religious grounds, and that this reflects anti-religion animus. The district court in Dr. A. agreed, finding that the difference between the two government actions amounted to a \"religious gerrymander.\" at 535). Specifically, the district cou rt determined that Section 2.61, enacted eight days after the August 18 Order, intentionally \"amended the [August 18 Order] to eliminate the religious exemption.\" Id. As a result, the district court concluded that Plaintiffs had established a likelihood that Section 2.61 was non -neutral based on their argument that it \"effectively targets religious opposition to the available COVID -19 vaccines.\" Id. In Lukumi , the Supreme Court determined that the municipal ordinance at issue, which prohibited animal sac rifice, was not neutral because it effectively prohibited conduct only undertaken by adherents to the Santeria religion as a part of their religious practice. See 508 U.S. at 534- 35. In contrast, Section 2.61 requires all covered employees who can safely receive the vaccine to be vaccinated. It applies whether an employee is eager to be vaccinated or strongly opposed, and it applies whether an employee's opposition or reluctance is due to philosophical or political objections to vaccine requirements, concer ns about the vaccine's efficacy or potential side effects, or religious beliefs. The absence of a religious exception to a law does not, on its own, establish non -neutrality such that a religious exception is constitutionally required. Further, that the August 18 Order contained a religious exemption, while Section 2.61 does not, falls short of rendering Section 2.61 non -neutral. The historical background of Section 2.61, to be determined following discovery, may be relevant to fully discerning the State's intent, but the evidence before the district courts failed to raise an inference that the regulation was intended to be a \"covert suppression of particular 27areligious beliefs.\" New Hope Family Servs., Inc. v. Poole , 145, 163 (2d Cir. 2020) (quoti ng Lukumi , 508 U.S. at 534). In suggesting that Section 2.61 \"eliminated\" the religious exemption, WTP Appellants' Br. at 10, Plaintiffs misconstrue the connection between the August 18 Order and the August 26 Rule. 16 The August 18 Order was issued by Comm issioner Zucker alone as an emergency measure, intended to be in place for a maximum of 15 days, in response to reports of the surging Delta variant. Section 2.61, in contrast, was issued following collective deliberation by the 25member Public Health and Health Planning Council under the emergency rulemaking procedures set forth in New York law, which provided more process, public input, and support for a measure that would be effective for 90 days subject to renewal. These procedures required the Council, among other things, to develop and issue specific findings and a regulatory impact statement. NYS Admin. Proc. Act \u00a7 202(6)(iv), (viii). After this extensive process, the full Council came to the conclusion that the vaccine requirement should apply 16 In a recent decision, the First Circuit similarly misunderstood the connection between the August 18 Order and August 26 Rule when attempting to distinguish the New York vaccination mandate from the Maine vaccination mandate. See Does 1 -6 v. Mills , \u2014 F.4th \u2014, 2021 WL 4860328 (1st Cir. Oct. 19, 2021), application for injunctive relief denied sub nom. Does 1-3 v. Mills , \u2014 S. Ct. \u2014, No. 21A90, 2021 WL 5027177 (Oct. 29, 2021). The First Circuit mistakenly wrote, \"Eight days after New York officials promulgated a version of the regulation containing a religious exemption, they amended the regulation to eliminate the religious exemption.\" Id. at *9. However, as we explain above, there was no \"amending\" of the regulation to remove a religious exemption. Rather, the August 18 Order and the August 26 Rule were issued through two separate processes. 28ato a broader set of healthcare entities and, consistent with the State's highly effective existing vaccine requirements for measles and rubella (issued with no religious contain a religious exemption. The Council did not amend the August 18 Order: rather, it independently promulgated a new Rule. The record before the district courts does not demonstrate that the Rule was intended to \"target\" individuals opposed to receiving the COVID -19 vaccines because of their religious beliefs. Additionally, much occurred in the time between August 18 and August 26: former Governor Andrew Cuomo resigned and Governor Hochul assumed office; 17 the FDA gave full approval to the Pfizer - BioNTech vaccine for individuals 16 years of age and older;18 and the Delta variant continued its spread, becoming the dominant strain of the virus in the State.19 Even if the differing August 18 and August 26 requirements can be said to represent a shift in the State's policy position, Plaintiffs have not adduced facts establishing that the change stemmed from 17 New York State Governor's Office, Video, Audio, Photos & Rush Transcript: Kathy Hochul Is Sworn in as 57th Governor of New York State (Aug. 24, 2021), 18 Press Release, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, FDA Approves First COVID -19 Vaccine (Aug. 23, 2021), https://www.fda.gov/news -events/press -announcements/fda - approves -firstcovid -19-vaccine. 19 See Dr. A. Sp. App'x at 39. 29areligious intolerance, rather than an intent to more fully ensure that employees at healthcare facilities receive the vaccine in furtherance of the State's public health goals. 20 Second, on appeal, Plaintiffs asse rt that certain comments made by Governor Hochul in September reveal that Section 2.61 was intended to target them because of their religious opposition to the required vaccination.21 Some of those comments, however, did not relate to Section 2.61 or workp lace vaccine requirements at all, including Governor Hochul's statements at church services in which she urged those in attendance to get vaccinated. 22 Governor Hochul's expression of her own religious belief as a moral imperative to become vaccinated cann ot reasonably be understood to imply an intent on the part of the State to target those with religious beliefs contrary to hers; otherwise, politicians' frequent use of 20 This is another area in which factua l development can be expected to shed more light on the circumstances surrounding the creation of both the Order and the Rule and validate or disprove Plaintiffs' allegations. 21 Governor Hochul made the statements at issue after both the Dr. A. Plaintiffs and the WTP Plaintiffs filed their preliminary injunction motions. 22 See New York State Governor's Office, Rush Transcript: Governor Hochul Attends Service at Christian Cultural Center Video, Audio, Photos & Rush Transcript: Governor Hochul Attends Services at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem (Sept. 2021), - church. 30areligious rhetoric to support their positions would render many government actions \"non -neutral\" under Smith . At a press briefing on September 15, in which she responded to the temporary restraining order issued in Dr. A. , Governor Hochul stated her \"personal opinion\" that no religious exemption is required and that she was \"not aware of\" an y \"sanctioned religious exemption from any organized religion.\" 23 This comment simply mirrors the State's litigation position and conveys the fact \u2014which Plaintiffs do not contest \u2014 that many religious leaders have stated that vaccination is consistent with t heir faiths. 24 Governor Hochul's comments may more reasonably be understood to express general support for religious principles that she believes guide community members to care for one another by receiving the COVID -19 vaccine. Altogether, Governor Hochul's comments, even considered in light of the differing approaches taken by Commissioner Zucker in the August 18 Order and the full Council in the Rule, do not evince animosity towards particular religious practices or a desire to 23 See New York State Governor's Office, Video & Rush Transcript: Governor Hochul Holds Q&A Following COVID -19 Briefing See, e.g. , Devin Watkins, Pope Francis Urges People to Get Vaccinated Against Covid -19, Vatican News (Aug. 18, 2021), https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2021 -08/popefrancis - appealcovid -19-vaccines -act-of-love.html; Chairmen of the Commit tee on Doctrine and the Committee on Pro- Life Activities, Moral Considerations Regarding the New COVID -19 Vaccines, U.S. Conf. of Catholic Bishops (Dec. 11, 2020), https://www.usccb.org/moral- considerations -covid -vaccines. 31atarget religious objectors to the vaccine requirement because of their religious beliefs. Rather, they suggest that the State wanted more people to obtain the vaccine out of a deep concern for public health, which is a religion -neutral government interest. We therefore conclude t hat Plaintiffs at this stage have not carried their burden of establishing that Section 2.61 is likely not neutral. The district court's contrary conclusion in Dr. A. was based on a clearly erroneous assessment of the record before it. C. General Applica bility As the Supreme Court recently explained in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia , a law may not be \"generally applicable\" under Smith for either of two reasons: first, \"if it invites the government to consider the particular reasons for a person's conduct by providing a mechanism for individualized exemptions\"; or, second, \"if it prohibits religious conduct while permitting secular condu ct that undermines the government's asserted interests in a similar way.\" 141 S. Ct. at 1877 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). Here, Plaintiffs' argument, in substance, is that because Section 2.61 includes a medical exemption, it is not \"generally applicable.\" 1. Whether Section 2.61 Permits \"Comparable\" Secular Conduct The general applicability requirement \"protects religious observers against unequal treatment, and inequality that results when a legislature decides that the governmental interests it seeks to advance are worthy of being pursued only against conduct with a religious motivation.\" Central Rabbinical Congress, 763 F.3d at 196- 97 , 508 U.S. at 542- 43).25 \"A law is therefore not generally applicable if it is substantially underinclusive such that it regulates religious conduct while failing to regulate secular conduct that is at least as harmful to the legitimate government interests purportedly justifying it.\" Id. at 197. As the Supreme Court stated in a recent order, \"whether two activities are comparable for purposes of the Free Exercise Clause must be judged against the asserted government interest that justifies the regulation at issue.\" Tandon v. Newsom , 141 S. Ct. 1294, 1296 (2021). \" Comparability is concerned with the risks various activities pose.\" Id. Notably, in Smith , a law criminalizing controlled substance possession was deemed generally applicable even though it contained an exception for substances prescribed for medical purpo ses. 494 U.S. at 874, 878- 82. The State alleges that the following interests underlie its adoption of Section 2.61. First, it seeks to 25 Plaintiffs suggest that our decision in Central Rabbinical Congress was overruled by the Supreme Court's orders in Roman Catholic Diocese and Tandon . But Central Rabbinical Congress's formulation of the standard for identifying \"comparable secular activity \"\u2014\"secular conduct that is at least as harmful [as religious conduct] to the legitimate government interests purportedly justifying it,\" 763 F.3d at 197\u2014is consistent with the Supreme Court's statements in both of those cases. See Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo , 141 S. Ct. 63, 67 (2020) (stating that less- regulated factories, schools, and shopping centers were much more crowded than churches and synagogues or had contributed to the spread of COVID -19, in contrast to the religious institutions' \"admirable safety 1294, 1297 (2021) (considering secular activities comparable where they were not found to \"pose a lesser risk of transmission than [plaintiffs'] proposed religious exercise at home\"). 33aprevent the spread of COVID -19 in healthcare facilities among staff, patients, and residents. Second, by protecting the health of healthcare employees to ensure they are able to continue working, it aims to reduce the risk of staffing shortages that can compromise the safety of patients and residents even beyond a COVID -19 infection. Thus, the State maintains, the medical and any religious exemption differ in an important respect: applying the Rule to those who oppose vaccination on religious grounds furthe rs the State's asserted interests, whereas applying the Rule to those subject to medical contraindications or precautions based on pre -existing conditions would undermine the government's asserted interest in protecting the health of covered personnel. Cf. Does 1 -6 v. Mills , \u2014 F.4th \u2014, 2021 WL 4860328, *6 (1st Cir. Oct. 19, 2021), application for injunctive relief denied sub nom. Does 1 -3 v. Mills , \u2014 S. Ct. \u2014 (Oct. 29, 2021). Vaccinating a healthcare employee who is known or expected to be injured by the vaccine would harm her health and make it less likely she could work. The State identified these objectives in the Regulatory Impact Statement accompanying the emergency rulemaking, and Plaintiffs do not point to any evidence suggesting that the interests asserted are pretextual or should otherwise be disregarded in the comparability analysis. Accordingly, the State makes a reasonable case that Section 2.61 contains a medical exemption not because it determined that \"the governm ental interests it seeks to advance are worthy of being pursued only against conduct with a religious motivation,\" Lukumi , 508 U.S. at 543, but because applying the vaccination requirement to individuals with medical contraindications and precautions would 34anot effectively advance those interests. Indeed, applying the vaccine to individuals in the face of certain contraindications, depending on their nature, could run counter to the State's \"interest in protecting the integrity and ethics of the medical prof ession.\" Gonzales v. Carhart , 550 U.S. 124, 157 (2007) Washington v. Glucksberg , 521 U.S. 702, 731 (1997)); see also Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 38 -39 (1905) (recognizing that the state may not be permitted to require vaccination of individuals with contraindications). Importantly, the State has also presented evidence that raises the possibility that the exemptions are not comparable in terms of the \"risk\" that they pose. See Tandon, 141 S. Ct. at 1296. It notes that the medical exemption is defined to be limited in duration, as the vaccine requirement is \"inapplicable only until such immunization is found no longer to be detrimental to such personnel member's health.\" 10 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 2.61(d)(1). Although some of the c ontraindications and precautions identified by ACIP and incorporated into the Department of Health guidance are long -term health conditions, others are in fact explicitly temporary, such as having a current moderate -to- severe acute illness. 26 In contrast, a sincerely held religious belief that vaccination is inconsistent with one's religion is unlikely to change to permit vaccination in the future, absent the approval of new vaccines that are developed in a different way. The statistics provided by the State further indicate that medical exemptions are likely to be more limited in number than religious exemptions, and that high 26 See FAQs, supra at 10. 35anumbers of religious exemptions appear to be clustered in particular geographic areas. See Dr. A. Appellants' Reply Br. at 13 (citin g Serafin , Index No. 908296- 21, Doc. No. 57 (Decl. of Dorothy Persico)) (ratios of religious exemptions to medical exemptions among Erie County and Monroe County hospital workers were 18 to 1 and 23 to 1, respectively). 27 As a result, it may be feasible for healthcare entities to manage the COVID -19 risks posed by a small set of objectively defined and largely time-limited medical exemptions. In contrast, it could pose a significant barrier to effective disease prevention to permit a much greater number of permanent religious exemptions, which, according to the State's evidence, appear more commonly sought in certain locations. See Serafin , Index No. 908296- 21, Doc. No. 57 (Decl. of Dorothy Persico). Although these differences may, after factual developmen t, be shown to be too insignificant to render the exemptions incomparable, the limited evidence now before us suggests that the medical exemption is not \"as harmful to the legitimate government interests purportedly justifying\" the Rule as a religious exem ption would be. Central Rabbinical Congress, 763 F.3d at 197. In their efforts to show a likelihood of success on the merits, Plaintiffs counter that Section 2.61, by providing a medical but not a religious exemption, effectively prohibits religion -based refusals of vaccination while permitting \"comparable\" refusals on secular grounds. To establish comparability under 27 As discussed, Plaintiffs do not contest the State's assertion that higher numbers of employees claim religious exemptions than medical exemptions. See supra note 3. 36aSmith , Plaintiffs rely heavily on the general \u2014and reasonable \u2014proposition that any individual unvaccinated employee is likely to present stat istically comparable risks of both contracting and spreading COVID -19 at any given healthcare facility, irrespective of the reason that the employee is unvaccinated. In Plaintiffs' view, the Supreme Court's orders in Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo and Tandon v. Newsom require us to confine our analysis to evaluating the risk of COVID -19 transmission posed by each unvaccinated individual. Both of those cases involved challenges to occupancy limits placed on religious services, in an effort to c urb COVID -19 transmission indoors, which were not applied to secular businesses with similarly high capacities. See Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo , 141 S. Ct. 63, 67 (2020); Tandon, 141 S. Ct. at 1297. Unlike Plaintiffs' proposed analysis here, however, Roman Catholic Diocese and Tandon did not involve a one -to-one comparison of the transmission risk posed by an individual worshipper and, for example, an individual grocery shopper. The Supreme Court's discussion in those cases, which compared t he risks posed by groups of various sizes in various settings, suggests the appropriateness of considering aggregate data about transmission risks. See, e.g. , Roman Catholic Diocese, 141 S. Ct. at 66- 67 (comparing \"a large store in Brooklyn that could literally have hundreds of people shopping there on any given day\" with \"a nearby church or synagogue [that] would be prohibited from allowing more than 10 or 25 people for a worship service\"). We doubt t hat, as an epidemiological matter, the number of people seeking exemptions is somehow excluded from the factors that the State must take into account in 37aassessing the relative risks to the health of healthcare workers and the efficacy of its vaccination st rategy in actually preventing the spread of disease. The record before us contains only limited data regarding the prevalence of medical ineligibility and religious objections, but what data we do have indicates that claims for religious exemptions are far more numerous. Further, Tandon expressly instructs courts to consider \"the asserted government interest that justifies the regulation at issue\" when determining whether two activities are comparable for Free Exercise Clause purposes. Tandon, 141 S. Ct. a t 1296. By confining their discussion of comparability to individual risk of transmission alone, Plaintiffs fail to engage with the reasons above, persuasive to us, that substantially distinguish the medically ineligible from the religious objectors in lig ht of the State's asserted purposes. At this stage, Plaintiffs do not meaningfully challenge the legitimacy of the government's asserted interest in protecting the health of workers and maintaining staffing levels, or the proposition that requiring those w ho have been granted a medical exemption to be vaccinated would undermine those interests to a lesser degree than would a religious exemption. As counsel for the WTP Plaintiffs acknowledged at oral argument, Plaintiffs here essentially contend that all existing vaccination mandates without a religious exemption necessarily fail the general applicability test because they likely all contain medical exemptions. At the same time, it appears that for decades, those charged with protecting the public health aga inst infectious disease in New York State 38ahave required vaccination of all medically eligible employees and treated the requirement as a condition of employment in the healthcare arena. For example, the State has required healthcare employees to be vaccina ted against rubella and measles since 1980 and 1991, respectively, without a religious exemption. Many of these vaccines, including the rubella vaccine, appear from the information available to us (and not to date contested by Plaintiffs) to have connections to the same fetal cell lines that form the basis for Plaintiffs' religious objections here. See Los Angeles County Dep't of Pub. Health, COVID -19 Vaccine and Fetal Cell Lines, supra note 5. Thus, if accepted, Plaintiffs' arguments would go beyond just b eing inconsistent with past practices: they would have potentially far -reaching and harmful consequences for governments' ability to enforce longstanding public health rules and protocols. With a record as undeveloped on the issue of comparability as that presented here, we cannot conclude that the above vaccination requirements are per se not generally applicable, as Plaintiffs' argument would have it, so as to support a preliminary injunction at this time. See Smith , 494 U.S. at 888- 89 (counting \"compul sory vaccination laws\" among those generally applicable civic obligations for which no religious exemption is required); see also Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166- 67 (1944) (\"[A parent] cannot claim freedom from compulsory vaccination for the chi ld more than for himself on religious grounds. The right to practice religion freely does not include liberty to expose the community or the child to communicable disease . . . .\" (footnote omitted)); Phillips v. of New York , 775 F.3d 538, 543 (2d Cir. 2015) (per curiam) (maintaining that 39areligious exemptions to vaccine mandates are not constitutionally required). The record before the district courts was sparse. It does not support a conclusion that Plaintiffs have borne their burden of demonstratin g that the medical exemption provided in Section 2.61 and the religious exemption sought are likely comparable. 2. Whether Section 2.61 Provides for a System of Individualized Exemptions General applicability may be absent when a law provides \"a mechanism for individualized exemptions,\" Smith , 494 U.S. at 884, because it creates the risk that administrators will use their discretion to exempt individuals from complying with the law for secular reasons, but not religious reasons. For instance, in Smith , th e Supreme Court distinguished generally applicable laws from an unemployment compensation statute under which applicants were eligible for benefits if they presented \"good cause\" for their unemployment, which allowed administrators, in their discretion, to refuse an exemption if an applicant could not work for religious reasons, but to grant an exemption if an applicant could not work for other personal reasons. 494 U.S. at 884 (quoting Bowen v. Roy, 476 U.S. 693, 708 (1986) (plurality opinion) and citing Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 401 & n.4 (1963)). The Court observed that the context of the unemployment compensation system \"lent itself to individualized government assessment of the reasons for the relevant conduct.\" Id. Similarly, the Court recently found a system of individualized exemptions to exist where an official had \"sole discretion\" to grant or deny exemptions to the anti -discrimination provision in contracts between 40athe City of Phila delphia and adoption service providers. Fulton , 141 S. Ct. at 1878- 79. As other Circuits have noted, however, \"an exemption is not individualized simply because it contains express exceptions for objectively defined categories of persons.\" 303 Creative L LC v. Elenis , 6 F.4th 1160, 1187 (10th Cir. (internal quotation marks and v. Wiesman , 794 F.3d 1064, 1081- 82 (9th Cir. 2015) (finding that the challenged \"rules do not afford unfettered discretion that cou ld lead to religious discrimination because the provisions are tied to particularized, objective criteria\"), cert. I.N.S., 910 F.2d 42, 45 (2d Cir. 1990) (concluding that immigr ation law that prohibited knowingly employing an unauthorized immigrant did \"not provide for a discretionary exemption that is applied in a manner that fails to accommodate free exercise concerns\" despite its inclusion of an exemption for employing certain household employees hired before November 1986). The \"mere existence of an exemption procedure,\" absent any showing that secularly motivated conduct could be impermissibly favored over religiously motivated conduct, is not enough to render a law not gener ally applicable and subject to strict scrutiny. Lighthouse Inst. for Evangelism, Inc. v. City of Long Branch , 510 F.3d 253, 276 (3d Cir. 2007). The WTP Plaintiffs argue that the medical exemption in Section 2.61 creates a mechanism for individualized exem ptions. They are mistaken. The medical exemption here does not \"'invite' the government to decide which reasons for not complying 41awith the policy are worthy of solicitude.\" Fulton , 141 S. Ct. at 1879 (quoting Smith , 494 U.S. at 884). Instead, the Rule prov ides for an objectively defined category of people to whom the vaccine requirement does not apply: employees who present a certification from a physician or certified nurse practitioner attesting that they have a pre -existing health condition that renders the vaccination detrimental to their health, in accordance with generally accepted medical standards, such as those published by ACIP, 28 28 Under the generally accepted medical standards published by ACIP, cognizable contraindications to the COVID -19 vaccines are limited to \"[s]evere allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose or to a component of the COVID- 19 vaccine\" and \"[i]mmediate (within 4 hours) allergic reaction of any severity to a previous dose or known (diagnosed) allergy to a component of the COVID -19 vaccine.\" FAQs , supra at 10 (citing ACIP standards). Precautions to the vaccines are limited to \"[c]urrent moderate to severe acute illness[,] . . . [h]istory of an immediate allergic reaction to any other (not COVID -19) vaccine or injectable therapy (excluding allergy shots)[, and] [h]istory of myocarditis or pericarditis after receiving the first dose of an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine.\" Id. (citing ACIP standards). Additionally, individuals with a \"contraindication to one type of COVID -19 vaccine (e.g., mRNA COVID -19 vaccines) have precautions to another type of COVID -19 vaccine (e.g., Janssen/Johnson & Johnson vaccine).\" Id. (citing ACIP standards). An individual who has a contraindication to the vaccine cannot be safely vaccinated, but \"[m]ost people deemed to have a precaution to a COVID -19 vaccine at the time of their vaccination appointment can and should be administered vaccine\" after conducting a risk assessment with a healthcare provider. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID -19 Vaccines Currently Approved or Authorized in the United States: Contraindications and Pr ecautions (Oct. 25, 2021), https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid- 19/clinical- 42afor the period during which the vaccination remains detrimental to their health. See 10 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 2.61(d)(1). A written description of the nature and duration of the condition must be furnished, and the exemption must be documented. On its face, the Rul e affords no meaningful discretion to the State or employers, and Plaintiffs have not put forth any evidence suggesting otherwise. For example, Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged or offered evidence to suggest that employees are requesting, or that the State is allowing, medical exemptions that do not conform to the Rule or applicable standards. That physicians and nurse practitioners must use their medical judgment to determine whether a particular individual has a contraindication or precaution agains t receiving the vaccine does not render the exemption discretionary. Indeed, Smith itself specifically held that a scheme that included a type of medical exemption \u2014by not criminalizing the use of controlled substances when prescribed by a medical practitio ner\u2014was nonetheless generally applicable under the Free Exercise Clause. See Smith , 494 U.S. at 874. If the State can lawfully choose to apply the vaccination requirement to those with religious objections but not those medically unable to considerations/covid -19-vaccines -us.html#Contraindications. The specificity of these limitations stands in contrast to the absence of limitations and specificity in the medical exemp tion provided in the Maine statute recently subject to review and consideration by the Supreme Court. See Mills , 2021 WL 4860328, at *5 WL 5027177, at *2 dissenting from the denial of ap plication for injunctive relief) (stating that the law does not \"limit what may qualify as a valid 'medical' reason to avoid inoculation\"). 43aget vaccinated b ecause the two are not comparable\u2014 and, as explained above, Plaintiffs have not established a likelihood of success on their argument to the contrary \u2014then Section 2.61 appears to leave no room for the State to favor impermissible secular reasons for declini ng vaccination over religious reasons.29 * * * Based on the foregoing, Plaintiffs have not established, at the preliminary injunction stage, that they are likely to succeed in showing that Section 2.61 is not neutral or generally applicable. Accordingly, rational basis review applies. See Fulton , 141 S. Ct. at 1876 (citing Smith , 494 U.S. at 878- 82). Section 2.61 29 In Dahl v. Bd. of Trustees of Western Michigan Univ. , \u2014 F.4th \u2014, 2021 WL 4618519 (6th Cir. Oct. 7, 2021) (per curiam), the Sixth Circuit, under different factual circumstances, ruled that a student -athlete vaccine mandate that provided that medical and religious exemptions would be considered on an individu al basis at the discretion of the University meant that the school's vaccine mandate was not generally applicable under Fulton . Id. at *1, *4. We of course are not bound by that analysis, and we believe Dahl to have addressed a factual setting significantly different from that presented here. In Dahl, the University was afforded so much discretion to rule on individual cases, and so few standards governed the exercise of that discretion, as to leave room for the University to apply potentially discriminatory standards, or at least to avoid a neutral application of generally applicable principles. See id. at *4. Here, we think the standards articulated by ACIP and binding the State employers are sufficiently well - defined to avoid grossly pretextual or discrim inatory application \u2014and Plaintiffs have not met their burden to show that is not the case. Examined at a proper perspective \u2014one suitable to dealing with large populations in a public health crisis \u2014we see no basis for adopting the Dahl court's approach here. 44aeasily meets that standard, which requires that the State have chosen a means for addressing a legitimate goal that is rationally re lated to achieving that goal. See Jacoby & Meyers, LLP v. Presiding Justices of the First, Second, Third and Fourth Dep'ts, App. Div. of the Sup. Ct. of N.Y. , 852 F.3d 178, 191 (2d Cir. 2017). Faced with an especially contagious variant of the virus in the midst of a pandemic that has now claimed the lives of over 750,000 in the United States and some 55,000 in New York, the State decided as an emergency measure to require vaccination for all employees at healthcare facilities who might become infected and expose others to the virus, to the extent they can be safely vaccinated. This was a reasonable exercise of the State's power to enact rules to protect the public health. 30 See Jacobson , 197 U.S. at 25; Phillips , 775 F.3d at 542- 43. II. Likelihood of Succ ess on the Merits: Supremacy Clause and Title VII Claim The Dr. A. Plaintiffs contend that Section 2.61 contravenes the Supremacy Clause because it is preempted by Title VII, which prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of religion. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e -2(a)(1)- (2). To succeed on this type of preemption claim, plaintiffs must show that \"local law conflicts with federal law such that it is impossible for a party to comply with both or the local law is an 30 We also observe that, irrespective of whether Section 2.61 is ultimately upheld at the conclusion of this litigation, private healthcare institutions may impose vaccination requirements of their own, subject to any relevant limitations imposed by Title VII and other applicable law but regardless of the limitations that the First Amendment imposes on the State. 45aobstacle to the achievement of federal objectives.\" N.Y. SMSA Ltd. P'ship v. Town F.3d 97, 104 (2d Cir. 2010).31 Plaintiffs construe Section 2.61 to prohibit healthcare employers from making reasonable accommodations as otherwise required by Title VII. Plaintiffs cite the absenc e of an express religious exemption in Section 2.61 in support of their position that the Rule simply leaves \"no room for Plaintiffs' employers even to consider their reasonable religious accommodation requests as required by federal law under Title VII.\" Dr. A. Appellees' Br. at 29 (emphasis omitted). 32 The District Court for the Northern District of New York agreed, ruling that Plaintiffs were likely to 31 \"In general, three types of preemption exist: (1) express preemption, where Congress has expressly preempted local law; (2) field preemption, whe re Congress has legislated so comprehensively that federal law occupies an entire field of regulation and leaves no room for state law; and (3) conflict preemption, where local law conflicts with federal law such that it is impossible for a party to comply with both or the local law is an obstacle to the achievement of federal objectives.\" N.Y. SMSA Ltd. P'ship, 612 F.3d at 104 (internal quotation marks omitted). Plaintiffs here invoke conflict preemption. 32 Although the Dr. A. Plaintiffs style their preemption claim as a challenge brought pursuant to the Supremacy Clause, the Supreme Court has held that the Supremacy Clause does not create an independent cause of action. See Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc. , 575 U.S. 320, 324 -25 (2015) (\"[T]he Supremacy Clause is not the source of any federal rights, and certainly does not create a cause of action. It instructs courts what to do when state and federal law clash, but is silent regarding who may enforce federa l laws in court, and in what circumstances they may do so.\") (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). 46asucceed on the merits of this claim. See Dr. A. , 2021 WL 4734404, at *6. The district court held that Section 2.61 \"do[es] not make room for 'covered entities' to consider requests for reasonable religious accommodations,\" and instead requires all personnel at covered entities to be vaccinated. Id. The district court observed that the employers of some Plaintiffs had revoked previously afforded religious exemptions or religious accommodations to COVID -19-vaccine requirements, citing the State's adoption of Section 2.61. Id. In the district court's view, Plaintiffs adequately demonstrated that Section 2.61 \"effectively foreclose[s] the pathway to seeking a religious exemption that is guaranteed under Title VII.\" Id. Title VII makes it unlawful for employers \"to discharge . . . or otherwise to discriminate against any individual\" in his or her employment \"because \"religion\" to include \"all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate . . . an employee's . . . . the employer's busi ness.\" World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison , 432 U.S. 63, 66 (1977); cf. EEOC v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc. , 575 U.S. 768, 770 (2015). The Dr. A. Plaintiffs argue, as described above, that the absence of a religious exemption in Section 2.61 prohibits them from seeking reasonable accommodations from their employers under Title VII for their sincerely held religious beliefs. Section 2.61 is silent, however, on the employment -related actions that employers may take in response to employees who 47arefuse to be vaccinated for religious reasons. The State observes that \"[n]othing in [Section 2.61] precludes employers from accommodating religious objectors giving them . . . assignments \u2014such as telemedicine \u2014 where they would not pose a risk of infection to other personnel, patients, or residents.\" Dr. A. Appellants' Br. at 62. We agree with the State. Section 2.61, on its face, does not bar an employer from providing an employee with a reasonable accommodation that removes the individ ual from the scope of the Rule. Section 2.61 does not require employers to violate Title VII because, although it bars an employer from granting a religious exemption from the vaccination requirement, it does not prevent employees from seeking a religious accommodation allowing them to continue working consistent with the Rule, while avoiding the vaccination requirement. See also Mills , 2021 WL 4860328, at *10 (\"The appellants' Supremacy Clause on their assertion that the hospitals . . . have claimed that the protections of Title VII are inapplicable in the State of Maine. The record simply does not support that argument. . . . [T]he hospitals merely dispute that Title VII requires them to offer the appellants the religious exemptions they seek.\" (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted)). Contrary to the Dr. A . Plaintiffs' interpretation of the statute, Title VII does not require covered entities to provide the accommodation that Plaintiffs prefer \u2014 in this case, a blanket religious ex emption allowing them to continue working at their current positions unvaccinated. To avoid Title VII liability for religious discrimination, an employer \"need not offer the accommodation the employee prefers.\" Cosme v. 48aHenderson , 287 F.3d 152, 158 (2d Cir . 2002). Instead, an employer must offer a reasonable accommodation that does not cause the employer an undue hardship. Once \"any reasonable accommodation is provided, the statutory inquiry ends.\" Id. Because Section 2.61's text does not foreclose all oppo rtunity for Plaintiffs to secure a reasonable accommodation under Title VII, the Rule does not conflict with federal law. Therefore, the district court's conclusion to the contrary constituted legal error. The district court's conclusion also turned on clearly erroneous factual findings. At this stage, the Dr. A. Plaintiffs have submitted little in support of their broad allegations about the effect of Section 2.61. The district court reached the conclusion that accommodation by their employers was foreclosed upon the Dr. A. Plaintiffs' say -so, without any documentation supporting Plaintiffs' allegations that they were denied reasonable accommodations from their employers. The district court granted the Dr. A . Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction without a hearing and without knowing the identities of Plaintiffs' employers or the substance of Plaintiffs' interactions with their employers. It may turn out that the opportunities for a reasonable accommodation under Title VII for religious objectors to the vaccine are numerous, or it may be that there are so few as to be illusory. Perhaps accommodations for the medically ineligible leave few available for the religious objectors. 33 Or perhaps the requests for 33 Although the Rule does not prevent healthcare entities from taking additional precautions to minimize the transmission risk posed by medically exempt employees, healthcare entities may 49aaccommodations in each category will vary by employer, by part of the State, or by employee demographics. But without any data in the record, we cannot conclude that Plaintiffs have met their burden to show a likelihood of success on the merits, and we decline to draw any conclusion about the avai lability of reasonable accommodation based solely on surmise and speculation. At this preliminary stage, we therefore conclude that the district court erred by finding that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claim that Section 2.61 is preempted by Title VII and therefore violative of the Supremacy Clause. III. Likelihood of Success on the Merits: Rights to Privacy, Medical Freedom, and Bodily Autonomy Claim The WTP Plaintiffs maintain on appeal that they are likely to succeed in establishing that Section 2.61 violates their fundamental rights to privacy, medica l freedom, and bodily autonomy under the Fourteenth Amendment. 34 This argument also fails. permit a medically exempt employee to continue normal job responsibilit ies provided they comply with requirements for personal protective equipment. See FAQs , supra at 10. 34 The WTP Plaintiffs' complaint describes these rights as arising from the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments, but on appeal they assert that these rights are derived from either the Fourteenth Amendment alone or a combination of the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments. Because the WTP Plaintiffs do not make any particularized argument for why the fundamental rights they assert may be implicated by constitutional provisions other than 50aBoth this Court and the Supreme Court have consistently recognized that the Constitution embodies no fundamental right that in and of itself would render vaccine re quirements imposed in the public interest, in the face of a public health emergency, unconstitutional. See Jacobson , 197 U.S. at 25- 31, 37; Phillips , 775 F.3d at 542- 43. Plaintiffs' argument that the Supreme Court's decision in Roman Catholic Diocese \"expr essly overruled\" Jacobson is a mystery, given that the majority did not even mention Jacobson . WTP Appellants' Br. at 35; see generally Roman Catholic Diocese, 141 S. Ct. 63. Their alternative contention that Jacobson and Phillips have been implicitly ov erruled by the Supreme Court likewise finds no support in caselaw. In Cruzan , a case relied upon by Plaintiffs for the proposition that they have a fundamental constitutional right to refuse medical treatment, the Court expressly recognized its holding in Jacobson that \"an individual's liberty interest in declining an unwanted smallpox vaccine\" was outweighed there by \"the State's interest in preventing disease.\" Cruzan Missouri Dep't of Health , 497 U.S. 261, 278 (1990). Plaintiffs provid e no basis for concluding that the vaccination requirement here, considerably narrower than the citywide mandate in Jacobson , violates a fundamental constitutional right. 35 the Fourteenth Amendment, we evaluate only their challenge as to the Fourteenth Amendment. 35 Plaintiffs' reliance on Roe v. Wade , 410 U.S. 113 (1973), Planned Parenthood v. Casey , 505 U.S. 833 (1992), and Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003), also fails to persuade. These cases do not establish a broad fundamental privacy right for all medical 51aAlthough individuals who object to receiving the vaccines on religious grounds have a hard choice to make, they do have a choice. Vaccination is a condition of employment in the healthcare field; the State is not forcibly vaccinating healthcare workers. As in Phillips , the instant \"challenge to the mandatory vaccination regime is therefore no more compelling than Jacobson's was more than a century ago.\" 775 F.3d at 542. Cf. Klaassen v. Trs. of Indiana Univ. 7 F.4th (7th Cir. 2021) (\"[S]uch [a substantive due process] argument depends on the existence of a fundamental right ingra ined in the American legal tradition. Yet Jacobson , which sustained a criminal conviction for refusing to be vaccinated, shows that plaintiffs lack such a right.\"). Accordingly, the WTP Plaintiffs have not established that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their Fourteenth Amendment claim. IV. Irreparable Harm, the Public Interest, and the Balance of Equities Plaintiffs are not entitled to a preliminary injunction because they cannot, on the present record, show a likelihood of success on the merits. We decisions made by an individual\u2014 and particularly not for a decision with such broad community consequences as declining vaccination against a highly contagious disease while working in contact with vulnerable people at healthcare facilities. This Court cannot find an overriding privacy right when doing so would conflict with Jacobson . Alth ough in 1905, when it was decided, Jacobson might have been read more narrowly, for over 100 years it has stood firmly for the proposition that the urgent public health needs of the community can outweigh the rights of an individual to refuse vaccination. Jacobson remains binding precedent. 52anonetheless briefly address the remaining preliminary injunction requirements: \"irreparable harm absent injunctive relief\"; the \"public interest weighing in favor of granting the injunction\"; and \"the balance of equities tip[ping] in [the movant's] favor,\" Yang , 960 F.3d at 127, and determine that Plaintiffs have not successfully met them. A. Irreparable Harm The law recognizes the harm that necessarily results when the State unconstitutionally burdens religious exercise. \"Religious adherents are not required to establish irreparable harm independent of showing a Free Exercise Clause violation because a presumption of irreparable injury flows from a violation of constitutional rights.\" Agudath Israel , 983 F.3d at 636 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted); see also Bery v. City of New York , 97 F.3d 689, 693 (2d Cir. 1996) (\"Violations of First Amen dment rights are commonly considered irreparable injuries for the purposes of a preliminary injunction.\"). Although Plaintiffs are subject to meaningful burdens on their religious practice if they choose to obtain the COVID -19 vaccine, because they have failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on their First Amendment or other constitutional claims, their asserted harm is not of a constitutional dimension. Thus, Plaintiffs fail to meet the irreparable harm element simply by alleging an impairment of th eir Free Exercise right. Plaintiffs also contend that they face imminent irreparable harm from loss of employment and professional standing if they refuse the COVID -19 vaccine on religious grounds. We acknowledge that Plaintiffs may possibly suffer sign ificant employment 53aconsequences if they refuse on religious grounds to be vaccinated. It is well settled, however, that adverse employment consequences are not the type of harm that usually warrants injunctive relief because economic harm resulting from employment actions is typically compensable with money damages. See Sampson v. Murray , 415 U.S. 61, 91- 92 (1974) (\"[L]oss of income and . . . the claim that her reputation would be damaged . . . falls far short of the type of irreparable injury which is a ne cessary predicate to the issuance of a temporary injunction[.]\"); Savage v. Gorski , 850 F.2d 64, 68 (2d Cir. 1988) (\"Since reinstatement and money damages could make appellees whole for any loss suffered during this period, their injury is plainly reparabl e and appellees have not demonstrated the type of harm entitling them to injunctive relief.\"). Because Plaintiffs' economic harms under Title VII could be remedied with money damages, and reinstatement is a possible remedy as well, we conclude that Plainti ffs have failed to demonstrate that they will suffer irreparable harm absent injunctive relief. We pause to recognize, should the issue remain on remand, that this case raises difficult, apparently unusual questions as to imminent irreparable harm. Perha ps, if they prevail at the conclusion of this litigation, Plaintiffs would seek lost wages, but it is not at all clear who would pay them. To the extent Plaintiffs allege that they will suffer adverse employment consequences or loss of professional standin g if not provided accommodations under Title VII, Plaintiffs might seek money damages from their employers. Private medical -provider employers might make a persuasive argument that they should not have to pay because they were in effect compelled by 54alaw to terminate the employment. Absent a waiver, however, sovereign immunity would likely prevent Plaintiffs from obtaining money damages from the State. See Virginia Office for Prot. & Advocacy v. Stewart , 563 U.S. 247, 254 (2011). We emphasize, however, tha t we do not place any weight on the issue of remediation of Plaintiffs' financial losses at this preliminary injunction stage. The district courts can consider the issue, should it be necessary to do so, upon a determination of the permanent injunction request, presumably upon further factual development and findings. B. Public Interest and Balance of Equities Plaintiffs have also failed to demonstrate that the public interest weighs in favor of enjoining enforcement of Section 2.61. When the government is a party to the suit, our inquiries into the public interest and the balance of the equities merge. See New York v. United States Dep't of Homeland Sec. , 969 F.3d 42, 58- 59 (2d Cir. 2020). Here, the State has an indisputably compelling interes t in ensuring that the employees who care for hospital patients, nursing home residents, and other medically vulnerable people in its healthcare facilities are vaccinated against COVID -19, not just to protect them and those with whom they come into contact from infection, but also to prevent an overburdening of the healthcare system. Although Plaintiffs undoubtedly face a difficult choice if their employers deny religious accommodations \u2014 whether to be vaccinated despite their religious beliefs or whether to risk termination of their jobs \u2014such hardships are outweighed by the State's interest in maintaining the safety within healthcare facilities during the pandemic. 55aPlaintiffs assert that the State \"will suffer no harm as the New York healthcare system has o perated for the last year without interruption or catastrophe\" without requiring vaccination for healthcare workers. WTP Appellants' Br. at 11. Defining the relevant time frame in this way notably omits the first wave of the pandemic, during which New York hospitals were in crisis, with frontline nurses and physicians reportedly experiencing some of the highest rates of infection and death; New York City nursing homes experienced such a high number of deaths that their morgue capacity was exceeded. See Br. for Amicus Curiae Greater New York Hospital Association (\"GNYHA Amicus Br.\") at 3 (citing Miriam Mutambudzi et al., Occupation and Risk of Severe COVID -19: Prospective Cohort Study of 120 075 UK Biobank Participants , 78 Occupational & Envt'l Med. 307, 311 (2021)); New York State Office of the Attorney General, Nursing Home Response to COVID -19 Pandemic 12 (Jan. 30, 2021), https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021 - nursinghomesreport.pdf. But even within the past year, healthcare facilities in the State ha ve been under strain. According to amicus Greater New York Hospital Association, not only has transmission of the virus continued in hospitals even with the use of personal protective equipment, testing, and other measures, see GNYHA Amicus Br. at 9, 12- 14, but hospital workers have also experienced a \"parallel pandemic\" of burnout, anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues, id. at 16. Researchers have found that this phenomenon stems from \"a perceived lack of control, treatment of other healthcar e workers for COVID -19, and uncertainty about colleagues' infection status,\" and it has been accompanied by increased rates of resignation and 56aretirement as well as incidents of self -harm.

Because Section 2.61 furthers the State's compelling interest and Plaintiffs have not shown a likelihood of demonstrating that their constitutional rights are violated by the Rule, they have also failed to show that a preliminary injunction preventing the Rule's implementation serves the public interest. Whether this issue will ultimately carry any weight when the district courts decide Plaintiffs' entitlement to a permanent injunction on remand, we need not and do not decide. CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, the order of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York is AFFIRMED . The order of the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York is 57aREVERSED , and the preliminary injunction enter ed by that court is VACATED . These tandem cases are REMANDED to their respective district courts for further proceedings consistent with the Order entered on October 29, 2021, and this Opinion. APPENDIX Section 2.61.

Hochul , No. 212179, and Dr. A. v. Hochul , No. 21 -2566, which we heard and decided in tandem. 2021 WL 5121983 (2d Cir. Nov. 4, 2021). We do so in light of the text of the recent order of the district court in Dr. A. v. Hochul , vacating the preliminary injunction at issue. No. 1:21CV -1009 (N.D.N.Y. Nov. 5, 2021). The district court there wrote that the Dr. A . Plaintiffs \"no longer need\" a preliminary injunction because Section 2.61 \"does not prevent employees from seeking a religious accommodation allowing them to continue working consistent with the Rule, while avoiding the vaccination requirement.\" Id . (quoting We the Patriots USA, Inc., 2021 WL 5121983, at *17). A reader might erroneously conclude from this text that, consistent with our opinion, employers may grant religious accommodations that allow employees to continue working, unvaccinated, at positions in which they \"engage in activities such that if they were infected with COVID -19, they could potentially expose other covered personnel, patients or reside nts to the disease.\" 10 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 2.61 (definition of \"personnel\"). In our opinion, however, we stated that \"Section 2.61, on its face, does not bar an employer from providing an employee with a reasonable accommodation that removes the individual from the scope of the Rule.\" 2021 WL 5121983, at *17 (emphasis 69a added). In other words, it may be possible under the Rule for an employer to accommodate\u2014not exempt \u2014 employees with religious objections, by employing them in a manner that removes them from the Rule 's definition of \"personnel.\" Id. Such an accommodation would have the effect under the Rule of permitting such employees to remain unvaccinated while employed. Of course, Title VII does not obligate an employer to grant an accommodation that would cause \"undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business.\" See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(j). And, as we also observed in our opinion, \" Contrary to the Dr. A . Plaintiffs' interpretation of the statute, Title VII does not require covered entities to provide the ac commodation that Plaintiffs prefer \u2014in this case, a blanket religious exemption allowing them to continue working at their current positions unvaccinated.\" 2021 WL 5121983, at *17. To repeat: if a medically eligible employee's work assignments mean that she qualifies as \"personnel,\" she is covered by the Rule and her employer must \"continuously require\" that she is vaccinated against COVID -19. 10 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 2.61. As we observed, this requirement runs closely parallel to the longstanding New York State requirements, subject to no religious exemption, that medically eligible healthcare employees be vaccinated against rubella and measles. 2021 WL 5121983, at *13. The preliminary injunction entered by the district court in Dr. A. v. Hochul on October 12, 2021, has been vacated. See We The Patriots USA, Inc. v. Hochul , No. 21-2179, and Dr. -2566, WL 5103443, Cir. Oct. 29, 2021). New York State's emergency rule requiring that healthcare 70a facilities \"continuou sly require\" that certain medically eligible employees \u2014those covered by the Rule's definition of \"personnel\" \u2014are vaccinated against COVID -19, is currently in effect. 10 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 2.61. We caution further that our opinion addressed only the likelihood of success on the merits of Plaintiffs' claims; it did not provide our court's definitive determination of the merits of those claims. In the interest of judicial economy, we direct the Clerk of Court to refer any further proceedings in these two matters to this panel. 71aIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK DR.

LETITIA JAMES New York State Attorney General Attorneys for Defendants The Capitol Albany, NY 12224 OF COUNSEL: HICKEY, ESQ. Ass't Attorneys General DAVID N. HURD United States District Judge MEMORANDUM -DECISION and ORDER I. INTRODUCTION On August 26, 2021, the New York State Department of Health adopted an emergency regulation that required most healthcare workers to be vaccinated against COVID -19 within the next thirty days. N.Y. COMP. CODES R. & REGS. tit. 10, \u00a7 2.61(c) (2021). As relevant here, \u00a7 2.61 eliminated a religious exemption included in the first iteration of this mandate. On September 13, 2021, seventeen healthcare workers employed in New York State (\"plaintiffs\"), all of whom object to the existing COVID -19 vaccines on religious grounds, filed this official- capacity 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 198 3 action against New York State Governor Kathy Hochul (\"Hochul\"), New York State Health 73aCommissioner Howard A. Zucker (\"Zucker\"), and New York State Attorney General Letitia James (\"James\") (collectively \"defendants\"). Plaintiffs' three -count verified complaint alleges that \u00a7 2.61 violates their constitutional rights because it effectively forbids employers from considering workplace religious accommodations under processes guaranteed by federal law. Plaintiffs sought to enjoin defendants from, inter al ia, enforcing \u00a7 2.61 \"to the extent it categorically requires health care employers to deny or revoke religious exemptions from COVID - 19 vaccination mandates.\" On September 14, 2021, the Court issued a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") to that effect , Dr. A. v. Hochul , 2021 WL 4189533 (N.D.N.Y.), and ordered briefing on whether the TRO should be converted to a preliminary injunction pending a resolution of the merits of plaintiffs' constitutional claims seeking a permanent injunction. The TRO was extended for good cause to this date, October 12, 2021. Dkt. No. 15. The motion has been fully briefed and will be decided on the basis of the submissions without oral argument. II. BACKGROUND 1 On June 25, 2021, then -Governor Andrew Cuomo rescinded the COVID -19 public health emergency 1 The facts are taken from plaintiffs' verified complaint, Dkt. No. 1, which is tantamount to an affidavit, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, and from the declaration of Elizabeth Rausch -Phung, M.D., M.P.H., Dkt. No. 16. A review of these submissions did not reveal a ny genuine disputes over the essential facts necessary to decide the motion. See, e.g., In re Defend H20 v. Town Bd. of Town of E. Hampton, 147 F. Supp. 3d 80, 96 -97 (E.D.N.Y. 2015) (discussing 74adeclaration that had been in effect across New York State for the previous eighteen months. Compl. \u00b6 16; N.Y. Exec. Order 210 (June 24, 2021). As defendants explain , Cuomo's decision was based on \"declining hospitalization and [rates of COVID -19] positivity statewide, as as success vaccination rates.\" Rausch -Phung Decl., Dkt. No. 16 \u00b6 19. However, the end of the emergency declaration did not bring an end t o defendants' exercise of their emergency powers.2 Compl. \u00b6 17. On August 18, 2021, Health Commissioner Zucker issued an \"Order for Summary Action\" that required general hospitals and nursing homes to \"continuously require all covered personnel to be full y vaccinated against COVID -19.\" Ex. B to Compl. at 95 -101 (the \"August 18 Order\"). The August 18 Order included a medical exemption as well as an explicit religious exemption: Religious exemption. Covered entities shall grant a religious exemption for COV ID-19 vaccination for covered personnel if they hold a genuine and sincere religious belief contrary to the practice of immunization, subject to a reasonable accommodation by the employer. Id.; see also Compl. \u00b6 20. Just five days later, on August 23, 2021, New York State's Public Health & Health Planning Council (the \"Health Council\"), acting on a circumstances in which an evidentiary hearing on a preliminary injunction is unnecessary). 2 The New York legislature has curbed the executive's authority to issue new COVID -related orders. See N.Y. Sess. Laws ch. 71 \u00a7 4. 75asummary basis pursuant to its statutory authority under the Public Health Law, published a proposed emergency regulation that would quickly be adopted as \u00a7 2.61. 3 Id. \u00b6\u00b6 4 -5. This proposal expanded the vaccination requirement set forth in the August 18 Order to reach personnel in other healthcare settings. Rausch -Phung Decl. \u00b6 5. This proposal also eliminated the religious exemption found in Zucker's August 18 Order. See id . On August 26, 2021, three days after its publication, the Health Council adopted \u00a7 2.61, which superseded the August 18 Order and became effective immediately. Rausch -Phung Decl. \u00b6 5. According to defe ndants, the Health Council's emergency action was a necessary measure to control the continued spread of Delta and other SARS -CoV- 2 variants. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 8 -21. The seventeen plaintiffs are \"practicing doctors, M.D.s fulfilling their residency requirement, nurses, a nuclear medicine technologist, a cognitive rehabilitation therapist and a physician's liaison.\" Compl. \u00b6 36; see also id. \u00b6\u00b6 38, 47, 56, 66, 74, 84, 91, 98, 108, 117, 128, 140, 149, 161, 171, 181, 188. They are employed by hospitals, nursing homes, and other New York State entities that are subject to \u00a7 2.61. See id . \u00b6 10. Plaintiffs hold the sincere religious belief that they \"cannot consent to be inoculated . . . with vaccines that 3 August 23 is also the date on which Cuomo resigned from office, Compl. \u00b6 14, and when the Food & Drug Administration (\"FDA\") granted approval to the first COVID -19 vaccine for those age sixteen and older, Rausch -Phung Decl. \u00b6 33. Hochul has since assumed the governorship. 76awere tested, developed or produced with fetal cel l[ ] line[s] derived from procured abortions.\" Compl. \u00b6 35; see also id . \u00b6 37 (detailing beliefs held in common by plaintiffs). According to plaintiffs, the COVID -19 vaccines that are currently available violate these sincere religious beliefs \"because they all employ fetal cell lines derived from procured abortion in testing, development or production.\" Id. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 36; see also Rausch -Phung Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 35 -45 (acknowledging that fetal cell lines are widely used in pharmaceutical development and were used in the testing and production of current COVID -19 vaccines). The complaint alleges that each plaintiff has been denied a religious exemption, or had an existing religious exemption revoked, on the basis of their employers' application of \u00a7 2.61. Compl. 56, 162 -63, 173- 74, 183 -85, 189. The complaint further alleges that each plaintiff has been threatened with professional discipline, loss of licensure, admitting privileges , reputational harm, and/or the imminent termination of their employment as a result of their refusal to comply with \u00a7 2.61. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 43- 46, 52- 97, 07, 113- 124 -27, 135- 39, 144 -48, 157 -60, 164- 65, 168-70, 176 -80, 186 -87, 190 -91. III. LEGAL STANDARD \"A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.\" Winter v. Nat'l Res. Def. Council, Inc. , 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008). To win relief, the movant must ordinarily demonstrate: (1) a likelihood of irreparable harm; (2) either a likelihood of success on the merits or sufficiently serious questions as to the merits plus a balance of hardships 77athat tips decidedly in their favor; (3) that the balance of hardships tips in their favor regardless of the likelihood of success; and (4) that an injunction is in the public interest. Page v. Cuomo , 478 F. Supp. 3d 355, 362- 63 (N.D.N.Y. 2020). However, in cases like this one, where the movants seek to enjoin government action taken in the public inter est pursuant to a statutory or regulatory scheme, the less rigorous \"serious questions\" component of this legal standard is unavailable. Otoe-Missouria Tribe of Indians v. N.Y. State Dep't of Fin. Servs. , 769 F.3d 105, 110 (2d Cir. 2014). As the Second Circuit has explained, \"[t]his exception reflects the idea that governmental policies implemented through legislation or regulations developed through presumptively reasoned democratic processes are entitled to a higher degree of deference and shoul d not be enjoined lightly.\" Id. (citation omitted). Defendants' opposition memorandum invokes a second exception to the general rules governing preliminary injunctive relief. Defs.' Opp'n, Dkt. No. 16-50 at 4, 11. 4 As defendants correctly note, a heightened standard can also apply when the requested injunction (1) is \"mandatory\"; i.e. , it will alter the status quo by compelling some positive action; or (2) \"will provide the movant with substantially all of the relief sought and that relief cannot be undone even if the defendant prevails at a trial on the merits.\" Page , 478 F. Supp. 3d at 363. When either condition is met, the movant must make a \"clear\" or \"substantial\" showing of a likelihood of 4 Pagination corresponds to CM/ECF. 78asuccess on the merits, and must also make a \"strong showing\" of irreparable harm. Id. Upon review, however, it is not clear why this heightened requirement should apply to plaintiffs' request for preliminary injunctive relief. \"An injunction that enjoins a defendant from enfor cing a regulation clearly prohibits, rather than compels, government action by enjoining the future enforcement.\" Hund v. Cuomo , 501 F. Supp. 3d 185, 207 (W.D.N.Y. 2020) (cleaned up). Nor have defendants articulated how this heightened standard has been tr iggered. See generally Defs.' Opp'n. Accordingly, the ordinary rules applicable to \"prohibitory\" injunctions will be applied. See, e.g. , Hund, 501 F. Supp. 3d at 207 (rejecting application of heightened standard where plaintiff sought to enjoin application of COVID -19 Executive Order). IV. DISCUSSION 5 Since its ratification in 1791, the First Amendment has protected religious practitioners from government action that \"discriminates against some or all religious beliefs or regulates or prohibits conduct because it is undertaken for religious reasons.\" Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah , 508 U.S. 520, 532 (1993). And since Congress amended the statute in 1972, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 has explicitly required most employers to 5 Although Eleventh Amendment immunity sometimes poses a bar to \u00a7 1983 relief against state officials, the doctrine of Ex parte Young permits an official- capacity claim for prospective injunctive relief to remedy an ongoing violation of federal constitutional law. See, e.g. , Avitabile v. Beach , 277 F. (N.D.N.Y. 2017). 79areasonably accommodate an employee's religious beliefs absent evidence that doing so would pose an undue hardship. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(j). Plaintiffs contend that \u00a7 2.61 conflicts with these longstanding federal protections. In plaintiffs' view, \u00a7 2.61 \"flagrantly disallows the religious protections required by federal employment law and specifically deletes its own prior offering of religious exemptions for covered health care workers.\" Pls.' Mem., Dkt. No. 5-1 at 13. As plaintiffs explain, \u00a7 2.61 \"forbids each of their employers from even considering requests for religious exemptions notwithstanding the contrary requirements of Title VII.\" Id. at 10 (emphases omitted). According to plaintiffs, \"the specific events leading to [\u00a7 2.61's] final version show that it effectively targets religious opposition to the available COVID -19 vaccines.\" Id. at 12. A. Likelihood of Success & Irreparable Harm 6 Plaintiffs have asserted \u00a7 1983 claims under the Free Exercise Clause, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1 92-209, the 6 Defendants' threshold invocation of Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905), Zucht v. King , 260 U.S. 174 (1922), and Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158 (1944) is misplaced. Defs.' Mem. at 12- 13. The Second Circuit has previously relied on this line of precedent to reject a Free Exercise Clause challenge to vaccination requirements for schoolchildren. Phillips v. City of N.Y. , 775 F.3d 538 (2d Cir. 2015). And early in the COVID -19 pandemic a number of district courts, including this one, relied on Jacobson to reject constitutional challenges to various COVID -19 emergency restrictions. See, e.g., Page v. Cuomo , 478 F. Supp. 3d 355 (N.D.N.Y. 2020). More recently, however, the Supreme Court and the Second Circuit have both cautioned that courts should not rely on Jacobson or its progeny to grant \"special deference to the executive when the exercise of 80aSupremacy Clause, id . \u00b6\u00b6 210- 19, and the Equal Protection Clause, id. \u00b6\u00b6 220- 37. To warrant preliminary injunctive relief, plaintiffs must show a likelihood of success on the merits of at least one of these constitutional claims. See, e.g. , L.V.M. v. Lloyd , 318 F. Supp. 3d 601, 618 (S.D.N.Y. 2018). 7 As an initial matter, however, the parties dispute whether a presumption of irreparable harm should attach to these claims. Plaintiffs argue the Supreme Court has recognized that \"[t]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.\" Pls.' Mem. at 19 (quoting Elrod v. Burns , 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976) (plurality opinion)). Defendants respond that the Second Circuit has not \"consist ently presumed irreparable harm in cases involving allegations of the abridgement of First Amendment rights\" unless the injury flows from \"a rule or regulation that directly limits speech.\" Defs.' Opp'n at 25 (quoting Bronx Household of Faith v. Bd. of Educ. of City of N.Y. , 331 F.3d 342, 349 (2d Cir. 2003)). To be sure, the existing precedent in this area of law is less than perfectly clear. The question seems to arise most frequently in free speech cases, but the Second Circuit has also applied the presu mption in other constitutional contexts. N.Y. Progress & Prot. PAC v. Walsh , 733 F.3d 483, 486 (2d Cir. emergency powers infringes on constitutional rights.\" Agudath Israel of Am. v. Cuomo , 983 F.3d 620, 635 (2d Cir. 2020) 7 Because plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their Free Exercise and Supremacy Clause claims, the Court declines to reach the merits of the Equal Protection Claim. See Defs.' Mem. at 18 -19 81a2013) (identifying dispute over applicability of the presumption). In short, as the Second Circuit explained in Jolly v. Coughlin , 76 F.3d 468 (2d Cir. 1996), the favorable presumption of irreparable harm arises only after a plaintiff has shown a likelihood of success on the merits of a constitutional claim. Id. at 482 (characterizing the presumption as one that \"flows from a violation of constitutiona l rights\"). \"Thus, when a plaintiff seeks injunctive relief based on an alleged constitutional deprivation, 'the two prongs of the preliminary injunction threshold merge into one . . . in order to show irreparable injury, plaintiff must show a likelihood of success on the merits.'\" Page , 478 F. Supp. 3d at 364 (quoting v. Guiliani, 86 F. Supp. 2d 291, 295 (S.D.N.Y. 2000)). 1. The Supremacy Clause & Title VII The Supremacy Clause declares that federal law \"shall be the supreme Law of the Land . . . any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\" U.S. Const. Art. VI, cl 2. Although it \"is not the source of any federal rights and certainly does not create a cause of action,\" Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., I nc., 575 U.S. 320, 324- 25 (2015) (cleaned up), the Supreme Court has long recognized that, \"if an individual claims federal law immunizes him from state regulation, the court may issue an injunction upon finding the state regulatory actions preempted,\" id . at 326 (citing Ex parte Young , 209 U.S. 123, 155- 56 (1908)). Plaintiffs contend that \u00a7 2.61 runs afoul of the Supremacy Clause because it is preempted by Title VII, which prohibits discrimination in employment on 82athe basis of \"religion.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 200 0e-2(a)(1)- (2). Under Title VII, \"[t]he term 'religion' includes all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate [ ] an employee's . . . religious observance or practice . . . employer's business.\" \u00a7 2000e(j). This protection for religious belief means that \"[a]n employer may not take an adverse employment action against an applicant or employee because of any aspect of that individual's religious observance or practice unless the employer demonstrates that it is unable to reasonably accommodate that observance or practice without undue hardship.\" Equal Emp. Opportunity Comm'n v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., 575 U.S. 768, 776 (2015) (Alito, J., concurring). Importantly, however, \" Title VII does not demand mere neutrality with regard to religious practices . . . . [r]ather, it gives them favored treatment.\" Id. at 775 (majority opinion). Thus, under certain circumstances, Title VII \"requires otherwise- neutral policies to give way to the need for an accommodation.\" Id. Plaintiffs argue that \u00a7 2.61 conflicts 8 with Title VII's religious protections because it \"conspicuously 8 \"In general, three types of preemption exist: (1) express preemption, where Congress has expressly preempted local law; (2) field preemption, where Congress has legislated so comprehensively that federal law occupies an entire field of regulation and leaves no room for state law; and (3) conflict preempti on, where local law conflicts with federal law such that it is impossible for a party to comply with both or the local law is an obstacle to the achievement of federal objectives.\" N.Y. SMS 83aeliminates (and thereby forbids) an y opportunity for covered employees to even attempt to secure a reasonable accommodation for their sincerely held religious objections to the currently available COVID - 19 vaccines.\" Pl.'s Mem. at 7. Defendants respond that there is a distinction between a so -called \"religious exemption\" and a \"reasonable accommodation.\" Defs.' Opp'n at 15 - 16. According to defendants, \"Title VII does not entitle employees to a religious exemption \u2014 it only requires employers to make reasonable accommodation so long as it can be provided by the employer without undue hardship.\" Id. at 16. Upon review, plaintiffs have established at this early stage of the litigation that they are likely to succeed on the merits of this constitutional claim. Of course, defendants are correct th at there is a substantial difference between a blanket \"religious exemption\" from a vaccination requirement and the \"reasonable accommodation\" for religious beliefs imposed on employers by Title VII. But defendants' assertion that \u00a7 2.61 \"does not implicat e Title VII at all\" and \"does not require covered entities to deny reasonable accommodation requests\" fails to grapple with how the broad scope of the Health Council's mandate has allegedly impacted plaintiffs. The plain terms of \u00a7 2.61 do not make room for \"covered entities\" to consider requests for reasonable religious accommodations. Instead, \u00a7 2.61 obligates all covered entities to \"continuously require personnel to be fully vaccinated against COVID -19.\" And \"personnel\" is defined broadly, sweepi ng Town of Clarkstown, F.3d 97, 104 (2d Cir. 2010) (cleaned up). 84apersons employed or affiliated with a covered entity, whether paid or unpaid . . . who engage in activities such that if they were infected with COVID -19, they could potentially expose other covered personnel, patients or residents to the diseas e.\" Plaintiffs allege that some of their employers have revoked existing religious exemptions and/or religious accommodations by pointing to the State's adoption of \u00a7 2.61. See, e.g. , Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 39 -40, 77. Plaintiffs also allege that some of their employers have refused to consider exemption or accommodation requests because of \u00a7 2.61. See, e.g. , id. \u00b6 49. Although Title VII certainly does not require an employer in all cases to \"accommodate\" an employee by necessarily granting them an \"exemption,\" the statute does require employers to entertain requests for religious accommodations and to \"reasonably\" accommodate those requests absent a showing of undue hardship. According to plaintiffs, their employers have refused to engage in that process because of \u00a7 2.61. Defendants also argue that \u00a7 2.61's elimination of the religious exemption language found in the August 18 Order brings it more in line with healthcare workplace immunization requirements for measles and rubella. Although fetal cell lines were used in the development of the rubella vaccine, there is no religious exemption in the State regulations that require workers to be immunized against this pathogen. Rausch -Phung Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 44, However, this argument conflates the merits of plaintiffs' present constitutional claims with a hypothetical Title VII anti -discrimination claim for a religious accommodation. What matters here is not whether a religious practitioner would win or lose a 85afuture Title VII lawsuit. What matters is that plaintiffs' current showing establishes that \u00a7 2.61 has effectively foreclosed the pathway to seeking a religious accommodation that is guaranteed under Title VII. In any event, plaintiffs have not alleged a religious objection to other workplace vaccinatio n requirements. Nor have defendants explained why the State's approach to immunization against measles and rubella necessarily justifies an identical approach to SARS -CoV- 2. 9 In sum, plaintiffs have established that \u00a7 2.61 stands \"as an obstacle to the ac complishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\" California Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Guerra, 479 U.S. 272, 281 (1987). Accordingly, plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of this claim. 9 The State's healthcare regulatory framework is not monolithic when it comes to workplace immunization requirements. Although it may not be an explicit \"religious exemption,\" the relevant regulation for \"influenza season\" only require s covered entities to \"ensure that all personnel not vaccinated against influenza for the current influenza season wear a surgical or procedure mask while in areas where patients or residents are typically present.\" N.Y. COMP. CODES R. & REGS. tit. 10, \u00a7 2.59(d) (2014). It may be true that a hypothetical healthcare worker who sought a Title VII religious accommodation from immunization against rubella would be rebuffed by their employer on the basis of \"undue hardship.\" But the same hypothetical worker w ho objected on religious grounds to vaccination against influenza\u2014a respiratory disease broadly similar to COVID -19\u2014could be \"reasonably accommodated\" with a surgical mask. 86a 2. The First Amendment & The Free Exercise Clause The First Amendment provides that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" U.S. Const. amend. I. The \"free exercise\" component of this First Amendment guarantee ha s been incorporated against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. Cantwell v. Connecticut , 310 U.S. 296, 303 (1940). \"The free exercise of religion means, first and foremost, the right to believe and profess whatever religious doctrine one desires .\" Emp. Div., Dep't of Hum. Res. of Or. v. Smith , 494 U.S. 872, 877 (1990). Accordingly, \"religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent, or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection.\" Thomas, 450 U.S. at 714. To that end, the Free Exercise Clause \"protect[s] religious observers against unequal treatment\" and against \"laws that impose special disabilities on the basis of religious status.\" Espinoza v. Mont. Dep't of Revenue , 140 S. Ct. 2246, 2254 (2020) (citatio n omitted). However, the Free Exercise Clause \"does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes (or prescribes) conduct that his religion prescribes (or proscribes).\" Smith , 763 F.3d at 877 (citation omitted). A neutral and generally applicable law is subject to rational basis review. Agudath Israel of Am. v. Cuomo , 983 F.3d 620, 631 (2d Cir. 2020). Under that standard, the law \"is presumed to be valid and will be 87asustained if the [burden imposed] by the statute is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\" Cent. Rabbinical Cong. of U.S. & Can. v. N.Y. City Dep't of Health & Mental Hygiene, 763 F.3d 183, 186 n.2 (2d Cir. 2014) (citation omitted). \"A law burdening religious conduct that is not both neutral and generally applicable, however, is subject to strict scrutiny.\" Id. at 193. Under that standard, the government must establish that the law is \"justified by a compelling interest\" and \"narrowly tailored to advance that interest.\" Id. at 186 n.2 (citation omitted). \"Neutrality and general applicability are interrelated, and . . . failure to satisfy one requirement is a likely indication that the other has not been satisfied.\" City of Hialeah , 508 U.S. at 531. A law is not neutral if it is \"specifically directed at [a] religious practice.\" Cent. Rabbinical Cong. , 763 F.3d at 193 (citation omitted). To determine whether a law is neutral, the court begins with the text, \"for the minimum requirement of neutrality is that a law not discriminate on its face.\" City of Hialeah , 508 U.S. at 533. A law discriminates on its face \"if it refers to a religious practice without a secular meaning discernable from the language or context.\" Id. Importan tly, though, even a facially neutral law may trigger heightened scrutiny if it \"targets religious conduct for distinctive treatment.\" Id. at 534. Likewise, \"[t]he general applicability requirement prohibits the government from 'in a selective manner impos[ ing] burdens only on conduct motivated by Rabbinical Cong. , 763 F.3d at 196 (citation are selective to some extent, . . . categories of selection are of paramount concern when a law has the incidental 88aeffect of burdening religious practice.\" Id. at 197 (citation omitted). Plaintiffs contend that \u00a7 2.61 \"effectively targets religious opposition to the available COVID -19 vaccines.\" Pls.' Mem. at 12. In plaintiffs' view, the vaccination requirement \"flagrantly disallows the religious protections required by federal employment law and specifically deletes its own prior offering of religious exemptions for covered health care workers.\" Id. at 13. Defendants respond that \u00a7 2.61 is facially neutral because it \"contains no reference to religion\" and \"applies to every employee of the covered entities.\" Defs.' Opp'n at 17. According to defendants, the \"object\" of the vaccination requirement \"is to protect public health and safety by reducing the incidence of COVID -19.\" Id. at 18. Upon review, plaintiffs have established at this early stage of the litigation that \u00a7 2.61 is not a neutral law. As the Supreme Court has explained, \"the historical background of the decision under challenge, the specifi c series of events leading to the enactment or official policy in question, and the legislative or administrative history\" are all relevant circumstantial evidence in detecting a lack of neutrality. City of Hialeah , 508 U.S. at 540. Zucker's August 18 O rder, which was imposed on a summary basis, included medical and religious exemptions to COVID -19 vaccination. The Health Council's adoption of \u00a7 2.61, which was imposed on a similar summary basis just eight days later, amended the vaccination mandate to eliminate the religious exemption. This intentional change in language is the kind of \"religious gerrymander\" that triggers heightened scrutiny. 89a Plaintiffs have also established at this early stage of the litigation that \u00a7 2.61 is not generally applicable . A law is \"not generally applicable if it is substantially underinclusive such that it regulates religious conduct while failing to regulate secular conduct that is at least as harmful to the legitimate government interests purportedly justifying it.\" Cent. Rabbinical Cong. , 763 F.3d at Blackhawk Pennsylvania, 381 F.3d 202, 209 (3d Cir. 2004) (\"A law fails the general applicability requirement if it burdens a category of religiously motivated conduct but exempts or does not reach a substan tial category of conduct that is not religiously motivated and that undermines the purposes of the law to at least the same degree as the covered conduct that is religiously motivated.\"). Section 2.61's regulatory impact statement claims that \"[u]nvaccina ted personnel in [healthcare] settings have an unacceptably high risk of both acquiring COVID -19 and transmitting the virus to colleagues and/or vulnerable patients or residents, exacerbating staffing shortages, and causing unacceptably high risk of compli cations.\" Ex. A to Compl. at 78. But as plaintiffs point out, the medical exemption that remains in the current iteration of the State's vaccine mandate expressly accepts this \"unacceptable\" risk for a non -zero segment of healthcare workers. Pls.' Mem. at 13. Although defendants claim that they expect the number of people in need of a medical exemption to be low, Rausch -Phung Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 65 -66, the Supreme Court has recently emphasized that \"[c]omparability is concerned with the risks various activities pos e,\" not the reasons for which they are 90aundertaken. Tandon v. Newsom , 141 S. Ct. 1294, 1297 (2021). Thus, absent further factual development the Court cannot conclude that \u00a7 2.61 satisfies the requirement of \"general applicability.\" Finally, plaintiffs hav e established at this early stage of the litigation that \u00a7 2.61 is likely to fail strict scrutiny. To satisfy strict scrutiny, defendants must show that the challenged law advances \"interests of the highest order\" and is \"narrowly tailored\" to achieve those interests. Fulton v. City of Phila., Pa. , 141 S. Ct. 1868, 1881 (2021) (quoting City of Hialeah , 508 U.S. at 546). \"Put another way, so long as the government can achieve its interests in a manner that does not burden religion, it must do so. \" Id. Defendants have satisfied the first component of this analysis. Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo , 141 S. Ct. 63, 67 (2020) (\"Stemming the spread of COVID -19 is unquestionably a compelling interest.\"). However, they have failed to estab lish that \u00a7 2.61\u2014 and in particular, its intentional omission of a religious exemption \u2014is narrowly tailored to address that public health concern. \"Narrow tailoring requires the government to demonstrate that a policy is the 'least restrictive means' of a chieving its objective.\" Agudath Israel of Am., 983 F.3d at 633 (quoting Thomas, 450 U.S. at 718). The asserted justification \"must be genuine, not hypothesized or invented post hoc in response to litigation.\" United States v. Virginia , 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996). \"And the government must show that it 'seriously undertook to address the problem with less intrusive tools readily available to it.'\" Agudath Israel of Am. , U.S. 464, 494 (2014)). 91aDefendants have not made this showing. According to the \"alternative approaches\" component of \u00a7 2.61's regulatory impact statement, the Health Council considered two alternatives: (1) daily testing before each shift; and (2) wearing appropriately fitted N95 face masks a t all times. Ex. A to Compl. at 81; see also Defs.' Opp'n at 21. However, there is no adequate explanation from defendants about why the \"reasonable accommodation\" that must be extended to a medically exempt healthcare worker under \u00a7 2.61 could not simil arly be extended to a healthcare worker with a sincere religious objection. Fulton , 141 S. Ct. at 1881 (cautioning courts to \"scrutinize[ ] the asserted harm of granting specific exemptions to particular religious claimants\"). Nor have defendants explain ed why they chose to depart from similar healthcare vaccination mandates issued in other jurisdictions that include the kind of religious exemption that was originally present in the August 18 Order. Pl.'s Mem. at 17 (citing Illinois and California COVID -19 regulations that include religious exemption language); see also Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn , 141 S. Ct. at 67 (finding tailoring requirement unsatisfied where, inter alia, the challenged restriction was \"much tighter than those adopted by many other jurisdictions hard- hit by the pandemic\"); Mast v. Fillmore Cty., Minn. show this alternative won't work; not the [challenger's] to show it will.\"). In sum, \"[t]o meet the requirement of narrow tailoring, the government must demonstrate that 92aalternative measures imposing lesser burdens on religious liberty would fail to achieve the governm ent's interests, not simply that the chosen route was easier.\" Agudath Israel of Am. , 983 F.3d at 633 (cleaned up). Defendants have not done so. Accordingly, plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of this constitutional claim. B. The Balance of Hardships & The Public Interest Plaintiffs have also satisfied the remaining elements necessary to warrant preliminary injunctive relief. Where, as here, a governmental defendant is the party opposing relief, \"balancing of the equities merges into [the court's] consideration of the public interest.\" SAM Party of N.Y. v. Kosinski , 987 F.3d 267, 278 (2d Cir. 2021). First , the public interest lies with enforcing the guarantees enshrined in the Constitution and federal anti-discrimination law. See, e.g., Paykina ex rel. E.L. v. Lewin , 387 F. Supp. 3d 225, 245 (N.D.N.Y. 2019) (\"The public interest generally supports granting a preliminary injunction where . . . a plaintiff has established a clear likelihood of success on the merits and made a showin g of irreparable harm.\"). Second , the balance of hardships clearly favors plaintiffs. Defendants argue that a preliminary injunction will hinder its \"ongoing efforts to curb the spread\" of SARS -CoV-2. Defs.' Opp'n at 26. According to defendants, the spre ad of SARS -CoV- 2 among health care workers \"imposes staffing burdens on already strained hospital and healthcare operations due to quarantining requirements and potential 93alength of illness when healthcare workers become infected.\" Id. at 26- 27. However, defendants acknowledge that \u00a7 2.61 still includes a medical exemption that requires covered entities to make a \"reasonable accommodation.\" As plaintiffs point out, defendants have not shown that granting the same benefit to religious practitioners that was originally included in the August 18 Order \"would impose any more harm \u2014especially when Plaintiffs have been on the front lines of stopping COVID for the past 18 months while donning PPE and exercising other proper protocols in effectively slowing the spread of the disease.\" Pls.' Mem. at 20. V. CONCLUSION 10 The question presented by this case is not whether plaintiffs and other individuals are entitled to a religious exemption from the State's workplace vaccination requirement. Instead, the question is whether the State's summary imposition of \u00a7 2.61 conflicts with plaintiffs' and other individuals' federally protected right to seek a religious accommodation from their individual employers. The answer to this question is clearly yes. Plaintiffs have established that \u00a7 2.61 conflicts with longstanding federal protections for religious beliefs and that they and others will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief. Tandon, 141 S. Ct. at 1297 (finding irreparable harm from loss of free exercise rights for even minimal periods of time). 10 The bond requirement is waived. See FED. R. CIV. P. 65(c). 94aPlaintiffs have also satisfied the remaining elements necessary to obtain preliminary relief. To reiterate, these conclusions have nothing to do with how an individual employer should handle an individual employee's religious objection to a workplace vaccination requirement. But they have everything to do with the proper division of federal and state power. Cf. Arizona v. United States , 567 U.S. 387, 398 (2012) (\"Federalism, central to the const itutional design, adopts the principle that both the National and State Governments have elements of sovereignty the other is bound to respect.\"). In granting a preliminary injunction, the Court recognizes that it may not have the final word. Under 28 U.S .C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1), \"Congress permits, as an exception to the general rule, an immediate appeal from an interlocutory order that either grants or denies a preliminary injunction.\" N.Y. State Nat'l Org. for Women v. Terry , 886 F.2d 1339, 1350 (2d Cir. 1989). Because the issues in dispute are of exceptional importance to the health and the religious freedoms of our citizens, an appeal may very well be appropriate. Therefore, it is ORDERED that 1. Plaintiffs' motion to proceed pseudonymously is GRANTED11; 2. Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction is GRANTED; 11 Plaintif fs requested leave to proceed pseudonymously.

HURD United States District Judge ORDER On August 26, 2021, the New York State Department of Health ( \"DOH \") promulgated a regulation that mandates COVID -19 vaccination of health care workers. This regulation requires personnel employed at general hospitals and nursing homes to receive their first dose of a COVID -19 vaccine by September 27, 2021, and for personnel employed at 97aother covered entities to receive a vaccine by October 7, 2021. Unlike a previously applicable Public Health Order, this new regulation excludes any religious exemption. The named plaintiffs are seventeen medical professionals employed in the State of New York who allege that their sincere religious beliefs compel t hem to refuse the COVID -19 vaccines that are currently available. On September 13, 2021, plaintiffs filed this 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging this \" vaccination mandate \" violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments, the Supremacy Clause, and the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Plaintiffs sought to proceed pseudonymously. Plaintiffs also moved for a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") and a preliminary in junction that would enjoin defendants from, inter alia, enforcing the vaccine mandate \" to the extent it categorically requires health care employers to deny or revoke religious exemptions from COVID - 19 vaccination mandates. \" Upon review of plaintiffs' memorandum of law and supporting documentation, it is ORDERED that 1. Plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order is GRANTED; 2. Defendants, their officers, agents, employees, attorneys and successors in office, and all other persons in active concert or pa rticipation with them, are temporarily ENJOINED from enforcing, threatening to enforce, attempting to enforce, or otherwise requiring compliance with the vaccine mandate such that: 98aa) The vaccine mandate is suspended in operation to the extent that the DOH is barred from enforcing any requirement that employers deny religious exemptions from COVID -19 vaccination or that they revoke any exemptions employers already granted before the vaccine mandate issued; b) The DOH is barred from interfering in any way with the granting of religious exemptions from COVID -19 vaccination going forward, or with the operation of exemptions already granted; c) The DOH is barred from taking any action, disciplinary or otherwise, against the licensure, certification, residency, admitting privileges or other professional status or qualification of any of the plaintiffs on account of their seeking or having obtained a religious exemption from mandatory COVID -19 vaccination; and d) As noted supra, since the August 26, 2021 regulation d oes not require hospital and nursing home employees to receive a vaccine until September 27, 2021, the TRO does not, as a practical matter, go into effect until that date. 3. Plaintiffs shall serve defendants with (1) this Order; (2) the operative complaint a nd supporting exhibits; and (3) the motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction no later than Thursday, September 16, 2021 at 12:00 p.m.; 4. Defendants are to advise the Court if they oppose plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunc tion pending an expedited resolution of the merits of the main issue for a permanent injunction; 99a5. If yes, defendants shall file and serve all submissions in opposition to the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction before Wednesday, September 22, 20 21 at 5:00 p.m.; 6.

N.Y. COMP. CODES R. & REGS. tit. 10, \u00a7 2.61(c) (2021). As relevant here, \u00a7 2.61 eliminated a religious 101aexemption included in the first iteration of the mandate. On September 13, 2021, seventeen healthcare workers employed in New York State (\"plaintiffs\"), all of whom objec t to the existing COVID -19 vaccines on religious grounds, filed this official- capacity 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action against New York State Governor Kathy Hochul ( \"Hochul \"), New York State Health Commissioner Howard A. Zucker ( \"Zucker \"), and New York State Attorney General Letitia James ( \"James \"). Plaintiffs' three -count verified complaint alleges that\u00a7 2.61 violates their constitutional rights because it effectively forbids employers from considering workplace religious accommodations under processes guaranteed by federal law. Plaintiffs sought to enjoin defendants from, inter alia, enforcing\u00a7 2.61 \" to the extent it categorically requires health care employers to deny or revoke religious exemptions from COVID - 19 vaccination mandates. \" On September 14, 2021, the C ourt issued a temporary order restraining defendants from enforcing \u00a7 2.61 to the extent it categorically required health care employers to deny or revoke a religious exemption from COVID -19 vaccination . Dr. A. v. Hochul, 2021 WL 4189533 (N.D.N.Y) (emphasis added). After additional briefing, the temporary restraining order was converted to a preliminary injunction on October 12, 2021.1 Dr. A. v. Hochul, --F. 1 The complaint alleged that some of plaintiffs' employers had revoked existing accommodations, and that other employers had refused to consider new requests for accommodation, on the basis of the State's adoptio of\u00a7 2.61. Those factual assertions stood uncontested in the preliminary injunction record because plaintiffs' complaint 102aSupp. 3d--, 2021 WL 4734404 (N.D.N.Y.). Defendants appealed. On November 1, 2021, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ordered the preliminary injunction vacated. Dkt. No. 26. As relevant here, the panel opinion concluded that plaintiffs had failed to establish\u00a7 2.61 was not a neutral law of g eneral applicability and therefore subjected it to only rational basis review. Dkt. No. 27 at 35. Relying on Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905) and Phillips v. City of N. Y., 775 F.3d 538 (2d Cir. 2015) (per curiam), the panel held that\u00a7 2.61 \"w as a reasonable exercise of the State's power to enact rules to protect the public health. \" Dkt. No. 27 at 35. The panel opinion went on to conclude that plaintiffs had also failed to establish that \u00a7 2.61 conflicts with Title VII or federal law because it \"does not prevent employees from seeking a religious accommodation allowing them to continue working consistent with the Rule. while avoiding the vaccination requirement .\" Dkt. No. 27 at 38 (emphasis added). Therefore, plaintiffs no longer need the preliminary injunction. A certified copy of the Second Circuit's order issued on November 4, 2021. Dkt. No. 27. Therefore, it is ORDERED that was verified. However, in light of the Second Circuit's opinion, these arbitrary denials can no longer happen. 103aThe preliminary injunction entered in favor of plaintiffs on October 12, 2021 is VACATED. IT IS SO ORDERED. /s/ David N. Hurd United States District Judge Dated: November 5, 2021 Utica, New York. 104a Cite as 595 U.S. ____ (2021) GORSUCH , J., dissenting SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES No. 21A145 DR. A, ET AL ., APPLICANTS v. KATHY HOCHUL, GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK, ET AL . ON APPLICATION FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF [December 13, 2021] The application for injunctive relief presented to JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR and by her referred to the Court is denied. JUSTICE THOMAS would grant the application. JUSTICE GORSUCH , with whom J USTICE ALITO joins, dissenting from the denial of application for injunctive relief. New York recently issued a regulation requiring healthcare workers to receive a COVID -19 vaccine. Those who cite medical reasons are exempt. But no comparable exemption exists for ind ividuals whose sincere religious beliefs prevent them from taking one of the currently available vaccines. It seems New York is one of just three States to have a scheme like this. And it seems originally even New York was headed in a different direction. When it announced the mandate, the then -Governor promised a religious exemption. Weeks later, the State backtracked. It offered no scientific evidence, or even a written explanation, for the decision. But a new Governor who assumed office around the same time spoke about it. The new Governor announced that the decision to eliminate the exemption was 105a \"intentiona[l]\" and justified because no \"organized religion\" sought it and individuals who did were not \"listening to God and what God wants.\" Now, thousands o f New York healthcare workers face the loss of their jobs and eligibility for unemployment benefits. Twenty of them have filed suit arguing that the State's conduct violates the First Amendment and asking us to enjoin the enforcement of the mandate against them until this Court can decide their petition for certiorari. Respectfully, I believe they deserve that relief. I A The doctors and nurses who filed this suit and a companion case have gone to great lengths to serve their patients during the COVID -19 pandemic. Consider two of their stories. Dr. J. is an OB/GYN who works in a New York hospital. She is also a devout Cath olic. During the pandemic, she has consistently treated patients infected with COVID -19 in spite of the risks to herself. Sometimes, in emergencies, she has had to rush into a delivery room without knowing whether a delivering mother is infected with the d isease. Dr. J. has done all this even while pregnant herself. Dr. F. serves a rural town as an oral surgeon. Like Dr. J., he is Catholic and has never turned away a patient infected with COVID -19. Instead, he has faced open wounds and mouths even when it involved risks to his own health. Dr. F. says he has done so because, if he had refused, many of his patients seeking care could not have obtained it elsewhere. 106a These applicants are not \"'anti -vaxxers'\" who object to all vaccines. Complaint in No. 21 -CV-0 1009 (NDNY), \u00b6 37(g). Instead, the applicants explain, they cannot receive a COVID -19 vaccine because their religion teaches them to oppose abortion in any form, and because each of the currently available vaccines has depended upon abortion -derived fetal cell lines in its production or testing. The applicants acknowledge that many other religious believers feel differently about these matters than they do. But no one questions the sincerity of their religious beliefs. B Until very recently, none of this p osed a difficulty. The pandemic began approximately 21 months ago. Vaccines became available to New York healthcare workers roughly 12 months ago. Through it all, the State allowed \u2014and depended on \u2014front -line healthcare workers like the applicants to serve their patients. Things only began to change four months ago when New York, for the first time, announced that it was contemplating a vaccine mandate. Even then, it did not seem the State's plans would pose a problem for the applicants or thousands of other s like them. Governor Andrew Cuomo assured the public that any new mandate would contain \"exceptions for those with religious or medical reasons.\" Governor Cuomo Announces COVID - 19 Vaccination Mandate for Healthcare Workers (Aug. 16, 2021), https://www.go vernor.ny.gov/news/governor- cuomoannounces 18, 2021, health commissioner Howard Zucker issued the proposed mandate, indicating that it would take effect on September 27. Just as the Governor promis ed, it 107a contained a religious exemption. App. to Application Exh. 8, pp. 103 -104. The trouble here began only when Mr. Cuomo left the Governor's office and Kathy Hochul assumed it. On August 23, one day before Governor Hochul took office, the State's Publi c Health and Health Planning Council \u2014an advisory committee headed by Commissioner Zucker \u2014proposed a revised mandate, this time with no religious exemption. The council issued the proposed regulation three days later. 10 N. Y. Admin. Code \u00a72.61 (2021). The regulatory impact statement accompanying this decision did not discuss the feasibility of a religious exemption or the reasons for removing it. But the new Governor did. In response to a reporter's question 12 days before the revised mandate was set to ta ke effect on September 27, Governor Hochul acknowledged that \"we left off [the religious exemption] in our regulations intentionally.\" Governor Hochul Holds Following -19 why, the Governor answered that there is no \"sanctioned religious exemption from any organized religion\" and that organized religions are \"encouraging the opposite.\" Ibid. Apparently contem plating Catholics who object to receiving a vaccine, Governor Hochul added that \"everybody from the Pope on down is encouraging people to get vaccinated.\" Ibid. Speaking to a different audience, the Governor elaborated: \"How can you believe that God would give a vaccine that would cause you harm? That is not 108a truth. Those are just lies out there on social media.\" Governor Hochul Attends Services at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem (Sept. 12, 2021), https://governor.ny.gov/news/video -church . The day before the mandate went into effect, Governor Hochul again expressed her view that religious objections to COVID -19 vaccines are theologically flawed: \"All of you, yes, I know you're vaccinated, you're the smart ones, but you know there's people out there who aren't listening to God and what God wants. You know who they are.\" Governor Hochul Attends Service at Christian Cultural Center (Sept. 26, 2021), https://governor.ny.gov/news/ru shtranscript - governor - hochul - attends - service - christiancultural -center. Around the same time, Governor Hochul also announced that New York would alter its unemployment insurance scheme. Healthcare workers who failed to comply with the mandate woul d not only lose their jobs; they would be per se ineligible for unemployment insurance benefits. See In Preparation for Monday Vaccination Deadline, Governor Hochul Releases Comprehensive Plan to Address Preventable Health Care Staffing Shortage (Sept. State's website explains, unemployment insurance cases are generally \"reviewed on a case- by-case basis,\" but healthcare workers who refuse a vaccine are 109a \"ineligible.\" N. Y. State Dept. of Labor, Unemployment Insurance Top Frequently Asked Questions (Sept. 25, 2021), https://dol.ny.gov/unemployment -insurance - topfrequently- asked -questions. C Facing the imminent loss of their jobs and unemployment benefits, the doctors and nurses before us filed two separate lawsuits seeking a preliminary injunction preventing New York from enforcing its new mandate against them. In the first suit, District Judge David Hurd granted the requested relief after concluding that New York's \"intentional change in language is the kind of religious gerrymander\" that violates the First Amendment. Dr. A. v. 2021 WL 4734404, *8 (NDNY, Oct. 12, 2021) (internal quotation marks omitted). In the second suit, the District Court reached a contrary conclusion and denied relief without an opinion. We The Patriots USA, Inc. v. Hochul , No. 21 -cv- 4954 (EDNY, Sept. 12, 2021), App. to Application for Injunctive Relief in No. 21A125, p. 6. Ultimately, the Second Circuit issued a combined judgment rejecting all of the applicants' claims and dissolving the preliminary injunction issued in Dr. A . See We The Patriots USA, Inc. v. Hochul , 17 F. 4th 368 (CA2 2021) ( per ). II We assess requests for temporar y injunctive relief under a familiar standard that focuses, among other things, on the merits of the applicants' underlying claims and the harms they are likely to suffer. Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo , 592 110a U.S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 2). In this case, no one seriously disputes that, absent relief, the applicants will suffer an irreparable injury. Not only does New York threaten to have them fired and strip them of unemployment benefits. This Court has held that \"[t]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.\" Elrod v. Burns , 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976). Accordingly, before us the parties' fight focuses dominantly on whether the applicants are likely to succeed on the merits of their First Amendment claim. The answer to that question is clear. The Free Exercise Clause protects not only the right to hold unpopular religious beliefs inwardly and secretly. It protects the right to live out those beliefs publicly in \"the performance of (or abstention from) physical acts.\" Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith , 494 U.S. 872, 877 (1990). Under this Court's precedents, laws targeting acts for disfavor only when they are religious in nature or because of their religious character are \"doubtless . . . unconstitutional.\" Id., at 877 -878. As a result, where \"official expressions of hostility to religion\" accompany laws or policies burdening free exercise, we have simply \"set aside\" such policies without further inquiry. Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Comm'n , 584 U.S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 18). But even where such overt animus is lacking, laws that impose burdens on religious exercises must still be both neutral toward religion and generally applicable or survive strict scrutiny. Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508 U.S. 520, 546 (1993). To meet its burden under strict scrutiny, the government must 111a demonstrate that its law is narrowly ta ilored to serve a compelling state interest. Id. , at 531- 532. Applying these principles to this case, New York's mandate falters at each step. A Under the Free Exercise Clause, government \"cannot act in a manner that passes judgment upon or presupposes th e illegitimacy of religious beliefs and practices.\" Masterpiece, 584 U.S., at ___ -___ (slip op., at 17 -18); see also Smith , 494 U.S. , at 877- 878. As a result, we have said that government actions burdening religious practice should be \"set aside\" if there is even \"slight suspicion\" that those actions \"stem from animosity to religion or distrust of its practices.\" Masterpiece, 584 U.S., at ___ -___ (slip op., at 17 -18). New York's mandate is such an action. The State began with a plan to exempt religious obj ectors from its vaccine mandate and only later changed course. Its regulatory impact statement offered no explanation for the about -face. At the same time, a new Governor whose assumption of office coincided with the change in policy admitted that the revi sed mandate \"left off \" a religious exemption \"intentionally.\" The Governor offered an extraordinary explanation for the change too. She said that \"God wants\" people to be vaccinated \u2014and that those who disagree are not listening to \"organized religion\" or \"everybody from the Pope on down.\" Then the new Governor went on to announce changes to the State's unemployment scheme designed to single out for special disfavor healthcare workers who failed to comply with the revised mandate. This record gives rise to more than a \"slight 112a suspicion\" that New York acted out of \"animosity [toward] or distrust of \" unorthodox religious beliefs and practices. Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 17). This record practically exudes suspicion of those who hold unpopular religious beliefs . That alone is sufficient to render the mandate unconstitutional as applied to these applicants. B New York's regulation fares no better if the question is the law's neutrality and general applicability. Begin with neutrality. Even absent proof of animus, adissenting law will not qualify as neutral if a religious exercise is the \"object\" of a law and not just \"incidental[ly]\" or unintentionally affected by it. Smith , 494 U.S., at 878. At \"minimum,\" that me ans a law must not \"discriminate on its face.\" Lukumi , 508 U.S., at 533. Apart from that, it also means that a law will not qualify as neutral if it is \"specifically directed at . . . religious see also Lukumi , 508 U.S., at 535. For reasons we have already seen, New York's mandate fails this test too. Rather than burden a religious exercise incidentally or unintentionally, by the Governor's own admission the State \"intentionally\" targeted for disfavor those whose religiou s beliefs fail to accord with the teachings of \"any organized religion\" and \"everybody from the Pope on down.\" Even if one were to read the State's actions as something other than signs of animus, they leave little doubt that the revised mandate was specifically directed at the applicants' unorthodox religious beliefs and practices. 113a Consider general applicability next. Recently, a majority of this Court reiterated that a law loses its claim to general applicability when it \"prohibits religious conduct while permitting secular conduct that undermines the government's asserted interests in a similar way.\" Fulton v. Philadelphia , 593 U.S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 6). That is exactly what New York's regulation does: It prohibits exemptions for religious reasons while permitting exemptions for medical reasons. And, as the applicants point out, allowing a healthcare worker to remain unvaccinated undermines the State's asserted public health goals equally whether that worker happens to remain unvaccinated for religious reasons or medical ones. See Does v. Mills , 595 U.S. ___ (2021) ( G ORSUCH , J., dissenting from denial of application for injunctive relief ). To be sure, the State speculates that a religious exemption could undermine the purpose of its vaccine mandate differently from a medical exemption if more people were to seek a religious exemption than a medical exemption. But this Court's gen eral applicability test doesn't turn on that kind of numbers game. At this point in the proceedings, the only question is whether the challenged law contains an exemption for a secular objector that \"undermines the government's asserted interests in a simi lar way\" an exemption for a religious objector might. Fulton , 593 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 6). Laws operate on individuals; rights belong to individuals. And the relevant question here involves a oneto-one comparison between the individual seeking a religious exemption and one benefiting from a secular exemption. See, e.g., Tandon v. Newsom , 593 U.S. ___, ___ (2021) ( per curiam ) (slip op., at 1) (comparing 114a the relevant secular exemptions to \"the religious exercise at issue\"). If the estimated number of those who might seek different exemptions is relevant, it comes only later in the proceedings when we turn to the application of strict scrutiny. See Holt v. Hobbs , 574 U.S. 352, 368 (2015) (considering sizes of different groups seeking exemptions). At that stage, a State might argue, for example, that it has a compelling interest in achieving herd immunity against certain diseases in a population. It might further contend the most narrowly tailored means to achieve that interest is to restrict vaccine exemptions to a particular number divided in a nondiscriminatory manner between medical and religious objectors. With sufficient evidence to support claims like these, the State might prevail. See infra , at 10- 11. But none of that bears on the preliminary quest ion whether such a mandate is generally applicable or whether it treats a religious person less favorably than a secular counterpart. C Failing either the neutrality or general applicability test is enough to trigger strict scrutiny and impose on New York the burden of showing that its law serves a compelling interest and employs the least restrictive means of doing so. Lukumi , 508 U.S. , at 531. And even accepting for present purposes that the State can meet the first of these burdens, it cannot satisfy th e second. Cf. Mills , 595 U.S., at ___- ___ (opinion of G ORSUCH , J.) (slip op., at 6 -8). Maybe the most telling evidence that New York's policy isn't narrowly tailored lies in how unique it is. It seems that nearly every other State has found that 115a it can sa tisfy its COVID -19 public health goals without coercing religious objectors to accept a vaccine. See Addendum to Application for Injunctive Relief. Nor has New York \"offer[ed] persuasive reasons\" why it, almost uniquely, cannot do the same. Holt, 574 U.S. , at 369. To the contrary, as we have seen, what explanations the Governor has chosen to supply undermine rather than advance the State's case. Though this alone is sufficient to show that New York's law is not narrowly tailored, still more proof exists. I n a similar case, Maine recently argued that it needed a 90% vaccination rate among workers in each of its healthcare facilities to protect against an undue number of COVID -19 breakout cases. Mills , 595 U.S., at ___ (opinion of G ORSUCH , J.) (slip op., at 7). By contrast, in the case before us, New York has not even attempted to identify what percentage of vaccinated workers it thinks is necessary to protect public health. And even assuming New York could prove it needed to achieve a similar vaccination rate, the evidence before us shows that employee vaccination rates in the State's healthcare facilities already stand at between roughly 90% and 96%. Brief in Opposition to Application for Injunctive Relief 14. Putting a finer point on it: New York has present ed nothing to suggest that accommodating the religious objectors before us would make a meaningful difference to the protection of public health. The State has not even tried. Before leaving the subject, one further point bears mention. As I alluded to earlier, if a State could prove that granting or denying religious exemptions would make the difference between achieving a crucial 116a vaccination threshold, it may be that denying exemptions beyond that threshold number could qualify as a narrowly tailored rule necessary to achieve a compelling state interest. Again, though, the problem is that New York does not even seek to advance an argument along these or any similar lines. III Today, we do not just fail the applicants. We fail ourselves. It is among our Nation's proudest boasts that, \"[i]f there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or p etty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in [matters of] religion.\" West Virginia State Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette , 319 U.S. 624, 642 (1943). In this country, \"religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent, or comprehensible to others in order to merit . . . protection.\" Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Employment Security Div. , 450 U.S. 707, 714 (1981). Nor is the free exercise of religion \"limited to beliefs which are shared by all of the members of a religious sect.\" Id., at 715 -716. Millions h ave fled to this country to escape persecution for their unpopular or unorthodox religious beliefs, attracted by America's promise that \"[e]very citizen here is in his own country. To the protestant it is a protestant country; to the catholic, a catholic country; and the jew, if he pleases, may establish in it his New Jerusalem.\" People v. Phillips , 1 W. L. J. 109, 112 -113 (Gen. Sess., N. Y. 1813), reported in W. Sampson, The Catholic Question in America 85 (1813). As today's case shows, however, sometimes our promises outrun our actions. Sometimes dissenting religious beliefs can seem strange and bewildering. In 117a times of crisis, this puzzlement can evolve into fear and anger. It seems Governor Hochul's thinking has followed this trajectory, and I suspect s he is far from alone. After all, today a large majority of Americans \u2014religious persons included\u2014have taken one of the COVID -19 vaccines. It is also true that some faith leaders, the Pope included, have encouraged vaccination. If so many other religious persons are willing to be vaccinated, it is tempting enough to ask: What can be so wrong with coercing the few who are not? By now, though, we should know the costs that come when this Court stands silent as majorities invade the constitutional rights of the unpopular and unorthodox. More than 80 years ago, in the shadow of a looming second world war, local governments across the country rushed to encourage displays of national unity. A public school in Minersville, Pennsylvania, did its part by requiring all students to stand daily and salute the American flag. But Lillian and William Gobitas would not oblige. As Jehovah's Witnesses, they believed they could not pledge fealty to anything or anyone except God. When the children refused to salute, the school expelled them. See S. Peters, Judging Jehovah's Witnesses: Religious Persecution and the Dawn of the Rights Revolution 19-38 (2000) (Peters). When the Gobitas family sought this Court's intervention, it demurred. The Court ruled that the Constitution does not \"compel exemption from doing what society thinks necessary for the promotion of some great common end.\" Minersville School Dist. v. Gobitis , 310 U.S. 586, 593 (1940). In doing so, the Court not only erred in the small matter of the 118achildren's last name; it erred in the most fundamental of things. It took the view that the collective was more important than the individual \u2014 and that the demands of an impending emergency were more pressing than holding fast to the timeless promises of our Constitution. Id. , at 596. In the weeks that followed the decision, Witnesses across the country suffered hundreds of physical attacks. Peters 72 -95. Eventually, the Court changed course and overruled Gobitis. In West Virginia State Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, the Court finally acknowledged what had been true all along \u2014that our Constitution is intended to prevail over the passions of the moment, and that the unalienable rights recorded in its text are not matters to \"be submitted to vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections.\" 319 U.S., at 638. Instead, it is this Court's duty to \"apply the limitations of the Constitution with no fear that freedom to be intellectually and spiritually diverse or even contrary will disintegrate the social organization.\" Id., at 641. The First Amendment protects against \"coercive elimination of dissent\" and \"was designed to avoid these ends by avoiding these beginnings.\" Ibid. Today, our Nation faces not a world war but a pandemic. Like wars, though, pandemics often produce demanding new socia l rules aimed at protecting collective interests \u2014 and with those rules can come fear and anger at individuals unable to conform for religious reasons. If cases like Gobitis bear any good, it is in their cautionary tale. They remind us that, in the end, it is always the failure to defend the Constitution's promises that leads to this 119a Court's greatest regrets. They remind us, too, that in America, freedom to differ is not supposed to be \"limited to things that do not matter much. That would be a mere shadow of freedom. The test of its substance is the right to differ as to things that touch the heart of the existing order.\" Barnette , 319 U.S., at 642. The test of this Court's substance lies in its willingness to defend more than the shadow of freedom in the tr ying times, not just the easy ones. We have already lived through the Gobitis - Barnette cycle once in this pandemic. At first, this Court permitted States to shutter houses of worship while allowing casinos, movie theaters, and other favored businesses to remain open. Falling prey once more to the \"judicial impulse to stay out of the way in times of crisis,\" the Court allowed States to do all this even when religious institutions agreed to follow the same occupancy limits and protective measures considered safe enough for comparable gatherings in secular spaces. Roman Catholic Diocese, 592 U.S., at ___ ( G ORSUCH , J., concurring) (slip op., at 5). But as days gave way to weeks and weeks to months, this Court came to recognize that the Constitution is not to be put away in challenging times, and we stopped tolerating discrimination against religious exercises. Tand on, 593 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 1). Finally, churches and synagogues and mosques reopened on equal footing with secular institutions. Still, it seems the old lessons are hard ones. Six weeks ago, this Court refused relief in a case involving Maine's he althcare workers. Mills , 595 U.S. ___. Today, the Court repeats the mistake by turning away New York's doctors and nurses. We do all this even though the State's executive decree clearly 120ainterferes with the free exercise of religion \u2014and does so seemingly b ased on nothing more than fear and anger at those who harbor unpopular religious beliefs. We allow the State to insist on the dismissal of thousands of medical workers \u2014the very same individuals New York has depended on and praised for their service on the pandemic's front lines over the last 21 months. To add insult to injury, we allow the State to deny these individuals unemployment benefits too. One can only hope today's ruling will not be the final chapter in this grim story. Cases like this one may serve as cautionary tales for those who follow. But how many more reminders do we need that \"the Constitution is not to be obeyed or disobeyed as the circumstances of a particular crisis . . . may suggest\"? Downes v.

REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT Statutory Authority: The authority for the pr omulgation of these regulations is contained in Public Health Law (PHL) Sections 225(5), 2800, 2803(2), 3612 and 4010 (4). PHL 225(5) authorizes the Public Health and Health Planning Council (PHHPC) to issue 139a regulations in the State Sanitary Code pertaini ng to any matters affecting the security of life or health or the preservation and improvement of public health in the state of New York, including designation and control of communicable diseases and ensuring infection control at healthcare facilities and any other premises. PHL Article 28 (Hospitals), Section 2800 specifies that \"hospital and related services including health - related service of the highest quality, efficiently provided and properly utilized at a reasonable cost, are of vital concern to t he public health. In order to provide for the protection and promotion of the health of the inhabitants of the state, pursuant to section three of article seventeen of the constitution, the department of health shall have the central, comprehensive respon sibility for the development and administration of the state's policy with respect to hospital and related services, and all public and private institutions, whether state, county, municipal, incorporated or not incorporated, serving principally as facilit ies for the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of human disease, pain, injury, deformity or physical condition or for the rendering of health -related service shall be subject to the provisions of this article.\" PHL Section 2803(2) authorizes PHHPC to ad opt and amend rules and regulations, subject to the approval of the Commissioner, to implement the purposes and provisions of PHL Article 28, and to establish minimum standards governing the operation of health care facilities. PHL Section 3612 authoriz es PHHPC to adopt and amend rules and regulations, subject to the approval of the Commissioner, with respect to certified home 140a health agencies, long term home health care programs, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) home care programs, licensed hom e care service agencies, and limited licensed home care service agencies. PHL Section 4010 (4) authorizes PHHPC to adopt and amend rules and regulations, subject to the approval of the Commissioner, with respect to hospice organizations. Social Service Law (SSL) Section 461 requires the Department to promulgate regulations establishing general standards applicable to Adult Care Facilities (ACF). SSL Section 461 -e authorizes the Department to promulgate regulations to require adult care facilities to maintain certain records with respect to the facilities residents and the operation of the facility. Legislative Objectives: The legislative objective of PHL Section 225 empowers PHHPC to address any issue affecting the security of life or health or the preservation and improvement of public health in the state of New York, including designation and control of communicable diseases and ensuring infection control at healthcare facilities and any other premises. PHL Article 28 specifically addresses the prot ection of the health of the residents of the State by assuring the efficient provision and proper utilization of health services of the highest quality at a reasonable cost. PHL Article 36 addresses the services rendered by certified home health agencies, long term home health care programs, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) home care programs, licensed home care service agencies, and limited licensed home care service agencies. PHL Article 40 declares that hospice is a socially and financially beneficial alternative to 141a conventional curative care for the terminally ill. Lastly, the legislative objective of SSL Section 461 is to promote the health and well -being of residents of ACFs. Needs and Benefits: The Centers for Disease Control and Preventi on (CDC) has identified a concerning national trend of increasing circulation of the SARS -CoV- 2 Delta variant. Since early July, cases have risen 10 -fold, and 95 percent of the sequenced recent positives in New York State were the Delta variant. Recent New York State data show that unvaccinated individuals are approximately 5 times as likely to be diagnosed with COVID -19 compared to vaccinated individuals. Those who are unvaccinated have over 11 times the risk of being hospitalized with COVID -19. The C OVID -19 vaccines are safe and effective. They offer the benefit of helping to reduce the number of COVID -19 infections, including the Delta variant, which is a critical component to protecting public health. Certain settings, such as healthcare facilitie s and congregate care settings, pose increased challenges and urgency for controlling the spread of this disease because of the vulnerable patient and resident populations that they serve. Unvaccinated personnel in such settings have an unacceptably high risk of both acquiring COVID -19 and transmitting the virus to colleagues and/or vulnerable patients or residents, exacerbating staffing shortages, and causing unacceptably high risk of complications. In response to this significant public health threat, through this emergency regulation, the Department is requiring covered entities to ensure their personnel 142a are fully vaccinated against COVID -19, and to document evidence thereof in appropriate records. Covered entities are also required to review and make determinations on medical exemption requests, and provide reasonable accommodations therefor to protect the wellbeing of the patients, residents and personnel in such facilities. Documentation and information regarding personnel vaccinations as well as exemption requests granted are required to be provided to the Department immediately upon request. Costs for the Implementation of and Continuing Compliance with these Regulations to the Regulated En tity: Covered entities must ensure that personnel are fully vaccinated against COVID -19 and document such vaccination in personnel or other appropriate records. Covered entities must also review and make determinations on requests for medical exemption s, which must also be documented in personnel or other appropriate records, as well as any reasonable accommodations. This is a modest investment to protect the health and safety of patients, residents, and personnel, especially when compared to both the direct medical costs and indirect costs of personnel absenteeism. Cost to State and Local Government: The State operates several healthcare facilities subject to this regulation. Most county health departments are licensed under Article 28 or Article 36 of the PHL and are therefore also subject to regulation. Similarly, certain counties and the City of New York operate facilities licensed under Article 28. 143a These State and local public facilities would be required to ensure that personnel are fully vac cinated against COVID -19 and document such vaccination in personnel or other appropriate records. They must also review and make determinations on requests for medical exemptions, which must also be documented in personnel or other appropriate records, al ong with any reasonable accommodations. Although the costs to the State or local governments cannot be determined with precision, the Department does not expect these costs to be significant. State facilities should already be ensuring COVID -19 vaccinati on among their personnel, subject to State directives. Further, these entities are expected to realize savings as a result of the reduction in COVID -19 in personnel and the attendant loss of productivity and available staff. Cost to the Department of Hea lth: There are no additional costs to the State or local government, except as noted above. Existing staff will be utilized to conduct surveillance of regulated parties and to monitor compliance with these provisions. Local Government Mandates: Cover ed entities operated by local governments will be subject to the same requirements as any other covered entity subject to this regulation. Paperwork: This measure will require covered entities to ensure that personnel are fully vaccinated against COVID -19 and document such vaccination in personnel or other appropriate records. Covered entities must also review and make determinations on 144a requests for me dical exemptions, which must also be documented in personnel or other appropriate records along with any reasonable accommodations. Upon the request of the Department, covered entities must report the number and percentage of total covered personnel, as well as the number and percentage that have been vaccinated against COVID -19 and those who have been granted a medical exemption, along with any reasonable accommodations. Facilities and agencies must develop and implement a policy and procedure to ensure c ompliance with the provisions of this section, making such documents available to the Department upon request. Duplication: This regulation will not conflict with any state or federal rules. Alternative Approaches: One alternative would be to require covered entities to test all personnel in their facility before each shift worked. This approach is limited in its effect because testing only provides a person's status at the time of the test and testing every person in a healthcare facility every day is impractical and would place an unreasonable resource and financial burden on covered entities if PCR tests couldn't be rapidly turned around before the commencement of the shift. Antigen tests have not proven as reliable for asymptomatic diagnosis to da te. Another alternative to requiring covered entities to mandate vaccination would be to require covered entities to mandate all personnel to wear a fit -tested N95 face covering at all times when in the facility, in order to prevent transmission of the virus. However, 145a acceptable face coverings, which are not fit -tested N95 face coverings have been a long -standing requirement in these covered entities, and, while helpful to reduce transmission it does not prevent transmission and; therefore, masking in add ition to vaccination will help reduce the numbers of infections in these settings even further. Federal Requirements: There are no minimum standards established by the federal government for the same or similar subject areas. Compliance Schedule: These emergency regulations will become effective upon filing with the Department of State and will expire, unless renewed, 90 days from the date of filing. As the COVID -19 pandemic is consistently and rapidly changing, it is not possible to determine the expected duration of need at this point in time. The Department will continuously evaluate the expected duration of these emergency regulations throughout the aforementioned 90 -day effective period in making determinations on the need for continuing this regulation on an emergency basis or issuing a notice of proposed rule making for permanent adoption. This notice does not constitute a notice of proposed or revised rule making for permanent adoption. Contact Person: Ms. Kat herine E. Ceroalo NYS Department of Health Bureau of Program Counsel, Regulatory Affairs Unit Corning Tower Building, Room 2438 Empire State Plaza Albany, ANALYSIS Effect on Small Business and Local Government: This regulation will not impact local governments or small businesses unless they operate a covered entity as defined in the emergency regulation. Currently, 5 general hospitals, 79 nursing homes, 75 certified home health agencies (CHHAs), 20 hospices and 1,055 licensed home care service agencies (LHCSAs), and 483 adult care facilities (ACFs) are small businesses (defined as 100 employees or less), independently owned and operated affected by this rule. Local governments operate 19 hospitals, 137 diagnostic and treatment facilities, 21 nursing homes, 12 CHHAs, at least 48 LHCSAs, 1 hospice, and 2 ACFs. Compliance Requirements: Covered entities are required to ensure their personnel are fully vaccinated against COVID -19, and to document evidence thereof i n appropriate records. Covered entities are also required to review and make determinations on medical exemption requests, along with any reasonable accommodations. Upon the request of the Department, covered entities must report the number and percent age of total covered personnel, as well as the number and percentage that have been vaccinated against COVID - 19 and those who have been granted a medical exemption, along with any reasonable accommodations. Facilities and agencies must 147a develop and implement a policy and procedure to ensure compliance with the provisions of this section, making such documents available to the Department upon request. Professional Services: There are no additional professional services required as a result of this regulation. Compliance Costs: Covered entities must ensure that personnel are fully vaccinated against COVID -19 and document such vaccination in personnel or other appropriat e records. Covered entities must also review and make determinations on requests for medical exemptions, which must also be documented in personnel or other appropriate records, along with any reasonable accommodations. This is a modest investment to protect the health and safety of patients, residents, and personnel, especially when compared to both the direct medical costs and indirect costs of personnel absenteeism. Economic and Technological Feasibility: There are no economic or technological impedi ments to the rule changes. Minimizing Adverse Impact: As part of ongoing efforts to address the COVID -19 pandemic, regulated parties have been a partner in implementing measures to limit the spread and/or mitigate the impact of COVID -19 within the Depart ment since March of 2020. Further, the Department currently has an emergency regulation in place, which requires nursing homes and adult care facilities to offer COVID -19 vaccination to personnel 148a and residents, which has helped to facilitated vaccination of personnel. Further, it is the Department's understanding that many facilities across the State have begun to impose mandatory vaccination policies. Lastly, on August 18, 2021, President Biden announced that as a condition of participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the United States Department of Health and Human Services will be developing regulations requiring nursing homes to mandate COVID -19 vaccination for workers. Small Business and Local Government Participation: Due to the emergent nature of COVID -19, small businesses and local governments were not consulted. If these regulations are proposed for permanent adoption, all parties will have an opportunity to provide comments during the notice and comment period. RURAL AREA FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS Type and Estimated Numbers of Rural Areas: While this rule applies uniformly throughout the state, including rural areas, for the purposes of this Rural Area Flexibility Analysis (RAFA), \"rural area\" means areas of the areas are defined as \"counties within the state having less than two hundred thousand population, and the municipalities, individuals, institutions, communities, and programs and such other e ntities or resources found therein. In counties of two hundred thousand or 149a greater population 'rural areas' means towns with population densities of one hundred fifty persons or less per square mile, and the villages, individuals, institutions, communitie s, programs and such other entities or resources as are found therein.\" The following 42 counties have an estimated population of less than 200,000 based upon 2019 United States Census projections: Allegany County Broome County Cattaraugus County Cayuga County Chautauqua Chemung County Chenango County Clinton County Columbia County Cortland County Delaware County Essex County Franklin County Fulton County Genesee County Greene County Hamilton County Herkimer County Jefferson County Lewis County Livingston County Madison County Montgomery County Ontario County Orleans County Oswego County Otsego County Putnam County Rensselaer County Schenectady County Schoharie County Schuyler County Seneca County St. Lawrence County Steuben County Sullivan County Tioga County Tompkins County Ulster County Warren County Washington County Wayne County Wyoming County Yates County The following counties of have population of 200,000 or greater, and towns with population 150a densities of 150 person or fewer per square mile, based upon 2019 United States Census population projections: Albany County Dutchess County Erie County Monroe Co unty Niagara County Oneida County Onondaga County Orange County Saratoga County Suffolk County Reporting, recordkeeping, and other compliance requirements; and professional services: Covered entities are required to ensure their personnel are fully vaccinated against COVID -19, and to document evidence thereof in appropriate records. Covered entities are also required to review and make determinations on medical exemption requests, along with any reasonable accommodations. Upon the request of the Department, covered entities must report the number and percentage of total covered personnel, as wel l as the number and percentage that have been vaccinated against COVID - 19 and those who have been granted a medical exemption, along with any reasonable accommodations. Facilities and agencies must develop and implement a policy and procedure to ensure co mpliance with the provisions of this section, making such documents available to the Department upon request. 151a Compliance Costs: Covered entities must ensure that personnel are fully vaccinated against COVID -19 and document such vaccination in personnel or other appropriate records. Covered entities must also review and make determinations on requests for medical exemptions, which must also be documented in personnel or other appropriate records, along with any reasonable accommodations. This is a modes t investment to protect the health and safety of patients, residents, and personnel, especially when compared to both the direct medical costs and indirect costs of personnel absenteeism. Minimizing Adverse Impact: As part of ongoing efforts to address the COVID -19 pandemic, regulated parties have been a partner in implementing measures to limit the spread and/or mitigate the impact of COVID -19 within the Department since March of 2020. Further, the Department curre ntly has an emergency regulation in place, which requires nursing homes and adult care facilities to offer COVID -19 vaccination to personnel and residents, which has helped to facilitated vaccination of personnel. Further, it is the Department's understan ding that many facilities across the State have begun to impose mandatory vaccination policies. Lastly, on August 18, 2021, President Biden announced that as a condition of participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the United States Department of Health and Human Services will be developing regulations requiring 152a nursing homes to mandate COVID -19 vaccination for workers. Rural Area Participation: Due to the emergent nature of COVID -19, parties representing rural areas were not consulted. If these regulations are proposed for permanent adoption, all parties will have an opportunity to provide comments during the notice and comment period. JOB IMPAC T STATEMENT Nature of Impact: Covered entities may terminate personnel who are not fully vaccinated and do not have a valid medical exemption and are unable to otherwise ensure individuals are not engaged in patient/resident care or expose other covered personnel. Categories and numbers affected: This rule may impact any individual who falls within the definition of \"personnel\" who is not fully vaccinated against COVID -19 and does not have a valid medical exemption on file with the covered entity for which they work or are affiliated. Regions of adverse impact: The rule would apply uniformly throughout the State and the Department does not anticipate that there will be any regions of the state where the rule would have a disproportionate adverse impact on jobs or employment. Minimizing adverse impact: As part of ongoing efforts to address the COVID -19 pandemic, regulated parties have been a partner in 153a implementing measures to limit the spread and/or mitigate the impact of COVID -19 within the Department since March of 2020. Further, the Department curre ntly has an emergency regulation in place, which requires nursing homes and adult care facilities to offer COVID -19 vaccination to personnel and residents, which has helped to facilitated vaccination of personnel. Further, it is the Department's understan ding that many facilities across the State have begun to impose mandatory vaccination policies. Lastly, on August 18, 2021, President Biden announced that as a condition of participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the United States Department of Health and Human Services will be developing regulations requiring nursing homes to mandate COVID -19 vaccination for workers. EMERGENCY JUSTIFICATION The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified a concerning national trend of increasing circulation of the SARS -CoV- 2 Delta variant. Since early July, cases have risen 10- fold, and 95 percent of the sequenced recent positives in New York State were the Delta variant. Recent New York State data show that unvaccinated individuals are a pproximately 5 times as likely to be diagnosed with COVID -19 compared to vaccinated individuals. Those who are unvaccinated have over 11 times the risk of being hospitalized with COVID -19. The COVID -19 vaccines are safe and effective. They offer the benefit of helping to reduce the number 154a of COVID -19 infections, including the Delta variant, which is a critical component to protecting public health. Certain settings, such as healthcare facilities and congregate care settings, pose increased challenges and urgency for controlling the spread of this disease because of the vulnerable patient and resident populations that they serve. Unvaccinated personnel in such settings have an unacceptably high risk of both acquiring COVID -19 and transmitting the virus to colleagues and/or vulnerable patients or residents, exacerbating staffing shortages, and causing unacceptably high risk of complications. In response to this significant public health threat, through this emergency regulation, the Department is requiring covered entities to ensure their personnel are fully vaccinated against COVID -19, and to document evidence thereof in appropriate records. Covered entities are also required to review and make determinations on medical exemption requests, and provide rea sonable accommodations therefor to protect the wellbeing of the patients, residents and personnel in such facilities. Documentation and information regarding personnel vaccinations as well as exemption requests granted are required to be provided to the De partment immediately upon request. Based on the foregoing, the Department has determined that these emergency regulations are necessary to control the spread of COVID -19 in the identified regulated facilities or entities. As described above, current circumstances and the risk of spread to vulnerable resident and patient populations by unvaccinated personnel in these settings necessitate immediate action and, pursuant to the State 155a Administrative Procedure Act Section 202(6), a delay in the issuance of thes e emergency regulations would be contrary to public interest. 156aTITLE: SECTION 2.61 PREVENTION OF COVID- 19 TRANSMISSION BY COVERED ENTITIES Effective Date 01/21/2022 Section 2.61 Prevention of COVID -19 transmission by covered entities. (a) Definitions.

A., NURSE A., DR. C., NURSE D., DR. F., DR. G, THERAPIST I., DR. J., NURSE J., DR. M, NURSE N., DR. O., DR. P., TECHNOLOGIST P., DR. S., NURSE S. and PHYSICIAN LIAISON X., Plaintiffs, v. KATHY HOCHUL, Governor of the State of New York, in her official capacity; HOWARD A. ZUCKER, Commissioner of the New York State Department of Health, i n his official capacity; and LETITIA JAMES, Attorney General of the State of New York, in her official capacity, Defendants. Case No. 1:21-cv-1009 (DNH/ML) VERIFIED COMPLAINT Plaintiffs herein, proceeding under pseudonyms for the reasons set forth below, complain of the Defendants as follows: NATURE OF ACTION 1. This action seeks injunctive and declaratory relief from a New York State Department of Health (DOH) regulation, promul gated on August 26, 2021, that purports to nullify Title VII and the parallel protections of the New York State Human Rights Law 161a and the New York City Human Rights Law by mandating the COVID -19 vaccination of health care professionals with no exemption for sincere religious beliefs that compel the refusal of such vaccination (the \"Vaccine Mandate\"). 2. This \"emergency\" regulation, promulgated almost three months after the former Governor of New York ended the COVID -related \"state disaster emergency\" and resci nded all his pertinent executive orders, negates even the protection for sincere religious beliefs in a prior DOH regulation promulgated only days before, when the former Governor was still in office. 3. Plaintiffs have moved this Court for temporary and pr eliminary injunctive relief in view of the September 27, 2021 deadline for compliance with the Vaccine Mandate, after which plaintiffs, whose religious beliefs compel abstention from COVID -19 vaccination, will be harmed irreparably by loss of employment an d professional standing. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 4. This action arises under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. This action also arises under federal statutory laws, namely 42 U. S.C. \u00a7 1985(3) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e -2 5. This Court has jurisdiction over the instant matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1343.enue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(b)(2) because two of the defendants reside in this District and a substantial part of the events or omissio ns giving rise to 162a Plaintiffs' claims occurred in this District. 6. This Court is authorized to grant declaratory judgment under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201 -02, implemented through Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 7. This C ourt is authorized to grant Plaintiffs' prayer for temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief pursuant to Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 8. This Court is authorized to grant Plaintiffs' prayer for relief regarding costs, includ ing a reasonable attorney's fee, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. THE PARTIES Plaintiffs 9. As more particularly alleged below, the plaintiffs herein are medical professionals whose sincere religious beliefs compel them to refuse vaccination with the available COVID -19 vaccines, all of which employ aborted fetus cell lines in their testing, devel opment, or production. 10. All of the plaintiffs are employed by entities with 15 more employees covered by Title VII, which mandates the reasonable accommodation of sincere religious beliefs. Eight of the seventeen plaintiffs reside and work in this Distric t, while the others reside and/or work variously in the Southern, Eastern and Western Districts. 163a Defendants 11. Defendant Kathy Hochul (Hochul) is Governor of the State of New York who, as the State's chief executive, is responsible for the execution of its l aws and regulations, including the challenged vaccine mandate, and for the approval of all executive branch policies and directives, including those of the DOH pertaining to the vaccine mandate. At all pertinent times Hochul has acted and will act under co lor of state law. Defendant Hochul's principal place of business is located at the State Capitol Building, Albany, New York. She is sued in her official capacity. 12. Defendant Howard A. Zucker (Zucker) is Commissioner of Health for the DOH. He is responsibl e for promulgation and enforcement of the challenged vaccine mandate. At all pertinent times Zucker has acted and will act under color of state law. Defendant Zucker's principal place of business is located at 3959 Broadway, New York, NY 10032. He is sued in his official capacity. 13. Defendant LETITIA JAMES (James) is the Attorney General for the State of New York, the State's highest -ranking law enforcement officer charged with overall supervision of the enforcement of the challenged vaccine mandate and other laws of the State of New York. At all times relevant to this Complaint, James is and was acting under color of State law. Defendant James' principal place of business is located at the State Capitol Building, Albany, New York. She is sued in her of ficial capacity. BACKGROUND \"No one should be forced to be vaccinated against their will both because of the constitutional right to 164a refuse treatment , and pragmatically because forced vaccination will deter at least some people from seeking medical help when they need it.\" \"Following this flawed logic, several state -based proposals have sought to address any 'public health emergency,' ... [by] resort[ing] to punitive, police -state tactics , such as forced examinations , vaccination and treatment, and criminal sanctions for those individuals who did not follow the rules.\" -The American Civil Liberties Union in 2008 (before it became the Ant i-Civil Liberties Union) The Cuomo Administration and the \"Public Health Emergency\" Come to an End 14. On August 23, 2021, the People of the State of New York were definitively rescued from the nearly eighteen -month -long medical dictatorship of ex - Governor C uomo, who resigned in disgrace and forfeited the Emmy Award for his press conference \"performances\" as the savior of New York from the coronavirus.1 15. The legacy of Cuomo's medical dictatorship was the second highest COVID death rate per 100,000 in the c ountry \u2014with New Jersey in first place under the equally draconian and still -ongoing medical dictatorship of Governor Murphy.2 There is an 1 See Nick Niedzwiaek, \"Cuomo Loses Emmy following ongoing FBI investigation into official concealment of the 15,000 COVID deaths caused by Cuomo's order to return COVI D-positive patients to nursing homes after their discharge from the hospital.3 16. On June 25, 2021, two months before his last day in office, Cuomo finally rescinded his declaration of a \"State disaster emergency\" \u2014fifteen months after it was issued \u2014 along w ith all the executive orders that followed. There is no longer a public health emergency in the State of New York. Despite the incessant media fearmongering over the \"Delta variant\" and now the \"Mu variant,\" on September 7, 2021, only 47 deaths out of a s tate population of almost 20,000,000 could be attributed (however loosely) to the virus.4 The Vaccination Mandate Supersedes the Prior Health Order 17. The end of the Cuomo administration, however, has apparently not been accompanied by any institutional awareness of the failure of his policies to improve the lot of New Yorkers during the pandemic as compared to virtually every other State in the Union. O n the contrary, the defendant Health Commissioner, Howard A. Zucker, and Cuomo's only recently bumped to third worst in the nation, but only barely, by Mississippi. 3 See Michael Gold and Ed Shanahan, \"What We Know About Cuomo's Nursing https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/usa/new successor as Governor, defendant Governor Kathy Hochul (Hochul), continue to behave as if the \"disaster emergency\" had never ended \u2014and never will end. 18. Solely on the pretext o f what the DOH's Public Health and Health Planning Council (\"the Health Council\") deems \"a concerning national trend of increasing circulation of the SARS -CoV-2 Delta variant,\" Zucker and the DOH, with the assistance of defendant Attorney General Letitia J ames and the approval of Hochul as the State's chief executive, are now enforcing the Health Council's proposed COVID - 19 \"emergency\" regulation, the aforesaid Vaccine Mandate, effective only days ago, on August 26, 2021. 19. The Vaccine Mandate orders the CO VID-19 vaccination of the \"personnel\" of all \"covered entities\" in the field of medical and health services, including the Plaintiffs and all the hospitals, clinics, or private practices with which they are associated. See Exhibit A to this Complaint and NYCRR, Title 10, Part 2, \u00a7 2.61 (\"the Vaccine Mandate\"). 20. The Vaccine Mandate excludes any religious exemption from COVID -19 vaccination but permits medical exemptions. Yet, only days before, the superseded Public Health O rder issued in the waning days of the Cuomo administration (the \"prior Health Order\") \u2014one of the few things he got right \u2014provided a broad and indeed constitutionally required religious exemption: Religious exemption. Covered entities shall grant a religi ous exemption for COVID -19 vaccination for covered personnel if they hold a genuine and sincere religious belief contrary to the practice of immunization, subject to a 167a reasonable accommodation by the employer. Covered entities shall document such exemption s and such reasonable accommodations in personnel records or other appropriate records in accordance with applicable privacy laws by September 27, 2021, and continuously, as needed, thereafter. See Exhibit B to this Complaint (emphasis added) 21. The Vaccina tion Mandate declares that \"Covered entities shall continuously require personnel to be fully vaccinated against COVID -19, with the first dose for current personnel received by September 27, 2021 for general hospitals and nursing homes, and by October 7, 2 021 for other covered entities absent receipt of an exemption.\" Mandate at 2.61 (c) (emphasis added). 22. Ominously enough, by \"continuously ... fully vaccinated\" the Vaccine Mandate appears to contemplate however many \"booster shots\" of COVID vaccine federal and state health bureaucrats demand: \"'Fully vaccinated,' for the purposes of this section, shall be determined by the Department in accordance with applicable federal guidelines and recommendations.\" Id. at \u00a7 3. 23. In the State of Israel, where COVID vacc ines are already failing massively to \"contain the virus,\" the national government has announced that \"fully vaccinated\" now means three shots.5 Or perhaps four 5 \"Three doses not two: Israel sets new benchmark for full vaccination. It is on India's horizon as well,\" The Times of India , September 1, 2021 @ https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toieditorials/thr 168a shots very soon, as Israel's top health expert suggests.6 In this country, the Biden administration is already promoting the three shots = \"fully vaccinated\" narrative: \"It will make you safer, and for longer, and it will help us end the pandemic faster,\" said Biden said in a speech on August 18.7 24. As pleaded more particularly below, the Vaccine Mandate purports to override federal protections under Title VII, commanding employers to deny religious accommodation of sincere religious objections to vaccination \u2014a blatant violation of the Supremacy Claus e as well as the Free Exercise Clause. The Vaccine Mandate even nullifies parallel state law protections under the New York Human Rights Law and the New York City Human Rights Law. 25. Only days after the prior Health Order had declared \"Covered entities shall grant a religious exemption\" in recognition of federal and state law, the Vaccine Mandate effectively declared that \"covered entitles\" shall not grant a religious exemption. The targeting of a large class of religious objectors to mandatory vaccination among health professionals, who are very knowledgeable on this subject \u2014and expert says shot of Covid vaccine needed,\" September 5, 2021, Wio 169a notably at least 20% of the health care workforce in New York8\u2014is plainly evident. Yet any ill -informed college student can obtain a religious exemption from a panoply of vaccinat ions simply by filing a statement that \"he/she objects to immunization due to his/her religious beliefs.\" See Public Health Law \u00a7 2165. Reasons for Proceeding with Pseudonyms 26. The same \"front line\" health care workers hailed as heroes by the media for trea ting COVID patients before vaccines were available, including the Plaintiffs herein, are now vilified by the same media as pariahs who must be excluded from society until they are vaccinated against their will. 27. The Vaccine Mandate emerges in the context of an atmosphere of fear and irrationality in which the unvaccinated are threatened with being reduced to a caste of untouchables if they will not consent to being injected, even \"continuously,\" with vaccines that violate their religious beliefs, are clear ly not as effective as promised, and have known and increasingly evident risks of severe and even life - threatening side effects, including blood clots9 and what the CDC admits is \"a 'likely association' between a rare heart inflammatory condition in adole scents 8 See letter to defendants Zucker and Hochul from numerous members of the State Assembly @ https://www.scribd.com/ document/523955400/COVID -Vaccination -Letter#from_embed 9 Cf. authoritative study in the prestigious journal Nature : \"Antibody epitopes in vaccine -induced immune young adults [under age 30] mostly after they've received their second Covid -19 vaccine shot ... \"10 28. With caution thrown to the winds, everyone \u2014 the young and healthy, the old, the previously recovered and naturally immune, even pregnant and breastfeeding women \u2014is now being pressured by governments, businesses and educational institutions to submit to COVI D19 vaccination with no assessment of the risks or benefits for each individual or any consideration of medical necessity or contraindication in each particular case. Even the smallest children, at virtually no risk from the virus, are to be vaccinated as soon as a rushed approval can be obtained from the FDA. 29. For the sake of forcing people to be inoculated with novel vaccines regardless of risk or benefit, college admissions are being revoked, career paths blocked, employment terminated, and lives ruine d on a vast scale. Nothing like this has ever been seen in our nation. 30. And yet the CDC now admits that the COVID vaccines do not prevent viral transmission or infection, especially by the \"Delta variant.\"11 10 See Berkeley Lovelace, Jr. \"CDC safety group says there's a likely link between rare heart inflammation in young people after Covid shot,\" CNBC, June 23, 2021 @ https://tinyurl. com/sse5zsr9 11 Frank Diamond, Infection Control Today , \"Vaccines Not as Effecti ve against the Delta Variant, say CDC Data,\" August 25, 2021 -variant things now stand, according to \"public health authorities\" the vaccinated can infect the unvaccinated, the unvaccinated can infect the vaccinated, both the vaccinated and the unvaccinated can infect each other, and everyone must wear masks indoors in \"high transmission\" areas \u2014that is, virtually the entire country12\u2014as if no one at all had been vaccinated.13 And with both the \"fully vaccinated\" and the unvaccinated still contracting COVID, \"continuous\" \"booster shots\" of the same less - than -miraculous vaccines, to which plaintiffs have the same religious objections, are doubtless on the way, accompanied by f urther government mandates. 32. In the midst of this regulatory muddle, combined with unreasoning official coercion and widespread, media -generated panic, plaintiffs seek leave of court to proceed anonymously as they run the risk of ostracization, threats of harm, immediate firing and other retaliatory consequences if their names become known. This is shown by the following examples of a pervasive climate of fear and loathing of the unvaccinated: MSNBC guest Frank Schaeffer stating that those who are \"anti -vaccine\" are \"bio terrorists\" who should be the target of \"Drone strikes.\"14 12 See CDC Map at https://www.usatoday.com/in - -map-high-covid In the Eastern District of New York, where two of the Plaintiffs reside, an explicit death threat was made in a comment that had to be deleted (likely for fear of liability on the part of the publishers) (Exhibit C)15 Mayor de Blasio, announcing his \"vaccine passport\" for New York City, which affects several of the plaintiffs herein, declared that \"If you want to participate in our society fully, you've got to get vaccinated.\"16 On ABC News, commentator Margaret Hoover declared that government, by withholding all benefits from the unvaccinated, should \"just make it almost impossible for people to \u2014to live their lives without being protected and protecting the rest of us.\"17 On CNN, commentator Don Lemon stated to Chris Cuomo that \"[If ou] don't get the vaccine, you can't go to the supermarket. Don't have the vaccine, can't go to the ball game. Don't have a vaccine, can't go to work. You don't have a vaccine, can't come here. No shirt, no shoes, no his late night \"comedy\" show Jimmy Kimmel stated that the unvaccinated who contract COVID should be allowed to die rather than being admitted to the hospital: \" Rest in peace, wheezy.\"19 The audience roared its approval. Kimmel offered no such advice to the millions who seek emergency medical treatment after disregarding constant public health warnings against smoking, drinking, drug abuse, and junk food -induced Type II diabetes. In The Week , Ryan Cooper declared that \"Anti -vaxxers\" (i.e. people who decline the COVID vaccines) \"should be exiled from society until they get their shots, and their efforts to intimidate people against controlling the pandemic should be met with massive resis tance.\"20 33. Furthermore, plaintiffs' allegations below involve sensitive personal medical information concerning their vaccination status, the presence of antibodies, and whether they are breastfeeding or intending to become pregnant. 34. Under these circumsta nces, plaintiffs clearly meet the criteria for permission to proceed anonymously. See Memorandum of Law in Support of this application. 19 https://www.westernjournal.com/late Common Religious Beliefs Opposing Compulsory COVID -19 Vaccination 35. The following allegations detail plainti ffs' sincere religious conviction that they cannot consent to be inoculated, \"continuously\" or otherwise, with vaccines that were tested, developed or produced with fetal cells line derived from procured abortions, and the drastic consequences they now fac e absent emergency injunctive relief. 36.The seventeen plaintiffs in this action \u2014 practicing doctors, M.D.s fulfilling their residency requirement, nurses, a nuclear medicine technologist, a cognitive rehabilitation therapist and a physician's liaison \u2014are uni ted in their conscientious religious objection as Christians to being inoculated at all, much less \"continuously,\" with any of the available COVID -19 vaccines because they all employ fetal cell lines derived from procured abortion in testing, development or production of the vaccines. In particular: Johnson & Johnson/Janssen: Fetal cell cultures are used to produce and manufacture the J&J COVID -19 vaccine and the final formulation of this vaccine includes residual amounts of the fetal host cell proteins (0.15 mcg) and/or host cell DNA (3 ng). Pfizer/BioNTech: The HEK -293 abortion - related cell l ine was used in research related to the development of the Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine. 175aModerna/NIAID: Aborted fetal cell lines were used in both the development and testing of Moderna's COVID -19 vaccine. 37.Plaintiffs hold in common the following sincere religious beliefs concerning abortion -connected vaccines: a) They oppose abortion under any circumstances, as they believe that abortion is the intrinsically evil killing of an innocent, and thus they also oppo se the use of abortion -derived fetal cell lines for medical purposes and abortionderived fetal stem cell research. b)It would be a violation of their deeply held religious beliefs and moral consciences to take any of the available COVID -19 vaccines given th eir use of abortion -derived fetal cell lines in testing, development, or production. c)By receiving one of the COVID vaccines currently available, all of which are abortion - connected, they believe they would be cooperating with the evil of abortion in a manner that violates their consciences and that they would sin gravely if they acted agai nst their consciences by taking any of these vaccines. d)They agree with the teaching of spiritual leaders, including certain Catholic bishops, who urge Christians to refuse said vaccines to avoid cooperation in abortion and to bear witness against it witho ut compromise, and who defend the right to a religious exemption from vaccination with such vaccines. 176ae)They do not accept the opinion \u2014expressed by certain other Catholic bishops, the Pope included \u2014that there is a therapeutically proportional reason to reso rt to abortion -connected vaccines which can justify \"remote\" cooperation in abortion. They reject as a matter of religious conviction any medical cooperation in abortion, no matter how \"remote.\"21 f)They believe in the primacy of conscience in this matter. While one may personally conclude that recourse to abortion -connected vaccines can be justified in his or her case, vaccination is not morally obligatory and must be voluntary, and those who in conscience refuse vaccination need only take other protective measures to avoid spreading the virus.22 g)Although they are not \"anti -vaxxers\" who oppose all vaccines, they believe as a matter of religious conviction that the ensouled human person, made in the image and likeness of God, is inviolable as a temple of t he Holy Ghost and that civil authorities have no right to force anyone to be medicated or vaccinated against his or her will, whether or not the medication or vaccine is abortion -connected. 21See, Exhibit D (collecting statements of Catholic prelates, who call for conscientious abstention from abortion -connected vaccines). 22 See, \"Note on the Morality of Using into each person's formulation of a conscientious religious position on the morality of vaccinations.23 Plaintiffs are all aware of the vaccines' side effects, which can be quite serious, their fading efficacy, requiring \"booster shots,\" their evident inability to prevent transmission or infection, ( see Exhibit F)24 and the fact that natural immunity is likely more protective than injections with the available COVID -19 vaccines.24 These medical facts inform Plaintiffs' religious conviction against involuntary or coerced vaccination as an i nvasion of bodily autonomy contrary to their religious beliefs. Given that the Vaccine Mandate requires that employers insure that employees are \"continuously\" \"fully vaccinated\" \u2014 as many times as the government advises \u2014Plaintiffs now reasonably fear that \"booster shots\" of the same vaccines they consider immoral will soon be demanded by the government as a condition of employment and even normal life 23See, \"A Letter from the Colorado Bishops on COVID -19 Vaccine Man dates,\" August On 2021, during a CNN interview, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky stated that because of the new spread of the delta variant, \"wha t [the COVID vaccines] can't do anymore is prevent transmission ,\" (emphasis added), http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2108/05/sitroom.02.html; see also Exhibit F (reproducing transcript of this interview). 24 See, Exhibit E (on the science pertaining to natural versus vaccine -induced immunity). 178ain society, as is already the case with the original vaccines. Plaintiff \"Dr. A.\" 38. Plaintiff A., M.D. (\"Dr. A.\"), who is Catholic, is a board -certified Anatomic and Clinical Pathologist on staff at a private hospital in the Northern District, where he performs pathology testing and diagnosis under contract with the hospital. 39.On Augus t 12, 2021, Dr. A., who seeks a religious exemption from COVID vaccination based on the religious beliefs enumerated in \u00b6 37 (a) -(h), was informed by the hospital administration via email that the hospital would be mandating the Covid -19 vaccination for al l employees and medical staff members who provide on -site care. Unvaccinated staff members could refuse the vaccine without penalty but would be required to undergo weekly testing. 40.This policy changed on or about August 20, 2021, due to the DOH's issua nce of the prior Health Order, which eliminated testing in lieu of vaccination but did allow both medical and religious exemptions. 41. On August 27, 2021, however, the hospital policy changed again after DOH issued the Vaccinate Mandate removing the religious exemption provision under the prior Health Order. 42. Knowing that religious exemptions had been banned by the DOH, on August 31, 20 21, Dr. A. sent the hospital administration the required form for a medical exemption instead, but has not yet received a reply. 43. Refusal to receive an abortion -connected COVID -19 vaccine will imminently result in the loss 179a of Dr. A's position at the hospit al and this termination of employment would have to be mentioned in Dr. A.'s license renewal statements, which could trigger disciplinary proceedings against him. 44. Dr. A. is now also at risk of disciplinary charges by the DOH or otherwise that could resu lt in loss of his license if he refuses, as he must, vaccination with any of the currently available abortion -connected vaccines. There is also the threat that the DOH will make COVID -19 vaccination a condition of renewal or threaten license suspension or revocation in order further to coerce Dr. A. to be vaccinated with a vaccine he cannot take in good conscience. 45. The imminent loss of his position and staff privileges at the hospital with which Dr. A. is affiliated will make it impossible to conduct his practice and will also render him unemployable anywhere in the State of New York as no other hospital would place him on the pathology staff under the Vaccine Mandate. 46. Dr. A. will suffer imminent irreparable harm to his occupation, reputation, and professi onal standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Vaccine Mandate. Plaintiff \"Nurse A.\" 47. Plaintiff A., R.N. (\"Nurse A.\"), who is Catholic, is a registered nurse, licensed in the State of New York, who works in a major medical center in the Southern District. 48. Nurse A. has cared for numerous dialysis patients with COVID during the pandemic with out need of vaccination. 180a49.On August 20, 2021, Nurse A. received a religious exemption from COVID vaccination from her hospital, based on the religious beliefs enumerated in \u00b6 37 (a) -(h),On August 30, 2021, however, Nurse A. received an email revoking her r eligious exemption because of the Vaccine Mandate, which email stated that her hospital \"must follow NYS DOH requirements as they evolve. This means that [the hospital] can no longer consider any religious exemptions to the COVID vaccination even those previously approved .\" 50.Said email further warned that \"employees who do not comply with the vaccination program by the deadlines above will be placed off duty for seven days without pay, and given those seven days to meet the program requirements. Employees who choose not to meet the program requirements after seven days will be deemed to have opted to resign.\" 51.Nurse A. has been given a deadline of September 15, 2021 to receive the \"first dose\" of COVID vaccine. 52. Termination of Nurse A.'s employment will be devastating to her and her family. Nurse A. will also be unemployable anywhere in the State of New York as no other hospital would hire her under the Vaccine Mandate. 53.Nurse A.'s termination will have to be reported at the time of license renewal and may w ell trigger disciplinary proceedings against her. There is also the threat that the DOH will make COVID -19 vaccination a condition of her license renewal to further coerce compliance. 181a 54. Nurse A. is now also under the threat of disciplinary proceedings by t he DOH, including license suspension or revocation as measure of coercion to take a vaccine that in her informed medical judgment she cannot take in good conscience. 55. Nurse A. will suffer imminent irreparable harm to her occupation, reputation, and profess ional standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Vaccine Mandate. Plaintiff \"Dr. C.\" 56. Plaintiff C, M.D. (\"Dr. C.\"), who is Catholic, is a board -certified ophthalmologist who is an attending physician with admitting privileges a t a private hospital in the Northern District, and he also directs a large private surgical practice. 57. During 2020, Dr. C.'s large practice group performed almost 10,000 surgeries without a single case or outbreak of COVID -19 traceable to his practice and without vaccination of anyone on staff. 58. Prior to the Vaccine Mandate, religious exemption and periodic testing in lieu of vaccination were allowed under the prior Health Order that the Vaccine Mandate superseded, as to which exemption Plaintiff Dr. C. was in discussions with hospital management. 59. Plaintiff Dr. C. has now been advised by said hospital that on account of the Vaccine Mandate he must be COVID -vaccinated by September 27, 2021, and that there is no religious exemption. 60. Dr. C.'s written reques t for an exemption, reflecting the religious beliefs enumerated in \u00b6 37 (a) - 182a(h), was thus denied on September 1, the same day it was submitted. 61. The imminent loss of admitting privileges at the hospital with which Dr. C is affiliated will make it impossible to conduct his practice, as he cannot conduct ophthalmic and maxillofacial surgery without the ability to admit patients to a hospital if the n eed arises. 62. The imminent loss of privileges will also render Dr. C. unemployable anywhere in the State of New York as no other hospital would grant him privileges under the Vaccine Mandate. 63. The imminent loss of privileges will have to be reported at the time of licen se renewal and may well trigger disciplinary proceedings against Dr. C. There is also the threat that the DOH will make COVID -19 vaccination a condition of license renewal in a further bid to coerce compliance. 64. Dr. C. is now also under the threat of disci plinary proceedings by the DOH, including license suspension or revocation, for refusing to obey the Vaccine Mandate by taking a vaccine that in his informed medical judgment he cannot take in good conscience. 65.Dr. C. will suffer imminent irreparable harm to his occupation, reputation, and professional standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Vaccine Mandate. Plaintiff \"Nurse D.\" 66. Plaintiff D., R.N. (\"Nurse D.\"), who is Catholic, is a registered nurse, licensed in the State of New York, who works at a private hospital in the Northern 183aDistrict. She has two sons and a husband, and her job is a vital source income and health and dental insurance for her family. 67. Nurse D. attempted to obtain a religious exemption from her hospi tal, based on the religious beliefs enumerated in \u00b6 37 (a) -(h), but it was denied on account of the Vaccine Mandate. She has been advised by management that if she is not vaccinated by September 27, she will be deemed to have \"voluntarily resigned.\" 68.In a memo issued September 7, 2021, management further advised that the employment of Nurse D. and any other employee refusing vaccination under the Vaccine Mandate will end on September 28, the separation will be \"deemed\" to be voluntary, meaning no unemploym ent benefits, and all health and other benefits will terminate. 69. Termination of Nurse D's employment will be devastating to her and her family. Nurse D. has more than $50,000 of student loans from her nursing program alone. 70. Nurse D. will also be unemplo yable anywhere in the State of New York as no other hospital would hire her under the Vaccine Mandate. 71. Nurse D.'s termination will have to be reported at the time of license renewal and may well trigger disciplinary proceedings against her. There is also the threat that the DOH will make COVID -19 vaccination a condition of her license renewal to further coerce compliance. 184a72. Nurse D. is now also under the threat of disciplinary proceedings by the DOH, including license suspension or revocation as measure of coercion to take a vaccine that in her informed medical judgment she cannot take in good conscience. 73.Nurse D. will suffer imminent irreparable harm to her occupation, reputation, and professional standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Vaccine Mandate. Plaintiff \"Dr. F.\" 74. Plaintiff F., D.D.S., M.D. (\"Doctor F.\"), who is Catholic, is a board -certified Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon, licensed in dentistry and medicine in the State of New York. 75. Dr. F. is employed by a private hospital in the Northern District, where he is on staff and has admitting privileges in addition to his private practice. 76.Dr. F. and his partners have treated numerous patients who were sick with COVID without need of vaccination. Patients with COVID were not turned away but received dental treatment that was urgently needed. Dr. F.'s clinic is vital to the region in which i t is located and cannot turn away patients in need of urgent care. 77. Although he was granted a religious exemption from COVID vaccination under the prior Health Order, the Vaccine Mandate has forced his hospital employer to revoke it and he was notified by hospital administration that if he fails to provide proof of vaccination by September 21, 2021, his hospital privileges will be suspended. 185a 78. In addition to the concerns about the scientific questions pertaining to the available COVID -19 vaccines noted in \u00b6 37(h), Dr. F. also knows of two people who have died, one who had a heart attack, and many others who have been injured following injection with a COVID vaccine. These medical facts inform Dr. F's religious objection to involuntary vaccination of any kind , including COVID vaccines, although he is not \"anti -vax\" in general. 79. The imminent loss of admitting privileges at the hospital with which Dr. F is affiliated will make it impossible to conduct his practice, as he cannot conduct oral and maxillofacial sur gery without the ability to admit patients to a hospital if the need arises. 80. The imminent loss of privileges will also render Dr. F. unemployable anywhere in the State of New York as no other hospital would grant him privileges under the Vaccine Mandate, which he cannot in conscience obey. 81. The imminent loss of privileges will have to be reported at the time of license renewal and may well trigger disciplinary proceedings against Dr. F. There is also the threat that the DOH will make COVID -19 vaccination a condition of license renewal in a further bid to coerce compliance with the Vaccine Mandate. 82. Dr. F. is now also under the threat of disciplinary proceedings by the DOH, including license suspension or revocation \u2014yet another measure of coercion to take a vaccine that in his informed medical judgment he cannot take in good conscience. 186a 83. Dr. F. will suffer imminent irreparable harm to his occupation, reputation, and professional standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Vaccine Mandate. Plaintiff Dr. \"G.\" 84. Plaintiff G., M.D. (\"Dr. G.\"), who is Catholic, is a board -certified specialist in Internal Medicine, licensed in the State of New York, who is employed by two private hospitals operated by a health service in the Western District at which he has staff and admitting privileges. Dr. G also directs an internal medicine residency program in which he instructs dozens of M.D.s who are fulfilling their residency requirements. 85. Dr. G., who seeks a religious exemption from COVID vaccination based on the beliefs enu merated in \u00b6 37 (a) -(h), has been informed by the Medical Affairs Department that there is no religious exemption from the Vaccine Mandate and that if he is not \"fully vaccinated\" by September 27 he will not be allowed to enter any of the buildings of the health service, including the hospitals in which he works and teaches. 86. The imminent loss of Dr. G.'s positions and admitting privileges at the hospitals with which he is affiliated will make it impossible for him to conduct his practice. 87. The imminent los s of his positions and privileges will also render Dr. G. unemployable anywhere in the State of New York as no other hospital would grant him privileges under the Vaccine Mandate, which he cannot in conscience obey. 187a88. The imminent loss of privileges and the termination of his employments will have to be reported at the time of license renewal and may well trigger disciplinary proceedings against Dr. G. There is also the threat that the DOH will make COVID -19 vaccination a condition of his license renewal. 89. Dr. G. is now also under the threat of disciplinary proceedings by the DOH, including license suspension or revocation as a further measure of coercion to take a vaccine that in his informed medical judgment he cannot take in good conscience. 90. Dr. G. will suffer imminent irreparable harm to his occupation, reputation, and professional standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Vaccine Mandate. Plaintiff \"Therapist I.\" 91. Plaintiff I. (\"Therapist I.\"), who is Catholic, is a certif ied brain injury specialist who provides cognitive rehabilitation and other assistance to patients, groups of patients, their families and visitors at a facility located in the Northern District. 92. In October of 2020, Therapist I. treated COVID patients as a TNA (temporary nurses' aide) on a dedicated COVID Unit in a nursing home. Therapist I. was part of a team that the parent facility set up to travel among its properties when the destination facility was in a staffing crisis. Therapist I. did not require any form of vaccination to treat these patients but rather was tested twice a week. 93. Therapist I. knows of two colleagues who were \"fully vaccinated\" yet still contracted COVID -19 and had to be quarantined. These medical facts, along 188a with those recited he rein above, inform Therapist I's religious objection to involuntary vaccination as a violation of human dignity. 94. Therapist I., who seeks a religious exemption from COVID vaccination based on the beliefs noted in \u00b6 37 (a) -(h), has been advised by his emplo yer, a rehabilitation center, that, because of the Vaccine Mandate, he must receive \"at least the first dose\" of an abortion connected vaccine by September 27, 2021. 95. Therapist I. is now facing imminent termination of his employment and damage to his reput ation and future employment prospects if he refuses to be vaccinated against his religious belief. 96. Therapist I. is also at risk of action against his certification in EMS as the DOH imposing the Vaccine Mandate also regulates the granting, oversight and renewal of his EMT -B certificate. 97. Therapist I will thus suffer imminent irreparable harm to his occupation, reputation, and professional standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Vaccine Mandate. Plaintiff \"Doctor J.\" 98. Plaintiff J., D.O., who is Catholic, is a Doctor of Osteopathy (\"Dr. J.\"), licensed in the State of New York, whose specialty is Obstetrics and Gynecology, for which she is boardcertified. She has admitting privileges at a private hospital in the Western District in addition to her private prac tice. 99. Dr. J. believes she has probably treated dozens of women with COVID, most of whom were asymptomatic, and may have had an asymptomatic case of COVID herself. She works in Labor and 189a Delivery two days per week, training residents, and cares for \"unass igned patients\" who don't have a doctor. All patients are tested for COVID. Sometimes if the delivery was happening quickly, Dr. J. would have to run into the room without knowing the patient's COVID status, and there was not always time to wear proper per sonal protection equipment (PPE). She would find out after the fact that the patient was COVID -positive. Dr. J. has had 5 to 8 patients who were admitted specifically due to complications of COVID in pregnancy. She assisted in their treatment even while s he herself was pregnant. 100. As an OBGYN, Dr. J. has always practiced in accord with the dictates of her personal religious convictions, including the beliefs enumerated above, and she does not perform any form of abortion or sterilization procedure, nor pre scribe any contraceptive that could induce an unintentional abortion. 101. Dr. J. is currently breastfeeding her daughter, is aware of reports of the death of breastfeeding infants following maternal vaccination, and is not aware of any studies to date that would prove safety in breastfeeding or during pregnancy, which is of particular concern to her as an OB -GYN. Her hospital's own notice of the Vaccination Mandate advises breastfeeding women hesitantly as follows: \"Evidence about the safety and effectiveness of COVID -19 vaccination during pregnancy is growing ... It's best to talk to your OB -GYN or pediatrician about any questions or concerns you have.\" 190aThese medical facts, along with those recited herein above, inform Dr. J.'s religious conviction against i nvoluntary vaccination as an invasion of bodily autonomy that is contrary to Catholic Church teaching, especially in the case of COVID vaccination while she is breast -feeding or pregnant, when the welfare of her child is also implicated. 102. Dr. J., who seeks a religious exemption from COVID vaccination that reflects the beliefs set forth in \u00b6 37 (a) -(h), has been advised by hospital management that unless she has the \"first shot\" of COVID vaccine by September 27, she can no longer have admitting privileges at the hospital. 103. Refusal to receive an abortion -connected COVID -19 vaccine will imminently result in the loss of Dr. J.'s admitting privileges, which will make it impossible to conduct her practice. 104. The loss of privileges due to refusal to comply with the Vaccine Mandate would have to be mentioned in her license renewal statements, which could trigger disciplinary proceedings against Dr. J. 105. There is also the threat that the DOH will make COVID -19 vaccination a condition of renewal or threaten license su spension or revocation in order further to coerce Dr. J. to be vaccinated with a vaccine she does not need in her informed medical judgment, does not want, and cannot take in good conscience. 106. The loss of admitting privileges at the hospital with which Dr. J. is affiliated will also render her unemployable anywhere in the State of New York as no other hospital would grant her admitting privileges under the Vaccine Mandate. 191a 107. Dr. J. will suffer imminent irreparable harm to her occupation, reputation, and professional standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Vaccine Mandate. Plaintiff \"Nurse J.\" 108. Plaintiff J., L.P.N. (\"Nurse J.\"), who is Baptist, i s a licensed practical nurse, licensed in the State of New York, who provides home nursing care for two private home care agencies doing business in the Eastern District. 109. Nurse J. has cared for COVID patients on an in -home basis, including a patient who h ad to be hospitalized for several months, on which occasion Nurse J had to be quarantined for two weeks. Nurse J. developed COVID -like symptoms and believes she has had the virus and thus has acquired natural immunity. 110. While not a Catholic, Nurse J. shar es the common beliefs of the plaintiffs, as enumerated above. 111. On September 6, 2021, Nurse J. sent a letter of protest concerning the Vaccine Mandate to the administration of the agencies for which she works, urging them not to capitulate to the State. But on September 7, 2021, Nurse J. was advised by management that there would be no religious exemptions from vaccination, \"much to our disappointment.\" 112. Nurse J. has requested a religious exemption but does not expect to receive one, given the Vaccine Mand ate. On September 9, 2021, Nurse J. was advised by the executive director of one of the agencies that employ her that no religious exemption 192ais possible due to the Vaccine Mandate and that \"my hands are tied.\" 113. Nurse J. is now facing imminent termination of her employment as of October 7, 2021, the compliance date for entities other than hospitals and nursing homes under the Vaccine Mandate. She will also be unemployable anywhere in the State of New York as no other hospital would hire her under the Vacci ne Mandate. 114. Nurse J.'s termination will have to be reported at the time of license renewal and may well trigger disciplinary proceedings against her. There is also the threat that the DOH will make COVID -19 vaccination a condition of her license renewal. 115. Nurse J. i s now also under the threat of disciplinary proceedings by the DOH, including license suspension or revocation as a further measure of coercion to take a vaccine that in her informed medical judgment she cannot take in good conscience. 116. Nurse J. will suffe r imminent irreparable harm to her occupation, reputation, and professional standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Vaccine Mandate. Plaintiff \"Dr. M.\" 117. Plaintiff M., M.D. (\"Dr. M\"), who is Catholic, is a medical school grad uate in the process of completing her residency at a private hospital in the Western District. 118. On August 19, 2021, during the short time the prior Health Order was in effect, Dr. M. received an email from Human Resources advising that all residents must be vaccinated for COVID -19 and that 193a \"Information regarding waivers for medical or religious reaso ns will be available shortly.\" 119. On August 25, 2021, however, Dr. M. received an email from administration warning that \"disregarding the NYS Vaccination Mandate may affect your ability to continue working and training with your residency or fellowship pro gram.\" There was no indication of an allowance for religious exemptions. 120. On August 30, 2021, Dr. M. received another email from HR advising that \"Late last week, the NYS Public Health & Planning Council and the NYS Commissioner of Health removed the reli gious exemption for the recent state mandate requiring all health professionals get vaccinated for COVID -19.\" Dr. M. was thus barred from obtaining the religious exemption from COVID vaccination that she seeks, based on the religious beliefs enumerated ab ove. 121. In addition to the medical concerns recited in \u00b637 (h), Dr. M. has personally witnessed a medical student having a seizure after receiving the one -shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine. She collapsed to the floor and a rapid response team was summoned becau se she was unresponsive. She recovered with the assistance of the team. These medical facts inform Dr. M.'s religious conviction against involuntary vaccination. 122. On September 3, 2021, the hospital administration further advised Dr. M. by email that she m ust receive the \"first dose\" of a COVID vaccine by September 27 and that \"Disregarding the NYS Vaccination Mandate may affect your ability to 194a continue working and training with your residency or fellowship program.\" 123. Dr. M. has met with her program directo r to discuss her religious objection to COVID vaccination, but was met only with reiteration of the warning that her residency was at risk if she did not accept vaccination. 124. Dr. M. now faces the imminent loss of her residency and thus the destruction of h er entire career as she can never become a fully licensed physician and practice independently without completing a residency. 125. Given the Vaccine Mandate, Dr. M. will be unable to find a residency anywhere in the State of New York due to her conscientious religious abstention from vaccination. 126. Further, termination of her residency for refusal to obey the Vaccine Mandate in violation of her religious belief is likely to have adverse consequences for Dr. M.'s licensure in New York or any other jurisdiction. 127. Dr. M. will suffer imminent irreparable harm to her occupation, reputation, and professional standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Vaccine Mandate. Plaintiff \"Nurse N.\" 128. Plaintiff N., B.S.N, R.N. -C.(\"Nurse N.), who is Catholic, is a Bachelor's -prepared, medical -surgical certified Registered Nurse, licensed in the State of New York, who works at a hospital in the Northern District. 195a129. On August 19, 2021, Nurse N., under the prior regime that included the Health Order, rec eived an exemption from COVID vaccination on the basis of anticipated pregnancy and current breastfeeding, and thus did not submit an additional request to her employer for religious exemption, which she would have done, based on the beliefs enumerated abo ve, had her request for exemption related to pregnancy and breastfeeding been denied. Nurse N.'s request for exemption was approved as a \"vaccination deferral.\" 130. On September 1, 2021, however, Nurse N. was notified by hospital administration that the Vaccine Mandate had eliminated all exemptions for religion and pregnancy, that her exemption was thus revoked, and that she must receive at least one dose of a COVID -19 vaccine by September 21. 131. Nurse N. does not accept the view that recourse to abortion -connected vaccines can be justified as \"remote\" cooperation in abortion. She rejects any medical cooperation in abortion, \"remote\" or otherwise. 132. Nurse N. also believes and follows the religious teaching of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith that vaccination is not morally obligatory. Nurse N. does not oppose vaccination generally, and is not an \"anti -vaxxer,\" but does oppose government imposition of any medication or vaccine without informed consent, which she views with sincere religious conviction as a violation of the dignity of the human person. 133. Further, Nurse N. has had COVID -19, from which she recovered. As a medical professional who has read the pertinent medical literature, Nurse N. 196a knows that she has natural immunity that is superior to the vaccine -induced immunity that is already fading, that she is in no need of vaccination by any form of COVID vaccine, and that all available COVID vaccines have known and quite serious sid e effects, including death. 134. Nurse N. also knows that in her county \"fully vaccinated\" patients now comprise the majority of COVID cases according to testing results (25 out of 41 cases), which is why \"health experts\" are now calling for \"booster shots,\" which she fears will be demanded of her under the Vaccine Mandate, which requires that employees \"continuously\" be \"fully vaccinated,\" however many times the government demands. These medical facts inform Nurse N.'s religious conviction against involunta ry vaccination as an invasion of bodily autonomy that is contrary to Church teaching. 135. Plaintiff is now facing imminent loss of her employment, which is essential to the support of her family, on account of her religious abstention from COVID -19 vaccinatio n. 136. Nurse N. will also be unemployable anywhere in the State of New York as no other hospital would hire her due to her conscientious refusal to obey the Vaccine Mandate. 137. Nurse N.'s termination will have to be reported at the time of license renewal and m ay well trigger disciplinary proceedings against her. There is also the threat that the DOH will make COVID -19 vaccination a condition of her license renewal. 197a138. Nurse N. is now also under the threat of disciplinary proceedings by the DOH, including licens e suspension or revocation as a further measure of coercion to take a vaccine that in her informed medical judgment she cannot take in good conscience. 139. Nurse N. will suffer imminent irreparable harm to her occupation, reputation, and professional standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Vaccine Mandate. Plaintiff \"Dr. O.\" 140. Plaintiff O., M.D. (\"Dr. O.\"), who is Catholic, is a board -certified General Surgeon, licensed in the State of New York. He is employed by a private hospi tal in the Northern District. 141. Dr. O. has treated and seen multiple patients for surgical problems (appendicitis, cholecystitis, soft tissue infections and other problems) who have had COVID. 142. On July 13, 2021, Dr. O. was granted a religious exemption from his hospital under the prior Health Order, which allowed for religious exemptions, but this has been revoked on account of the new Vaccine Mandate announced on August 26, removing the provision for religious exemptions. 143. Dr. O. has thus been advised by his employer that, because of the Vaccine Mandate, he must be \"fully vaccinated\" with an abortion -connected vaccine by September 21, and that \"under the emergency regulations the NYS DOH will not permit exemptions or deferr als for sincerely held religious beliefs ... \" As the employer further advised: \"any colleague who was previously approved for one of 198a the above exemptions/deferrals [including religious exemption] will be required to provide proof of [vaccination] ... \" 144. Dr. O . now faces imminent loss of his privileges at the hospital where he performs surgery. Without admitting privileges, he would not be able to operate a private surgical practice as he would not have the capacity to admit patients to a hospital if need be. 145. The imminent loss of his staff position and hospital privileges will also render Dr. O. unemployable anywhere in the State of New York as no other hospital would hire him under the Vaccine Mandate, given his religiously motivated refusal to follow it. 146. The imminent loss of Dr. O's staff position and hospital privileges will have to be reported at the time of license renewal and may well trigger disciplinary proceedings against him. There is also the threat that the DOH will make COVID -19 vaccination a co ndition of his license renewal. 147. Dr. O. is now also under the threat of disciplinary proceedings by the DOH, including license suspension or revocation as a further measure of coercion \"continuously\" to be inoculated with a vaccine that in his informed med ical judgment he cannot take in good conscience. 148. Dr. O. will suffer imminent irreparable harm to his occupation, reputation, and professional standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Vaccine Mandate. 199a Plaintiff \"Dr. P.\" 149. Plaintiff P., D.O. (\"Dr. P.\"), who is Catholic, is a third -year obstetrics and gynecology resident at private hospital in the Western District. 150. Midway through her first year of training, the COVID -19 pandemic broke out, and Dr. P. cared for many patients inf ected with the virus, often with limited or no PPE. No vaccination was needed or required for her to treat patients safely. 151. In March 2020, Dr. P. was assigned to an ICU rotation, standard for a first -year resident, during which she helped care for the si ckest patients in the hospital, many suffering from COVID. It was during this time that Dr. P. herself became sick with the virus, from which she recovered before returning to work. 152. As a Catholic, Dr. P. intends to practice medicine in line with the mora l teachings of the Church, including the beliefs enumerated in \u00b6 37 (a) - (h), which is why she chose her current residency program, in reliance on which she and her husband moved from Texas to Buffalo. 153. As a medical doctor who has recovered from COVID, Dr. P. knows that she has natural immunity, shown by numerous studies to be superior to the vaccine -induced immunity that is already fading; that the COVID vaccines now available do not limit viral transmission, as shown by the rising demand for \"booster shot s\" (including a fourth shot in Israel); and that vaccinating a naturally immune person can do more harm than good by provoking a hyperimmune response. 200a 154. On August 19, 2021, during the short time the prior Health Order was in effect, Dr. P. received an ema il from Human Resources advising that all residents must be vaccinated for COVID -19 and that \"Information regarding waivers for medical or religious reasons will be available shortly.\" This email also states that \"disregarding the NYS Vaccination Mandate m ay affect your ability to continue working and training with your residency or fellowship program.\" 155. On August 30, 2021, Dr. P. received another email from HR advising that \"Late last week, the NYS Public Health & Planning Council and the NYS Commissioner of Health removed the religious exemption for the recent state mandate requiring all health professio nals get vaccinated for COVID -19.\" 156. On September 7, Dr. P. was directed to meet with the OB/GYN department chair, who attempted to pressure her into being vaccinated with the suggestion that, as she had been advised on August 19, \"disregarding the NYS Vacc ination Mandate may affect your ability to continue working and training with your residency or fellowship program.\" 157. Dr. P. now faces the imminent loss of her residency and thus destruction of her entire career as she can never become a fully licensed ph ysician and practice independently without completing a residency. 158. Given the Vaccine Mandate, Dr. P. will be unable to find a residency anywhere in the State of New York due to her conscientious religious abstention from vaccination. 201a 159. Further, terminatio n of her residency for refusal to obey the Vaccine Mandate in violation of her religious belief is likely to have adverse consequences for her full licensure in New York or any other jurisdiction. 160. Dr. P. will suffer imminent irreparable harm to her occupa tion, reputation, and professional standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Vaccine Mandate. Plaintiff \"Technologist P.\" 161. Plaintiff P. (\"Technologist P.\"), who is Catholic, is a Nuclear Medicine Technologist, licensed in the State of New York, who is employed by a private health organization in the Eastern District. 162. On or about August 18, 2021, with the prior Health Order in effect, Technologist P. was advised by her employer that she must be vaccinated with a COVID vaccine unless she obtained a religious exemption, for which she applied on August 26, 2021, with extensive explanation and documentation of her sincere religious belief. 163. After the Vaccine Mandate eliminated religious exemptions on August 26, however, Technologist P. was advised by her employer by email on September 1, 2021, that her pending request for religious exemption had been rejected because \"on August 26, 2021, the DOH announced that religious exemptions are not permitted under the State mandate. It is for this reason that we are unable to grant your request for a religious exemption.\" 164. Technologist P.'s employer warned in said email that she must receive at least her \"first shot\" of 202a one of the abortion -connected vaccines by September 27, 2020 and that \"If you choose to not receive your first shot between now and September 27, 2021, you will be noncompliant with the NYS mandate and your continued employment will be at risk.\" 165. Technologist P. has been further advised by her manager that, as of September 27, if she fails to be vaccinated against her religious belief, her security badge will be deactivated, she will not be able to access her place of employment and will essentially be regarded as a trespasser. 166. In addition to the medical facts recited in \u00b6 37 (h), Technologist P. knows of a coworker who collapsed after vaccination from a severe allergic reaction, requiring the calling of a code and the administration of Benadryl and steroids for a month, and who returned to work visibly miserable, covered in a rash, itchy, jittery, and shaking. Technologist P. has also observed that 50 percent of her colleagues who contract COVID and are out sick have been \"fully vaccinated,\" and that there is a regular flow of \"f ully vaccinated\" patients being admitted to her hospital. 167. In addition to the medical concerns recited herein above, Technologist P. is breastfeeding, and there are limited data on the safety of COVID vaccines for the breastfeeding child, with reports o f infant death following vaccination of the breastfeeding mother. These medical facts inform Technologist P.'s religious conviction against involuntary vaccination as an invasion of bodily autonomy contrary to Church teaching. 168. Technologist P. now faces im minent loss of her employment, as well as loss of her certification in 203a disciplinary proceedings, if she refuses, as she must, any of the available COVID vaccines. 169. Any discharge from employment on account Technologist's P's conscientious and religiously motivated refusal to take any of the available abortion -connected vaccines would have to be reported upon renewal of Technologist P's certification. 170. Plaintiff Technologist P. will thus suffer imminent irreparable harm to her occupation, reputation, and prof essional standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Vaccine Mandate. Plaintiff \"Dr. S.\" 171. Plaintiff S., D.D.S. (\"Dr. S.\"), who is Catholic, is a board -certified Oral and Maxillofacial surgeon who, in addition to his private prac tice, is an attending physician with admitting privileges at a hospital in the Northern District. 172. Dr. S. and his partners have treated numerous patients who were sick with COVID without need of vaccination, and Dr. S. thus contracted COVID, from which he recovered. Patients with COVID were not turned away but received dental treatment that was urgently needed. 173. On August 17, 2021, under the then - applicable DOH vaccination requirement, which included the prior Health Order as of August 18, Dr. S. received a religious exemption from COVID -19 vaccination. The exemption was based on his religious convictions as a Catholic, including the beliefs enumerated above. 204a 174. On September 1, however, Dr. S.'s religious exemption was revoked due to the issuance of the Vaccin e Mandate, and he was notified by hospital administration that if he fails to provide proof of vaccination by September 21, 2021, his hospital privileges will be suspended. 175. As a licensed physician who has recovered from COVID, Dr. S. knows that he has nat ural immunity, shown by studies he has reviewed to be superior to the vaccine -induced immunity that is already fading. See Exhibit E. 176. The imminent loss of admitting privileges at the hospital with which Dr. S is affiliated will make it impossible to cond uct his practice, as he cannot conduct oral and maxillofacial surgery without the ability to admit patients to a hospital if the need arises. 177. The imminent loss of privileges will also render Dr. S. unemployable anywhere in the State of New York as no othe r hospital would grant him privileges under the Vaccine Mandate. 178. The imminent loss of privileges will have to be reported at the time of license renewal and may well trigger disciplinary proceedings against Dr. S. There is also the threat that the DOH wi ll make COVID -19 vaccination a condition of license renewal. 179. Dr. S. is now also under the threat of disciplinary proceedings by the DOH, including license suspension or revocation as a further measure of coercion to take a vaccine that in his informed medical judgment he cannot take in good conscience. 205a 180. Dr. S. will suffer imminent irreparable harm to his occupation, reputation, and professional standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Vaccine Mandate. Plaintiff \"Nurse S.\" 181. Plaintiff S., R.N. (\"Nurse S.\"), who is Catholic, is a registere d nurse employed by a hospital in the Northern District. 182. Nurse S. has treated a patient who had recovered from COVID but still decided to be vaccinated. After receiving the second dose of the vaccine, this patient needed high -flow oxygen to survive and w as not able to get out of bed or even turn over without exacerbation of her condition. 183. On August 15, 2021, before the Vaccine Mandate removed religious exemptions, Nurse S. applied for a religious exemption from the employing hospital, based on the belief s enumerated above. Nurse S.'s request for religious exemption advised in particular that she could not take any of the available COVID -19 vaccines because of their connection to aborted fetal cell lines, citing the analysis of each vaccine by the Charlott e Lozier Institute. Nurse S. advised that \"is my Catholic duty to refuse the injection.\" 184. In addition to the medical concerns recited herein above, Nurse S. intends to have children, and she is aware that there is a lack of data on the effect of the availa ble COVID vaccines on pregnancy and post-partum development of children, given that the vaccines have been available for less than year. These medical facts inform Nurse S.'s religious conviction against involuntary vaccination. 206a 185. On September 1, 2021, Nurs e S. was advised by the hospital administration that due the Vaccine Mandate, as of August 26, 2021 the State will not permit exemptions for sincerely held religious beliefs, that \"we are required to comply with state law\" and that every member of the staf f must have at least one dose of a two -dose COVID vaccine, or a single dose vaccine by September 21, 2021. 186. Nurse S., who is just beginning her nursing career, now faces imminent termination of her employment and will be unemployable as a nurse anywhere in New York State due to the Vaccine Mandate, as well as possible license suspension or disciplinary proceedings due to termination for \"insubordination.\" 187. Nurse S. will thus suffer imminent irreparable harm to her occupation, reputation, and professional st anding in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Vaccine Mandate. Plaintiff \"Physician Liaison X.\" 188. Plaintiff X. (\"Physician Liaison X\"), who is Catholic, is a physician liaison manager for a major cancer center in the Southern District. Her job has been 100% remote for the past 18 months. 189. Last month, Physician Liaison X.'s employer began mandating COVID vaccinations for all employees, but with religious and medical exemptions allowed under the prior Health Order. That policy changed on September 1, 2021, when her employer announced by emai l that the Vaccine Mandate had eliminated all religious exemptions, that the employer could no longer grant religious exemptions, and that any religious exemptions granted would be revoked. 207a Physician Liaison X. is thus barred from obtaining the religious exemption she seeks, based on the religious beliefs enumerated above, which she holds in common with the other plaintiffs. 190. Physician Liaison X. now faces imminent loss of her employment and severe damage to her professional reputation and future employmen t in the extremely competitive sector of the medical executive class. 191. Physician Liaison X. will thus suffer imminent irreparable harm to her occupation, reputation, and professional standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of the V accine Mandate. COUNT I VIOLATION OF THE FREE EXERCISE CLAUSE OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983) 192. Plaintiffs hereby reallege and adopt each and every allegation in paragraphs 1 -191 above as if fully set forth here in. 193. The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, as applied to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits the State from abridging Plaintiffs' rights to free exercise of religion. 194. Plaintiffs have sincerely hel d religious beliefs that compel them to refuse vaccination with abortion -connected vaccines. 208a 195. Plaintiffs reallege the discussion of their sincerely held religious beliefs as set forth in all the preceding paragraphs. 196. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and a s applied, targets Plaintiffs' sincerely held religious beliefs by requiring the revocation of revoking religious exemptions previously granted by their employers or by prohibiting them from seeking and receiving exemption and accommodation for their since rely held religious beliefs from their employers, with the employers citing the Vaccine Mandate as the grounds for refusing even to consider exemption requests. 197. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, impermissibly burdens Plaintiffs' sincerely held religious beliefs, compels them to abandon their beliefs or violate them under coercion, and forces Plaintiffs to choose between their religious convictions and the State's patently unconstitutional value judgment that their religious beliefs are of no account and cannot be considered by employers. 198. The Vaccine Mandate strips Plaintiffs, adult medical professionals, of the right to religious exemption secured by state statute even for 17 -year- old college students, who can obtain an exemption by merely s ubmitting \"a written and signed statement from the student (parent or guardian of students less than 18 years of age) that he/she objects to immunization due to his/her religious beliefs.\" See Public Health Law \u00a7 2165, Immunization Requirements for Student s, https://tinyurl.com/4byd8s56. 209a 199. The Vaccine Mandate even eliminates the protection for religion and the allowance of religious exemptions under the prior Health Order, which was revised to exclude religious accommodation on or about August 26, 2021, only days ago. 200. The Vaccine Mandate, o n its face and as applied, places Plaintiffs in an irresolvable conflict between compliance with the mandate and their sincerely held religious beliefs. 201. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, puts substantial pressure on Plaintiffs to violate th eir sincerely held religious beliefs or face loss of their occupations, professional standing, licenses, reputations, and ability to support their families. 202. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, is neither neutral nor generally applicable as it grants the possibility of medical exemptions for reasons of secular \"health\" but bars religious exemptions according to the State's unconstitutional value judgment that physical health is less important than spiritual health. 203. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, thus targets Plaintiffs' religious beliefs for disparate and discriminatory treatment. 204. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, creates a system of individualized exemptions for preferred exemption requests based on physica l health, while discriminating against requests for exemption and accommodation based on sincerely held religious beliefs. 205. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, is a religious gerrymander that, only days 210a after promulgation of the Health Order allowing religious exemptions, excluded sincerely held religious beliefs from any form of accommodation while permitting state -favored medical exemptions. 206. There is no legitimate, rational, or compelling interest in t he Vaccine Mandate's exclusion of exemptions and accommodations for sincerely held religious beliefs, especially given the following facts: (a) those exempted for reasons of \"health\" are no less susceptible of contracting and spreading COVID (the preventio n of which is the very reason for the Vaccine Mandate) than those who would be exempted for reasons of religion (b) that the available COVID -19 vaccines are clearly failing to prevent transmission or infection, so that \"booster shots\" are now being promot ed; (c) even the vaccinated must continue to wear masks as if they were not vaccinated because they can still be infected or infect others ; (d) that naturally immune persons who have recovered from COVID have superior immunity and do not need vaccination; (e) that vaccinating naturally immune people may harm them by causing a hyperimmune response; and (f) that vaccinated persons are being admitted to the hospital along with unvaccinated persons. 207. The Vaccine Mandate is not the least restrictive means of ac hieving an otherwise permissible government interest, which could be achieved by the same protective measures (masking, testing, quarantining, etc.) already being required of the vaccinated and the unvaccinated alike (including those exempted for health r easons). 211a 208. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, has caused, is causing, and will continue to cause irreparable harm and actual and undue hardship to Plaintiffs from violation of their sincerely held religious beliefs and the occupational, profes sional, social and economic consequences pleaded above. 209. Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law to prevent the continuing violation of their constitutional liberties and sincerely held religious beliefs. COUNT II VIOLATION OF THE SUPREMACY CLAUSE OF TH E UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION (42 U.S.C. \u00b6 1983) 210. Plaintiffs hereby reallege and adopt each and every allegation in paragraphs 1 -209 as if fully set forth herein. 211. The Supremacy Clause provides: This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land ; and the Judges in every State shal l be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding. U.S. Const. Art. VI, cl. 22 (emphasis added). 212. The Vaccine Mandate, both facially and as applied, compels employers of health care workers in 212a the State of New York to disregard Title VII's protection against employment discrimination on account of religion, forbidding any accommodation of religious belief whatsoever and even requiring the revocation of previously granted religious exemptions from COVID v accination. 213. The Vaccine Mandate thus requires actions that federal law forbids, which renders the Vaccine Mandate null and void. Mutual Pharm. Co., Inc. v. Bartlett , 570 U.S. 472, 486 (2013). 214. All of Plaintiffs' employers have 15 or more employees and are subject to the requirements of Title VII. 215. By attempting to preclude application of Title VII in the State of New York in the case of COVID vaccination, the Vaccine Mandate patently violates the Supremacy Clause. 216. In particular, the Vaccine Mandate purpor ts to negate Title VII's requirement that employers provide reasonable accommodations to individuals with sincerely held religious beliefs, and even flatly prohibits religious exemption or accommodation requests, as the employers noted above have indicated . 217. By purporting to place themselves and their mandate outside the protections of both Title VII and the First Amendment, Defendants have violated the basic constitutional principle that \"federal law is as much the law of the several States as are the laws passed by their legislatures.\" Haywood v. Drown , 556 U.S. 729, 734 (2009) (emphasis added). 213a 218. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, has caused, is causing, and will continue to cause irreparable harm and actual and undue hardship to Plaintiffs f rom violation of their sincerely held religious beliefs and the occupational, professional, social and economic consequences pleaded above. 219. Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law for the continuing deprivation of their statutory rights under Title VII as secured by the Supremacy Clause. COUNT III VIOLATION OF THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983) 220. Plaintiffs hereby reallege and adopt each and every allegation in paragraphs 1 -209 above as if fully set forth herein. 221. The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees Plaintiffs' right to equal protection under the law. 222. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, is an unconstitutional abridgment of Plaintiffs' right to equal protection, is not neutral, and specifically targets Plaintiffs' sincerely held religious beliefs for discriminatory and unequal treatment as compared with the medical exemptions favored by the State's impermissible, anti -religious value judgment. 223. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, is an unconstitutional abridgement of Plaintiffs' right to equal protection because it permits the State to treat Plaintiffs differently from similarly 214a situated healthcare workers solely on the basis of Plaintiffs' sincerely held religious beliefs. 224. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, singles out Plaintiffs for selective treatment based upon their sincer ely held religious objections to the COVID -19 vaccines. 225. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, was clearly designed to slam shut what Defendants undoubtedly viewed as a large potential \"escape hatch\" from their planned regime of brute coercion t o be vaccinated under penalty of personal and professional destruction, which regime has no precedent in the history of the United States. This is shown by the Vaccine Mandate's abrupt excision of religious protection and religious accommodation from the prior Health Order, issued only days before. The intent is clearly to leave religious believers with no choice but to violate their religious beliefs to keep their jobs and avoid professional destruction and financial hardship. 226. The Vaccine Mandate, on it s face and as applied, creates a system of classes and categories that improperly accommodates exemptions for the class of healthcare workers concerned with bodily health while denying exemption to the class of health care workers concerned with spiritual health above bodily health, including all the Plaintiffs herein. 227. The Vaccine Mandate, reversing the State's policy of only days before, arbitrarily and capriciously attempts to deny Plaintiffs and others similarly situated the protection for religion and the requirement of religious accommodation under both the Human Rights Law of the State of New York and 215a the Human Rights Law of the City of New York, as well as the parallel the protections of Title VII, while leaving untouched protections under the same statutes for other protected classes, including by allowing exemptions for reasons of \"health\" but not religion. 228. The Vaccine Mandate arbitrarily and capriciously denies to adult medical workers with expert knowledge of vaccination and its risks the same religious exemption from vaccination available to any college student under Public Health Law \u00a7 2615, as pleaded above. 229. By purporting to negate statutorily required religious accommodations from consideration in the State of New York, Defendants, via the Va ccine Mandate, have singled out for disparate treatment the specific class of healthcare employees whose motive for seeking exemption from vaccination is religious rather than medical. 230. Further, Nurse J, Nurse N, Dr. P, and Dr. S have all previously had CO VID or COVID -like symptoms and, on information and belief, have natural immunity at a level no less than, and likely far more than, the immunity purportedly offered by available COVID vaccines. (See Exhibit E.) 231. There is no rational, legitimate, or compell ing interest in the Vaccine Mandate's application of different standards to different, similarly situated groups in the field of healthcare. 232. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, discriminates between religion and nonreligion by allowing nonrel igious exemptions to 216a the Vaccine Mandate while prohibiting religious exemptions. 233. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, is a \"status -based enactment divorced from any factual context\" and \"a classification of persons undertaken for its own sake, \" which \"the Equal Protection Clause does not permit.\" Romer v. Evans , 517 U.S. 620, 635 (1996). The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, \"identifies persons by a single trait [religious beliefs] and then denies them protections across the board.\" Id. at 633. 234. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, by allowing medical exemptions while denying religious exemptions, is a \"disqualification of a class of persons from the right to seek specific protection [for their religious beliefs].\" Id. 235. \"A law declarin g that in general it shall be more difficult for one group of citizens than for all others to seek [an exemption from the COVID -19 Vaccine Mandate] is itself a denial of equal protection of the laws in the most literal sense.\" Id. The Vaccine Mandate, on i ts face and as applied, is such a measure. 236. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, has caused, is causing, and will continue to cause irreparable harm and actual and undue hardship to Plaintiffs from violation of their sincerely held religious be liefs and the occupational, professional, social and economic consequences pleaded above. 237. Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law for the continuing deprivation of their rights under the Equal Protection Clause. 217a PRAYER FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE , Plaintiffs respectfully pray for relief as follows as to all Counts: (A). A statewide temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction, followed by a permanent injunction, restraining and enjoining the Defendants, their officers, agents, employ ees, attorneys and successors in office, and all other persons in active concert or participation with them, from enforcing, threatening to enforce, attempting to enforce, or otherwise requiring compliance with the Vaccine Mandate such that: (1) The Vaccine M andate is suspended in operation to the extent that the Department of Health is barred from enforcing any requirement that employers deny religious exemptions from COVID - 19 vaccination or that they revoke any exemptions employers already granted before the Vaccine Mandate superseded the prior Health Order to exclude religious exemptions, including the exemptions already granted to certain of the Plaintiffs herein; (2) The Department of Health is barred from interfering in any way with the granting of religious exemptions from COVID -19 vaccination going forward, or with the operation of exemptions already granted under the prior Health Order; (3) The Department of Health is barred from taking any action, disciplinary or otherwise, against the licensure, certifi cation, residency, admitting privileges or other professional status or qualification of any of the Plaintiffs on account of their seeking or having obtained a religious 218a exemption from mandatory COVID -19 vaccination. (B). A declaratory judgment declaring that the Vaccine Mandate, both on its face and as applied by Defendants, is unconstitutional, unlawful, and unenforceable in that: (1) the Vaccine Mandate violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment by depriving Plaintiffs and others similarly si tuated of the free exercise of religion under a measure that is neither neutral nor generally applicable but rather favors secular over religious reasons for exemption from COVID -19 vaccination and specifically targets for elimination the religious exempti ons provided only days earlier under the superseded Health Order; (2) the Vaccine Mandate violates the Supremacy Clause by purporting to strip Plaintiff and others similarly situated of statutory and constitutional protections for religion and religious accommodation under federal law; (3) the Vaccine Mandate violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by purporting to strip Plaintiffs and others similarly situated of state and federal statutory protection from discrimination in the matter of vaccination solely because of the religious grounds on which Plain tiffs seek protection. (C). An award of reasonable costs and expenses of this action, including a reasonable attorney's fee, in accordance with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988; and (D). Such other and further relief as the Court deems equitable and just under the circu mstances. 219a Dated: September 13, MMICHAEL G. MCHALE, ESQ.

Bassett, M.D., M.P.H. Kristen M. Proud, Acting Executive Deputy Commissioner Date: December 24, 2021 Advisory on Shortening Isolation Period for Certain Fully Vaccinated Healthcare Workers and Other Critical Workforce The information contained herein supersedes portions of previously issued Return to Work guidance for Healthcare Personnel and other prev ious guidance related to returning to work after SARS -CoV- 2 infection. Background On 12/23/2021, the CDC updated its guidance on isolation of healthcare workers ( Interim Guidance for Managing Healthcare Personnel with SARS- CoV- 2 Infection or Expo sure to SARS -CoV- 2 and Strategies to Mitigate Healthcare Personnel Staffing Shortages ). Given the very high case counts during the current COVID -19 surge in NYS, the Department expects a large number of mild or asymptomatic cases in fully vaccinated persons. Imposing a full 10 days of isolation in these circumstances has the potential to substantially impact critical services including healthcare, a sector already experiencing severe staffing shortages. In general, symptoms and duration of illness in SARS- CoV- 2 infections among fully vaccinated people are reduced compared with those who are unvaccinated ( CDC Science Brief: COVID -19 Vaccines and Vaccination ). At this time 222athere is limited evidence documenting viral dynamics of SARSCoV -2 Omicron variant infections among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals; however, the Department has reviewed data from other variants to help inform decision -making. For vaccine breakthrough infections including infections by the Delta variant, one study has reported the overall duration of infection among vaccine recipients is lower (5.5 days) as compared with unvaccinated cases (7.5 days) (Kissler et al). Therefore, given the extremely high vacc ination rate among NYS healthcare workers and the high rate in the population as a whole, the NYS guidance below applies to fully vaccinated staff. Guidance for return -to-work during isolation In limited circumstances where there is a critical staffing shortage, employers may allow a person to return to work after day 5 of their isolation period (where day zero is defined as either date of symptom onset if symptomatic, or date of collection of first positive test if asymptomatic) if they meet all the following criteria: The individual is a healthcare worker or other critical workforce member (see Appendix below). The individual is fully vaccinated (e.g. completed 1 dose of Janssen or 2 doses of an mRNA vaccine at least 2 weeks before the day they become symptomatic or, if asymptomatic, the day of collection of the first positive specimen). Complete information about who can be considered fully vaccinated (e.g. certain individuals vaccinated overseas or vaccinated as part of clinical trials) can be found at Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID -19 223aVaccines Currently Approved or Authorized in the United States . The individual is asymptomatic, or, if they had mild symptoms, when they return to work they must: o Not have a fever for at least 72 hours without fever- reducing medi cation o Have resolution of symptoms or, if still with residual symptoms, then all are improvin g o Not have rhinorrhea (runny nose) o Have no more than minimal, non- productive cough (i.e., not disruptive to work and does not stop the person from wearing their mask continuously, not coughing up phlegm) The individual is able to consistently and correctly wear a well -fitting face mask, a higherlevel mask such as a KN95, or a fit -tested N95 respirator while at work. The mask should fit with no air gaps around th e edges. o In the healthcare setting, if the individual wears a face mask rather than a respirator then it must be a well -fitting \"surgical\" face mask. o In other settings, face masks should be well - fitting, disposable, non -woven masks. Other face coverings including cloth masks are not allowed except as part of double masking with a disposable mask underneath. See https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 - ncov/your -health/effective- masks.html . 224a Individuals who are moderately to severely immunocompromised are not eligible to return to work under this guidance (see https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 - ncov/hcp/duration isolation.html ). For facilities; offices; and other essential healthcare settings (see Appendix) may allow their essential workers to participate. o The individual should be rest ricted from contact with severely immunocompromised patients (e.g., transplant, hematology - oncology, neonatal ICU). o A respirator or well -fitting surgical facemask should be worn even when the individual is in non-patient care areas such as breakrooms or offices. Individuals working under this policy must continue to stay at home, take precautions to avoid household transmission, and observe other required elements of isolation while not at work until the end of the 10 -day period. Testing is not required. Workers participating in this program should be instructed that: They should practice social distancing from coworkers at all times except when job duties do not permit such distancing. 225a If they must remove their respirator or well - fitting facemask, for example, in order to eat or drink, they should separate themselves from others. They should self -monitor for symptoms and seek re-evaluation from occupational health or their personal heal thcare provider if symptoms recur or worsen.
