Men and women adorned flowers and leaves not just as an ornament but also for the purpose of aromatherapy. According to Ayurvedic therapies, there are three modes Vyapasraya and Satvavajaya. Daiva Vyapasraya on divine power. This includes chanting mantras, observing fasts, performing fire sacrifices (Homa), and more. Yukti Vyapasraya is a treatment with medicines and lifestyle changes. Specific flowers are offered to specific deities and this varies according to the season. When one entered the premises of the [temple](https://www.indicasoftpower.com/divinity-in-fragrance/), the aromas imparted by the flowers, incense sticks, diyas (lamps), camphor, and the prasad (offering) are very healing in nature. This can make it seem like aromatherapy falls under Daiva Vyapasraya, however, it is actually mentioned in Yukti Vyapasraya. It is interesting to note that aromatherapy did not focus only on fragrance inhalation. Dried herbs in certain proportions were ground into a paste and applied on the body or on the wound area. For instance, sandalwood and rose paste. Unani school of medicine emphasised on therapeutics and palatability. This was why Unani medicine was very popular among the royals. Herbs with strong aromas along with their abundant healing properties played a role in therapeutics. There has been extensive research on aromatherapy and its impact on the neuroendocrine system. Inhalation of fragrances causes a change in the electroencephalogram. A particular fragrance or a blend of few scents can give rise to different types of brain waves. According to the waves, there is a change in the physiological functions. For instance, delta waves can cause a state of deep relaxation and sleep. Aromas ca be introduced to change the wave functioning. When there are more theta waves, the person is drowsier. If an aroma that can cause beta waves is introduced, the person becomes alert. This alertness is not just a physiological phenomenon but also a host of neuroendocrine changes that have taken place. In Ayurveda, specific fragrances have a direct correlation with the tridoshas. Ayurvedic scholars, Charaka and Vaghbhata have mentioned various aromas and their healing purposes in their books. One of the earliest mentions of using fragrances in Ayurveda can be found in the 13th chapter of the Sutrasthana in Ashtanga Hrudayam. It says, \"A person who has vitiated Pitta dosha, there are physiological changes in the body that affect metabolism and also the neuroendocrine system. To treat this imbalance, a phytochemical combination of herbs that are sweet, bitter, and astringent in taste. Apart from this, sweet-smelling fragrances that are cooling in nature, and are close to one's heart is used.\" Choosing a fragrance that is adored by the person makes the therapy more individualised. Apart from fragrances and their correlation with the tridoshas, fragrances are also season-specific. The science behind this is noteworthy.
