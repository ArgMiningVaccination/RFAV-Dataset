Abstract The prototypic costimulatory molecule CD28 is essential for proper CD4+ T cell activation and initiation of clonal expansion. CD28 ligation regulates metabolic adaptation, the production of cytokines, survival, differentiation but also T follicular helper cell generation and germinal center response. Moreover, CD28 signaling induces the expression of microRNA cluster miR-17~92 during CD4+ T cell activation. However, despite the importance of this receptor, the molecular understanding of how CD28 exerts its function remains incomplete. In this thesis, we extend previous reports by showing that miR-17~92 expression directly correlates with CD4+ T cell activation, and miR-17~92-deficiency phenocopies CD28-deficiency in mice. We therefore hypothesized that transgenic miR-17~92 expression could substitute for the loss of CD28. Using a B6.CD4cre.R26floxstopfloxmiR1792tg.CD28ko mouse model, we demonstrate that transgenic miR-17~92 expression compensates for CD28 expression during CD4+ T cell activation and differentiation in vitro, but also in vivo during acute LCMV infection. Even though many targets of miR-17~92 have been identified so far, the mechanisms by which miR-17~92 contributes to CD4+ T cell activation have not yet been fully explained. We generate transcriptomic datasets from activated CD4+ T cells with distinct amounts of miR-17~92 expression, with which we identify a new list of bona fide canonical miR-17~92 target genes. Furthermore, we demonstrate with a second dataset that these genes are not only regulated by miR-17~92 but also by CD28 expression. This shows that in addition to the activation of transcription during CD28 dependent CD4+ T cell activation, also the repression of genes which is mediated by miR-17~92 is essential. Moreover, the identified target genes mediate a rescue of the CD28ko transcriptome in rescue cells. We furthermore identify a new miR-17 target regulator of calcineurin 3 (RCAN3) among the list of target genes. Our data strongly support a model in which miR-17~92, in addition to known pathways like PI3K, also regulates the NFAT pathway. This qualifies this miRNA cluster as an important regulator of CD28 co-stimulation, which could have broad implications for a better understanding of T cell activation and immunotherapy. Introduction 9 3. Introduction 3.1. T cell activation 3.1.1. Activation needs co-stimulation The activation of CD4+ T cells is a cornerstone for a proper adaptive immune response. Only with the help of CD4+ T cells, B cells can undergo affinity maturation and class switch in order to reach an optimal antigen recognition and antibody response. Bretscher and Cohn proposed in 1970 that there are actually two signals needed in order to get full T cell activation [1], and this concept was further extended by Lafferty and Cunningham [2]. Schwartz and Jenkins later showed that T cell activation starts with binding of the T cell receptor (TCR) to an antigen presented on a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule, but without other signals, the cell may turn unresponsive and anergic [3, 4], suggesting that activation of T cells needs co-stimulatory signals. Co-stimulatory signals can either be generated from members of the CD28 family (which is the most important for T cells) or Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) receptor superfamily (for example CD40, which is more relevant for B cells). Early reports distinguished between TCR and CD28 signaling based on their differential reaction to Cyclosporin A (CsA), which on one hand led to the conclusion that TCR signaling is calcium (Ca2+) dependent, but secondly that CD28 has another, Ca2+ independent signaling mechanism that was not inhibited by CsA [5]. Later, several groups reported that CD28 can be and then binds to Phosphatidyl (PI3K) [6-8]. This binding of PI3K to CD28 is essential for downstream processes of T cell activation since it recruits the enzyme to the cell surface, providing proximity to target substrates which initiate pathways like glucose uptake, and cytoskeletal re-organization [9]. 3.1.2. T cell receptor signaling cascade The classical TCR is composed of an and a chain that span the cell membrane. Both of the chains have a variable and a constant region, and the combination of the extracellular variable regions is crucial for antigen specific binding. However, the Introduction 10 binding of antigen by / is not sufficient to initiate signaling. Instead, the TCR needs interaction partners for its function [10, 11], which then represent the starting point for further signaling: CD3 signaling chains as well as the -chains are associated with the - and chain, forming the TCR complex. The intracellular parts of these additional signaling chains bear so-called immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) which are important for downstream signaling [12]. The signaling processes are in fact a cascade of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events, which are tightly regulated and initiate recruitment and interaction of key molecules. During antigen recognition, the TCR recognizes the antigen that is presented on MHC. In the case of CD4+ T cells, the CD4 expressed on the T cell surface binds to the MHC class II molecule presenting the antigen to the TCR [13]. This binding moves the intracellular part of CD4 closer to the intracellular part of CD3, which is essential for the phosphorylation of ITAM: the Src-family kinase Lck is associated with CD4 and thought to be the main responsible kinase for the phosphorylation of ITAM (Figure 1) [14]. The activity of Lck is regulated by CD45, which can dephosphorylate both Lck phosphorylation Src kinase leads to of Lck [16], which is a catalytically inactive state. Figure 1. ITAMs of the T cell receptor complex are phosphorylated by Lck The TCR and chains bind to MHCII:antigen. CD4 binds to MHCII, bringing the associated Lck in closer proximity to the TCR complex, so that ITAMs as well as CD28 can be phosphorylated The phosphorylation of the ITAMs is the beginning of several downstream pathways: tandem Src Homology 2 (SH2) and SH3 domain-containing enzymes (e.g. ZAP70) recognize their binding motif, initiating further signaling. Once Lck has phosphorylated the ITAM on the intracellular part of CD3, ZAP70 binds to it and is as well phosphorylated by Lck [17]. This ZAP70 activation is the pre-requisite for subsequent T cell receptor signaling [18]: It phosphorylates the scaffold protein linker of activated Introduction 11 T cells (LAT) [19] and another adaptor protein called SLP-76. The two of them are linked by the adaptor protein Gads, which leads to a three-protein complex (LAT:Gads:SLP-76), which is key for T cell activation, acting as a scaffold. This scaffold can be generated by TCR signaling alone, while all subsequent events in T cell activation are dependent on co-stimulatory signals. ZAP70 activation additionally leads to the recruitment and activation of PI3K [20], but more importantly, PI3K is getting recruited and phosphorylated by the intracellular domain of CD28. CD28 is previously phosphorylated upon TCR signaling by p56Lck and p59Fyn [21] which enables binding of further molecules to this receptor. PI3K subsequently phosphorylates Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) resulting in Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), which is essential for many signaling molecules that bind to PIP3 via their PH domain (Figure 2). Figure 2. Phosphorylated ITAMs recruit SH2 domain containing molecules like ZAP70, so that a scaffold for further signaling can be created. Phosphorylated ITAMs are bound by SH2 domain-containing molecules like ZAP70, which in turn get activated and phosphorylated. This creates new binding- and phosphorylation sites for e.g. LAT and SLP-76, which are linked to a complex via Gads. PI3K is recruited to this complex as well as to the phosphorylated part of CD28, so that in PIP3. 3.1.3. Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase activity and other downstream effects of T cell activation Already in early reports from 1989, Thompson et al. described the augmentation of T cell responses, i.e. stronger cytokine production, if the stimulation of human T cells via CD3 complex was complemented with stimulation of CD28 [23]. The most important function of the co-stimulatory receptors is the enhancement of PI3K Introduction 12 expression [24]. The joint action of the LAT:Gads:SLP-76 scaffold and PI3K or both together initiate processes which are essential for proper T cell activation, starting from metabolic changes to cell adhesion, actin polymerization and alterations in transcription. Transcriptional changes initiated by TCR are mostly modulated by phospholipase C- (PLC-): PI3K phosphorylates PIP2 on the cell membrane which leads to PIP3, to which PLC- binds via its PH-domain. PLC- then binds to the LAT:GADS:SLP-76 complex, and is phosphorylated by Itk (IL-2 inducible T cell kinase, which is recruited to the membrane via its PH domain binding to PIP3). Phosphorylated PLC- can then break down PIP2 into diacylglycerol (DAG), which will stay bound to the membrane, and a diffusible second messenger called inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) [25]. These two cleavage products initiate (Figure 3). Figure 3. PLC- cleaves and DAG, both leading to transcriptional changes. Other molecules like ADAP can also bind to the scaffold, initiating other downstream mechanisms, in this case increased integrin adhesion. DAG recruits other molecules to the membrane, like PKC and RasGRP. RasGRP activates Ras [26], which is an of the MAPK pathway leading to Erk1 expression [27], which promotes generation of activator protein 1 (AP-1). AP-1 is a heterodimer consisting of Fos and Jun which is transcriptionally until thereby activates AP-1 and initiates the transcription of many genes that are essential for T cell activation. AP-1 is an important interaction partner of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). PKC is also recruited to the membrane by DAG, promoting a pathway which results in the activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFB) [29]. Introduction 13 TCR stimulation furthermore leads to increased integrin adhesion [30]. This process is mediated by the LAT:GADS:SLP-76 complex as well: the adaptor protein ADAP is recruited to the complex, which recruits two more proteins SKAP55 and RIAM. This complex in turn activates a small Rap1 which promotes LFA-1 its conformational change [32]. In this state, LFA-1 has a higher affinity for ICAM-1, which is important for the T cell if it should extravasate from e.g. a blood vessel to the surrounding tissue. For a stable interaction between the antigen presenting cell (APC) and the T cell, which is essential for the proper activation of the T cell, the cytoskeleton has to reorganize [33]. This process depends on Vav, which is recruited to PIP3 via its PH domain. At the same time, it also interacts with the LAT:GADS:SLP-76 complex via its SH2 domain. Also WASp is recruited to the LAT:GADS:SLP-76 complex, binding via the adaptor protein Nck. Vav activates Cdc42, which induces a conformational change in WASp [34]. This binds to WIP, and the complex recruits Arp2 and 3, which induces actin polymerization. The PI3K is also especially important for the metabolic changes underlying T cell activation [35, 36]. Protein kinase B, also known as Akt [37], binds to PIP3 in the membrane, where it is phosphorylated by PDK1. Phosphorylated Akt initiates a couple of important downstream pathways, for example it promotes the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway [38], leading to metabolic changes (Figure 4). Figure 4. PIP3 is an important interaction partner for different pathways of T cell activation PIP3 interacts with Vav, activation and PIP3 activates Akt, leading to mTOR pathway activation. PLC- importance is shown in Figure 3. All of these processes that are partially or fully dependent on the activity of PI3K already argue for the importance of co-stimulation in the T cell activation process. We will now go into detail on the downstream mechanism of IP3, which will be of particular interest in this thesis. PIPPLCmTORpathwayAktVavcleavage of PIPactinpolymerizationIntroduction 14 3.1.4. IP3 initiates Store Operated Calcium binds to Ca2+ channels in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, so that Ca2+ is released from the ER store [39, 40], leading to an acute drop of Ca2+ abundance inside the ER lumen. This induces a conformational change [41] and clustering of stromal interaction molecules (STIM1/2) within the ER membrane [42, 43]. The STIM molecules then interact with the plasma membrane and ORAI [44, 45], which belong to the family of Ca2+-release activated Ca2+ channels (CRAC). The concentration of intracellular Ca2+ is mainly controlled by CRAC channels, in T cells ORAI1/2 [42, 46-48], which are located in the plasma membrane. The CRAC channels open upon interaction with STIM1/2 [44], which allows extracellular Ca2+ influx and activation of further signaling to replenish Ca2+ stores in the ER. Since the Ca2+ concentration of the ER regulates the Ca2+ influx, this process is called store operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) [40, 49, 50]. The Ca2+ in the cytosol bind to calmodulin, changing its conformation so that it interacts with and activates calcineurin. Upon conformational change of calmodulin activation NFAT is de-phosphorylated in multiple serine and threonine residues in its regulatory domains and translocates to the nucleus [51] where it initiates transcriptional activation (Figure 5). Figure 5. IP3 induces Store Operated Calcium Entry (SOCE) IP3 interacts with ER calcium channels, so that Ca2+ is released from ER Ca2+ stores. STIM1/2 sense this drop in Ca2+ within the ER, and interact with ORAI1/2 to initiate extracellular Ca2+ influx. Ca2+ binds to calmodulin, leading to a change and interaction with calcineurin. Calcineurin then de-phosphorylates NFAT, enabling nuclear translocation. Introduction 15 The phosphatase activity of calcineurin can be blocked by CsA and FK506 (also known as Tacrolimus) in a calmodulin independent manner [52, 53], which is one important aspect of immunosuppressive medication that is used in the clinics [54]. Mice that are deficient in ORAI1/2 or STIM1/2 expression in T cells display impaired T cell mediated immune responses, marked by impaired cytokine production and antigen-dependent proliferation [47, 55, 56]. Also for humans, mutations of ORAI and STIM result in severe combined immunodeficiency [46], underlining the importance of this pathway for proper T cell activation and function. 3.1.5. NFAT and its targets NFAT was found in the end of the 1980s in the extract of activated T cells and several cell lines [57]. Shaw et al. described \"an inducible DNA-binding factor that is expressed minutes before the activation of the interleukin 2 (IL-2) gene\". NFAT was found not only in the cytoplasm but also in the nuclear fraction of stimulated Jurkat cells [58], with a different sensitivity to inhibition by FK506 and CsA, indicating that the translocation to the nucleus must be regulated by calcineurin. Meanwhile, the importance of the NFAT family was also demonstrated in other cell types of the hematopoietic system like megakaryocytes [59], dendritic cells [60] and B cells [61] as well as for developmental processes [62] and in other tissues, for example pancreatic cells [63] and osteoclasts [64]. The them is expressed in a different tissue-specific pattern and none is restricted to lymphocytes in its expression [66]. All of the family members are evolutionary related to the Rel-nuclear-factor-B family of transcription factors (TF), but only NFAT1-4 are regulated by intracellular Ca2+ abundance via calcineurin [69]. In T cells, three of the Ca2+ regulated NFAT family members are expressed in two splice forms: NFATc1, NFATc2 and NFATc3 [68, 70]. All essential domains: First of all, the NFAT homology region that contains interaction domains for calcineurin (TAD-A, transactivation domain) and NFAT kinases (regulatory domain, phosphorylated such as dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation regulated kinase 1, DYRK1). This region is also strongly Introduction 16 targeted and thereby de-phosphorylated by calcineurin [53, 71, 72] in order to permit nuclear localization [57, 73]: for example NFATc2 is heavily phosphorylated on 14 sites, and 13 of them can be de-phosphorylated by calcineurin [74]. Secondly, the Rel homology region harbors the DNA-binding domain of the protein [75, 76] via a DNA-binding loop that also confers base-specific recognition at its N-terminal region, but also has a protein interaction domain at its C-terminus. This protein interaction domain is of special importance regarding the targets of the NFAT family: the diversity of interaction partners enable NFAT to act on a variety of different pathways, which are essential for T cell activation and differentiation. NFAT can have an activating or deactivating transcriptional function depending on its binding partners [68]. For the initiation of transcription, NFAT needs to form a complex with AP-1, MEF2, or GATA proteins. The most commonly known interaction partner of NFAT is AP-1 [28, 77]. This interaction can [79], interferon gamma (IFN) [80], [82] or Forkhead box p3 (FoxP3) is when NFAT interacts with AP-1 to form a heterodimer that binds DNA [28, 75, 77, 84]. However, addition of exogenous IL-2 only poorly rescues in vitro proliferation capacity of CD4cre.ORAI2fl/fl murine CD4+ T cells [47] which argues that cytokines are not the exclusive NFAT downstream targets that strongly influence proliferation. Moreover, the regulation of IL-2 is a good example of how complex the regulation actually might be: NFAT-AP1 promotes IL-2 transcription, whereas NFAT-Foxp3 actually represses [85]. Furthermore, additional factors like runt-related TFs (Runx1 and 3) regulate NFAT-induced IL-2 transcription as well. Other binding partners of NFAT have also been described to initiate transcription: upon interaction with C/EBP, binding to the PPAR- promoter is promoted [86], subsequent binding of NFAT to PPAR- then leads to binding of the IL-2 promoter while blocking the DNA binding of NFAT, thereby inhibiting IL-2 transcription leads to binding in IL-4 promoter or enhancer regions. Upon interaction with T box expressed by T cells (Tbet), NFAT binds to the 5' enhancer of TNF EGR1 interact with NFAT [92], and synergy with MEF2 recruits the coactivator p300 for the transcription of Nur77 [93]. During early T cell activation, Introduction 17 NFAT actually binds both promoters of IFN and IL-4 [94], and as soon as T cell differentiation has been initiated the inappropriate locus is silenced. Besides effects on cytokine production, NFAT mediates metabolic reprogramming NFAT induce glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation by regulating the expression of glucose transporters, glycolytic and mitochondrial enzymes. However, they also show that these pathways do not entirely depend on NFAT and that also the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway is to some extent regulated by SOCE and calcineurin. Ca2+ signaling can have a stimulatory but also an inhibitory role in gene expression [96]. Feske et al. performed gene expression analysis on two T cell lines from patients with defects in Ca2+ signaling and found that about a third of the genes were down-regulated in the control, but not in patient samples upon activation, among these they identified Lck, Fas, E2F-3, IRF-2 and Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). Sustained Ca2+ signaling induced by TCR in the absence of co-stimulation induces a state of anergy in B and T cells [97-99], in the latter this is marked by the expression of anergy-associated genes like GRAIL which negatively regulates T cell activation signals by targeting them for degradation. NFATc2 knockout cells were shown to be more resistant to anergy induction than wild-type cells and T cell anergy was induced in the absence of AP-1 [97], underlining critical role in anergy NFAT One downstream effect of CD28 co-stimulation is that Akt [100] is activated via kinase that re-phosphorylates NFAT and thereby mediates nuclear export, but upon Akt activity GSK3 is phosphorylated which inhibits its kinase activity [105, 106]. Thereby, CD28 indirectly promotes NFAT signaling via PI3K signaling and the prevention of its export to cytoplasm [106, 107]. Calcineurin is regulated [108], AKAP79 [109, and members of the Down's (DSCR, also called regulator of calcineurin (RCAN) [111, 112]. In mice that are deficient for Cabin1, Introduction 18 Esau et al. reported increased cytokine expression in stimulated T cells [113], demonstrating the negative regulation of calcineurin by calcipressins. There are three regulators of calcineurin (RCAN1-3) described in humans. They bind and inhibit the activity of calcineurin via the CIC motif [112], thereby preventing the dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NFAT [114]. The RCAN molecules differ in their N-terminal region, but are conserved among their central and C-terminal regions [112]. Expression of RCAN3 was reported in peripheral blood leukocytes, heart, skeletal muscle, liver and kidney [115]. However, in murine T cells mostly RCAN3 is expressed while RCAN2 is barely detectable and RCAN1 shows low expression (Figure 6) ([116], http://rstats.immgen.org/Skyline/skyline.html). Skylines of RCAN1, RCAN2, murine T cells Normalized expression value of RCAN1-3 are shown in distinct T cell subsets. Introduction 19 3.1.7. Differentiation of CD4+ T cells We can experimentally determine the activation state of a CD4+ T cell by staining for early (e.g. CD25, also known as IL-2R), and CD69 [117] and late (e.g. CD44/CD62L [118]) activation markers. Furthermore, activated CD4+ T cells are expected to blast, proliferate and produce cytokines, typically IL-2, in a CD28 dependent manner as described in previous sections. When activated in the presence of different cytokines, as it is typically the case in different types of infection, CD4+ T cells differentiate into different T Helper (TH) cell subsets. The decision to differentiate into a certain TH subset is mainly initiated by the surrounding of the CD4+ T cell: the antigen, the type of cell that presents it and also the presence of cytokines (that can be released provided by cells of the innate immune system as well) act in concert to drive a specific type of differentiation. However, after the initiation of the process there are multiple feedback mechanisms inside the cell that emphasize the signal, leading to commitment. Among them are epigenetic changes and locus availability [119, 120], which is of major importance also for NFAT activity (see section 3.1.5). This can also be simulated to some extent in vitro by the addition of cytokines and blocking antibodies during the activation process. The individual T follicular Helper (TFH), TH1, TH2, TH17, and regulatory T (Treg) cells are characterized by the expression of different subset specific hallmark TFs and cytokines (Figure 7). Figure 7. Classical view of T helper populations (Figure taken from [121]) Introduction 20 In this thesis, TFH and TH1 cells are of particular interest. TH1 cells are an important part of intracellular pathogen immunity, because they are able to activate macrophages [122] e.g. by the secretion of IFN. TH1 are defined by the expression of the hallmark TF Tbet [123], which actively suppresses TH2 fate and induces production of IFN. This phenomenon is restricted to CD4+ T cells: CD8+ T cells can produce IFN T-bet [125], which STAT5 signaling coming from IL-2R. Tbet then promotes IFN production [123]. When TCR signaling stops, IL12R2 is induced [126], so that IL-12 can promote STAT4 signaling [127], which additionally promotes IFN and enhances STAT1 signaling. This illustrates how NFAT as a part of a positive feedback loop is essential for the differentiation of a TH cell subset, in this case TH1, but also in TH2 and TH17 similar synergistic action of sequential processes have been described [128]. The interaction between TFH providing specialized help to B cells is essential for the formation of germinal centers (GC) [129]. These are histologically distinct structures within the B cell follicles of secondary lymphoid organs, and the main place where B cell affinity maturation and class switch recombination occur. TFH are characterized by the expression of their master regulatory factor Bcl-6 [130], and further characterized by the expression of CXCR5, programmed death 1 (PD-1), the differentiation helper lineages [130], but it also modulates microRNA (miRNA) expression [133]. TFH are dependent on the global expression of miRNA (see section 3.2), which was shown in mice with CD4 intrinsic deficiency for DGCR8: the differentiation and function of TFH was severely reduced [134]. Even though more and more evidence accumulates of which signals are needed for Bcl-6 induction and TFH differentiation, i.e. IL-21 and IL-6 [131], TFH so far cannot be generated in vitro. However, there are well established viral models (like acute lymphocytic choriomengitis model virus (LCMV), Armstrong [135]) to address the differentiation of this T cell subset in vivo, such models will also be applied in this thesis. Introduction 21 3.1.8. CD28 3.1.8.1. The family of CD28 The so-called receptor family of CD28 is grouped by their similar structure. All of the family members are expressed on lymphocytes and bind B-7 family ligands. Their role can be divided into activating and inhibitory molecules [136]. Expression of each of those molecules depends on context, activation state and cell type as well as on the presence of cytokines [137]. Moreover, the peptide affinity of the TCR complex to the antigen decides about the amount of co-stimulatory signals, which has led to some confounding results in different studies [137]. The net result of cell activation with co-stimulation is finally a complex combination of overlapping and opposing signals, which will only be briefly described here. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and PD-1 are typical examples for inhibitory receptors of the CD28 family. T cells from CTLA-4 deficient mice are hyper responsive to antigen [138, 139], and show increased TFH and GC B cell differentiation in a CD28 dependent manner [140]. CTLA-4-Ig is a widely used tool to study co-stimulation: upon application of CTLA-4 antibodies, TCR and TCR/CD28 triggered proliferation is inhibited [141] and T cell dependent antibody responses are strongly reduced [142]. PD-1 binds its ligand PD-L1 [143], and signals via this pathway regulate initial activation, which represents an important aspect of immune regulation [144]. Mice that are deficient for this receptor develop lupus-like symptoms and splenomegaly [145]. On the other hand, expression of PD-1 is elevated in some cancer and chronic viral infections, which led to the development of the PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade therapy [146]. In this approach, PD-1 signaling is blocked in order promote immunity to cancer. Lately, it was shown that this therapy might depend on the activating signaling via CD28 [147, 148]. ICOS and CD28 are activating receptors. The expression of ICOS is only induced via independent signaling pathways NFAT or MEK-ERK during CD4+ T cell activation [149], while CD28 is expressed on na\u00efve as well as activated cells. Weber et al. showed that while ICOS is dispensable for early events in TFH differentiation like the upregulation of Bcl-6, it is essential for late GC reactions [150]. However, CD28 regulates key events in early TFH generation but is dispensable for maintenance of TFH cells. Interestingly, Introduction 22 the reduced GC response known from CD28 deficient mice is similarly seen in ICOS deficient patients [151]. Overall, the family of CD28 receptors is very diverse, some of the function is redundant yet the expression of each receptor is timing- and context dependent. Moreover, receptors of opposing role can be competing for the same ligand: CD28 and CTLA-4 both bind to the same receptors B7.1 and B7.2 (also called CD80 and CD86) [152], whereas CTLA-4 binds with a higher affinity. In this thesis, we will focus on CD28 in early CD4+ T cell activation. 3.1.8.2. Structure and important motifs of CD28 CD28 is expressed on na\u00efve CD4+ T cells and binds to B7.1 (CD80) and B7.2 (CD86) which are expressed on APCs. When CD28 is bound to its ligand, the cytoplasmic part is phosphorylated by Lck. Different motifs of the intracellular part have been described to be essential for different functions. Of note, since the structure of the intracellular part of CD28 is very similar to CTLA-4 and ICOS, some of the motifs are shared between these domains as illustrated in Figure 8. Figure 8. Motifs in the cytoplasmic tail of CD28 are partially shared with other family members (figure taken from [137]) The tyrosine residues in a YXN motif can recruit the adaptor protein Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) via a non-ITAM motif YXXM. This is a shared motif between CD28, ICOS and CTLA-4, which acts as a consensus binding site for the p85 subunit of PI3K. More specifically, in CD28 this motif is YMNM. The asparagine residue confers specificity for Grb2 and Gads (see section 3.1), which might account for differences in the signaling between ICOS, CTLA-4 and CD28 [137, 153]. Introduction 23 The motif PXXP was shown to bind the SH3 domains of Lck and Itk. It is essential for the signaling leading to normal IL-2 secretion as well as for the downstream phosphorylation of key kinases like PDK1, GSK3 and PKC. Mutation of this distal motif led to decreased proliferation and IL-2 production, while mutation of the proximal YMNM motif was phenotypically indifferent [154]. Actually, the importance of the YMNM motif is a matter of debate, since others reported inhibition of proliferation and IL-2 secretion [155] in the same mouse model. In humans, recurrent mutations in CD28 were reported for peripheral T cell lymphomas. Some of these mutations led to an increase of the affinity for CD86, GRB2 and GADS/GRAP2 with consequently increased NFB signaling in response to CD28 stimulation [156]. 3.1.8.3. The role of CD28 in CD4+ T cell differentiation Studies with CD28 deficient mice have been reported since 1993. In the first publication from Shahinian et al., CD28 deficient mice were shown to have normal numbers in B and T cells but reduced serum immunoglobulin (Ig) for the subclasses IgG1, IgG2b and a slight reduction in IgG3 [157]. In the meantime, many other and more specific cell subsets were investigated: CD28 was shown to be essential for the generation of TFH cells and GC B cells [158]. The dominant ligand for this differentiation to TFH is CD86 [140]. Apart from priming, maintained CD28 stimulation is also required for the differentiation and maintenance of TH1 as well as TFH cells during response to viral infection, and for the clearance of Citrobacter rodentium from the gastrointestinal tract [159]. As for TH2 differentiation, King et al. reported in 1996 that CD28 deficient mice generate reduced IL-4 and IL-5 production in a Schistosoma mansoni infection [160]. In their study, they concluded that early CD28 signaling during CD4+ T cell priming was required for the generation of a TH2 response. Treg cell populations are reduced in CD28 deficient mice in blood, spleen and lymph nodes. Moreover, na\u00efve CD28ko CD4+ T cells show reduced de novo Treg differentiation potential in vivo and in vitro, which can be rescued by addition of exogenous IL-2 [161]. This might actually explain part of the Treg phenotype, because CD28 was shown to regulate IL-2 production in two different pathways: on one hand it stabilizes the mRNA Introduction 24 of IL-2, and on the other the activation of PI3K with subsequent nuclear localization of NFAT leads to more IL-2 transcription [162]. FoxP3creCD28fl/fl mice have normal populations of Tregs but show highly activated effector cells, leading to lethal autoimmunity as of 8-12 weeks of age. Addition of exogenous IL-2 could rescue for the proliferation defect of CD28 deficient Tregs in vitro, nevertheless these Tregs still showed competitive disadvantage in vivo and were less suppressive as compared to wild type (wt) cells [163]. Furthermore, it was shown that CD28 expression during Treg maturation is essential for the generation of CD44hiCD62Llo effector Tregs and the induction of CCR6 expression. The deficiency of CCR6 expression when CD28 was absent led to a defect in skin homing, which was partially responsible for skin inflammation in this mouse model [164]. The only subset in which CD28 co-stimulation was shown to have inhibitory effects was TH17 differentiation. Bouguermouh et al. reported that CD28 co-stimulation reduced TH17 polarization in comparison to CD3 stimulus alone [165]. They then neutralized IL-2 and IFN with blocking antibodies and found that this restores IL-17A production even in the presence of CD28 co-stimulation, which might suggest that TH1 response is favored by CD28 co-stimulation. In summary, CD28 co-stimulation contributes to the polarization of different TH subsets, however different mechanisms might come into play here and suggest a complex network of differentiation. 3.1.8.4. CD28 and metabolism Na\u00efve CD4+ T cells only show low activity of genes that are involved in glycolysis, glutaminolysis and lipid biosynthesis. They efficiently generate ATP via glycolysis, during which glucose is metabolized to pyruvate. However, since the metabolic need in na\u00efve cells is quite low, they also only take up low amounts of glucose [166]. Upon activation, rapid transcriptional activation of genes is initiated and essential to meet the needs for cell growth and differentiation [167, 168]. For example, as soon as the T cell gets activated, glucose intake is greatly increased in CD28 dependent manner [37]. This is mainly regulated by glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), whose expression is low in na\u00efve but upregulated in activated T cells [169]. Increasing glucose uptake by transgenic expression of GLUT1 also leads to more activation, which suggests glucose Introduction 25 as a limiting factor in activation [170]. The pyruvate that is generated via glycolysis is further metabolized in aerobic glycolysis, which leads to lactate production, or in oxidative phosphorylation. Activated and differentiated T cells can use various pathways for their energetic supply [171, 172] and rewiring of metabolic pathways upon T cell activation is regulated by distinct pathways depending on the T cell subset. For example, activation of Akt (see section 3.1.3) leads to GLUT1 upregulation [169] and consequently more glucose uptake, while ERK activation increases glutamine uptake [174]. Especially important for the initial reprogramming of metabolism in T cells are the TF c-Myc and mTORC1. mTORC1 maintains the high expression of c-Myc, which binds to promotors of glycolytic genes to induce gene expression [171, 175]. Another important TF is hypoxia induced factor 1 HIF1 drives TH17 differentiation and sustains elevated glycolysis [176] prevents Treg generation [177]. Together with binds hypoxia responsive element sequences and activates transcriptional programs that help the cell to adapt to lower oxygen availability. Upon CD28 co-stimulation, HIF1 protein is upregulated, presumably through PI3K and mTOR activity [178-180]. Introduction 26 3.2. Gene regulation through microRNAs 3.2.1. Posttranscriptional regulation and microRNAs A wide range of mechanisms have been established that may regulate the expression of a gene or protein. Regarding mechanisms involving RNA, we distinguish between transcriptional regulation (e.g. initiation of transcription), which refers to the regulation of the DNA to RNA transcription, and post-transcriptional regulation, which focuses on the regulation that acts directly on RNA. Posttranscriptional regulation includes all sorts of different mRNA modifications which lead to e.g. stabilization, storage or decay. In this thesis, we are especially interested in the effects of miRNAs. MiRNAs are usually 22nt in length and were shown to have essential roles in animals [181] as well as plants [182]. They can be encoded in a host gene but also in an intron [183], often in polycistronic miRNA \"clusters\", so that multiple miRNAs are generated from one transcript [184]. However, this does not necessarily mean that all members of the same cluster are expressed to the same extent, since post-transcriptional mechanisms can introduce an additional regulation also for miRNAs [184, 185]. A potentially important role for miRNAs was suggested by Blevins et al. in 2015: they reported that the absence of miRNA in lymphocytes led to more variation in protein expression within a population of cells [186]. In feed forward loops, the target gene (e.g. CD69) and the targeting miRNA (miR-17 and miR-20a) are expressed simultaneously, which reduces cell to cell variation. Additionally, single cell studies show that the effect of repression can actually be very striking [187]. Mukherji et al. suggested that miRNAs introduce a threshold of target mRNA expression [187], and at this threshold great sensitivity of regulation is reached. This means that miRNAs not only can fine-tune gene expression, but also act as switches if the target mRNA is expressed at threshold levels. 3.2.2. MicroRNA biogenesis Transcription of the miRNA results in a long primary transcript (pri-miRNA) [188] which is capped and polyadenylated [189]. This primary transcript is processed in the nucleus by key enzymes Drosha and DGCR8 into 60-70nt pieces (pre-miRNA) [190], including a stem loop. The pre-miRNA is exported to the cytosol where it is further Introduction 27 processed by an RNAseIII endonuclease called Dicer into double stranded RNA duplices: the miRNA and its antisense strand [191] (Figure 9). Figure 9. Canonical pathway of miRNA biogenesis (figure taken from [192]) The mature miRNA then forms an RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) with several proteins, for example Argonaute 2 (Ago2). RISC is guided by the miRNA to its targeting sequence. The major determining factor of this is the seed region of the miRNA: a 6-8nt sequence at the 5' end of the miRNA [182, 193]. Upon targeting of the mRNA, the protein expression is usually down regulated by mRNA decay or mRNA deadenylation [194-196]. Of note, one 3' untranslated region (UTR) can be targeted by more than one miRNA, which is also supported by bioinformatics predictions [197], and vice versa one miRNA family can have hundreds of targets [198]. Notably, mRNA targeting at the 3'UTR via Watson-Crick base pairing is some sort of a classical, straight-forward understanding of targets (canonical targets). Further targeting sites like the 5' end [199] of an mRNA or even non-protein coding transcripts [200] were reported. Additionally, seed-matched base pairing as a pre-requisite for miRNA function was challenged by reports about G:U wobbles and bulges in the seed region, leading to inexact pairing but preserved function [201, 202]. This introduced \"non-canonical\" targets to the field, which do not harbor the seed sequence of the targeting miRNA. As for nomenclature, the field distinguishes between the same miRNA generated from different loci with numbering (e.g. miR-125b-1 and miR-125b-2). Moreover, we distinguish the sense and the antisense strand of the generated miRNA duplex, resulting in two miRNAs, a 5' and a 3' strand version (miR-17-5p and miR-17-3p). Importantly, which one finally is the more abundant (\"guide\" strand) and which one is less biologically active (\"passenger\" strand, also known as miRNA*) [203] is thought Introduction 28 to be determined by thermodynamic stability and Ago preference. Usually, the guide with the less stable 5' terminus is selected as the guide strand, but also Ago proteins prefer guides with a U as a starting nucleotide [204]. The miRNA biogenesis pathway described above explains the canonical pathway of miRNA biogenesis. Notably, also alternative mechanisms have been described, which are Dicer- or Drosha-independent [205, 206]. However, these non-canonical miRNAs only represent approximately 1% of the miRNAs and their functional relevance is unclear [203]. Posttranscriptional regulation by miRNAs was reported for approximately half of all protein-encoding genes [198]. It is of note that additional layers of regulation add even more complexity to the system: miRNA clusters are processed, resulting in differential expression for each cluster members [207, 208]. This suggests that actually miRNAs of the same cluster can play a role in different functions, at different time points, in different cell types, depending on their context. Interfering with the miRNA biogenesis pathway has severe impacts on the immune system, which is was shown in several mouse models: deletion of Dicer [209] or Drosha [210] in a CD4cre-system led to multiorgan inflammatory syndrome which was most likely due to dysfunctional Treg cells. Deletion of Dicer in immature thymocytes caused a severe reduction in double positive CD4+CD8+ and CD4+ or CD8+ single positive cells in the thymus as well as to a reduction in T cells in the periphery [209, 211]. Muljo et al. showed that T cells deficient for Dicer are biased towards TH1 differentiation [212] due to their failure to suppress IFN production. The deletion of Dicer additionally also led to a reduced Treg cell population, which then led to severe immunopathology [209] with splenomegaly, colitis and enlarged intestinal lymph nodes. When Dicer expression is ablated in Treg cells only, the mice develop a fatal systemic autoimmune disease due to loss of their suppressive capacity [213]. DGCR8 deficiency in Treg cells also led to a scurfy-like phenotype and unstable Foxp3 expression [214], supporting the concept that canonical miRNA expression is essential for functional Treg control. Introduction 29 3.2.3. miR-17~92 While there is an overall massive increase in RNA transcription upon T cell activation, miRNA expression is globally down regulated within 12h of activation [84]. Moreover, within two days post activation the majority of all miRNA is downregulated in murine as well as human primary CD4+ T cells. Further examination of key enzymes of the miRNA generation pathway showed that the expression of Ago2 was reduced, leading to a stop in miRNA processing [84]. One miRNA cluster breaking with this pattern is the expression of miR-17~92, which is induced during CD4+ T mice, the miR-17~92 cluster, also known as oncomir-1 or chromosome 13 open reading frame 25 (C13orf25) [217], is encoded in the non-protein coding miR-17~92 host gene (MIR17HG) on chromosome 14. Expression of miR-17~92 was shown from early developmental stages to adult cells in different kinds of tissue, in variable amounts [218, 219]. The cluster codes miR-20a, miR-19b, and miR-92) that can grouped regarding their four seed families (miR-17 family, miR-18 family, miR-19 family and miR-92 family) as illustrated in Figure 10. The cluster is highly conserved among vertebrates [184], and duplication events during evolution led to the development of two paralogue clusters miR-106a363 cluster on the X and miR-106b25 cluster on the fifth chromosome, which also give rise to individual miRNAs that can be grouped to the same seed families, so that from miR-17~92 and its paralogs, 15 adult miRNAs are generated [220]. Figure 10. miR-17~92, its paralogue clusters and grouping of seed families (figure taken from [218]) A) illustrates the three paralogue clusters while B) shows the grouping of the different miRNAs of each cluster according to their common seed sequence Introduction 30 Germline knockout of miR-106a363 or miR-106b25 in mice was phenotypically indifferent while miR-17~92 knockout led to smaller size and perinatal lethality [218]. The combination of a knockout of miR-106b25 with a knockout of miR-17~92 led to an even more severe phenotype, which suggests that miR-17~92 can compensate for the loss of miR-106b25 and that homologous miRNA clusters that display similar expression patterns can be functionally redundant [221]. Furthermore, it was reported that there is functional cooperation between members of the miR-17~92 cluster [222]. 3.2.3.2. miR-17~92 as an oncogene The expression of miR-17~92 is known to be elevated in solid tumors and hematopoietic malignancies, e.g. in B cell lymphomas [217, 223]. Retroviral expression of miR-17~92 in a mouse B cell lymphoma model led to increased c-Myc expression and tumor formation [223]. Genetic ablation of the cluster in Myc-driven lymphomas reduces tumor cell growth [224]. This demonstrates the potential oncogenic role of miRNAs, especially miR-17~92, in vivo, which is also the reason why miR-17~92 is sometimes named oncomiR-1. Also vice versa, Myc induces miR-17~92 [225], and with this influences metabolism in Myc lymphoma cells [226]. In this publication, Izreig et al. show that miR-17 and miR-20 are especially important for this miR-17~92 dependent reprogramming. miR-17 targets the tumor suppressor LKB1, which regulates metabolism and cell growth through mTOR signaling [226]. However, the authors also suggest that since the effects on metabolic reprogramming by miR-17~92 are rather large, it might be that not individual metabolic genes but TFs are targeted by the miRNA cluster. 3.2.3.3. Known miR-17~92 targets in CD4+ T cells With the increasing amount of literature on miR-17~92, many roles for the expression of miR-17~92 and its targets have been reported [227, 228]. The ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) project provided some information on transcriptional regulation: this study with 118 TFs revealed 34 that were connected to the miR-17~92 cluster [229]. All E2Fs were shown to bind to the promoter region of miR-17~92, but in turn they are as well known to be regulated by the cluster [230], which is a good example for the action of miRNAs in autoregulatory loops. Introduction 31 Xiao et al. generated a mouse model in which miR-17~92 is artificially expressed in lymphocytes with hCD2-iCre [231]. This led to increased proliferation up to lymphoproliferative and autoimmune disease and premature death. In the same paper, the proapoptotic protein BIM (also known as Bcl-2-like protein 11, BCL2L11) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) were suggested as targets of miR-17 and miR-19: limitation of the protein expression to one allele only led to a similar phenotype as in miR-17~92 overexpressing cells. Among the first targets to be validated was PTEN, a repressor of PI3K, which is a target of miR-19a and miR-19b-1 [218]. Buckler et al. even reported that the requirement for CD28 during T cell activation is caused by the negative regulation of TCR signals by PTEN [232], which might even suggest that the induction of miR-17~92 is required for proper T cell activation, e.g. in the suppression of PTEN. Jiang et al. examined the effect of miR-17~92 expression on TH1 differentiation [208]. They showed that decreased miR-17~92 expression reduced proliferation and survival in vitro, and vice versa for miR-17~92 overexpression. In TH1 differentiation, Tbet and IFN production were reduced in miR-17~92 knockout cells. As a mechanism, they showed that miR-19b targets PTEN while miR-17 targeted cAMP response element binding (CREB1) and transforming growth factor beta receptor II (TGFRII), which facilitated effector T cell responses. Later, Wu et al. confirmed that the differentiation and expansion of TH1 cells is diminished in CD4+ T cells that are deficient for miR-17~92 expression [208, 233], and further reported that the formation of memory CD4+ T cells after LCMV infection is reduced. TH2 differentiation is impaired in CD4cre.miR-17~92fl/fl, while it is increased in CD4cre.miR-17~92tg mice [234]. Simpson et al. showed that this was linked to miR-19a and miR-19b expression, and their targeting effect on the mRNA of SOCS1, TNFAIP, and PTEN. The same pattern was reported for TH17 differentiation [235]. However, Zhu et al. could not confirm this finding: in their hands, miR-20b expression reduced TH17 differentiation in vitro and also suppressed extracerbated experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) progression in vivo [236]. Additionally, Montoya et al. showed that miR-18a acts as an inhibitor of TH17 differentiation by targeting SMAD4, HIF1 and ROR [237]. This especially interesting because these targets had been shown to be Introduction 32 targeted by other members of the cluster before - but in that case promoting differentiation and cytokine production. This suggests that the role of individual members of the same miRNA cluster is probably time and context dependent. Similar to TH17 differentiation, the reports regarding Treg cells and miR-17~92 expression are controversial: Jiang et al. reported that artificial miR-17~92 expression prevents inducible Treg differentiation [208]. In contrast to this, de Kouchkovsky et al. found that Foxp3cre.miR1792fl/fl mice were not able to control EAE [215], antigen specific Tregs could not accumulate and also IL-10 production was reduced, which suggested that there is an important role for miR-17~92 in Tregs as well. Interestingly, two years after this publication Yang et al. reported that CD4cre.miR1792fl/fl as well as Foxp3cre.miR1792fl/fl mice were less susceptible to EAE [238]. Moreover, they found that Foxp3cre.miR1792fl/fl CD4 cells were more suppressive in vitro. In their experiments they validated EOS, a Foxp3 co-regulator, as a target gene of miR-17. EOS was reduced upon miR-17 induction, whereas the expression of Foxp3 was unchanged. They suggested that the differences of their data in comparison to the previous study might be explained by the fact that their Tregs were not deficient in IL-10 production. Another explanation could be that two distinct Foxp3cre mouse models were used, which might explain differences in the knockout specificity. The differentiation of TFH and consequently GC B cells was shown to be dependent on miR-17~92 [134]. Baumjohann et al. confirmed in this publication the contribution of PTEN as a miR-17~92 target to TFH differentiation. However, they also showed that this gene could not be the only contributor to TFH differentiation in this context and additionally proposed ROR as a target gene. Limiting ROR to one allele only also led to a partial rescue in CD4cre.miR1792fl/fl cells, confirming that this gene was a target of miR-17~92 in TFH differentiation. PTEN is an inhibitor of PI3K, and PH Domain and Leucine Rich Repeat Protein Phosphatase 2 (PHLPP2, whose 3'UTR has one binding site for miR-17 and two for miR-92) acts on the same pathway by inactivating Akt. Using a mouse model in which miR-17~92 as well as paralogue clusters were knocked out, Kang et al. showed that knockdown of PHLPP2 partially rescued the effect of miR-17~92 (and paralogues) knockout in TFH differentiation [216]. After differentiation into TFH, the expression of miR-17~92 was reported to decline [216], probably due to Bcl-6 repression [133]. Introduction 33 Lastly, it was shown in a murine chronic graft-versus-host-disease (cGVHD) model that miR-17~92 expression in donor T and B cells is essential for the induction of scleroderma and bronchiolitis obliterans [239]. miR-17~92 enhanced the differentiation of pathogenic TH1 and TH17 cells as well as TFH and GC B cells, which are required for the generation of autoantibody production. The systemic application of anti-miR-17 in a lupus-like cGVHD model led to a milder phenotype of disease, with reduced skin damage and TH17 differentiation. These partially contrasting studies from the literature exemplify the complexity of regulation with miRNAs. It is therefore difficult to pinpoint \"the one and only\" role of miR-17~92 in CD4+ T cells. So far, we can conclude from existing studies that miR-17~92 promotes proliferation and survival, and to some extent differentiation as well as cytokine production of distinct TH subsets. However, it also becomes increasingly clear that single targets alone cannot explain for the large number of effects that were reported [240] and that instead, the understanding of the cooperation of different miRNAs targeting different genes at the same time might lead to a global understanding. One example for this is the cooperation of different miR-17~92 members in the regulation of TGF signaling, with miR-17 targeting TGFRII and others targeting downstream signaling molecules SMAD2 and SMAD4 [184, 227]. In this case, cluster members can be functionally redundant, but also act synergistically [184]. 3.2.3.4. miR-17~92 in human In humans, the miR-17~92 host gene is located at chromosome 13q31, with the transcript spanning 800bp. This genomic region is also often amplified in solid cancer and lymphomas, and the mature miRNAs are expressed in high amounts. Especially, significant overexpression of pri-mir1792 was reported in a study where 46 lymphoma samples were examined [223]. Germline deletion of miR-17~92 in humans is only reported in heterozygous manner, resulting in developmental defects reported in patients with Feingold syndrome [241]. Next to skeletal abnormalities, these patients also can show microcephaly as well as learning and developmental disabilities [227]. Moreover, also for human CD4+ T cells the miR-17~92 was shown to be important: miR-19a is elevated in human CD4+ T cells from asthmatic lungs. It promotes TH2 Introduction 34 phenotype by suppression of negative regulators of cytokines like PTEN, SOCS1, and A20 [234]. Moreover, miR-92a was shown to control the frequency of TFH precursors in type 1 diabetes islet autoimmunity by targeting FOXO1, PTEN and model, miRNA-92a antagomir application ameliorated the phenotype by lowering immune activation in the pancreas [242]. Aim of the project and Hypotheses 35 4. Aim of the project and Hypotheses Before this thesis project was started, it was known that CD4cre.miR-17~92fl/fl knockout mice show a phenotype which resembles CD28ko mice, and transgenic expression of miR-17~92 in CD4+ T cells led to a more activated phenotype. This led to the hypothesis that miR-17~92 might promote CD4+ T cell activation. Moreover, since miR-17~92 expression was known to be induced with CD28 co-stimulation, we suggested that exogenous expression of miR-17~92 might compensate for CD28 signaling during CD4+ T cell activation. If this was the case, processes which are dependent on CD4+ T cell activation, e.g. proliferation and differentiation, might be rescued as well. Mechanistically, miR-17~92 target genes should be repressed in overexpressing cells and increased if miR-17~92 expression was absent. Based on these hypotheses, we defined three main aims in this project: Aim 1: Correlate miR-17~92 expression with CD4+ T cell activation In this first part of the project, we asked: 1) Is miR-17~92 expression correlating with CD4+ T cell activation? 2) Does miR-17~92 promote a metabolic checkpoint which influences activation? Aim 2: Investigate if transgenic miR-17~92 expression rescues CD28 deficiency in CD4+ T cells The following questions were asked to specifically address this aim: 3) Can we rescue CD4+ T cell activation of CD28ko cells in vitro, e.g. IL-2 production, proliferation, and surface activation markers? 4) Can we rescue more complex processes like CD4+ T cell differentiation in vitro? 5) Does transgenic miR-17~92 expression rescue CD28ko CD4+ T cells in vivo, e.g. during LCMV response in the differentiation into TH1 and TFH? Aim 3: Identify miR-17~92 targets that explain for influences on CD4+ T cell activation In this part of the thesis, we wanted to address the molecular mechanism behind the rescue with the following questions: 6) Which are bona fide canonical miR-17~92 target genes in our specific system? 7) Is the CD28ko transcriptome rescued by transgenic miR-17~92 expression? 8) How does miR-17~92 promote CD4+ T cell activation? 9) Can we exploit the activating effect of miR-17~92 therapeutically? Mouse models and Methods 36 5. Mouse models and Methods 5.1. Mice 5.1.1. B6.CD4cre.miR-17~92lox In this mouse crossing the mouse to CD4cre mice [243], the locus is excised in all cells that do or did express CD4 (B6.CD4cre.miR-17~92lox, in the following abbreviated: miR1792lox). These mice were shown to have a defect in TFH differentiation during LCMV infection. In addition, CD4+ T cells are known to be less proliferative. 5.1.2. B6.CD4cre.Rosa26loxSTOPloxCAG-miR-17~92Tg For these mice, the human miR-17~92 locus was cloned into the Rosa26 locus as a transgene, preceded by a floxed stop cassette [231]. Upon crossing to CD4cre mice [243] the stop cassette is excised and all cells do or did express CD4 start to artificially overexpress the human miR-17~92 cluster (B6.CD4cre.Rosa26loxSTOPloxCAG-miR-17~92, in the following abbreviated: miR1792tg). Transgenic overexpression of miR-17~92 was reported to disease and splenomegaly in ageing mice. 5.1.3. B6.CD4cre.Rosa26loxSTOPloxCAG-miR-17-92Tg.Cd28ko(SMARTA) We crossed CD28ko mice [157] to the B6.CD4cre.Rosa26loxSTOPloxCAG-miR-17~92 mice. In the CD28ko mice, part of Exon 2 of the receptor was replaced by a neomycin resistance cassette so that there is very little remaining CD28 expression in all cells. The resulting strain was for some experiments additionally crossed to the SMARTA line, which expresses an MHC II restricted transgenic TCR that is specific for LCMV-glycoprotein (GP) [244]. Mouse models and Methods 37 5.2. Methods 5.2.1. Genotyping Toes were clipped at day 10 and digested in tail lysis buffer with proteinase K for at least 3h at 55\u00b0C shaking at 600rpm. Remaining debris were pelleted and discarded, DNA was then precipitated with isopropanol (1:1 ratio) and spun down. The pellet was washed with 70% Ethanol and resuspend in dH2O. Most genotypings were performed according to the protocols indicated at the vendors webpage. As for SMARTA genotyping, in addition to the PCR blood was taken at the time of organ harvest for the experiments and mixed with Heparin. Erythrocytes were then lysed with ACK lysis buffer for 2min. Remaining lymphocytes were washed with FACS and stained for CD3, CD4, V2 and V8.3. 5.2.2. Organ and blood isolation Organs were obtained after CO2 euthanization and kept on ice during cervical LN spleen were taken for most of the experiments. Spleens were injected with 0.5ml ACK lysis buffer for erythrolysis before processing. The organs were meshed with 0.4\u00b5m filters to obtain single cell suspensions which were then washed with FACS buffer. 5.2.3. Na\u00efve CD4+ T cell isolation Na\u00efve CD4+ T cells were isolated from cell suspensions with pooled lymph nodes and spleen. Isolation was performed with StemCell mouse na\u00efve CD4+ T cell isolation kit according to manufacturer's instructions. In brief, the cell suspensions were incubated with rat serum and CD4 isolation antibody for 7.5 minutes, then with memory depletion antibody for 2.5 minutes, and in the end with magnetic beads for another 2.5min before incubating with the isolation magnet for 2.5min. The resulting untouched na\u00efve CD4+ T cells were then washed with FACS buffer, and purity was routinely checked with a staining for CD4, CD44 and viability. 5.2.4. Plate-bound CD4+ T cell activation Plates were coated over night with 0.2\u00b5g CD28 and 0.5\u00b5g CD3 per ml PBS for most of the experiments (low stimulation as according to [134]). Plates were washed with Mouse models and Methods 38 PBS before plating 2*105 na\u00efve CD4+ T cells per well in 96 well flat-bottom in 200\u00b5l medium. For 24 well plates, 2*106 na\u00efve CD4+ T cells per ml medium were plated. 5.2.5. In vitro differentiation TH1 differentiation conditions were generated with 50U IL-2, 5ng/ml IL-12 and 10\u00b5g/ml IL-4 per ml T cell medium [245]. iTregs were either differentiated with or without retinoic 10\u00b5g/ml IL-4 medium [247]. For the differentiation, 2*105 na\u00efve CD4+ T cells were plated on a pre-coated 96-well flat bottom plate (coated over night with 0.2\u00b5g CD28, 0.5\u00b5g CD3 per ml PBS) and harvested at 24h, 48h or 72h after plating. 5.2.6. Seahorse This protocol was adapted from our collaborators from the Hess laboratory at the Department of Biomedicine, Basel. Calibration plates were coated over night with 200\u00b5l calibrant. Cell were Biotech, CH). The following day, cell plates were washed with H2O and left for drying during cell preparation. Compounds were prepared for a final in-well concentration of 1\u00b5M for Oligomycin, 2\u00b5M for Rotenone. or activated) were harvested with glucose-free, unbuffered RPMI, washed and counted multiple times before plating 3*105 cells per well. Mitochondrial perturbation was performed by sequential injection of glucose (80mM stock), oligomycin, FCCP and rotenone. of and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR; mpH/min) a Seahorse XF96 flux analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, USA). Data analysis was performed using Prism (Version7.0d), mitochondrial parameters were calculated as 5.2.7. FACS Staining For cytokine stainings or ex vivo e.g. for IL-2 staining, cells were at 37\u00b0C before staining. Cells were then first stained for viability with Mouse models and Methods 39 viability dye 780 in PBS for 20min at 4\u00b0C and then washed with PBS. Non-specific binding was blocked with CD16/CD32 0.5mg/ml on ice for 10min. Surface stainings were performed in FACS buffer for 20-30min at 4\u00b0C. Cell fixation was performed with Fix-Perm on 4\u00b0C (1h for LCMV in permeabilization buffer for 1h at 4\u00b0C. Data was acquired with an LSR Fortessa and analyzed with FlowJo (version 10.4.1) 5.2.8. Proliferation assay with cell trace violet (CTV) Freshly isolated na\u00efve CD4+ T cells were washed with PBS. 1\u00b5l of Cell Trace stock solution (dissolved in DMSO according to the manufacturer's instructions) was then used per ml PBS for 10*106 cells. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 20min, then 5x the original staining volume of normal T cell culture medium was added for 5min to remove residual dye. Cells were washed and plated in complete culture medium supplied with 50U IL-2 per ml. 5.2.9. RNA extraction for qPCR For any experiment involving RNA, cells were washed with PBS before counting and the RNA was kept on ice during the experiments, storage at -80\u00b0C. All pipetting was performed with filter-tips and RNAse-free tubes. 5*105 cells were washed resuspend in 400\u00b5l TRIreagent. RNA isolation was then performed according to the isolation protocol from TRIreagent supplier (SIGMA). In brief, 0.1ml of 1-bromo-3-chloropropane per ml of TRI Reagent was added, samples were mixed by vigorous shaking, incubated for 15min at room temperature and then centrifuged at 12'000g for 15min at 4\u00b0C for phase separation. The aqueous phase was then mixed with 0.5 ml of isopropanol per ml of TRI Reagent used, again centrifuged for 10min for RNA precipitation. RNA was then washed with 70% Ethanol and finally resuspend in RNAse-free water. RNA concentration and purity was determined with a Nanodrop2000 Spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific). 5.2.10. RNA extraction for RNA sequencing, protein extraction and digestion for proteomics All procedures for the extractions were performed at the facilities with materials, protocols and supervision of the facility experts. Mouse models and Methods 40 For RNA sequencing, 2.5*105 cells were washed with PBS and resuspend in 200\u00b5l TRI Reagent. RNA was extracted from Trizol-samples in the RNA sequencing facility at the Biozentrum Basel with a Zymo Direct-zol kit which includes DNAse treatment. Quality control was run with a Bioanalyzer. For targeted proteomics, 2.5*105 cells were washed with PBS and pellets were frozen on dry ice. Proteins were extracted at the proteomics facility at the Biozentrum Basel and digested for mass spectrometry with Lys-C and Trypsin. Samples were spiked with heavy labeled synthetic peptides of our RCAN3 target protein for measurement. 5.2.11. RNA sequencing data analysis Data analysis for the RNA sequencing data was performed by Julien Roux from the Swiss Institute of bioinformatics, Department of Biomedicine, Basel. He describes his procedure as the following: \"RNA quality was assessed with a Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical) and RNA-seq library preparation (Illumina Truseq stranded kit) was performed at the Genomics Facility Basel of the ETH Zurich. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina NexSeq 500 machine to produce single-end 76-mers reads. Read quality was assessed with the FastQC tool (version 0.11.5). Reads were mapped to the mouse genome (UCSC version mm10) with STAR (version 2.5.2a) [249] with default parameters, except filtering out reads mapping to more than 10 genomic locations (outFilterMultimapNmax=10), reporting only one hit in the final alignment for multimappers (outSAMmultNmax=1) and filtering reads without evidence in the spliced junction table (outFilterType=\"BySJout\"). All subsequent gene expression data analysis was performed using the R software (version 3.5). Read alignment quality was evaluated using the qQCReport function of the R Bioconductor package QuasR (version 1.18). Gene expression was quantified using the qCount function of QuasR [250] as the number of reads (5'ends) overlapping with the exons of each gene assuming an exon union model (using the UCSC knownGenes annotation downloaded on 2015-12-18). To quantify intronic expression levels, exonic coordinates were extended by 10 bp on each side of the exons, and for each gene the resulting read count was subtracted to the read count obtained on the whole gene (extended by 10 bp on each side). Mouse models and Methods 41 The R Bioconductor package edgeR (version 3.24.3)[251] was used for differential gene expression analysis. Between samples normalization was done using the TMM method [252]. Only genes with CPM (counts per million reads mapped) values more than 1 in at least 4 samples (the number of biological replicates) were retained. An generalized linear model including a genotype effect, an activation effect, and a replicate effect (nested within genotype) was fitted to the raw counts (function glmFit), and differential expression was tested using likelihood ratio tests (function glmLRT). P-values were adjusted by controlling the false-discovery rate (Benjamini-Hochberg method) and genes with a FDR lower than 1% were considered differentially expressed. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed with the function camera [253] from the edgeR package (using the default parameter value of 0.01 for the correlations of genes within gene sets) using gene sets from the curated gene set collection of the Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB v6.0)[254] with special focus on KEGG [255], Biocarta and Reactome [256] gene sets. We considered only sets containing more than 10 genes and gene sets with a false discovery rate lower than 5% were considered significant.\" 5.2.12. Reverse transcription (RT) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) Reverse transcription was performed with RNA extracted with TRIzol and the SIGMA MMLV kit on 1\u00b5g RNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. qPCR was run with TaqMan FAST Universal PCR master mix on an Applied Biosystems\u00ae Real-Time PCR System. 18S was used as a reference 5.2.13. Glucose uptake staining with 2-NBDG 2*105 na\u00efve CD4+ T cells were washed with complete T cell medium and then incubated with complete T cell culture medium plus 50\u00b5M 2-NBDG for 30min at 37\u00b0c. 5X the original staining volume of complete T cell culture medium was then added for 5min to remove residual dye. Cells were washed again with PBS and stained for viability and surface markers before FACS analysis. 5.2.14. Cell preparation for metabolomics 5*106 CD4+ T cells were washed with PBS and centrifuged several times with decreasing the volume, so that the cell pellet could be frozen. The pellets were then Mouse models and Methods 42 shipped on dry ice to the NIH West Coast Metabolomics center for further processing and metabolomic analysis. 5.2.15. GC-MS data Detailed information on the procedure with frozen cell pellets performed by the Metabolomics Central Service Core facility at the University of California Davis Genome Center can be found in their protocol provided in the Appendix (see section 13.2). Data analysis for the metabolomic data was performed by Julien Roux from the Swiss Institute of bioinformatics, Department of Biomedicine, Basel. He describes his procedure as the following: \"Raw data (unnormalized peak heights) were obtained from the West Coast Metabolomics Center (University of California, Davis). Normalization and differential metabolite abundance was performed similarly to the RNA-seq differential expression analysis, but instead of edgeR, the Bioconductor package limma (function eBayes with options trend=TRUE and robust=TRUE)[257] was used on the log-transformed peak heights divided by the sum of peak heights for each sample (analogous to counts-per-million values for RNA-seq analyses).\" 5.2.16. Enzyme-linked with the BioLegend ELISA MAX mouse IL-2 set according to the manufacturer's instructions. After the last washing step, TMB substrate was added for the readout. Absorbance was measured with an ELISA plate reader (Synergy H1 Hybrid Reader, BioTek) at 450nm as well as 570nm wavelength, and normalized to wild type controls. 5.2.17. LCMV Armstrong infection model Mice were infected with 2*105 strain from Anna\u00efse Jauch, Recher laboratory. Eight days post infection, the animals were euthanized with CO2 and the spleens were harvested for staining (for gating strategy, see Appendix, Figure 40). Restimulation of splenocytes was performed in flat bottom 96 well plates with 1\u00b5g/ml LCMV-specific peptide GP-64 in comparison to models and Methods 43 500ng/ml Ionomycin stimulation for one hour, then 10\u00b5g/ml Brefeldin A was added for another three hours before staining. 5.2.18. Histology Spleens were embedded in cryo embedding medium and frozen on dry ice before storage at -80\u00b0C. Sections were cut at a thickness of 6\u00b5m and dried on air. Single sections were then fixed with acetone for 5min and circled with PAP pen. Staining for CD19, CD4 and GL-7 was performed in FACS buffer with CD16/CD32 in a wet chamber overnight. Slides were then washed with PBS on a shaker for 15min before drying and mounting. Imaging was performed with a 20x objective on a Nikon Ti2 microscope. 5.2.19. Adoptive transfer with subsequent LCMV infection Na\u00efve SMARTA+ CD4+ T cells from wt, CD28ko and rescue mice were isolated transferred into CD28ko recipients. Each recipient received 1*105 cells in 100\u00b5l PBS i.v.. The recipients were infected with 2*105 PFU LCMV Armstrong i.p. two days after cell transfer. Eight days after infection, the mesenteric and peripheral LN as well as the spleen were analyzed separately for the presence of V2+V8.3+ T cells as well as CD44 expression (for gating strategy, see Appendix, Figure 41). One CD28ko mouse that did not receive donor cells was used as a negative control to display the recipient-intrinsic V2+V8.3+ population. 5.2.20. CsA titration The sensitivity of CD28ko and rescue cells to compounds interfering with Ca2+ signaling was tested. Increasing amounts of CsA were added to the cultures during activation: 2*105 na\u00efve CD4+ T cells were plated in 100\u00b5l complete T cell medium in pre-coated 96 well plates. 100\u00b5l of a serial dilution of CsA were then added to result 0ng/ml. then activated in the presence of these CsA concentrations for 48h before harvesting and staining for viability and activation markers. Mouse models and Methods 44 5.2.21. ImageStream Na\u00efve CD4+ T cells were isolated and activated for 48h in the presence of 6.25ng/ml CsA as described before. They were then harvested and washed with PBS before fixation for 20min at 4\u00b0C. Intracellular staining for NFATc2 was performed in a two-step staining with first 1h at room temperature (RT) with NFATc2 in permeabilization buffer, and subsequently 1h at room temperature (RT) with goat anti-mouse IgG1 in permeabilization buffer. Nuclei were stained with DAPI in the last 5min of incubation. Acquisition was run on an ImageStreamX Mark2 Imaging flow cytometer (Amnis), and data analysis was performed with the IDEAS software (v6.2). 5.2.22. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism (v7.0d, Graphpad Software). No Gaussian Distribution was assumed for any of the experiments, and tests were chosen individually depending on the type of experiment. The overall statistical significance was set to 5% (=0.05), and error bars represent standard deviation (SD). We used Kruskal-Wallis tests for most of the experiments where more than two unpaired groups were compared in one parameter (e.g. %Fas+GL7+ population in three genotypes), followed by Dunn's multiple comparison. We used two-way Anova for experiments in which samples were in different in two parameters (e.g. %CD44hiCD62lo population in three genotypes activated with or without CD28), followed by Tukey's multiple comparison. T-test was used for the analysis of targeted proteomics (each sample compared to wt) as instructed by the facility experts. Results 45 6. Results So far, most studies in murine lymphocytes that investigated the role of miR-17~92 in CD4+ T cells focused on either the comparison between miR-17~92 knockout to wt or miR-17~92 overexpression to wt. For example, Xiao et al. showed that elevated miR-17~92 expression in lymphocytes results in lymphoproliferative and autoimmune phenotypes with increased proliferation and cytokine expression in CD4+ T cells [231]. This observation led us to our first hypothesis that miR-17~92 promotes T cell activation. However, like in most of the other studies on miR-17 B6.CD4cre.miR-17~92lox 92 in lymphocytes, they did not do a side-by-side comparison of these two genotypes (see section 3.2.3.3). To directly compare the effect of lack or overexpression of miR-17~92 on the activation of CD4+ T cells we took advantage of previously published mouse models B6.CD4cre.miR-17~92lox (miR1792lox) and B6.CD4cre.Rosa26loxSTOPloxCAG-miR-17~92 (miR1792tg) wt controls. 6.1. miR-17~92 expression promotes CD4+ T cell activation 6.1.1. IL-2 production and proliferation is promoted by miR-17~92 expression To test our hypothesis if miR-17~92 expression promotes T cell activation ex vivo, we followed previous literature [231] and investigated IL-2 production and proliferation in a side by side comparison in CD4+ T cells from miR1792lox, wt and miR1792tg mice. In order to determine intracellular IL-2 production, freshly isolated murine na\u00efve CD4+ T cells were activated with PMA and ionomycin (iono) for three hours. Already at this very early time point we found an ~0.6-fold reduced production of IL-2 in miR1792lox cells in comparison to wt, whereas miR1792tg cells showed an ~1.7-fold increase in comparison to wt cells (Figure 11A). This pattern was also true for IL-2 secretion measured by ELISA from 48h culture supernatants (Figure 11B): miR1792lox cells secreted only half of the secreted by wt cells while miR1792tg secreted ~1.2-fold more. The proliferation capacity was slightly, but not significantly (probably due to small number of samples) reduced in miR1792lox as compared to wt, and slightly increased in miR1792tg in comparison to wt (Figure 11C) even in the presence Results 46 of exogenous recombinant IL-2, which is consistent with previous reports [134, 231]. The direct comparison between miR1792lox and miR1792tg shows significantly more proliferation with increased miR-17~92 expression, which suggests that miR-17~92 positively correlates with proliferation. From these results, we concluded that miR-17~92 indeed promotes IL-2 production and proliferation in murine CD4+ T cells. Figure 11. miR-17~92 expression promotes IL-2 production and proliferation in CD4+ T cells. miR1792lox (grey), wt (black), miR1792tg (blue). Error bars show mean \u00b1SD, Dunn's stimulated with PMA/Iono/BFA for 3h after isolation. Data represent four independent experiments with 3-4 biological replicates per group. B) IL-2 secretion measured by ELISA in supernatants of activated with plate-bound 0.2\u00b5g CD28/ 0.5\u00b5g CD3 per ml PBS for coating. Data represent four independent experiments with 3-4 biological replicates per group. C) Proliferation of CD4+ T cells activated for 48h with CD3/CD28 stimulation and 50U IL-2 per ml T cell medium. Data represent two independent experiments. 6.1.2. miR-17~92 and metabolism in CD4+ T cell activation Upon activation, CD4+ T cells are expected to undergo glycolytic switch [37] in a CD28-dependent manner (see section 3.1.8.4). The TF Myc which controls metabolic reprogramming in T cells [171] was also shown to induce miR-17~92 expression [225]. Izreig et al. reported that miR-17~92 expression is essential for the metabolic reprogramming of Myc+ tumor cells [226], and others had previously shown that metabolic checkpoints can restrict differentiation of distinct T cell subsets [258]. We therefore hypothesized that miR-17~92 expression promotes CD4+ T cell activation by promoting one specific metabolic pathway, leading to the passage through such a checkpoint. We examined the metabolic profile of na\u00efve CD4+ T cells by metabolic flux analysis and by performing a glucose uptake assay using 2-NBDG. Glycolytic (extracellular acidification rate, ECAR) and respiratory consumption rate, Results 47 OCR) activity of na\u00efve CD4+ T cells, as determined by using a mitochondria stress test, appeared similar between genotypes (Figure 12A). There was, however, a marked difference in 2-NBDG uptake between all groups with miR1792tg T cells taking up 20% more 2-NBDG than wt cells (Figure 12B), whereas 2-NBDG uptake was proportionally lower in miR1792lox cells. Figure 12. miR-17~92 expression modifies glucose uptake but not mitochondrial activity in na\u00efve CD4+ T cells. miR1792lox (grey), wt (black), miR1792tg (blue) A) Mitochondria stress test measured with a 96-well seahorse in na\u00efve CD4+ T cells. Eight biological replicates from two experiments are shown. left: Extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), right: with 2-NBDG. red: unstained control, median fluorescence intensity of the high uptake population is compared to wt. Data represent three independent experiments. Dunn's multiple comparison test, p values: ns=not significant, ****<0.0001 Since our previous results indicated that miR-17~92 cluster influences the outcome of CD4+ T cell activation, we also performed metabolic flux analysis on activated CD4+ T cells from all three genotypes. Activated CD4+ T cells that were deficient in miR-17~92 expression displayed slightly lower glycolytic rates than wt and miR1792tg T cells (Figure 13A) as well as lower basal and ATP coupled respiration (Figure 13B). These findings indicate that the miR-17~92 cluster might be involved in the regulation of metabolic reprogramming in activated CD4+ T cells. Results 48 Figure 13. miR-17~92 expression modifies mitochondrial activity in activated CD4+ T cells. A) Mitochondria stress test measured with a 96-well seahorse in 48h activated CD4+ T cells. 3-8 biological replicates from four experiments are shown. Tukey's multiple comparison test, values: *<0.0332 C) (after coupled respiration (before-after oligomycin addition [248]) To further evaluate the metabolic profile of these cells and elucidate which pathways are influenced by miR-17~92 expression, we performed mass spectrometry-based global metabolomic analysis on activated T cell lysates. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed small differences in the metabolome between all three genotypes (Figure 14). Figure 14. miR-17~92 expression introduces small differences in the metabolome of activated CD4+ T cells. CD4+ T cells were activated for 48h with plate-bound CD3 and CD28 before harvest as described in the Methods section. miR1792lox (grey), wt (black), miR1792tg (blue) However, direct comparison of miR1792lox and miR1792tg cells revealed only eight metabolites that were differentially abundant (minimum 2-fold change (FC), p value<0.01, logFC>1 indicates higher abundance in miR1792tg) (Table 1). Intriguingly, of the eight metabolites, seven associated with either cysteine, fatty acid or purine Results 49 metabolism. Lactic acid, which is the end-product of glycolysis, was also found to be less abundant in miR1792lox cells as compared to miR1792tg cells. This confirmed our seahorse data where miR1792lox cells showed slightly lower glycolytic rate. Table 1. List of differentially abundant metabolites in the comparison between of the metabolomic data set, we took advantage of an RNA sequencing data set that we generated for the same project but will be analyzed in more detail later (see section 6.3.1). Here, we focused on samples of 48h activated CD4+ T cells from miR1792lox, wt and miR1792tg mice of which we isolated total RNA for sequencing. We investigated the RNA sequencing data set for enzymes that are promoting the build-up or processing of the differentially abundant metabolites (Table 1) or metabolic pathways that are promoted. Direct target genes would be e.g. inhibitors of glycolysis, thereby possibly promoting activation of CD4+ T cells following modulation of miR-17~92 expression. However, even if single metabolism-associated genes were differentially expressed, the RNA sequencing data did not show any metabolic pathway that was globally impacted by modulation of miR-17~92 expression. Moreover, changes in metabolite abundance were rather small. With this, we conclude that our data does not support the hypothesis that miR-17~92 expression promotes or represses one specific metabolic pathway during CD4+ T cell activation. Instead, since we do see a slightly increased glycolytic activity, our data suggests that miR-17~92 expression might affect metabolism indirectly, i.e. by promoting a \"more activated\" cell phenotype which consequently is metabolically more active. Results 50 6.2. Transgenic miR-17~92 expression rescues CD28 deficiency From the data illustrated above, and from previous publications we concluded that miR-17~92 indeed promotes T cell activation. Moreover, it promotes the processes that are known to be strongly dependent on CD28 co-stimulation, and in turn loss of miR-17~92 expression phenocopies loss of CD28 signaling. This was true for IL-2 production [162] and proliferation [259] but also more complex processes like TFH differentiation [134]. Additionally, Xiao et al. had shown that miR1792tg cells proliferated more than wt cells when they received CD3 stimulus without CD28 co-stimulation [231]. This suggested that ectopic miR-17~92 expression does confer a co-stimulatory signal. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that miR-17~92 is part of the CD28 signaling cascade, and contributes to the essential \"signal 2\". To test this hypothesis, we created a new mouse model by crossing B6.CD4cre.Rosa26loxSTOPloxCAG-miR-17~92 to CD28ko [157], resulting in B6.CD4cre.Rosa26loxSTOPloxCAG-miR-17~92.CD28ko mice, called \"rescue\" in the following results. If our hypothesis holds true, we expect in this mouse model that the transgenic expression of miR-17~92 should (partially) compensate for loss of CD28 signaling. We first analyzed mesenteric lymph nodes (LN), peripheral LN, thymus, spleen and Peyer's patches of this new mouse model to determine the baseline phenotype of CD28ko and rescue in comparison to wt. We did not find any significant difference in organ size or CD4+ T cell numbers, neither between CD28ko and wt nor between CD28ko and rescue (data not shown), as it had been shown for CD28 deficient mice by Shahinian et al. [157]. We furthermore stained for baseline populations of TFH and Tregs and also there did not find differences in CD28ko (and subsequent rescue). We therefore decided to isolate CD4+ T cells to specifically test CD4+ T cell activation in vitro. 6.2.1. Transgenic miR-17~92 expression rescues CD28 deficiency in vitro We isolated na\u00efve CD4+ T cells from wt, CD28ko and rescue mice to investigate IL-2 and proliferation and see if the transgenic expression of miR-17~92 could compensate for the loss of this co-stimulatory signal. Following up our data on Results 51 miR1792lox/wt/miR1792tg comparisons (see Figure 11A), we stimulated CD28ko, wt and rescue cells for three hours with PMA and iono. CD28ko CD4+ T cells produced half of the IL-2 amount that was measured in wt cells, while rescue cells produced ~2.5-fold more than wt (Figure 15A). This suggested that transgenic miR-17~92 could not only compensate for CD28 signaling, the transgene even led to increased production of IL-2 in the absence of CD28. Moreover, the proliferation capacity of wt clearly depended on CD28 co-stimulation (proliferation index of wt with CD28 1.51\u00b10.13, without 1.28\u00b10.07), which was expected from the literature [259], and CD28ko cells only proliferated at very basal levels (proliferation index of CD28ko with CD28 1.17\u00b10.07, without 1.16\u00b10.08). However, the rescue cells proliferated like CD3/CD28 stimulated wt cells (Figure 15B) (proliferation index of rescue cells with CD28 1.45\u00b10.16, without 1.40\u00b10.10), suggesting that transgenic miR-17~92 expression can compensate for the signal given by CD28 also for proliferation. Of note, since the proliferation experiment was performed in the presence of exogenous IL-2, this effect was unlikely to be due to differential IL-2 production. Figure 15.

After 48h activation with CD28 co-stimulation, the size of cells, shown as FSC-A (Figure 16), was increased in CD28/CD3 stimulated wt cells in comparison to samples that were stimulated with CD3 alone (median fluorescence intensity CD28 130k\u00b115k, without 126k\u00b118k), and transgenic miR-17~92 expression rescued blasting of rescue cells to an extent that was comparable to CD28/CD3 stimulated wt cells (MFI FSC-A of rescue with CD28 162k\u00b111k, without 156k\u00b116k). This indicated that also for the induction of blasting, transgenic miR-17~92 expression could compensate for the CD28 co-stimulatory signal.

We therefore activated wt, CD28ko and rescue cells for 48h and stained for early activation markers CD25 and CD69. CD25, the high affinity IL-2 receptor subunit, is essential for proper T cell activation and IL-2 uptake [79, 260] and known to be CD28 dependent. All genotypes and conditions developed similar percentages of CD69+CD25+ populations (Figure 17A). CD69 expression was not significantly changed among all conditions and genotypes, which was expected from the literature since it Results 53 is dependent on TCR signaling [117]. In contrast, the MFI of CD25 was strongly dependent CD28 CD25 of rescue CD28 16.3\u00b12.3k, without 15.9k\u00b12.6k). We additionally stained for \"late\" activation markers CD44/CD62L: while na\u00efve cells show a CD44loCD62Lhi phenotype, activated cells are expected to express high CD44 but low CD62L. CD28/CD3 stimulated wt cells showed a significant increase in their CD44hiCD62Llo population (%CD44hiCD62Llo of wt with CD28 25.4\u00b19.9%, without 13.5\u00b15.6%) compared to CD3 stimulation alone (Figure 17B), and CD28ko cells resembled 9.2\u00b15.5%). However, exogenous miR-17~92 expression led to even higher percentages of CD44hiCD62Llo populations (%CD44hiCD62Llo of rescue with CD28 38.5\u00b110.4%, without 36.3\u00b18.9%) in rescue cells as compared to wt.

Exogenous miR-17~92 expression compensates for CD28 deficiency during in vitro differentiation The miR-17~92 cluster was reported to promote the differentiation of TH1 [208, 233], TH2 generation [208]. Moreover, CD28 was shown to be important for the same differentiation processes. This led us to hypothesize that transgenic miR-17~92 expression might also compensate for CD28 signaling during early differentiation. We therefore performed differentiation assays with wt, CD28ko, rescue and miR1792tg cells and analyzed the development of TH1, TH17 and iTreg subsets during very early time points of differentiation. When we investigated TH1 differentiation (Figure 18), we found that already at 24h after plating in TH1 skewing conditions, Tbet upregulation was induced in wt, but almost absent in CD28ko cells. Transgenic expression of miR-17~92 over compensated for Tbet induction in rescue cells, and miR1792tg cells also CD28ko cells induced Tbet, even though not as efficiently as wt, while rescue and miR1792tg were still higher in Tbet expression as Tbet induction is delayed in CD28ko cells, and rescued by transgenic miR-17~92 expression. IFN production was very low at 24h in all genotypes, however already at 48h post induction IFN production was induced in wt cells. This was almost absent in CD28ko, and over compensated in rescue cells while miR1792tg cells expressed the not able to reach wt IFN induction at 72h, while rescue and miR1792tg continued to express more IFN as compared this data we Results 55 concluded that miR-17~92 promotes different aspects of TH1 differentiation, which confirms published data [208]. Importantly, the same processes are regulated by CD28 expression as well. Consequently, exogenous miR-17~92 expression rescued of delayed Tbet expression as well as IFN production in CD28ko cells. Figure 18. Transgenic miR-17~92 expression over compensates for CD28 signaling during in vitro TH1 differentiation.

Data from two independent experiments are shown, with representative FACS plots of each timepoint and genotype. Error bars show mean \u00b1SD, no statistical analysis was performed due to large variation. TH1 differentiation was stained with IFN and Tbet in viable CD4+ T cells, Tbet+ cells include both gates while Tbet+IFN+ are shown in the right gate only Next, we investigated TH17 differentiation (Figure 19). In contrast to TH1 differentiation, induction of lineage-defining TF Rort induction was CD28ko only rescued by exogenous miR-17~92 expression of CD28ko cells was reduced also in following time points, and partially rescued at 48h. In addition, the miR1792tg cells resembled Rort expression was still reduced in Results 56 CD28ko cells in comparison to wt and miR1792tg, but fully rescued by started at 48h. Wt produced IL-17A, while CD28ko cells were deficient and only partially rescued by transgenic miR-17~92 expression while miR1792tg cells however CD28ko cells still produced less IL-17A in comparison to wt, which was only partially rescued by transgenic miR-17~92 expression. Interestingly, miR1792tg cells that for in vitro TH17 differentiation, exogenous miR-17~92 expression can only partially compensate for CD28 signaling. Intriguingly, in this T cell subset the timing Figure 19. Transgenic miR-17~92 expression can partially compensate for CD28 signal during in vitro TH17 differentiation.

Results 57 seems to be very relevant for the role of the cluster. Our experiments confirm published data that miR-17~92 overexpression prevents TH17 differentiation [237] in early stage of in vitro differentiation, however in our setting at later time points the inhibitory effect is lost. Finally, we performed iTreg differentiation (Figure 20). At 24h post induction, the population of Foxp3+CD25+ cells was massively reduced in the CD28ko samples in comparison to wt, which was fully rescued by exogenous miR-17~92 expression. miR1792tg cells were similar to in all genotypes at 48h, however CD28ko samples still showed reduced Foxp3+CD25+ populations in comparison to all other samples at high percentages at 72h post induction, CD28ko cells further increased their population (wt 73.8\u00b121.7%, CD28ko 55.6\u00b112.2%, Figure 20. Transgenic miR-17~92 expression can compensate for CD28 signal during in vitro iTreg differentiation. Na\u00efve CD4+ T cells were activated plate-bound in the (black, left), CD28ko (purple, second from left), rescue (dark blue, second from right) and miR1792tg (light blue, right). Data from two independent experiments are shown, with representative FACS plots of each timepoint and genotype. Error bars show mean \u00b1SD, Tukey's multiple comparison, p values: ns, not significant, ***<0.001, represents 58 rescue at 72h). We concluded that the induction of Foxp3+CD25+ differentiation is delayed in CD28ko cells, but can be fully rescued by transgenic miR-17~92 expression. For the analysis of differentiation of TH subsets and iTregs, we had pre-gated on viable CD4+ cells. Interestingly, when we investigated the viability of cells in all of these subsets, we additionally found time-, genotype- and subset specific differences: in TH1 differentiation, viability was comparable among genotypes at each time point. In contrast, during TH17 differentiation at 72h CD28ko cells were markedly reduced in their viability as compared to wt cells. This was partially rescued by transgenic miR-17~92 expression, and miR1792tg cells were similar to wt cells 72h) (Figure 21, middle). The same pattern could be observed in iTreg differentiation: CD28ko cells showed reduced viability in comparison to wt, while transgenic miR-17~92 partially rescued viability (though not significantly, which again might be due to sample size) and miR1792tg cells were comparable to wt cells (viability in iTreg differentiation wt 57.5\u00b114.6%, CD28ko 21.9\u00b18.1%, rescue Figure 21. CD4+ viability is decreased in CD28ko cells at 72h post differentiation induction in TH17 and iTreg differentiation Na\u00efve CD4+ T plate-bound (0.2\u00b5g/ml CD28 0.5\u00b5g/ml CD3) in the TH1 (50U IL-2, 5ng/ml (black, left), CD28ko (purple, second from left), rescue (dark blue, second from right) and miR1792tg (light blue, right). Data from two independent experiments are shown, with representative FACS plots of each timepoint and genotype. Error bars show mean \u00b1SD, Tukey's multiple comparison, p values: ns, Results 59 36.5\u00b112.4%, miR1792tg 56.1\u00b111.7% at 72h) (Figure 21, right). This data suggests that in addition to subset-specific induction of TFs and cytokines, miR-17~92 is important for survival at later time points as well as it was demonstrated before [261]. However, since at early time points no difference was seen among genotypes in any of the subsets, this also suggests that survival cannot account for differences in the outcome of early differentiation assays. Overall we found a defect for differentiation of CD28ko cells in all tested T cell subsets and could observe a partial or complete rescue effect by transgenic miR-17~92 expression. However, timing and extent of rescue varied between subsets: while TH1 was even promoted in comparison to wt in rescue cells, TH17 differentiation was only partially rescued and iTreg differentiation was fully rescued to wt percentage. We concluded from these experiments that exogenous miR-17~92 expression rescues TH1, TH17 and iTreg differentiation partially in the absence of CD28 stimulation, but the relative contribution is variable and context dependent. Moreover, since all of the tested subsets were affected, these results suggested that there might be targets of miR-17~92 that are common among different TH subsets. 6.2.3. Transgenic miR-17~92 expression rescues CD28 deficiency in CD4+ T cells in vivo For an adaptive immune response, not only the secretion of cytokines by TH subsets is important, but also the specialized help of TFH to B cells, which is strongly dependent on CD28 co-stimulation [140] as well as miR-17~92 expression [134]. We therefore hypothesized that deficient TFH differentiation in CD28ko mice could be rescued by transgenic miR-17~92 expression. To investigate the generation of TFH and TH1 responses in vivo we infected our mice with LCMV Armstrong. This virus strain is known to elicit an acute viral infection, causing TFH and TH1 differentiation, and is usually cleared by day eight post infection [262]. We infected wt, CD28ko and rescue mice and analyzed the spleens eight days post infection. In line with our in vitro data (Figure 17B), we observed a decreased CD44 expression in CD28ko CD4+ T cells in comparison to wt cells, which was rescued by transgenic miR-17~92 expression (wt 67.5\u00b114.8%, CD28ko 19.1\u00b18.8%, rescue 40.2\u00b113.6%) 60 Figure 22.

Error bars represent mean \u00b1SD, Dunn's multiple p values: ns=not significant, *<0.05, **<0.002, ***<0.0002, ****<0.0001. Data represent four independent experiments with four mice per group. To identify TFH we used key markers Bcl-6, ICOS, CXCR5 and PD-1 (Figure 23A). CD28ko mice showed a 5-fold reduced population in comparison to wt mice, which was rescued by transgenic miR-17~92 expression in Bcl-6/ICOS (wt 7.5\u00b12.7%, 1.3\u00b10.8%, rescue 5.8\u00b15.4%), independent from marker combination. TFH are essential for the formation of GC and the differentiation of GC B cells which are characterized by GL-7 and Fas expression. Consequently, also GC formation is strongly dependent on the CD28 co-stimulatory signal [140], therefore we investigated if GC B cells are rescued as a secondary effect of rescued TFH cells. We observed a significantly reduced population of GC B cells in CD28ko as compared to wt mice, which was rescued with transgenic miR-17~92 expression (Figure 23B) (wt 8.0\u00b12.3%, CD28ko 3.4\u00b11.0%, in histological staining (Figure 23C), where we stained cryo-sections of spleens for CD4 and CD19 to distinguish B and T cell zones and then identified GC B cells as GL-7+. From this, we concluded that the TFH population is rescued in their function, i.e. GC B cell formation and structural organization of the GC. To test for TH1 differentiation we used GP-64, reduced in CD28ko as compared to wt cells but not significantly increased in rescue Results 61 cells (wt 23.2\u00b114.4%, CD28ko 6.6\u00b14.5%, rescue 17.8\u00b114.3%) (Figure was 5-fold reduced in CD28ko in comparison to wt and fully restored by expression (wt 9.4\u00b14.2%, 2.1\u00b10.7%, rescue 7.9\u00b13.4%)(Figure 24A, ratio of IFN producing cells to total Tbet expressing cells was similar among all genotypes (Figure 24D), suggesting that if a CD28ko cell expresses Tbet, it also produces IFN. This demonstrates that in CD28ko cells, differentiation is blocked at the TF, rather than at the cytokine production level. As a control, we also used non-specific restimulation with PMA and iono, which resulted in the same pattern (data not shown). Figure 23.

Collectively, our data suggested dose-dependent effects for many of the examined parameters. Therefore, we additionally performed experiments to compare these genotypes to miR1792lox, miR1792tg and heterozygous rescue mice (Figure 25). Heterozygous rescue mice are full knockout for CD28, but only express one allele of the miR-17~92 transgene (hetrescue). In these experiments, we found that again miR1792lox phenocopied CD28ko mice, which was expected from the literature [134]. Furthermore, we confirmed published data that miR1792tg mice display increased TFH differentiation. In addition to increased TFH population in relative numbers, we noted a miR-17~92 and CD28 expression dependent increase in PD-1 and ICOS upregulation in the total CD4+CD3+ population. This is presumably an effect of increased T cell activation, leading to induction of ICOS [265] as well as PD-1 expression [266]. Interestingly, heterozygous expression of the miR-17~92 transgene was sufficient to rescue TFH and GC differentiation. As for TH1 differentiation, we noted a non-significant trend that also this compartment is rescued. Results 63 Importantly, we addressed the viral clearance at day eight post infection in lung, liver, kidney and spleen [267]. Viral clearance was not affected by CD28 deficiency or miR-17~92 transgenic expression and the virus was fully cleared in all organs of all genotypes. This is consistent with literature that showed that viral clearance at this time point is CD8 mediated and CD28 independent [268]. Thus, we excluded viral clearance as a possible confounding factor. Taken together, we concluded that also in vivo transgenic miR-17~92 expression rescues known defects of CD28ko cells, namely TFH and GC B cell differentiation. While homozygous expression of the transgene rescued TFH and GC as well as TH1 formation, heterozygous expression was also sufficient for the rescue of TFH and GC B cells but not for TH1 formation.

Transgenic miR-17~92 expression rescue effect is CD4+ T cell intrinsic Due to the nature of T cell development, also the CD8+ T cells in our rescue mice express the miR-17~92 transgene, which raised the question if our rescue effect was actually CD4+ T cell intrinsic. This was unlikely since CD28 signaling was shown to be dispensable for CD8+ T cells during LCMV infection [268], however, we performed adoptive cell transfer experiments to exclude any external influence. For this, we crossed the B6.CD4cre.Rosa26loxSTOPloxCAG-miR-17~92.CD28ko strain additionally to SMARTA TCR transgenic mice. This mouse line expresses an MHC class II restricted TCR with specificity for LCMV-GP, which consists of V2/V8.3. We isolated na\u00efve CD4+ T cells from SMARTA+wt, SMARTA+CD28ko, and SMARTA+rescue mice and adoptively transferred them into CD28ko host mice. Two days later the recipient mice were infected with LCMV Armstrong, and their mesenteric LN, peripheral LN and spleen were analyzed eight days post infection. Since our donor- and recipient strain express the same congenic markers, we decided to stain for V2+V8.3+ CD4+ T cells to identify the donor cells. However, this has the caveat that also recipient cells will be contained in the gate that naturally express this combination of - and TCR chain and might expand upon LCMV infection. Therefore, we included a non-transferred mouse to display the intrinsic V2+V8.3+ population, which is shown as dotted line in the plots. The cell-intrinsic V2+V8.3+ population was negligibly small in comparison to mice receiving donor cells. In peripheral LN, we found less CD28ko V2+V8.3+ CD4+ T cells as compared to wt (Figure 26A). This was rescued by transgenic miR-17~92 expression in percentage and also absolute numbers (%V2+V8.3+ in 8.4*105\u00b15.0*105). in wt 63.4\u00b110.1%, CD28ko 26B and C) as in the peripheral LN. The presence of less V2+V8.3+ CD28ko cells suggested that CD28ko donor cells either had a proliferation- or a survival defect, which could be rescued by miR-17~92 expression. This goes in line with previously published literature showing the importance of miR-17~92 for survival and proliferation of T cells [134, 208]. Figure 26. Less CD28ko V2+V8.3+ CD4+ T cells are found in recipient mice. Na\u00efve SMARTA+ CD4+ T cells from six weeks old donor mice were transferred into CD28ko hosts i.v.. These were infected at day two post transfer with 2*105 PFU LCMV Armstrong i.p.. peripheral LN (A), spleen (B) and mesenteric LN (C) were analyzed at day eight post infection.

Data represent two independent experiments with four mice per group. Since our previous experiments had shown a defect in CD44 upregulation in CD28ko cells in vitro (see Figure 17B) as well as in vivo (see Figure 22), we hypothesized that proliferation might not be the only defect that CD28ko donor cells have in this system. We stained viable CD4+V2+V8.3+ cells of peripheral LN for their CD44 expression (Figure 27A), and found that CD28ko V2+V8.3+ cells expressed less CD44 as Results 67 compared to wt V2+V8.3+ cells, which could be rescued by transgenic miR-17~92 expression in percentage and also total numbers (%CD44hi in wt 98.7\u00b10.2 8.1*105\u00b15.0*105). Again, this pattern was found in peripheral LN, but also in spleen (%CD44hi in wt 6.3*105\u00b11.8*105) (Figure 27C). This suggested that there are not only fewer donor CD28ko cells present, they are also not as activated as their wt or rescue counterparts. Thus, these data unequivocally demonstrate that the rescue effect was cell intrinsic. Figure 27.

Results 68 6.3. Molecular mechanism of the rescue effect 6.3.1. miR-17~92 expression shapes the transcriptome during T cell activation We observed a strong effect of miR-17~92 expression on the T cell activation process. Therefore, we set out to determine the target genes of the miRNA cluster mediating this effect. Multiple targets for each member of the cluster were previously identified and validated (see section 3.2.3.3). Of note, limitation in expression of a target gene to one allele often led to a partial rescue of the corresponding miRNA knockout, e.g. Ror limitation in miR1792lox cells during TFH differentiation [134]. However, each of these publications investigated a different time point, in different context and a different T cell subset, so that these targets might not necessarily be relevant for our setting. Moreover, there might be additional, so far unknown target genes that mediate the rescue effect. Importantly, this does not exclude that previously reported target genes are also repressed in our system, since miRNAs are known to act on multiple target genes simultaneously. We stimulated na\u00efve CD4+ T cells from miR1792lox, wt and miR1792tg mice for 24h or 48h and isolated total RNA for sequencing. A PCA (Figure 28A) showed that the highest proportion of variance was caused by the process of activation itself (principal component 1 (PC1), explaining 80.3% of the variance). The second PC separated the activation time points 24h and 48h (PC2 9.5% of the variance), and the third PC separated the three genotypes (PC3, 3.6% of the na\u00efve miR1792lox and wt cells was very similar (largely overlapping in the PCA plot, even on PC3), and only 40 genes were down- and 75 upregulated in the comparison between miR1792tg to wt (at 1% FDR, also see Figure 28C, top block). This was consistent with our in vitro experimental data, and suggests that the cluster is functionally less relevant for na\u00efve cells. At 24h post activation, 216 genes were down- and 262 upregulated in the direct comparison of miR1792tg vs. miR1792lox cells (Figure 28C, middle block). At 48h, the total number of differentially expressed genes between miR1792tg and miR1792lox increased to 625 down- and 459 upregulated, and the relative changes in expression of the genes (more intense red- or blue shading) that had already been differentially expressed at 24h were increased. Direct targets of the miRNA cluster are expected to get down-Results 69 regulated in their expression upon miRNA targeting (negative correlation of miRNA expression and target). A positive correlation of miRNA with gene expression suggests that these genes are indirectly regulated, e.g. genes whose expression is regulated by an inhibitor which is targeted by miR-17~92. From this first analysis we concluded that differences in miR-17~92 expression during activation shape the transcriptome of CD4+ T cells. Our next aim was therefore to further characterize these differences in transcriptome and possibly define a mechanism which mediates these differences. Figure 28. Differences in the transcriptome between miR1792lox, wt and miR1792tg cells Na\u00efve CD4+ T cells from (grey), miR1792tg (light blue) or cre negative littermates (wt, black) were activated for 0, 24h and 48h.

The heatmap displays the centered log of read counts per million read mapped (CPM), with blue indicating lower and red indicating higher expression. Top block: na\u00efve samples, Middle: 24h Cytokine and TF expression of different TH subsets are promoted by miR-17~92 expression We performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) with our RNA-sequencing data in order to find pathways of genes that are regulated by miR-17~92 expression. We found an enrichment of gene sets that were associated with cytokine expression (Table 2) in the top 25 most significantly enriched gene sets. Considering our in vitro Results 70 data (see also section 6.2.2), we then plotted known lineage-defining TF and cytokine genes of TH subsets that were rescued by transgenic miR-17~92 expression and found that TH1 as well as TH2 and TH17 cytokine expression was increased in miR1792tg cells (Figure 29). This argued that miR-17~92 controls a master regulatory pathway that is relevant for the differentiation of all of these TH subsets. One pathway that matches these criteria is the calcineurin-NFAT axis [128], and indeed, most of these genes had a binding site for NFAT in their promoter region. We therefore aimed for defining a list of bona fide target genes, and within this list finding candidate genes that might negatively regulate an inhibitor of the NFAT pathway. Figure 29. Expression of lineage defining TFs and cytokines in different TH subsets are promoted by increased miR-17~92 expression. miR1792lox (grey), wt (cre negative, black) and miR1792tg (blue) CD4+ T cells are compared at time points 0 (left), 24h (middle) and 48h (right) after activation in their expression of selected lineage defining cytokine and TF expression of TH1, TH2, TH17 and Treg lineages. + indicate which of these genes are bound by NFAT in their promoter region [128] Results 71 Table 2.

As opposed to this, changes in gene expression at 48h might also result from changes in the 24h time point as indirect effects. In the 24h data set, we wanted to specifically look at genes whose mRNA 3'UTR are bound by Ago2, i.e., genes that are targeted for degradation by the RISC complex after being bound by a microRNA (see section 3.2.2) at the moment of harvest. The High-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS CLIP) technique provides exactly this kind of biochemical evidence since a specific protein [269], in this case Ago2, is used for immunoprecipitation of the RNA of interest prior to sequencing. For our analysis, we took advantage of an Ago2-HITS CLIP (AHC) RNA sequencing data set from collaborators in Mark Ansel's group at the University of California, San Francisco. We defined the following criteria for bona fide target genes: a) conserved seed match for at least one member of the miRNA cluster, according to the miRNA targets database TargetScan [270]. b) Coverage of more than 5 reads in the AHC data (AHC>5) The subsetting of genes with AHC and TargetScan reduced the list of in total 12'625 genes that were detected in the sequencing to several hundred potential target genes per seed family, i.e. 532 for the miR-17 seed family, 98 for the miR-18 seed family, 488 for the miR-19 seed family and 379 for the miR-92 seed family (Figure 30). Of note, with the above criteria we might miss some genuine target genes. For example, we exclude the non-canonical targets detected in the Ago2-HITS CLIP, namely those without seed match to one of the cluster members. These are also target genes, but we mainly aim at strongly enriching our candidate list for bona fide canonical target genes. Results 73 Figure 30. Venn diagrams illustrating the criteria used to identify canonical target genes of each seed family of the miR-17~92 cluster. Number outside circles: genes that do not fulfill any of the criteria, white circle: genes with a seed match in their 3' UTR, grey circle: genes with a conserved binding site according to TargetScan (TS), blue circle: genes that showed a coverage of more than 5 reads in the AHC. Of note, non-canonical targets are likely present among genes without seed match (darkest part of blue circle). We used cumulative distribution function (CDF) plots to verify whether we enrich for canonical target genes (Figure 31). For each seed family (see section 3.2.3.1), we visualize the distribution of logFC in comparisons across genotypes (miR1792lox vs. wt and miR1792tg vs. wt) for genes with a conserved seed sequence according to TargetScan (red curve) as well as the combination of the AHC and TargetScan criteria (blue curve), relative to genes without seed match and less than five AHC reads (black curve). We furthermore included miR-21 as a negative control, a miRNA which is induced upon T cell activation [271] independently from miR-17~92 and therefore its target genes should not display expression differences across genotypes (Figure 31A). If we enrich for real targets with these criteria, we expect the gene set to shift in the distribution of logFC towards higher FC in the miR1792lox vs. wt comparison and lower FC in the miR1792tg vs. wt comparison. We looked at all four seed families (see section 3.2.3.1) separately: for the miR-17 seed family, there was no clear shift in the distribution of logFC from the comparison between na\u00efve miR1792lox and wt cells for putative target gene sets (red and blue curves), relative to the control genes (black curve). However, we observed reduced log2FC in miR1792tg vs wt na\u00efve and activated samples, and increased log2FC in activated miR1792lox and wt cells (Figure 31B). A similar, but weaker shifting was observed in the miR-19 (Figure 31D) and miR-92 (Figure 31E) seed families. Of note, for the target genes of miR-18 (Figure 31C), the shift was overall minor. Considering also the relatively low number of genes identified Results 74 Figure 31. Up- and downregulation of canonical targets of different seed families of the miR-17~92 cluster. 0.00.20.40.60.81.0 1.51.00.50.00.51.01.50.00.20.40.60.81.0 1.51.00.50.00.51.01.5No seed miR-19 seed familyE miR-92 seed familylog2(FC)Cumulative fractionResults 75 with our selection criteria, this might indicate that miR-18 has no or only few target genes in this setting. Additionally, the processing of the different members of the miRNA might be time- and context dependent, which had also been reported before [237]. Importantly, for the target genes of miR-21a (Figure 31A), we did not observe any shift. From this analysis we concluded that our criteria did enrich for canonical target genes of different miRNAs of the miR-17~92 cluster, and that many of them are differentially expressed in this setting. Thus, to reduce the candidate list further for experimental validation, we included additional criteria like the exon-intron split analysis (EISA, [272]). This was especially important because of differences in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation: changes in transcriptional activity will be reflected by a change in intron as well as exon expression due to an increase in pre-mRNA, which is mostly nuclear RNA. In contrast to this, genes which are post-transcriptionally repressed by miRNAs should change their exon expression. Therefore, the log2FC in introns and exons is plotted (illustrated as an example for miR-17 seed family in Figure 32) to visualize which genes Genes of distinct seed families of miR-17~92 show similar behavior, except for the miR-18 seed family. miR-21a was used as a control miRNA. black curve: all genes of our data set that do not have a seed match and showed five or less AHC reads, red: subset of genes that has a seed sequence for the indicated seed family, blue: subset of genes that has a seed sequence for the indicated seed family plus did also show more than five reads in the AHC Figure 32. Illustration of the intronic vs exonic expression fold change criteria Illustration shows the comparison of 24h activated miR1792tg vs wt cells, focused on miR-17 seed family. Bona fide target genes should only change at exonic level, indicating that the mature, spliced mRNA is changed in abundance (shift down in comparison to the red diagonal). A) 3'UTR seed match genes have a miR-17 seed family seed sequence (orange dots), B) TargetScan genes have a conserved miR-17 seed family seed sequence (red dots), C) AHC reads > 5 genes showed more than 5 reads in the AHC (purple dots), D) TargetScan + AHC reads > 5 match both of the latter two criteria (blue dots). Green dots mark the genes that are differentially expressed Results 76 change post-transcriptionally only [272] (shift down in this example, since we look at the comparison miR1792tg vs. wt in 24h activated cells). Additionally, we wanted to focus on genes which are significantly differentially expressed in the absence of miR-17~92 as well as in the overexpressing cells in comparison to wt. For direct targets, the expression should be increased in miR1792lox, but decreased in miR1792tg cells. This results in the following three additional criteria for bona fide canonical targets: c) differential expression (FDR < 0.01) in both lox vs. wt and tg vs. wt comparisons at 24h, log2FC > 0 in lox vs. wt and log2FC < 0 in tg vs. wt comparisons at 24h, e) no differential expression of introns (see Figure 32) (FDR >= 0.01) in both lox vs. wt and tg vs. wt comparisons at 24h. With these criteria we result in the final canonical target candidate gene list of 125 genes shown in Table 3. Of note, this list includes targets of all four seed families, and some candidates are targeted by multiple miRNAs of the cluster. Table 3.

These genes have been validated by others and serve as a positive control for our analysis. 6.3.4. Exogenous miR-17~92 expression partially rescues the transcriptome of CD28ko cells Since we observed a rather strong rescue effect on different aspects of T cell activation and differentiation (see section 6.2), we wondered if this rescue was only phenotypical or if the transgenic miR-17~92 expression might also rescue the transcriptome of CD28ko cells. Following this hypothesis, we isolated RNA from na\u00efve and 24h activated CD4+ T cells from CD28ko, wt, rescue, miR1792tg and miR1792lox mice to perform RNA sequencing again. In a PCA analysis, most of the variance was again explained by T cell activation (PC1 (90.7%)). PC2 (2.4%) separated the different genotypes, a pattern that was more apparent in activated samples, and while the miR1792lox, wt and miR1792tg genotypes did not separate clearly, the CD28ko samples were very different from the others. This was expected, since CD28 co-stimulation is known to have profound effects on the transcriptome during early T cell activation [273]. Strikingly, the overexpression of miR-17~92 in CD28ko cells partially rescued the transcriptome so that the rescue samples were more similar to miR1792lox/wt/miR1792tg (Figure 33). According to our hypothesis that miR-17~92 promotes T cell activation, we expect \"two extremes of activation\": the \"super activated\" miR1792tg cells and the \"improperly activated\" cells. This was confirmed by this PCA analysis: miR1792tg were the most different from CD28ko samples. Results 80 Figure 33. Exogenous miR-17~92 expression partially rescues CD28ko transcriptome during CD4+ T activation Na\u00efve CD4+ T cells from miR1792lox (grey), miR1792tg (light blue), cre negative littermates (wt, black), CD28ko (purple), and rescue cells (dark blue) were activated for 24h, total RNA was extracted for bulk sequencing. PCA analysis was based on the 25% most variable genes of the dataset. The PCA analysis however suggested that the transcriptome differences between CD28ko and wt samples can only partially be rescued by forced miR-17~92 expression, at least until this time point in this context. We hypothesized that the rescued part of the transcriptome was including miR-17~92 targets and investigated our dataset like before (Figure 30 and Figure 31): We verified the log FC shifts in the comparisons across genotypes in activated cells for gene subsets with conserved binding sites according to TargetScan and with AHC data coverage. Additionally, we added in this analysis the list of bona fide canonical target genes that we had defined in the previous section as a new subset (green curve in Figure 34; these genes are by definition regulated by miR-17~92 expression). Similar to the shift towards increased FC in miR1792lox vs. wt (Figure 31), the FC of the same genes were also shifted to increased FC in CD28ko vs. wt (Figure 34, top row). This suggests that the genes that are repressed by miR-17~92 and therefore up-regulated upon miR-17~92 inactivation in activated cells were also up-regulated in CD28-deficient cells during activation. This shift mostly was reversed with transgenic expression of miR-17~92 in rescue cells (Figure 34, bottom row). Even more, the expression of the most relevant putative target genes (Table 3, green curve in Figure 34) was over compensated, so that the FC became even negative. From this analysis we concluded that a fraction of genes that are differentially expressed in the CD28ko transcriptome is regulated by miR-17~92. Results 81 Therefore, the exogenous expression of miR-17~92 led to a partial rescue of the CD28ko transcriptome in rescue cells. Figure 34. Bona fide canonical targets of miR-17~92 are also regulated by CD28 Genome-wide transcriptome analysis, presented as the log2 value of the gene-expression ratio for each gene versus the cumulative fraction of all log2 ratios.

Target gene RCAN3 expression is dependent on CD28 or miR-17~92 expression Since cytokine expression was promoted by increased miR-17~92 expression (Figure 29), and NFAT is a common regulator of most of these, we searched in our target gene list (Table 3) for candidates that might negatively regulate the calcineurin-NFAT pathway. One such candidate gene is Regulator of calcineurin 3 (RCAN3), which was reported to interact with and thereby inhibit calcineurin [112]. Results 82 We used published HITS-CLIP data [274] to investigate if the 3'UTR of our selected target candidate gene RCAN3 in this setting. The activation conditions of this published data set were not exactly the same as in our situation (longer activation), however they should still be within acceptable range of difference. The visualization showed that there are multiple binding sites for different miRNAs in the 3'UTR of RCAN3, though only the miR-17 binding site was occupied by Ago2 at the moment of sequencing (Figure 35), suggesting that this is a true target gene. Figure 35. Visualization of RCAN3 3'UTR: AHC track. Binding sites of Ago2 in 3'UTR of RCAN3 detected by HITS-CLIP (orange and red peaks), yellow flags and grey bars indicate potential binding sites for miRNA The second RNA sequencing dataset showed a ~0.5-fold in expression of RCAN3 RNA in CD28ko cells in comparison to wt. We then performed qPCR on RNA that we extracted from 24h activated miR1792lox, wt and miR1792tg cells to validate the results. RCAN3 mRNA expression was ~1.5-fold increased in miR1792lox as compared to wt cells, and ~0.6-fold reduced in miR1792tg as compared to wt (Figure 36A). The regulation of the mRNA is the first important aspect of target validation, but the translation into protein is of even greater importance. We therefore set out to test if RCAN3 protein abundance is also regulated. Since no antibody for FACS and no good antibody for WesternBlot was available for RCAN3, we performed targeted proteomics in order to address protein expression. RCAN3 protein expression was ~2-fold increased in CD28ko and miR1792lox cells in comparison to wt, which was reduced by transgenic miR-17~92 expression in the rescue cells (Figure 36B). However, even if RNA expression in miR1792tg cells was decreased in comparison to Results 83 wt cells, protein was not significantly changed (normalized protein abundance in CD28ko this data, we concluded that RCAN3 RNA as well as protein expression is regulated by CD28 and miR-17~92.

Sensitivity to Cyclosporin A is increased in CD28 deficient cells and rescued by transgenic miR-17~92 expression Our data on RCAN3 RNA and protein expression suggested the hypothesis that one so far unknown way of how miR-17~92 acts in T cell activation might be the regulation of calcineurin and NFAT via the inhibition of a cell-intrinsic calcineurin RCAN3. We hypothesized that increased RCAN3 expression in CD28ko cells might increase the sensitivity of the cells to the chemical calcineurin inhibitor CsA. To test this hypothesis, we activated wt, CD28ko and rescue CD4+ T cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of CsA for 48h. As already shown in Figure 17, all genotypes reached similar percentages of CD25+CD69+ expression. With increasing CsA concentrations, CD28ko cells showed reduced percentages of CD25+CD69+ expression in comparison to wt already at a concentration 6.25ng/ml (Figure 37A). Wt cells only reacted at a 4-fold higher concentration, while rescue cells were even more resistant than wt cells. The failure of early activation marker upregulation went in hand with Results 84 differences in cell size: at 6.25ng/ml CsA, CD28ko cells were almost not blasting at all, wt cells were blasting, and rescue cells looked normal, which is shown as FSC-A in Figure 37B. This indicated a higher sensitivity to CsA for CD28ko cells, which could be rescued by transgenic miR-17~92 expression. Figure 37. CD28ko cells react more sensitively to CsA treatment, and rescue cells are more resistant wt (black), CD28ko (purple) and rescue (dark blue) cells were activated for 48h in the presence of increasing concentrations of Cyclosporin A (CsA) as indicated and stained for their expression of CD25 and CD69.

B) Representative example of the influence of 6.25ng/ml CsA on blasting (FSC-A of the lymphocyte gate) of viable CD4+ cells. The main mode of action of calcineurin inhibitors is to prevent nuclear localization of NFAT by inhibition of the phosphatase activity of calcineurin [275]. We therefore investigated nuclear localization of NFATc2 by ImageStream: again, CD4+ T cells were activated in the presence of 6.25ng/ml CsA. The acquisition showed small cells with most of the NFATc2 signal in the cytoplasm (Figure 38A, top row) and big cells in which the NFATc2 signal co-localized with the DAPI signal (Figure 38A, bottom row). The histogram of the similarity dilate, a value used to score co-localization of signals, indicates that at a concentration of 6.25ng/ml CsA in culture, CD28ko cells show less nuclear localization of NFATc2 as compared to wt and rescue cells (Figure 38B). Results 85 Figure 38.

B) ImageStream data: histogram of the similarity dilate for each sample, indicative of the co-localization of NFATc2 and DAPI signal, gates indicate the translocated population (high similarity dilate) and the non-translocated population (low similarity dilate) With this, we concluded that CD28ko cells are more sensitive to CsA as compared to wt cells, which is rescued by transgenic miR-17~92 expression in CD28ko cells. We suggest that this happens via a so far unknown mechanism, which is the promotion of calcineurin activity via regulation of the natural calcineurin inhibitor RCAN3. As this is an essential aspect of immune suppression, our work suggests new possibilities for immunosuppressive medication but also cellular immune therapies. Discussion 86 7. Discussion The importance of miR-17~92 expression for the function of CD4+ T cells has been established by independent research groups for different TH subsets and models [134, 208, 216, 234-237, 240]. Although some of these reports are in contrast to each other, a few key effects of miR-17~92 expression have been agreed on [227], which are mainly the amplification of cytokine expression as well as promotion of proliferation. Based on our own findings and published data [208] we hypothesized that overexpression of miR-17~92, which is normally induced with CD28 co-stimulation [215], might compensate for the co-stimulatory signal given by this receptor. Thus, we elucidated if transgenic miR-17~92 expression compensates for CD28 signaling in CD4+ T cell activation in vitro and in vivo. This concept was also suggested by Benhamou et al. [276] who could show that activation of B cells partially depends on PI3K activity, which is initiated by the co-stimulatory signal given by CD19 in this case. Similar to CD28ko T cells, CD19ko B cells are deficient in activation, proliferation and differentiation. Benhamou et al. showed that the artificial expression of miR-17~92 in B cells can partially compensate for CD19 deficiency [41]. Moreover, the authors investigated the role of a known miR-17~92 target, PTEN [277], which restricts the CD19-PI3K axis. They demonstrate an autostimulatory axis of c-Myc/miR-17~92/PTEN which regulates PI3K mediated positive and negative selection. However, other pathways than PI3K or other targets remain obscure in this publication. PTEN was also shown to be an important miR-17~92 target in T cells, though Baumjohann et al. showed that limitation of PTEN expression to one allele alone could not restore the phenotype of miR1792lox mice in TFH differentiation [134], which strongly suggests that other targets must be regulated in this setting as well. Many different targets for all members of the miR-17~92 cluster have been validated so far [227, 228]. We identify a new list of bona fide canonical target genes in our setting, which are not only regulated by miR-17~92 but also by CD28 expression. Importantly, by showing that the overexpression of miR-17~92 rescued the expression of these genes, we also provide evidence that the rescue is not only a phenotypic effect, but also manifested in the transcriptome and most likely mediated by bona fide canonical targets. This Discussion 87 demonstrates that during activation of CD4+ T cells with CD28 co-stimulation, which is known to induce the expression of genes, also the repression of genes is essential. We searched for pathways other than PI3K that are regulated by miR-17~92 during CD4+ T cell activation, and found that also calcineurin-NFAT axis is promoted by miR-17~92 expression. We suggest a new target for miR-17, which is the cell-intrinsic calcineurin RCAN3 calcineurin activity, consequently leading to increased NFAT activity, with marked consequences for cell fate. 7.1. miR-17~92 expression promotes CD4+ T cell activation Baumjohann et al. showed that reduced miR-17~92 expression decreases proliferation in vitro [134], while Xiao et al. showed increased proliferation due to miR-17~92 overexpression [231]. Moreover, previous literature suggests that also cytokine expression is decreased in the absence of miR-17~92 expression, and increased in the case of miR-17~92 overexpression [231]. Here, we show that IL-2 production and secretion as well as proliferation are proportional to miR-17~92 expression. Of note, differences in miR1792lox vs wt as well as miR1792tg vs wt are relatively small, which reflects the general problem of subtle changes in miRNA studies. Usually, large number of samples are required to reach significant differences [278]. This is also partially caused by the paralogue clusters whose expression is unchanged in these mouse models, and their function which is partially redundant to miR-17~92 [192, 218]. From these experiments, we concluded that IL-2 production and proliferation is promoted by miR-17~92 expression. These findings are in accordance with previously published literature. CD4+ T cell activation results in major changes in the CD4+ T cell's metabolism regarding glucose uptake and glycolytic activity. MiR-17~92 is involved in the regulation of c-Myc, which is an important regulator of metabolism [279]. Interestingly, we found increased glucose uptake in na\u00efve miR1792tg CD4+ T cells, but no difference in mitochondria stress tests. This suggests that glucose uptake is promoted by miR-17~92 expression, however it is not metabolized by glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation. This shows that na\u00efve miR1792tg CD4+ T cells metabolically do not resemble more activated cells, which contradicts the hypothesis that Discussion 88 transgenic miR-17~92 expression leads to some kind of metabolic checkpoint passage. We could probably argue that this is expected since miR-17~92 expression is usually only induced during CD4+ T cell activation [215] and target genes might not be expressed in the na\u00efve setting. In activated CD4+ T cells, miR-17~92 expression correlates with metabolic activity. However, we suppose that this results from higher activation the more miRNA cluster is expressed as suggested already by our previous experiments. In order to get a deeper insight into the metabolic phenotype of activated CD4+ T cell cells of different miR-17~92 expression, we performed a metabolomics analysis on activated CD4+ T cell lysates. There we found only eight metabolites which were differentially abundant in the direct comparison of miR1792tg to miR1792lox cells. Moreover, these metabolites belonged to distinct pathways and FC were just above cut-off, which raised the question if the detected differences are biologically relevant. We investigated our RNA sequencing results for the same pathways, which did not reveal patterns of pathways being repressed or promoted by miR-17~92 expression. With these results we could not confirm, nor neglect, the hypothesis of metabolic checkpoint allowance by miR-17~92 expression during CD4+ T cell activation. From this first part of the thesis, we concluded that miR-17~92 expression directly correlates with CD4+ T cell activation, including IL-2 production as well as proliferation and metabolic activity. Notably, the differences relative to wt in these experiments were sometimes subtle, which provokes the question of biological significance. Blevins et al. suggested that the role of miRNAs is more the regulation of cell-to-cell variability than active meaningful changes in cell phenotype [186]. Thus, upregulation of miR-17~92 expression regulates genes which are also upregulated during activation in feedback loops. However, the significance of the differences introduced by miRNAs have been extensively debated in the past (reviewed e.g. in [278]): with the regulation of genes close to specific threshold levels, miRNAs might, even if introducing only small changes in target gene expression, also mediate important on-off switches. Since CD4+ T cell activation is a very dynamic process of parallel changes in expression of surface molecules as well as intracellular proteins, we hypothesized that miR-17~92 is a key player in CD28 dependent activation. Discussion 89 7.2. Exogenous miR-17~92 expression rescues CD28 deficiency 7.2.1. Exogenous miR-17~92 expression compensates for CD28 signal during in vitro activation Different key aspects of CD4+ T cell activation were shown to be regulated by CD28 as well as miR-17~92 expression. Xiao et al. showed that miR1792tg cells proliferate better than wt cells when stimulated with CD3 alone [231]. Therefore, we expected from our B6.CD4cre.Rosa26loxSTOPloxCAG-miR-17~92.CD28ko (rescue) mouse model that proliferation and other aspects of CD4+ T cell activation are restored by exogenous miR-17~92 expression. We found that IL-2 production in rescue cells was not only rescued to the wt amount, but even higher as compared to wt cells. One explanation for this supraphysiologic rescue might be that with transgenic expression, more miR-17~92 expression is achieved than during activation of wt cells. Since miR-17~92 was shown to promote PI3K dependent pathways, the PI3K dependent aspect of IL-2 production, which is IL-2 transcription [162], might be over-compensated. Moreover, this assay stimulation. Iono Ca2+ influx [280] while PMA acts on Ras [281], both resulting in increased IL-2 production. Thus, we might look at Ca2+ dependent pathways that could be promoted by transgenic miR-17~92 expression. As expected from the literature [231], proliferation and blasting was rescued by transgenic miR-17~92 expression. More surprising to us was that all genotypes induced CD25 and CD69 expression: CD25 was previously shown be CD28 dependent [282] while CD69 was not [117]. Investigation of the MFI revealed that CD69 is actually unchanged, while CD25 MFI depends on CD28 or miR-17~92 expression. One explanation for this might be that exogenous IL-2 was present in the culture, which might lead to CD25 induction [283]. The differences that we observe in MFI might then originate from autocrine IL-2 stimulation. The differences in CD44hiCD62Llo populations were expected since we had shown in previous experiments that activation is rescued by exogenous miR-17~92 expression. However, defects in CD44 expression of CD28ko cells had not been described before. Discussion 90 These experiments demonstrated that exogenous miR-17~92 expression can indeed compensate for CD28 signaling during in vitro activation of CD4+ T cells in terms of IL-2 production, proliferation and surface marker upregulation similar to what Benhamou et al. had reported for CD19 deficient B cells. 7.2.2. Exogenous miR-17~92 expression compensates for CD28 deficiency during in vitro differentiation After encountering an antigen in a specific context (e.g. cytokine milieu) during an infection, the CD4+ T cell fate changes according to extracellular signals. The networks of master regulators, STAT proteins and cytokines in TH differentiation are complex: Lineage fates influence each other by repression of TFs or interaction between master regulators. However, these networks are also partially redundant, with the consequence that differentiation is possible even if single players of the networks are absent [284]. For example, Usui et al. reported that Tbet is not absolutely essential for IFN production as long as IL-4 signals are blocked [285]. miRNAs were shown to influence differentiation of subsets e.g. by targeting TFs [134], therefore we expected an influence on differentiation of rescue cells as well. We observed that TH1 differentiation was delayed for Tbet production in CD28ko cells and rescued by exogenous miR-17~92 expression. IFN production was massively increased by exogenous miR-17~92 expression, which might be explained by the fact that STAT5, a signaling molecule downstream of IL-2R, regulates IFN locus availability [94, 286], and we showed that IL-2 production is increased with miR-17~92 expression. In this case, on one hand cell-intrinsic IL-2 production might promote IFN production in rescue cells, but additionally reduced expression of CD25 in CD28ko cells as seen in previous experiments might reduce signaling from IL-2 contained in the culture. Rort expression was impaired in CD28ko cells as compared to wt during TH17 differentiation, and exogenous miR-17~92 expression led to a rescue, even though with different kinetics in Rort induction as compared to wt. Moreover, miR1792tg cells even expressed less Rort than wt at 24h post induction, while later on miR1792tg and wt were indistinguishable. IL-17A production was reduced in CD28ko Discussion 91 cells, and only partially rescued by exogenous miR-17~92 expression. MiR1792tg cells also were delayed in their IL-17A production as compared to wt. The data for CD28ko cells looks like contrast to published literature which showed that CD28 co-stimulation actually inhibits in vitro generation of IL-17A producing cells [165]. Of note, Bouguermouh et al. stain their cells at day four or five (other than our experiments which end on day three) after six hours of PMA/Iono restimulation. Moreover, in their publication most of the experiments were conducted without the addition of neutralizing antibodies for IL-2 and IFN. However, the authors also include one experiment where they added these antibodies, with the result that IL-17A production was similar between CD28ko and wt cells. They therefore claim that CD28 inhibits TH17 differentiation by promoting IL-2 and IFN. This means that this publication is actually not necessarily in contrast to our experiments, since we included neutralizing antibodies in our culture, and we observed a delay in IL-17A expression induction in CD28ko cells. The data on rescue and miR1792tg cells argues for a complex network of regulatory mechanisms which are partially influenced by miR-17~92 in a timing-dependent manner. One possible explanation for this phenotype might be that not all members of the miR-17~92 cluster promote the same differentiation processes: Montoya et al. showed that miR-18a has an inhibitory effect on TH17 development [237], while miR-17 family members promoted cytokine production. This indicates that different TH17 inhibitory- and promoting mechanisms are happening at the same time and sequentially after each other in this setting, resulting in a mixed, timing-dependent phenotype. Additionally, the Montoya et al. show that during TH17 differentiation, not all members of the cluster are regulated or processed to the same extent, resulting in differential expression of different cluster members. This suggests that during differentiation, timing of individual miRNA expression is very important, target mRNAs might be upregulated early and get repressed later, which would explain why miR1792tg cells are first delayed in Rort induction but later on produce more IL-17A than wt. Our observation at 24h suggests that excess miR-17~92 expression is inhibitory for TH17 differentiation in early stages (which is consistent with the findings from Montoya at al.). However, at a later time point, the miR-17~92 is needed to some extent since miR-17~92 expression does rescue parts of the CD28ko phenotype. Of note, this is not necessarily in contrast to Discussion 92 what Montoya et al. showed, since they investigated day 3.5 post differentiation, which might be regulated by a different interplay of miRNAs and targets again. Surprisingly, we observed reduced differentiation into iTreg cells in CD28ko cells and complete rescue by exogenous miR-17~92 expression. This was unexpected because so far, miR-17~92 was reported to inhibit iTreg differentiation [208]. Several differences in the experimental procedure might explain for this discrepancy: first of all, the time point of harvest by Jiang et al. was at day six (other than day one to three in our experiment). Second, they only used 50U/ml of IL-2 during their culture, which is 5-fold less than what we use for iTreg differentiation. Additionally, the amount of CD28/CD3, which is not indicated in their publication, might change the relevance of miR-17~92 cluster expression during the experiment [134]. Moreover, strong CD28 signals were shown to inhibit [287]. Assuming that miR-17~92 amplifies CD28 signaling, co-stimulation with higher concentrations than in our setting might therefore lead to different experimental outcomes. Of note, at 72h post induction also viability was impaired in CD28ko samples of TH17 and iTreg differentiation, which was expected from the literature since CD28 was shown to induce pro-survival gene B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-XL)[288]. Interestingly, exogenous miR-17~92 partially rescued viability during in vitro differentiation. To look into this, we used our second RNA sequencing set, for which we had extracted RNA from 24h activated wt, CD28ko, rescue, miR1792tg and miR1792lox cells (see section 6.3.4). Of note, other than the in vitro differentiation, these cells are only activated but not skewed into a specific subset. We confirmed with RNA sequencing data that Bcl-XL expression is indeed reduced in CD28ko as compared to wt during CD4+ T cell activation, but partially rescued upon exogenous miR-17~92 expression, which fits previous literature showing a beneficial effect of miR-17~92 expression on survival [208]. However, miR1792tg cells showed similar viability as wt cells, and Bcl-XL expression is similar. This suggests that an expression threshold of Bcl-XL might be achieved by natural miR-17~92 induction in activated wt cells, so that additional miR-17~92 from the transgene does not further increase Bcl-XL expression. Overall, these in vitro differentiation assays led to the conclusion that also for complex processes like TH subset differentiation, exogenous miR-17~92 expression rescues Discussion 93 CD28 deficiency. Of note, the extent of rescue is time- and subset dependent, but in all subsets a rescue could be observed. This suggests that different targets are regulating processes of CD4+ T cell differentiation, and all of them have their individual contribution, which emphasizes the need for the identification of miR-17~92 targets. Moreover, since all subsets were affected, this also implied that there might be targets that are common among distinct TH subsets 7.2.3. Exogenous miR-17~92 expression rescues CD28 deficiency in CD4+ T cells in vivo The importance of CD28 as well as miR-17~92 expression for TFH and germinal center differentiation has been established [134, 140, 216]. Additionally, CD44 was shown to positively correlate with miR-17~92 expression during acute viral infection [134, 216]. Similar to our in vitro results and in accordance to this literature, CD44 is reduced in CD28ko cells as compared to wt, and rescued upon exogenous miR-17~92 expression. If CD44 is a \"side-effect\" or active contributor to the enhanced activation cannot be decided at this point: CD44 cannot induce proliferation of CD4+ T cells, but it was reported to promote Lck and Fyn, suggesting an influence on T cell activation [289, 290]. As expected from the literature, TFH (CD3+CD4+CXCR5+Bcl-6+ICOS+PD-1+) and GC B cells (CD19+B220+Fas+GL7+) are reduced in CD28ko as compared to wt mice [140] in our experiments. Exogenous miR-17~92 expression restored both TFH as well as GC populations. The development of GC B cells suggests for a functional TFH differentiation. This raises the question whether miR-17~92 consequently also rescues the functionality of GC B cells. Additional experiments to test this would be to investigate the antibody repertoire for isotype switch and specificity, as well as cytokine secretion, e.g. IL-21. Especially, we report a strong effect of miR-17~92 expression on ICOS as well as PD-1 induction. This could be interpreted as a direct consequence of CD28 signaling independent from TFH differentiation, since ICOS expression is induced on CD4+ T cells via CD28 dependent and independent pathways [149, 159]. DiToro et al. recently showed that those CD4+ T cells which produce IL-2 after activation induce Bcl-6 expression and give rise to TFH cells, while non-producers Discussion 94 are not able to differentiate to TFH [291]. Moreover, they reported that the most significantly enhanced gene sets in IL-2 producers were those of Myc and E2F family of TFs. This is especially interesting because these TFs are known to be involved in auto-regulatory loops with miR-17~92 [224, 225, 230], which might suggest that these cells express miR-17~92, promoting IL-2. This might represent another, so far unknown possibility of how miR-17~92 contributes to increased TFH differentiation. DiToro et al. further propose that their phenotype results from thresholds in T cell activation, with stronger activation leading to IL-2 production and TFH differentiation. Considering this literature, we suggest that (among other effects, like e.g. the targeting of Ror [134]) miR-17~92 enhances T cell activation with cell-intrinsic IL-2 production, which allows wt, miR1792tg and rescue cells to acquire TFH phenotype, and accordingly reduces TFH differentiation in CD28ko and miR1792lox. Other than in our in vitro experiments, IFN production was not overcompensated in the rescue cells as compared to CD28ko cells, which might be due to the more physiologic differentiation conditions in vivo, or the different time point that we investigate in this experiment. Similar to the in vitro data, also in vivo we can speculate that reduced IL-2 production in CD28ko mice leads to reduced IFN production. Moreover, for TH1 differentiation, we assume that CD44 upregulation in wt and rescue cells might enhance differentiation in this setting, since Baaten et al. reported that CD44 expression promoted TH1 effector cell survival [292]. Overall, we concluded from our experiments that also in vivo, exogenous miR-17~92 expression compensates for CD28 deficiency TFH and TH1 differentiation. 7.2.4. Exogenous miR-17~92 expression rescue effect is CD4+ T cell intrinsic One caveat of our rescue mouse model is that CD4cre expression might lead to side effects in cell populations other than CD4+ T cells, raising the question if the rescue effect that we observed in our in vivo experiments was CD4+ T cell intrinsic. We found fewer V2+V8.3+ CD28ko cells in all investigated organs after adoptive transfer of SMARTA+ cells with subsequent LCMV infection. Importantly, the population was rescued by exogenous miR-17~92 expression. Again, in addition to the cell-intrinsic Discussion 95 proliferation defect which we showed in previous experiments, this effect might be mediated by IL-2: IL-2 production in recipient CD28ko mice is reduced [162], so that IL-2 produced by donor cells is needed for proper expansion. Since our in vitro experiments showed that IL-2 production is reduced in CD28ko but rescued by exogenous miR-17~92 expression, we propose that expansion might also be reduced due to low IL-2 abundance in CD28ko recipients. Moreover, V2+V8.3+ CD28ko cells were reduced in their CD44 expression as compared to wt, which was fully rescued by exogenous miR-17~92 expression. This argues that not only expansion, but also activation is diminished in CD28ko cells. Again, further experiments will be interesting to elucidate if CD44 expression is actually a consequence or a precondition for T cell differentiation at this point, and also if this is a direct or an indirect effect of miR-17~92 expression. Possible experiments to test this would be the use of CD44 blocking antibodies or, in a more laborious approach, CD44 gene targeting. So far, we concluded from these transfer experiments that the rescue effect of miR-17~92 expression was CD4+ T cell intrinsic. Moreover, as mentioned in the previous section, effects on IL-2 production could explain for some, but not all of the results. We could test this by the addition of IL-2 blocking antibodies or IL-2 injections. However, we set priority on elucidating if the rescue was phenotypic or actually mediated in the transcriptome, which on one hand might show how IL-2 is regulated by miR-17~92 but on the other hand also reveal additional pathways. Discussion 96 7.3. Molecular mechanism of the rescue effect Many targets for miR-17~92 have been described and validated so far, among them might also contribute to our phenotype, explaining for the effect of miR-17~92 on T cell activation. Most likely, multiple targets cooperate in their function, resulting in a complex network of parallel processes to synergistically amplify activation. Clearly, PI3K is established as a pathway that is promoted by miR-17~92 e.g. through repression of PTEN. However, the possibility remained that there are still unknown targets that regulate other pathways, which were not detected in previous screenings e.g. due to different experimental setup. We show that miR-17~92 expression shapes the transcriptome during CD4+ T cell activation. Importantly, changes start at 24h post activation and possibly have secondary effects so that even more genes are differentially expressed at 48h. With GSEA we detected that cytokines are promoted by miR-17~92, which in principle was known before [208, 231, 234, 235]. However, what has not been addressed before is that different cytokines can be promoted by one common pathway, which is the calcineurin-NFAT axis [128]. Of note, differences in IL-2 mRNA expression at 24h or 48h are not striking in this heatmap. This might be reasoned by different regulatory mechanisms of IL-2 production as previously mentioned, but also in different experimental conditions: ELISA at 48h was measured from culture supernatants without the addition of exogenous IL-2 at the beginning, so that intrinsic IL-2 production by each cell type might result in auto-stimulatory loops, which then amplified the differences. 7.3.1. Identification of miR-17~92 bona fide canonical target genes during activation We used stringent criteria to identify bona fide canonical target genes in our list of thousands of genes which were identified by RNA sequencing. This came at the cost of excluding target genes that might be relevant in some \"unconventional\" way. For example, with this analysis we excluded so-called non-canonical miRNA targets: the TargetScan criteria only allows conserved perfect seed matches. However, miRNAs Discussion 97 were shown to also bind to RNA with bulges and wobbles, thus non-perfect seed matches. Moreover, the targeting can happen also outside the 3'UTR and in a RISC-independent manner [293]. Thus, our data set theoretically allows also for the identification of non-canonical targets, however we prioritized the canonical targets. With contrasts between activated miR1792lox and wt as well as miR1792tg and wt, we show that RISC-bound genes from each seed family are increased in their FC in the absence of miR-17~92, and also decreased in FC in miR-17~92 overexpression. Notably, distinct miRNA seed families show slightly different behavior: while miR-17 seed family members shift very clearly, the shift is less pronounced in miR-18, miR-19 and miR-92 seed families. Different explanations might account for this phenotype. First of all, the regulation of miRNA targets is context dependent so that one seed family or miRNA might be more important in a specific setting as compared to a different miRNA of the same cluster. Second, there might be less genes expressed that are targeted by a specific seed family in this setting. Third, the efficiency of targeting (i.e. resulting in a change in expression of the targeted gene) also depends on the target abundance: Mukherji et al. showed that low abundant targets can be 2-fold suppressed effectively with only one miRNA binding site, and seven binding sites reduce the target 10-fold. However, if the target is highly expressed, no matter if one or seven binding sites were present, only a 2-fold reduction was achieved [187]. With this, we can clearly say that miRNAs set thresholds in gene expression, which enables them on one hand to mediate on-off switch of genes at low target expression but also fine-tuning at high target expression. Additionally, the individual members of miR-17~92 might be differentially regulated, resulting in different abundance and consequently differential regulation of the specific target genes [216, 237]. The contrasts of na\u00efve cells were not shifted for the miR1792lox vs. wt. We might speculate from this data that miR-17~92 expression is not essential in na\u00efve CD4+ T cells, which would also fit the fact that the cluster expression is only induced upon CD28 co-stimulation [215]. Alternatively, since the literature suggests redundancy for some targets, paralogue clusters might compensate for miR-17~92 function in the na\u00efve setting [24]. Other than suggested by PCA, the CDF plot for the contrast between na\u00efve miR1792tg and wt cells shows a shift for miR-17, miR-19 and miR-92 family members, indicating that some target genes are differentially expressed in na\u00efve CD4+ T cells as Discussion 98 well. However, we focus on the analysis of genes that are differentially expressed during activation. The difference between CDF plot and PCA might originate from less restrictions in the PCA: the CDF plots focus on genes which are also detected in the AHC. Some more targets might be excluded with the EISA criterium: if a gene is regulated transcriptionally as well as post-transcriptionally, it is also excluded from our analysis. Moreover, genes that are targeted by miRNAs from paralogue clusters might not be contained in our list, since redundant function might prevent changes in the miR1792lox vs. wt situation, while there might be a significant change in the miR1792tg vs wt contrast. Any gene in the list of 125 canonical bona fide target genes might contribute to the rescue phenotype. However, this does not imply that the changes in expression of these genes introduced by miRNA in this setting are actually biologically relevant. As mentioned previously, small changes at threshold expression level might have a bigger impact as compared to larger changes at higher expression. Importantly, some of these genes also harbor multiple seed sequences for different family members, which also opens possibilities for multiple regulatory mechanisms that depending on the abundance of individual miRNAs. Another effect that we do not cover in this project is the possibility of selective avoidance, which is the shortening of the 3'UTR during activation and proliferation, leading to the loss of miRNA binding sites and therefore escape of repression in ongoing activation. In our bona fide canonical target gene list we find known and validated target genes like TGFRII [208] and PHLPP2 [216], which serve as positive controls for our analysis. Of note, we do not expect all of the \"typical\" target genes in this list since timing and experimental conditions might be different from the settings in which they were published. However, the question remained if the transcriptome of CD28ko cells was rescued by exogenous miR-17~92 expression as well, and if the genes that we identified as bona fide canonical target genes might actively contribute to the rescue. Discussion 99 7.3.2. Exogenous miR-17~92 expression partially rescues the transcriptome of CD28ko cells CD28 was shown to be an essential contributor to shaping the transcriptome during CD4+ T cell activation [273]. We confirmed these data and additionally demonstrate that exogenous miR-17~92 expression partially rescues the transcriptome of CD28ko cells. Furthermore, even if miR1792lox cells phenocopied CD28ko cells in CD4+ T cell activation, their transcriptome was markedly different. Following our hypothesis that exogenous miR-17~92 expression amplifies CD28-dependent CD4+ T cell activation, we note that miR1792tg cells (most activated) showed the biggest difference to CD28ko (least activated) cells. Importantly, the bona fide canonical target genes that we identified with the previous RNA sequencing data set were also dysregulated in the CD28ko vs. wt contrast, which argues that these genes are regulated by CD28 as well as miR-17~92. The contrast of rescue vs. wt samples shows that the same genes are also rescued in their expression FC by exogenous miR-17~92 expression. This confirms that these target genes actually do mediate the rescue that we observe phenotypically also in the transcriptome. Of note, the miR-18 seed family again shows a milder phenotype, indicating that genes which are targeted by this family are not fully rescued by exogenous miR-17~92 expression. Like before, differential expression of individual miRNAs and timing might account for this difference. Moreover, miR-18 has been reported to antagonize the function of other miR-17~92 family members [237], which might also be the case in this setting. Since also in our target gene list we only find five genes that are targeted by a miR-18 seed family member, most likely target genes of miR-18 are not as relevant in this setting as targets of other seed families. Most importantly, we conclude from this dataset that not only the CD28 signaling dependent induction of transcription contributes to CD4+ T cell activation, but also the repression of genes which is mediated by miR-17~92. This concept resembles of TH differentiation which depends on the careful co-regulation of distinct effectors [121]. Discussion 100 7.3.3. Target gene RCAN3 expression is dependent on CD28 or miR-17~92 expression As mentioned previously, the NFAT pathway is an interesting candidate to investigate for target genes since it is one common factor promoting cytokines of different TH subsets [128]. Increased NFAT activity might also explain increased expression of ICOS: an elegant study performed by Tan et al. investigated different TCR and CD28 dependent signaling molecules for their potential to induce ICOS expression. Using selective chemical inhibitors, the authors found that Fyn promotes ICOS expression via NFATc2, while MEK and Erk also induce ICOS in an independent pathway [149]. Within our list of 125 bona fide canonical target genes, we identified RCAN3, a regulator of calcineurin activity, as a target gene that might influence T cell activation by regulating NFAT. Among all different miRNA binding sites in the 3'UTR of RCAN3, only the miR-17-5p/20-5p/93-5p/106-5p site was bound to Ago2, indicating that this is the only active miRNA target site in this setting. qPCR confirms that RCAN3 mRNA is negatively correlated with miR-17~92 expression. Interestingly, RCAN3 protein abundance was increased in CD28ko and miR1792lox while wt, rescue and miR1792tg cells were comparable in their expression. This suggests that differences in mRNA abundance due to miRNA targeting translate into protein. However, it also indicates that a certain miR-17~92 expression threshold is sufficient to repress RCAN3. In CD3/CD28 activated wt cells, this is reached by natural miR-17~92 induction while exogenous miR-17~92 in rescue cells reduces RCAN3 expression. The gold standard for the ultimate validation of RCAN3 would be the interruption of the miR-17~92-RCAN3-calcineurin/NFAT pathway. Distinct approaches for this are possible, from the complete RCAN3ko to mutations in the calcineurin interaction motif or mutation of the miRNA target site. Canaider et al. successfully knocked out RCAN3 expression in HUVEC cells using small interfering RNA (siRNA) [294], which reduced proliferation. We attempted to do the same in primary CD4+ T cells, however in our setting we could not measure an impact of RCAN3 siRNA on any of our parameters. Nevertheless, it was unclear if the experimental set up was suitable for our case, since CD4+ T cells need to get activated before they can be electroporated. This suggests the use of gene editing to reach a more robust knockdown, which allows Discussion 101 for resting the cells before analysis. Different targeting strategies are possible for the gene editing approach. Importantly, several publications [294, 295] have shown that Exon 1 of RCAN3 can be non-coding, making it unattractive for gene editing purposes. We rather suggest to target the region harboring the CIC motif within Exon 5, which was found to be the interacting domain for calcineurin [112]. Preliminary results suggest that editing efficiency of 50-60% can be achieved in this locus. Further experiments will show if these mutations have any biological effect, e.g. increase IL-2 production. Another approach is the mutation of the miR-17 seed sequence of RCAN3 to investigate the functional importance of this miRNA:mRNA interaction [278, 296]. For this, we suggest to use rescue cells and target their miR-17 seed sequence in the RCAN3 3'UTR. This should reduce the RCAN3 targeting, and abolish the rescue affect. However, also this experiment will need careful optimization: with the use of classical Cas9 derived from S.pyogenes, we are dependent on the abundance of the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence NGG directly downstream of the target locus [297, 298], which will induce a double strand break in the DNA 4bp upstream of the PAM. The challenge at this point is that the seed sequence is only 8nt in length, and the PAMs around this seed allow only double strand breaks right after and before the seed. Since disruption of the seed or deletion is needed, this suggests the use of a multiplexing approach, introducing two double strand breaks at both sides of the seed, with the chance of recombination without the seed. However, this might result in a mild phenotype: due to redundancy of miRNA function, the phenotypic consequences of a single miRNA:target disruption can be very minor [299]. Over all, these experiments to knock out RCAN3 are possible but will need careful optimization and control of the experimental setup. So far, we suggest that RCAN3 is most likely targeted by miR-17, leading to differences in mRNA and protein expression depending on CD28 and/or miR-17~92 expression. Discussion 102 7.3.4. Exogenous miR-17~92 expression decreases sensitivity to Cyclosporin A The activity of calcineurin leads to NFAT de-phosphorylation, translocation to the nucleus [51] and initiation of transcriptional activation. Therefore, the consequences of increased (or decreased) RCAN3 expression are crucial for CD4+ T cell activation and differentiation. Current immunosuppressive drugs like CsA and FK506 target CD4+ T cell activation by inhibition of the enzymatic activity of calcineurin [300]. This leads to a very efficient inhibition of the NFAT pathway and T cell activation, however it comes at the cost of severe side effects [301]. We hypothesized that manipulation of a natural calcineurin inhibitor like RCAN3 with miR-17~92 modifies the sensitivity to CsA. Indeed, we demonstrate that CD28ko cells react more sensitively to CsA than wt and rescue cells, which was also manifested in decreased nuclear localization of NFAT. CD28 so far had only been shown to be essential for nuclear localization of NFB [162], and it had been demonstrated before that NFAT dependent transcription of IL-2 was abolished by CsA [302, 303]. Surprisingly, nuclear localization of NFAT in CD28ko was only partially reduced in low concentrations of CsA. However, this seemed to be sufficient to reduce activation. Usually, cytokines bind to their corresponding receptors which signal via STAT proteins to initiate transcription of TFs and cytokines, which then act in a feedback loop [125, 284, 285, 304]. We suggest that this loop is interrupted in CD28ko cells through increased RCAN3 expression, resulting in decreased NFAT nuclear localization and reduced cytokine production. With exogenous miR-17~92 expression, leading to targeting and repression of RCAN3, NFAT activity is increased, cytokine expression is promoted and the loop is at least partially restored. These experiments indicate that miR-17~92 and CD28 expression are contributing factors to CsA responsiveness. We propose that this effect is mediated by RCAN3 repression, which consequently promotes calcineurin activity. This discovery bears great potential for development of new therapeutic approaches in immunosuppression as will be discussed in the next section. Discussion 103 7.4. Relevance and future perspective The relevance of CD28 for immune therapy is diverse. On one hand, it has been shown to be essential for the efficacy of PD-1 checkpoint blockade [147, 148] and immune suppression [305] but also lately in the development of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, intracellular CD28 signaling domains have been shown to be crucial for function [306]. The role of miR-17~92 in the context of CD28 that we demonstrated in this thesis therefore bears great potential for the development of new therapies. However, the translation of our findings in mice to human is delicate and will need detailed investigation. The exact translation of miRNA findings from mouse to human is usually difficult. Expression of targets, miRNAs and conservation has to be verified [192, 307]. miR-17~92 is highly conserved between mice and humans, has been shown to be expressed in human CD4+ T cells, and it was demonstrated to be important for the human CD4+ T cell function (see section 3.2.3.4). For example, in Jurkat cells, an immortalized cell line of human T lymphocytes, transgenic expression of miR-17~92 led to increased IL-2 production [308]. We therefore expect that the role for miR-17~92 in CD28 dependent co-stimulation of human CD4+ T cells is similarly important as in murine CD4+ T cells, although this still has to be investigated. The expression of target gene RCAN3 is a separate question. Interestingly, more than 20 (theoretical) splice variants of this protein were reported so far, however some of them in tissue and context dependent manner [309]. It will therefore be crucial to determine which RCAN3 variant is present, if the variant is changed upon activation, and if miR-17 also suppresses RCAN3 in human CD4+ T cells. Moreover, assuming that this will be the case, the sensitivity to calcineurin inhibitors need to be investigated. The calcineurin inhibitors FK506 (Tacrolimus) and CsA have been used for treatment in the field of organ transplantation for more than 30 years [54]. Both of them share their pharmacodynamic property of inhibition of calcineurin [310]. However, even if great success in terms of prevention of organ rejection are reached with these calcineurin inhibitors, it comes at the cost of nephrotoxicity [311] as well as neurotoxicity [312]. The two inhibitors differ in their detailed toxicity profile, however both of them induce severe side effects. Even if many attempts for therapy improvement have been taken in the last years, the complete avoidance of calcineurin Discussion 104 inhibitors comes with significantly higher risk of rejection and/or graft loss [54]. With our results showing that miR-17~92 promoting calcineurin-NFAT, we identify a new potential target for calcineurin inhibition. The idea of promoting RCAN3 activity instead of inhibiting calcineurin was already proposed when the molecule was described to inhibit calcineurin activity [112]. We suggest to target the miRNA which targets RCAN3 for immune modulation: through interfering with miR-17 expression, the natural inhibition of calcineurin by RCAN3 might be enhanced. Several mechanisms of how targeting of miRNAs could be achieved in patients have been suggested [313, 314], e.g. miRNA sponges, antisense oligonucleotides and small molecule inhibitors. The first miRNA drug, which is miravirsen targeting miR-122 in Hepatitis C treatment, is currently in clinical trials [315, 316]. Thus, targeting of miRNAs in patients seems possible, though careful investigation and monitoring of potential new side effects will be crucial. Another possibility for application would be the exploitation of increased resistance to calcineurin inhibitors due to exogenous miR-17~92 expression. This is especially interesting in the case of transplantation of engineered cells, e.g. CAR T cells, to immunosuppressed patients. Transgenic expression of miR-17~92 in CAR T cells was already shown to augment proliferation, IFN and targeting efficacy [317]. In addition to the beneficial effect of miR-17~92 expression leading to \"more activation\", we expect to achieve resistance to ongoing immunosuppressive medication, paving the way for CAR T cell therapy in organ transplant recipients. Next to the potential of RCAN3 and NFAT as new targets of miR-17~92, our data also provide the potential for further research. It will be interesting to look into our bona fide canonical target gene list and elucidate their role in T cell activation. For this, the use of focused candidate gene deletion with CRISPR/Cas9 is the most promising. Furthermore, as already mentioned, we restrict our analysis to canonical targets, while non-canonical targets might be important for CD4+ T cell activation as well. After all, we provide strong evidence that miR-17~92 not only promotes PI3K pathway via PTEN repression [218, 232] but also promotes NFAT pathway via RCAN3 targeting. It is important to keep in mind that rather the combination of pathways than a single target finally result in the rescue of CD28ko cells. We therefore suggest to also Discussion 105 investigate combinations of gene deletions to address their cooperative role and synergistic effects during CD4+ T cell activation in the future. Conclusion and model 106 8. Conclusion and model In the present thesis project, we showed that 1. miR-17~92 is an important modulator of CD28 co-stimulation 2. exogenous miR-17~92 expression can rescue CD28 deficiency in vitro and in vivo 3. bona fide canonical target genes are regulated by miR-17~92 and CD28, and the rescue effect is mediated at transcriptome level 4. not only induction of expression, but also repression of genes is important during CD28 co-stimulation 5. miR-17~92 promotes calcineurin/NFAT most likely inhibitor RCAN3, with modulates sensitivity to calcineurin inhibitors Our results are surprising regarding the fact that other than conventional TFs, miRNAs are often seen as fine tuners of expression rather than master regulators of gene expression [299]. Importantly, we show that miR-17~92 is an essential contributor to CD28 co-stimulation, which possibly results from the sum of different targets and pathways regulated by miR-17~92, of which so far only the PI3K pathway has been known. We show that also the NFAT pathway is regulated by miR-17~92, most likely by targeting RCAN3. This leads to increased expression of NFAT-induced genes, e.g. cytokines as illustrated in Figure 39. Disclosure 107 Figure 39. Suggested model for miR-17~92 influence on NFAT pathway CD4+ T cell activation with CD28 co-stimulation initiates many different processes, among which is the activation of PI3K, recruitment of PLC and cleavage of PIP2 to DAG and IP3. IP3 binds to Ca2+ channels in the ER membrane, releasing Ca2+ from the ER stores. This is sensed by STIM1/2, which therefore interact with ORAI1/2. These change their conformation, allowing Ca2+ influx and activation of calcineurin. Calcineurin de-phosphorylates NFAT, which translocates to the nucleus where it dimerizes with other factors to initiate transcription. Calcineurin is inhibited by immunosuppressive drugs like CsA and FK506. miR-17~92 is also induced with CD28 co-stimulation and regulates different targets, e.g. PTEN and PHLPP2 which in turn are inhibitors of the PI3K pathway. We newly suggest RCAN3 as a target for miR-17~92, which is a natural inhibitor of calcineurin. Thereby, miR-17~92 indirectly promotes NFAT activity and T cell activation. 9.
