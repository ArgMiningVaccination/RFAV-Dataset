Natural Awareness is the expansive, objectless, effortless form of mindfulness, sometimes referred to as \"awareness of awareness.\" Her influences on the development of Natural Awareness teachings include Tibetan Buddhist Dzogchen and Mahamudra, Hindu Advaita Vedanta, Thai Forest Tradition and contemporary Insight Meditation (both Theravadin Buddhist), and Zen Buddhism. Diana leads many classes, retreats, and programs to study and practice Natural Awareness. Please check out [her events page](/upcoming). She also has a Study Group for advanced students who wish to go deeper into this practice, but it is currently closed. Feel free [to inquire via email for future dates](/contact).
