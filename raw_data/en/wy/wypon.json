Those trained here have gone on to use their learning to create new ventures, add skills to existing careers, and better navigate their lives. WholeSpirit is based on core principles of spiritual healing and personal evolution. We offer sessions for intuitive consultations, shamanic healing and counseling, and energetic healing. To support your spiritual practice, we also offer instruction in nature based healing, shamanic journeying, creating healthy energetic boundaries (Energy Ecosystem), and books and training to learn about shamanism, developing intuition, and other forms of emotional and spiritual wellness.

We are careful not to appropriate traditions, ceremonies, or rituals, or to claim the title of shaman.
