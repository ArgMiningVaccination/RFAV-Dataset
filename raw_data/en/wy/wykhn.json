Graff Zivin, Matthew J. Neidell, Nicholas J. Sanders, and Gregor Singer NBER Working Paper No. 27982 October 2020, Revised July 2022 JEL No. H23,I12,Q53 ABSTRACT Influenza and air pollution each pose significant health risks with global economic consequences. Their shared etiological pathways present a case of compounding health risk via interacting externalities. Using instrumental variables based on changing wind direction, we show increased levels of contemporaneous pollution increase influenza hospitalizations. We exploit random variation in effectiveness of the influenza vaccine as an additional instrument to show vaccine protection neutralizes this relationship. Thus, pollution control and vaccination campaigns jointly provide greater returns than those implied by addressing either in isolation. We show the importance of this consideration in addressing observed gaps in influenza incidence by race. Joshua S.

The flu causes an estimated 3-5 million severe cases per year, and nearly half a million deaths (Lambert and Fauci, 2010; Iuliano et al., 2018). Air pollution causes 4.5 million annual deaths (Cohen et al., 2017), with annual economic costs estimated to exceed $US 800 billion in the U.S. alone (Putri et al., 2018; Tschofen, Azevedo and Muller, 2019). While public health policies to address these issues are often considered in isolation, both share common etiological pathways through which they harm human health. Interactions between the flu and pollution are an illustrative economic case of compounding risk from interacting externalities. Influenza is an infectious disease whereby the actions of one infected individual impose negative externalities on others by increasing risk of infection, while air pollution is a negative externality of economic activity. Our analysis demonstrates that policies to address these distinct externalities have signicant interactive e\u0000ects: the flu vaccine can protect against certain harms from air pollution, and reduced levels of air pollution lessen the harmful e\u0000ects of influenza exposure. Thus, the seemingly disparate policy actions of pollution control and expanded vaccination may jointly provide greater returns than when studied in isolation. We begin our analysis by exploring the relationship between air pollution and influenza. Expo- sure to air pollution can a\u0000ect influenza severity (Jaspers et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2014) and, to a lesser degree, its spread (Chen et al., 2010). We extend the cross-sectional epidemiological literature1to es- tablish a causal relationship between air pollution and flu cases. We use patient-level administrative data on inpatient hospitalizations from 2007-2017 across 21 U.S. states, which allows us to focus on cases with a denitive influenza diagnosis.2We address the identication challenge that vaccine take- up and pollution exposure are often endogenously determined by using a dual instrumental variables approach. We rst estimate econometric models with spatial and temporal xed e\u0000ects to control for numerous unobservable factors, and then build on the pioneering work of (Deryugina et al., 2019)b y using plausibly exogenous variation in wind directions as an instrument for pollution. We nd higher pollution levels signicantly increase flu inpatient hospitalizations; a one-standard-deviation increase in the monthly Air Quality Index (10.9-unit increase in our data) amounts to approximately 35.7% additional flu-related inpatient hospitalizations in the U.S. during influenza season. Compared to the e\u0000ect of air pollution on all respiratory hospitalizations, our ndings suggest influenza accounts for around 18% of all air pollution-induced respiratory inpatient hospitalizations. Next, we explore whether influenza vaccine protection, which we dene as a combination of vac- 1See, for example, Brauer et al. (2002), Wong et al. (2009), Chen et al. (2010), Liang et al. (2014) and the important economic history paper by Clay, Lewis and Severnini (2018). In a study of the Spanish flu in 1918, Clay, Lewis and Severnini (2018) show cities with higher coal-red power generating capacity saw higher mortality rates, potentially through exposure to higher air pollution. 2Estimation based simply on physician encounters is more di\u0000cult, as influenza testing is not conducted systematically, and reporting of positive cases is not mandatory for this patient population. 2cine take-up and e\u0000ectiveness, moderates the estimated relationship above. As vaccine take-up can be endogenous across both time and location, we instrument for vaccine protection using vaccine ef- fectiveness weighted by influenza-susceptibility (in addition to using our instrument for pollution). E\u0000ectiveness of the flu vaccine varies from year to year: producers forecast viral strain match months ahead of time, and antigenic drift or shift induces random deviations in realized match quality.3This makes the random draw of the viral match orthogonal to unobserved determinants of health, allowing us to identify a causal relationship between the vaccine and health harms from pollution. The orthog- onality of vaccine e\u0000ectiveness also o\u0000ers an additional test that pollution has a causal e\u0000ect on fluadmissions. If a vaccine designed specically to protect against the flu diminishes the impact of pollu- tion on influenza hospital admissions, then it must be the case that pollution contributes to influenza hospitalizations. When we include an interaction between air pollution and vaccine protection, we ndthat the flu vaccine o\u0000ers signicant protection from influenza-related costs of pollution. 4Vaccine pro- tection levels close to the average across time in our sample fully neutralize the relationship between pollution and additional flu hospitalizations. Given the unequal burden of both flu and pollution exposure across society, we also explore results by race and ethnicity. Both of our main ndings - that air pollution increases flu hospitalizations and vaccine protection moderates this relationship - are consistent across these dimensions. Combined with evidence of signicant di\u0000erences in flu incidence and severity by race (e.g. Quinn et al., 2011), our re- sults suggest that the well-established di\u0000erences in ambient pollution concentrations across racial and ethnic groups (e.g. Banzhaf, Ma and Timmins, 2019; Colmer et al., 2020; Currie, Voorheis and Walker, 2020) serve as an important mechanism driving disparities in influenza outcomes across such groups. Moreover, since flu vaccines protect against some pollution-induced harms, our results imply that the private and external benets from vaccines is considerably higher in communities disproportionately exposed to poor air quality. Our source of exogenous variation in vulnerability to pollution through vaccine e\u0000ectiveness also contributes to the literature on the distribution of environmental damagesthat depends not only on exposure but also vulnerability (Hsiang et al., 2019; Deryugina et al., 2021). An important feature of our context is that the spread of influenza and pollution are externalities. As externalities, they justify government intervention in the form of policies, such as increased vaccinetake-up and improved air quality. 5The interaction of the two suggests that the seemingly disparate pol- icy actions of pollution control and vaccination campaigns jointly provide greater returns than those implied by addressing either in isolation. A back of the envelope calculation suggests a 10% (3.5 AQI 3Other papers using similar variation include Ward (2014) and White (2021). 4Access to health care may ameliorate impacts of adverse environmental conditions more generally. Mullins and White (2020) show that better access to acute care can help protect against health harms from extreme temperature. 5A similar logic applies to the more di\u0000cult task of improving vaccine e\u0000ectiveness. In that case, policies are more likely to utilize the standard push and pull mechanisms used to overcome the underinvestment problem that arises due to the public good nature of scientic knowledge (Kremer and Williams, 2010). 3points) reduction in the AQI in a historically ine\u0000ective vaccine year (11% vaccine take-up adjusted for e\u0000ectiveness) would avert 16.6% of all influenza-associated hospitalizations across the U.S. Meanwhile a 10% improvement in vaccine take-up at the average vaccine e\u0000ectiveness (or, equivalently, a 10% im- provement in vaccine e\u0000ectiveness at the average vaccine take-up) in a historically polluted year (38.2 AQI) would avert 34.6% of pollution-driven influenza hospitalizations. The optimal mix of these poli- cies will depend on relative costs as well as the 'spillover' benets each may generate beyond influenza. The paper proceeds as follows. We begin by describing potential biological mechanisms and our data, and present why it is particularly well-suited to addressing the question of interacting externalities(Section I). We then discuss our econometric model, and describe in detail the various instruments we use to address issues of endogeneity and measurement error (Section II). After we present our main results and explore variations in our model assumptions, we discuss the implications of our ndings, both in the context of our analysis and the larger question of social welfare maximization (Section III), before we conclude (Section IV). I. Background and Data A. Potential biological mechanisms The primary channel through which air pollution could a\u0000ect influenza hospitalizations is increasing severity of influenza. Like smoking (Han et al., 2019), air pollution can impair the respiratory func- tioning of patients, e.g., by damaging the respiratory epithelium, thereby facilitating the progression of influenza virus beyond the epithelial barrier into the lungs (Diamond, Legarda and Ryan, 2000; Jaspers et al., 2005; Ciencewicki and Jaspers, 2007; Rivas-Santiago et al., 2015). Existing medical research nds exposing in vitro respiratory epithelial cells to air pollution increases susceptibility and penetration of influenza (Jaspers et al., 2005), and experimental exposure of mice to air pollution before influenza infections increases morbidity and mortality (Hahon et al., 1985; Lee et al., 2014). There is also some suggestive evidence that air pollution could a\u0000ect influenza hospitalizations through modest increases in the spread of influenza. Like humidity and temperature (Lowen et al., 2007; Shaman and al., 1985; Casanova et al., 2010), air pollution particles could extend the airborne survival of viruses outside the body (Ijaz et al., 1985; Tellier, 2009; Chen et Lou et al., 2017; Wolko\u0000, 2018) and thus increase the probability of disease transmission. B. Data We combine data from multiple sources on health outcomes, pollution concentrations, vaccine infor-mation and weather variables. 4Inpatient hospitalizations: Our primary health outcome is inpatient hospitalizations for influenza. We use patient-level data on inpatient hospitalizations from the Health Care and Utilization Project (HCUP, 2018b). The HCUP data covers the universe of hospital admissions in the reporting states. While Medicare data, an alternative popular data source, covers the entire U.S., the advantage of the HCUP data is that it covers all age groups, not only the elderly. We focus on influenza cases by us- ing patient level information on diagnosed diseases per International Classication of Diseases (ICD) codes.6We limit analysis to data from 2007 to 2017, for which we also have detailed vaccine e\u0000ective- ness data available. This gives us an unbalanced panel of 21 U.S. states, with an average of 5.5 years of observations per state (see Table A.1 in Appendix A.1 for details on data availability by state and year). Figure A.1 in the Appendix shows that the HCUP data is broadly representative of U.S. data by comparing distributions of several socio-demographic variables across counties in our HCUP data with distributions across all U.S. counties. We dene our outcome as the count of inpatient admissions per county-year-month where the ICD code indicates influenza.7Given the presence of primary and secondary diagnosis codes, we conduct analyses using three possible classications of flu admissions: (i) cases where the only diagnosis isinfluenza (most restrictive); (ii) cases where any diagnosis is influenza (least restrictive); and (iii) cases where the primary diagnosis is influenza. The third option reflects a middle ground which weuse as our baseline outcome. We focus on the influenza season, which the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) denes as October to March, and explore results extending the season in Appendix A.3. Figure 1ashows the seasonality of inpatient hospitalizations in our data, which matches closely with general CDC-reported influenza-like illnesses (see Table A.2 in Appendix A.1). Based on month of admission and patient zip code, we aggregate hospitalization data to the county-year-month level and assign a zero value to counties in months with no reported influenza admission, conditional on reporting data in the given year. 8During the influenza season, 54% of county-year-months have no reported influenza- related hospital admissions in the HCUP data, and our results are robust to inclusion or exclusion ofzero valued county-year-months. To compare our main results with the more general e\u0000ect of air pollu- tion on any respiratory hospitalization (including influenza), we also construct a variable that contains the count of inpatient hospitalizations where the primary diagnosis is any respiratory diagnosis. 9Fi- 6We exclude patients whose zip code is from a di\u0000erent state than the hospital in which they are treated. 7We use the Clinical Classications Software (CCS) from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to classify relevant influenza ICD codes. These are all 5-digit ICD codes grouped under the following 3-digit ICD-9-CM codes: 487, 488; and, for the period from October 2015 when the system was changed to ICD-10-CM, the following 3-digit ICD-10-CMcodes: J09, J10, J11. 8Put we only impute zeros for counties and year-months in states that report data in that given year but have zero influenza hospitalizations in a given month. We use the crosswalk from zip codes to counties from the U.S. Departmentof Housing and Urban Development (Din and Wilson, 2020). 9These are all 5-digit ICD codes grouped under the following 2-digit ICD-9-CM codes: 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51; and the 5nally, for a falsication test we use primary ICD codes associated with osteoarthritis as an outcome variable, which is unlikely to be a\u0000ected by air quality and influenza.10 Air quality: As our measure of pollution, we begin with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA, 2020) Air Quality Index (AQI) at the county-day level, which we aggregate to county-by-year-by- month to match hospitalization outcomes.11We focus on the AQI as a summary measure of overall air quality, based on the primary criteria pollutants specied in the Clean Air Act.12We do so as the high degree of correlation between several individual pollutants makes it challenging to separately identify the e\u0000ect of each pollutant independently. We note that most of the \"forcing\" pollutant that drives variation in the AQI in our setting is PM2.5. Weather, wind directions and inversions: To address weather as a confounder, we use monthly weather averages from Xia et al. (2012); Mocko and NASA/GSFC/HSL (2012), including temperature, specic humidity, vertical and horizontal wind speed, and precipitation at the 0.125 by 0.125 degree level, all aggregated up to the county-by-year-by-month level. To construct our main instrument for pollution, we construct wind direction for a county-year- month by taking the average horizontal (u i) and vertical (v i) wind components from the monthly raw data and calculating the average angle the wind is blowing from as WDIR i= 180/ arctan 2( \u0000ui,\u0000vi).13 Temperature inversions ground-level pollution levels (Arceo, Hanna and Oliva, 2016), which allows us to use inversions as an additional pollution instrument. To calculate inversions,we use daily three-dimensional temperature averages between midnight and 6AM at each location on each day from GMAO (2015), regridded to the 0.25 by 0.25 degree level. We use the di\u0000erence in temperature between the two pressure levels closest to the surface at each location, and average this di\u0000erence up to the county-day level. We then calculate the share of days with inversions in a county- year-month as the share of days when the di\u0000erence between the layer further away from the surface and the layer closest to the surface is positive, i.e., the temperature rises with altitude. We calculate the average strength of inversion in a county-year-month as the average di\u0000erence in temperature between the two altitude levels on the days where inversions are e\u0000ects for all disease groupings as additional robustness checks in the Appendix. 11The EPA pre-aggregates data to the daily county level in the case of multiple monitors per county. For missing county- year-months, we take the average value of the adjacent counties in the same month. We winsorize the AQI at the top and bottom 1% for the main analysis, and show robust results to both data cleaning choices in Appendix A.3. 12The AQI captures pollution from particulate matter (PM2.5 or PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and ozone (O 3). See Appendix A.1 for descriptive statistics. The EPA provides further details on AQI calculation in EPA (2018). 13We calculate wind speed for our control variables as WSPEED i=p u2 i+v2 i. 60 2 4 6 8Average count of influenza hospitalizations per county Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Average hospitalizations per county (a) Seasonality of hospitalizations 0 .1 .2 .3 .4 .5 .6 Age 8 Age 9-17 Age 19-49 Age 50-64 Age 65 Share in hospitalizations Vaccine take-up rate (b) Hospitalizations and vaccination by age0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7Vaccine effectiveness (VE) 65 Age 50-65 Age 18-49 Age 9-17 Age 8 (c) Age-specic vaccine e\u0000ectiveness (VE season Average vaccine protection (VP) States with maximum and minimum VP (d) Vaccine protection (VP ) Figure 1: Descriptive gures on influenza inpatient hospitalizations and vaccine take-up and e\u0000ective- ness Notes: Panel (a) shows the average count of influenza inpatient hospitalizations per county-month in the HCUP (2018 b) data. Panel (b) shows the age group shares of influenza inpatient admissions, as well as age group-specic vaccine take-up, both pooled across states and time. Panel (c) plots (raw) reported vaccine e\u0000ectiveness for each age group over influenza seasons (with the exception of 08/09 where no data are available). The thick black line plots our weighted measure of overall vaccine e\u0000ectiveness. Panel (c) plots vaccine protection averaged across states as the thick line. The bands illustrate the variation within each season across states by plotting the states with the maximum and minimum vaccine protection in each season. Vaccine take-up and e\u0000ectiveness: We obtain average vaccine take-up rates (VR ) by state, season, and age group or racial group from CDC (2008, 2009, 2015, 2020); Lu et al. (2013); Schiller and Euler (2009). Figure 1b shows that on average, vaccine take-up is highest among those 65 years and older or those 8 years and younger. Figure A.4a in Appendix A.1 shows temporal variation in vaccine take-up rates by age group and Figure A.4b by race. Figure A.4c shows spatial variation by taking a cross-section of vaccine take-up rates among those 65 years and older across di\u0000erent states in a given influenza season, in this case 2009/2010. The gures illustrate that the variation in vaccine take-up is larger across age groups than across racial groups, across time or across space. We obtain measures of vaccine e\u0000ectiveness by influenza season and age group, VEraw, from the studies underlying CDC estimates (CDC, 2019), available beginning in the 2007/2008 season (Belongia 7et al., 2014; McLean et al., 2015; Gaglani et al., 2016; Zimmerman et al., 2016; Jackson et al., 2017; Flannery et al., 2019; Rolfes et al., 2019; Flannery et al., 2020) with the exception of the 2008/2009 season.14These studies measure vaccine e\u0000ectiveness as the vaccination-induced percentage reduction in the odds of testing positive for influenza conditional on having influenza-like symptoms. One can interpret vaccine e\u0000ectiveness as the approximate share of vaccinated people who do not test positive but would have absent the vaccine.15 Figure 1c plots age-specic vaccine e\u0000ectiveness against influenza season, showing variation both across seasons and age groups. Across seasons, the match between circulating viral strains and the vaccines based on forecasts is imperfect and varies due to antigenic drift. Within a season, the match can be of di\u0000erent quality for di\u0000erent age groups due to \"original antigenic sin\" (Francis, 1960); the rst influenza strain to which the immune system is exposed imprints immunological memory with that specic strain, such that di\u0000erent generations with di\u0000erent antigenic imprints respond di\u0000erently to new vaccines and strains within years. Constructing vaccine protection: The share of people protected by the vaccine in each season and state is a combination of take-up rate VRand age group-weighted vaccine e\u0000ectiveness VE. As an example, for a group with homogeneous e\u0000ects from exposure, if 50% of people are vaccinated, but the vaccine is only 30% e\u0000ective, the e\u0000ective vaccine protection (VP ) is the same as when only 30% of people are vaccinated but the vaccine is 50% e\u0000ective. For groups with heterogeneous vulnerability, aggregate hospitalizations also depend on whether those individuals that are more vulnerable than others have a higher take-up rate or vaccine e\u0000ectiveness. An 80-year old without a vaccine, for example, is much more likely to be hospitalized with influenza than a 30-year old without a vaccine. Figure 1b shows hospitalization incidence is highest for two age groups: 65-years and older and 8-years and younger.16 To construct a population-level measure of vaccine protection that accounts for such di\u0000erences in vul-nerability, we weight age-specic vaccine take-up rates and vaccine e\u0000ectiveness by influenza hospital- (VR csavaries at the state level, but we index by counties for simpler nota- tion in the following sections), sdenotes influenza seasons, and adenotes age groups. Hospitalization weights HSaare a simple average across influenza seasons s, i.e.,HSa=1 SP sHSsa, and the rst term 14The CDC measures vaccine e\u0000ectiveness across influenza seasons rather than calendar years, as seasons overlap calendar years (e.g., October-December for year yand January-March for year y+1. 15The odds ratio is approximately the relative risk due to a small number of influenza positive cases (Zhang and Kai, 1998). 16We construct groups with these age cuto\u0000s because they coincide with the common age cuto\u0000s in vaccine e\u0000ectiveness studies. 81P a(HSa)ensures that the age weights sum to one, such that overall hospitalizations do not a\u0000ect our values of VPcs. We plot VPcsaveraged across states in Figure 1d, along with the VPcsof the state with the highest and lowest VPcsin each influenza season. The minimum of VPcsis 0.08 and the maximum is 0.33. Since VPis constant within the season, vaccination rates VRcsathat di\u0000er across states solely drive cross-sectional spatial variation in VPcs. The sources of temporal variation in VPcsare both vaccination rates VRcsaand vaccine e\u0000ectiveness VEraw sawhich vary across influenza seasons. Equation (1) shows that a 10% increase in VPcscan either be the result of a 10% increase in vaccine rates in all age groups or a 10% increase in vaccine e\u0000ectiveness in all age groups (or some combination of both e\u0000ects). For our analysis of heterogeneity across di\u0000erent age groups, we only use vaccination rates and vaccine e\u0000ectiveness for the relevant age groups in constructing VPcs. For heterogeneity analysis across di\u0000er- ent racial groups, we use our overall measure of vaccine protection scaled by the ratio of race specic take-up in a season to overall vaccine take-up in a season. Mortality and emergency department (ED) visits: Although our primary focus is on inpatient hospi- talizations, we also extend our analysis to consider influenza-related emergency department visits and mortality. Data on visits to emergency departments is from HCUP (2018 a), and has overlapping spatial coverage with our main inpatient data. Individual level mortality data from NCHS (2019) covers every county in the U.S. and includes deaths that happen inside or outside of hospitals. For both ED visits and mortality, we count every hospitalization or death with influenza as primary cause as above, and aggregate to the county-by-year-by-month level. Socio-demographics: We use employment counts at the county-by-year-by-month level from the Bu- reau of Labor Statistics (2021) as an additional control in robustness checks. Our analysis of policy implications utilizes county population data by race from the 2010 U.S. Census (U.S. Census Bureau, 2020) and county median income data from Chetty et al. (2018). II. Empirical Strategy Given the nature of our outcome variables, we estimate count models as our primary specication, though we also estimate linear models as a specication check. We estimate the relationship between the count of influenza-related inpatient hospitalizations Hcymand the lagged air quality index AQI cym\u00001 at the county cby year yby calendar month mlevel using the following conditional exponential mean function (consistent with a Poisson count data lag the AQI one month to capture exposure to air pollution before hospital admission, and control for a wide variety of both regional and temporal factors. Our preferred specication includes each influenza season sspans October through March and overlaps calendar years yandy+1, the county-by-season-by-year xed e\u0000ects xed e\u0000ects capture the bulk of climatic di\u0000erences across counties, we also include contem-poraneous weather controls X cymand lagged weather controls Xcym\u00001to address the link between both influenza and weather (temperature and humidity can influence influenza transmission rates) andweather and pollution (di\u0000erent climatic conditions can lead to di\u0000erent levels of air quality) within county-quarter-years. 18Note that our outcome variable is the count of influenza hospitalizations, but inclusion of our xed e\u0000ects in Equation (2) ensures our estimates are equivalent to recovering the e\u0000ect on hospitalization rates per capita.19 County-by-season-by-year (or county-by-quarter-by-year) e\u0000ects \u0000csycontrol for di\u0000erences in un- observed confounders that influence pollution exposure and health outcomes across counties sepa-rately for every quarter-by-year, such as demographics, socio-economic factors, or health care access and protocols. This also addresses a possible concern due to potential variation in random diagnosticinfluenza testing in hospitals that could mask true influenza rates. Our xed e\u0000ects absorb potential bias from discrepancy between actual and observed hospitalizations as long as the ratio between them is constant within county-quarter-years and/or year-months. 20Year-by-month xed e\u0000ects control for seasonality and general monthly trends within each year in both influenza and pollution. For exam- ple, two common lung irritants included in the AQI, particulate matter and carbon monoxide, peak in winter months much like influenza admissions; year-by-month xed e\u0000ects capture such seasonality. In robustness checks, we examine models using alternative xed e\u0000ects specications. Given the included xed e\u0000ects, two remaining threats to identication are unobserved confound- ing within each county-by-quarter-by-year cell and measurement error in pollution assignment. For ex- 17The county-by-season-by-year xed e\u0000ects (\u0000 csy) are and county-by-season xed e\u0000ects separately. 18This includes information on temperature, specic humidity, precipitation, and wind speed. Temperature and humidity have been shown to a\u0000ect both virus survival (Lowen et al., 2010; al., 2010; Harper, 1961) and air pollution (Ijaz et al., 1985; Lou et al., 2017; Greenburg et al., 1967). In our baseline model we include ve quintile bins for temperature (C), ve quintile bins of specic humidity, and linear terms for precipitation and wind speed, all of which include contemporaneous and lagged versions. 19Influenza hospitalizations rates Hrates cym and cym =Hcym/Pop csy, where Pop csyis county population in each county-season-year cell. We can multiply both sides of Equation (2)b y exp(log(1 /Pop csy))such that our estimation recovers the e\u0000ect on Hrates cym as dependent variable, ab- /Pop csy)). 20Suppose actual (unobserved) Hactual cym and measured diagnosed influenza hospitalizations Hcymrelate in the following way: Hactual cym =HcymRcsyRym, where RcsyRymcaptures arbitrary discrepancy be- tween actual and observed hospitalizations. If we insert this relationship in Equation (2), we can multiply both sides byexp(log( R csy)+l o g( Rym))such that our estimation recovers the e\u0000ect on the unobserved Hactual cym as dependent variable, and the xed e\u0000ects absorb exp(log( Rcsy)+l o g ( Rym)). 10ample, increased economic activity and interaction between people at the local level could drive both air pollution and influenza infections. We control for lagged employment at the county-by-year-by-month level in our regressions as one approach, but this may not fully capture this relationship. Measurement error may arise because of the sparse nature of pollution monitors. To address these issues, our main strategy is to employ instrumental variables for air quality. A. Instrumenting for air quality We take an approach conceptually akin to that of Deryugina et al. (2019) by exploiting changes in wind direction as an instrument for the AQI. The idea behind the instrument is that wind blowing from a particular direction moves around the pollution internal to the county but also brings in external pol- lution. Appendix Figure A.5 provides an illustration using Su\u0000olk County, which contains the city of Boston, as an example. The polar plot indicates that monthly AQI is much higher when prevailing winds are blowing from the South-West, which is the direction of major polluting sources along the Eastern seaboard. The AQI is, however, much lower when prevailing winds are blowing from the East,which brings in cleaner air from the ocean. We are not using these values directly as our instrument for air pollution, as individuals may sort based on prevailing wind patterns. Instead, we use monthly changes in wind directions as our source of variation that shifts pollution, net of average pollution in the county. For example, if prevailing winds change from South-West to East in Boston, our instru- ment would shift pollution down for that particular month, net of average pollution levels in Boston in that year-quarter, conditional on our xed e\u0000ects and controls. The identifying assumption is that,conditional on our weather controls and xed e\u0000ects, wind direction a\u0000ects influenza hospitalizations only through its e\u0000ect on the AQI, but does not have a direct e\u0000ect on hospitalizations. Those exoge- nously determined changes in wind direction (conditional on wind speed, other weather controls andthe various xed e\u0000ects) result in changes in pollution levels in a neighborhood that are likely to be uncorrelated with local determinants of pollution. While we borrow the premise of this design from Deryugina et al. (2019), we modify the precise construction of the instruments. Specically, Deryugina et al. (2019) construct instruments (Z D i)b y using dummy variables for wind direction bins WDIRq i(e.g., WDIRNW ifor when wind is blowing from the North-West for observation ibelonging to a particular county in a particular point in time) interacted with geographical region level indicators Gc:ZD i=P cP qWDIRq iGc. One challenge in constructing this set of instruments is the choice of geographical granularity for Gc. On the one hand, ifGcare large regions including multiple counties, a particular wind direction requires that pollution shifts in the same direction and to the same degree for all counties in the same group Gc. Counties just North or just South of an urban center, however, are likely to receive the pollution shock when windblows from the opposite direction, rather than from the same direction. Similarly, a county South of a 11large urban center, and a county South of a small urban center, should receive a pollution shock when wind is blowing from the North, but the size of the pollution shock likely di\u0000ers. On the other hand, ifGcare small entities, e.g., counties themselves, each county is allowed to have di\u0000erent pollution shocks in di\u0000erent sizes from di\u0000erent wind directions, but the set of instruments grows larger than the number of panels or counties Nc. This can lead to computational di\u0000culties and ine\u0000cient standard errors.21Deryugina et al. (2019) balance this trade-o\u0000 by selecting the granularity of Gcbased on a k- means cluster algorithm, which generates groups that include nine counties on average. We instead solve this trade-o\u0000 by using a di\u0000erent approach that allows full flexibility in how wind directions shift pollution in di\u0000erent counties (i.e., Gcat the county level), while dramatically reducing the number of instruments as well. Instead of interacting wind direction bins with county indicators, we transform the values in the wind direction dummies to capture both the sign and size of pollution shocks from changes in wind direction for each county. We do this in two steps. First, we create a newvariable AQI qcwhich is pollution in county caveraged over the entire sample when wind is blowing from direction qin county c, demeaned by the average pollution level in county c: AQIqc=1P i2qcX i2qcAQIqc i\u00001P i2cX i2cAQI i (3) use AQIqcto generate a set of instruments Zq i, where each instrument corresponds to a particular wind direction (e.g., ZNW i), and the values of Zq iare populated by AQIqcif a particular observation ibelongs to county cand the wind in this particular year-month in this county blowing from Zq ialso addresses the two restrictions that arise when pooling multiple counties into groups. First, a single coe\u0000cient on a particular wind direction bin (e.g., the coe\u0000cient for ZNW i) accounts for di\u0000erent signs of pollution shocks for di\u0000erent counties from the same wind direction. For example, a county South-East of a major urban center is likely to have a positive value in ZNW i, whereas a county North-West of the major urban center is likely to have a negative value in ZNW i. Therefore the coe\u0000cient for ZNW ican shift pollution for the two counties into di\u0000erent directions. Second, a single coe\u0000cient on a particular wind direction bin 21Optimal (two-step) GMM with a clustered weighting matrix at the county level is infeasible, for example, because the number of instruments is larger than the number of clusters. 12also accounts for di\u0000erent sizes of pollution shocks. For example, a county South-East of a large urban center may experience larger pollution shocks when wind blows from the North-West than a county South-East of a small urban center. Since the average size of pollution shocks is captured in ZNW i, the same coe\u0000cient on ZNW ican shift pollution to a di\u0000erent extent in di\u0000erent counties. We design the instruments Zq ito capture pollution shocks that occur from changes in wind direc- tion. Since we use wind-induced pollution shocks averaged across the entire sample when constructingZ q i, we do not capture individual events that generate pollution shocks that only occur in a particular year-month in a particular county, which could be problematic since they may also correlate with in-fluenza cases. 22We also control for changes in weather that might a\u0000ect influenza hospitalizations directly and correlate with changes in wind direction, such as temperature, humidity, precipitation orwind speed. Finally, since we use a one-month lagged AQI as our variable of interest, we use a one- month lagged wind direction instrument to form our moment conditions. For our baseline model, we use the four quadrants as wind direction bins, but have also performed robustness checks with alternative numbers of wind direction bins. We estimate our instrumented model with a Poisson GMM-IV procedure that accounts for xed e\u0000ects through quasi-mean di\u0000er- encing, and construct moment conditions with our set of instruments. Note that the non-instrumented Poisson GMM estimates are numerically equivalent to a Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood (PPML) estimator. 23We cluster standard errors at the county level to allow for arbitrary heteroskedasticity and serial correlation. For our linear specication, we use the corresponding Linear GMM-IV procedure that is numerically equivalent to standard linear GMM optimization. We provide econometric details in Appendix A.2. As an expansion, we include further instruments for AQI based on thermal inversions (Arceo, Hanna and Oliva, 2016). Typically, air is colder the farther from the earth's surface. Thermal inver- sions appear when a warm air layer moves above a cold air layer, reducing air cycling and generatingstagnant air conditions. While inversions do not directly a\u0000ect health (conditional on temperature), they trap pollutants closer to the ground, leading to increases in pollution concentrations. 24We use the share of days with inversions and the average strength of inversions at the county-year-month level. We then interact both variables with a scaling variable that is the average county AQI across the entire sample. This allows inversions in more pollution-intensive regions (e.g., large urban centers) to shiftpollution more than in less pollution-intensive regions (e.g., rural counties). 22Identication does not use prevailing wind direction, which would not change across time and, as Deryugina et al. (2019) note, could lead to sorting or strategic placement of pollution monitors. Instead, our instrument uses month-to-month changes in wind patterns in a given county by year by quarter cell, which should not a\u0000ect sorting or monitor placement. 23We show the PPML (Correia, Guimar aes and Zylkin, 2019) estimates in the Appendix. The PPML point estimates are consistent as long as the conditional mean is correctly specied, irrespective of the distribution of the outcome or errors(Gourieroux et al., 1984). The PPML estimator performs well with a large number of zeros and over- or under-dispersion in the data (Silva and Tenreyro, 2006, 2011). 24We use inversions between midnight and 6AM to limit potential confounding through behavioral responses. 13While our Poisson GMM-IV xed e\u0000ects estimation does not have an explicit rst stage regression as in two-stage least squares estimations, we can approximate a rst stage by running a linear regression of AQI on our instruments and controls. Table A.3 in Appendix A.3 shows that our wind instruments shift pollution with a Kleibergen-Paap F-stat of 176.8 (Column 1).25Inversions also shift pollution, however, the Kleibergen-Paap F-stat is lower at 8.6 when including inversions alone (Column 4), and 91 when including wind direction and inversion instruments simultaneously (Column 7).26For this reason, our preferred specication relies solely on the instruments based on wind direction, though wealso show results with both sets of instruments. B. Vaccines To estimate the impact of vaccine protection ( VP cs) on the pollution-hospitalization relationship, we modify Equation 1 to include an interaction term AQI cym\u00001VPcs, noting that the base e\u0000ect VPcsis absorbed (5) Several econometric challenges exist in evaluating how the influenza vaccine alters the e\u0000ect of pollution on influenza. Recall vaccine protection VPcsis a composite measure of vaccine take-up and e\u0000ectiveness. Individuals may reduce avoidance behavior if vaccinated, or be more likely to get thevaccine in seasons with more reported influenza cases, both of which attenuate the raw e\u0000ect of the vaccine. Selection bias in vaccine take-up may also pose a problem if the most susceptible or most cautious are more likely to seek out vaccines. To address these issues, we instrument for potentially endogenous vaccine protection (VP cs) using exogenous vaccine e\u0000ectiveness (VE s). Our identifying variation exploits the natural variation in vaccine e\u0000ectiveness, determined by the random variationsin the quality of the match between the influenza vaccine and the viral strain in circulation. 27Note that at the time of vaccination, which is usually early in the influenza season, it is not yet known how e\u0000ective the vaccine will turn out over the course of the season. Therefore, vaccine take-up should generally not be a\u0000ected by vaccine e\u0000ectiveness. We conrm this empirically by regressing take-up on 25Note that all wind direction bins have a positive coe\u0000cient, because the values of the instrument are negative when a particular wind direction tends to blow in clean air for a particular county. The coe\u0000cients should converge to one as the sample size grows, either through the number of years of number of counties. Table A.4 shows this pattern in a Monte Carlosimulation of the approximated rst stage regression. 26Note that the sum of the two coe\u0000cients, the coe\u0000cient on the interaction between share of inversion days with the county average AQI ( AQI ) and the coe\u0000cient on share of inversion days, is positive at the average of AQI (34.7), and the same holds for the strength of inversions. 27See also Ward (2014) and White (2021) who, however, calculate vaccine e\u0000ectiveness based on the names of the viral strains in the vaccine and in circulation, which in contrast to our measure, do not take into account variations in vaccinee\u0000ectiveness across age groups and imperfectly map into clinical measures of e\u0000ectiveness. 14e\u0000ectiveness separately for our ve age groups and nd no statistically signicant association in any of the ve regressions, with estimated implied elasticities close to zero (see Appendix Table A.5). E\u0000ectiveness based on antigenic drift is, in principle, orthogonal to unobserved determinants of health in a given year. This provides insights into how vaccines a\u0000ect the pollution-induced spread of influenza and provides a test of the causal e\u0000ects of pollution on influenza. If vaccines moderate the e\u0000ect of pollution on influenza, it must be that pollution causally relates to influenza hospitaliza- tions, though we cannot distinguish between whether the vaccine is: (i) reducing the probability anypollution-harmed individual is exposed to the flu due to external benets from vaccination of others, or (ii) changing the probability that a pollution-harmed individual contracts a severe case of flu when exposed. To generate an overall measure of vaccine e\u0000ectiveness ( VE s) to instrument for VPcs, we construct a weighted average of time-varying age specic raw vaccine e\u0000ectiveness (VEraw sa, which Figure 1c shows). The weights for age groups are time-invariant and capture the age groups where vaccine ef- fectiveness matters relatively more: those with a greater tendency of hospitalization and those with higher vaccine take-up rates. Figure 1b shows these weights and that both hospitalization incidenceand vaccination rates are highest for those 65-years and older and 8-years and younger, the two most vulnerable groups in our sample. Our measure of vaccine e\u0000ectiveness is: VE s=1P a\u0000 rate weights VRaand hospitalization shares HSaare simple averages across influenza seasons s, e.g. VRa=1 SP sVRsa, and the rst term1P a(VRaHSa)ensures that the age weights sum to one such that overall vaccine take-up or hospitalizations do not a\u0000ect our values ofvaccine e\u0000ectiveness. As we use time-averaged hospitalization shares and vaccination rates, vaccine e\u0000ectiveness is the only source of temporal variation in our instrument. 28Figure 1c shows our nal measure of weighted vaccine e\u0000ectiveness ranges between 0.17 and 0.51 during our study period. By dening vaccine protection as a combination of vaccine e\u0000ectiveness and vaccine take-up, we interpret \u00002as a change in either component, suggesting policy can focus on either measure. This helps maintain a direct policy implication of our results \u2014 while random variation in vaccine e\u0000ectiveness provides a compelling identication strategy, policy e\u0000orts to improve it are met with limited success. Vaccine take-up rates, however, may be more amenable to policy intervention through e\u0000orts to reduce 28A potential threat to the exclusion criteria for our instrument occurs if shocks that increase the spread of influenza (e.g., a sporting event associated with a local team as in Stoecker, Sanders and Barreca (2016)), also increase influenza mutation rates and thus weaken vaccine e\u0000ectiveness. This concern is likely limited, as recent research suggests that random mutations during vaccine production, not from virus spread itself, drives mismatch of vaccines and strains in circulation. For discussionof this research, see Cohen (2017). 15Table 1: The e\u0000ect of air pollution on severe influenza cases Influenza is Influenza is Influenza is primary ICD code any ICD code only ICD code Panel A: Poisson GMM of VP - - 0.21 - 0.2 Mean of VE - 0.36 - 0.36 - 0.35 Notes: The dependent variable in Columns 1-2 is the count of inpatient hospital admissions with influenza as primary diagnosis within a county-year-month. The dependent variable in Columns 3-4 is the count of inpatient hospital admissions with influenza as any (primary or secondary) diagnosis within a county-year-month. The dependent variable in Columns 5-6 is the count of inpatient hospital admissions with influenza as only diagnosis within a county-year-month. We limit analysis to the influenza intensive months of October through March and our sample spans 2007-2017 with the exception of October 2008 to March 2009 where vaccine e\u0000ectiveness data is not available. Vaccine protection (VP) is weighted by hospitalization shares across age groups and is measured between 0 (low) and 1 (high). The results are from a Poisson GMM estimation with county-by-season-by-year xed e\u0000ects and year-by-month dummies as well as weather controls. Weather controls consist of ve bins of temperature quintiles, ve bins of specic humidity quintiles, and linear terms for precipitation and wind speed. All weather variables are based on county-year-month averages. The air quality index (AQI) is lagged one month and a higher AQI means worse air quality. The Columns in Panel B use our instruments based on wind direction instead of the AQI to generate moment conditions, and even-numbered Columns additionally use our VE instrument instead of VP to form moment conditions. The number of included observations can vary across di\u0000erent outcomes due to xed e\u0000ects and varied counts in each county-year-month cell. Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the county level. the costs of obtaining a vaccine or promote its benets. With this policy lens in mind, we discuss changes in\u00002as the e\u0000ect of a relative increase in vaccine take-up rates. To estimate Equation (5), we use the same Poisson GMM-IV xed e\u0000ects estimator as for Equation (2) with wind direction instruments for the AQI. The moment conditions for our interaction term AQI VPuse the interaction of wind direction instruments with our VEinstrument. Table A.3 in Appendix A.3 shows that our wind instruments interacted with VEshift the interaction term with a Kleibergen- Paap F-stat of 35.3 (Column 3). III. Results and Discussion A. Influenza Hospitalizations Table 1 shows estimates from our Poisson GMM estimations. Coe\u0000cients represent the AQI semi- elasticity of the count of inpatient hospitalizations with primary diagnosis influenza within a county- year-month, or an approximate percentage change in inpatient counts per unit of AQI when estimates 16-1.2 -1-.8-.6-.4-.2 0.2.4.6.811.2Residualized count of influenza admissions -12 -10 -8 -6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 810 12 Residualized AQI (a) Low vaccine protection -1.2 -1-.8-.6-.4-.2 0.2.4.6.811.2Residualized count of influenza admissions -12 -10 -8 -6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 810 12 Residualized AQI (b) High vaccine protection Figure 2: Air quality and vaccine protection Notes: Panels (a) and (b) show binned scatterplots with 30 bins and a linear regression on the underlying data.

The panels show the relationship for below (a) and above (b) median vaccine protection in the sample. are su\u0000ciently small. Estimates from Column 1 in Panel A correspond to Equation 2, without using any instruments, and imply a 1-unit increase in the monthly AQI associates with a 0.76% increase in influenza inpatient admissions. Column 1 in Panel B shows that the estimate is larger when using instruments for the AQI based on wind direction. Given that the non-instrumented estimates containcounty-by-quarter-by-year xed e\u0000ects, they likely control for many potential sources of confounding, such as residential sorting or economic activity. Much of the remaining bias in the non-instrumented estimates is likely due to measurement error. If this error is classical, estimates will be biased to the null, and the IV approach will generate larger (absolute) estimates. Our larger IV estimates are consistent with this, as well as the patterns found in Deryugina et al. (2019). 29Specically, our IV approach nds that a 1-unit increase in the monthly AQI results in a 2.8% increase in influenza inpatient admissions. Toput this estimate into a national context, a one-standard-deviation increase in AQI (10.9-unit increase in our data) amounts to approximately 27,182 (35.7%) additional inpatient hospitalizations for a 6-month influenza season in the U.S. 30 To explore the moderating role of the influenza vaccine, Figure 2 shows the regression-adjusted 29The p-value of Hansen's J-statistic of overidentifying restrictions in Column 1 in Panel A is 0.53, so we cannot reject validity of the model. 30We use the 10.9-unit increase and the coe\u0000cient 0.028 for the relative increase exp(0 .02810.9)\u00001=0 .3569, and multiply it by the average inpatient admissions per county-year-month (4.04), the total number of US county equivalents according to the US Census Bureau (3142) (United States Census Bureau, 2018) and by the 6 months within a influenza season. Note that we are using average admissions across our pre-estimation sample of summary statistics from Table A.2 (4.04), which is lower than the average reported in the estimation sample in Table 1 (6.04), since a count model drops counties with zero valued outcomes within the level of the xed e\u0000ect. This only counts cases with primary diagnosis influenza, making thisestimate of absolute numbers a lower bound. Using hospitalization with any influenza diagnosis (Column 3) doubles theadditional predicted cases because the base of hospital admissions is much larger. 17relationship between AQI and influenza admissions separately in a sample with low vaccine protection in Panel (a) and high vaccine protection in Panel (b). We determine each group using a median vaccine protection (0.21) sample split. The relationship between air quality and admissions rates is positively sloped in Panel (a), indicating that the AQI a\u0000ects flu admissions when the vaccine is a bad strain match and/or vaccine take-up is low. When vaccine protection is high, however, this relationship flattens almost completely, as Panel (b) shows, suggesting an e\u0000ective vaccine with su\u0000cient take-up nullies the relationship between pollution and the flu. This does not imply a high vaccine protection eliminatesall influenza hospitalizations or all pollution-related respiratory hospitalizations. Rather, su\u0000ciently high vaccine e\u0000ectiveness and take-up eliminate those flu hospitalizations directly attributable to the negative shock of pollution. To test for the moderating role of vaccine protection, we present estimates of Equation (5) using our Poisson GMM framework in Table 1. Column 2 in Panel A shows the estimates without using in- struments, and Column 2 in Panel B uses our instruments based on wind direction for the AQI, and our vaccine e\u0000ectiveness instrument (VE) interacted with the wind direction instruments for the inter- action term of AQI and vaccine protection (VP). The instrumented estimates are larger than the non- instrumented estimates by around the same factor as for the non-interacted results in Column 1 in Panel A and B. Vaccine protection substantially moderates pollution-driven influenza cases. Our negative in- teraction coe\u0000cient in Column 2 in Panel B implies that a vaccine protection of 21%, which coincides with the average vaccine protection in our sample (the maximum is 33%), nullies the link between air pollution and influenza hospitalizations. This supports prior evidence of thresholds in influenza vacci-nation where the positive external benets are large enough to almost eliminate influenza spread even at incomplete vaccination take-up and e\u0000ectiveness (Boulier, Datta and Goldfarb, 2007; Ward, 2014). In seasons with poor viral match of the vaccine (see Figure 1c), vaccine protection is substantially lower (see Figure 1d). To compensate for a drop in vaccine e\u0000ectiveness from the median (0.39) to the 25th percentile (0.32), vaccine take-up would need to increase by 18% across all age groups. Table A.6 in Appendix A.3 provides reduced form results where we include vaccine e\u0000ectiveness directly insteadof instrumenting for vaccine protection. In our baseline specications in Columns 1 and 2, we include only cases where the primary diag- nosis is influenza, thus ignoring occurrences of influenza in secondary diagnoses. This likely missessome influenza-related hospitalizations, but is arguably more robust to over-counting cases that might arise by including patients who su\u0000er from di\u0000erent health conditions triggered by air pollution (e.g., asthma) and then happen to be tested for influenza upon hospital admission due to health protocols. To show robustness to di\u0000erent counting strategies, Columns 3 and 4 repeat our analysis counting patients that have any (primary or secondary) influenza diagnosis. This yields an average number of influenza admissions per county-year-month in our estimation sample that is roughly double (11.05) compared 18Table 2: Heterogeneity by age and race Panel A: By age (Poisson GMM-IV) 8 years 9-64 years \u000065 years (1) (2) of AQI 36.51 35.7 35.7 35.5 35.5 Mean of VP - 0.31 - 0.16 - 0.2 Mean of VE - 0.48 - 0.4 - 0.3 Panel B: By race (Poisson GMM-IV) Black/Hispanic White of AQI 37.5 37.5 35.46 35.46 Mean of VP - 0.21 - 0.23 Mean of VE - 0.36 - 0.37 Notes: The dependent variable is the count of inpatient hospital admissions with influenza as primary diagnosis within a county-year- month. The Columns indicate which age (Panel A) or race (Panel B) subgroups are counted in the dependent variable. We limit analysis to the influenza intensive months of October through March and our sample spans 2007-2017 with the exception of October 2008 to March 2009 where vaccine e\u0000ectiveness data is not available. Vaccine protection (VP) is weighted by hospitalization shares across age groups and is measured between 0 (low) and 1 (high). We only use the vaccine take-up rates and raw vaccine e\u0000ectiveness for the age groups indicated in each Column in Panel A. For the results by racial groups in Panel B, we use our VP scaled by the ratio of race specic to overall vaccine take-up by season. The results are from Poisson GMM-IV estimations with county-by-season-by-year xed e\u0000ects and year-by-month dummies as well as weather controls. Weather controls consist of ve bins of temperature quintiles, ve bins of specic humidity quintiles, and linear terms for precipitation and wind speed. All weather variables are based on county-year-month averages. The air quality index (AQI) is lagged one month and a higher AQI means worse air quality. The results use our instruments based on wind direction instead of the AQI to generate moment conditions, and even-numbered Columns additionally use our VE instrument instead of VP to form moment conditions. The number of included observations can vary across di\u0000erent outcomes due to xed e\u0000ects and varied counts in each county-year-month cell. Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the county level. to our baseline approach (6.04). The estimated coe\u0000cients, which again reflect semi-elasticities, are close to baseline results both for the level e\u0000ect of AQI as well as the interaction with vaccine e\u0000ective- ness. In Columns 5 and 6, we use a more restrictive condition by counting hospital admissions where the only diagnosis is influenza. This reduces the average count of admissions per county-year-month to 0.81 (the majority of influenza hospital admissions have further influenza-induced complications, e.g., pneumonia). The estimated coe\u0000cients are again comparable to our baseline estimates, though with larger standard errors given the considerable drop in sample size due to more cells with zero counts. Table 2 explores heterogeneity by age and race using our Poisson GMM-IV specications (we show non-instrumented results in Table A.7 in Appendix A.3).31Columns 1 through 6 in Panel A show 31For our regressions with age-specic outcomes in Table 2, we only use the vaccine take-up rate and raw vaccine e\u0000ec- tiveness data of the corresponding age groups for constructing our overall measure of vaccine protection (VP) and vaccine 19results for three distinct age groups: up to age 8, age 9 through 64, and age of at least 65 years, where the rst and last reflect the more vulnerable groups.32Patterns across the youngest and oldest groups are similar to each other and consistent with our main results. The interaction with vaccine protection for the middle age group, however, is imprecise and positive. A positive point estimate on the interaction term implies that vaccines do not help reduce influenza hospitalizations due to air pollution, but can still reduce influenza hospitalizations not driven by air pollution. The condence intervals are large, however, and overlap with the condence intervals of the other age groups, so we draw little inference from this age group estimate. Estimates are similar across racial and ethnic groups (Blacks/Hispanics and Whites in Columns 1 to 4 in Panel B), with overlapping condence intervals.33Combining these results with well-established racial and ethnic di\u0000erences in pollution exposure (Banzhaf, Timmins, 2019; Colmer et al., 2020; Currie, Voorheis and Walker, 2020) may help explain the higher influenza burdens experienced by those communities (e.g. Quinn et al., 2011). As such, our results suggest that air quality control could be an additional policy lever to help reduce severe influenza cases among these vulnerable groups, particularly within those communities in which vaccine access is limited and reluctance to receive the vaccine is particularly high.34 Although we focus primarily on inpatient hospital admissions for influenza, Table 3 shows estimates of the e\u0000ect of air pollution and vaccines on two alternative outcomes: emergency department (ED) visits and mortality. ED visits may pick up less severe cases of the flu, though visiting the ED can be plagued by selection concerns since they are more likely to serve as a source of primary care for groupswith limited access to health care (Finkelstein et al., 2012). Despite the fact that our data on ED visits has slightly di\u0000erent geographical and temporal coverage than the data for inpatient hospitalizations, the estimates are close to our main results. In Columns 5 to 8 we instead look at influenza deaths, which are less frequent than inpatient hospitalizations but also less subject to selection concerns. 35The estimates for mortality also show a similar pattern to our main results. Together, these suggest that air pollution, and the protective role of vaccines, each a\u0000ect a wide range of flu case severity. In Table 4 we perform three further tests. First, Columns 1 and 2 explore robustness to functional form by using a linear mean function, closer to standard OLS, in place of the exponential mean function e\u0000ectiveness (VE). We show means of VP and VE for each regression at the bottom of the table. We note that vaccines have private and external benets, so vaccine take-up of any one group generates positive spillovers to other groups. 32We dene these age splits based on the age splits available in the vaccine e\u0000ectiveness measures. 33We adjust vaccine protection by the seasonal ratio of vaccine take-up of the particular ethnic group to overall vaccine take-up, which results in a slightly higher mean of VP for Whites, as reported in the bottom of the table. 34These benets are in addition to any improvements in pollution-related health not associated with influenza. See Deryug- ina et al. (2021) for a discussion of policy targeting regarding polluted areas and vulnerable people. 35Since the data on mortality covers the entire U.S., these results also improve the representativeness of our main ndings. The estimation sample size reported in the table is only slightly higher than for our main results because the mortality outcomehas more zeros resulting in more observations being dropped by the count model. 20Table 3: The e\u0000ect of air pollution and vaccines on emergency department visits and mortality ED visits Mortality Poisson GMM Poisson GMM-IV Poisson GMM Poisson 0.21 - 0.21 - 0.2 - 0.2 Mean of VE - 0.37 - 0.37 - 0.35 - 0.35 Notes: The dependent variable is the count of emergency department visits (in Columns 1 to 4) or the count of deaths (in Columns 5 to 6), all with influenza as primary diagnosis within a county-year-month. We limit analysis to the influenza intensive months of October through March and our sample spans 2007-2017 with the exception of October 2008 to March 2009 where vaccine e\u0000ectiveness data is not available. Vaccine protection (VP) is weighted by hospitalization shares across age groups and is measured between 0 (low) and 1 (high). We only use the vaccine take-up rates and raw vaccine e\u0000ectiveness for the age groups indicated in each Column. For the results by racial groups, we use our VP scaled by the ratio of race specic to overall vaccine take-up by season. The results are from Poisson GMM-IV estimations with county-by-season-by-year xed e\u0000ects and year-by-month dummies as well as weather controls. Weather controls consist of ve bins of temperature quintiles, ve bins of specic humidity quintiles, and linear terms for precipitation and wind speed. All weather variables are based on county-year-month averages. The air quality index (AQI) is lagged one month and a higher AQI means worse air quality. The results are from a Poisson GMM estimation with county-by-season-by-year xed e\u0000ects and year-by-month dummies as well as weather controls. Weather controls consist of ve bins of temperature quintiles, ve bins of specic humidity quintiles, and linear terms for precipitation and wind speed. All weather variables are based on county-year-month averages. The air quality index (AQI) is lagged one month and a higher AQI means worse air quality. The Columns indicating \"GMM-IV\" use our instruments based on wind direction instead of the AQI to generate moment conditions, and even-numbered Columns additionally use our VE instrument instead of VP to form moment conditions. The number of included observations can vary across di\u0000erent outcomes due to xed e\u0000ects and varied counts in each county-year-month cell. Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the county level. consistent with a Poisson count model. Columns 1 and 2 in Panel A show a linear GMM model without instruments (OLS), for a linear version of Columns 1 and 2 in Panel A of Table 1. Columns 1 and 2 in Panel B show the IV as a linear version of Columns 1 and 2 in Panel B of Table 1 . As in our baseline Poisson GMM model, the IV estimates in Panel B are around three times larger than those inPanel B. Since the point estimates now reflect level e\u0000ects, we divide by the mean of the dependent variable to obtain percent e\u0000ects that are more readily comparable to the estimates from the count model. Doing so, the linear estimate in Column 1 in Panel B of 0.18 translates to a 3% e\u0000ect, whichis very close to the estimate of 2.8% using the count model. Vaccine protection is also comparable in magnitude. In Appendix Table A.8, we show equivalence of our Poisson GMM estimator (without instruments) with a Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood estimator, and we estimate a linear model using the inverse hyperbolic sine (IHS) of hospitalizations as our outcome. The estimates using the IHS are similar to semi-elasticities (but, unlike the log function, allow for zeros) and can therefore be more directly compared with our baseline Poisson GMM estimates. The e\u0000ect of 0.02 in Column 7 inAppendix Table A.8 is close to our baseline e\u0000ect of 0.028 in Table 1. Together, these results suggest that our estimates are largely insensitive to the functional form choice of our dependent variable. Second, we ask how the e\u0000ect of air pollution on influenza hospitalization compares to the e\u0000ect on any respiratory hospitalization (including influenza) in Columns 3 and 4. Here we continue to use the 21Table 4: Linear specication, all respiratory hospitalizations, and osteoarthritis as falsication test Influenza All respiratory hospitalizations hospitalizations Osteoarthritis Panel A: No instruments Linear GMM Linear GMM Poisson GMM (1) (2) (3) (4) -0.00054 Linear GMM-IV GMM-IV (1) 0.21 - 0.21 Mean of VE - 0.36 - 0.37 - 0.37 Notes: The dependent variable is the count of inpatient hospitalizations with influenza as primary diagnosis in Columns 1 and 2, the count of inpatient hospitalizations with any respiratory primary diagnosis in Columns 3 and 4, and the count of inpatient hospitalizations with osteoarthritis as primary diagnosis in Columns 5 and 6, all at the county-year-month level. We limit analysis to the influenza intensive months of October through March and our sample spans 2007-2017 with the exception of October 2008 to March 2009 where vaccine e\u0000ectiveness data is not available. Vaccine protection (VP) is weighted by hospitalization shares across age groups and is measured between 0 (low) and 1 (high). The results are from a Linear GMM estimation in Columns 1 to 4 and from a Poisson GMM estimation in Columns 5 and 6, all with county-by-season-by-year xed e\u0000ects and year-by-month dummies as well as weather controls. Weather controls consist of ve bins of temperature quintiles, ve bins of specic humidity quintiles, and linear terms for precipitation and wind speed. All weather variables are based on county-year-month averages. The air quality index (AQI) is lagged one month and a higher AQI means worse air quality. Panel B uses our instruments based on wind direction instead of the AQI to generate moment conditions, and even-numbered Columns additionally use our VE instrument instead of VP to form moment conditions. The number of included observations can vary across di\u0000erent outcomes due to xed e\u0000ects and varied counts in each county-year-month cell. Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the county level. linear models from Columns 1 and 2, which has the benet of making direct level e\u0000ect comparisons, unlike the Poisson model, which provides relative percentage e\u0000ects. As indicated in Table 4, the mean of hospitalizations with any respiratory hospitalization per county-year-month (141.32) is much higher than for influenza hospitalizations alone (6.04). Panel A shows the e\u0000ect on all respiratory hospitaliza-tions without instruments and Panel B with instruments. 36The absolute e\u0000ect of a one-unit increase of the AQI on influenza hospitalizations (0.18, Column 1 in Panel B) is roughly one-third of the size of the e\u0000ect on all respiratory hospitalizations (0.5, Column 3 in Panel B).37Assuming that outside of in- fluenza season the e\u0000ect on all respiratory hospitalizations remains the same, but the e\u0000ect on influenza hospitalizations drops to zero, influenza hospitalizations due to air pollution accounts for roughly 18% of all respiratory hospitalizations due to air pollution. This suggests that the increased incidence of in- 36A negative but noisy interaction e\u0000ect on all respiratory hospitalizations in Column 4 in Panel B is consistent with our vaccine e\u0000ects, as the majority of hospitalizations for respiratory diseases are unrelated to influenza (e.g., asthma). 37This is further corroborated when comparing the e\u0000ect of air pollution on influenza with all other diagnoses groupings in Appendix Figure A.6. 22fluenza accounts for a sizeable share of the health harms from air pollution. It also implies that greater vaccine strain matches and increased take-up rates can reduce a sizeable share of hospitalizations from air pollution. Third, as a general specication test for our model, we perform a falsication test by repeating our analysis using an outcome we do not expect to be related to pollution or vaccines. We choose to narrowour focus to osteoarthritis, which is unlikely to be related to short-term variation in pollution. Our Poisson GMM-IV results in Column 5 and 6 in Panel B of Table 4 indicate precise zero coe\u0000cients on thee\u0000ect of AQI and the interaction with vaccine protection, lending support to our model specication. As a more comprehensive test, Appendix Figures A.6, A.7 and A.8 show our Poisson GMM-IV estimates for all ICD disease groupings separately, as long as there are su\u0000cient number of cases in those diseases. 38 Compared to all other disease outcomes, we nd that influenza hospitalizations are most a\u0000ected by the AQI in relative terms.39The vast majority of disease outcomes is associated with a precise zero e\u0000ect, similar to osteoarthritis. There are some diagnoses where we nd that AQI increases hospitalizations (Figure A.6), such as acute bronchitis, perinatal conditions (often includes respiratory conditions), or diabetes (known to increase influenza risk (Allard et al., 2010)). Adjusting for the family wise error rate for multiple hypothesis testing renders all results insignicant, except those for our influenza outcome. As an expansion to our wind instrumental variables, we explore an additional source of variation by using inversions in Appendix Table A.9. In Columns 1 and 2 we use only inversions (without using instruments based on wind direction). The coe\u0000cients are similar as in our main results in Table 1, with overlapping condence intervals. We next use both the inversion and wind based sets of instruments in Columns 3 and 4, again with estimates close to our main results.40These patterns lend support to the validity of our model design, and demonstrate that our IV estimates are not a unique feature of our measure of wind direction in the rst stage. Finally, Table A.10 in Appendix A.3 explores further robustness of our main Poisson GMM-IV results to changes in control variables, calculation of AQI, or including o\u0000-seasonal cases. In Columns 1 and 2,we replace our county-by-season-by-year xed e\u0000ects with coarser county-by-influenza season e\u0000ects. In Columns 3 and 4 we drop all weather controls. In Columns 5 and 6 we use the full controls and additionally include lagged employment at the county-year-month level to control for economic activity at our level of analysis. In Columns 7 and 8 we do not winsorize the AQI, and in Columns 9 and 10 38We focus on disease groupings that have at least half as many occurances as influenza. This implies a threshold mean of at least 3.02 in our outcome variable, half the mean of our influenza outcome (6.04). Including additional low occurrence diseases conrms the pattern shown in the gures. 39Note that our estimate is in relative terms due to the exponential mean function. It is possible that the estimate in absolute terms is higher for other diseases, such as acute bronchitis, due to higher baseline prevalence. 40The test of overidentifying restrictions is rejected at the 5% level, both when using inversion instruments alone and when using inversions and wind instruments jointly. The test for overidentifying restrictions is passed only with instruments basedon wind direction alone as in our main results. This together with the lower rst stage F-stat for inversion instruments drivesusing soley wind direction instruments as main results. 23we do not spatially interpolate the AQI. In Columns 11 and 12 we additionally include all county-year- month cells with positive influenza hospitalization cases. The estimates remain similar to our main estimates. B. Medical Costs Given the above e\u0000ects, we calculate the additional hospital costs and charges attributable to pollution- associated influenza to assess the costs generated by air pollution and the role of vaccine protection inmitigating those costs. 41We use hospital costs as the dependent variable in Table 5, showing only results using instruments, with non-instrumented results presented in Appendix Table A.11, and results using hospital charges instead of costs in Appendix Table A.12. Column 1 in Panel A indicates that a one-unit increase in the AQI corresponds to a $US 1,595 increase in hospital costs from hospitalizations with primary diagnosis influenza. This implies that a one-standard-deviation decrease in AQI (10.9 points) reduces hospitalization costs by $US 328 million per influenza season across the entire U.S. Column 2 in Panel A shows the interaction e\u0000ect with vaccine protection, and Columns 1 and 2 in Panel B use a Poisson model instead of a linear model. Since the e\u0000ect is a relative e\u0000ect in Panel B, the estimates are reassuringly close to our estimates in Columns 1 and 2 in Panel B in Table 1 where we use the count of hospitalizations as outcome.42 We can use the results in Column 2 in Panel A to further illustrate our main results in terms of addi- tional hospital costs. When VP is high (maximum is 0.33), an increase in AQI has no noticeable impact onflu-specic hospitalization costs due to the protective nature of the vaccine. In contrast, when VP is low, even small changes in the AQI generate large increases in additional influenza-specic hospital- ization costs. Going from an AQI of 40 to 50 (both of which are well below US regulatory standards) generates roughly 455 million $US in additional influenza inpatient hospitalization costs at a vaccine protection of 0.086, the minimum in our sample.43Conversely, when air quality is high (AQI< 20), a drop in VP generates little additional pollution-driven influenza hospitalization costs (though influenza cases that are not pollution driven still might be greatly a\u0000ected). On the other hand, when air quality approaches an AQI of 70 (which is still relatively clean by WHO standards), VP is highly impactful. In particular, a drop in vaccine protection from its median (0.21) to the 25th percentile (0.16), generates around 166 million $US in additional pollution-driven influenza costs when AQI is at the low end of 41We use deflated hospital charges with base year 2018, and combine them with the HCUP (2018b) provided Cost-to- Charge Ratios to convert them into hospital costs. Hospital charges are around $US 29 thousand per patient per influenza diagnosed inpatient hospitalization, but actual costs to hospitals are lower at around $US 8 thousand per patient (Appendix Table A.2). Further, these estimates ignore indirect costs to patients, such as forgone earnings. 42Note that we have an equally high share of zeros regardless of whether we use hospital costs or count of hospitalizations as our outcome measure. The better t of an exponential (Poisson) model to data with large shares of zeros may explain why the Poisson based estimates in Panel B are slightly more precise than those based on the linear model in Panel A. 43Calculated as 10 \u00b7(3117\u00000.08 \u00b78794) = 24 ,135$US per county-month, multiplied by 3142 counties and 6 months. 24Table 5: Total hospitalization costs, length of stay, and costs per day Length of stay Total costs in days Costs per day Panel A: Linear GMM-IV (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) 15.3 Panel of AQI 35.28 35.29 35.29 35.28 35.28 Mean of VP - 0.21 - 0.21 - 0.21 Mean of VE - 0.36 - 0.36 - 0.36 Notes: The dependent variable are hospital costs for inpatient hospitalizations with influenza as primary diagnosis, length of stay in days, or costs per day. We limit analysis to the influenza intensive months of October through March and our sample spans 2007-2017 with the exception of October 2008 to March 2009 where vaccine e\u0000ectiveness data is not available. Vaccine protection (VP) is weighted by hospitalization shares across age groups and is measured between 0 (low) and 1 (high). The results are from a Linear GMM estimation in Panel A and from a Poisson GMM estimation in Panel B, all with county-by-season-by-year xed e\u0000ects and year-by-month dummies as well as weather controls. Weather controls consist of ve bins of temperature quintiles, ve bins of specic humidity quintiles, and linear terms for precipitation and wind speed. All weather variables are based on county-year-month averages. The air quality index (AQI) is lagged one month and a higher AQI means worse air quality. All results use our instruments based on wind direction instead of the AQI to generate moment conditions, and even-numbered Columns additionally use our VE instrument instead of VP to form moment conditions. Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the county level. our sample range and around 580 million $US at the high end of the pollution range.44 We also decompose the e\u0000ect on total costs into two of its three components, the e\u0000ect on length of stay in days (Columns 3 and 4 of Table 5) and costs per day (Columns 5 and 6).45Examining these two outcomes may also help to shed some light on whether pollution is likely to increase severity or spread of flu. Our results show a positive but statistically insignicant increase in length of stay, and a statistically signicant increase in costs per day. We interpret these results as supporting the idea that pollution leads to more intense cases of the flu, i.e., it increases severity. We note, however, that we cannot properly disentangle the spread versus severity story, as we only observe the joint outcome of likelihood of hospitalization, and not the two separate components (the likelihood of catching the fluor the likelihood of hospitalization conditional on catching the flu). 46 A back of the envelope calculation based on realizations within our dataset may help place our esti- mates in a more useful context. Our results suggest that a 10% (3.5 AQI points) reduction in the AQI in 44Calculated as 20 \u00b7(0.05 \u00b78794) = 8 ,794and70 \u00b7(0.05 \u00b78794) = 30 ,779, both multiplied by 3142 counties and 6 months. 45The third component is the number of hospitalizations per county-month as in Table 4 in Columns 1 and 2 in Panel B. 46Admitting more marginally sick people, for example, could undermine this exercise. 25a historically bad vaccine e\u0000ectiveness year (17% VE and 11% VP) would avert 12,607 (16.6%) hospital- izations across the U.S. or $US 109 million in influenza medical costs.47In contrast, a 10% improvement in either vaccine take-up or vaccine e\u0000ectiveness from average vaccine take-up or e\u0000ectiveness in a historically polluted year (38.2 AQI) would avert 26,378 (34.6%) of pollution driven influenza hospi- talizations, or $US 211 million. C. Policy Implications Since the marginal benet from improving either VP or air quality decreases in the level of the othervariable, vaccine and air quality policies can serve as substitutes in preventing pollution-induced in- fluenza cases. 48The optimal mix of those policies will depend on their relative costs on the margin as well as the 'spillover' impacts each may have on harms beyond influenza. It is also worth noting that these policies can operate on di\u0000erent time scales adding an additional dimension to the trade-o\u0000s across each policy. For example, reducing pollution emissions requires investments in capital equip- ment and takes considerable time, but informational approaches that promote vaccine take-up can bear fruit much more quickly. Regardless of the specics, recognizing the interaction of these two policies broadens the toolkit to address the harms from either one of them, and thus necessarily allows one toobtain a given set of policy objectives at (weakly) lower costs. The interaction of vaccine take-up and air quality policies also highlights new potential benets from improved targeting of either policy. Given the seasonality of the flu, air quality policies could betime-varying. 49Given our nding that influenza hospitalizations account for a signicant share of all respiratory hospitalizations from pollution, more stringent air quality policies in influenza months may be particularly impactful.50 Programs to promote vaccine take-up can also be targeted toward vulnerable communities based on socio-demographic risk factors. Using time-averaged data on vaccine take-up by state and race, air quality by county, and socio-demographic county characteristics on median household income and race from Chetty et al. (2018) and the U.S. Census, we ask what an increase of 10% in the overall vaccine take- up average (a 4.6 percentage point increase) achieves when targeted at di\u0000erent types of counties.51 47We calculate averted medical costs by multiplying the number of averted hospitalizations by the average costs per in- fluenza hospitalization (US$ 8 thousand). 48In the event that air quality improvements reduce the spread of the flu, the two policies may serve as complements rather than substitutes under certain conditions. For example, if the reproductive rate of flu is above 1 even with vaccine protection, but falls below 1 when combined with air quality policy, then the two policies may be complements. We thank Ben Olken forraising this point. 49We thank Douglas Almond for raising this point. 50Seasonal air quality policies are not without precedent. For example, the NOx cap-and-trade program in the U.S. only operates between May and September when ozone tends to be highest (Deschenes, Greenstone and Shapiro, 2017). 51We calculate the average vaccine take-up by county using vaccine take-up rates by race and white, Black, Hispanic, and Asian population shares by county. Our calculations account for the joint statistical relationships between vaccine-take up,race, pollution exposure, and income. 26Specically, we examine di\u0000erences between the top and bottom 1% of U.S. counties in terms of racial population shares and median income, and use our estimated coe\u0000cients to compare the benets of a 4.6 percentage point increase in vaccine take-up across these scenarios.52 Increasing vaccine take-up in a county with high versus low Black population shares reduces hos- pitalizations and associated costs by 40.7% versus 26.8%. The di\u0000erence is substantial, since pollutionexposure is higher and vaccine take-up lower in communities with higher shares of Black residents. Interestingly, we nd little di\u0000erence in results when stratifying by income. Targeting a high incomeversus a low income county reduces pollution-induced influenza hospitalizations and associated costs by 36.4% versus 38.0%. Correlations in our data suggest that these e\u0000ects are similar due to two o\u0000- setting forces. High income counties tend to include major cities, which are more polluted than more rural areas (increasing the benets of vaccine-take up), but also have higher baseline vaccine take-up rates (decreasing the benets). To some degree, this supports the conjecture that air quality controls and vaccine take-up can serve as substitutes. IV. Conclusion Using a rich, longitudinal dataset, we provide evidence that air pollution increases seasonal influenzahospitalization rates, and that improved vaccine protection, either through high vaccine e\u0000ectiveness or vaccine take-up, greatly diminishes this relationship and reduces the social and medical costs of poor air quality. Our empirical strategy, based on instrumental variables using wind direction and the stochastic nature of vaccine e\u0000ectiveness across influenza seasons, limits risks of confounding. Our results are robust to numerous assumptions about functional form, omitted variables, alternative outcomes, and falsication tests. That policies to combat air quality can protect citizens from the most serious threats of influenza is a new insight that o\u0000ers an additional tool in the global battle against the flu. At the same time, itappears that increased flu vaccination rates and improvements in flu vaccine strain matches can avertsome of the harms from pollution. As such, the returns to policies designed to address pollution and infection externalities are inextricably connected, such that approaching either in isolation will be sub- optimal from a social welfare perspective. Thus, optimal policy strategies can help decrease medical spending, avoid lost productivity, and reduce loss of life. These returns may be particularly high indense urban centers around the world, and developing countries in particular, where population den- sity and high levels of pollution (de Lataillade, Auvergne and Delannoy, 2009) increase the intensity of these interactions. Our insights regarding compounding risks from pollution and flu may extend to other viral respi- 52We use the median county AQI and vaccine-take up rate in the bottom and top 1% of counties. 27ratory illnesses with similar etiological pathways. For example research on the COVID-19 pandemic suggests signicant e\u0000ects of pollution on COVID-19 cases and deaths (Wu et al., 2020; Isphording and Pestel, 2021).53While vaccine developments aid against such health threats, new strains and viruses may emerge that diminish such protection. Our results suggest an additional possible policy direction, whereby environmental controls serve as an investment to optimally manage the harms from new viral threats if e\u0000ective vaccines are not available, while also providing additional protection against moreestablished respiratory infections that may drain the healthcare system during times of crises.

Figure A.1 plots distributions of several socio- demographic variables for the counties in our HCUP data and for all U.S. counties. The graphs show similar distributions suggesting that the subset of HCUP counties is broadly representative of U.S. coun-ties. Table A.2 contains summary statistics at the county-year-month level for inpatient hospital admis- sions with a primary influenza diagnosis, associated hospital charges, and the average monthly AQI. We use the standard deviation of the AQI during the influenza season (10.9), the average inpatient hospitalization admissions (4.04) and cost (32 thousand US$) for the calculation of absolute e\u0000ects based on our Poisson GMM-IV estimates (implying 8 thousand US$ per patient). Hospital charges are slightly higher than costs (117 thousand US$). To further illustrate the influenza seasonality, we use data on the timing of national influenza-like illnesses from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2020). Figure A.2 shows that the seasonality of inpatient hospitalizations in our data matches closely with general influenza-like illnesses reported by the CDC. The AQI is based on multiple pollutants, but for each county-day, a single pollutant is the dening pollutant of the AQI (EPA, 2018). Figure A.3 shows which pollutants are the main dening pollutants of the AQI during the influenza season from October through March for three di\u0000erent intervals coveringour sample. Particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and ozone are the dening pollutants in the AQI for the majority of cases in each time period.

A-5A.2 Econometric details In this section we detail how we estimate our Poisson GMM-IV model with xed e\u0000ects. To simplify notation, we index observations by iand collect all variables on the right hand side of Equation (2) into Xiexcept the xed e\u0000ects \u0000j iat the county-by-year-by-month level jwith total observations J=P i2j per xed e\u0000ect cell. The conditional mean Hiis given by: E[Hi|Xi,\u0000j i]=g(Xi\u0000+\u0000j i)=j iexp(Xi\u0000) (7) whereXiare the AQI, control variables, as well as year by month dummies. In our baseline expo- nentional mean speciciation consistent with a Poisson count model, the function g(.)is the exponential function exp(.), such that we can rewrite g(Xi\u0000+\u0000j i)=j iexp(Xi\u0000), where j i=g(\u0000j i). In our linear mean specication, the function g(.)is just a linear function, i.e. the argument itself. We use a general methods of moments (GMM) estimator using standard moment conditions: E[i|Zi]=0 (8) whereZiare instruments and ithe errors. Note that we do not require any additional distributional assumptions for consistency of \u0000, only that the conditional mean function is correctly specied and that our moment conditions hold. When our instruments Ziare the variables themselves (X i), our GMM estimator is numerically equivalent to a standard xed e\u0000ects Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood (PPML) estimator. i=J\u00001P hos- pitalizations within a county-season-year cell jcorresponding to the level of our county-year-season xed e\u0000ect \u0000j i, i.e. averaging across months in each cell. Next, note that \u0000j iorj idoes not vary across observations iat the \u00afgj i(\u0000)|Xi,\u0000j i# (10) Combining Equations (7), (8) and (10) yields an expression for the moment conditions that re- A-6moves the xed function of \u0000, it needs to be recomputed in every iteration of the GMM algorithm. Dening residuals as i, the (13) whereW=(1 NZ0Z)\u00001is a weighting matrix. We compute clustered standard errors using the covariance matrix of \u0000: VCO In our empirical application, we use a xed e\u0000ect demeaned version of our instrument matrix Zito match the instruments that would be used in a two stage least squares regression, which we denote Zi=Zi\u0000J\u00001P i2jZi.54We use a two-step optimal GMM procedure where we use S\u00001from the rst step as weighting matrix for the second step. Finally, for robustness checks, we use a linear conditional mean function instead of an exponential conditional mean function where Hiis either the count of hospitalizations or the inverse hyperbolic sine (IHS) of hospitalizations counts: E[Hi|Xi,\u0000j i]=Xi\u0000+\u0000j i (15) This changes the moment conditions in Equation (11) to a standard mean-di\u0000erenced version for linear GMM: E[i|Zi]=Eh (Hi\u0000\u00afHj whether we use ZiorZi.

Columns (1), (4) and (7) show the results from our model with one endogenous variables (without interacting with VP) in Equation (2). The other Columns show rst stage results from our model with two endogenous variables (with interacting with VP) in Equation (5). The dependent variables are the endogenous variables indicated at the top of the table. In Columns (1) to (3) we use our instruments based on wind directions. In Columns (4) to (6) we use our instruments based on thermal inversions. In Columns (7) to (9) we use our both our instruments based on wind directions and thermal inversions. We limit analysis to the influenza intensive months of October through March and our sample spans 2007-2017 with the exception of October 2008 to March 2009 where vaccine e\u0000ectiveness data is not available. Vaccine e\u0000ectiveness is weighted by average vaccination rates and hospitalization shares across age groups and is measured between 0 (low) and 1 (high). The results are from a Ordinary Least Squares regression with county-by-season-by-year and year-by-month xed e\u0000ects as well as weather controls. Weather controls consist of ve bins of temperature quintiles, ve bins of specic humidity quintiles, and linear terms for precipitation and wind speed. All weather variables are based on county-year-month averages. Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the county level. A-8Table A.4: Monte Carlo simulation on convergence of rst stage coe\u0000cients to one Bias of rst stage coe\u0000cients Number Number of counties of years 25 50 100 200 500 1000 3000 4 table shows a Monte Carlo simulation of the maximum bias in the rst stage coe\u0000cients in the model with one endogenous variables (without interacting with VP) in Equation (2). The bias estimates are created by simulating a dataset with the number of years and counties as indicated with 6 months per year. We populate the data randomly with AQI values, based on a normal distribution with mean and variance of our original data, and winsorizing the maximum and minimum to the maximum and minimum from our original AQI data. We randomly populate the data with wind direction bins from a uniform distribution from 1.1 to 4.1, which we then round to the nearest integer, such that there are four bins and some wind direction bins WindDirBin occur more frequently (but randomly across the entire sample). To generate some correlation between AQI and wind direction bins, we multiply the AQI with log(WindDirBin +1.5) (log(CountyIndicator +2 )/3)for the rst and with 1/log(WindDirBin +1.5)(log(CountyIndicator +2 )/3)for the second half of counties. We then calculate the instrument as described in our paper, and run rst stage regressions based on Equation (2 omitting all control variables, except our xed e\u0000ects. We note the maximum percentage deviation from any of the coe\u0000cients of the instruments in the rst stage as (1/\u0000\u00001)100%. We repeat the simulation 20 times for each county-year conguration and show the average of the maximum percentage deviation in the above table. The table shows that as either the number of counties, or the number ofyears increases, the rst stage coe\u0000cients converge to one. The exact size of the deviations are not directly comparable to our estimates, as we are, for example, including control variables, but the convergence patterns should apply.

We limit analysis to the influenza intensive months of October through March and our sample spans 2007-2017 with the exception of October 2008 to March 2009 where vaccine e\u0000ectiveness data is not available. Instead of using vaccine protection (VP), we use vaccine e\u0000ectiveness (VE) directly. Vaccine e\u0000ectiveness is weighted by average vaccination rates and hospitalization shares across age groups and is measured between 0 (low) and 1 (high). The results are from a Poisson-GMM estimation with county-by-season-by-year xed e\u0000ects and year-by- month dummies as well as weather controls. Weather controls consist of ve bins of temperature quintiles, ve bins of specic humidity quintiles, and linear terms for precipitation and wind speed. All weather variables are based on county-year-month averages. The air quality index (AQI) is lagged one month and a higher AQI means worse air quality. The Columns indicating \"GMM-IV\" use our instruments based on wind direction instead of the AQI to generate moment conditions, and in even-numbered Columns use the interaction between wind direction instruments and vaccine e\u0000ectiveness (VE). Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the county level.

We limit analysis to the influenza intensive months of October through March and our sample spans 2007-2017 with the exception of October 2008 to March 2009 where vaccine e\u0000ectiveness data is not available. Vaccine protection (VP) is weighted by hospitalization shares across age groups and is measured between 0 (low) and 1 (high). We only use the vaccine take-up rates and raw vaccine e\u0000ectiveness for the age groups indicated in each Column. For the results by racial groups, we use our VP scaled by the ratio of race specic to overall vaccine take-up by season. The results are from Poisson GMM estimations without instruments with county-by-season-by-year xed e\u0000ects and year-by-month dummies as well as weather controls. Weather controls consist of ve bins of temperature quintiles, ve bins of specic humidity quintiles, and linear terms for precipitation and wind speed. All weather variables are based on county-year-month averages. The air quality index (AQI) is lagged one month and a higher AQI means worse air quality. The number of included observations can vary across di\u0000erent outcomes due to xed e\u0000ects and varied counts in each county-year-month cell.

We limit analysis to the influenza intensive months of October through March and our sample spans 2007-2017 with the exception of October 2008 to March 2009 where vaccine e\u0000ectiveness data is not available. Vaccine protection (VP) is weighted by hospitalization shares across age groups and is measured between 0 (low) and 1 (high). The results are from a Poisson GMM estimation in Columns 1 and 2, from a Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood (PPML) in Columns 3 and 4, and from a linear GMM estimation in Columns (5) to (8), all with county-by-season-by-year xed e\u0000ects and year-by-month dummies as well as weather controls.
