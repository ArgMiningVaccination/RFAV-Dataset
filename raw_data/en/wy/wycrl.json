Acupuncture is an ancient art of healing that dates back to at least 2,500 years. It has been widely practiced in China and many other Asian countries. Only recently has acupuncture made its way into the western world. Acupuncture accentuates on the natural healing of the body. It Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese practice, in which tiny filament needles are inserted at strategic points of the body to treat conditions ranging from headaches and neck pain to fibromyalgia. The needles provoke the release of endorphins and other hormones in the body; promoting enhanced circulation and a noticeable reduction in pain and inflammation. A wide range of treatments exists under the umbrella term of 'complementary therapy'. Each treatment has its own unique theory and practice, which makes it difficult to offer a Acupuncture uses tiny, sterile needles to stimulate acupoints or areas of the body that are believed to stimulate self-healing (University of California San Diego Center for Integrative Medicine [UCSD], 2017). Traditional Chinese medicine has used the technique of acupuncture for over 3,000 years (UCSD, 2017). The scientific explanation of the effects that acupuncture has on the body relates to the needles stimulating \"the nervous system to release chemicals\" that can either \"change the experience of pain\" or \"influence the body's internal regulating system\" (American Academy of Medical Acupuncture [AAMA], 2017). It is used to treat many different conditions and is not considered to be very painful. Frequent interpretation of the results from the GERAC shows a clear advantage of both real and sham acupuncture over conventional therapy, which implies that acupuncture is a useful intervention without doubt. Approximately 50% of patients in real and sham acupuncture groups experienced therapeutic effects whereas only 25% of patients Aromatherapy has expanded enormously since the 1970s but what continues to matter is the enhancement of individuals comfort especially patient's symptoms who have an advanced progressive condition from essential oils. This is what encourages more in depth knowledge into this area. In this essay, I will determine how and to what extent aromatherapy should be tested to see its scientific validity. Science is ever changing, hypothesis built on top on ranging hypotheses, theory after theory continually being ratified and disproved, never-ending ideas of experiments, case studies, and surveys; these all furthering of human understanding of this world. Mainstream science can also often be classified as pseudoscience because it has hence been disproven, but not to the extent where the general public accepts or even realizes its apocryphalness. Aromatherapy is partially under this category because there is no definitive research proving either way because of the challenges in research, but in order to be determined scientifically This process results in deactivation of the sympathetic nervous system, reducing the body's overall state of stress and excitability, and improving the patient's sense of well-being\" (Hamlin 2017). Aromatherapy causes the release of endorphins and serotonin and can potentially have an effect on every system in the body. A common essential oil that has been effective in reducing pain is lavender. Aromatherapy can be used in a variety of routes including inhalation, topical application or diffusion. Music therapy has many therapeutic effects including decreasing anxiety, improving mood, decreasing heart rate as well as blood pressure, and decreasing the perception of pain. Using the technique of guided imagery, the patient should focus on positive images to distract themselves from their pain. The process of acupuncture is invasive, and patients may shy away from it because of this. In acupuncture, specific points are stimulated in order to unblock a persons 'qi' or chi (Hamlin 2017). Acupressure is similar to Many people shy away from trying acupuncture because they don't know how it works, there's no visible proof. Even though acupuncture doesn't require taking a pill or being injected with medicine, it does have positive effects on many people. The human body has approximately 800 to 1000 acupuncture points (Dr. Michael). These points were found through ancient Chinese medicine theories and are where the needles are inserted into the body. Each point has a specific purpose and name. These points lie on one of the body's fourteen meridians which run from head to toe and connect to the body's organ systems (Dr. Dorel). The body is a matrix of electromagnetic energy which flows through the fourteen meridians (Acupuncture). Acupuncture works through these organ systems and meridians. Acupuncture is one of the more mysterious practices within the health industry today. Acupuncture is a key component of traditional Chinese medicine and supposedly dates back to around 100 BC. The mystery surrounding its origin mirrors the uncertainty that clouds its effectiveness in today's world. Advocates of the ancient practice Acupuncture is the science of healing with needles through energy channels; it has a rich history and is now used around the world. The real question is, is acupuncture effective? How can we simply prove that sticking needles into a person's body is actually taking away their "}
