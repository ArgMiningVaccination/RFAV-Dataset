Men C, PCV, Hib Suspension fluid - Fluid (water, saline, tissue-culture mixture) Preservatives, stabilisers, antimicrobial agents - Trace to stabilise vaccine- May cause allergic reactionwww.immunisation.ie Adjuvants - Aluminium salt used to increase immunogenicity of vaccines containing inactivated micro-organisms or their products e.g. Hepatitis B vaccine Tetanus toxoid Diphtheria toxoidVaccine componentswww.immunisation.ie Thiomersal* - Used in vaccine production since the 1930s - Mercury containing compound used in some vaccines to prevent bacterial and fungal growth - Also used as inactivating agent in early stage of production of some killed vaccines - In 1999 EU and U.S. manufacturer's decision to decrease thiomersal levels in vaccinesVaccine components *also known as thimerosalwww.immunisation.ieVaccine failure Primary - Inadequate immune response to vaccine (e.g.MMR1) - Infection possible any time post vaccination Secondary - Adequate antibody response immediately after vaccination - Level of antibodies decrease with time - Booster doses usually required- Feature of many inactivated vaccineswww.immunisation.ieTime intervals between vaccine doses Antigen combination Recommended minimal interval between doses 2 killed antigens No minimum interval Killed and live antigens No minimum interval2 live antigens Four-week minimum interval if not administered simultaneouslywww.immunisation.ieTime intervals between vaccine doses 2 Live vaccines - Minimum one month interval required - Allows each immune response to develop - Allows the next response to be a true secondary response - i.e. faster and bigger and with higher affinity IgG - Diminishes immune interferencewww.immunisation.ieVaccine overload The human body is composed of 10 trillion cells and contains 100 trillion bacteria On average there are 1000 bacteria on each cm2 of skin 1,000,000 bacteria on each cm2 of the scalp 100,000,000 bacteria per gram of saliva The maximum number of antigens in a vaccine was ~3000 (DTwP, most from wP) With the new vaccines this number is much lower still No evidence that vaccines can overload the immune system http://www.schoolscience.co.uk/con tent/4/biology/abpi/immune/immune3www.immunisation.ieAdverse events Live vaccines: - frequency of adverse events falls with number of doses - If antibody is made -> neutralises small amount of vaccine virus in any subsequent vaccine dose - E.g. MMR Inactivated vaccines - frequency of adverse events increases with number of doses - Good antibody levels ->good secondary immune response - May be inflammatory (i.e. produce a sore arm) - E.g. tetanus, pertussiswww.immunisation.ieHerd immunity Only applies to diseases which are passed from person to person For each disease - a certain level of immunity in the population which protects the whole population because the disease stops spreading in the community Provides indirect protection of unvaccinated as well as vaccinated individuals. May be the most important aspect of how vaccines work - MMR given to infants protects pregnant women from rubella. - Can eradicate disease even if some people remain susceptible http://www.immunisation.nhs.uk/A bout_Immunisation/Science/How_ immunisation_works_-_animationwww.immunisation.ieAcknowledgements Core Topic 2 Training slides, Health Protection Agency, UK , Feb 2008 www.hpa.org.uk/web/HPAweb File/HPAweb_C/1194947391135 Understanding vaccines, National Institutes of Health, US Jan 2008 www3.niaid.nih.gov/healthscience/ healthtopics/vaccine/PDF/undvacc. pdf "}
