However, victims of blast and penetrating trauma may require massive transfusions, and when multiple victims present at once, this may create challenges for local blood banks, including problems with unidentified patients (and the risk of transfusion reactions), the need to run multiple massive transfusion protocols at once, and the need to perform many crossmatches on numerous patients in a short period of time. More than 400 units of packed red blood cells were used after the Aurora (CO) movie theatre shooting. A similar number were used after the Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando, and 222 were given by a Las Vegas trauma center after the 2017 mass shooting. Hospitals should plan internally and with their external blood suppliers for these types of MCIs to ensure adequate supplies are available. In the aftermath of MCIs and natural disasters, people from affected communities and across the nation often feel the urge to \"do something\" to help. In many cases people rush to donate blood, which can add another challenge to incident management. Realistically, hospitals will almost always use blood that has already been donated to treat the patients affected by the incident. Fresh blood must be put through safety testing (24-48 hours), and can only be stored for several few weeks. In 2017, donors overwhelmed blood donation centers after the Las Vegas shooting; thousands of people also lined up to donate blood after the Pulse Nightclub shooting. Having enough product readily available at the site of transfusion (and tracking which patient receives which unit) presents another planning challenge. Early and frequent communication via the media regarding blood donation needs (or alternative needs such as water, toiletries, or device chargers) can help community members contribute to the overall response without overwhelming donation centers or hospitals. This Topic Collection includes links to guidance, lessons learned (from disasters, no-notice incidents, and specific to transfusions), plans, tools, and templates, general research, and research specific to the disaster blood supply chain.

Their goal was to determine if post-MCI blood requirements were predictable. A median of 38 units of packed red blood cells was used per incident, with an average of 55 casualties. However, victims of terrorist events that were severely injured required an average of 5.9 units of packed cells each. These findings may help with predicting blood product needs based on event type and the number of casualties.

They wrote, \"Preliminary results in approximately 500 patients with massive transfusion indicate that the amount of fresh warm whole blood transfused is independently associated with improved 48-hr and 30-day survival and the amount of stored red blood cells is independently associated with decreased 48-hr and 30-day survival for patients with traumatic injuries that require massive transfusion. Risks of warm fresh whole blood transfusion include the transmission of infectious agents and the potential for microchimerism.\" [Login](/login?returnurl=xpcRQVQedb57KCs/She7W5NciasdVBkCKloHmWB3/J5qV9oL1Mdg4fcD0U0aHLxqKQ0Bfo9EcftmFuG3aCXBDLtPQmYOC+dH0A3u9KKzJoY=) to rate, favorite, and comment on the article The authors reviewed data on 1,536 patients (92% received compatible plasma transfusions and 8% received incompatible type A plasma). There were no differences in morbidity or mortality between the two groups.

They found that \"the transfusion of an increased fibrinogen: RBC ratio was independently associated with improved survival to hospital discharge, primarily by decreasing death from hemorrhage.\" [Login](/login?returnurl=xpcRQVQedb57KCs/She7W5NciasdVBkCKloHmWB3/J5qV9oL1Mdg4fcD0U0aHLxqKQ0Bfo9EcftmFuG3aCXBDFJv8a7fQAfkUcIe+VRLp08=) to rate, favorite, and comment on the article Select Resources on Cost Considerations This interactive webpage provides answers to questions regarding coding and billing of blood products and transfusion services reimbursable under the Medicare program.

This presents an economic and supply-related challenge (e.g., seasonal shortages). The authors share how changing payment policies, improving emergency/surge capacity, and technological advances can help ensure a safe, sustainable blood supply.
