It is a sister science to yoga and meditation. It is also called the science of truth as it is expressed in life. Ayurveda gifts us with practices of diet, exercise and lifestyle based on our individual constitution. These practices shape our daily routine, diet, digestion, physical hygiene and mental hygiene. Based on the principle of balance, Ayurveda helps us return to homeostasis, wholeness and optimal functioning. By looking at the individual as a whole, Ayurveda provides tangible practices on a path to vitality and joy. As embodied beings, it is our birthright to life healthfully, mindfully and energetically in our bodies -- to enjoy this great journey of life that we are on.
