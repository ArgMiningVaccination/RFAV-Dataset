History worth reviewing: it was patients created the term \"long COVID\" (or \"long -haul COVID\"). Possibly the first disease to be defined via patients finding each other on social media.

The Newness of New Diseases \"In the 1960s and 1970s, most physicians were aware of the possibility of pandemics... However, the emergence of a truly new infectious disease that could dramatically affect society was still a purely hypothetical concept.
