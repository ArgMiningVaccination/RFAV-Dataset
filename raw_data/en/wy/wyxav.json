Nestled in the breathtaking Blue Ridge Mountains, while being held in the nurturing care of our award-winning hospitality team, you will discover true healing, rejuvenation and divine evolution while giving yourself the space to reflect, reconnect, and awaken to a greater sense of Self. Nurture The Journey To Your Source Reset In Your Personal Sanctuary AWAKEN Your Higher Self NOURISH All Your Senses Breathe Renewing Vitality SoHum The Oneness Of All SoHum, is the phonetic pronunciation of the sacred mantra So'Ham - a vibration that echoes within every breath we take, inviting us to rediscover inner peace and return to our true Self. So'Ham is an ancient Vedic mantra that has been revered for thousands of years for its transformative powers. The Sanskrit words translate to I am That and are a reminder of our innate connection to the universe and the pure essence within us that tethers us to all creation. This simple yet profound vibration ushers in peace, clarity and a deep sense of self-awareness when repeated with intention and devotion. On the inhale, mimicking the sound of the breath, we silently chant: Sooooo On the exhale, with the sound of releasing the breath, we silently chant: Hummmmm \"When sound, breath, and awareness come together, it becomes light... So Hum meditation leads to the union of the individual with the universal Cosmic Consciousness. You will go beyond thought, beyond time and space, beyond cause and effect. Limitations will vanish.\" ~ Vasant Lad, BAM&S, MASc Stay Connected Subscribe to join our community and receive the latest updates "}
