If CSs are assigned as MDMAAs : It is highly recommended that t his duty be filled by personnel from the ship 's rotational pool of TAD personnel. 1109 MANPOWER PLANNING General messes are expected to maintain the traditional fine quality of Navy food service with limited manpower resources . This requires an efficiently organized system that considers the following management of manpower resources : Evaluation of factors that have an impact on manpower use . Proper use of the Daily NAVSUP 1090 to assist in advance workload planning and in meal planning. Use of t echniques t hat improve work flow and performance (often referred to as \" work simplification \"). Scheduling work efficiently . By periodically using analysis techniques developed in the four areas listed above, the FSO should be able to improve manpower use. This basic management function of planning and controlling the total manpower efforts is the sole responsibility of top food service management. 1110 MANPOWER USE Table 1 -1 on the following page is a guide to use when shortages (below 90 percent of Ship's Manning Document (SMD ) levels) of CS personnel exist resulting in difficulties in maintaining the full level of patron and food service standards. The functions and tasks are arranged by staffing level in relationship to CS SMD levels ( that is, manned at 60 percent to 69 percent, 70 percent to 79 percent, and 80 percent to 89 percent) . Final actions taken to correct reduced manning levels will need to be developed according to a s hip's/station's specific circumstances and talent levels . Cross training of al l assigned personnel is highly recommended. This matrix presents alternatives only; it is not intended as a definitive answer to manning problems. It should be noted that reducing equipment and consolidating redundant jobs ( separate Damage Control Petty O fficers (DCPO s), Repair Parts Petty Officers (RPPO s), and administrative POs for S-2/S-5 divisions on large deck ships ) can help reduce manpower requirements. NAVSUP P- 486, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 1-20 Per cent Manned TASKS 80% to 89% 70% to 79% 60% to 69% Recommend elimination or reduction of labor intensive onboard production of breakfast pastries and other non- essential bakery products. X Recommend elimination of Wardroom/CPO mess food production (subsist from GM ). Detail Culinary Specialist personnel to GM. X Recommend elimination or reduction of special events that require additional meal preparation and service. X Recommend removal or reduction of the number of Culinary Specialists assigned to non- food production duties (general shipboard duties/watch bills) in port and underway . X Recommend exclusion or reduction of the number of non -rated Culinary Specialists a ssigned to food service attendant duties. X Recommend elimination or limiting breakfast eggs to order. X Recommend offering only one meat entr\u00e9e. X Recommend closing or limiting variety on the Speed line . X Table 1- 1 Culinary Specialist Personnel Shortages Guide 1111 MANP OWER EVALUATION CSs and FSAs must know what is expected of them in terms of manning levels . Production objectives and work tasks must be developed for all levels and translated into daily plans. Management control must be established to ensure that all available man- year-hours are used to the best possible advantage. There ar e many time -loss factors inherent in any food service operation. Examples of time -loss factors include sick call, per sonnel injuries , required breaks , physical fitness considerations , unauthorized absences, watch- stations, and shipboard training. Time loss from these factors may be of less consequence than time wasted from improper management planning. The following factors that are attributable to a lack of management planning may cause lost personnel hours : Failure to follow recipe cards. Improper requisitioning and inadequate production planning. Inefficient production techniques. Unplanned/non-communicated delivery support. Shortage of equipment and/or utensils. Lack of instructions. Overstaffing in one functional area while understaffing in another. Use of spaces that are not actually required (f or instance, securing Wardroom and CPO Mess on weekends). 1112 CLOT HING FOR PERSONNEL 1.GENERAL. Basic mandatory requirements for food service clothing include cleanliness and sanitation. It is not the responsibility of an individual to purchase organizational clothing whenNAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 1-21serving as galley staff.

The materials are readily available and ships have t he authority to customize colors, styles, and logos representative o f their C ommand. 1113 A CCOUNTABILITY 1.GENERAL. The degrees of accountability to the United States cannot be set forth in detail because of the many fine distinctions contained in rulings of the courts, in opinions of theAttorney General, in decisions of the Comptroller General, and in other rulings, decisions, and directives . A final conclusion on any question of accountability generally depends on the facts involved in that particular case; any specific rule expressed in a particular case , although of general interest, may not be suitable for general application. The definitions in a, b, and c below describe the accountability relationships involved in handling stock and monies. a.Accountable Officer. The term \"accountable officer\" is construed to mean a Commissioned Officer detailed to duty involving financial responsibility for public funds and property in the Officer's custody. b.Accountable Officer Submitting Returns. For the personal accountability of subsistence returns, the term \"accountability\" is defined as the obligation to render an accounting of property and funds for which an individual is responsible. This individual is charged by law, lawful order, or regulation with the responsibility for keeping accurate records ofpublic funds or property and assumes a public trust that such funds or property will be used for purposes authorized by law or regulations. The property or funds may or may not be in the physical possession of the accountable officer.NAVSUP P- 486, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 1-22c.Accountable Person Not Submitting Returns. An accountable person not submitting returns is a person who, in the performance of the primary duties of their official position, designation, or assignment, and within the limits of the authority vested in them, is required to provide receipt for and to assume jurisdiction and continuous security over public funds or public property that may come into this person's physical possession because of the person's position, designation, or assignment. In addition, the accountable person is required to exercise immediate personal supervision of the stowage, the storage spaces, the maintenance of required records, and the proper disposition of the funds or property. 2.AC COUNTABLE POSITIONS. Under the above definitions accountable positions in the GM are those of the FSO , the B ulk Storeroom Custodian, the Cashiers , and any Cash C ollection Agents. 3.ABSENC E OF AN ACCOUNTABLE PERSON. When necessary , the CO or SUPPO (if designated by the CO) may permit that the duties of an accountable person be performed by another qualified individual , with the consent of that person . This situation may occur when a member accountable for public property or funds representing sales or meals sold from the GM becomes physically incapacitated or begins a period of authorized absence such as leave or temporary additional duty. 4.FI NANCIAL IMPROVEMENT AUDIT READINESS POLICY. A financial audit is an independent evaluation of whether an organization's financial statements are fairly presented i n accordance with appropriate accounting standards. Audit readiness is a state of being prepared at all times to demonstrate proper manual and automated processes and documentation ( such as process controls, financial controls, and Information Technology (IT) controls) that are executed in accordance with policy and appropriate accounting standards. The Department of the Navy (DO N) has moved toward audit readiness. The adequacy and availability of supporting documents will be critical to a successful financial audit. Enforcement of food service accountability must be adhered to. In accordance with the memorandum dated 2 5 January 2015 from the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Financial Operations), the D ON must retain all documentation in support of a financial statement audit for 10 years . This includes all SIK records such as food purchase requests, food receipts from vendors, STORES, 1149s, and any other relevant transaction history data. The D ON maintains a constant state of audit readiness by having business processes that are sustainable, traceable, and repeatable. FIAR is congressionally mandated. 5.AS SERTION IN AUDIT OR AUDITING. Assertion in audit or auditing means that which Management Claims: It is the responsibility of the entity's management to prepare financial statements in which all the assets, liabilities, incomes, expenses , and other financial data are recognized, measured, presented , and disclosed in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework . In other words , it is the responsibility of management to prepare financial statements that giv e a true and fair view of the business. 6.CO MMITMENT AND/ OR OBLIGATION. These are financial transactions that require future payment. FSOs, as the Departmental Accountable Officials, are financially accountable for obligations they create. 7.EX PENDITURE. These are the funds that are spent when a payment is made. 8.UNM ATCHED DISBURSEMENT. This is a disbursement transaction that has been received and accepted by an accounting office but has not been matched to the correct detail obligation.NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 1-23This includes transactions that have been rejected and sent back to the paying office or central disbursement clearing organization by an accounting office. Some examples are incorrect LOAs, invalid DODAACs, incorrect requisition numbers, cancelled orders , and incorrect STORES profiles. 9.CONT ROL ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION . Information on control activity is provided below. a.Key Control Objective (KCO) - This is an objective that an auditor will examine and look for in the course of an audit. An e xample is check ing to ensure that all obligations f rom FSM are recorded in the Standard A ccounting and Reporting System (STARS -FL). (1)SIK3: Obligation Recording - Before the release of an order, the Food Service Officer or the person designated via Commanding Office's letter of authority, reviews SIK requirements for time, purpose, and amounts evidenced by the signature, legiblyprinted name, and date on a printout of the FSM requisition file. The person signing must have a letter of authority from the Commanding Officer (see Appendix D, page D-14). The hard copy printout must be physically or electronically (scanned) retained.

(3)SIK 8: Price and Catalog Change - This is the w eekly catalog update processing into FSM. The Catalog Update Change file from STORES is uploaded to FSM Central Enterprise Database to ensure that the best available prices are resident in the Business Logistics Applications (BLA). Retention of the FSM catalog uploadsscreenshots. b.Key Supporting Document (KSD) - This is supporting documentation on a process or system operation. For e xample, describing how obligations associated with SIK requisitions are created and passed to the accounting system.(1)KSD SIK3 : FSM orders - an FSM requisition file is required. For manual orders, a manually generated MILSTRIP order (email/message) , signed TYCOM memo authorizing food orders generated outside FSM . (2)KSD SIK 4: Receipts - Physical hard- copy includes Commercial vendor receipts, DD Form 1149s, DD Form 1348s, and administrative receipt s. 1114 FINA NCIAL LOSSE S AND ACCOUNTABILITY 1.GENERAL. The member designated as the FSO becomes financially accountable for funds collected from sales of meals and food items and for subsistence stocks supporting general mess operations. As the accountable officer, the FSO is required to reimburse the Government for all losses of property or funds resulting from theft, loss of cash , and uncollected payments for credit sales of meals. If circumstances warrant, the FSO may request relief from financial accountability using the guidelines specified in DoD 7000.14R, Financial Management Regulation Vol 5, Chapter 6, Section 0606 that defines \"loss or excess of government funds or pr operty\" as those losses of $750.00 or more or any physical loss where there is evidence of fraud within the accounting function. Reviewing authorities should consider conducting a preliminary inquiry when recurring losses or excesses indicate carelessness in handling public funds or property and when regular management reviews and reports are not considered adequate to remedy this situation. A loss not directly caused by theft, fraud, or willful misconduct (adjustments due to errors in r ecords , issue s, or posting) of less than two percent will not require a Judge Advocate General ( JAG) Investigation. 1 -24NAVSU P P-486, Rev 9 - Food Servi ce Management When discrepancies result in a loss or gain by adjustment in excess of two percent of the total subsistence inventory dollar value, the Commanding Officer/CNIC (Ashore) must be notified by the SUPPO/FSO/Regional Galley Program Managers (Ashore OCONUS). The CO/CNIC must review and, if required , shall assign an audit and/or investigating panel of two or more Boa rd Members (E7-a bove) outs ide the Supply Department to determine if a JAG Investigation is warranted. Refer to NAVSUP P-486, Para 7101, I nventory Management. 2.CASH SALE LOSSES. Cash sale losses are discussed below. a.Losses of $10.00 or Less. Losses from cumulative cash differences during any single month amounting to $10.00 or less will be reported on the \"Other Sales of Meals\" line of the General Mess Summary Document (NAVSUP Form 1359) in accordance with paragraph 7002-3. No further action is required. b.Losses of More Than $10.0 0 and Less Than $750.00. This situation requires NAVSUP N432 approval to use the \"Other Sales of Meals\" line on the General Mess Summary Document (NAVSUP Form 1359). A JAG investigation is not necessary for cash overages or for any shortage caused by unforeseen circumstances such as counterfeit bills or electronic payment disconnections. 3.REQUESTS FOR RELIEF OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR LOSSES OF MORE THAN $750.00. A letter requesting relief from financial accountability must be submitted by the FSO via the Chain of Command (with an endorsement from TYCOM/CNIC) for any loss with the exception of legitimate inventory adjustments (cash sales/subsistence inventory) of more than$7 50.00. This must be done regardless of whether the loss is identified as theft, e mbezzlement, fraud, fault, or negligence of the accountable officer. The request l etter s hall be forwarded to the Support Services Directorate, Food Service Division (NAVSUP N432 ). For los ses of more than $750.00, a JAG or NISO investigation must be conducted to determine whether the loss was caused by theft, embezzlement, fraud, or fault/negligence of the accountable officer. Copies of all investigations must be forwarded with the CO's endorsement. See Appendix D- 16 for a sample letter . The CO's endorsement must include, at a minimum, the following items: Specific duty assignment of the individual requesting relief at the time of loss . Experience, or lack thereof, of the individual . Information detailing when, how, and by whom the loss was discovered. Actions taken to verify loss and to determine how the loss occurred . When the last cash count was made and balanced before discovery of the shortage. The p revailing circumstances (such as any special physical conditi ons) at the time of the loss. Details on security, storage conditions, and any regulations that established and/or enforced . Procedures that were in use to reduce the possibility of losses or shortages of cash . A statement that pertinent regulations and instructions were or were not followed . Any p ast involvement of the individual in any other losses . A statement about whether or not theft or criminal actions were deemed to be involved. The m anner in which the loss currently is being carried in activity records An opinion as to whether or not the loss or deficiency was caused by the Individual's fault or negligence. 1115 LETTERS OF AUTHORIT Y AND APPOINTMENT Letters of authority designate personnel to act on behalf of another person or persons of higher authority. Letters of authority permit certain functions or actions, while letters of appointment assign responsibility and authority to designated personnel to administer a specific function. It NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 1-25may be required to have more than one person authorized to perform the same function; in those cases it is permitted to address multiple persons on a single letter. The FSO is required to maintain a current file of all such letters pertinent to the operations of the food service operation. See Appendix D for sample templates of such letters . 1116 F OOD SERVICE EVALUAT ION, TRAINING , AND ASSESSMENT CHECKLIST 1.GENERAL. NAVSUP P- 486 contains the minimum standards and requirements for all GMs unless otherwise directed by the Type Commander, major claimant, CO, or FSO . General messes should review Type Commander and/or major claimant instructions governing any rules or regulations over and above those outlined in this manual. 2.EVALU ATIONS, ASSISTANCE TRAINING, AND ASSESSMENTS. Various methods are used in maintaining and improving the quality of food service operations for GMs. The se methods include Navy Food Management Team assist ance visits , Supply Management Certification , Supply Managem ent Inspection, and Ney Memorial Awards Evaluations. Supply Management Certifications and Supply Management Inspection checklists are written and enforced at the TYCOM level. A consolidated, standardized checklist is provided as Appendix I and will be used for all training visits and assessments done by Navy Food Management Teams and Ney Evaluators. This is a recommended and useful tool for all internal food service self - assessments. Thi s checklist details all the minimum standard requirements outlined throughout NAVSUP P- 486. Each activity must review the TYCOM/ Major Claimant instructions that provide additional or increased standards to those outlined in the checklist. 3.USE. Appendix I was developed to encompass all situations regardless of how a GM operates . To determine grade, divide the total points assigned by the applicable total points . 1117 T HE BOARD OF INSPECTION AND SURVEY The Board of Inspection and Survey (INSURV) is an inspection that a ship participates in approximately every 3 to 5 years from the time the ship is commissioned. TYCOMs work closely with INSURV teams and should be used to identify potential issues with various afloat platforms. To reach the INSURV inspection portal click on the below website link and click on the resources tab and then click on the Web Master link to send an email to the INSURV Web Master requesting access : https://www.public.navy.mil/fltfor/insurv/Pages/Inspection_Resources.aspx The request will be sent to the tenant/sponsor, via the UIC supplied, for approval. N avy 311 should be contacted for assistance at 1- 855-NAVY311 if there are issues with account approval or SAAR s ubmissions. 1118 ASHORE ACCRE DITATION An a shore GM must complete an annual ashore accreditation review to ensure that they are providing quality and nutritious meals with great service to their customers and to ensure that all applicable policy is being followed. GMs will conduct a self -assessment before a validation review from CNIC. This process is used to determine nomination for participation in the annual Captain Edward F. Ney memorial awards competition. The a ccredit ation checklist must be standardized throughout the enterprise and will be provided by CNIC. NAVSUP P- 486, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 1-26PART C: FOOD SERVICE SPACES AND SECURITY 1200 STOREROOMS AND COMPARTMENTS 1.GENERAL. Food service spaces include accountable and non-a ccountable areas. Storerooms contain food items that are desirable, easily pilfered, and easily converted to personal use. The galley and other food production areas contain equipment that can be dangerous or damaged if improperly used; therefore, all food service spaces (e xcept for common access areas such as the mess deck and passageways) sha ll be locked when not attended, and only authorized personnel should be allowed in those spaces. All food service spaces will be identified to indicate functions, contents, the person responsible for the space, and the personnel to be contacted in cas e of an emergency. Use the standar d Navy placard (NSN 0118- LF-020-3200). Ashore may use locally prepared placard provided all information is stated. 2.ACCOUNTABLE SPACES GROUP II. All bulk subsistence storerooms, including refrigerated storerooms for keeping food chilled and frozen, are accountable spaces. Any subsistenc e issue rooms in use also are accountable spaces. All subsistence in these spaces is in the custody of the Bu lk Storeroom Cu stodian who is responsible to the accountable FSO for its safekeeping. Storage spaces will be maintained in a neat and orderly fashion. Food items shall be stored in accordanc e with applicable regulations and as outlined in Appendix F of this manual and Tri Service Food Code. Temperatures of bulk refrigerated spaces will be taken from thermometers inside the spaces at least twice daily and shall be recorded on the back of NAVSUP Food Preparation Worksheet 1090 or in a separate temperature logbook. The engineering department is required to maintain a separate log with temperatures taken from remote sensors. Temperatures exceeding authorized ranges will be immediately reported to the FSO. Access to these spaces will be strictly controlled by the FSO. Ice build-u p can cause increased temperatures; therefore, ice shall not be allowed to accumulate more than one-q uarter of an inch on interior surfaces and on coils inside all bulk refrigerated spaces. 3.NON-A CCOUNTABLE SPACES. Access to all food preparation and holding spaces and to the scullery should be restricted to prevent injury to personnel, damage to equipment, or contamination of food and mess gear. Common use areas should normally be secured only long enough to complete cleaning and during periods of setting up for, and s ecuring after, meals. 1201 SECURI TY OF FOO D SERVICE SPACES 1.GENERAL. The following general security rules apply to food service spaces: Accountable food items always will be kept under lock and key. Responsibility for the security of spaces lies with the individual in charge of each space. Food service spaces will be kept locked when not attended by authorized personnel. Subsistence storerooms must always be locked in the absence of the storeroom custodian. Permission for persons not authorized to have access will be obtained from the SUPPO , the FSO, or a delegated assistant. Keys to food service spaces will not be taken from the area of the ship or shore activity. In accordance with NAVSUP P -486 Para 1202 , a key log will be maintained to identify the holders of keys removed from the lockable key box in the food service office. All padlocks will be of a key type because combination locks present a greater security risk. The key locks will contain dead bolts with pin tumblers and will be made either of brass or bronze. The recommended type of padlock can be obtained from the Af loat Shopping Guide, Federal Class 5340 . Offices are to be kept locked when not open for business. Distribution of office keys will be at the discretion of the SUPPO/ FSO.NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 1-27Local procedures will be established to govern issuance of keys to accountable space s after normal working hours. 2.LOCK GROUPINGS AFLOAT. Aboard ship the locks of the food service division will be int egrated with those of the rest of the supply department. Locks and keys for individual spaces are grouped by the following functional areas: a. Group I. All supply department spaces and general stores spaces including storerooms, special lockers, and other related spaces. b. Group II. All food service spaces including the galley, bake shop, bread room, vegetable preparation area, food service is sue room, meat preparation area, refrigerated spaces, and food service storerooms. c.Group III and Group IV. Group III spaces consist of the ship' s retail and clothing stores, the fountain, vending machines, and related bulk storerooms. Group IV spaces consist of the ship's service activities such as the barber shop, tailor shop, dry cleaning shop, andlaundry. Eac h lock shall be opened by an original key and a duplicate key that shall be different from the keys to any other space. E ach group must have a master key and one duplicate master key capable of opening every lock in the group. There also must be a grand master key and one duplicate grand master key capable of opening every lock in every group. Note: Group III spaces have special keyless padlock s that are except ions. 3.LO CKS ASHORE. The locks of ashore GM food service divisions may or may not be integrated with other locks of the supply department. In either case, the FSO must be aware of the existence of , and the controls over , any master key and duplicate master keys that can open food service spaces. A key log shall be maintained to identify the holders of keys removed from alockable key box. 4.IN ADEQUATE STORAGE SPACE AFLOAT . Accountable food items always must be kept under lock and key except afloat when the bulk of such material required for a mandatedendurance load makes stowage under lock and key impractical. Stowage of accountable foodoutside of locked and controlled storerooms must not be done without t he knowledge and concurrence of the SUPPO and/or FSO. For small platforms such as submarines, the CO must approve of all food stored outside of lockable storage locations with the understanding that the FSO is still accountable for the food. Ph ysical ina bility to store all items under lock and key may mitigate, but does not relieve, the FSO of responsibility for accountability. Local procedures must be put in place to safeguard and maintain accountability of food items not under lock and key. Each ship must develop a plan based on the ship's stowage situation and the best method of maintaining an accurate inventory. 1202 CUS TODY AND HANDLING OF KEYS (AFLOAT ) 1.KEYS TO FOOD SERVICE SPACES. No two spaces will have locks that can be opened wi th the same original and duplicate key except by the master key and grand master key. The person in charge of the space will get the original key from the general key locker at the beginning of the day. This person will keep possession of the original key during working hours.At the end of the working day the original key will be placed in the general key locker. The general key locker, located in the supply office, provides centralized key control. The key s to the galley , bake shop, bread room, and vegetable preparation room may pass between Watch Captains as they relieve each other; but these keys may not leave the ship or activity. Keys for accountable storerooms, chill boxes, and reefers will be turned in to the NAVSUP P- 486, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 1-28general key locker at the end of each working day. The FSO must ensure that there is adequate control of the key locker and keys for all food service spaces. Duplic ate keys must be kept in a duplicate key locker in the supply office or in the SUPP O's safe. The S UPPO may authorize the FSO to maintain a special duplicate key locker when procedures require recurring use of duplicate keys. 2.SPE CIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. If the above procedures do not satisfy local circumstances, the S UPPO may prescribe in writing alternate procedures to ensure proper control of keys and access to spaces. 3.MASTER AND GRAND MASTER KEYS. The SUPPO will maintain custody of a grand master key to all supply department spaces. The SUPPO may authorize the use of a duplicate grand master key as a turnover item among duty SUPPO s. Using a duplicate grand master key requires providing strict accountability for possession of the key between duty SUPPO s. The master key, which will open all locks in Group II but must be different from the master key to Groups I and IV, also will be in the custody of the SUPPO . A duplicate Group II master key may be placed in the custody of an officer (usually the FSO ) or LC S designated in writing by the SUPPO . 4.EQU IPMENT AND LOCKER KEYS. The keys to cabinets and small non- accountable gear storage lockers located in the common messing areas will be controlled as directed by the FSO . These areas o ften are under the responsibility of the Mess Deck Master -at-Arms and may use a separate padlock series set or non -series locks. 1203 AC COUNTABILITY AND RIGHT OF ACCESS As department head, the SUPPO (afloat) has overall accountability and right of access to all food service spaces. As division officer, the FSO also has overall accountability and right of access to all food service spaces. T his right of access must n ot compromise accountability. 1204 MAINTENANCE O F FOOD SERVICE EQUIPME NT 1.GENERAL. The optimum situation is to have dedicated engineering personnel permanently assigned to the supply department to keep food service equipment at the highest efficiency.However, when dedi cated personnel cannot fix or repair equipment services may be obtained from a commercial company. The activity's operations and maintenance allotment or the ship's operating target funds will pay for the parts supplied and repair service from a commercial company. Only company -qualified maintenance personnel will make repairs. It is the responsibility of the FSO and the LCS to know the Preventive Maintenance System requirements for food service equipment and to monitor timely performance of Preventive M aintenance System checks by government or commercial personnel. Ashore and afloat guidance is provided below. a.Ashore. An evaluation of which method provides the best service for the cost must be made when the option is available to choose between repairs made by Public Works or commercial contractor. b.Afloat. Use dedicated engineering department personnel who are capable of performing repairs and who are properly trained to perform maintenance on all galley equipment . Prime Vendor equipment must be serviced by commercial companies when in homeport. Before deployment, a repair kit must be acquired from vendors to ensure an adequate supply of spare parts (known failures) in the C urrent Ships Maintenance Project (CSMP) using Organization Maintenance M anagement Systems -- Next Generation (OMMS- NG).Eight o'clock reports and trouble call logs should be used for the ship's records and to assist in placing requisitions through Supply for repair parts or for equipmentNAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 1-29replacement s. These records also can be used for tracking all equipment repairs and supporting a equipment phased replacement program . Only Food Service Equipment authorized by NAVSEA/NAVSUP can be installed onboard Afloat Units. 2.IN SPECTION. Personnel who operate food service equipment will conduct a thorough cleanliness and material inspection each morning. The material inspection should include the locat ion of loose nuts, bolts, parts, connections, and similar problems before starting equipment operation. Inspections on afloat units are very important because c ontinuous ship vibrations may affect machinery. Equipment on afloat units must be thoroughly inspected after each use. Every effort must be made to maintain the appearance and general working condition of all facilities and e quipment in the GM . 3.SA FETY OF EQUIPMENT. No food service equipment will be modified from the original manufacturer specifications under any circumstances. Food service equipment will be operated in accordance with the manufacturer's technical specifications. 4.SUBSI STENCE PRIME VENDOR SUPPORT. The Subsistence Prime Vendor under the Defense Logistics Agency -- Troop Support is responsible for maintaining the equipment that they own and provide to the Navy. A dequate spare parts, repair kits , and maintenance instructions must be available for equipment owned and maintained by a Subsistence Prime Vendor. Endurance load levels of spare parts for Prime Vendor equipment must be acquired before deploying.NAVSUP P- 486, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 1-30PART D: FOOD SER VICE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 1300 FO OD SERVICE MANAGEM ENT The FSM system is a multi -user, web-based automation system for afloat and ashore GMs that have been certified by the Naval Supply Systems Command through the Navy Authorization to Operate (ATO) and/or Type Accreditation. NAVSUP Business Systems Center (NAVSUPBSC ) developed the system and provides technical and project management support. The FSM ashore platform resides with NAVS UP; the FSM afloat web application is deployed on the shipboard IT -21 server or on the shipboard Navy Information Application Product Suite (NIAPS) server or on the Consolidated Afloa t Enterprise System (CANES) .

Th e ration credit shall be recorded on the monthly NAVSUP Form 1359 under Ration Break down (Figure 2-2 ). b.Persons Unable to Pay. Pe rsons unable to pay must sign NAVSUP Form 1291, Meal Signature Record (Figure 2-3 ). NAVSUP FORM 1291 should be annotated at the top of the form with \"Disaster/Emergency/Humanitarian Feeding.\" Meal Pass Number and Command/Unit columns should be left blank. Re cord ration credit in the Food Service Management System (FSM) under the appropriate c ategory within the RIK headc ount section function. When large numbers of personnel are involved, use NAVSUP Form 1292 Recapitulation of Meal Record, (Figure 2-4 ) to record mass feeding (See sample on Figure 2-2 0). The FSO should contact the local disas ter coordinator to determine if reimbursement can be obtained from any of the following: Federal Emergency Management Agency The American Red Cross Navy Relief A business (c ontractor responsible for causing an evacuation) Other disaster relief organizations c.When Payment Cannot be Collected. FSOs unable to collec t payment for meals must forward a Certification of Rations Issued Form (Figures 2-1a , 2-1 b, and 2-1 c), in accordance with Pa ragraph 2003 below, to NAVSUP N432 with the monthly NAVSUP Form 1359 to document the disaster/emergency/humanitarian feeding. d.Accounting for Reimbursement. FSOs receiving reimbursement after the close of the accounting period for meals that were rec orded as Emergency rations shall make deposits using DD FORM 1131 and citing the SIK LOA. This must not be recorded in FSM because there is no cash sales associated with it. A c opy of DD FORM 1131 shall be forwarded to NAVSUP N432. All sale of meals occurring in the same fiscal year mus t be depos ited before the end of that fiscal year. 3.GUIDELINES FOR THE FSO TO INITIATE TRANSFER OF SUBSISTENCE. The steps for initiating transfer of subsistenc e are disc ussed below. a.Identify. Identify all food items to be transferred and document them as an emergency breakout on NAVSUP Form 1282. At the top of NAVSUP Form 1282, identify the unique disaster/emergency /humanitarian situation and include the Co mmand and country for afloat units outside of the United States. NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 2-6b.Break Down Rations. Break down rations for the transfer of subsistence. c.Convert . Convert the dollar value of the transfer into ration credit: divide the total value of transferred subsistence by the current Basic Daily Food Allowance (BDFA) and add the applicable allowances for the day of issue . Example: $500.00 worth of supplies divided by $9.84 plus $2.00 Prime Vendor (PV) allowance) equals 50.8 rations (round to 51) . NOTE that the PV allowance is used as the applicable allowance for the day of issue. d. Record. Record the total rations for disaster/emergency/humanitarian feeding in the appropriate category in the ration breakdown section of NAVSUP Form 1359. This ration value must agree with and be supported by a Certification of Rations Form forwarded toNAVSUP N432 with the monthly NAVSUP Form 1359. Ration credit shall be taken daily for all meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) that equal rations converted from the dollarvalue. e. f.Annotate. Annotate any additional headcounts that ex ceed the allowed amount at the top of NAVSUP Form 1090. 4.MARI TIME INTERDICTION OPERATIONS . Maritime Interdiction Operations ( MIOs ) are naval-conducted operations that aim to delay, disrupt, or destroy enemy forces or supplies en route to the battle area; they are similar to Air Interdiction Operations . When boarding operations are conducted, the GM may be required to provide food items for health reasons as part of complying with international codes and policies . Under MIO, t he CO must authorize, in writing to the FSO, the transfer of food items to another ship. 5.GUI DELINES FOR THE FSO TO INITIATE TRANSFER OF SUBSISTENCE DURING MARITIME INTERDICTION OPERATIONS.

When field messes are operating in support of maneuvers, war games, field exercises, or similar operations where the galley is the only reasonable source of government subsistence with no other eating establishments within a reasonable distance, ration credit shall be taken for all enlisted members entitled to RIK and all enlisted members on Temporary Field Assignment (TFA) or Essential Unit Messing (EUM) status who are receiving BAS with a deduction from pay for meals served under field conditions. All members (including officers) on duty under circumstances where EUM has been declared will be charged for all meals made available whether eaten or not . Ration credit shall be taken for all rations sold as cash in accordance with P aragraph 2201. EUM is declared when members travel together with limited or no per diem . An appropriate authority is essential for operational readiness, military operations, or effective training where members are required to use a government mess or meals provided on behalf of the government . Me mbers must be in a travel status and are entitled to travel reimbursement for incidental expenses but not for subsistence . Designation for EUM will apply only to organizational units and to operational elements and detachments and will not apply to indivi dual service members . All members on duty under circumstances where EUM has been declared will be charged for all meals made available whether eaten or not except for approved missed meals . (Ref: DoD 7000.14- R Financial Management Regulation Volume 7A, Chapter 25). Field D uty consists of any maneuvers, war games, field exercises, or similar operations where a member is assigned to an organization drawing field rations or to a unit being subsisted in a dining facility operated by, or on behalf of , the U. S. Government . Members may be on per diem orders . All members on field duty will be charged for all meals made available whether eaten or not, subject to approved missed meals . (Ref: DoD 7000.14 -R Financial Management Regulation Volume 7A, Chapter 25 and OPNAVINST 7220.13 A). Each day , the total number of meals that were sold for cash, as recorded on DD Form 1544 will be added and recorded in C olumns (2) through (6) of NAVSUP Form 338 as shown below : Data Block I nstruction for Entry and Caption (1) Day of Mo.

Other Ration Credit Conversion Factors can be found in the current NAVSUPNOTE 7330. NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 2-442.STANDARD CONDITIONS . Ration credit determination is based on the number of signatures from enlisted m embers entitled to RIK recorded on the Meal Signature Record (NAVSUP Form 1291) and the number of rations sold as cash in accordance with Paragraph 2201. GMs operating the REVS automated system will determine ration credit by the total number of patrons w hose CAC was scanned for proper entitlement . The R K will manually enter headcounts in FSM. 2301 ASHO RE GENERAL MESSES The following activities are considered GMs ashore: Ashore activities except naval hospitals operating a hospital mess Mobile construction battalions operating GMs ashore Fleet and force commands operating GMs ashore Cargo handling battalions operating in GMs ashore Inactive service craft facilities Naval beach groups GMs operated aboard permanently moored ships that grant liberty . Examples include shore commands including naval inactive ship maintenance facilities . 2302 MEAL PASS AND THE REVS 1. GENERAL. The meal pass (NAVSUP Form 1105) is no longer required for use with a CAC system. The diner's CAC must be used to determine diner identity and the meal entitlement status properly. The GM duty cashier will be responsible for handling and sc anning the diner's CAC through the REVS automated system. Galley s not having REVS will continue to use DoD ID number. NOTE: The REVS database reflects the diner's mos t current pay record status as defined by DFAS. Because of this, there should be no confusion about a diner's meal entitlement status (RIK or cash). Leave and Travel, Orders, TAD Orders, and Permanent Change of Station (PCS) O rders a re discussed below. a.Responsibility of Diner's Parent PSD. It is the responsibility of the diner's parent PSDto key in changes to the member's pay entitlement records where situations of Leave and Travel orders, TAD orders , and PCS o rders are concerned . Changes in entitlements will be reflected in the DFAS database the REVS program accesses. b.Enlisted Personnel on Travel Orders. Enlisted personnel under official travel ordersthat indicate the individual is entitled to Subsistence- In-Kind will be allowed access to the GM at no charge. The travel order number and issuing command shall be recorded in the meal signature record and shall be annotated in the original travel ordersindicating the ex act meals provided at no cost. c.Individuals Who Are TAD. Individuals who are TAD from other commands and desire a meal must provide either a copy of their orders or a current NAVSUP 1105 Meal Pass . TAD personnel must sign the Meal Signature Sheet (NAVSUP Form 1291) . The meal pass number must be annotated on NAVSUP Form 1291. d.TAD Personnel Without RIK Entitlement. TAD personnel who cannot establish RIK entitlement will be treated as cash patrons . A receipt will be provided for the purpose of reimbursement. 2.RATIONS ALLOWED ASHORE . Two types of r ations are allowed ashore: those for enlisted personnel entitled to SIK and those for personnel authorized to use the GM on a cash payment basis .NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 2-45a.RIK Personnel. The FSO shall include, as allowed, Navy Regular rations (th ose rations that are provided to all Navy RIK). The supporting PERSUPPDET or, if there is no supporting PERSUPPDET, the Command Executive or Personnel Officer shall furnish the required rations allowed information for RIK personnel. The process is discussed below. (1)At the beginning of the month, the FSO or the Executive Officer/Personnel Officer shall obtain a list of all personnel on RIK and shall estimate the daily number of R IK personnel entitled to be fed. The FSO must be advised of any known circumstances such as training exercises, reservists training, large visiting groups, or change in BAS policy that might substantially affect the number of anticipated rations to be fed during the month. (2)At the end of the month the FSO will obtain from the PERSUPPDET (or from the Executive Officer and/or Personnel Officer) the total number of RIK rations allowed for the period. This number is the potential number of rations that are allowed to be fed at government expense. It is equal to the number of man-da ys that enlisted personnel are entitled to government rations during any given period. This excludes days when personnel who generally are entitled to RIK were receiving a BAS because of leave, travel, or hospitalization; it excludes days when generally entitled personnel were on unauthorized absence. This report must be made for each of two categories: Navy R egular and Other Personnel. The Other Personnel category includes all personnel entitled to be furnished RIK who are not regular Navy enlisted (such as other service regular, reserve, or guard; midshipmen or cadets; Coast Guard; foreig n military; and Navy reservists). b.Cash Sales. The FSO shall include rations s old for cash as allowed rations under the Other Personnel category. Certifications must be prepared as required and must be completed and signed before the departure of the affected personnel. 2303 SIG NATURE HEAD COUNT RSONNEL 1.GENERAL . CONUS the REVS automated system . Each member's CAC will be scanned through the system to properly identify the card holder and the meal entitlement . Facilities not currently on the automated system shall use the Meal Signature Records (NAVSUP Form 1291) for RIK personnel . Each person receiving a meal must sign the Form and annotate the 1291 with the DoD ID card number . Cash patrons must sign a prepared DD Form 1544 as shown in Para graph 2201. NOTE : Audit boards must use the resulting headcount numbers to verify ration credits claimed on NAVSUP Form 1292 and NAVSUP Form 338. 2.MEAL SIGNATURE RECORD (NAVSUP FORM 1291) PREPARATION . Preparati on of the meal signature record is discussed below. a.Heading Section . The heading of the NAVSUP Form 1291 shall be completed as follows before each meal: Data Block and Caption Instr uction for Entry Date Enter cur rent date. Sheet No. Enter the sheet number consecutively starting with number 0001. Ensuring that each sheet is numbered and dated before each meal allows control and prevents loss or misuse of the signature sheet. Categories of Personnel Personnel in each categor y are required to sign separate forms . This determines the actual number of personnel fed for each category of personnel . Place forms on separate clipboards for each category . The different NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 2-46categories will be indicated by using stenciled signs or color coding to match meal pass colors. b.Sig nature Section . A Master -at-Arms or other person authorized in writing by the FSO (see Appendix D for sample letter) will supervise the signing of the NAVSUP Form 1291 sheets ( Figure 2 -16). This individual , positioned behind the signature counter, will verify meal passes and direct personnel to the correct signature sheet . The Master -at-Arms shall determine the eligibility of personnel passing through the serving line to eat in the GM and shall require each person to show a valid meal pass and military identification card (this procedure will ensure that only persons who are entitled to RIK will eat meals at government expense) . Signatures and meal pass numbers must be legible . The signature section of NAVSUP Form 1291 will be filled out as shown below : Data Block and Caption In struction for Entry Sig nature Individuals legibly sign their last name. Meal Pass Number Individuals legibly enter their meal pass number or, when there is an REVS System , the DOD ID number from the individual's CAC will be added when scanned. Command/Unit Command or unit entries are not required by parent activity or host command personnel . Tenant activity personnel do not have to enter command or unit entries if the host command knows how to differentiate the tenant activity personnel from the meal pass members . Transient personnel must annotate NAVSUP Form 1291 with their command/unit. Imm ediately after securing the serving line, the Master -at-Arms shall assemble all NAVSUP Form s 1291 in sequence by category of personnel fed. The Master -at-Arms shall draw an ink line below the last name on each form and initial this line indicating that no other signatures will be recorded on the form. 3.CONTRACT FOOD SERVICE PERSONNEL. Activities that have c ontract food servic e personnel will pay at the point of sale for meals at the time of consumption. 4.NIGHT AND BRUNCH MEALS. Meals served between 2000 and 0300 will be recorded as night meals. Brunch meals served before 0900 will be recorded as breakfast meals and brunch meals served after 0900 will be recorded as lunch meals. ASHORE regions that offer continuous feeding at their facilities shall begin the lunch meal rate at 1000. 5.SPECIAL MEAL FEEDING. Special meal feeding includes picnics, barbecues, cookouts, and other similar events.

The individual supervising the event must mak e arrangements with the FSO to assign a GM cashier at the event or to make other arrangements to collec t money for meals sold for c ash. Th e number of personnel must be reported on NAVSUP Form 1292 for the GM meal that the special event replaced. NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 2-476.MASS FEEDING. Mass feeding means accounting for a group of personnel by using a Recapitulation of Meal Record (NAVSUP Form 1292) as a summary document instead of obtaining individual signatures on the Meal Signature Record (NAVSUP Form 1291). Mass feeding occurs at recruit training centers, schools, brigs, and with groups fed outside the GM such as picnic events or boat crews. Further information about mass feeding is di scussed below. a.Adding Personnel with REVS.

The Audit Board is responsible for ensuring compliance with procedures contained in this publication, the checklists contained in Appendix I, the validationof signature head count totals, and the verification of monthly ration credit totals. 3.MONT HLY REVIEW OF PROCEDURES . The Audit Board shall conduct a thorough review of head count procedures at least once each month. 4.REVS AUTOMATED SYSTEM AUDIT . For GMs using the REVS automated system, the audit shall ensure that the proper protocol is exercised to ensur e the security and safety of PII when a customer's CAC is handled and scanned. The audit also shall determine that the Command ensures that proper information is recorded and reflected on the customer's pay and personnel record. The Audi t Board shall observe procedures used during a meal to review compliance with regulations . Specific procedures to observe include the careful handling and scanning of CAC cards, cash handling, obtaining legible signatures (for messes not using the automated system), and documenting overrides in the automated system for certain situations such as mass feeding of select groups. 5.AUDIT OF RATION CREDIT TOTALS . The purpose of the audit of ration credit totals is to verify daily ration credit figures and to ensure that all monthly forms used to record ration credit totals are in agreement . The audit of ration credit totals may be conducted monthly or as required by local command procedures. The A udit Board will first review the daily NAVSUP Form 1291, the DD Form 1544 sheets, and NAVSUP Form 1292. The total number of ration credits for each category of personnel on the daily documents must agree with the daily summary NAVSUP Form 1292. The Audit Board then shall review the month's daily summary NAVSUP Form 1292 documents . The total NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 2-54number of ration credits for each category of personnel on the daily documents must agree with the daily summary NAVSUP Form 1292. The Audit Board shall review the month's daily summary NAVSUP Form 1292 documents . The total number of ration credits must agree with the monthly NAVSUP Form 1292 prepared for the Audit Board by the FSO . The Audit Board then shall review the following records to ensure that the monthly total ration credit figures agree: Monthly NAVSUP Form 1292 Monthly NAVSUP Form 338 Monthly NAVSUP Form 1359 Accommodations for rounding errors will be accounted for following the procedures outlined in Paragraph 2305.3 . The RK shall sign the first signature line of the NAVSUP Form 1292 monthly recapitulation and shall pass it to t he Audit Board who shall make any required corrections and will reconcile all corrections with the FSO (the FSO shall initial the changes and sign the monthly NAVSUP Form 1292). The signed original monthly NAVSUP Form 1292 document shall be sent back to the FSO with the daily summary NAVSUP Form 1292s. Upon completion of the audit, all audited daily NAVSUP Form 1292s will be maintained for 10 years . NAVSUP Form 1291s will be discarded after command audit is complete. 6.REPORTS TO THE COMMANDING OFFICER. The Audit Board shall make a summary report of audit findings to the Commanding Officer after conducting each audit. The report must include a statement citing compliance with procedures and directives or the report must state otherwise. Problems in controlling meal passes , determining eligibility for personnel in the serving line, or documenting mass feeding must be reported when discovered. The Audit Board shall retain the summary report after the Commanding Officer's review and shall forward one copy to the activity's FSO. The summary report, and the working papers used to develop the report, s hall b e retained for 10 year in the non-accountability file. If any individual discovers personnel on BAS eating meals at government expense, the individual must take appropriate action to document the offense properly. A report must be made to the Commanding Officer or to the Command to which the perpetrator is attached for appropriate action. 7.REPORTS TO THE SUPPORT SERVICES DIRECTORATE, FOOD SERVICE DIVISION (NAVSUP N432). The FSO shall submit corrected reports and returns resulting from audits of ration credit totals by following the procedures discussed in Paragraph 700 4 (P-486, Chapter 7) for submitting corrected reports and returns to NAVSUP N 432.NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 2-55 Figure 2-1 6 NAVSUP Form 1291 Meal S ignature Record 29 JUN 14 30 JUN 13 Personnel who do not possess a meal pass use their DoD ID number.

Days at sea include the day of leaving and the day of returning to port . The time of departure or return does not matter . Ration credit must be taken for all enlisted personnel entitled to RIK in the GM plus ration credits obtained by converting meals sold for cash to rations. 2.SEA DU TY. Sea Duty is any service performed in a self -propelled vessel with berthing and messing facilities that is in an active status, in commission, or in service. This term applies to members who are either permanent party or aboard for temporary duty . All members on sea duty who are not a member of an authorized private mess will be charged for all meals made available whether eaten or not, subject to approved missed meals . (Ref: DoD 7000.14 -R Financial Management Regulation Volume 7A, Chapter 25) . 3.DAYS IN PO RT. In port means at berth or at anchor in ports located in the United States or overseas when liberty is granted . Ration credit shall be taken only for meals fed, except for the day of leaving and the day of returning to port as mentioned above. 4.SIMU LATED AT SEA EXERCISES. Take full ration credit for all enlisted personnel aboard ship who are entitled to meals served during the time period of the simulated at sea exercises . While conducting simulated at sea exercises, and when personnel cannot leave the ship, cash paying customers (such as officers and ship riders) shall be charged for all meals made available. R ation credit is obtained by converting meals sold for cash to rations during days of simulated at sea exercises in port. These exercises include for example, fast cruise, general quarters, force protection drills, and engineering casualty control (ECC) drills. 5.CROSS ING THE INTERNATIONAL DATELINE . Ration allowances shall be adjusted to compensate for the change in the calendar day resulting from crossing the 180th meridian . When time is set back one day in crossing from the west (Japan) to the east (United States), ration credits shall be taken for the extra day and a menu shall be created for the gained day in the FSM system . See Appendix A for a discussion of this topic . When the time is advanced one day in crossing from the east (United States) to the west (Japan), ration credits shall not betaken for the lost day. 6.HOLI DAY RATION CREDITS . On Thanksgiving and Christmas, the Pre- Meal Task Food Preparation Worksheet Holiday ration credi ts must be applied by selecting one of the Holiday Ration Credit formulas that are preset in FSM to record the correct sale of meal rates andration credit formula. The Holiday Ration Credit Conversion Factors are 35, 65 ; 20, 65, 15 ; or 20, 15, 65. These are the only ration credit formulas allowed for the two holidays . The 1282 is not changeable or repairable once the information has been posted. If the setting of the Pre- Meal Tasks Food Prep Worksheet was in error, it must be corrected by deleting the entire approved 1090 and recreating it with the correct holiday ration credit selected before posting any expenditures and/or issues or before recording headcounts for the day . 2401 RATIONS ALLOWED NUMBER AFLOAT 1.EXECUTIVE OFFICER OR PERSONNEL OFFICER. The Executive Officer or the Personnel Officer will provide a copy of the daily muster report to the FSO. Discussions concernin g scheduled visits or circumstances affecting the number of rations allowed should be included for planning purposes.NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 2-612.FOREIGN AND OTHER PERSONNEL RATIONS .

Prepar ing a summary document, using the ship's daily muster reports, of the rations allowed for the monthly (or accounting period) General Mess Summary Document (NAVSUP Form 1359) as discussed in Chapter 7. 2402 ACCURATE COUNTING 1.INPORT/UNDERWAY . An accurate count of all personnel consuming meals from the GM shall be taken inport/underway using a mechanical counting device. Accurate head counts reduce food waste, provide historical information for planning endurance loading, and can assist during menu preparation. Accurate head counts also serve as the basis for recording the daily ration credit. 2.SPECIAL EVENTS. An accurate count of all types of personnel eating meals at barbecues, cookouts, picnics , and other special events supported by the GM ensures that appropriate ration credits will be taken. The FSO shall undertake the following : Review the appropriate ration credits . Review and sign the appropriate documents to ensure all food items used were included in the daily issue documents to the GM. Ensure an accurate number of personnel attending the event was included in theappropriate column(s) of NAVSUP Form 338 . 2403 RECORDING AFLOAT RATION CREDIT 1.DAILY MUSTER REPORT. The daily muster report shall include the total number of enlisted personnel assigned (less personnel on leave, TAD/TDY, co nfined not onboard, and unauthoriz ed absentees). This number should include enlisted members on Temporary Afloat Assignment (TAA) status who are receiving BAS with a deduction from pay for meals served while on TAA status and who are treated as RIK for food service accounting purposes. The muster report informs the FSO of the total number of enlisted personnel entitled to RIK. The following three paragraphs discuss recording rations on the General Mess Control Record (NAVSUP Form 338) for afloat ac tivities. 2.RATIONS SOLD FOR CASH. Meals sold for cash are recorded on the Cash Meal Payment Book (DD Form 1544) Sheets in accordance with Paragraph 2201-3, and meals sold on a credit basis are recorded on the Sale of General Mes s Meals (NAVSUP Form 1046) in accordance with Paragraph 2201-2 b.

The F SO maintains financial accountability and control of the GM within an allowed monetary amount . Providing high quality meals within a prescribed monetary allowance requires managerial skills and constant attention from the FSO and food service division. The m onetary allowance amount depends on the number of personnel served in the GM and the current values of the authorized food allowances for the GM. A computation converts the number of personnel to ration credits . Multiplying the number of ration credits by the authorized food allowance value provides a monetary allowance. A ration credit represents the quantity of food required to serve one person three meals daily. Each meal represents a portion or percentage of a ration credit . The current NAVSUPNOTE 7330 contains these percentages (or ration credit conversion factors) . Using regular feeding factors, if one person eats only breakfast, 25 percent of a ration is earned; l unch is 40 percent of a ration earned, and dinner is 35 percent of a ration ea rned. Ration credit may not be claimed more than once for the same meal . Ration credit may not exceed 1.0 ration per person per day. The FSO s hall manage the GM operation and shall not exceed the monthly (or reporting period's ) authorized monetary allowance amount . The FSO must devote constant attention to the GM operation and must exercise close financial control over feeding costs . This requires effective menu planning, strict daily breakout control, correct inventory procedures, efficient food conservation programs , and review of daily ration cost control measures. The F SO is required to review the daily ration cost on NAVSUP Forms 338 and NAVSUP Form 1359. This is especially important and necessary during inport periods . Each week the FSO shall print out NAVSUP Form 338, review it, sign it, and retain it with the monthly returns . An accurate count for meals provided during inport periods will ensure computing proper monetary allowances . Comparing the menu items with the daily issue documents to the GM reduces inventory adjustments during the account period. Speci al events such as barbecues, cookouts, or picnics must be reviewed to determine the effect on the current over issue or under issue status of the GM. Consc ientious management action ensures that the GM records reflect an under issue status at the end of each accounting period. P rompt and effective action must be taken to ensure that the cost of rations remains within the authorized allowance. 2501 DAILY RATION ALLOWAN CES AND MONETARY VAL UES 1.BASIC DAILY FOOD ALLOWANCE . The basic daily food allowance (BDFA) is a set quantity of food required to provide a nutritionally adequate daily diet for one person. It can be defined by com ponents or monetary value. The m onetary value of a BDFA is developed from the standard Department of Defense (DoD) Food Cost Index . The authority for this index stems from a Presidential Executive Order and from the current DoD appropriation act . The current NAVSUPNOTE 7330 issues the BDFA monetary value, Special Allowances, Master Load List (NAVSUP Form 1059), and general information on food items. NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 2-682.SUPPLEMENTAL FOOD ALLOWANCE. The supplemental allowance is a set quantity of food that can be defined by components and by the quantity of monetary value used to support a small daily ration total (except for submarines) . The supplemental allowance is added when the BDFA alone cannot support a GM in accordance with the current NAVSUPNOTE 7330 . The Supplemental Food Allowances can be used by all GMs , excluding submarines, that have the following: 1 to 99 total rations fed per day 100 to 149 total rations fed per day Appropr iate monetary rates for these Supplemental Food Allowances can be found in the current NAVSUPNOTE 7330 published quarterly by NAVSUP N432. Only one Supplemental Food Allowance may be used on any particular day. Branc h messes shall use the supplemental allowance only when meals actually are prepared in the branch facility. 3.SPECIAL FOOD ALLOWANCE. A special food allowance is a set quantity of food, defined by monetary value, required to support unusual or special circumstances . A special food allowance is used in addition to the BDFA when the BDFA alone is insufficient and will not support the GM under certain unusual or special circumstances . The following list shows NAVSUPNOTE 7330 special allowances : Submarines NAVSUP- directed DoD Birthday /Special Events , Thanksgiving , and Christmas Day holiday meals Newly established GM s for the first 30 days of operation, and GMs temporarily closed for 30 days or more Ships in a repair yard for a period of time with limited crew or when subsisting from a barge. Prime Vendor Allowance ( PVA). The monetary value of the PV Allowance will depend on the servicing Prime Vendor for the Ashore or Afloat Units . The allowance will automatically be activated daily and may change in monetary value depending upon the Prime Vendor used to purchase subsistence. As a subsistence order is received, t he RK must use the current NAVSUPNOTE 7330 , which is published on a quarterly basis by NAVSUP, to determine the applicable PV Allowance to load into the Food Service Management (FSM) System . A Non -Prime Vendor support allowance is available f or those areas , such as Australia or South America, without Prime Vendor Support or for those receiving R eplenishment at Sea (RAS) Husbanding Agent . All allowances will be activated automatically on a daily basis in FSM until the next delivery has been received from a nother source/supplier . The following list provides further information: oWhen in homeport, the assigned homeport PVA shall be used upon receipt of a subsistence order . This allowance shall continue to be take n until next delivery has been received from another supplier/source. oWhen deployed within CONUS and receiving subsistence, the PVA correlating to the Prime Vendor from which the subsistence order was received shall be used . This allowance shall continue to be taken until the next delivery has been received from another supplier/source. oWhen deployed overseas, the PVA for an assigned overseas vendor shall be used upon receipt of a subsistence order . This allowance shall continue to be taken until the next delivery has been received from another supplier/source . oWhen receiving subsistence in areas without Prime Vendor support or without RAS, the non- prime vendor support allowance shall be used . This allowance shallNAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 2-69continue to be taken until the next delivery has been receiv ed from another supplier/source. NOTE : PVA rates do not apply to transfers (with or without reimbursement). 4.AUTHO RITY . The c urrent NAVSUPNOTE 7330 lists the authorized supplemental and special food allowances . The monetary amounts for the supplemental and special food allowances are developed together with the BDFA. The c urrent NAVSUPNOTE 7330 does not include all possible situations that may justify special allowances . Requests for additional allowances shall be submitted in a timely manner to NAVSUP N432 via the appropriate Chain of Command . Requests must include substantiating justification. Submitting requests in a timely manner allows use of the additional allowance during the appropriate accounting period(s). Do not submit additional allowance requests for the sole purpose of supplementing a GM in an over issue condition. 2502 RECORDING THE DAILY MONETARY ALLOWANCE 1.TOTAL DAILY RATION CREDIT . Part D and Part E of this Chapter discuss how to determine meals sold for cash and meals fed RIK and how to record these rations on the General Mess Control Record (NAVSUP Form 338) . The procedures for recording the total daily and cumulative ration credits are shown below ( see Figure 2 -24): Data Block and Caption Instruction for Entry (12) RIK/Cash Sales Column (6) + Column (11) (round Daily Total to the nearest whole ration) (13) Cumulative Total Column (12) + the previous day 's Column (13) 2.COMP UTING MONETARY ALLOWANCE . The procedures for recording the daily and cumulative monetary allowance on the General Mess Control Record (NAVSUP Form 338) are shown below ( see Figure 2 -24): Data Block and Caption Instruction for Entry (14) Daily Monetary Column (12) x the monetary allowance Allowance (BDFA plus added allowances) (15) Cumulative Total Column (14) + the previous day 's Column (15). 2503 EFFECTIVE MONETARY R ATION ALLOWANCE 1.REVISED ALLOWANCES. Monetary ration allowances are revised quarterly and become effective on the first day of the quarter that follows the published date . 2.OPERAT ING A GENERAL MESS ON A BARGE OR SIMILAR SHIP. COs may have to operate a GM aboard a barge, barracks ship, or similar facility . This may occur because of overhaul, renovation by the shipyard of food service facilities , or during a decommissioning phase. The CO may place the enlisted crew members on full BAS resulting in a cash sale Afloat General Mess operation that presents a challenge to maintain a solvent food service operation in accordance with Paragraph 2504. Therefore, an afloat GM in this situation shall continue to use the applicable BDFA , the Supplemental Allowances, and the Afloat Maintenance Availability Special Allowances . An afloat GM in this situation shall continue to use monetary allowances applicable to afloat units for ration credit determination and shall continue to submit all required returns.NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 2-702504 BASIC ALLOWANCE FOR SUBSISTENCE (BAS) The term BA S used throughout this manual is defined as a cash allowance payable to enlisted personnel who are permitted to mess separately in lieu of RIK when messing facilities are available. BAS will be authorized in accordance with the Department of Defense Milit ary Pay and Allowance Entitlements Manual and the Naval Personnel Manual . For additional information refer to Department of Defense Directive 1418.5 and to DOD 7000.14- R, VOLUME 7A, CHAPTER 25, \"SUBSISTENCE ALLOWANCES\" . NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 2-71Figure 2-24 NAVSUP Form 338 Recording Total Daily Ration Credits and Ration Allowances to the General Mess Control Record NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 2-72PART G: SITUATION FEEDING AND ALLOWANCE S 2600 NIGHT MEALS AND MID -RATIONS 1.GENERAL. Night meals provide personnel with the opportunity to substitute a night meal for a meal missed earlier in the day because of standing watch or because of other assigned duties. Personnel standing watches or performing other assigned duties between 2000 and 0300 may receive a night meal. A maximum of one ration credit per person per day will be claimed regardless of the number of night meals an individual receives. Night meals must have a separate and distinct menu from the other meals provided during the day. Include the value of food items used to prepare night meals in the total cost of issues to the GM. Ration credit and sales of night meals will follow the rates published in the current NAVSUPNOTE 7330. 2.ASHORE. Personnel entitled to RIK receiving a night meal at a s hore activity will sign a Meal S ignature Record (NAVSUP Form 1291). Use a separate Cash Meal Payment Sheet (DD For m 1544) marked \"other cash sales\" to record cash sales of night meals. (R EV System users are not required to use the NAVSUP Form 1291 and DD Form 1544). 3.AFLOAT (IN PORT). FSOs have the discretion to authorize night meals. Pe rsonnel receiving a night meal in port must have approval from the division officer based on the muster report provided for those personnel. Night meals are designated for personnel who missed a regular scheduled meal based on their evening work schedule. Report the number of personnel receiving night meals during in port periods in the appropriate columns (5) or (10) on the General Mess Control Record (NAVSUP Form 338). Ration credit for night meals can only be taken dur ing inport periods. 4.AFLOAT (UNDERWAY) NIGHT MEALS (MIDRATS). These are ad ditional meals that contain the same nutritional components as lunch and dinner. Night meals must follow Navy standard core menu guidelines required by menu review criteria. The night meal must contain a healthy ent r\u00e9e, starch, vegetables, and fruits. Unprepared leftovers may be used in addition to the night m eal menu. Leftovers cannot be the only option offered. Creative use of uncooked l eftovers, grab and go snacks, fruit and salad bars, and e ggs to order are highly recommended strategies to be used during MIDRATS. Extreme care should be taken when leftovers are served to ensure that the food safety requirements for serving leftovers, as indicated in NAVMED P -5010, Chapter 1, are strictly followed. RIK per sonnel are entitled to three meals per day. The MIDRATS meal is in lieu of a missed meal . Night meals are intended to be served to personnel who are assigned to an on/off going watch section or night work shift and m ust take into consideration the work schedules required by all personnel . Every effort should be made to prepare and serve quality night meals to authorized personnel . The value of food items used to prepare MIDRATS will be in the total cost of issues to the GM for the day the breakout took place. Claiming ration credit and/or sale for the MIDRATS is not authorized when ration credit for every person on board has been taken at breakfast, lunch , and dinner. 2601 RECREATIONAL EVENTS 1.GENERAL . Instead of a meal served in the GM, t he CO may allow issuing food items from the GM to authorized personnel for use for picnics and other forms of recreation. However, the statutory limitations governing use of appropriated funds that place restrictions on the issuance and sale of meals must be followed in all circumstances . The FSO must ensure that onlyNAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 2-73personnel entitled to R IK receive, from the GM at government expense, cooked or uncooked food for picnics or other forms of recreation. Enlist ed personnel receiving BAS, officers, dependents , and other guests must pay the published sale of meal rates that is published in the current NAVSUPNOTE 7330 . The FSO will arrange with the activity , 7 working days before the placement of the food order, for the activity to collect and to bring all monies to the FSO . A duty cash collection agent shall receive all money and shall verify that all paperwork matches the amount of rations being made. This needs to be done in advance for the proper posting of the rations into the FSM computer and for the correct deposit of monies for that given day. The Leading CS ma y develop a standardized picnic or recreational event menu. This w ill provide standardiz ation and will help the requesting activities with making their selections. 2.DOCUMENTA TION . The FSO will require a written request for picnic or recreational rations 7 working days before the event to allow for proper thawing and prepar ation of meat products and for collection of the cash and verification of the paperwork. All paper work and cash must be submitted 7 working days before the picnic and/or recreational event to allow for placement of the food order, verification of the paperwork, and collection of all monies . This is a commitment from the activity that the event will take place. Figure 2 -25 provides a sample memorandum to use for requesting picnic or recreational event rations . The request must include the following inf ormation: Name of activity requesting the rations . Number of personnel and date of the picnic or recreational event . Names of personnel entitled to RIK . (Use a Recapitulation of Meal Record (NAVSUP Form 1292). This is required only for ashore activities) . Number of officers attending . Number of civilians attending . Number of MFMs of and below attending (discounted rate) . Number of MFMs of E5 and below attending (standard rate) . Number of personnel attending the event who receive an allowance for subsistence (if applicable). Total cash collected. Picnic menu, pick up time, and the name of the person authorized to pick up the rations . Signature of the requesting official. 3.RECREATI ON FISHING FROM DEPLOYED VESSELS. Privately caught fish on board U.S. Navy vessels may be consumed at the Commander 's discretion and with, ideally , veterinary consultation or , at a minimum , consultation with medical personnel if they have knowledge about fish health and processing. Privately caught fish must not be the only option at a meal; regular food and/o r meals must be provided.

Navy commands traditionally sponsor social events and ceremonies to acknowledge noteworthy accomplishments and achievements of Navy personnel . Command functions that recogniz e personnel promotions, reenlistments, command milestones, and other similar events are vital to morale and tradition. Policies governing the u se of Military Labor for ceremonial events must be strictly adhered to . Refer to Appendix E, Command Functions and O rganization . 2.C EREMONIAL CAKES. The afloat FSO may approve requests to purchase ceremonial cakes on a case -by-case basis when there are adequate personnel and facilities to support t he addi tional workload. The use of subsistence appropriation funds to defray the cost of f ood i tems is not authorized. These transactions must be handled as sales of bulk food items i n ac cordance with Chapter 6, P aragraph 6302 for afloat procedures. Bulk sales are not authorized for ashore GMs without CNIC and NAVSUP N432 approval. 2603 BATTLE FEEDING 1.GENERAL . The Damage Control Assistant has responsibility for the afloat battle feedi ng pl an. The Base Disaster Preparedness Plan contains information on battle feeding a shore .NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 2-75Every attempt should be made to assign food service personnel to the galley and associated food service spaces during battle stations and C ondition Three steaming. 2.FEE DING ON STATION. Distribution of food to battle station lockers ensures availability for battle feeding. Food that does not require galley preparation , or semi -perishable food distributed in this manner , requires constant checking . This checking provides periodic rotation of food items to prevent spoilage, misuse, or theft. Food carriers, racks, trays, and large coffee pots must be available to support battle feeding needs. 3.BATTL E FOOD PREPARATION. Battle food preparation will depend on whether the galley is in operation and whether CSs are available. If a galley or personnel are not available, meal - ready -to-eat (MRE) rations may be used and supplemented with hot or cold drinks . When limited galley food service is available, the planned menu items should include items such as sandwiches, fresh or canned fruit, hot entr\u00e9es such as canned beef stew or chili con carne, easy -to-prepare and serve recipes , and a hot or cold drink . 4.GALL EY FEEDING . Personnel who are relieved from battle stations should go to the galley or to other auxiliary feeding stations for hot food . Various auxiliary feeding stations may be set up when the situation does not allow access to the galley. 5.OFF ICERS IN BATTLE FEEDING SITUATIONS . Officers eating meals at the GM during battle feeding situations must pay regular meal rates in accordance with the current NAVSUPNOTE 7330 . Afloat units will sell meals from the GM to officers on a credit basis to simplify procedures during the emergency . 6.BATTL E FEEDING/BASE FORCE PROTECTION EMERGENCY ASHORE. CO s may authorize civilian personnel to purchase meals from the galley in the event of a Force Protection Emergency .NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 3-1 CHAPTER 3 STANDARD CORE MENU AND FOOD PREPARATION Part A: NAVY STANDARD MENU AND FOOD PREPARATION References, Resources, and Tools ....................................................................................3000 Navy Standard Core Menu (NSCM) ...................................................................................3001 Basic Guides for Food Preparation ....................................................................................3002 Food Preparation Worksheet .............................................................................................3003 Suggestions for the Food Service Officer ..........................................................................3004 Par t B: CONSERVATION OF FOOD Conservation Measures ....................................................................................................3100 Part C: MENU SUPPORT PROGRAMS MyPlate .............................................................................................................................3200 Joint Subsistence Advisory Board .....................................................................................3201 Go For Green\u00ae ..................................................................................................................3202 NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 3-2CHAPTER 3 NAVY STANDARD CORE MENU __________________________________________________________________ PART A: NAVY STANDARD MENU AND FOOD PREPAR ATION 3000 REF ERENCES, RESOURCES , AND TOOLS 1.GENERAL . The Navy Menu is an important asset that is vital to mission success. Menus provide nutritious and flavorful meals using the Basic Daily Food Allowance (BDFA) . Continuous menu development depends on Fleet involvement and the participation of food service personnel at shore facilities and on ships and submarines . A wel l-planned menu uses f ood service personnel's experience and feedback from C ommand surveys, menu production, and menu review boards. All C ommands must implement the current graded Navy menus for their platform using approved subsistence items from NAV SUPNOTE 7330 Master Load List (MLL) . Menus must exhibit Go For Green (G4G) color codes . 2.GLUTEN FREE INGREDIENTS . Gluten free ingredients shall not be procured for Service Members (SMs) . The specific instruction that addresses gluten intolerance as a medical condition that may qualify for service disqualification is found in DODI 6130.03 Medical Standards For Appointment, Enlistment and Induction Into The Military Services, page 21, Section 5.12c(3) . This instruction establishes the policy for physical and medical standards . Small and large intestine diseases, including celiac disease, that require the elimination of gluten free foods is addressed in this instruction . For more information refer to the following website: https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodi/613003p.pdf?ver=2018- 05-04- 113917- 883 3.VEGETARIAN INGREDIENTS. There is a growing interest in vegetarian ingredients . The Armed Forces Recipe Service (AFRS) contains vegetarian recipes that continue to be developed to increase the options available for menu updates . These recipes will use the MLL ingredients and will not be vegan specific. 4.PLA TFORM MENUS . Use of t he AFRS is mandatory in all General Messes ( GMs ) to standardize food preparation using recipes available in FSM . AFRS G4G -coded recipe use is mandatory for all GMs . There are no hard copies of this file because it is a living document with recipes being added continuously . These recipes are available in FSM and on the MyNAVSUP website (path: Sites>Navy Food Service>Documents> Armed Forces Recipe Service ). Registration is required to access the My NAVSUP Navy Fo od Service page. Further guidance is provided below. a.Guideline Cards . Guideline cards are found in Section A of AFRS . They eliminate the need to repeat the same information on recipe cards . Guideline cards include the following : Information on food breakouts food handling measuring procedures/equivalents conversion charts equipment guidelines b.Index Cards . Index cards are found at the beginning of each section of AFRS . The index card gives a complete listing, in numerical order by type of food or dish, of all recipes contained in that section.NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 3-3 c. R ecipe C lassification . Based on the preparation process , all AFRS recipes fall into the three Navy recipe classifications discussed below. (1)Scratch . Any recipe made from ingredients that require further proces sing before the dish can be assembled, cooked, and served. (2)Speed Scratch . A speed scratch recipe combines convenient or ready -made food products with ingredients such as fresh fruits and vegetables to create recipes that save time and labor . Portioned cuts of meats, premade sauces, and frozen dough are examples of products used in creating a speed scratch recipe . (3)Prepared/Ready To Use (RTU) . An RTU recipe is defined as one that is ready to eat, is heat and serve, or has water added water and then is cook ed. This includes steamed rice, instant mashed potatoes, and frozen and/or processed vegetables. 5.NAVY FO OD SERVICE (NAVSUP P- 476)/NAVSUP FOOD FLASH . NAVSUP N432 publishes the Navy Food Service (NAVSUP P- 476) quarterly and the NAVSUP Food Flashes as necessary . Both are post ed on MY NAVSUP https://www.my.navsup.navy.mil/group/food -services/home and are distributed to all activities with GMs . Commands are required to retain the P- 476 and NAVSUP Food Flash on hardcopy or electronically for 2 years . The P-476 and Food Flashes may contain policy updates and information for the following: Ingredients and/or recipes Galley equipment GM modernization Publication revisions Sanitation Food service automation Training Food preparation Food service operations Nutrition Menu planning Suggested special event /holiday menus Recordkeeping The Food Service Officer (FSO) or the Leading Culinary Specialist (LCS) will make available every issue of the Navy Food Service (P -476) and the NAVSUP Food Flashes to each Culinary Specialist (CS). The LCS will document and ensure that each CS is aware of food service policy changes and updates in these publications . The FSO, LCS, Training Petty Officer , Records Keeper, Bulk St oreroom Custodian, Galley Captain , and Watch Captains are required to initial the front cover of the P -476 after reviewing it . 6.MENU REVIEW . All afloat platform specific menus and region al menus from Commander Naval Installation Command (CNIC) are required to have their menus evaluated annually by the NAVSUP dietitian. All menus shall be forwarded to the NAVSUP functional mailbox at navsup_foodservice@navy.mil. Additional ashore specific location menu requests to NAVSUP N432 will be reviewed and forwarded from CNIC 925. Each CNIC region must have one menu. CNIC Regional Directors must submit menus to the CNIC HQ Point of Contact (POC) appointed by the CNIC Ashore Food Service Director to validate the accuracy of the recipe name, number, a nd G4G codes. The NAVSUP dietitian shall email receipt acknowledgment of all menu reviews and return those that have inaccurate G4G codes and/o r that are non-c ompliant with G4G menu planning policy to the CNIC HQ POC for modification and resubmission. Additional guidance is provided below. NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 3-4a.Menu Review Process . Menu reviews will be given a pass or fail on the basis of compliance with Go For Green\u00ae and menu planning guidelines . Comments and/or recommendations must be provided in narrative format and must include new recipe development suggestions from Fleet-driven requests . CNIC may expect an electronic copy of the approved menu review from the NAVSUP dietitian within 45 days . The Type Commander ( TYCOM ) must email this documentation to all C ommands within the region to maintain for inspections . b.AFLOAT Menus . AFLOAT menus will be developed with TYCOM and NAVSUP during an annual menu development seminar . TYCOM must distribute the menu review to all platform s' FSO or LCS to maintain for inspections. c. M enu Review Criteria . The menu shall be evaluated on the basis of its compliance with the standards outlined in this Chapter . Submitted menus are evaluated to ensure that their food categories comply with G4G menu planning goals : lunch and dinner meals must offer green- coded categories that include an entr\u00e9e, starch, vegetable, bread, soup, dessert, beverage, and fruit . Requirements (discussed below) differ for small and large platforms . The s ize of a food service operation affects how these goals are applied. (1)Small Menu Criteria (Submarine) . When two recipes are offered in a category, a green - coded recipe must be offered and the additional recipe may be yellow - or red- coded. When deployed and only serving one item from each food category, a green- coded recipe must be offered at lunch or dinner when offering only one recipe in each category (deployed NSCM). (2) Medium/ s). When two or more recipes are offered for a category, one must be green- coded and the others in that category may be green - or yellow -coded. There may be only one red- coded recipe from each category . An example for starches is to offer a baked potato that codes G, f rench fries that code R, and mashed potatoes that code Y . Onion rings could not then be offered because they are coded R. 7.MENU RE QUIREMENTS . The following requirements must be incorporated into menus: Breakfast shall offer green -coded options including egg whites and/or egg substitutes, beans, salsa, oatmeal, whole grain bread, beverages (decaf tea and/or coffee, one percent milk, and water) , and fruit. The menu shall incorporate fresh fruits and/or vegetables that contain anti-oxidants and a variety of fiber sources . Examples are whole grain breads and/or cereals, legumes (kidney beans, baked beans), brown or wild rice, and quinoa. The menu shall be aesthetically pleasing in terms of complementary flavors, textures, colors , and shapes . Only NAVSUP P- 7 AFRS Index recipes posted on MY NAVSUP shall be used. Popular foods shall not be overscheduled on the menu or served at consecutive meals or on consecutive days. Red meat (beef, pork, ham, veal, and liver) shall be offered throughout the menu. When two entrees are served at a meal, one shall be meat, poultry, fish, or a vegetarian option. When two entrees are served at a meal, one shall be a hot entr\u00e9e and the other may be a sandwich. When two vegetables are served, one shall be a non- starch veg etable and one may be a starchy vegetable. 8.MENU BOARDS . There are two independent Menu Boards (discussed below) : Menu Production Boards (MPB s) that review the preparation of menus by Food Service Division /personnel and Menu Review Boards ( MRB s) made up of patrons/customers providing reviews and feedback of menus to the Food Service Division. a.Menu Production Board. This Board is composed of CSs and is chaired by the LCS or the S-2 Leading Petty Officer . The Watch Captain(s) and cooks on watch provide feedback forNAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 3-5 menu production. This Board shall meet monthly to review menu acceptability and the Command's customer survey comments . Food service personnel must use NAVSUP Form 1090 (Food Preparation Worksheets) to plan and discuss preparation techniques . Emphasis must be placed on the resources and limitations of the food service operation (storage , manning, and equipment) while maintaining quality nutritious meals . Feedback must be submitted to NAVSUP via TYCOM with the quarterly MRB minutes. b.Menu Review Board. This Board shall consist of representatives from as many divisions as possible. The Board's composition may vary from one representative from each division to a broader membership depending on the Command's schedule . An MRB session shall be conducted quarterly . The Board will be chaired by the FSO or by the LCS in the FSO's absence. The purpose of the B oard is to have patron representatives communicate recommendations for future menu revisions to the F ood Service Division . The board provides a mechanism for providing patrons with an understanding of the resources andlimitations of t he food service operation and to educate personnel about current NAVSUPNOTE 7330 changes . The MRB minutes shall be recorded, routed through the Chain of Command for signature, and kept on file in the food service office for one year . A copy of the minutes shall be forwarded to NAVSUP via TYCOM. 9.COMM AND FOOD SURVEY . These surveys help determine the crew's preference. Surveys must be made available during each meal because tastes change, new personnel arrive, and new foods and recipes are introduced. A food service team member shall track the crew's preferences to assess acceptability and to make it easier to predict the necessary portions . Any circumstances that may affect acceptability shall be noted. Command menu surveys shall be submitted to the NAVSUP Mailbox ( navsup_foodservice@navy.mil ) via TYCOM and/or CNIC with MRB. 10.RATI ON IN KIND (RIK) FEEDERS . The Memorandum of Agreement for RIK feeders state s that meals shall comply with the NAVSUP nutrition policy . NAVSUP complies with the Go For Green\u00ae and DoD menu planning standards that mandate that a green entr\u00e9e, starch, vegetable, soup, bread, beverage, and dessert must be provided at each meal ; there must be an alternate option coded yellow or red. The codes for AFRS recipes are located on the MY NAVSUP site: https://my.navsup.navy.mil at (path: Sites> Navy Food Service>Documents>G4G folders ). Recipe numbers for all coded recipes must come from the NAVSUP G4G Food Service Management(FSM ) Recipe Coding resource. Additional information on menus and meal attendance predictions is discussed below. a. Menus . Menus shall be submitted to the functional mailbox navsup_foodservice@navy.mil on the approved template. This template requires the recipe name, number, and the Go For Green\u00ae color code and sodium code for each recipe listed on the menu. If the feeder is using recipes from the contractor and not from the AFRS, the recipes must be submitted to the NAVSUP Dietitia n for coding . Specific manufacturer label information containing nutrient data also must be provided with the submission . The codes sha ll be sent back to the feeder for adding to their menu. The feeder menu will be evaluated only for menu compliance if Go For Green\u00ae menu coding is on the menu template. b.Meal Attendance Predictions . The procedures for effective meal attendance predictions and food cost analysis are discussed below.(1)Ashore units shall use signature headcounts and meals sold for cash records to document actual persons fed . (2)Afloat units underway shall receive full ration credit daily for all enlisted personnel and officers entitled to be fed at sea. A mechanical counting device shall be used to count persons fed for determining ration credit during inport periods based on the number ofmeals actually fed. At sea, a counting device shall be used to count persons fed as a tool for assisting the Watch Captain with NAVSUP 1090 preparation and for historical data.NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 3-6(3)Head count records are not required to show how many persons are served at each meal; this practice is, however, recommended . The same historical data may be acquired by retaining the food preparation worksheet (NAVSUP Form 1090) for sixcomplete cycles of the menu to accurately predict meal attendance. Estimates of future attendance are based on past records and on Command's circumstances and experience. Factors such as weather, proximity to payday, and liberty trends must be taken into account when predicting attendance. 11. FOO D COST ANALYSIS. Variations in meal attendance from day -to-day and meal -to-meal affect monetary allowances and food costs . It is critical that a periodic analysis of average head count predictions and historical food cost data performed by the Food Servi ce Officer to assist in managing a solvent GM operation. A tool is available in FSM to use the pre- daily NAVSUP Form 1282 to identify food costs . 3001 NA VY STANDARD CORE MENU 1.GENERAL. The NSCM provides a platform-sp ecific deployed and non-deployed menus to all Navy Com mands that meet Go For Green\u00ae menu coding goals and DoD Menu Standards for H uman Performance Optimization. The cycle menus provide more accurate forecasting for ration costs, requisition requirements, and daily food preparation. The NSCM has the following characteristics : It is d esigned to comply with the Basic Daily Food Allowance (BDFA). Items chosen are based on their quality and acceptability. It provides standardization and consistency of products across platforms. It contributes to more accurate financial management and control. It supports scratch cooking. It adopts industry best practices. It supports holiday and theme meals by including ingredients on the approved MLL and by seasonal management that supports unique menu requirements. It encourages development of food preparation skills while reducing unnecessary workload through t he implementation of scratch, s peed-sc ratch, and prepared cooking methods and recipes. It uses healthier coo king methods It s treamlines equipment standardized with Subsistence Prime Vendor (SPV) catalogs to increase inventory management. 2.MENU DESIGN. The TYCOM and Fleet representatives from the Culinary Specialist (CS) Community in collaboration with NAVSUP shall use all resources available including afloat unit Menu Review B oards when developing menus. Men u design shall consider the following: Nutritional requirements Food cost Acceptability Worldwide supportability CS skill sets Equipment Manning l evels Platform storage challenges 3.MENU. The TYCOM and/or NAVSUP shall draft a menu us ing the following tools: Cargo ( afloat) and SPV Catalog NAVSUPNOTE 7330 Crew preference surveys Armed For ces Recipe Service (AFRS)NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 3-7 Recipes in FSM that have been approved by r egion and/or NAVSUP. Ing redients and recipes for salad bars and dessert bars shall be included with the menu and must be coded accurately . CNIC Regional Directors shall develop menus using the resources listed above. 4.NSC M 1080 TEMPLATE. The menu template is a standard Excel spreadsheet used to populate Fleet cycle menu requirements . The template is located on the MY NAVSUP website under the Navy Food Services, NSCM G4G tab per platform . The template must be used for menu submission. The approved menu must compl y with NAVSUP P- 486, Go For Green\u00ae Program Menu Planning Guidelines , and DoD Publication 1338.10M (Department of Defense Food Service Instruction Manual) . The NA VSUP G4G FSM recipe coding resource shall be used to populate the menu template for breakfast, lunch, and dinner . Information shall i nclude the following: Recipe Name Recipe Number G4G code Sodium code Menu templ ates are populated according to the number of cycles specific to their platform or ashore galley . Menu cycles range from 21 days to 28 days depending on the platform . 5.DRAFT ING THE MENU . Most meals are planned around the center -of-the-plate entr\u00e9e of meat, fish, or poultry . Other meal components are selected to complement the main dishes . Additional menu drafting considerations are discussed below. a. Meat Block. A frequency chart for protein is known as a \"meat block.\" Its purpose is to optimally distribute beef, veal, pork, lamb, fish, poultry, and meat substitutes . Having a balanc e of meats and meat substitutes to provide variety is a key to forecasting cost and acceptability . Meat (protein) is the most expensive item on the menu . Balancing a menu with a combination of meat and alternate protein sources assists with predict ing menu requirements accurately . b. Menu Sequence. The following steps must be followed when drafting the major components of a meal : Step 1 - Entree Step 2 - Starches and vegetables Step 3 - Salads Step 4 - Breakfast fruits and cereals Step 5 - Desserts Step 6 - Breads and breakfast pastries Step 7 - Soups and beverages c.Menu Food Listing . Foods on the Cycle Menu or the posted menu at the head of the serving line must be listed in the following order (accompaniments to a menu item should be written alongside or directly underneath the menu item ): Breakfast Fruit Juices Cereals Main Entree Breakfast Pastry Breads -Butter Jam-Jelly Beverages Lunch or Dinner Soup- Crackers Main Entree Gravy or S auce (if required) Starches Vegetables Salad Dressings Breads and Butter Dessert and BeveragesNAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 3-86.A NALYZING THE DRAFT MENU. The FSO sha ll manage the TYCOM /NAVSUP developed NSCM to ensure that food supplies, equipment, and personnel are used optimally . If changes are necessary, the FSO shall review and note changes on the draft menu and return it to the LCS . The draft menu is used for preparing the daily Food Preparation Worksheet (NAVSUP Form 1090). 7.NSCM /RECIPE SUBMISSION DATES FOR AFLOAT . Afloat menu changes occur once a year in October . The effective day is on week 1 Monday cycle day 1. This date var ies for each platform based on platform menu cycle length (21 days to 28 days) . 8.NSCM COMMODITY/RECIPE CHANGES . Provides Commands with the opportunity to formulate and submit new recipe and ingredient changes to TYCOMs and/or CNIC . Requested changes must be submitted to NAVSUP via TYCOMs and/or CNIC and/or USFF in accordance with timelines published by NAVSUP. 9.NEW RE CIPE AND NEW INGREDIENT REQUEST PROCESS . This process allows Commands to submit new recipes and new ingredients through their TYCOM and/or CNIC . NAVSUP/ DoD Combat Feeding Directorate Combat Capabilities Development Command also will make ingredient and recipe suggestions for Fleet endorsement based on current food trends . The NAVSUP Readiness Officer shall forward an email to the TYCOM s and/or CNIC at the beginning of each calendar year , with a copy to Fleet Forces Command and PACFLT , requesting all new ingredients and recipes be submitted . Th is data will be accepted throughout the calendar year until 31 December . Comm ands will submit new ingredient and recipe requests through their TYCOM and/or CNIC . See Figure 3- 1 for a flowchart of the submission process . These requests will be considered for insertion into the Navy Standard Core Menu for the following year 's October menu release .

This process ensures that the ingredients in recipes are supported by an SPV . If there is no stock number for the requested new item, the Readiness Officer shall provide an alternate item that closely matches and request TYCOM and/or CNIC approval . If the recommended substitution is acceptable to TYCOM and/or CNIC, the item will be sent to DLA for a valid stock number . This process ensures that the ingredients in recipes are supported by an SPV. 13.CNIC I NGREDIENT AND RECIPE SUBMISSION QUOTA AND POLICY . CNIC HQ may submit a maximum of five new item requests per quarter for distribution to one or more CONUSregions for a total of 20 new item and/or recipe updates per year . The i ngr edient and recipe submission policy is as follows : All new item request requirements derive from MRB minutes that reflect end userpreferences for item changes . Customer surveys, feedback cards, and/or minutes documenting end user preference must accompany new item changes. End user preferences and/or feedback shall be broad in scope and shall not be based on the opinions of a few or confined to galley staff. New item requests must be a variation on an existing recipe or a new recipe submitted to the NAVSUP HQ functional mailbox using the approved recipe template. A request will be returned to the CNIC HQ if it does not include a manufacturer specification sheet and nutrition label attached to the Prime Vendor Local Stock Number Request Form 832 with the recipe submission. SPV contract s allow up to 30 days to source new (not cataloged) items . SPV contract s' monthly case minimum re quirements must be met. There will be a drawdown period for the depletion of existing items to be replaced with newingredients in regional Prime Vendor catalogs. CNIC HQ will identify an existing ingredient and/or recipe for removal for each new ingredient and/or recipe request, DoD Combat Feeding Directorate Combat Capabilities Development Command shallstandardize new recipes in the A FRS format. Following recipe completion at Natick, NAVSUP will enter each recipe into FSM and notify CNIC HQ that the recipe is available for use. All new ingredient/recipe requests must be submitted to the NAVSUP Food Service Mailbox, navsup_foodservice@navy.mil . Timelines will be specified by NAVSUP. The N avy Standard Core Menu must be adhered to as developed by the TYCOM/ NAVSUP/DoD Combat Feeding Directorate Combat Capabilities Development Command o r CNIC.

M anual entry on the 1090 is not required . See below for three guidelines for manually computing acceptabilities.* * Including tenant commands.NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 3-15 DISPO SITION OF LEFTOVER SECTION Comments/Disposition of Leftovers Prepared Comments by the Watch Captain on the disposition of all prepared leftovers. Unprepared Comments by the Watch Captain on the disposition of all unprepared food items . F or example, \"returned to bulk storeroom custodian\" . Addit ional Note for Leftovers: D onations of leftover food items that have been prepared or cooked are unauthorized. Cooked food that has not been consumed cannot be donated for the following reasons: All GM food stocks must be issued and served in fulfillment of the U.S . Title 10 ration entitlement , or they must be disposed of properly. The FSO is responsible for food -borne illness resulting from improper or careless preparation, serving , or storage of food. The FSO, with assistance from the galley staff , must ensure that all food items prepared are consumed in the designated dining areas. The safety and quality of food prepared, served, and saved as leftovers during the assigned watch is the direct responsibility of the Watch Captain who must also ensure that food is prepared to minimize leftovers and waste. Donating food is a noble gesture, but is in violation of NAVSUP policy and of U.S. Code Title 10 . In the unlikely event that any donated food was unfit for consumption, the Navy could face liability because proper procedures were not followed. Leftovers must never be considered as a bulk food donation to the local Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO) . * Three g uidelines for manually computing acceptability are presented below . The first method is use d when t he food i tem pr epared does not r un out . Subtract the number o f portions l eft ov er from t he number o f portions pr epared to determine the number of portions served. Then divi de this number (t he number of portions served) by the number o f persons fed. EXAMPLE: 190 portions pr epared 3 portions l eft ov er 170 persons f ed 190-3 = 187 number of portions serv ed 187/170 = 110% The seco nd method is used when the menu item pr epared runs ou t and an additional amount of the same food item is prepared . Add t he number of original portions prepared to the number o f additional por tions p repared . Subtract t he nu mber o f portions l eft ov er to determine the nu mber o f portions se rved. Then d ivide the number o f portions se rved by t he number or per sons fed. EXAMPLE: 160 original por tions pr epared 30 addi tional por tions p repared 170 persons f ed 3 portions l eft ov er 160+30-3 = 187 number of portions serv ed 187/170 = 110% 3 -16NAVSU P P-486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Servi ce Management The third m ethod i s use d when the menu i tem pr epared r uns ou t and i s substituted w ith an alternate f ood item . The substitute food item must equal or ex ceed the acceptability of the item r eplaced . Annotate the time the original menu item r an out, t he head count a t that time, and t he name of t he alternate f ood item . Divide the number o f original por tions prepared by t he number of persons se rved up to t he tim e the or iginal food i tem r an out . EXAMPLE: 160 original por tions pr epared 150 persons served up to the time the original food item ran out 160/150 = 107% 4.REQUIRED SIGNATURES.

NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 3-183004 SUGGESTIONS FOR THE FOOD SERVICE OFFICER 1.GENERAL . Each GM must e stablish procedures for handling suggestions for the F SO. This program provides the best possible service to GM customers . A local form shall be developed to implement the suggestion program . See Figure 3 -4 for the suggested format . 2.PRO CEDURE . Suggestion box programs will comply with the following requirements : Boxes will b e readily available and clearly identified. Boxes will h ave a penci l or pen readily available. Boxes will h ave an ample supply of locally prepared suggestion forms . Boxes may be an electronic FSO suggestion box ( highly recommended ). Boxes shall be emptied and/or reviewed daily . The FSO shall review each suggestion fo r possible adoption and implementation. The FSO shall ensure that a reply is be made within 48 hours when a name and address is supplied. The FSO shall ensure that suggestions that may apply to other GMs will be submitted to NAVSUP . (Sample form) To: Food Service Officer (date) ___________ I suggest consideration be given to: ____________________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________ Food Service Officer Figure 3 -4 Suggestions for the Food Service Officer NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 3-19 PART B: CONSERVATION URES 1.GENERAL . Operation of the GM requires economy and food conservation. Essential parts of an efficient and economical operation include food conservation and waste elimination. Proper use of NAVSUP Form 1090 provides GMs with the best available management control for food conservation. 2.CONTROL LING TRAY WASTE . Monitoring the serving line during meal service may not be sufficient to control tray waste. The LCS shall use various tools (such as proper portion control, Command food surveys , and effective MRBs ) to reduce waste. Tray waste can be considerably eliminated when proper predictions are made and when recipe cards are followed. Proper portion control while monitoring the serving line during the meal is essential . A departmental policy of serving second portions must be developed and publicized . Offering second portions rather than overloading the tray and/or plate the first time through the line assist s in controlling tray waste. 3.CONTROL LING AND REDUCING FOOD WASTE . Food waste is a common problem throughout the food service industry . One of the first lines of defense is to reduce food spoilage . Food needs to be checked aggressively at the \"back door\" by taking time to properly inspect the food on the pier . There are many ways to check the quality and freshness of incoming stores without spending too much extra time on the task . Helpful hints for controlling and reducing food waste are discussed below . Check pac kaging when food is delivered to ensure that packaging has maintained its integrity and that boxes are not damaged or wet . Problems with packaging usually result in food damage . Damaged packaging must be returned to the Prime Vendor and replaced . Document all packaging discrepancies on the Report of Discrepancy (SF Form 364) and submit the Report to TYCOM/NFMT. Time and t emperature abuse is an issue that frequently causes major food shortages if not caught on the pier . Ensure that refrigerated and frozen foods are stored as quickly as possible. Check product shelf life . Eliminat e or reduce unnecessary handling . Taking care of food before it gets to the galley maximizes quality and yield and reduces waste . The following list provides more ways to reduce food waste: Use the first-i n first-o ut (FIFO) system for inventory rotation. Walk t hroug h all primary provision spaces daily. Look inside all produce boxes for evidence of deterioration. Alert the LCS about products that will not last more than a few days so that the products can be placed in the rotation. Refer to Chapter 1 for temperature monitoring requirements for bulk storage and for chill and freeze spaces. Walk through th e galley's chill space at the beginning and end of each shift to en sure proper rotation, storage procedures, and leftover usability. Prepare vegetables and fruit by carefully removing inedible peelings with little or no edible flesh thrown away . Avoid peeling potatoes; the skin is edible and full of fiber. Aggressively use progressive cooking techniques, especially toward the end of a meal period. Leftovers may be incorporated into the daily meal; turned into soup; or added to soups, salads, or casserole dishes. The Tri Service Food Code/NAVMED P-5010-1 for the use of leftovers must be strictly adhered to. Leftovers must never be donated or transferred off the ship or submarine for further consumption. Leftovers must be properly disposed of after use and after their shelf life has expired.NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 3-20PART C: MENU SUPPORT PROGRAM S 3200 M YPLATE 1.UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE MYPLATE. The MyPlate program encourages consumers to fill half of their plate with fruits and vegetables, one- fourth with whole grains, and one -fourth with lean protein. MyP late communicates easy -to-understand messages to support the 2015- 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans . MyPlate reminds individuals and families to adopt healthier lifestyles as America continues the fight against obesity . Suggestions include the following : Balancing calories: enjoy your food, but eat less . Foods to choose : make half of your plate fruits and vegetables, make one fourth of your plate grains emphasizing whole grains, and switch to fat -free or low -fat (1 percent) milk . Foods to reduce: soup, white bread, frozen meals, and sugary drinks. 3201 J OINT SUBSISTENCE POLICY BOARD 1.DOD 1338.10 MENU STANDARDS . The DoD menu standards are the minimum practical guidelines that military food service programs must use during menu planning, food procurement, food preparation, and meal service to support the required nutrition standards . The DoD Food and Nutrition Committee monitor s, updates , and provides implementation guidance on DoD Menu Standards to the Joint Subsistence Policy Board (JSPB) as additional scientific information on nutrient requirements become available. The DoD Menu Standards ar e reviewed at least every 3 years, and any subsequent updat es are reported in the minutes of the JSPB and published on the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support website:https://www.dla.mil/TroopSupport/Subsistence/DoingBusinesswithSub/ 2.SERVIC E IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE. The Services must assess the \"when available\" exceptions to global product availability to ensure that ordering practices comply with standards . Exceptions for Navy Afloat are indicated by an asterisk (*) in the JSPB DoD Menu Standards . These exceptions are authorized only when there is limited storage onboard ships and when resupply of ships at sea in different ports may limit access to all DoD Menu Standards required items . 3.DoD ME NU STANDARDS . The DoD Menu Standards provide minimum guidelines for personnel to use when planning menus . The following list contains key points from these standards : Fruits and Fruit Juices . Must have two or more fresh fruit choices per meal. Vegetables . Must offer a minimum of two hot vegetables per meal with at least one non-starchy vegetable. Salad Bar . Must include leafy greens with a minimum of seven vegetables of varied colors and must offer low fat salad dressings . Small platforms may offer less when they are subject to spe cial constraints. Grains and Starches . Must have whole grain and /or whole wheat varieties of bread and pasta and must include low fat or low calorie alternatives. Meats and Entrees . Must offer a lean cut of meat served without added fats. Dairy . All milk products must be one percent or nonfat and must be fortified with vitamins A and D; dairy choices must be low fat or reduced fat . Fats and Oils . Must use trans -fat free products appropriate to the cooking technique. Sodium . All pre -prepared entrees must contain fewer than 6 00 milligrams of sodium per serving . This i s equivalent to 1/3 teaspoon and it equals 33 percent of the NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 3-21 Recommended Daily Value. Lower sodium alternatives must always be offered. Beverages . Milk, water, and low calorie beverages containing fewer than 40 calories per serving must be offered at eac h meal. Condiments . Low sodium, low fat, and sugar free options must be available for each meal . Soups . One soup at lunch or dinner must be a broth or vegetarian soup. Low or reduced sodium soups that contain fewer than 8 00 milligrams of sodium per 8- ounce serving must be provided. This amount of sodium is equivalent to 1/4 teaspoon and it equals 25 percent of the Recommended Daily Value. Desserts . Fresh fruit and a trans -fat-free dessert option always must be available on all dessert bars. 3202 GO FOR GREEN \u00ae 1.GENERAL . The goal of this program is to encourage healthy food and beverage selections to support the performance, recovery, and health of Sailors . G4G Navy menus make nutrient -rich choices more visible through choice architecture at the serving line and must offer green -coded options at each meal . Menu choices are prominently display ed with green -coded items first on the serving line, followed by yellow -coded items, and then red- coded items . The menu offerings and food items are labeled green (eat often), yellow (eat occasionally), and red (eat rarely) based on the impact the food may have on a service member's health status . Classification of foods is based on percentage of calories from tot al fat, percentage of calories from saturated fat, type of sugar, amount of fiber, and degree of processing. A sodium code of low, moderate or high isprovided independent of the color code . The criteria are based on recommendations of the American Heart Association; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; Health and Human Services ( HHS ); U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ); and the National Institutes of Health. 2.GO F OR GREEN\u00ae COMPLIANC E POLICY . Commands must comply with the G4G Program as stated in NAVADMIN 178/15 and ALNAV Message 050/15. The criteria discussed below are mandatory for galleys to be considered satisfactorily compliant. The G 4G menu in the Food Service Management (FSM) system shall be used by all C ommands per platform at the beginning of the cycle each October . Recipes used must match the G4G color - coded menu (NAVSUP Form 1080 ). All food items offered in the galley must have food label cards displayed as described on the MY NAVSUP website path Sites>Navy Food Service> Documents , in folder Navy G4G 2.0 Resources and 1080s, Excel document NAVSUP FSM G4G 2.0 Recipe Coding .

The following must be considered when determining the extent and types of food to be procured: nature of the duty procurement item availability in the Master Load List ( MLL) prescribed endurance levels shelf life storage capability Food shall be stored so that the oldest stocks will be used first . Replenishing perishable foods requires consider ing the availability and efficiency of refrigeration . Generally, only frozen meats, fish, and poultry are requisitioned. Chilled meats, seafood, and poultry items should be procured in limited quantities and handled in accordance with good commercial practice . These products must be used and stored in accordance with NAVMED P-5010-1 , Tri- Service Food Code. They must be imprinted with a \"use by date\" when received, and they must be consumed by this date. In hot weather , it is advisable to receive perishables in the early morning or after nightfall . In freezing weather or very hot weather fresh fruits and vegetables must be handled with extra care to prevent freezing or spoilage . Canned meats , canned fruits, and vegetables shall be stocked in sufficient quantities to supplement their fresh/frozen counterpart or to be used as a total substitute when necessary. 4001 S TOCKAGE OBJECT IVE A monthly supply demand review will be made of all Subsistence Ledgers (NAVSUP Form 335) to maintain the current in- stock position for all items with a recurring demand and to keep inventories within the prescribed limitations . The maximum in- stock positi on for semi -perishable food is the high limit that is established by the Fleet or Type Commander . The maximum in- stock position of perishable foods is the quantity consumed times the storage life of that item based on the individual shelf life of the food products . Non -CARGO (Consolidated Afloat Requisitioning Guide Overseas) foods , such as spices, must be stocked to last for the duration of the deployment . When the monthly review indicates that food items exceed their high limit, menu changes shall be initiated in time to provide for consumption of the food before it deteriorates . See Paragraph 4003 below for establishing high and low limits. 4002 I NVENTORY LEVELS ASHORE Ashore inventory levels will maintain a maximum of 7 to 10 days endurance level on- hand except in emergency feeding situations that warrant a higher level. Inventory levels are determined by taking that value of the total current on- hand inventory and dividing that number by the last 30 days ' average daily food cost (taking into account that high value items in support of the menu such as beverages, condiments, and spices may need to be removed for a more accurate endurance level) . This is not an exact measurement because of fluctuations in the NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 4-3daily menu cost (such as for the cost of special meals and holiday meals), but the sample base of 30 days allows for corrections for special circumstances. 4003 EST ABLISHING HIGH AND LOW LIMITS 1.GENERAL . A low limit and a high limit must be established for each item of stock at least quarterly . Low limits and high limits shall be adjusted based on the following reasons: Increases or decreases in crew size. Anticipated operations . Changes in crew preferences . Changes in the menu. Any other factors affecting the consumption of the items being ordered . 2.LOW LI MIT. The low limit is the stock position that signals the need to begin replenishment action. The number of days endurance required for the low limit will be established by the Fleet or Type Commander . There will be no low limit for perishable chill foods except when that item has a storage life greater than the high limit number of days endurance established by the Fleet or Type Commander . Use the following formula to compute the low limit for food items: The total quantity co nsumed during the pr evious three one- month acco unting periods (Less surveys and transfers) Divided by ( \u00f7) the number o f day s in the previous t hree one -month acco unting periods (usually 90 days) Equals (=) Daily Usage (round to hundredth decimal, ex. 9.23) Multiplied by (x) the number of day s enduranc e for the low limit (as es tablished by the Fl eet or Ty pe Co mmander) Equals (=) the low limit (round up to nearest whole number) 3.HIGH LIMIT . The high limit is the maximum quantity of food to be maintained on hand to sustain current operations . The number of days endurance required for the high limit will be established by the Fleet or Type Commander . The high limit for perishable chill foods will not exceed the storage life. Use the following formula t o compute the high limit for food items: The total q uantity co nsumed three one-month acco Divided by ( \u00f7) the number o f days i n the pr evious t hree one- month a ccounting pe riods (usually 90 days) Equals (=) Daily Usage (round to hundredth decimal, ex. 9.23) Multiplied by (x) the number of days endurance for the high limit (as established by the Fleet or Ty pe Co mmander) Equals (=) the high limit (round up to nearest whole number) 4.ORDERING AND SHIPPING TIME ADJUSTMENT. Ordering and shipping time adjustment is the time between submission of a requisition or purchase order and receipt of the material. Use the following formula to compute the ordering and shipping time adjustment: The total quantity co nsumed during the pr evious three one-month acco unting periods (Less surveys and transfers) Divided by ( \u00f7) the number o f days i n the pr evious t hree one- month a ccounting pe riods (usually 90 days) Multiplied b y (x) the appl icable ordering and shipping time Equals ( =) the ordering a nd shipping time 4-4NAVSUP P-4 86, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management NOTE: Th e quantity to be ordered must be rounded to whole case lots. FSM 3 does not calculate requisitions in this format; therefore, you must use another tool to establish the replenishment action (quantity to be ordered) such as Microsoft Excel or other program. 4005 SUBSISTENCE ENDURANCE LEVELS Subsistence replenishments for a ship underway are based on the Operation Orders (OPORDs) referenced in OPNAVINST 4442.1H. The endurance goals reflect the stockage objectives (that is, the sum of the operating and safety levels of stock) that represent the desired quantity of material (in days of supply) that each platform type should be capable of storing onboard to sustain operations. Minus (-) the quantity on order Plus (+) the quantity required to cover the order and shipping time adjustment Equals (=) the quantity to be ordered (round to nearest whole number)The quantity to order of any item will be determined during the monthly supply demand review using the following formula: The high limit for the item Minus ( -) the on -hand balance recorded on NAVSUP Form 335 NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 4-5PART B: REQUISITIONING REGULATIONS 4100 SUBSI STENCE . The Subsistence Prime Vendor (SPV) program is a result of the Department of Defense (D oD) Food Inventory demonstration project . The demonstration proved the viability of using commercial vendors to provide subsistence requirements with in the Continental United States (CONUS) . Under congressional mandate, the DoD Joint Task Group that was assigned to implement this project approved a deployment plan for all DoD activities . Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Subsistence administers the Prime Vendor (PV) indefinite quantity contracts that provide Class I support . Contracts are awarded for a base year with multiple year options . The contracts guarantee minimum and maximum purchases . Deviations are allowable in the event of emergencies and mobilization. The SPV program uses a single, full -line commercial food distributor that delivers subsistence products directly to the galley . Orders are submitted via electronic commerce methods . SPV contracts are tailored to meet the needs of the Fleet by providing high quality products while reducing the distribution and warehousing costs of the DoD at all levels. 2.OPERATI ON. Food items offered to naval galleys by the SPV must be of the same quality and variety offered to commercial and institutional facilities . The SPV will support the Fleet with the following food categories: Chilled products Frozen fish, meat, and poultry Semi- perishable food items ( such as canned foods, condiments, sauces, seasonings, spices, fats, oils, confectionery, nuts, and sugars) Frozen foods such as fruits, vegetables, and pastries Fresh fruits, vegetables, bread, and dairy items are provided by the PV through DLA market ready contracts The PV must stock items in sufficient quantities to fill all ordering requirements. Items ordered will be delivered by the stipulated time after transmitting the order. Contact the local NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center (NAVSUP FLC) for specific SPV lead-times. When longer lead times are required, coordination between the ship and the local NAVSUP FLC is required. Requests requiring a shorter lead time is considered EMERGENT on which the requesting command will incur additional costs issued by the vendors, and must have Type Commander (TYCOM) approval. 3.REQUIREMENTS. The following required elements are used to place an SPV order for delivery: The Food Service Management (FSM) System Subsistence Total Order Receipt and Electronic System (STORES) Fleet Lo gistics Center (N AVSUP FLC) Printer Electronic Transmission via E-m ail 4.NAVSUP SUPPORT. NAVSUP N432 administers the SPV program for Naval afloat and ashore activities. NAVSUP N432 ensures that all support issues are resolved expeditiously with DLA, Direct Support Operations (DSO), and NAVSUP FLCs the SPVs, NAVSUP N432 chairs TYCOM Working Group Meetings that address all SPV issues, and ensures that modifications to the SPV program are implemented efficiently. Afloat activities must submit any SPV support concerns that cannot be resolved by the NAVSUP FLC point of contact to N AVSUP N432 via TYCOM. Ashore activities must submit concerns that cannot beNAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 4-6resolved by their SPV to NAVSUP HQ via the Regional Manager/FSO . Ashore and/or afloat Commands must not, under any circumstances , contact the account manager at DLA or the SPV for support and sustainment related concerns . These situations must be routed through the proper C hain of C ommand to the NAVSUP Readiness Officer for action. NAVSUP HQ pr ovides a quarterly compliance document to DLA-TS that includes beneficial information relat ed to SPV specific stock numbers, not in stock (NIS) items, and subsistence items that SPV is required to source . The compliance document contains UNCLAS -Proprietary Information and shall not be released to non -government entities including the SPV. 5.DEFENSE LOGISTICS AGENCY TROOP SUPPORT. DLA will prepare, award, and administer contracts for direct delivery of subsistence to ashore and afloat GMS. Contracts w ill provide for required delivery service, packaging/labeling requirements, and the quality of service required to be provided by the vendor. DLA shall provide and maintain the maximum level of support required to enable success. DLA is respo nsible for providing STORES catalogs to NAVSUP. New catalogs will be available weekly for customer use. The local Navy Food Management Team may be contacted for further assistance. The DLA Subsistence Home Page can be found at https://www.dla.mil/TroopSupport/subsistence/Food Services. 6.FLEET LOGISTICS CENTER. The Fleet Logistics Center (FLC) serves as the afloat unit point of contact for all subsistence requirements under the SPV program. Afloat units will not contact their local SPV directly. All subsistence issues must be resolved by the FLC point of contact. The FLC will track all subsistence requirements from receipt of order to time of deliver including coordinating with DLA to revise the SPV catalog in response to Fleet input. The SPV program support activities that FLC provides to afloat units are discussed below. a.Process Orders . The following steps shall be taken to process orders: Receive a Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP) formatted requisiti on from FSM via email or hard-copy message. Input ship requirement into STORES. b.Coordinate Purchase of Substitutions. The following steps shall be taken to coordinate purchase of substitutions: Contact ships to review Not in Stock (NIS) listings from the SP V when seeking resolution. NIS items may not be substituted for subsistence items having a different FIC. MILSTRIPs may not be modified, edited, or changed after the initial order is submitted to the SPV. See Figure 4-1 . Procure local items and initiate any open purchase requirements if the SPV cannot provide item upon approval from TYCOM and Bureau of Naval Personnel N10 (BUPERS). c.Send STORES-S ent Order Reports to the Sh ips. Notify ships of locally procured items, NIS items , substitutions, and cancellations. d.Process Receipts. The following steps must be taken for receipt processing: Receive annotated receipt doc uments from vendor Enter receipt data into STORES Send the STORES Ex ported Re ceipt file to the ship electronically within 24 to 72 hours (ships must check the quantity they have posted in the FSM System against the receipt file ).NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 4-7 e. Ships . Ships investigate the difference between the invoice posted in the FSM System and the uploaded STORES -Exported Receipt file provided by NAVSUP FLC as shown in FSM Receipt quantity/price fields . If there is an input error in receipt entries, modify the receipt in FSM . Attach a copy of the STORES receipt data to the vendor's invoice. If it is an entry error from FLC , ensure that FLC is notified immediately of any quantity or price discrepancies . Figure 4-1 MILSTRIP Breakdown NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 4-87.ORDERING PROCEDURES. Afloat units must refer to the NAVSUP FLC Provisions Ordering Procedures. Ashor e activities must refer to the SPV contract for unique ordering procedures . Orders are processed using the FSM system and STORES. Commands must use the proper Purchase Ration Factor (PRF) or Catch Weight Multiple (CWM) when processing orders in the FSM system. The P RF is the number of it ems in each case. For example, when ordering #10 (#10 is the size) cans of Green Beans 6/case, the PRF is 6. 8.SUBSISTENCE PROCUREMENT SECURITY. All subsistence products should be purchased from an approved source of supply as stated in NAVSUP Instruction 4355.10, AR 40-657, and USAPHC Directory of Sanitarily Approved Food Establishments for Armed Forces Procurement . DLA also provides assistance on the DLA Subsistence Home Page in the \"Directory\", \"Regional Prime Vendor s\", and \" Security Checklist \" sections . The military's food service experts are the first line of defense in ensuring the safety of food products served to the U.S . military . When receiving products from PVs or produce suppliers, military personnel must demonstrate a high level of surveillance to ensure the product s are safe for consumption by adhering to the guidelines discussed below. a.Approved Sources . Products must be purchased from an approved source such as those listed in the Worldwide Directory Of Sanitarily Approved Food Establishments For Armed Forces Procurement and in the DLA Direct orate of Subsistence (http://phc.amedd.army.mil/topics/foodwater/ca/Pages/DoDApprovedFoodSources.aspx ) DoD Veterinary Services Activity and Public Health Command (PHC ) have the responsibilit y for maintaining the Directory of approved food sources for Department of Defense procurement . The Directory establishes the CONUS and Outside CONUS (OCONUS ) industrial base of approved food vendors that meet U .S. public health standards and international good manufacturing processes. The list of vendors forms the basis for the DLA Subsistence Prime Vendor (SPV) program and is the first vital step for providing food safety, security , and defense of the DoD food chain. To be approved for listing as a supply vendor, establishments must pass inspection by the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) Food Safety Inspection Service, other established Federal Agencies, or the U. S. Military Veterinary Service. The vendor also must meet the standards of the current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Food Code. b.Delivery Organizations and Personnel . Familiarity with delivery organizations and personnel must be established. P roper identification must be requested if any such organizations and personnel are unfamiliar . c.U.S. Army Veterinary Inspectors Review . Refer all unfamiliar brands or boxes not properly marked to the U.S . Army Veterinary Inspectors for further review. d.Adulterated Products or Products That Have Been Tampered With. Segregate and place on hold for further review by the U.S . Army Veterinary Service any product that appears to be adulterated or tampered with. All cases of such adulteration or tampering must be reported. Food safety procedures should be reviewed to ensure all subsistence items are safely stored upon receipt . Storage spaces must be adequately secured and monitored. A ccess to food supplies must be limited to the appropriate personnel only . Any indication of food- borne illness must be immediately reported to the U.S . Army Veterinary Service and to the local Navy Preventive Medicine Authority (PMA) . The above procedures apply to normal SPV deliveries . Any subsistence procured via Husbanding Service s in foreign ports requires an increased level of security awareness . Any questions or concerns sh all be addressed to the NAVSUP Staff Veterinary Officer . NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 4-99.VALIDATION OF SUBSISTENCE TOTAL ORDER AND RECEIPT ELECTRONIC SYSTEM (STORES). To properly generate an order from STORES, commands must ensure that their STORES profile is correct. The following STORES profile items must be checked periodic ally: Ashore activities must validate the profile set up in STORES to ensure its accuracy. Ashore activities that have changed their UIC/DODA AC need to update STORES with the new UIC. Ashore and afloat units must validate the profile set up with their STORES Account Manager to ensure they have the correc t UIC/DOCAAC, fund code, and s ervic e designator (V, R, N). Th e following c odes must be cited on DD Form 1348 (DoD Single Line Item Requisition) or on other substitute requisition forms that require fund codes for requisitioning subs istence items from regular supply support activities such as FLC, Combat Logistics Forces (CLFs), and Navy Stock Fund activities: oAFLOAT (Service Code R - PACFLT or V - LANTFLT)PZ - Subsistence provis ions (includes operational rations ) oASHORE (Service Code N - CONUS or OCONUS)PZ - Subs istence provisions (includes operational rations ) oActivities with branch messes must only order provisions under their assigned UIC. The UIC (requisitioner) on DD Form 1348 must be correctly entered in Card Column 31 through Card Column 35. All efforts must be made to correctly enter the UIC on other substitute requisitions. NOTE: The UIC \"N00022\" (the UIC to be billed not N32199) o n DD Form 1348 must be correctly entered in Card Column 45 through Card Column 50 with a signal code of \"B\" in Card Column 51. This will ensure that the food purchases will be charged to the Subsistence In Kind (SIK) line of accounting. 10.ORDER CANCELLATION PROCESSING . SIK order cancellation processing must be followed as discussed below to ensure proper transaction recording in the FSM system ; STORES; and in the Standard Accounting, Budgeting and Reporting System (SABRS). a.Order Cancelled in FSM, Not Transmitted for Fulfillment . This situation requires the following actions: If an unapproved SIK order created in the FSM system requires cancellation, the order must be deleted : click on \"Delete Order\" under \"Manage Orders \" If an SIK order that is created and approved in the FSM system , but is not released to any source (FLC Operator, Chief Logistics Officer ( CLO), CLF, Commander Task Force ( CTF), or DL A Troop Support) , requires cancellation, the order must be cancelled in the FSM system : click on \"Cancel Order\" under \"Manage Orders \". b.SIK Order Not Released to PV/Cancellation. This situation requires the following actions:If an SIK order that is appr oved in the FSM system and released for fulfillment requires cancellation, the Ordering Unit must contact STORES personnel (FLC Operator, CLO, CLF, CTF, or DLA Troop Support) and oStores Personnel (FLC Operator, CLO, CLF, CTF, or DLA Troop Support) . Confirm the order has not been processed in STORES and has not been released to the vendor . Provide written notification (may be via email) of order cancellation to the ordering unit. oOrdering Unit . Upon receipt of written confir mation ( may be via email) from STORES personnel that the order has not been entered into STORES ,NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 4-10cancellations may be processed in the FSM system as follows: Under \"Manage Receive \" click on \" RDD by , \"Receive Edit \" page, and \"Cancel Order\". oCLO/CLF Ship. For SIK order trans actions that are pre-s creened by the CLO for CLF processing, confirm cancellation with the CLF ship and provide written notification (may be via email) of c ancellation to the ordering unit. oOrdering Unit . Upon receipt of written confirmation (may be via email) from the CLO/CLF ship that the order has been cancelled, cancellations shall be processed in the FSM system as follows: Under \"Manage Receive\" click CTF, or DLA Troop Support). If the order has been entered into STORES, STORES pe rsonnel must submit an order cancellation request to the vendor. If the vendor confirms order cancellation, the order must be canceled in STORES as follows: set the \"DLA Quantity\" received on the STORES \"R eceipt Details\" screen to zero and select the \"reason description \" from the \"S hort Shipment Reason\" drop-down menu. oOrdering Unit. Upon receipt of written confirmed cancellation from STORES personnel, modify the quantity received for each cancelled line item on the order in the FSM system on the \"M anage Receive\" and \"M in the \"Q uantity Received\" field or process the automated STORES \"Receipt File\" in the FSM system. NOTE: If cancellation confirmation cannot be obtained from the vendor and is not provided to the ordering unit by STORES personnel, the cancellation request is denied and the order is v alid for fulfillment. oOrdering Unit: Upon processing of a cancellation in the FSM system, an email notification must be submitted to BUPERS lis ting all document numbers that have been cancelled with supporting documentation required for de-o bligation. 4101 FOOD ITEMS PROCURE D FROM OTHE R THAN A SUBSISTENC E PRIM E VENDOR 1.GENERAL .

It applies to initial acquisition of equipment and to renewal or extension of existing equipment leases. Contractor-f urnished dispensers must meet the sanitation standards of the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) or other agencies with an equivalent testing program recognized by the Surgeon General. 4.CONTAINERS. Ashore activities in the United States will be supplied with bulk milk in plastic di sposable containers or plastic reusable crates, depending on which is more economical. Plastic reusable crates are authorized for ashore activities only, are for reuse by the contractor only, and will not be reused by the GM for any purpose. Bulk milk will be supplied only i n plastic disposable containers to shore activities in Hawaii, OCONUS, and to all GMs afloat. Activities equipped with Navy-owned, refrigerated bulk milk dispensers may use Navy- owned, stainless steel milk containers for preparing and dispensing cold non-m ilk bev erages, reconstituted milk, and sterile whole milk from the dispenser cabinet. Plastic disposable containers shall be destroyed in accordance with Project Prime (Plastics Removal in Marine Environment) a fter they have been emptied of the original contents. 5.LIQUID BEVERAGE BASES AND BEVERAGE DISPENSERS. Carbonated and non- carbonated liquid beverage bases and associated dispensing equipment are authorized for use in GMs . Authorized liquid beverages (syrup) are listed in the local Prime Vendor Catalog and may be obtained through normal sources of supply. Individual cans /bottles of carbonated and non-c arbonat ed beverages, as listed in local Prime Vendor Catalogs, are authorized for use only w here beverage dispensers are not available (for example, in areas such as fantail cookouts, box lunches, or flight meals). Individual c ans/bottles of carbonated/non-c arbonated beverages are not authorized for use on the serving line in GMs. Individual-sized containers o f beverages trans ferred from a ship's store to the galley may be consumed during a scheduled Commanding O fficers ship's event.

This i ncludes the purchase of ice when ice making facilities are inoperative or are not available and there are requirements for ice for us e in the enlisted dining facility and for the cooling of drinking water. Be verage dispensing service equipment, including carbon dioxide (CO2), will be billed separately from food and drink items.NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 4-124102 SOURCES OF SU BSISTENCE 1.REGULAR SOURCES . Authorized food items on the NSCM may be obtained from the nearest SPV/STORES, CLF ships, or other a float/ ashore activities . These sources of supply are expected to stock a complete range and level of food items to support operations . Afloat and ashore activities experiencing difficulties with obtaining adequate support for food items (frequent substitutions or NIS problems) shall contact the nearest servicing NAVSUP FLC for resolut ion; activities will not contact their local PV directly . All food orders must include NSCM PV catalog items . Unresolved SPV issues , such as deliveries below the contracted fill rates , shall be reported to NAVSUP N432 via TYCOM/CNIC for appropriate resolution. It is the TYCOM/CNIC's responsibility to ensure that requisitions are compliant with the NSCM . NAVSUP will randomly spot check receipts with charge data on a monthly basis to identify unauthorized purchases and to provide feedback to TYCOM/CNIC. Lis ts of Approved Sources may be obtained from the Veterinary Services web page at http://vets.amedd.army.mil/86256F90007C2D1D/PHC and from the DLA Subsistence home web page at http://phc.amedd.army.mil/topics/foodwater/ca/Pages/DoDApprovedFoodSources.aspx . Reg ional assistance may be obtained from Food Management Team s or from the following resource sites: DLA Directorate of Directory of Sanitarily Approved Food Establishments for Armed ForcesProcurement Navy and Marine Corps Public Health Center: COM 757- 953-0702, http://www.nmcphc.med.navy.mil Req uisitions shall be based on TYCOM's and/or FLC 's operational demand, on- hand inventory, storage capacity, and product shelf life. All requisitions shall be generated from the FSM system . Items ordered shall be delivered by the SPV in the requir ed time after order receipt . Major underway deployments or load out requisitions require coordination between the ship and the FLC when there is the possibility of longer lead times . The SPV is the required purchasing source . Orders/purchases in FSM/STORES are systematically obligated; therefore no copies of requisitions are required by BUPERS. 2.OT HER SOURCES . Strict audit readiness compliance must be adhered to and only food items on the MLL are authorized for purchase . When authorized food items cannot be obtained through established supply channels, such as the preferred method of using an SPV, approval from the applicable TYCOM/Fleet is required. Deployed units must direct their subsistencerequirements to the appropriate NAVSUP FLC for procurement via TYCOM . Other sources of subsistence may apply to purchasing Operational Rations via DLA and to purchasing individual serving size products from the Ship's Store. Wh en submitting DD Form 1149 for purchas ing subsistence, the following information is required to be placed in B lock 2 of the Form: Location (city and country ) where subsistence i s being procured . Supporting FLC name and address . Type of subsistence (such as dairy, fruits, vegetables, and meats) . Contract number , when available.NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 4-133.LOCAL PURCHASE CONUS . Afloat and a shore galleys CONUS and OCONUS . The following conditions must be met for l ocal purchases t o be authorized: When there is an immediate and urgent mission -essential requirement for authorized food items to support the Navy Standard Core Menu. Follow guidelines for emergency requisitioning of subsistence in Section 4102.4d . When authorized food items cannot be obtained through established supply channels using the SPV (preferred method). When t ime is a factor and scheduled operations will not permit procurement through shore- based purchasing activities . See the DLA TROOP SUPPORT Ordering Guide or for additional information at https://www.dla.mil/TroopSupport . When there are r eceptions that are funded privately or through the Official Representation Fund (ORF) SECNAVINST 7 042.7k. Additi onal guidance is discussed below. a.Purchases from Ap proved So urces. All food products shall be purchased only from approved sources of supply as stated in NAVSUP Instruction 4355.4H and 4355.10, USAEUR Circular 40-6 57, and USAPHC Circular 40-1 Worldwide Directory of Sanitarily Approved Food Establishments for Armed Forces Procurement. In today's global conflict, fo od safety and fo od de fense ensure protection from intentional c riminal actions and from traditional public health concerns. T he military's food service experts are the first line of defense in ensuring the safety of food products served to the U.S. mi litary. When receiving products from PVs or Husbanding Services, military personnel must demonstrate a high level of surveillance to ensur e the products are safe for consumption by adhering to the following guidelines: Products shall be purchased from an approved source. Become familiar with delivery organizations and personnel. Request proper identification if any such organizations and personnel are unfamiliar. Refer all unfamiliar brands or boxes not properly marked to the U.S. Army Veterinary Inspectors for further review. Segregate and place on hold for further review by the U.S. Army Veterinary Service any product that appears to be adulterated or tampered with. All cases of such adulteration or tampering must be reported. b.Requisition Routing Sheet. The Requisition Routing Sheet shall be used with all DD Form 1149s generated for open purchases usi ng the local FLC outside the preferred PV method, for placing Operational Ration (OPRAT) requisitions to Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), and for Ship's Store purchases. To prevent unauthorized commitments, all orders outside the PV must be obligated by BUPERS first, before the command can process the order with the FLC or D LA or to the Ship's Store. c.Processing Requisitions. The following steps shall be followed for processing requisitions: All local purchases are subject to monitoring to ensure that all subsistence items procured are in support of the ML L . Requisitions will not be approved for catered meals from commercial sources such as restaurants or fast fo od es tablishments. Purchasing specialty items in support of holiday/special meals will require justification (an email and the DD Form 1149). DD Form 1149s must be generated in the FSM system and the DD Form 1149 must list the following items to ensure that the contract can be executed when the \"actual\" cost is known : oa valid requisition number oline of accounting orequired delivery dateNAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 4-14oquantities obest estimate of price The DD Form 1149 must accurately state the proper delivery address (the FSM system prefills with the mailing address). DD Form 1149s must be approved by TYCOM or a designated representative before BUPERS obligation (a minimum of 7 days in advance of the RDD). A requisition routing sheet must be prepared. See Appendix B for an example sheet. Th e DD Form 1149 and the requisition routing sheet shall be forwarded to TYCOM, Region , NSSC, and ISIC for review and adherence to policy . All or ders must show the list of items to be purchased and the total estimated cost. TYCOM/Region will forward DD Form 1149 and the requisition routing sheet to BUPERS via email for commitment. Once approved, BUPERS will commit the estimated cost in SABRS and will immediately notify TYCOM, Region, NSSC, and ISIC and will communicate the approval to the Co mmand. Upon receipt of approval, activities may process DD Form 1149. All local purchases must be obligated before placing an order. Purchases made without obligation caus e unmatched disbursements (Unauthorized Obligations). Once obligated, Commands shall forward DD Form 1149 and the routing sheet to the appropriate NAVSUP FLC Contracting Officer for procurement. NAVSUP FLC will award a contract based on the amount committed on DD Form 1149; th e contract must be routed back to BUPERS for immediate obligation. TYCOM, at their discretion, may delegate to NSSC or ISIC an initial review of local purchases. TYCOMs shall ensure that the description, quantity, and price are included on the requisition document. Re quests must support the MLL and ensure that justification is provided for all food requests involving special meals and receptions. BUPERS shall provide feedback to NAVSUP if approval is questionable and shall inform TYCOM, NSSC, ISIC, and the Regional Galley Program Manager that the requisition is obligated and that the Co mmand may proceed with the order. The TYCOM will submit the FLC contract, amended DD Form 1149 (if required), to BUPERS to close out the funding within SABRS. BUPERS will accept the DD Form 1149 and the contract; they will alter the data as required . Refer to Chapter 5, Paragraph 5500, for Distribution of Receipt Documents from DLA and Naval Activities. These es sential steps will eliminate payment delays; will comply with DODFMR, Vol . 3, Chapter 8, Paragraphs 080301.B and 080302; and will prevent transactions from showing up on the 1960 Unmatched Disbursements (UMDs) because of a missing obligation. Activ ities that have pre- approved and/or pre -obligated requests but that cancel, change, or modify orders before the transaction date must immediately inform BUPERS via email so that immediate adjustments can be made in SABRS. d.Amending DD Form 1149 Prices. The following steps shall be followed for amending DD Form 1149 prices: Ensure that the DD Form 1149 amendment has the same requisition number as the original requisition. Enter the following into the description field: \"Require additional funding due to price differences.\" Specifically indicate the funding amountNAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 4-15from the basic (original) requisition, the funding amount for the amendment, and the overall total. Enter the amendment amount into the \"Total Cost\" and \"Sheet Total\" fields. Enter the overall total in the \"Grand Total\" and \"Amount\" fields. Provide a workbook comparing the prime vendor pricing to the final FLC contract costs, i ncluding all quantity changes. The sum of all price differences must match to the amendment amount on the DD Form 1149. 4.LO CAL PURCHASE OCONUS - AFLOAT. This subparagraph discusses local purchases made OCONUS and afloat. a.Subsistence Procured Via Husbanding Services in Foreign Ports . Subsistence procured via Husbanding Service s in foreign ports requires an increased level of security awareness . SECNAV has directed improvement of Husbandry Service Provider (HSP) processes and contracting vehicles to enhance procurement integrity and to eliminate fraud . To comply with Food Service Financial Improvement Audit Readiness (FIAR) policy, changes have been made to the local purchase policy and requirements . NAVSUP Letter , Afloat Contracting Authority , was released 24 November 2014 . It rescinds ships' contracting authority for negotiat ing contract terms and conditions , establishing contract line item pricing , or plac ing orders for any line item not specifically priced under existing contract vehicles . The use of the DD Form 1155 no longer is authorized. When authorized food items cannot be obtained in areas that do not have established supply channels, deployed units must direct their subsistence requirementsto the appropriate NAVSUP Fleet Logistic Center (FLC) for procurement using DD Form 1149 and a Requisition Routing Sheet . When any other document is used for requisitioning the transaction is considered an Unauthorized Commitment (UAC) that must be ratified pursuant to acquisition regulations . NAVSUP and D LA shall continue to emphasize subsistence procurement policy during fleet Pre- Deployment Briefs, in Logistics Handbooks , and in other related Fleet correspondence . b.Process for Ratification of an Unauthorized Commitment (UAC) . Authority to ratify a UAC is delegated to the Chief of the Contracting Office (CCO) of the servicing FLC. In most circumstances this authority cannot be re -delegated in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 1.602- 3(b)(3) and Navy and Marine Corps Acquisition Supplement (NMCARS) 5201.602-3 . For activities with NAVSUP - delegated contracting authority, the Contracting Officer ( KO) of the supporting FLC may ratify the UAC in close coordination with NAVSUP Global Logistics Support (GLS) N432 . The process for ratification is as follows: The Commanding Officer (CO) must submit a letter addressed to the CCO or to the FLC KO (copy to Contracting Officer's The CO's letter must contain an acknowledgement of the Unauthorized Commitment (UAC) and a detailed explanation of the circumstances leading to the UAC . The CO's letter will contain the following enclosures: oA signed statement from all personnel involved describing the circumstancessurrounding the UAC . oAcknowledgement that no procedures existed that would have prevented a UAC. oExplanation of why the normal procurement procedures were not followed . The CCO or the FLC KO may require more information before making a ratification decision. If the UAC is not ratified, the Command must forward the letter (withenclosures) to t he TYCOM and NAVSUP GLS . The person who authorized the UAC will be held financially responsible and may be required to refund the full amount to the U .S. Government . c.Purchase Processing - Local P urchase Requisition Procedures . The following steps shall be taken to process local purchase requisitions:NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 4-16Purchases shall be made only from approved sources established by the Army Veterinary Service or by Navy Medical Services. Quantities procured shall be strictly limited to immediate requirements necessary to relieve the emergency. All local purchase requisitions must be generated on a DD Form 1149 in the FSM system . The Form must include the following information to ensure that the contract can be executed when the exact cost is known: oa valid requisition number oline of accounting orequired delivery date oquantities obest estimate of price All local purchase requisitions must be forwarded to TYCOM, NSSC, ISIC, or to the Region Galley Program Manager for review with the required justification and the requisition routing sheet . Purchases will be monitored to ensure all subsistence items procured comply with the MLL. Requisitions will not be approved for catered meals from local commercial overseas franchises and fast food establishments . Emergency feeding situations shall be handled on a case- by-case basis . TYCOM will forward DD Form 1149 and the routing sheet to BUPERS for commitment of funds before placing the order (purchases without obligation cause Unmatched Disbursements) . BUPERS shall commit funds and shall send notification TYCOM/Activity with the routing sheet . Commands will forward the DD Form 1149 to the appropriate NAVSUP FLC Contracting Officer for procurement via their TYCOM . Once the contract is awarded with exact amounts , regar dless if the amounts are greater or less than the initial obligated amount s, the contract must be routed back to BUPERS for immediate obligation amount adjustment as necessary . The vendor will provide a receipt on delivery . Upon receipt, the ship will provide a copy of the vendor receipt and of the FSM Receipt Detail Report printout to the TYCOM N432 point of contact ( POC ) and to the Numbered Fleet Commander (NFC) COR . Receipt documents must meet the FIAR requirements (circl e, signed, printed name, and date annotation) . The FSM Receipt Detail Report must contain the following annotation \"Administrative receipt prepared because the vendor invoice receipt did not have a stock number.\" The actualquantity received must be indi cated on the receipt . Erroneous entries shall be lined - out and initialed. This process generally takes 1 or 2 days but may take up to 7 days . SIK will not fund transportation charges, tri walls, dry ice, demurrage (ship detainment) fees, Global Freight Management (GFM) charges , or com missary surcharges . Contracted pierside picnics shall be authorized by TYCOM's approval. Approval shall be given for food costs only and not for any hidden labor or equipment fees . Such non- food fees are to be paid separately from the SIK account . All afloat units shall identify and submit LOGREQ requirements 30 days in advance ( or as soon as operationally possible) of a scheduled port visit using the LOGREQ format prescribed by the applicable NFC. St andardized LOGREQs are located on the Logistics Support Services Repository (LOGSSR) website at: https://my.navsup.navy.mil/apps/ops$logssr.login (registration required).NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 4-17All meat, fish, poultry, dairy (including eggs), and products of foreign origin shall be purchased only in emergencies or when foreign sources are the regular supply sources . Purchases of other food items of foreign origin must be strictly limited. Importing foreign grown fruits, vegetables, meat, and dairy (including eggs) is prohibited. Therefore, GMs afloat must purchase these items only in the quantities that will be completely consumed before arrival in ports in the United States (including Alaska and Hawaii ). Any excess quantities of these items must be disposed of before arrival in any U.S. port. Further guidance can be found in Chapter 6, Paragraphs 6001 and 6002 of this publication. The Senior Medical Department Representative and the Preventive Medicine Authority (PMA) shall be informed when foreign purchases are considered . When an emergency purchase of foreign meats is made from a country infected with the diseases listed below the CO must notify, upon arrival in port, the USDA Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs Inspector in charge so that the propersafeguards will be put in place. The CO must strictly enforce the instructions of the Agriculture Inspector . orinder-pest (also known as cattle plague) ofoot-and-mouth disease oNewcastle disease The list of approved sources can be obtained from Veterinary Services and from theDLA Subsistence Home Page at the following website: http://phc.amedd.army.mil/topics/foodwater/ca/Pages/DoDApprovedFoodSources.as px d.Emergency Requisitioning of Subsistence for Deployed Ships and Submarines . Emerg ency funding requests are defined as procurements for essential food items from a non- Subsistence Prime Vendor source . They are received outside of BUPERS core work hours ( such as overnight or holidays) with a Required Delivery Date (RDD) before resumption of normal Eastern Time Zone business hours. Additional considerations for emergency requisitioning are discussed below. (1)Lead Time. BUPERS requires a minimum lead time of two hours to process the funding for an emergency requisition . Emergency requests should be rare; i f requests occur more than five times per fiscal year, the process must be reevaluated. (2)Process . TYCOMs are responsible for certifying the validity of any emergency requirement and for reviewing the accuracy of the emergency requisition documents (DD Form 1149 and requisition routing sheet) . To obtain funding for the emergency requirement requisition, the TYCOM representative will notify the BUPERS Staff Duty Officer (SDO) via email or phone call . BUPERS Staff Duty Offic er Contact The TYCOM representative shall Provide BUPERS SDO with the following emergency requisition documents: A signed and dated DD Form 1149. A requisition routing sheet signed by the TYCOM and by the requesting activity . Upon receipt and review of the documents, the BUPERS SDO shall provide the TYCOM representative with an authorized BUPERS memorandum that will guarantee funding and will c ontain the BUPERS line of accounting and document number . NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 4-18Note: To ensure expediency, BUPERS PERS- 703 has authorized the BUPERS SDO to take funding actions by providing funding authorization memorandum via email (as opposed to pen and ink signature) . The BUPERS memorandum provides FLC with documentation (in lieu of a BUPERS signed requisition routing sheet) certifying SIK fund availability and provides funding for the emergency requisition. Upon receipt of the BUPERS memorandum, the TYCOM repr esentative shall p rovide the requesting activity with the DD Form 1149, the requisition routing sheet (with TYCOM signature) , and the BUPERS memorandum with an FSM printout to the NAVSUP FLC . The requesting activity or TYCOM shall s ubmit the emergency requisition documents (DD Form 1149, TYCOM signed Requisition Routing Sheet, and the BUPERS memorandum) to the servicing Fleet Logistics Center (FLC) for contracting actions. The TYCOM must p rovide BUPERS with the following supporting obligating documentation within two business days of the processed order. Contract Signed vendor invoice Amended DD Form 1149 (as required ) e.Ordering Via OSO Transfer. The following process shall be followed when ordering via OSO transfer: Request ano ther ship in the Area of Responsibility (AOR) to place a food order. Provide the ship with the required provisions. The ot her ship shall place the order under normal requisitioning procedures. When food arrives, a transfer shall be prepared without reimbursement OSO transfer (DD 1149 - per NAVSUP P-486). This will keep the requisition in the system with the transfer document providing an audit trail. 5.COMM AND OFFICIAL FUNCTIONS: When local purchases are required for Command Official Functions such as holi day or special meals a written justification (an email and DD Form 1149) shall be sent to TYCOM. Upon approval, TYCOM shall forward the request via email to BUPERS. The SIK Appropriation must not be used to fund or subsidize receptions. Under no circumstances will crews ' meals be substituted to offset costs of ORF functions. Paym ent of meals and/or bulk food will be reimbursed to the SIK account in the form of cash, check, and/or funding document . 6.SALE S FROM SHIP'S STORE (ROM3). Ship's Store transactions shall be limited and monitored so that they do not exceed $2,500 ($5,000 for AS/CVN/LCC/LHA/LHD/LSD/LPD) on a monthly basis. Bottled water, canned soda, and individual size food servings as listed in local Prime Vendor Catalogs, and/or may be procured from the Ship's Store to support special meals , disaster feeding, steel beach picnics, box lunch programs, combat feeding, flight meals and in areas where no potable water is available. Individual cans and/or bottles of carbonated and/or noncarbonated beverages are not authorized for use on the serving line in GMs. All sales between the ship's store and the GM must be documented on DD Form 1149. These transactions must be recorded as Receipts with Charge. The GM is not authoriz ed to receive transfers of Ship's Store stock items for the sole purpose of generating stock turn. The Ship's Store is a resale activity that focuses on profit. Only selected items from the standard load list will be authorized. DD Form 1149 will be processed as follows: Forward DD Form 1149 and the requisition routing sheet to TYCOM and/or the Regional Program Director for adherence to policy before submission to BUPERS .NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 4-19The order must have the list of items to be purchased and the costs of the items . The following Functional Account information needs to be hand written on DD Form 1149: oCredit 51000 oCharge OM will f orward the DD Form 1149 and the requisition routing sheet to BUPERS via email for approval and commitment of funds . Once committed by BUPERS, proceed to process via the Ships Store. 7.SALES TO SHIP'S STORE. When the S-3 division orders ship's store products, such as a coffee bar, from the GM's Food Service Division, the S-3 Rec ordskeeper will prepare a Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document (DD Form 1149) following instructions in NAVSUP Pub 487, Par agraph 4103.2, and in the ROM3 User's Guide. The following are key elements for this transaction: Food Service accounting data provided by the FSO shall be used for all S-2 requis itions to populate block 4 of DD Form 1149 in ROM3. T he following must be typed or handwritten in Blo ck 4(b) of DD Form 1149 Date _ _ Th e FSO will approve the transfer. ROM3 will not post DD Form 1149 to the Journal of Receipts (B01/B05 Report), but will post the quantity received to the stock record card and will post the total dollar value as a \"credit expenditure\" to Line B10, Issues to Use, on the Ships Store Balance Sheet (NAVCOMPT Form 153). NOTE TO RECORDS KEEPERS: A common error is forgetting to hand write or type the Functional Account Inf ormation in Block 4(b) of DD Form 1149. The DD Form 1149 shown in Figure 4-2 is provided for ready reference. It shows how to correctly fill out the form. 8.SUBSISTENCE PROCUREMENTS FROM OTHER MILITARY SERVICES AND UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS. Food items may be procured by transfers from other military services or other United States Gov ernment departments. Material will be recorded as a receipt with charge.

Any other commercial equivalent product with essentially the same product characteristics may not be procured by military food service facilities under this law. 2.UNIQUE PACKAGING. If the PV is requested to carry other commercially equivalent products that have essentially the same product characteristics but that come in unique packaging and are not currently provided by the mandatory source, the mandatory source shall have the opportunity to satisfy the requested unique packaging. NAVSUP N432 shall provide justification for t he necessity of the unique packaging.NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 4-22PART C: REQUISITIONING AND PROCUREMENT PROCEDURES 4200 REQUISITION AND PURCHASE ORDER DOCUMENTS USED FOR ACTIV ITIES WHEN NOT ORDERING FROM A SUBSISTENCE PRIME VENDOR 1.GENERAL . The form used for ordering food items depends on the nature of the items and the requirements of the issuing activity . Instructions for preparing these forms are contained in Paragraphs 4201 through 4202. To avoid payment delays to vendors , and to avoid invoices being rejected by Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), G Ms must submit copies of all Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document s (DD Form 1149) directly to the Bureau of Naval Personnel (BUPERS). The R equisition and Invoice/Shipping Document (DD Form 1149) (Figure 4-2) may be used to order one or more line item per purchase order or requisition document. 2. FILES . A n Outstanding Requisition File shall be maintained for DD Form s 1149. These forms shall be maintained in document number sequence within each individual file. 3.MANUA L ORDER PROCESSING . The FSM system does not allow back -fitting of requisitions . Order requisition numbers cannot be entered into the FSM system manually ; they must be created via normal system processing. Every effort must be made to process SIK requisitions through the FSM system; however, there are times when manual order processing is required . Orders shall be considered for manual order processing only in t he following instances: a. Emergency Order . The FSM system is non -operational and food is required on an emergency basis . Emergency basis requirements consist of situations when the FSM system will not be operational and it is essential to place an SIK order immediately tosupport mission requirements. b.Split Order (CLF and STORES PV) . The original food order is referred ashore to the CLO and the requirement is split for fulfillment between a CLF Ship and a STORES PV . When an SIK order is partially fulfilled by a CLF Ship and/or CLO and partially fulfilled via STORES processing, the ordering unit shall receive individual receipt and/or invoice documents from the CLF and/or Cargo Ship issue (Suffix A) and from PV deliver y (Suffix E). 4.REQU IREMENTS APPROVAL DOCUMENTATION . The step- by-step process for requirements approval documentation required for Emergency Order and Split Order offline requisitions is discussed in this subparagraph. The Unit must have prior written approval from TYCOM and/or a higher authority (Regional FSOs , CNIC Regional N9 , NAVSUP FSM) to process manual orders . When prior approval cannot be obtained (for instance, if communications are unavailable) the approval documentation justification must be annotated for after the fact (post order) authorization. All supporting documentation must be retained with the order(s). Regardless of how the manual order is placed (Naval Message, Email, or Requisition Text File), the ordering document must be printed, signed, dated with legible printed name of person signing. The date of signature must be on or before the date the order was transmitted. The person signing must have a current letter of authority by the CO (See Appendix D, page D-14). NOTE: The original manual order Document Number(s) shall be reflected on the obligation and expenditure transactions in SABRS. 4-23NAVSUP P- 486, V ol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management When the FS M sy stem i s back onl ine, the Unit w ill ent er the SIK order(s) into th e FS M system to ensur e that each manually or dered line item i s account ed for i n the system. NOTE: The FSM order Document Number(s) will reflect the receipt processing documentation in the FSM system . They must be cross- referenced to the original manual order Document Number(s) . The original manual order Document Number(s) will be reflected on the obligation and expenditure transactions in SABRS. The ordering document for the FSM system order must be printed, signed, dated, and legible printed name of person signing along with the date the order is entered into the FSM system (Must have CO signed letter of authority). It must be retained with manual order documentation. The new FSM order must not be released for fulfillment because it would result in an additional order for the same line items being placed with a different Document Number. The FSM order created above must be annotated to reflect the Document Number(s) (including the Julian Date) of the manual order doc ument(s) released to STORES and/or PV. NOTE: Cross-r eferencing annotations that tie together the manual and the FSM system order files must be maintained by the Unit and must be provided as audit evidence on request. Supporting documentation for manual order processing must include the following items and must be retained for 10 years in accordance with Financial Management Operations (FMO ) document retention policy: TYCOM and/or Higher Authority Approval Document Original approved manual order with cross -reference annotations FSM system -generated order with cross -reference Annotated Cross -Reference Memorandum (see Figure 4-3) NOTE: As a point of validation, there should be a one -for-one match between the approved manual order and the FSM system -generated order document attributes (National Stock Number (NSN) . 5.SPLIT ORDER (CLF AND PV) . FSM does not allow for partial receipt processing. When the order is split, the U nit will only be able to process receipts against one of the orders. Confirmation from the CLO that the SIK order has been split will indicate which requisitions will be fulfilled by CLF issue and which requisitions will be fulfilled by STORES processing . The Unit must take the following actions to ensure the entire food order is accurately accounted for in the FSM system: Because the original order was created using the PV order method, the U nit must wait until the STORES order is received and then must post receipts in the FSM system for the PV requisitions that have been entirely or partially delivered based on the quantities on the Prime Vendor Receipt . Quantities for requisitions that will be fulfilled by CLF issue must be receipted as zero in the FSM system to account for all requisitions from the original order document. The original ordering document (approved MILSTRIP requisition text file ) must be annotated using the MILSTRIP breakdown in Figure 4 -1 to evidence which requisitions have been referred to the CLO for CLF and/or Cargo fulfillment as part of the split order . NOTE: The original order Document Number(s) will be reflected on the obligation and expenditure transactions in S ABRS. NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 4-24Figur e 4-3 Annotated Cross Reference Memorandum 4-25NAVSUP P- 486, V ol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management After annotating the original ordering document, the Unit must create a new order in the FSM system for the SIK food items that were referred (split) for CLF and/or Cargo Ship fulfillment . The Unit must ensure that each split order line item is accounted for in the new FSM order. NOTE: The FSM order Document Number(s) will reflect the receipt processing documentation in the FSM system and must be cross -referenced to the original order Document Number(s) that were split to the CLF and/or Cargo Ship. The original manual order Document Number(s) will be reflected on the obligation and expenditure transactions in S ABRS.

The new FSM order must be printed, signed, dated, and legible printed name of person signing along with the date the order is entered into the FSM system (Must have CO signed letter of authority). The order must be retained with split order documentation. The new FSM order must not be released for fulfillment because it would result in an additional order for the same line items being placed with a different Document Number. NOTE: Cross-r eferencing annotations that tie together the original order and the FSM system order files must be maintained by the Unit and must be provided as audit evidence on request. Supporting documentation for split order processing must include the following items below and mus t be retained for 10 years in accordance with FMO document retention policy: Original approved order with c ross-reference annotations FSM system -generated order with cross -reference annotations Receipt documentation associated with the entire original order (both the CLF receipts and the Prime Vendor invoice) Annotated Cross -Reference Memorandum (Figure 4-3) As a point of validation, there should be a one -for-one match between the cancelled orders on the original ordering document and the FSM system -generated order d ocument attributes (NSN and quantity ordered) . NOTE: A Cross Reference Memorandum is a mandatory requirement when food orders are created outside of FSM . M anual order processing may be required when FSM is non- operational and food is required on an emergency basis; and when food orders are split betw een CLF ships and the STORES Prime Vendor . To validate the completeness and retention of the required SIK Manual Orders documentation, a Cross Reference memorandum must be prepared . As a point of validation, there must be a one -for-one match between the approved manual order and the FSM -generated orders . Cross -referencing annotations that tie the manual and FSM order files together must be maintained by the unit and provided as audit evidence upon request. 4201 REQUISITIONING FOOD I TEMS FROM NAVY SUPPL Y ACTIVITIES 1.REQUISITIONING PROCEDURES (DD Form 1149) . The FSM system generates DD Form 1149 for automated activities . The Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document (DD Form 1149) (Figure 4-1 ) will be the primary form used for manual requisitioning of food products and will be maintained in \"create\" status until FLC- approved contract prices are received.

Supply Officer s afloat may encounter situations where it is not possible to download the Subsistence Prime Vendor (SPV) catalog and where it may require the assistance of a Subsistence Total Order and Receipt Electronic System (STORES) operator to manually input subsistence requisitions into STORES . It is important to be cognizant of all the supporting entities and/or resources that can provide assistance. These entities and/or resources include the T YCOM Staff, Homeport/Regional Logistics Support Centers (LSC s), Navy Food Management Teams (NFMT s), Fleet Assist Teams (FAT s), and the Navy Cash Fleet Support Group. The p rocess delineated in Figure 4-4 below, Distance Support Provisions Order Process , is seamless given the functionality of FSM and the ability to upload PRIME VENDOR Catalogs (Section B and Section C) for specific geographical regions . When there are errors encountered in Ordering Food Items in FSM (Section D), this guide presents procedures for placing subsistence requisitions manually (Section E, Guidelines for Submitting Emergency Manual Orders) . Understanding the process and the different situations that may arise during execution is the key in ensuring a team 's success. Figur e 4-4 Distance Support Provisions Order Process Not es: ALL stakeholders must be notified throughout the process until the order is received.

Subsistence items received aboard a ship or shore activity have a variety of receipt papers depending on the method of request and the issuing activity. Certain certifications are common to all receipt documents. Receipts must contain the following minimum data elements: Document Number Local Stock Number (LSN) Quantity Unit of Issue If any o f these data elements is unavailable or illegible on the receipt, an administrative and/ or dummy receipt is required. Upon receipt of subsistence items, the Receipt Inspector must take the following steps : Date the document when received. Circle the quantity accepted. Legibl y print full name and sign the document to indicate receipt . Verify the price, quantity , and NSN on the Subsistence Prime Vendor ( SPV) vendor receipt . Record all temperatures and notate the time on the receipt to ensure that authorized personnel receive all food products. If the SPV receipt document changes in quantity received, the incorrect quantity must be lined out; the correct quantity must be hand written, circled, and initialed; and the reasonfor the change must be annotated. The SPV Representative and/or driver must initial allcorrections. The Vet erinary Food Inspector (VFI) must take the following steps: The assigned VFI shall be present at all receipt inspections to identify any concernsabout condition, quality, and wholesomeness. The VFI shall document these issues in the DoD Veterinary Safety Management Information System (VSIMS) and shall communicate all issues to the FSO for action. Commercial source receipts that the VFI deems to be of questionable quality and any items deemed unwholesome, substandard, or non- conforming to the contract shall have a Report of Discrepancy (ROD) issued to prevent a recurrence and to establish a quality history and credit to the Government (see Section on RODs). On rare occasions where a VFI is not available, a Preventive Medicine Authority (PMA)may conduct receipt inspections and relay that information to the Veterinary SupportingService for proper documentation and accountability. All SPV r eceipts must be validated by the FSO for accuracy before submitting them for posting to the Fleet Logistics Center/Chief Logistics Officer (FLC/CLO ) Stores Web Operator . The following are the only authorized SPV receipt validation procedures: The information from the vendor receipt, the information saved in FSM Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedures ( MILSTRIP ), and the Stores Web information mustNAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 5-4be validated for accuracy . Ensure that the Cost Recovery Rate (CRR) is applied appropriately in the Food Service Management (FSM) system. The validated SPV vendor receipt must be forwarded to the FLC/CLO STORES Web operator within 30 days (afloat) and 5 days (ashore) for posting in Stores Web. NOTE: Validated vendor receipts that are not submitted within the specified timelines shall result in suspension of submitting additional requirements in Stores Web. Contact The Immediate Superior in Command/Type Commander (ISIC/TYCOM ) must be contacted immediately when there is a delay . The FSO shall sign and file the validated FSM MILSTRIP, Stores Web Receipt , and SPV receipt in the Food Service Accountability File. NOTE : See Part B, Part C, and Appendix F for detailed guidance. 5001 ANT ICIPATION OF RECEIPTS 1.GENERAL. Shipment notices help anticipate receipt of subsistence items, delivery dates request ed on requisitions, or by other indications that deliveries shall be made on specified dates. The NAVSUP FLC SPV team must notify the customer in advanc e of the expected required delivery date (RDD). When deliveries of food items are expected, the FSO, VFI, and Receipt Inspectors, identified by name, are present. Co ndition an d wholesomeness inspections are always coordinated with the supporting Veterinary Activity. Adequate storage space shall be made available. All provision deliveries will receive a contracted civilian working party as part of SECNAV's Provision On-l oad Program to store the provisions in locations directed by the LCPO, Storeroom Custodian or ship's representative. Except for required shipboard operations, Commands shall not s upplement the civilian working party with military assistance. NAVSUP FLC's LSC must be notified when this occurs . The FSO shall conduct the Cargo Brief with the staff assigned to the working party at least 24 hours before receiving stores . This includes specific working party assignments (civilian and military), conveyors, crane services, elevators , or ramps. Cargo personnel must receive training and updates on the events that pertain to their assignments. 2.RECEIVING CONTROL . Receiving subsistence items involves several separate steps. The general term \"receipt\" includes the following: Planning Preparation Inspection Storage Processing Receipts Posting Records Paying Dealers' Bills Proper r eceipt of food items is important in establishing and maintaining control of the food service operation. The FSO is responsible for proper receipt control procedures throughout ordering, receiving, and storing. 3.WORKI NG PARTY ASSIGNMENTS WHEN CONTRACTED WORKING PARTIES ARE UNAVAILABLE. There shall be a ship's instruction that indicates the number of personnel each department must supply for the various working parties . A few days before delivery , and on the day of delivery, the working party requirements for that day's delivery are in the plan of the day . A list from each department of the personnel they have assigned to the working party creates the muster list for the working party . When there is a working party consisting of personnel fromNAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 5-5other departments, supply personnel serve as checkers, spotters, and supervisors to the greatest extent possible . Civilian work parties must be used when available and shall be scheduled through the local NAVSUP FLC SPV coordinators . 4.ST OREROO MS. The bulk storeroom custodian is aware of the delivery and ensures that the storeroom is ready . Subsistence items shall be arranged so that the oldest stock shall be issued out first (first in- first out) according to the use by , best by , sell by , or expiration date (original package date not Prime Vendor (SPV) sticker date) . This includ es taking into account the condition of each product. 5.RECO RDS . It is a good practice to conduct an inventory before receipt of new food items to ensure that actual on-hand balances are in agreement with the storeroom inventory . Stock records are posted and up- to-date to provide the control needed in resolving any differences that occur during the receipt process. 6.INC OMING REQUISITION . This file contains copies of all outstanding requisition and purchase documents for use by the bulk storeroom custodian who shall physically receive the food items . 5002 RE CEIPT DOCUMENTS USED 1.RECEIPTS FROM THE PRIME VENDOR . The following constitute receipts from the Prime Vendor: Receipt Document Vendor's Delivery Invoice 2.RECE IPTS FROM COMMERCIAL VENDORS . Receipt documents used for purchases from commercial vendors shall be one of the following: Order for Supplies or Requisition and Invoice Shipping Document (DD Form 1149 ) Vendor delivery invoices 3.REC EIPTS FROM MILITARY ACTIVITIES . Receipts from military activities are discussed below. a.Receipts from Defense Logistics Agency .

Receipt Documents from Military Activities . Receipt documents from military activities shall be one of the following : DoD Single Line Item Release/Receipt Document (DD Form 1348-1- A) Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Documents (DD Form 1149) (Required by the issuing activity ) 4.REC EIPTS FROM OTHER END USERS. The Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document (DD Form 1149) shall be used for requisitions from other end users .NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 5-6PART B: RECEIPT AND INSPECTI ON PROCEDURES FOR SUBSISTENCE PRIME VENDOR 5100 B ACKGROUND 1.DEFENSE LOGISTICS AGENCY GUI DANCE . The Defense Logistics Agency ( DLA) Troop Support Website provides specific guidance on quality assurance during receiving . The contracted quality assurance responsibility belongs to DLA Troop Support , SPV Branch, and Directorate of Subsistence. Day-to-day quality assurance is the responsibility of the ordering activity . At many ordering activities, the receiving official is the government 's first-line quality assurance representative and is the final authority for accepting or rejecting products . Products with health factor concerns , such as suspected unwholesomeness, are placed on medical hold until cleared of condemned by a VFI or PMA . Wholesomeness determination is the responsibility of the U.S . Army Veterinary Services while in port and at fixed installations and can be coordinated for deployed situations . Table 5- 1, Table 5- 2, and Table 5- 3 at the end of this Section present characteristics used for determining the quality of meat, fruits, and vegetables. Wh er e Military Medical activities are supporting the ordering activit ies receipt inspection of multiple -line commercial products, medical receipt inspection should focus primarily on the examination for the wholesomeness and sanitary condition of approved sources, consistent with the direction of the responsible PMA and U.S . Army Veterinary Services . A spot-checking system may be used w hen it is unreasonably difficult, or when it shall unduly delay delivery conveyances, to perform a destination inspection at the time of delivery . Spot- checking should be rare and consistent with the direction of the responsible medical authority and the risk assessment made clear to the Commander . Delivery conveyances are not unduly delayed for performing a receipt inspection. 2.GEN ERAL FOOD SERVICE OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES. The FSO is responsible for establishing systems and procedures that ensure products received from the SPV conform to contract specifications and inspected for quality, quantity, and wholesomeness consistent with the direction of the responsible VFI or PMA. A ppendix F, Inspection Guide for Subsistence Serviceability Afloat/Ashore, provides a convenient guide for daily use and reference . 3.MI LITARY MEDICAL VETERINARY INSPECTION RESPONSIBILITIES . The U.S . Army Veterinary Service is responsible for Food Safety and Product Compliance Evaluations . The U.S. Army Veterinary Service maintains an installation support plan to include the SPV and ensures a high level of performance accordingly . Routine inspections verify that the products are safe and wholesome . The Army Vete rinary Food Inspectors inspect deliveries on the pier and onboard ships . The FSO or his representative may request U.S . Army Veterinary Service s or the PMA to assist with any determination that delivered food is in less than excellent condition. The U.S . Army Vet erinary Service inspectors shall provide a written report to the FSO after concluding pier side or onboard inspection for the day of the inspection. Please be advised that U.S. Army Veterinary Service inspectors may not be available for all SP V deliveries - on those rare occasions, the Preventive Medical Authority may perform the inspection. 4.SUBSI STENCE PRIME VENDOR RESPONSIBILITY FOR QUALITY . Subsistence items received from commercial vendors shall originate only from approved sources. In the CONUS, all food items shall be of U .S. origin in compliance with the Berry Amendment . All meat or meat food products delivered within the United States shall bear on the item , or on the originalNAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 5-7package, the stamp or label of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to certify that the meat or meat products have been U.S . Inspected and Passed. A United States Department of Commerce Certified Shellfish Shipper's Certificate must accompany all shipments of unshucked shellfish. This tag, attached to the container is to remain attached until the container is empty and then filed for 90 days . Fresh crustaceans (lobster and crab) must be alive to be accepted. 5.BE RRY AMENDMENT. The Berry Amendment and its exceptions are discussed below. a.Berry Amendment . The Berry Amendment ( USC, Title 10 and Section 2533a) requires the DoD to give preference in procurement to domestically produced foodstuffs . Domestic Non -Availability Determinations (DNADs) are possible when items grown or produced in the U. S. are not in satisfactory quality and in sufficient quantity as part of the review . The status of Berry Amendment compliance of various fresh fruits and vegetables is available to DLA and the local supporting Veterinary Service Activities . All Navy procured subsistence in the U.S . must be Berry Amendment compliant. b.Berry Amendment Exceptions. The Berry Amendment does not apply to acquisitions outside the U.S in support of deployed, contingency or combat operations . It also does not apply to acquisitions of perishable foods by or for activities located outside the U.S . for personnel of these activities . This includes vessels in foreign waters.

Consult with the supporting Army Veterinary Service representative to determine that appropriate local health authorities have been notified of any confirmed wholesomeness problems . c.Afloat Units Underway . Items inspected by the PMA and found to be non- hazardous must be kept on board until the ship is back to its homeport and items can be returned to the vendor for a replacement. However, if the storage capacity does not permit such action to be taken, or if keeping the items on board creates an unhealthy environment, these items must be surveyed. When surveyed, provide pictures of the surveyed item(s) and a certificate of unfitness for human consumption from the medical department . A copy of the survey form with the Supply Discrepancy Report (SF 364) must be supplied to DLA via TYCOM /FLC and NAVSUP N432 for credit resolution. FSOs shall follow the procedures set forth in this publication for surveying and disposing of food items deemed hazardous . If possible, a picture of the hazardous item(s) shall be obtained. The PMA shall provide a certificate of unfitness for human consumption form that confirms that the discrepancy was not caused by any action of the ship. The FSO shall consult with PMA before discarding any food items suspected to be hazardous or unsafe.

All food items must be inspected on delivery to verify their acceptability before signing for receipt . Receipt personnel may request assistance by local AVI personnel to assist in verification of subsistence items. This inspection must include temperature (for chill and frozen), age (date of pack), and condition. Select s amples from the rear, middle, and front of the delivery van. Mixed load sampling must include representative samples of each type of product . This information is necessary to make the proper decision for initial acceptance and/or subsequent issue . Any food item received in less than excellent condition must be reported or rejected in accordance with Paragraph 5200 or Paragraph 5201. A local code (such as different color markings on cases) may be established to identify the receipt date to be used with Date Of Pack (DOP) and inspection results so that a First In First O ut (FIFO) procedure shall be effective. First In -First Out ( FIFO ) is a procedure that determines only the order of precedence for issue. The final decision for issue shall depend on product condition as determined by inspection. 3.QUANT ITY INSPECTION UPON RECEIPT . Inspection of quantity upon receipt is discussed below. a.Receipt from Navy Sources . The Receipt Inspector shall inspect the quantity of food items received, circle the exact quantity received (unit of issue) , and legibly print, sign, and date the receipt document ( see Figure 5- 1). The Receipt Inspector shall e nsure that the proper quantity ( the quantity on the receipt document m atches the quantity received) . Net weights marked on standard packages received from the Navy or other government agencies are acceptable. The quantity on the outside of the container received from government sources shall be accepted providing the container has not been opened . The quantity indicated on the container must be checked if the container has been opened. The Receipt Inspector then shall forward the receipt documents to the FSO. b.Receipt from Commercial Sources Other than Prime Vendor . Upon receipt of provisions from a commercial source, the Receipt Inspector shall remove one copy of each delivery ticket and forward them to the bulk storeroom custodian before counting the food items . If only one copy of a delivery ticket is provided, an additional copy shall be made and forwarded to the bulk storeroom custodian. The Receipt Inspector shall then inspect and circle the quantity received and shall sign and date the copy with the date the items that were received (Figure 5 -2). The quantity on the outside of containers received from commercial sources shall be confirmed by randomly selecting at least one case of each line item and ensuring that quantities indicated on the outside of a container match the actual contents . The quantity indicated on the container must be checked on any container that has been opened. This person then forwards the document to the Recordskeeper for posting. c.Definite Delivery Contract . The Recordskeeper records and circles the exact quantity received on the deliver y ticket. 4.SHORT AGES AND OVERAGES. Shortages and overages shall be handled in accordance with Paragraph 5206 and Paragraph 5207. 5205 UNS ATISFACTORY SUBSISTENCE ITEMS The subsistence supply system has quality provisions designed to guarantee the receipt of wholesome, satisfactory food items at military general messes . However, DoD procurement systems may experience breakdowns that allow some unsatisfactory products to filter into the military pipeline . As an aid to cont rolling or eliminating this situation, unsatisfactory food items must be reported promptly upon receipt in accordance with the procedures outlined in NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 5-18Paragraph 5300 and Paragraph 5301 . Speed and accuracy in reporting discrepancies is important especially if the product is hazardous/suspect . In all instances, immediate reporting of defective food items shall enable the contracting agency to initiate warranty action against the supplier, thereby protecting the financial interests of the government . Defect s discovered after receipt ( during inspections, breakouts, or preparation) must be reported when the defective condition was not caused by mishandling or over-aging of the item while in the custody of the using activity . This shall enable the contracting agency to initiate warranty action against the supplier, thereby protecting the financial interests of the government. 5206 SHOR TAGES IN SHIPMENT A shortage occurs when the quantity received is less than the quantity shown on the receipt document, regardless of the quantity on the original requisition . A shortage may occur because of a shipping (item) or packing discrepancy . If a shortage exists, immediately contact DLA Account Manager to resolve discrepancies . 5207 OVERA GES IN SHIPMENT 1.GENERAL. An overage occurs when the quantity received exceeds the quantity stated on the receipt document regardless of the quantity on the original requisition. When an overage occurs, the receiver and the issuer must establish immediate liaison to resolve the discrepancies. Overage s on receipts create variances and funding issues between SIK obligations and expenditures . Justifications are required from the command and TYCOM and forwarded to BUPERS when the quantity results in the expenditures are more than an obligation is. In port , quantities received that are greater than quantities ordered shall be returned to the Prime Vendor to avoid unauthorized commitments. 2.OVERAGE DOCUM ENTATION . When discrepancies from a Navy source are unable to be resolved, the Receipt Inspector shall indicate on the receipt document the actual quantity received by annotating and circling the quantity received and drawing a single line through the invoiced quantity . The Receipt Inspector shall then sign and date the receipt document in accordance with Paragraph 5202 and Paragraph 5204 ( Figure 5 -3) and shall forward the document to the FSO. The subparagraphs below present additional information. a.Items Received Without a Receipt Document . If the receipt is damaged or illegible beyond recognition, or when processing over -aged shipments, the unit/activity is required to create an \"administrative/dummy receipt\" . A \"Dummy Receipt Document\" shall then be prepared by the Recordskeeper to document the excess quantity received. This dummy receipt document is a DoD Single Line Item Release/Receipt Document(DD Form 1348-1- A) or Requisition Invoice/Shipping Document (DD Form 1149) . At a minimum, the Administrative/Dummy Receipt must contain the following: A clear defininition of the purpose of the receipt ( the item was missing, damaged, or lost in shipment) Document Number NSN Quantity Unit of Issue The date received The Adm inistrative and/ or Dummy Receipt shall require one of the following: Legibly printed full name with signature by receiving member and date received, with substantiating documentation (packing slip/delivery ticket).NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 5-19Legibly printed full name with signature by the receiving member and date received on an FSM or STORES screenshot. The system date must be clearly visible on the screen shot coinciding with the receipt date. First and second line signatures, legibly printed names, and dates without substantiating doc umentation. Second line signature must be E7 or above or leading CS if not E7 at command or civilian equivalent. NOTE: In instances where a receipt does not contain the minimum required elements for a receipt (NSN or NIIN, item name, unit of issue, and quantity), the unit/activity must create an administrative/dummy receipt to be attached to the substantiating documentation delivered with the material. Both documents must be signed, dated, and have legibly printed name of person signing (2nd line signature is not required when substantiating documentation (i.e., vendor receipt) is attached. b.Dummy Receipt Document Preparation.

It shall be used as the source document for posting the excess receipt to the Subsistence Ledger (NAVSUP Form 335) and the Record of Receipts and Expenditures (NAVSUP Form 367) . c.Prepar ation of DD Form 1348-1-A . DD Form 1348-1- A shall be prepared using all the information on the original receipt document with the exception of the quantity and totalprice . The quantity block shall contain the excess quantity actually received. Zero fill as necessary ( for example, 28 ea = 00028) . The total price block shall contain the dollar value of the excess quantity times the unit price. \"DUMMY INVOICE TO COVER EXCESS SHIPMENT\" shall be annotated on the document . A statement that cross - referenc es the original receipt document with the \"Dummy Invoice\" (Figure 5 -4) shall be provided to distinguish the dummy receipt from the normal receipt . When possible, all excess quantities not ordered should be returned. If overages must be accepted, the Receipt Inspector and bulk storeroom custodian must circle the excess received, then both shall sign and date the dummy invoice. The dummy invoice must then be forwarded to the FSO . A dummy invoice also shall be used when food items are received without invoices or with unpriced invoices until the correct invoices are received. Prices shall then be cross -referenced and differences correctly posted to NAVSUP Form 367. d.Administration/Dummy Receipts with the FSM System Date Validation. When a screen shot from the unit/activity's BLA is use d to creat e the Administrative/ Dummy receipt the BLA system date, readable on the screen shot, may validate when the receipt was created as long as it coincides with the receipt date. In this instance, only a legible signature of the member receiving the material is required. e. Administration and/or Dummy Receipts Not Digitally Signed. For administrative and/or dummy receipts not digitally signed (CAC signature and date), a legible first and second line signature and date must be recorded on the Administrative/Dummy receipt within 72hours after it has been created. The second line signature must be by an E7 or above or GS/Civilian supervisor level equivalent for all Operational Forces and Ashore units/activities . For units/activities that do not have an E7 or above, the senior member of the team shall be responsible for the second line signature. 3.OVERAGES FROM A CO MMERCIAL SOURCE . When an overage occurs from a commercial vendor, the Receipt Inspector and bulk storeroom custodian shall sign only for the requested quantities on the receipt documents in accordance with Paragraph 5203 and Paragraph 5204 and shall forwa rd the documents to the FSO. Any excess quantities shall be returned to the vendor.NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 5-205208 UNEXPECTED SHIP SCHEDULE CHANGE When a ship is redirected from a scheduled port visit, and provisions cannot be cancelled or an Other Supply Officer (OSO) transfer cannot be performed in a timely manner , the local NAVSUP FLC, Regional Supply Center (RSC) or the assigned Commander Task Force (CTF) shall be contacted immediately . The following steps shall be undertaken: The FSO must attem pt to obtain a copy of the receipt document . The r eceipt document must be posted as an RWC for the quantity shown on the receipt regardless if subsistence has been received. A DD F orm 200 must be completed to initiate the remov al of items from inventory . 5209 P ORT CLEARANCE FOR FOOD PRODUCTS 1.GENERAL . It is the responsibility of the vessel's Commanding Officer to notify Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of a pending vessel arrival and to provide the proper passenger/cargo documents upon arrival. The CB P must complete their baggage/cargo inspection before the embarking or disembarking of personnel or loading or unloading of stores. 2.CLE ARANCE REQUIRMENTS .

Nonhazardous food items are products that do not meet expected or desired standards but do not constitute a health hazard to personnel if consumed. Subsistence contracts contain quality assurance provisions designed to guarantee the receipt of wholesome,satisfactory food items at military dining facilities . However, D oD procurement systems may experience breakdowns that allow some unsatisfactory products to filter into the militarypipeline. As an aid to eliminating/controlling t his situation, unsatisfactory food items must be reported promptly upon receipt in accordance with the procedures outlined in Paragraph 5300 and Paragraph 5301 . Speed and accuracy in reporting discrepancies is important, especially if the product is hazardous and/or suspect . In all instances, immediate reporting of defective food items shall enable the contracting agency to initiate warranty action against the supplier, thereby protecting the financial interests of the government . Defects discovered after receipt such as breakdown during inspection, breakouts, or preparation should be reported provided that thedefective condition wa s not caused by mishandling or over -aging of the item while in custody of the using activity.

Photogr aphs and samples must be taken for testing before placing the item on medical hold in accordance with subparagraph 5301.4 below . 2.EXAM PLES OF POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS FOOD ITEMS. The following are examples of potentially hazardous food items: Widespread presence of swollen or leaking cans . (The contents of bulged or swollen cans must never be consumed) . Products with offensive or unusual odors and colors and/or any other evidence ofdeterioration, spoilage, or contamination. An attempt must be made to determine whether or not the hazardous condition is caused by an isolated instance of excessive storage or by mishandling before reporting the item as hazardous . Food items containing foreign objects such as glass, dirt, or pieces of metal . A sample of the contaminant must be forwarded to HQ, DLA, ATTN: , by the most expedient means . Communication accompanying the sample must indicate if the problem appears to involve only a single unit/container of the product and must include the estimated percentage of units/containers involved when possible. Photographs are the preferred form of documentation. Any apparently wholesome food items that, based on the best available medical knowledge or from an ALFOODACT message, is suspected or known to harbor disease - causing agents .

Code, Chapter 39 of Title 31, federal agencies are required to pay interest penalties for late payment of a proper dealer's invoice. All activities with procurement authority are required to certify and forward proper invoices promptly to the paying activity specified in the purchase order to ensure good business relationships with vendors, improved efficiency of the bill paying functions , and reduced cost of goods and service, . For most purchases, payment is due within 30 days of the date of acceptance of material/services or receipt of invoice, whichever is later, unless another date is specified in the contract . All activities are required to submit invoices for payment within five working days following certification and acceptance of the goods or services to allow the paying activity sufficient time to comply with the above periods . NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 5-50PART H: STOWAGE 5700 ST OWAGE Guide for Subsistence Serviceability Afloat/Ashore is available for convenient daily us e and reference. Take care and keep food items away from areas where asphalt, fuel, creosote, or lubricating oils are present. No Smoking allowed in food storage spaces. Fo od i tems are always stored in their original containers. Issue items i n damaged containers or bags immediately if they are fit for human c onsumption; otherwise survey. If there is any doubt about the fitness of food for human consumption, Army veterinary personnel shall inspect the item or the Navy PMA shall survey the item surveyed if found to be unfit. All food items always shall be inspected regularly for signs of damage, spoilage, insect infestation, or rodent contamination. Inspect perishable items daily and semi-p erishable items on a cyclical basis as required. Insulate heat pipes to prevent the transfer of heat to stored food items. When painting storage areas, chill and freeze spaces or refrigeration equipment use quick-drying, odor-free paint to avoid absorption of paint odors by stored foods. 2.ARRANGEMENT AN D PRESERVATION. Storerooms in which food items are stored shall be kept clean and clear of unnecessary traffic and unpleasant odors. Arrange in a neat and orderly fashion. Bulk food should be stowed by item and date of manufacture or by date of receipt to facilitate breakouts, inventories, and proper rotation of stock. Case lots s hall be store d on grating and not directly on the dec k. Open spaces shall be provided between stacks of cases or pallets. Space shall be provided between cases and structural obstructions (such as s team pipes) to permit maximum ventilation. Stagnant air is detrimental to perishable items. 3.ISSUING A ND ROTATION. The oldest food supplies on hand in the bulk storeroom should be issued first. Generally, it is \"first in, first out.\" However, when deployed overseas, food supplies that were manufactured before the stock procured in the United States may be received from CLF ships when loading out. Manufacturers' age codes are especially important in this c ase because they indicate the date of manufacture. The \"new\" food supplies received may actually be older than the food supplies already in the bulk storeroom, and the older food supplies must be issued first. 4.SPECIAL STORAGE PRECAUTIONS. The storage guidance discussed here is based on the availability of adequate storage facilities designed to give the normal range of protection for various types of food items. If food items are stored in other than normal facilities (such as rail cars, portable reefers, or substandard storerooms), food service personnel must exercise special and continuous close surveillance over suc h spaces to ensure that prescribed storage temperatures are constantly maintained to prevent damage to products stored. Severe deviations f rom normal storage temperatures must not be tolerated. 5.FRESH ITEMS. Fresh items shall be handled expeditiously to reduce their exposure to weather el ements, and they shall be kept free of foreign materials that could cause spoilage. Citrus fruits, onions, tomatoes, cabbages, cantaloupes, and celery must not be stored with eggs, butter , or in rooms where it is possible for odors from such fruits and vegetables to be absorbed. Ethylene Control Devices (ECDs), when properly installed in refrigerated spaces, may extend shelf life and may assist in protecting these fruits and vegetables from other fruits and vegetables that produce harmful odors. All fast-moving food and drink items must be kept refrigerated at the proper temperature except when being prepared or served. 6.PROPER STORAGE CONDITIONS. The following must be complied with to maintain proper s torage conditions:NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 5-51All refrigerated spaces shall be kept in a clean, neat, and orderly manner . Stocking must start from the bulkheads and work inward toward the center, starting at least four inches in from bulkheads or coils . Overloading the storerooms decreases the efficiency of the cooling equipment, makes cleaning more difficult, and may lead to sanitation problems . For some platforms ( such as submarines) typical storage requirements may be impracticable. Removal of cans from cases is common practice onboard submarines. All containers, especially those in the center of the pallet, must be checked for spoilagewhen storing full pallets of produce. Any spoiled items must be removed as soon as possible to prevent exposure to fresh produce. ECD may help prevent the spread of spoiled food toxins. 7.F ROZEN ITEMS (FRUITS, VEGETABLES, AND MEATS) . Upon delivery, frozen items must be transferred promptly to a freezer storage space . The temperature of the load shall be c hecked upon arrival by checking internal temperatures of items selected at random throughout the load. 8.M EDICAL SUPPLIES. Medicines or medical supplies used for Chemical, Biological and Radiological, Nuclear Defense requiring refrigeration shall only be stored in food service spaces in order to preserve medical supplies when no other refrigeration space is available onboard . T he following are specific requirements for storing medical supplies in food service spaces: Request letter from the Senior Medical Officer approved and signed by the CommandingOfficer. This includes storage requirement with estimated date/length of storage. There must be a Medical Custodian assigned to ensure that all medical supplies are secured and stored properly and safely within food service spaces. Proper storag e i ncludes the following: oMedical supplies shall be stored in a lockable refrigerator . It is highly recommended that all medical supplies be stored in their own individual lockable refrigerator and are maintained separately from food items when possible . oA ll medical supplies shall be stored in a sealed and leak -proof container . oA ll medical supplies must be properly labeled and the storage container for medicines and/or medical supplies must be properly labeled with the following: \"Container for the storage of medicines\". Refer to the Tri -Service Food Code, NAVMED P5010 for additional guidance for the proper storage of medicines in a food establishment. 9.BR EAST MILK. Each Command must have a policy for support ing breastfeeding by Servic e Mem bers as directed in BUMEDINST 6000.14A as a normal and healthy behavior . Because breast milk never is treated as a biohazard, the need to store breast milk with medical supplies is not required; although this may be considered as the first option in storing breast milk for a Service Member . When refrigerated units in a medical storage area are unavailable, there breast milk may be stored in food service refrigerated units and/or spaces . The following are requirement s for storing breast milk. Food Service Medical Screening for the participant . The p articipant must report all symptoms of illness to medical personnel for evaluation Breast milk shall be labeled and segregated in a sealed plastic container that shall have the following: oClearly labeled with the Service Member 's rank, name, and Division . oThe d ate and time of storage . oThe e xpiration date ( maximum of 5 days includ ing the extraction day). oClearly marked \" BREAST MILK NOT FOR FOOD SERVICE USE \".NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 5-52The same requirement s apply w hen breast milk is fr ozen . Breast milk must never be stored in a freezer longer than 12 months according to medical guidelines . Breast milk shall be removed to the Service Member's home at every available opportunity . It i s recomme nded that CS trainin g includes an understanding of the personal nature of breast milk and its storage. Food service personnel shall report immediately to medical personnel anything unusual with the storage of breast milk. Ref er to the following links for additional safety and storage requirements for breast milk: https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/recommendations/faq.html and Air circulation in a stor eroom, and proper temperature and humidity, plays an important part in the correct storage of fresh and frozen foods . The use of a fan or duct system is helpful in maintaining good circulation in all parts of the room . Generally, when the recommended temperature in all parts of the refrigerated space is the same and is maintained in the stocks in the freezer space, the circulation of air may be considered adequate. Storerooms containing fresh fruits and vegetables do not usually require outside air, but when the compartment is kept at a temperature of 40\u00b0F or higher, the carbon dioxide given off by the fruits and vegetables sometimes may reach a high level . Under this condition, a supply of fresh air should be circulated in the room before personnel are allowed to work there. Use of Ethylene Absorber Blankets and/or Ethylene F ilters is highly recommended to reduce ethylene gas levels and to prolong the storage life of perishable foods . Frozen items shall be clearly marked with the date the food was removed from the freezer and shall be used or discarded within seven (7) days from removal. 5702 STORAGE LIFE OF FROZEN PERISHABLE FOOD ITEMS 1.GENERAL . Frozen perishable food items can be considered shelf -stable because of their long shelf life . A storage temperature of 0 \u00b0F generally is considered desirable when storing frozen food . Food items deteriorate with time at a rate that largely depends on the sum of all the time- temperature variables . Frozen food items become less stable and are likely to deteriorate faster when stored at temperatures greater than 0\u00b0F. As a rule of thumb, for every 18\u00b0 F. rise in temperature, the rate of deterioration can double, triple, or quadruple, depending on the item . The effect of excessive temperature changes on quality is cumulative; therefore, frequent inspections during storage are essential. When frozen food items show signs of deterioration, efforts should be taken to ensure the item is suitable for intended use andimmediate issue. This helps to keep losses at a minimum . Rotation of frozen food items is extremely important . Frozen items should not be allowed to accumulate in storage, and a first in-first out (FIFO) policy must be strictly followed. Issues of frozen food items m ust be based on results of inspections performed by an AVI or a designated representative of the PMA when a product's suitability for intended use is suspect. 2.OP TIMAL CONDITIONS . Storage temperature for all frozen perishable food items shall not exceed 0\u00b0 F. 3.LESS THAN OPTIMAL STORAGE CONDITIONS. The storage life of frozen food items is greatly reduced when stored in temperatures greater than 0 \u00b0F. Such storage conditions cause reduced quality . Thawed food items must not be refrozen. The items must be consumed immediately or discarded, depending on inspection results.NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 5-535703 FREEZING POINT, STORAGE TEMPERATURE, AND STORAGE LIFE OF CHILLED PERISHABLE FOOD ITEMS Bulk storeroom storage temperature for chilled perishable food items generally must be maintained between 32\u00b0F to 41\u00b0F . B etter quality may be maintained for some items at temperatures higher or lower than this range. Reach- in refrigerators used for short term storage of chilled perishable food items must be maintained between 32\u00b0F to 41\u00b0F. 5704 STORAGE OF SEMI -PERISHABLE FOOD ITEMS 1.GENERAL . Semi- perishable items are those that do not require refrigeration. The te rm s emi-peris hable food items includes canned goods, flour, dry cereal, flour, and shelf -stabl e f oods that, under normal conditions, are stored in non- refrigerated spaces . It also includes food items such as cooking oil, nuts, hard cheeses, onions, potatoes, and other foods that do no t r equire refrigeration but that still have a limited shelf life . Although semi -perishable food items are not nearly as susceptible to spoilage as perishable food items, spoilage can and will occur if the products are mishandled, improper ly stored, or stored for too long. The length of storage must be based on the date of pack and not on the date of receipt. 2.S TORAGE CONDITIONS . The optimum storage conditions for most semi -perishable food items are clean, cool, dry, and well-ventilated. High temperature and high humidity accelerate spoilage by promoting the deterioration of containers and the growth of bacteria in the foodproduct . Freezing is detrimental to the quality of products with high water content , but most items remain edible after having been frozen and thawed. Infestation by rodents and insects may cause great damage to items packaged in bags, boxes , and cartons . Such items tend to absorb odors and lose flavor . This is especially true in storage areas that lack adequat e ve ntilation. Physical environmental factors are discussed below. a. Freezing . Dry products such as flour, sugar, and dehydrated foods ordinarily are not injured by freezing . The usefulness and palatability of wet -packed items is not affected by freezing, although their physical appearance may suffer because of softening of their texture. Emulsions such as canned cheese, prepared mustard , and cream soups may be destroyed by freezing that results in loss of quality, although the food is not spoiled . C are must be taken to examine packaging after freezing to ensure the integrity of the container. b.High Temperatures . High storage temperatures encourage bacteria and mold growth and insect infestation . High storage temperatures are particularly dangerous w hen ac companied by high humidity . This situation accelerates natural chemical action, causing rancidity in many items . This is caused by food acids that are present in t he c ans becoming activated; the result i s pin-holing, blackening of the interior, and hydrogen swells . High temperature is the chief cause of accelerated spoilage in canned foods and should be controlled by providing adequate ventilation. c.Moisture (Humidity) . High humidity is detrimental to stored food items because it accel erates the growth of bacteria and mold, promotes insect infestation, and causes mustiness in flour, rice, and similar foods . High humidity also may cause caking of products , such as salt and sugar that absorb moisture . Moisture also causes rusting of cans. Rust, unless it actually penetrates the can and causes leakage, generally does not harm the content s or serve as a reason for survey. 3.O VER-AGED STOCK. The safe storage period for dry subsistence varies with the type of product, storage temperatures, humidity control, handling care, protection from weather, and type of packaging and packing. The maximum shelf life of all food items wil l be decreased by extremes in temperature and humidity. 4.ID ENTIFICATION OF SPOILED ITEMS. A change in color of a food product indicates a loss of quality and may indicate spoilage . Unpleasant odors and flavors are the best way toNAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 5-54identify spoilage without submitting the item to a qualified laboratory for examination. Swollen cans (referred to as swellers, springers , or flippers ) depending on the degree of gas formation, are caused by chemical or bacterial action or by overfilling . Regardless of the suspected cause, cans having such defects must be separated and placed on hold status . Before any survey action is initiated, Items suspected of being unfit for human consumption shall be inspected by AVIs, when assigned, by PMA , by the Navy preventive medicine unit, or by the station sanitation officer for confirmation of the unsatisfactory condition. NOTE: Appendix F, Inspection Guide for Subsistence Serviceability Afloat/Ashore is provided for convenient daily use and reference. NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 5-55PART I: HANDLING OF FRUITS, VEGETABLES, MEATS, ANIMAL PRODUCTS , AND GARBAGE ABOARD NAVY SHIPS AND AIRCR AFT RETURNING FROM FOREIGN OR OFFSHO RE UNITED STATES PORTS 5800 GENERAL 1.GENERAL . OP NAVINST 6210.2 (series) and OPNAV M -5090.1 provide guidance for conformance with regulations of the United States Departments of Health and Human Services, Agriculture, Homeland Security, and Commerce. The Government regulations prevent theintroduction and dissemination, domestically or elsewhere, of diseases of humans, plants , animals, prohibited or illegally taken wildlife, arthropod vectors, and pests of health andagricultural importance. Introduction and dissemination of these products into the United States and its territories, commonwealths, and possessions may occur from movement of U.S . Military ships, aircraft, or other transport of the Armed Forces when they arriv e at or leav e military installations in the United States and foreign countries or ports or other facilities under the jurisdiction of the Federal agencies listed above. 2.IN SPECTION LIAISON . Commanders are responsible for maintaining liaison with loca l r epresentatives of the Department of Homeland Security, Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, Agriculture Inspection (DHS -CBP-AI), Veterinary Services of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), USDA, and other appropriate government agencies . I nspectors of these agencies shall be notified by the commanders , as far in advance as practical, of the arrival or departure of any vessel under the purview of established regulations. 5801 INSPECTION 1.PORT ENTRY INSPECTION . An inspector or a designated representative of the DHS- CBP- AI shall board U.S . Military ships and aircraft at the first United States port of entry to inspect for fruits, vegetables, and meat that have been grown, produced, or processed in any foreign country (excluding Canada) or in Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Americ an S amoa, Guam, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands . All food wastes, wrappers, containers, and disposable materials from the items shall also be inspected. When fruits, vegetables, and meat are found, the inspector shall determine what disposal or safeguarding action is necessary . In 1992, APHIS granted the Navy special procedures for handling meat carried as cargo aboard U.S . Military vessels returning from foreign countries . Meat in this case is defined as fresh, dried, or canned meats or meat by -products prepared from pork, beef, lamb, poultry, or other terrestrial (land) animals. 2.I NSPECTOR BOARDING . A DHS -CBP-AI inspector shall board any U.S . Military ship or aircraft that has called on any foreign port and returns to any United States port . The c ommanding officer or the designated representative the identity of all port visits and/or underway replenishments to determine if fruits, vegetables, meat, milk, or eggs aboard procur ed out side the United States shall inform the DHS -CBP-AI inspector . Treat opened cartons of U.S . or igin fruits, vegetables, meat, milk, and eggs as if the items were procured outside the United States . Fruits, vegetables, meat, milk, and eggs of foreign origin, and opened cartons of like items of U.S . origin, are handled as regulated garbage. 5802 VOYAGE OUTSIDE TERRITORIAL LIMITS AND RETURN When no foreign or United States offshore ports were visited, ships moving between coastal ports within the United States or between continental United States and Alaskan ports shall not be subject to boarding by the DHS -CBP-AI inspector . These ships are not required to adhere to NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 5-56garbage requirements unless the ship was issued meat, not of U.S . origin, from a secure Navy stock point (discussed in the paragraph below ). 5803 SPECIAL PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING MEAT CARRIED AS CARGO ABOARD U.S. MILITARY VESSELS RETURNING FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES 1.MEAT INSPECTION . The DHS -CBP-AI inspector shall inspect and supervise the movement for handling meat that may have been stored at U.S . Military Depots in foreign/affected countries or stored on ships that have made port calls in foreign/affected countries and carried as cargo aboard U.S . Military vessels returning from foreign countries . . a.End Use Ships (ships other than CLF ships) . The handling of meat for end use ships other than CLF ships is discussed below.(1) Meat of U.S . Origin. All unopened cartons that are marked as a product of the United States shall be released without any restriction by the DHS -CBP-AI inspector. (2) Meat, Not of U.S . Origin . This type of meat may be transferred using refrigeration units, from one U.S . Military vessel to another (controlled cross -decking), put in secure, sealed storage for re -issue to outbound ships only, or destroyed under the supervision of the DHS -CBP-AI inspector . Consumption of meat not of U.S . origin by outbound vessels is not authorized until the outbound ship has departed from the United States . Meat not of U.S. origin transferred to a secure storage site shall not be used for consumption ashore. NOTE: If meat not of U.S. origin has been cross -decked to another vessel, the DHS -CBP-AI inspector shall document this transfer on the Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) Form 288, by writing \"Meat or meat products transferred, foreign meat/meat products aboard.\" The DHS -CBP-AI inspector shall advise the Commanding Officer to retain the form until the vessel returns to the United States. NOTE: A U.S . Army Veterinary Inspector may be requested to assist the DHS - CBP-AI inspector in documenting the transfer of meat not of U.S . origin from secure storage to outbound ships only by writing \"Meat transferred, foreign meataboard\" and advis ing the Captain to retain a copy of the transfer document until the vessel returns to the United States . b.CLF Ships and Overseas Stock Points . Meat of U.S . origin carried and stored as cargo for underway replenishment or off -loaded at overseas facilities (that is then transshipped back into the United States ) is permitted entry back into the United States for issue to ashore dining facilities under the following conditions: Products are in their original unopened cartons . Cartons are identified/marked as a product of the United States . 2.US DA REGULATIONS FOR INTRODUCTION OF FOREIGN FOODS . OPNAVINST 6210.2 (series) and OPNAV M -5090.1D provide guidance for conformance with regulations of the United States Departments of Health and Human Services, Agriculture, Homeland Security, and Commerce . These regulations prevent the introduction and spread of human, plant , and animal diseases and of insects and pests of health and agricultural importance. Introduction of these into the U.S . and its territories may occur by movements of Navy ships, aircraft, or other transport arriving at military installations, ports, or facilities in the U.S . and may cause millions of dollars in irreversible damage to U.S. agriculture. a.Policy . Navy vessels shall totally consume all fruits, vegetables, and meat that have been grown, produced, or processed outside the U.S., transfer such products to an outbound vessel before docking, or otherwise dispose of it as waste beyond 25 N autical Miles from U.S . shores . . When docking in the first U.S. port or U.S . territory, garbage contaminated with foreign -source food, including all plastic disks from plastic waste processors on ships or submarines , shall be retained on board, treated as foreignNAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 5-57regulated garbage, and disposed of ashore by USDA -approved methods outlined in NAVSUP P- 486 and the USDA Manual for Agricultural Clearance. NOTE: Food stores are required to be properly marked/identified with USDA labels; otherwise, food items not labeled shall be designated as Regulated Garbage by U .S. Customs during their inspection. b.Disposition . Disposition shall be in a regulated garbage dumpster located in the direct vicinity of the ship/submarine. If there are no regulated foreign stores aboard the vessel, all food service garbage generated onboard within the first 24 hours in port shall be treated as regulated garbage; this includes food packing plastic and cardboard . Regulated garbage shall be bagged in 3- mil (0.003- inch thick) plastic bags and shall be labeled with the words \"Regulated Garbage\" before placing in the regulated garbage dumpster . The label shall be clearly legible and must adhere to the bag. Each command shall track the number of regulated garbage bags disposed of using local/reg ion tracking forms . After the first 24 hours, food service garbage produced onboard is not regulated and no further administrative action is required . The instructions given above do not preclude discharge of any solid waste in an emergency when failure to do so would clearly endanger the health or safety of shipboard personnel. 5804 H ANDLING REGULATED GARBAGE ABOARD U.S . MILITARY VESSELS 1.GARBAGE AND/ OR WASTE GUIDELINES. Federal Regulation 9CFR94.5 defines garbage as all waste material derived in whole or in part from fruits, vegetables, meats, or other plant oranimal (including poultry) material and other refuse of any character that has been associatedwith any such material on board any means of conveyance including food scraps, table refuse, galley refuse, food wrappers or packaging materials, plastic disks from plastic waste processors or plastic waste from ships or submarines, and other waste material from stores, food preparation areas, passengers' or crews' quarters, dining rooms, or any other areas on a means of conveyance. 2.GAR BAGE HANDLING . Garbage , from any Navy ship that has visited any foreign country , that was not disposed of beyond 25 N autical Miles from U.S . shores shall be handled a s described below. a.The 24- Hour Rule . If there are no foreign stores aboard the vessel all garbage aboard the vessel at docking and all garbage produced during the first 24 hours shall besterilized or incinerated . Once the garbage is incinerated or sterilized at the first U.S. port, no further action is required at subsequent U.S. ports . b.Disposition. Garbage shall be placed in leak -proof, covered containers and disposed of following port procedures authorized by, or under surveillance of, the DHS -CBP-AI representative. c.Garbage Aboard. If regulated foreign stores are present and are not purged or transferred to an outbound vessel before docking, all garbage aboard shall be treated as foreign and shall be required to be sterilized or incinerated. If foreign stores are present, the DHS -CBP-AI inspector shall not apply the 24- hour rule. Once the foreign stores are used up or otherwise disposed of, the 24- hour rule shall apply . Until those stores are used up or disposed of, the DHS -CBP-AI inspector shall continue to regulate the ship's garbage as any other foreign vessel. NOTE: I f foreign stores are present and we re, purged or transferred to another vessel, the DHS -CBP-AI inspector shall document this purging or transfer on the PPQ Form 288. The DHS -CBP-AI inspector shall annotate in writing, \"Purged or transferred, now Domestic.\" The DHS -CBP-AI inspector shall then advise the Commanding Officer to retain the form as proof of Domestic status until the vessel departs from the mainland.

In Navy terms, \"survey\" means a report on the \"disposition of material\" after a situation has been investigated. The survey procedure is the means by which material that is damaged, obsolete, deteriorated, lost, stolen, is expended from accounting records . Under no circumstances shall food deemed fit for consumption be destroyed and/or surveyed. The following two methods are used for surveys: Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss (DD Form 200) Expenditure Log (Loss Without Survey) (NAVSUP Form 1334) NOTE: Inventory adjustments caused by clerical errors are never surveyed. 2.OU TDATED FOOD ITEMS . Outdated food items may or may not be fit for human consumption. Outdated status alone does not warrant the disposal of food. Food should only be disposed of if it is determined to be unfit for human consumption. If outdated food items are suspected to be defective, an authorized medical representative and/or Army Veterinarian Inspector (AVI) must inspect these items . In the event an A VI is not available, an authorized medical representative must inspect the item(s) to determine their disposition. For food items determined unfit for human consumption, a written statement ( MEDCOM Form 817 Quality Assurance Representatives Correspondence) explaining the dispositi on of the inspected food items must accompany the loss claim ( DD Form 200 Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss or NAVSUP Form 1334 Expenditure Log, Loss Without Survey) . DA Form 7538 (Subsistence Serviceability Certificate) also must be provided with the claim to substantiate the determination of the disposed foods . DA Form 7538 requires the signature of the Quality Assurance Inspector , the Medical Representative, and/or the AVI before submission. 3.REP ORTING TO NAVSUP . When the total value of all survey s (NAVSUP Form 1334 and/or DD Form 200s) exceeds $5,000 on a monthly basis, a copy of both forms must be forwarded monthly to the TYCOM for review . NAVSUP N432 tracks significant survey actions caused by the impact on the SIK budget . When warranted, NAVSUP N432 consults with the Type Commanders (TYCOM s) and Fleet Logistics Centers ( FLCs ) to ensure that adequate controls are in place to prevent continued losses. 4.SUR VEYS RESULTING FROM LATENT DEFECTS OF PRIME VENDOR SUPPLIED ITEMS. Items supplied by PVs that have latent defects must not be surveyed until the PV (PV) or FLC has been contacted for replacement and product disposition. Every attempt must be made to store the items at the appropriate temperature(s) until the PV can replace them . If the PV does not replace (or provide credit for ) the items with latent defects, the receiving activity shall complete an SF 364 and forward it to Defense Logistics Agency - Troop Support ( DLA-TS). Pr oducts with latent defects that ar e not replaced by the PV shall not be surveyed and destroyed until DLA-TS provides disposition guidance. When DLA-TS advise s that products should be surveyed, the survey shall be annotated with \"PRIME VENDOR UNRESOLVED LATENT DEFECT \", and a copy shall be forwarded to NAVSUP N432. In the case of Hazardous Food Recalls requiring the survey of PV supplied items, the survey form shall be annotated with the ALFOODACT and shall include the number of the recall authorizing the survey action. Regardless of the dollar value, all losses involving PV defects and/or ALFOODACTS shall be reported to NAVSUP by f orward ing a copy of the SF 364 and DD 200 to NAVSUP N432.NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 6-3a.Disposal at Sea. Ships are authorized to destroy or dispose of recalled products us ing DD For m 200 to remov e items from inventory .

D ocumentation for the number of pounds and cases, and any additional pertinent information , must be maintained and signed by the Accountable Officer as required to r ecoup the cost of the product for the government . Providing pictures of manufacturer information , lot numbers, dates, and other pertinent information is highly recommended . U pon completion, a copy of SF 364 and DD Form 200 must be forwarded to the supporting NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center (NAVSUP FLC) and a copy must be furnished to NAVSU P 432 v ia navsup_foodservice@navy. mil. The supporting NAVSUP FLC will forward the documents to the Account Manager at DLA Troop Support for credit resolution. These forms must include the number of the recall authorizing the survey action. The PV must submit a credit invoice to the Acco unt Manager at DLA Troop Support. b.Disposal for Ships Inport/Homeported and for Ashore Galleys . The appropriate DLA Account Manager via Regional NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center (NAVSUP FLC) shall be contacted to arrange pickup of recalled items . If the vendor refuses to pick up products, the supporting (NAVSUP FLC) must be contacted for further guidance. Commands will prepare SF 364 to support the DD Form 200 before removing items from inventory . The g uidance applies from this point forward . 5.F INANCIAL LIABILITY INVESTIGATION OF PROPERTY LOSS (DD FORM 200) . DD Fo rm 200 shall be prepared immediately under the following conditions: There is not a sufficient quantity of m aterial , or the material has been lost in shipment (regardless of the value) . A copy of the survey shall be provided to supplying activ ities (DLA/Stores/MSC and NAVSUP N43 2). There is a Ships Schedule Change requiring the survey of food. TYCOM must be notifi ed and appr ove before the survey. Ref er to P aragraph 5208 for Ships Schedule Change . T here is evidence of lack of personal responsibility such as the following: oNegligence oWillful misconduct oDeliberate unauthorized use oDeliberate noncompliance with appropriate procedures that protect U.S . Government property There is evidence or suspicion of fraud or theft . The survey is requested by the accountable officer, the CO (CO), or the CO's designee . W hen c ircumstances such as physical deterioration (expired/spoiled) , veterinary sampling, damage in handling (crushe d/broken) , flood, or fire result in a total loss of $ 500 or greater per National Stock Number ( NSN) per month ($1,000 for CVN/LCC/LHA/LHD/LPD/LSD) . Items are part of the Donation Program ( see P aragraph 6500) . 6.EX PENDITURE LOG (LOSS WITHOUT SURVEY) (NAVSUP FOR M 1334) . In earlier versions of the Food Service Management (FSM) system DD Form 200 is used for losses without survey . B lock 2 of the Form shall be annotated with NS 1334 when generating from the FSM system afloat. NAVSUP Form 1334 may be used for d ivisional training and to expend loss of damaged, deterioration, and vet sampling of food items when culpable responsibility is not involved and when the conditions discussed below apply.NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 6-4a. Loss . Food items are lost as a result of circumstances such as physical deterioration (expired/spoiled) , veterinary sampling, damaged in handling (broken/crushed) ; the value of the loss is less than $500 per NSN and does not exceed a cumulative value of $1, 000 monthly per NSN . If the cumulative loss exceeds $1, 000 for the month a letter of justification must be sent to TYCOM or to the Regional Commander. b.Loss Total . When the total loss of all items expended in the circumstances listed above on the same day exceeds $500 ($1,0 00 for CVN/LCC/LHA/LHD/LPD/LSD) , DD Form 200 shall be completed as required. Repetitive entries of the same item for the purpose of circumventing maximum dollar limitations are not allowed . c.Expended Food Items . When expended foods items on NAVSUP Form 1334 (loss per NSN line item) meet the maximum dollar value limitations for each NSN or the total allowance for the month; all future losses for that item must be expended through a DD Form 200 survey. d. Food Items with Multiple NSNs . Food items with multiple NSNs are used for divisional training, not to exceed a total dollar value of $200.00 per month . All food items used for training shall be entered on NAVSUP Form 1334 as a separate single line entry . The training must be documented in the General Mess training program. NO TE: Later versions of t he FSM system give a warning when the $500 or $10 00 thresholds are exceeded and will prevent adding additional data. A pplicable justification must be submitted to TYCOM or to the Regi onal Commander. 6001 FINANCIAL LIABILITY INVESTIGATION OF PROPERTY LOSS (DD FORM 200) PROCEDURES 1.GENERAL . Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss (DD Form 200) provides a report for administrative review of the fol lowing: The loss or damage of material . The cause of the loss or damage.

There are two types of transfers : a transfer without reimbursement and a transfer with reimbursement . A transfer without reimbursement means the subsistence appropriation has already bought the food and there will be no additional obligation to the subsistence appropriation when the food is transferred. A transfer with reimbursement means there will be a reimbursement to the subsistence appropriation for the food that is being transferred. 2.TRA NSFERS WITHOUT REIMBURSEMENT . When regularly established supply channels are not available, a re quest for transfer (instead of a sale) of food items from one Navy GM (end user) to another Navy GM may occur . This includes transfers to Navy ashore/afloat galleys and to approved established messes such as SEABEE to ASHORE, USS SHIP to USS SHIP, USS SHIP TO SHORE . 3.TRA NSFERS WITH REIMBURSEMENT . Transfer of food items to activities that do not use the Navy subsistence appropriation (that is, activities that are not Navy GMs using the subsistence appropriation), are treated as transfers with reimbursem ent. A transfer with reimbursement means that the subsistence appropriation has already purchased the food that is now being transferred to an activity that uses another appropriation such as a Naval Hospital other Military Branches. Tr ansfers with reimbursement should not be confused with sale of bulk food items . Sale of bulk food items involves an exchange of money through use of a check, cash, or line of Accounting . Sales of food items shall be processed in accordance with Paragraph 6302. 4.OT HER SUP PLY OFFICER (OSO) TRANSFERS. When circumstances arise that a ship requires another ship within the same AOR to place a food order for required provisions the ship placing the order will use the normal requisitioning procedures . When food arrives as a transfer w/o reimbursement (OSO transfer) the provision transfer will be completed using the DD Form 1149 as the receipt document . 5.TR ANSFER- IN AND TRANSFER- OUT . The transfer -out of food items from stock records and transfer -in of the same food items to stock records to correct erroneous posting or inventory problems is prohibited without NAVSUP N432 approval . Guidance for the completion of the DD Form 1149 is available from the local Navy Food Management Team (NFMT) . 6201 T RANSFER DOCUMENT USED 1.GENERAL .

Delay in loading , issuing , and inventory ing boxed meats and cheese is decreased by handling these items on an average weight basis . These procedures are provided primarily for the activities that may find it practical to inventory and to expend perishable boxed meats and cheese by average weight . The Purchase Ration Factor (PRF) and the Catch Weight Multiple (CWM) are discussed below. a.Purchase Ratio Factor . The PRF is the industry standard for a case quantity (that is, most #10 cans come 6 cans to a case so the PRF is 6 ). b.Catch Weight Multiple. Because items such as pork loin and beef roast have no standard weight , vendors have a catch weight average for each case. The box weight is limited to head space in the box and OSHA standards for a human to lift . Most catch weight cases are between 40 and 60 pounds. Th e requisitioner must enter quantities in multiples of the Purchase Ratio Factor (PRF) or Catch Weight Multiple (CWM) in the FSM system . FSM system users must validate the ordering quantity that supports the PRF (case load) before approval . Catch Weight Items must be ordered by the catch weight that the vendor provides and must be loaded as part of the catalog in the FSM system . PRF and CWM are the same to the user when ordering as they can see the multiple to use when ordering in the order area within the FSM system . At the time of receipt the number of pounds delivered (CWM) and number of cans (PRF) must be entered in the FSM system . 2.AVERAG E WEIGHT DETERMINATION . An equitable system for handling boxed meats and cheese on an average net case weight basis depends on careful separation of stock into lotswhere the weight differentials between the lightest and heaviest cases are within acceptable limits . Judgment shal l be used in doubtful instances . The average net case weight shall be determined for each lot and rounded off to the nearest whole pound. 3.TR ANSFERS AND ISSUES. Invoices covering transfers by average weight shall indicate the number of cases in the lot, the total average weight, and the average net case weight . A separate invoice line shall be used for each lot in multiple lot transfers of a particular item. Wh en issuing, the first case issued generally is the case that absorbs the difference between actual and average case weight . For example, when there are 10 cases at 50 pounds each with a receipt of 502 pounds . 4.GAI NS AND LOSSES. Gains and losses from the receipt of items on an average weight basis shall be absorbed as issues to the GM. 6205 P OSTING TO THE SUBSISTENCE LEDGER (NAVSUP FORM 335) All transfers, with or without reimbursement , are posted by quantity on the Subsistence Ledger (NAVSUP Form 335) to the \"Expenditures Other\" column automatically in FSM as the transactions occur (Figure 6 -9 and Figure 6-12). 6206 POSTING TO THE RECORD OF RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES (NAVSUP FORM 367) All transfers, with or without reimbursement, are posted automatically by total money value and document number to the Record of Receipts and Expenditures (NAVSUP Form 367) in FSM as the transactions occur .

NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 7-32PART B: INVENTORY 7100 GEN ERAL INFORMATION 1.APPLICABILITY. The procedures in this section apply to all GMs . Performing accurate and timely inventories is one of the most critical responsibilities of the FSO . Physical inventories provide the foundation to support recordkeeping closeouts and submission of GM returns. 2.DEF INITION . A physical inventory is a process of identifying, counting, and evaluating all subsistence on hand at a specified time . 3.PURPO SE. A physical inventory is taken for the following purposes : To establish and reestablish financial accountability and responsibility To determine the dollar value of the subsistence on hand so that the required financial reports can be prepared To check on the accuracy of subsistence ledgers and to adjust any differences that mayexist between the subsistence ledgers and the subsistence on hand. To determine the dollar value of subsistence shortages caused by spoilage, damage,waste, pilferage, or other losses not reflected on subsistence ledgers. To identify subsistence shortages and overages and to determine financial liability. To serve as a management tool for subsistence inventory controls. 4.INVEN TORY LEVELS. Afloat and ashore commands must constantly ensure that inventory levels maintain current TYCOM/Regional Galley Program Manager -approved endurance levels as discussed below. a.Afloat . Based on TYCOM endurance level guidance and knowledge of future operations. b. Ashore. Maintain no more than seven to ten days inventory on hand. Exceptions for circumstances such as natural disasters must be approved through CNIC. c.Inventory Level Priorities . Maintaining the following good inventory practices throughout the month reduces inventory issues : Use first -in/first -out inventory management system. Determine food ordering requirements from past crew consumption, acceptabilitypatterns, and item cost. Reduc e inventory levels before entry into shipyard/overhaul periods by adjusting menus to reduce on- board stocks. Transfer excess stock to other activities sufficiently in advance of food expiration. Request assistance from TYCOM. 5.COMP LETION OF INVENTORIES . A full physical subsistence inventory shall be performed as follows: Upon relief of the accountable FSO. Upon relief of the responsible Bulk Storeroom Custodian. Within 90 days of the last full physical inventory (see Figure 7 -21). It is highly recommended that the last quarterly inventory be conducted in the month of September . NOTE: Spot inventories must be maintained to avoid inventory adjustments for overissues when conducting quarterly inventories. When there is evidence of unauthorized entry into that storeroom. Within 45 days of decommissioning. At any other time when directed by the Type Commander, Major Claimant, CO, SupplyOfficer, or FSO.NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 7-33 Figure 7-21 NAVSUP Form 1359 Recording Data for the Last Full Inventory on the General Mess Summary Document Date of last full inventory (inventory is required every 90 days). Inventory accuracy rate is based on the last full inventory conducted. NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 7-346.INVE NTORY ADJUSTMENTS . The four types of inventory adjustments are discussed below . a. Loss from Inventory . This results when the number of items on hand, counted during a physical inventory , is less than the number of items listed in NAV SUP Form 335, Subsistence Ledger . This shortage must be investigated by the LCS or FSO. b. Gain from Inventory . This results when the number of items on hand, counted during a physical inventory , is more than the number of items listed in NAVSUP Form 335, Subsistence Ledger . This excess must be investigated by the LCS or FSO. c.Net Inventory Adjustment . The Net Inventory Adjustment is the dollar value of the inventory after subtracting the Loss by inventory (+) from the Gained by inventory values (-). Example: if the command inventory adjusted $10,000 as a Gained by inventory ( -) and $6,500 as a Loss by inventory (+) the Net Inventory Adjustment shall equal a gain of $3,500 ( -). d.Gross Inventory Adjustment . The Gross Inventory Adjustment is all adjustments, whether positive or negative, calculated as an absolute value. Example: $10,000 Gained By Inventory ( -), $6,500 Loss By Inventory (+) = a Gross Inventory absolute value of $16,500. 7101 INVENTO RY MANAGEMENT 1.GENERAL. FSOs shall be expected to maintain an inventory validity of at least 95 percent. Loss of is sue, receipt and expenditure doc uments, and incorrect records posting shall impede the ability to meet the 95 percent accuracy goal. Paying attention to the storerooms shall provide signific ant div idends on the time invested. A difference in book balances and the actual count during an inventory may be the difference between being over or under issue. Various checks and balances may be used to maintain control of inventory accuracy. Additional information is discussed below. a.Inventory Management. The FSO is required to implement an effective inventory management plan in accordance with TYCOM guidance. This procedure is used when the FSO conducts spot inventories of subsistence items in the bulk storeroom at unannounced times during the course of the monthly ac counting period. A minimum of 10 percent of subsistence line items maintained in the bulk storeroom shall be inventoried twice a month or 20 perc ent monthly (Food Service Officer's decision based on needed inventory accuracy controls). Spot inventories must concentrate on high value and fast moving items. The results shall be compared to the Subsistence Ledgers (NAVSUP Forms 335) to ensure that the inventory accuracy of the bulk storeroom is maintained. The spot inventory needs to be signed by the FSO and placed in the FSO's non- accountability file for 3 years. Refer to the local TYCOM guidance for any additional and or increased levels of s pot inventory requirements not outlined in this paragraph. b.Full Physical Inventories. This procedure is used when the FSO conducts a full quarterly inventory of all subsistence items ev ery 90 day s. The results shall be compared Subsistence Ledgers (NAVSUP Forms 335) with appropriate adjusting entries made. Because of operational risks, COMSUBFOR is authorized to exempt deployed submarines from quarterly inventories. Within 45 days of initial return to homeport, a full inventory must be conducted and results must be reported to TYCOM via the ISIC. Cauti on must be exerc ised with this procedure when like subsistence items are located in multiple locations. c.Breakout/Perpetual Inventories. This procedure is used when the Bulk Store room Custo dian inv entories the remaining subsis tence items after each breakout or issue is made. The Bulk Store room Custo dian shall indicate the balance on hand on each Food Item Request/Issue Document (NAVSUP Form 1282) after making each breakout or issue. The Recor dskeeper shall compare this balance after decreasing the break out or NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 7-35i ssue on the Subsistence Ledger (NAVSUP Form 335) . Differences shall be examined and appropriate entries made. d. Emergency Breakout Procedures . Emergency breakout procedures must be developed and approved by the FSO to ensure that proper inventory is maintained. e.Inventory Priorities. A full inventory conducted in a week that a spot inventory is required supersedes the need to conduct an additional spot inventory for that week. f.Inventory Discrepancies. Inadvertent inventory discrepancies (such as fat finger or posted wrong) shall be handled as a spot check the next day. g.Unforeseen Circumstances. Unforeseen circumstances ( such as e mergency leave or TAD) may cause the Food Service Officer (FSO) to be unav ailable to conduct designated inventories ( spot and/or full). The following procedures shall be followed: (1)FSO shall have a LOA on file designating a temporary replacement in their absence. (2)If the FSO is on shore duty, or operating a ship on FSM ashore mode there needs to be a NAVSUP approved SAAR form on file by NAVSUP designating the alternate role in block 11 of the SAAR form . A SAAR form needs to be completed and submitted when there is no SAAR form currently on file with an alternate role . The FSO shall take the following steps: Send an e- mail to navsup_bsc_fsm@navy.mil requesting the new role. Note: An approved SAAR must be on f ile with NAVSUP I nformation Assurance Officer . Follow all inventory procedures in accordance with P -486 Chapter 7, Paragraph 7100 and any other written procedures identified by the FSO when the alternate member assumes the temporary role as FSO . (3)When t he FSO returns , the previous designated role of the temporary relief will be reinstated. 7102 PREPARI NG FOR INVENTORIES 1.PREPARATION . Before the inventory all receipts, transfers, surveys, returns , and issues to the GM and other authorized messes must be up to date and posted with approval by the FSO . All receipt and expenditure (transfer, survey, sale, and issue) documents shall be posted to the following : Subsistence Ledgers (NAVSUP Form s 335) Record of Receipts and Expenditures (NAVSUP Form 367) All subsistence items shall be arranged to make counting easier. It is recommended that like items be together, neatly stacked, visible, and in food item code (FIC) sequence in each storeroom, where possible. 2.ASSIGNMENT OF PERSONNEL . Before turnover of the FSO position, the FSO and the relieving FSO are required to complete a full inventory . Personnel who are assigned responsibility for subsistence storage areas shall be present and participate in the inventory in their respective spaces . A two-team method (two teams, two or more per team) shall be used when possible. 7103 FULL PHY SICAL INVENTORY PROCEDURES 1.INVENTORY. Inventory procedures are discussed below. a.Recording the Inventory. The actual count of subsistence items will be recorded on the inventory worksheet (Figure 7-22) that has been generated and printed from FSM and be referred to as the rough inventory. Entries will be recorded in ink or permanent marker. Errors will be lined out and not blacked out or erased. All corrections will be initialed by the Food Service Officer. Each page of the rough inventory will be signed by all individuals participating in the inventory. It is also recommended that TYCOM be contacted for specific local requirements.NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 7-36b. Ac tions During the Inventory . The contents of boxes from which items have been removed shall always be counted. The FSO shall take the necessary action to ensure that no issue, transfer, or sale of subsistence items is made, except in an emergency, until the inventory has been reconciled. If an emergency breakout is made during the inventory, the inventory team shall be notified and their signatures shall be obtained on the breakout document. c.Actions After the Inventory Placed in Ini tiated Status in FSM (Reconciliation ). Item loss by inventory quantities are calculated as follows, Physical count of item (PI Quantity)divided by previous book inventory value (S ystem Quantity) equals line item validity. Item gain by inventory quantities (GBI), recorded as positive value as adjustments (gain). All quantity adjustments (gain or loss) with a line item validity of below 95 percent must be reconciled before placing the inventory into posted status. Changes to the inventory not permitted after placing inventory into the posted st atus. The Food Service Officer must place the inventory into accepted status, followed by generating and printing of thePhysical Inventory (PI) Discrepancy Report (1059) to be signed. (Figure 7- 23a, 7- 23b, and 7- 23c). Earlier versions of FSM, Food Service Officer accept the inventory followed by printing and signing all physical inventory view pages (Figure 7-2 6b). (1)If the inventory is correct, it may be posted at this time or when all discrepancies have been resolved. The inventory quantity shall be posted to the \"On Hand\" balance column. (2)If the inventory reveals unresolved discrepancies resulting in a shortage (the number of items on hand counted during a physical inventory is less than the number of items listed on NAVSUP Form 335, Subsistence Ledger) a loss f rom inventory has occurred and must be posted as shown below and in Figure 7- 24.

NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management A-15PART F: ENDURANCE MODULE D ETAILS 1500 FSM SYSTEM ENTRIES FOR ENDURANCE 1.AFLOAT ENDURANCE LEVELS CALCULATIONS. Afloat endurance levels calculations in the Food Service Management (FSM) System are based on use, acceptability, and crew size . To achieve afloat endurance levels the user must enter the following in the FSM System: Required Delivery Date (RDD) -- the date that the order will be received. Sustainment Days - The number of days to endure; the number of days from the RDD date that the ordered amount will last. Crew Size (Core or Embarked) -- the average size of the crew during the endurance period. This is a set number located and adjusted in the Activity (constants section of FSM). NOTE: C rew Size (Embarked) sum of Crew Size (Core) plus Crew Size (Embarked) . Adjustments to Crew Size (Core and Embarked) maintained in FSM Manage Activity, Activity Information, FSM/Activity Settings . Before calculating endurance levels the Crew Size (Core or Embarked) must be updated. 2.DEFI NITIONS FOR UNDERSTANDING AFLOAT ENDURANCE LEVELS . The following definitions will aid in understanding afloat endurance levels: On-Hand Balance. The current on- hand balance of the Food Item Code (FIC) on the day the endurance report is run. Eat-Down A mount . The amount of the FIC that will be used (based on menu, crew size, and acceptability) from the day that the endurance report is run until the endurance RDD. Due-In Amount . The amount of the FIC already on order with RDDs that precede the endurance RDD. On-Hand RDD Amount . The amount of the FIC that will be on hand on the endurance RDD date. On-Hand RDD Amount . The on- hand balance minus the eat -down amount plus the due- in amount . This amount must never be less than zero. The formula for the On -Hand RDD Amount is as follows: The on- hand balance divided by the eat -down amount plus the due- in amount . This amount shall never be less than zero. Endurance Amount . The amount of the FIC that will be used on the RDD date plus the number of Endurance Days . This is based on menu, crew size, and acceptability Ordered Amount . This is the endurance amount minus the On -hand RDD Amount . The ordered amount is limited by shelf life, maximum pound limit, high limit, and Unit of issue (UI) limit. 3.SUST AINABILITY (AUTOMATIC ORDERING ENDURANCE CALCULATION) . The calculations discussed below are used for sustainability. a.Determining Category R eport Field - Manage FIC Search . Select each category followed by Search, resulting in FIC record s found (set by TYCOM) . FIC Category Descriptions -Records Found Chill (Ham, Cheese , and Yogurt) - 46 Bag In a Box Items - 21 Meat Items in Dry Storeroom - 15 Subsistence items not in Dry (BIB, Meat, Starch or Vegetables) - 186 Rice, Pasta Etc . - 15 Canned, Dehydrated and Dry Beans - 28NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management A-16All Eggs, Fresh, Frozen & Chill - 11 Fresh Fruits and Vegetables - 77 Frozen Meat, Cheese and Vegetarian Entrees (No Crab legs, Cornish Hen or Lobster Included) - 195 Frozen Items NOT Meat or Vegetables - 49 Frozen Vegetables - 36 Milk (Fresh/UHT/ESL) - 24 Non-Sustainment (Bread, Desserts & Condiments) - 486 MREs & UGRs - 93 b.Determining \"Pounds in Inventory \" - Total Current On Hand Balance of each FIC per sustainability category multiplied by book inventory conversion Factor . D ivide by sustainability \"Serving size (LBS) \". Note: Serving size (LBS) set by NAVSU P H Q (Jen/USDA) in Manage FIC Category. Divide by Crew Size provided by Activity at time of needed report Run. Note: Ensure all users of FSM use same crew size . N ote: (1) Before running report, determine the last calendar date expenditures were posted (Issue, Losses, Transfers, and Bulk sales . (2) Determine last calendar date posted status for expenditures was received. T he result per the Sustainability Category equals \"Sustainability Days\".

It is essential that all Department of the Navy personnel adhere to the highest standards of integrity and ethical conduct . Speci al occasions such as Change of Command, hosting dignitaries , and special Command functions require special planning . MILPERSMAN 1800 -010 provides general guidelines for conducting ceremonies for retirement or transfer to the fleet reserve. The following Change of Command and Ceremony Resources provide more information: Office of the Judge Advocate General, Code 13, Standards of Conduct and Government Ethics Branch, Ethics Gram 16- 02 (12 Dec 2016) provides guidance required for Change of Command and Retire ment Activities.

DOD Standards of Conduct : https://ogc.osd.mil/defense_ethics/resource_library/employee_guide.pdf 2.O FFICIAL AND UNOFFICIAL FUNCTIONS . Appropriated funds and on- duty Command personnel may be employed only to support official functions . Change of Command ceremonies and Command- sponsored retirement ceremonies are examples of official functions . Th e r eceptions that follow these functions, however, generally are not official . One exception, if requested in advance, is when a change of Command reception is intended to provide an oppor tunity for the incoming Commander to meet ORF- eligible individuals pursuant to SECNAVINST 7042.7K. Private funds and privately funded food service support must be used when the function is deemed unofficial. The appropriate Staff Judge Advocat e or Office of General Counsel attorney must be consulted early in the planning process of any event for furtherguidance on when a function may be deemed official. 3.U SE OF MILITARY PERSONNEL . Military personnel may be required to support events that are deemed official, such as C hanges of C ommand and C ommand- sponsored retirement ceremonies . To support the unofficial receptions that often follow these ceremonies, it is recommended that the member(s) hosting the reception seek a private entity such as a c ommercial caterer or a Moral Welfare and Recreation (MWR) facility to perform staffin g f unctions . The member(s) hosting the reception may choose to hire enlisted personnel on a strictly voluntary basis to support unofficial receptions in an off -duty (leave or regular liberty status ). Their official duties shall not be scheduled or adjusted to accommodate unofficial events . P ayment for off -duty enlisted personnel must be commensurate with, or above, the fair market value of work performed in accordance with the Bureau of Labor Statistics website atwww.bls.gov . Clear documentation of the fair market wage must be retained by the member(s)NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management E-3hosting the reception. If this staffing option is used, the terms of employment shall be formalized in a written agreement . CS personnel shall not be used to support unofficial receptions without pay ashore or afloat on military vessels . 1001 OFFICIAL REPRESENTATION FUNDS (ORF s) 1.INTRODUCTION . Official Representation Funds ( ORF s) are to be used only to maintain the standing and prestige of the United States . A detailed listing of obligations or expenditures in which ORF may not be used is contained in this I nstruction. The use of Subsistence- In-Kind appropriation to fund or offset the cost of ORF functions is prohibited. Guidelines for use of ORFs are contained in SECNAVINST 7042.7K . These guidelines includes the following: Officials who are eligible for official ORF funded courtesies on an official visit to the field . Scope of functions including the size, cost, and number of guests invited. Hosting official functions and the presentation of Command mementos . Procedures for requesting funds or exceptions . Sample expense documentation sheet and vouchers . Suppl y Officer s (SUPPOs) afloat have the opportunity to host Distinguished Visitors (DV s) onboard. Depending on the specific criteria and requirements set by the Type Commander, SUPPOs m ay be eligible to receive Official Representation Funds (ORFs ) to support such events. Th e use of ORFs requires additional coordination between the Disbursing Officer (DO), Food Service Officer (FSO), and Sales Officer . Understanding the process and the nuances of the situation is the key to ensuring a successful evolution. The integrated reporting guidelines, listed in Section 2 (Official Representation Fund (ORF) Guidelines) and in Section B (General FSM Guidelines for Processing ORF Funded Transactions). 2.GUIDELINES. When the ship sponsors a special event, the Co mmand may receive ORFs under a s pecial Line of Accounting (LOA) to reimburse the mess (general or private) for expenses incurred for hosting the event. A request for ORFs must be routed through the Chain of Command and must be su bmitted in writing to the appropriate entity responsible for approving and/o r providing the funds (these entities always must be contacted for their specific requirements and for a list of common errors and/o r discrepancies). A request generally shall include the following: A description of the proposed use of funds (include the draft of the recommended menu and DD Form 1149 - Requisitioning and Invoice Shipping Document). A justification of why the expenditures merit the use of ORFs. An explanation of why other funds cannot be used. The date and location of the event. The c ost of the event and/or memento, including a description of items to be purchase with ORF s. A complete lis t of DoD guests with ranks and present billets (include the names, ranks, titles, and organization). A complete list of authorized guests entitled to ORF courtesies (include the names, ranks, titles, and organization). 3.OFFICIAL FUNCTIONS. Military personnel may be detailed to duty at official functions , official ceremonies, and official receptions financed by ORFs. These assignments must be considered regular military duty; duty hours and liberty times of affected military personnel shall be adjusted accordingly.NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management E-44.ORF REIMBURSEMENT .

This guide is a tool used to assess the serviceability of subsistence inventory while ashore or afloat. R eceiving, storing, and issuing only serviceable, wholesome product must be conducted in an efficient and reliable manner. Ensuring the health and welfare of personnel and protecting the financial interest of the government are the responsibilities of each person in the supply chain. T he U.S. Army Veterinary Services has the mission for providing food safety and quality assurance oversight, including wholesomeness, for the Department of Defense; however, veterinary support may not be available or practical at all times. Inspections covering contract quality assurance provisions such as age on delivery, Berry Amendment, shelf life remaining, pallet sizes, and minimum headspace in cases will not be performed routinely by the Army Veterinary Services. Inspection personnel generally will focus their receipt inspections on food protection factors such as wholesomeness, temperatures, condition, food defense, approved sources, and infestation. This guide does not relieve the Supply Officer (SUPPO) of the responsibility of contacting the U.S. Army Veterinary Service (while in port) or the ship's Medical Department Representative (MDR) (while at sea). This guide provides information for the U.S. Navy Supply Officer, in port or at sea, for assessing quality and any suspect wholesomeness and for determining the appropriate disposition of subsistence based on those factors.

The following are nonconforming items: Products that deviate from contractual compliance must be retur ned. Use the Report of Discrepancy (ROD) SF 364 and email to NAVSUP_FOODSERVICE@NAVY.MIL The reason that the I tems are returned must be noted on the manifest . Request s for replacement s must be made through the supporting Fleet Logistics Center ( FLC) offic e. 1002 PR OPER FOOD STORAGE PRACTICES 1.GENERAL . This Section describes storage practices that will ensure maximum protection of subsistence items . This Section covers the following four topics: general guidelines for all items; semi -perishables; products subject to infestation; and perishables . a.General Guidelines for All Items . General guidelines are discussed below. 1) Store All Subsistence Items . Subsistence items shall be stored as follows: Store i n regular storage areas that are clean, tidy , and well ventilated. Store i n an orderly manner at least six inches off the deck and on clean shelves, grates, racks, or pallets for proper air circulation. Arranged in proper order for FIFO stock rotation . Stocking should start from the bulkhead and work inward toward the center, starting 24\" in from the bulkheads or coils . Place items with the newest packing date on the bottom or in back of older items . On smaller ships and submarines stock rotation may be contingent on space constraints.NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management F-4Avoid cross -contamination. Items that might leak or drip must be stored below other items. Items that have been removed from their original containers must be stored In clean, covered, labeled, and dated containers. 2)Do Not Store. Do not store subsist ence under the following circumstances: Where there are possible sources of contamination such as unprotected sewage lines (Collection, Holding, or Transfer) and water lines or refrigeration lines with visible condensation. Near sources of heat ( heat reduc es the shelf life of the product). In heads, garbage rooms, salvage areas, or mechanical equipment rooms. Directly on the deck. b.Semi- Perishables . Semi -perishables are food items that do not require refrigeration. They are considered shelf -stable . Semi -perishable items generally are classified as either not subject to infestation (they are canned, jarred, or otherwise protected ) or subject to infestation. Even items that are not subject to infestation may spoil if they are improperly stored, mishandled, or stored too long. Semi -perishable subsistence should be inspected regularly to detect any evidence of damage, spoilage, and infestation. This includes Ultra High Temperature ( UHT) dairy and other shelf -stable items based on the type of packaging. Shelf life and storage considerations are discussed below. 1)Shelf life for semi -perishable commodities is based on the manufacturer 's established shelf life not on the date of receipt . Shelf life may be affected significantly by such elements as humidity, temperature, handling, and packaging. Subsistence items that have been on hand up to the limit of its shelf life should be consumed as soon as possible. Subsistence items that have exceeded their recommended Inspection Test Date (ITD) should be inspected carefully for spoilage,leakage, or other damage . If these items are determined to be serviceable, they should be issued as soon as possible; they will be given priority over newer stock. 2)Storage areas for semi -perishables must comply with the following Be cool. Be dry. Have low humidity levels . Be w ell ventilated. Be inspected regularly for insects and rodents . Te mperature checks must be conducted twice a day for all perishable storage locations (bulk refrigerators and freezers). Produc ts must be kept off the deck using grates so that products keep dry and promote air circulation . NOTE: H igh humidity is detrimental: it accelerates the growth of bacteria and molds , it promotes insect infestation, and it caus es mustiness in dry items such as flour or rice. The desirable relative humidity is between 40 percent and 50 percent . Dehydrated products are subject to moisture absorption, insect infestation, and mold. Tea will absorb odors, and high humidity causes it to become musty and sour . Flour and c ereals will absorb odors and shall be kept away from subsistence or material s that give off distinctive odors. c.Products Subject To Infestation. Many semi -perishable subsistence items are susceptible to infestation by insects and other pests . Insects can cause damage to fresh and processed food items . Subsistence items stored at temperatures betweenNAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management F-560\u00b0F to 90\u00b0F are especially attractive to insects . Constant monitoring is essential to prevent any infestation. Glue boards and traps should be used and checked daily . Contact the MDR when rodent infestations are suspected,. d. Perishables . All chilled and frozen subsistence items are highly perishable and subject to rapid deterioration when improperly stored. The following Guidelines are for perishable foods : Perishable subsistence items must be kept and/or stored at the manufacturer's recommended temperatures . Inadequate air circulation and humidity increase the deterioration of perishable products . Products should be stored at least two feet away from the bulkhead. Freezing maintains quality and lengthens the shelf life of a product, but it does NOT provide for indefinite shelf life . Products continue to deteriorate while in the frozen state . It is important when dealing with frozen items to maintain proper temperatures and to follow proper stock rotation procedures . The ability to identify stressed food products may prevent the issuing and/or consumption of unserviceable or unwholesome products . Signs of compromise d frozen food safety and quality include: oCondensation in the freezer room indicating a malfunctioning or inoperable freezer unit oExcessive ice build- up on the freezer unit oExcessive amount of liquid or ice found in the corners of cases oWet packaging oOdors not associated with the product Freezer breakdowns are the most common problem associated with product loss . A refrigeration failure report shall be filled out for all freezer breakdowns. See figure F - 3 below . The following will help control or prevent refrigeration failure: oMaintain proper temperature logs . Temperature check s must be conducted twice a day for all perishable storage locations (bulk refrigerators and freezers). oTemperature monitoring must be conducted at designated intervals inside the freezer ; outside thermometers must also be read . oCheck doors and seals for complete closure . Keep doors closed. oCheck thermometers ' accura cy. oDo not stack commodities above the refrigeration unit to prevent a lack of aircirculation . oProducts can maintain their temperatur e inside an inoperable freezer for up to 24 hours provided warm air does enter through an open freezer door. oThe freezer must be maintained at 0\u00b0 F before loading . 2.SP ECIFIC COMMODITY INFORMATION. The following offers specific commodity information: Cream style soups break down during freezing, but are not spoiled; they are usable. Freezing alters the appearance of the starch thickening in pie fillings; baking restores the desirable appearance . Canned eggnog and non- dairy creamer must be stored below 70\u00b0F . Chill storage is recommended for long holding periods . These products must not be frozen. Sensitive chill subsistence such as dairy products, eggs , and processed meats should be stored in between 32\u00b0F to 41\u00b0F . Vegetables such as lettuce, celery, carrots, cauliflower, radishes , parsley, and mushrooms that requir e sensitive chill temperatures of 32\u00b0F to 41\u00b0F must be stored in a separate area.NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management F-6 Relative humidity for the storage of most chilled items should be in the range of 85 percent to 90 percent . Chill injury decreases the shelf life o f many sensitive items such as lettuce, grapes, and bananas. Constant monitoring is essential to avoid any unnecessary damage. Figure F -1 below provides information for dry storage, refrigeration storage , and freezer storage . Figure F -1 Storage Information DRY STORAGE (food, equipment, supplies) 1. Rotate stock in FIFO order ; create a system such as using dating . 2. Store stock at least six (6) inches off the floor . 3. Loose food and unwrapped food, or food where the original package has been broken, shall be stored in pest- proof containers or in tied plastic bags; it must be labeled properly . 4.

This Section provides basic guidelines and describes basic food inspection procedures to determine the serviceability of subsistence items . This Section covers canned products , products subject to infestation , and refrigeration breakdowns. T he following inspections shall be carried out: Check ing for rust, dents, crimped edges, and other obvious damage Check ing for leaking packages/cans Check ing for swelling cans M inor rust or dents do not necessarily affect the product . Surface rust, that is easily removed by wiping with a clean cloth, is not cause for concern; however , a can is considered unsafe if it is leaking or if its ends are distorted. P roducts that appear to have an abnormal odor or appearance should not be consumed . They shall be placed on hold in a secure area to prevent the possibility of use and for further evaluation by veterinary or medical inspectors. I n the event that mission requirements do not allow retaining quantities of questionable product in a hold status, a representative sample (6 normal and 6 abnormal) must be saved for subsequent testing before discarding the entire lot . These samples must be saved, clearly marked , and segregated to preclude inadvertent consum ption . When possible, samples should be submitted to a U.S. Army veterinary unit or Naval PMA . Pictures of the suspect item shall be taken in the event samples cannot be submitted for testing purposes. Defects are discussed below. a.Can Defects . If any of the following defects are present in canned products, the product should NOT be consumed: Severely dented or buckled cans . Swollen cans . Note that c anned coffee, molasses, baking soda , and baking mixes will exhibit swelling after time because of normal gas production ; they are not necessarily unsafe. However, these items shall be inspected to ensure they are safe to consume once the product has been opened. Cans that are dented moderately to severely in the area of the side seam or end seam . Cans that are leaking or that have pinholes . Pinholes are tiny holes caused by action of food acids during prolong ed storage. Pull-top containers with obvious dents . Cans with pitted rust that cannot be removed by wiping with a clean cloth . Cans that are crushed to the point where they cannot be opened manually . They w ill hav e crimped edges on top. b.Aesthetic Defects . The following defects do NOT indicate a loss of container serviceability; the product may be issued and consumed without concern.Surface rust that can be removed by wiping with a clean cloth. Body dents on the side of the can that does not affect a seam. Slight to moderate dents on or near a double seam. Slight to moderate paneling (ridges) on the sides of the can. 2.P RODUCTS SUBJECT TO INFESTATION. The following action shall be taken when insects are found in the product at sea. S ubsistence that is heavily infested (that is, with sev en or more living or dead insects per pound) must be destroyed. Lightly infested subsistence may be used after it is frozen, sifted, and re -inspected provided the infestation does not involveNAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management F-8certain species (Trogoderma) of insects . Heavily infested products must not be consumed or issued to another ship . Specimens must be saved for species identification when the shi p returns to shore . It is essential to have insect species identified by an entomologist in the Preventive Medicine Office. The following steps shall be taken for infestations: Isolate the product and place it in the freezer if possible. Freezing will kill or deter th e dev elopment and prevent the spreading of insects . Examine the products in and near the infested area . Sift flour after freezing to remove insects . After freezing and sifting, the product may be safe for consumption depending on the spe cies. Request assistance from destination shore Veterinary Services or Preventive Medicine . I n most cases destruction at sea is the most cost -effective method of disposition. Tak e pi ctures of a suspect commodity to show to medical authorities. Report los ses. Notify the activity from which that product was obtained; provide the date and quantity received. Notify other ships that may have been issued a similar product . Communicate with each other. Products that are affected by rodents are unfit for consum ption. NOTE: Freezing for 72 hours will arrest development of an infestation but will NOT kill all of the insects . To kill insects in all stages of development, the infested product must be kept at 0\u00b0F for two weeks . Freezing normally will not damage dry semi -perishable items such as grains, starch, cereals, and dehydrated foods ; but it may alter their physical appearance. 3.R EFRIGERATION AND/ OR FREEZER BREAKDOWNS. Perform an inspection of the product to establish its serviceability . Inspection should be conducted as soon as possibl e be fore the product is re-frozen. The inspection area must be well lighted and clean . It is imperative that the item is inspected in the freezer to prevent additional loss. The inspection and decision making processes are discussed below. a.Inspection Process. The following steps shall be followed for the inspection process: Take the internal temperatures of the products nearest to the door first. Next check products on top of pallets and work downward. Check the inside of the cases . It may be necessary to look at additional cases to determine serviceability . Frozen products generally are packed evenly within a case . A pr oduct that is located to one side of the case may have been thawed and re- frozen. Disposition of partially defrosted products must be determined according to the riskfactor categories. b.Decision Making for Disposition of Food Items Exposed to Refrigeration Failures . Th e f ollowing steps shall be followed for disposing of refrigeration f ailures (see Figure F -2 bel ow): Step 1 . Determine the length of time the food has been maintained at an ambient temperature greater than 41\u00b0F. Step 2. Classify the temperature -stressed food item as SAFE or RISK based on Table F-1 below . Step 3. Determine the product 's temperature . Step 4. Determine if the food item has exceeded its Time Temperature Limit basedon Table F-2 below . Step 5. Make the disposition decision.NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management F-9Food Item Safe (Table 1)? SAFE aRTE/Precooked? Originally Frozen? RISK 2 Salted/Cured? bRISK 3 Canned?

Determining the proper disposition of subsistence requires a logical sequence of actions regardless of the type of subsistence ( perishable or semi -perishable) . This ensure s t hat only safe and serviceable subsistence is issued. 2. PROCEDURE FOR DETERMINING THE PROPER D ISPOSITION OF SUBSISTENCE. The procedure for determining the proper disposition of subsistence is discussed below.NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management F-13Step 1. Identify the problem by determin ing any events , including the following , that may affect the safety, condition, and/or serviceability of subsistence (note that q uestionable products must be segregated):: Refrigeration malfunction Power outage Physical damage Insect and/or r odent infestation Improper holding t emperature Insufficient shelf life and/or expired products Chemical, Biological, or Radiological (CBR) event Step 2 . Determine the events that may have affected the subsistence items in question. Obtain, at a minimum, the information o n the list below . More information makes it easier to make the appropriate disposition. Date of Pack (DOP) ; expiration date. National/Local Stock Number (NSN/LSN) . Prime Vendor Contract Number . Name and address of the product m anufacturer . Date of r eceipt . Lot numbers . Detailed history of condition, storage, processing, age of commodity, and any pertinent information associated with the problem . Step 3. Notify applicable supporting Veterinary Services and/or Preventive Medical Authority by contacting them and requesting assistance . While in port, assistance may be requested from the supporting U.S . Army veterinary service (AVI) unit . The AVI will assist in making the appropriate decision for future use or condemnation when a problem has been identified as a potential food risk or wholesomeness issue . Army veterinary personnel have the technical expertise to determine the safety and wholesomeness of subsistence items. When it is not possible to obtain Army v eterinary assistance, the ranking SUPPO or Senior Officer, with the assistance of the Medical Officer, should determine the disposition of stock. S tep 4 . Examine the p roduct using t he procedures g iven below t o determine questionable commodities. Rem ove the product to a well -lighted area . Remove the product from the master container . Remove individual packages (if applicable) . Check the product for any signs of sliminess . Check the product for dehydration and/or freezer burn (a white fibrous texture and/or ice crystals on the product) . Look for any off color not associated with a normal -appearing product Check changes in the master container 's shape for indications of temperature abuse. Check freezer and chill storage temperature logs for an increase or decrease in temperature. Make sure that the freezer or chill unit thermometers are accurate and calibrated , Thor ough inspection enables identif ication and isolation of problems and allow s for proper corrective actions . Lack of proper lighting and poor air quality impairs the senses and lessens the ability to assess the product properly . Deterioration of products is proportional to their time in storage and to the variation in holding temperatures . Temperature abuse means allowing NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management F-14potentially hazardous foods to remain in the temperature danger zone ( 42\u00b0F to 134\u00b0F ) for more than four hours . Potentially hazardous foods abused in this manner are considered unsafe for consumption. The Veterinary Service and/ or Medical Department Representative shall be notified immediately . Such abused foods should NOT be consumed, even after cooking. Thoroughly inspect questionable items and complete steps 5 and 6 following your inspection. Ste p 5. Make appropriate disposition by segregat ing subsistence items that show signs of temperature abuse, contamination, insects, leaking, opened packages, or that otherwise are considered unsafe or unfit for their intended use. These segregated items shall be inspected by the responsible AVI or Medical Department Representative. Final disposition determination is the responsibility of veterinary service personnel or MDR . If items are received from a Combat Logistic Force (CLF) vessel, the Food Service Officer will notify the SUPPO immediately . The SUPPO will contact the issuing CLF for a report of the findings. Ste p 6. Undertake documentation. All actions and losses shall be reported . If a suspected foodborne illness incident occur s involving subsistence, it is imperative that item(s) be immediately placed on a medical hold status and provided with a \"DO NOT USE\" placard. This will prevent any cross contamination . Foodborne illness generally is preventable; therefore , it is important to document actions taken to protect the health and welfare of all personnel . All related subsistence requiring a hazardous recall shall be reported to the Defense Logistic s Agency ( DLA) via priority message . (Refer to NAVSUPINST 10110.8C DOD Hazardous Food and Nonprescription Drug Recall System (ALFOODACT) and to Section 1005 of this G uide). 3.INF ORMATION FOR REPORTING FOODBORNE ILLNESS . The following information is necessary when reporting a foodborne illness: The product in question Number of personnel affected Processing time and temperature Age of the product Storage time and temperature Manufacturer, lot number, date of pack Quantity on hand Stock Number (NSN/LSN) Pictures of the suspect item Document ation of any off odor or conditi on (what did it look or smell like ?) Medical Officer observations of personnel affected and diagnosis of foodborne Illness The date the product was delivered or received Contract number The supplying distributor or vendor In addition to procedures for reporting suspect hazardous subsistence items, the following discrepancy must be reported in accordance with NAVSUP Publication 486, chapter 5, paragraph 5300 that covers proper procedures for completion of the Report of Discrepancy (ROD) . Pictures shall be attached to Standard Form 364, Report of Discrepancy (ROD) . A copy of the ROD shall be forwarded to navsup_foodservice@navy.mil to help prevent similar future issues . 1005 H AZARDOUS FOOD RECAL L PROGRAM Whenever a suspected hazardous food item is identified, the local authorized Veterinary Services shall be contacted (while in port ) or the medical officer shall be contacted when at sea . NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management F-15Instructions are specified in NAVSUPINST 10110.8C and NAVSUP Pub 486. The following inform ation must be reported: Brand name Name and address of the manufacturer/processor USDA/USDC inspection plant code (if applicable) Contract number Resource where the product was received (Prime Vendor, CLF, or local supplier) Date received Quantity received Description of container(s) Lot number from the master container, individual packages, can codes, or other packaging Quantity of the product that is on a medical hold status Symptoms of illness or death attributed to or suspected to be caused by the item;number of affected personnel; point of contact Laboratory where samples were sent, if applicable.

The pre- expending process mandates that distance-s upported units are authorized only to transfer out to another distance-s upported unit. 1009 LCS SURVEYS All Surveys (Loss Without Survey and Loss With Survey) shall be reported to the LST Ashore FSO within 24 hours. Unit and Ashore FSOs shall follow survey instructions in accordance with NAVSUP P-486 VOL 1, Chapter 6, Paragraph 6000 through Paragraph 6002. The Surveys shall be conducted and recorded as follows: Loss Without Surveys conducted/recorded in the Expenditure Log NAVSUP Form 1334. Loss Wit h Surveys shall be conducted and recorded on the Financial Liability Investigation of property Loss DD Form 200 to provide the required documentation. 1010 LCS OVER AND UNDER ISSUES The Over/Under Issue rules outlined in Para 7002.13 of the NAVSUP P- 486 apply . The LST Officer , \"Accountable\" Officer, Ship's Supply Office r, and the Leading Culinary Specialist are responsible for the physical inventory of the food. T he SUPPO and the Leading Culinary Specialist on board are resp onsible to the U .S. Government for maintaining inventory control and preventing pilferage. 1011 LCS RE TURNS All General Messes (GMs) use accounting procedures whereby activities account for receipts and expenditures of food items under a subsistence appropriation. Under this authority, the GM shall submit financial returns monthly using the General Mess Summary Document (NAVSUP J-8 NAVSUP P-486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Servi ce Management Form 1359) . The Food Service Management (FSM) system monthly closeouts shall be completed and submitted to NAVSUP N43 2 no later than the 15th day of the month following the end of the reporting period. For additional information for General Mess financial returns refer to NAVSUP P-486, VOL I, Chapter 7, Part C and D. 1012 L CS RETAINED RETUR NS The following files must be maintained on a daily basis and must be added to the Accountability files at the end of the reporting period for retained returns: Locally-G enerat ed Audit Sheet NAVSUP Form Form 200 NAVSUP Form 1334 DD Form 1131 Standard Form 215 (FRBB Deposit Ticket) (LCS) NAVCOMPT Form 470 (Cash Payment Book) (DDG1K) Receipt Documents including the following: oVendor and Stores Receipt Reports oMILSTRIP and P-486, Vo l I.NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management K-1APPENDIX K OPERATIONAL RATIONS Pa rt A: OPERATIONAL RATIONS Introduction ................................................................................................................... 1000 Feeding Plans a Field Mess Operations .................................................................................................. 1003 NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management K-2APPENDIX K OPERATIONAL RATIONS PART A: OPERATIONAL RATIONS 1000 I NTRODUCTION Navy feeding aboard ship and at ashore General Messes (GMs) generally is accomplished with menus developed by TYCOM in conjunction with GM personnel . These menus, also known as \"A Ration\" menus, use a variety of perishable (chill and freeze storage) and semi -perishable (dry storage) food items . Other types of menus and/or individually packaged rations may be required to accommodate battle and/or emergency feeding, planned and/or field mess operations , and independent and detached operations. 1001 F EEDING PLANS AND MODIFIED \"A RATION\" AND \"B RATION\" MENUS 1.BATTLE/EMERGENCY FEEDING PLANS. Navy activities generally are r equired to have battle/emergency feeding plans . Ashore activ ities may have an emergency feeding plan for military personnel and an additional emergency feeding plan for government workers on base and for the local population in the event of disasters such as hurricanes . These plans must adhere to the guidance of the activity's next level in the Chain of Command. It is recommended that Navy activities develop their battle and/or emergency feeding plans using Modified \"A Ration\" and \"B Ration\" menus that use the same peris hable and semi- perishable food items used for normal feeding . Generally, emergency feeding shall be done with meals, such as snack meals or box lunches, that may be prepared with minimum labor. Indi vidually packaged operational rations shall be excluded from battle and/or emergency feeding plans and are not to be used for emergency feeding except in accordance with Paragraph 1002 (below) of this Appendix . Ex cept for emergency base- wide and/or community feeding plans, food items are funded by the subsistence appropriation, subhead 1453, and carried as part of the GM inventory. Stoc k rotation and consumption plans must be in place to ensure that food is used before its expiration. 2.EM ERGENCY BASE- WIDE AND COMMUNITY FEEDING PLANS . Aspects of these plans are discussed below. a.Fund Citation. Food items for inventories that support ashore emergency base- wide or community feeding plans shall be requisitioned only upon approval, and with ultimate charge to funds allocated by, the responsible primary support bureau, C ommand , or office (that is, the activity's operating target budget (OPTAR)). b.Inventory Level . Setting the inventory level or an ashore activity's emergency base -wide or community feeding plan is the responsibility of the activity's pri mary support bureau, Command , or office . This inventory shall not be part of the GM's inventory . Because of their potential transfer to the GM , the types and quantities of food items in this inventory must be coordinated with the GM Food Service Officer (FSO) .NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management K-3c.Stock Rotation. Rotation of food items that are stocked to support ashore emergency base- wide or community feeding plans ar e the responsibility of the activity and its primary support bureau, C ommand, or office . If food items that have been stocked for such plans cannot be returned to the source of supply for credit, they may be transferred to an ashore GM for consumption before their expiration date. Such transfers shall be done via SF 1080, Voucher for Transfer between Appropria tions and/or Funds or via NAVCOMPT Form 2277, Voucher for Disbursement and/or collections . The ashore GM shall accept the inventory only if it can be used in an upcoming event. d.Accounting Classification. The accounting classification that is charged shal l be the subsistence appropriation, subhead 1453 . This charge shall be a \"receipt with charge\" for the receiving GM. The accounting classification to be credited shall be provided by the transferring activity ; for example, the OPTAR . p repared from a limited number of perishable and semi -perishable easy -to-use food items from normal menus . These items support operations, such as battle or emergency conditions, when galley cooking facilities are temporarily shut down or are limited by insufficient manning resources . Examples of easy -to-prepare food items are canned ham, tuna, cold cuts, canned fruits, precooked fried chicken, fresh fruit, salad vegetables, cheese, peanut butter, jam, crackers, juices , and beverages. 4.\"B RATION\" MENUS . \"B Ration\" menus consist of approximately 100 semi -perishable food items ; they generally are used for field operations . Examples of \"B Ration \" food items are canned and dehydrated meats and vegetables, canned fruits, and bakery mixes . \"B Ration \" items require cooking facilities such as field ranges. 1002 IN DIVIDUALLY PACKAGED OPERATIONAL RATIONS 1.GENERAL . Individuall y packaged operational rations are used to satisfy feeding requirements for operations that involv e unusual circumstances or when it is impractical or impossible to follow regular feeding routines or practices . Such circumstances may exist during amphibious or remote long duration operations such as naval mobile construction operations. Af loat and ashore personnel who are part of independent and detached operations that are away from GMs for a period that exceeds the safety limits of potentially hazardous foods may be fed individual operational rations such as meals -ready -to-eat (MREs ). GMs of afloat and ashore units are authorized, without obtaining other approvals but adhering to the guidance of their Type Commander (TYCOM) , to acquire and maintain contingency inventories of MREs for such situations. Indiv idually packaged operational rations should not be used for emergency feeding unless modified \"A Ration\" menus are impracticable for the circumstances ( such as when food safety limits would be exceeded). As hore activities that have emergency base- wide or community feeding plans may include contingency inventories of packaged operational rations only if authorized by the next level in the chain of command. The Tri-Service Food Code, NAVMED P- 5010-1 provides cri teria and guidelines for prepar ing and serving food using proper holding temperatures and provides guidelines for the time period that potentially hazardous foods may be considered safe for consumption. NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management K-42.MEAL, READY- TO-EAT , INDIVIDUAL . This ration consists of dehydrated and processed ready -to-eat foods . Three MREs are needed for one complete ration each day. Twelve different menus are packaged in each shipping case . These rations are expensive, cannot be rotated by normal demand and issue procedures , and require more semi -perishable storage space than A Ration and B R ation menu items . Authorization to purchase MREs must be granted by appropriate T YCOM /Major Claimant. 3.RATIO N COLD WEATHER (RCW), INDIVIDUAL . This provides an operational rat ion for two separate operational scenarios . The Meal, Cold Weather (MCW) is intended for cold weather feeding; it will not freeze , and it supplies extra drink mixes for countering dehydration during cold weather activities . It can be issued at three per day for a complete cold weather ration. The MCW is packaged in a white camouflage pouch similar to the RCW . The Food Packet, Long Range Patrol (LRP) is a restricted calorie ration meant for special operations where resupply is not available and weight and volume are critical factors . It is issued at one per soldier per day for up to ten days . The LRP is packaged in a tan camouflage menu pouch similar to the current MRE. The com bined product assembly consists of twelve ration/meals packets per shipping container . The weight of each case is approximately 15 pounds and it measures approximately 1.02 cubic feet. The twelve menus contain dehydrated entree items and other accessory items . Each menu provides approximately 1, 540 kilocalories (15 percent protein, 35 percent fat, and 50 percent carbohydrate) . One menu bag is used for the LRP, which is a restricted calorie ration that is designed to be used as one menu bag for one individual per day . The MCW requires three menu bags per person per day and provides 4, 500 kilocalories that are necessary to replenish loss of energy from exertion in extreme cold. 4.FUND CITA TION. MREs and M CWs used for independent and detached operations sha ll be requisitioned by afloat GMs through Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) us ing a DD Form 1149 , preferred method . Fund Code PZ (afloat) shall be used when DD Form 1348-1- A (DoD Single Line Item Requisition System Document) has to be used. 5.INVENT ORY LEVELS. In addition to regular food items, afloat GMs may stock MREs for independent and detached operations on a limited scale. Situations that requir e MREs generally occur very infrequent ly and generally involve a small number of personnel ; therefore, the number of MREs stocked for such situations must be minimized . The following information provides a guide for stock levels : 40 percent to 50 percent of crew size up to 150 : not to exceed 60 MREs/5 boxes 30 percent to 40 percent of crew size 151 to 400 : not to exceed 120 MREs/10 boxes 18 percent to 30 percent of crew size 401 to 1000: not to exceed 240 MREs/20 boxes 14 percent to 18 percent of crew size over 1,000: not to exceed 720 MREs/60 boxes The MR E inventory levels above are based on crew size and may be increased. 6.STOCK ROTATION (AFLOAT). Af loat GMs are responsible for rotating MRE contingency stocks before their expiration. If the MREs cannot be consumed onboard in time, they shall be tran sferred to an activity that shall consume them during planned operations. 7.FUND CITATION. MREs and MC Ws used for independent and detached operations shall be requisitioned by ashore GMs from Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) using DD Form 1149. Fund code PZ shall be used if DD Form 1348-1-A (DoD Single Line Item Requisition System Document) is used.NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management K-58.INVENTORY LEVEL . In addi t ion to regular food items, ashore GMs may stock MREs for independent and detached operations in accordance with Region/TYCOM guidance. Inventories of MREs shall be maintained at the level specified by the NMCB Table of Allowance (TA -01) 9.STOCK RO TATION (ASHORE) . Ashore GMs are responsible for rotating MRE contingency stocks before their expiration. If the MREs cannot be consumed in time, they shall be transferred to an activity that shall consume them during planned operations. If transf er is not feasible, the MREs shall be consumed in the GM in place of regular rations . (This may be done during battle drill exercises , or the MREs may be offered as an alternative for a regular meal). 10. NAVAL MOBILE CONSTRUCTION BATTALIONS (NMCB). NMCBs that operate field mess operations and/or independent and detac hed operations are authorized to feed individually packaged operational rations, such as MREs and/or RCWs , when one of the following conditions is met: There is no resupply or local vendor logistical s upport av ailable The dis tance from the GM to the field mes s operation is such that regular food safety limits are exceeded 11. RECEIPTS. Receipts of operational rations s hall be recorded in the Subsistenc e Ledger (NAVSUP Form 335) and the Record of Receipts and Ex penditures (NAVSUP Form 367) in the same manner as other food items . If the GM agrees to accept MREs from the base contingency inventory to assist in stock rotation, the transfer price shall be at the last receipt price. 12. EXPENDITURES. Operational rations shall be expended as stores consumed, transfer without charge, sale of bulk food items, or transfer with charge. Issues to the GM shall be at the last receipt price. 13. ON-SI TE CONSUMPTION. MREs and/or MCW s issued for consumption in the GM shall be expended as stores consumed. Meals may be sold to officers and enlisted personnel in receipt of Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BA S) during these scheduled meals. Payment shall be made at the rates s et for regular GM meals. 14. OFF-SI TE CONSUMPTION. MREs and/or MCW s shall be expended when they are issued for consumption by personnel (Paragraph 100 0 and Paragraph 1002) participating in landing operations or remote long duration independent and detached operations. 15. STORES CONSUMED. When the GM issues MREs and/or MCWs for consumption, the GM will need to claim ration credit for the MREs/MCWs. 16. TRANSFERS. When a transfer without reimbursement is conducted between GMs, the receiving activity (also an established mess) will claim ration credit for MREs and/or MCWs transferred. The requesting activity shall prepare the DD Form 1149 and s hall include the type of personnel to be furnished meals. 17. REQUISITIONING MRES. MREs requis itioned for field mess or independent and detac hed operations, or to augment inventories to conform to TYCOM/Region guidance, are received at the last receipt price. MREs accepted as a transfer without reimbursement from another Navy activity that is rotating its MREs are received at the last receipt price. Such MREs shall be c onsumed in accordance with the procedures for on-si te or off-si te cons umption at the last receipt price. K-6NAVSUP P-4 86, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management 18. MONETARY ALLOWANCES. Meals fed as operational rations shall be c ounted, converted, and reported for ration credit in the same manner as ration credit is allowed for regular rations. MREs are charged at the last rec eipt price. Boxes of 12 MREs shall be converted to four rations when fed. Using this methodology, GMs shall not have their operating cost adversely affected by the premium cost of MREs. 19. CASH, BULK, AND VOUCHER SALES. Cash, bulk, and voucher sales are discussed below. a.Cash Sales. GMs shall use the s ale of meal rates included in NAVSUPNOTE 7330 for cash sales of all operational rations. b.Bulk Sales. Rates charged for bulk sales of food items for modified \"A Ration\" and \"B Ration\" menus and individually pack aged operational rations s uch as MREs, shall be at the las t receipt price. c.Voucher Sales. When a GM sells meals or bulk food that are to be paid by Standard Form 1080, Voucher for Transfers between Appropriations and/or Funds , the GM must create a voucher citing the collection and the disbursement acc ounting classifications in accordance with NAVSUPNOTE 7330. SF Form 1080 is not complete for processing until it includes the accounting classification of the office receiving funds, the signature of the authorized administrativ e/certifying officer of the office charged, and the accounting classification of the office c harged. DD Form 1149 is not sufficient for this purpose; it s hall be used only as proof of transfer. 20. SURVEYS OF MREs . Surveys of MREs shall be completed in the same manner as other food items in acc ordance with Pa ragraph 6000 through Paragraph 6002. MREs should not be surveyed except in unusual circumstanc es. Before their expiration, they should be consumed or transferred for consumption during field mess or independent and detached operations or consumed in the GM in plac e of regular rations. Six months before their expiration a determination must be made whether or not the outdated MREs are fit for human consumption. MREs should be disposed of only if they are determined to be unfit for human consumption ; age alone does not mean the MREs must be disposed of . Outdated MREs that are suspected to be unfit must be inspected by an authorized M edical Representative who must provide a written statement substantiating a determination of unfitness for human consumption that must accompany any disposal loss claims. 1003 FIELD MESS OPERATIONS 1.GENERAL . Afloat and ashore personnel who are part of field mess operations away from GMs for periods exceeding safety limits of potentially hazardous foods may be fed individually packaged operational rations such as MRE s and/or M CWs . Afloa t and ashore GMs that support such personnel are authorized to acquire and maintain appropriate inventories of MREs and/or RCWs following the guidance of the GM's next level in the chain of command. Establishment of a field mess requires the approval of the GM's next level in the chain of command including the Regional Commander/Regional FSO (FSO) . Notification or establishment of a field mess shall be provided to BUPERS who shall provide financial authorization and guidance. 2.ORDERI NG PROCEDURES . Orders shall be created in the FSM system using DD Form 1149. Currently, a Requisition Routing Sheet (see Figure K -1 below) must be used with all DD Forms 1149 generated for the preferred Prime Vendor (PV) method .K -7NAVSUP P-486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management To prevent unauthorized commitments, all orders outs ide the PV must be obligated by BUPERS before the Command can proc ess the order with DLA. Urgent requests are proces sed in a timelymanner with TYCOM's s upport when the forms are filled out correctly. The form is a PDF with fillable and drop down sections; signatures must be signed digitally. 3.INVENTORY LEVEL . Inventories of MREs and M CWs shall be maintained only if the frequency of planned operations ensures their consumption before their expiration. If timely consumption is not possible, only the required number of MREs and/or M CWs should be requisitioned for a particular planned operation. 4.STOCK ROTATION. If inventories of MREs and M CWs are maintained, rotation shall be by consumption during planned operations before their expiration.NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management K-8 Figure K -1 Requisition Routing Sheet NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management L-1APPENDIX L TRAINING AND PROFESSIO NAL CERTIFICAT IONS P art A: TRAINING General ................................................................................................................................

An active training program facilitates better personnel performance and an improved operation in terms of production and quality of service to customers . An effective training program affords galley personnel a better opportunity for advancement, reinforces food service fundamentals, and alig ns galley personnel with their industry counterparts . Trai ning and maintenance programs must be carefully planned, executed, controlled, and documented . Because lack of time is a constant in every C ommand and there rarely is time to attend shore- based schools , attention must be paid to the training available in individual C ommands , and time must be carefully allocated to satisfy food service training and maintenance requirements . The information in this C hapter aids in formulat ing and maintaining an effective food service training program . Training support is available by contacting NAVSUP Food Service Division . See NAVSUP P- 476 for an updated list of NAVSUP N4 32 personnel. 1001 D IVISION TRAINING PROGRAM 1.FOOD SERVICE TRAINING . This Section provides information on organizing a local food service training program . Each local Command determines the c ontents of a training program based on its own needs . A c omprehensive training program must include a variety of delivery methods including the following: lectures demonstrations hands -on application in conjunction with on- the-job training capitalizing on teachable moments videos as supplemental reinforcement schools and correspondence courses when applicable When organiz ing a training program, it is important to remember that training is a means to an end; the program's objectives must form the foundation of the program. Specific goals and objectives must take into account the needs of the food service operation and/or t he Command's Culinary Specialists (CSs) . The following tools may be useful when establishing a program to meet the goals and objectives of the D ivision : Ins tructor aids Training methods Training aids CurriculumNAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management L-3Less on pl anning Records and schedules 2.RECORDI NG TRAINING . Training must be recorded using a procedure that is simple but thorough. Individual training packages and folders shall be structured and maintained according to the guidelines of the individual ships, Type Commander (TYCOM) , and Chief of Navy Education and Training (CNET) . The following information is the minimum that should be kept on file by the Divisional Training Petty Officer: Record of food handler's physical exam . Food handler's training log. Job rotation log . Record of training accomplished. Copies of profile sheets of exams completed. Personal Qualifications Standards (PQS) for General Mess (GM) operations . All other information considered pertinent by the Food Service Officer (FSO) . 1002 INS TRUCTOR AIDS 1.GENERAL. The suggestions given below will help upgrade and improv e the level of instruction in a formal training program. The Fo o d Service Di vision's Pe tty Of ficers, who may have had little formal training in instructing, are responsible for instruction. Va rious aids are available for all CSs to become proficient in instructor training. 2.INSTRUCTOR TRAINING SCHOOLS. These schools develop the skills and confidence required of good instructors. Recommend one or more Pe tty Officers be sent to an Instructor Tr aining School. 3.NAVY INSTRUCTIONAL THEORY (NAVEDTRA 134A). Th e Navy Instructio nal Theory manual may be used as a textbook for the inexperienced instructor. Each FSO should read the manual and make it av ailable to the Pe tty Officers. 4.TRAINING SESSIONS. The first step in establishing a training program is to schedule sessions for instructors. Each instructor must learn the principles of learning discussed below. a.Self-M otivation . When self-m otivation for training is not present, the instructor must pr ovide the motivation that is essential to learning through methods s uch as self-s atisfaction, p romotion, and recognition. b.Various Training Methods. Th e learning process is enhanced considerably by using various training methods such as displays, mockups, movies, slides, and other audi ovisual aids . . c.Facts. The instructor must be sure of the facts. It is more difficult to unlearn and relearn than to learn correctly the first time. d.Time t o Learn. The instructor must provide time for the trainees to practice what they have learned. e.Relationship. Th e relationship the instructor establishes with trainees is an important ingredient towards learning and retention. f.Different Learning Styles. The instructor must recognize that people have different l earning styles and must adapt to ensure that all members of the class/session are gaining the knowledge and skill to meet the training objective g.Quizzes as M etrics. Th e i mpact of the lesson presentations should be measured with s ummary quizzes or performance demonstrations .NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management L-4h.Ex amples and Demonstrations . Instructors sh all provide trainees with an example or demonstration related to the training session to demonstrate competency. The pr oblem of the lack of qualified instructors may be partly solved by us ing instructors from other divisions for damage control, first aid, and firearms training . The FSO should arrange with other D ivision Officers for the services of their personnel to perform specialized training. 1003 T RAINING METHODS 1.GENERAL . Most of the sessions listed in the Section on \"Curriculum\" can be taught by lecture; however, this method must be combined with a demonstration with hands -on applications. It is important that the applicable equipment, small wares, records, reference materials , and other supporting information are available. On -the-job training frequently is the most effective method of training because many professional topics correspond to actual job requirements . The following subparagraphs provide s pecific information on the training methods of lecture, demonstration, and on- the-job training . 2.LE CTURE . The lecture is the transfer of information from the instructor and resource to the trainee; it can be a quick transfer of information to review previous lecture s or to deliver new information. Lectures must be well organized, follow a logical progression, and be delivered by some one knowledgeable on the subject matter . Solely r eading from a prepared statement or PowerPoint presentation is not an effectiv e method for providing information . The lecture method is particularly useful in giving trainees background information in subject areas before on-the-job training . Lectures may be delivered during quarters or on turnover days . For example, a course on bread making covers topics such as baking theory , the effects of time , and the conditions to which the bread dough is subjected. These topics may be covered by a lecture; however, a demonstration or on -the-job training should follow soon after to enhance the trainee's retention of the material . 3.DEM ONSTRATION. Demonstration emphasizes a specific subject . Demonstration promotes interest through observation and stimulates faster attainment of skills . Demonstration requires prior planning and organization; everything that is part of the demonstration must be ready . It is critical that the instructor is proficient in the subject matter to ensure credibility and the transfer of correct knowledge. T he demonstrator should rehearse before a knowledgeable person who can determine whether the presentation achieves its goals . This method is suitable for teaching trainees equipment operation; how to prepare reports, requisitions, or similar forms ; and how to perform other duties that have a set procedure or standard . When a lecture precedes the demonstration , sufficient information must be presented during the lecture to familiarize trainees with the subject and to prepare them for the demonstration. The instructor must be concise with each step of the demonstration and must show how each step is relevant to the overall operation. The instructor shall ask questions periodically to judge whether trainees understand the demonstrated steps . Everyone must understand all the materia l and steps covered. A practice se ssion should be conducted after the demonstration for trainees to put into practice what they have learned.NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management L-54.ON-T HE-J OB TRAINING. On-t he-job training (OJT) is done spontaneously while a trainee is engaged in normal work activity. OJT is an informal opportunity to engage with the trainee and staff. A good instructor or mentor recognizes a teachable moment and turn s it into a positive opportunity rather than one that turns into an embarrassing situation. Good leadership and instructors are c onsistently engaged in the activity of their charges without micromanaging. OJ T capitalizes on the strengths of all trainees and mentors to correct areas of weakness in job performance. This type of training is useful when new products and methods are introduced or when established procedures change. OJT builds on existing skills and knowledge to ensure that foundation skills grow to be come advanced skill sets. This method is a delivery method for teaching complex oper ations. 5.ADDITIONAL METHODS. The two methods of training discussed below may be useful i n certain circumstances. a.Role Playing. In this method the instructor describes a situation, has trainees act out t he situation, and has the class analyze the situation. This method is particularly useful in developing the poise and tact required of wardroom food service personnel and Food Se rvic e Attendants (FSAs). b. Training Symposiums. Training Symposiums are valuable for changing attitudes, extending practical knowledge through the experiences of others, and correcting misunderstandings. This method is effective with experienced CSs for resolving problems, s timulating ideas, and for establishing or changing policy. 1004 TRAININ G AIDS 1.GENERAL . Properly constructed and used training aids are valuable assets for any training lesson. Training aids illustrat e or demonstrat e subject matter and stimulate and hold the interest of the trainees . However, training aids only reinforce the instructor; they do not replace the instructor . The instructor must be competent and able to deliver and demonstrate the information. Training aids that are used primarily in training situations are discussed below . 2.PRINTED MATERIAL . Printed material such as books, pictures, and drawings are valuable because they provide easy reference material; these aids should not be used as a substitute for teaching . Reading or passing out material to trainees and then asking a few questions about the material is a waste of valuable time that could be put to better use. Printed material should be passed out or assigned for reading before the class session so that trainees can study the material to gain basic information about the subject matter . This lay s the foundation for class instruct ion and helps the trainees follow the presentation. 3.TRAINING VIDEO S AND /OR DVDs . Training videos and/or DVDs are extremely useful as training aids to present information and to demonstrate skills or techniques . The instructor must preview the video and/or DVD (regardless of the number of times previously viewed) and make notes on the main points and on those portions of the video and/or DVD that are of particular importance. The video and/or DVD must be introduced to the class giving the title and reasons for showing it and alerting thetrainees to the portions of particular importance. The video and/or DVD shall beNAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management L-6discu ssed and summarize d; any misunderstandings the trainees may have about the subjects covered must be cleared up . 4.TRA INING COST . The Expenditure Log, NAVSUP Form 1334 (Loss Without Survey) , may be used to expend up to $ 200.00 maximum per month for food materials used for training. All food items used for training must be entered on NAVSUP Form 1334 as separate single line item entries not to exceed $2 00.00 per month. 5.SPECIAL IZED PERSONNEL . A person who has expertise in a particular field or area that is covered in a class session is a very valuable training asset . These specialized personnel offer experience and knowledge in their field that can develop an enthusiasm for the subject in the trainees . For example, an expert on manpower usage can demonstrate proper techniques of work flow that can be practiced on the job , an expert storekeeper can explain inventory procedures , and an expert pastry chef might demonstrate the fine points of preparing pies that would be impossible to learn from a recipe card. The TYCOM and Legal Representative must be contacted before any contract is entered into that will use specialized personnel for training . 6.CHALK BOARDS AND CHARTS . If a chalkboard is to be effective, then a s much of the class material as possible must be written on the chalkboard before the class begins . New material must be written quickly, and the trainees' line of vision must not be obscured; the instructor's back shall not face the class . Charts are valuable as permanent aids because they can be prepared in advance and are easily moved around. Effective charts are s imple, the material is understandable at first glance, and the lettering and illustrations are large enough to be easily read or recognized. Charts are quite effective for presenting material such as enlargements of forms or diagrams of equipment or for illustrating the sequence of steps in a procedure. 7.PROF ESSIONAL FOOD SERVICE CERTIFICATIONS. Recognized professional certification may improve individual food service management and culinary competency when applied appropriately. CS guidance for qualifying credentials is located on the Navy COOL website: https://www.cool.navy.mil/ . Additional information is available from NAVSUP N432. 1005 CURRICULUM 1.CULINARY SPECIALIST CURRICULUM. The present CS training curriculum was designed for optimal use and is available on the MyNAVSUP website. The lesson plans allow the trainer to follow a specific sequence so the CSs learn the proper order of food service management. Each lesson should be 20 minutes to 30 minutes long with one topic scheduled per week. All less on plans are updated annually by the Navy Food Management Team (NFMT)'s subject matter experts (SMEs) and posted on the MyNAVSUP website. NFMTs will manage the updates for the CS curriculum lesson plans t o ensure that they are updated with current and accurate information in accordance with NAVSUP policy. Lesson plans for FSA training will be updated by NFM Ts and posted on the MyNAVSUP website for optimal Command use. 2.LONG-R ANGE TRAINING PLAN.

The records in this Appendix are designed to satisfy most TYCOM requirements ; however, individual TYCOM instructions must be checked and balanced with current instructions. 1006 CROSS T RAINING/JOB R OTATION L OG CSs are required to perform in many areas . They may be assigned to billets in ashore or afloat GMs , to include officers' and CPO messes afloat. Cross-t raining and job rotation is required to ensure that personnel receive the proper training in all areas and that they are able to perform in any assignment. Job rotation assignments shall be from six months to nine months . It is the responsibility of officers and leading Petty Officers to ensure that each individual in the organization is afforded the opportunity to function in as many different assignments as possible. Th e CS Job NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management L-10Rot ation Log (Figure L -4 below ) provides a standard format to monitor individual qualifications and job assignments. Nam e: __________________ Rate: _______________ Dat e Reported On Board: ________________________ Job Assignments Date Qualified Date Started Date Rotated LCS Signature Figure L -4 Job Rotation Log 1007 F OOD SERVICE ATTENDA NT TRAINING PROGRAM In many GMs , the missing link in the chain of good food service is effective dining facility management . Frequent turnover of FSAs and the Mess Deck Master -At-Arms (MDMAA) contribut es to this problem . Effective training for these personnel therefore is an essential part of the overall food service training program . NAVSUP P- 486, Volume II, Chapter 2 states that one of the detailed duties assigned to the MDMAA, in conjunction with the medical department, is to administer a training program for FSAs that covers food handling, sani tation requirements , and scullery operations. These operations are discussed below. a.Food Handling . This training must cover s erving food on the serving line and working in food preparation areas (Refer to Food Safety Training Program, BUMEDINST 4061. 4, an d the Training Log for Food Handlers) .NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management L-11b. S ani tation. This training must cover maintaining cleanliness of GM spaces and equipment including washing cooking utensils and baking utensils in the gal ley and bakery . c.Scullery . This training must cover operating the scullery equipment and handling the disposal of food waste. 1008 E VALUATING A TRAINING PROGRAM 1.GENERAL . A successful training may be measured by how well it meets its objectives . Special effort must be made to measure the progress of the trainees and to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Bef ore the training program begins, standards must be formulated to measure trainee progress . Then these standards then are used to measure t rainees' progress. 2.PERF ORMANCE TESTS. A performance test requires a person to perform a particular job under s pecific conditions . Performance tests are especially useful in evaluating OJT. Test instructions must be clear, complete, and standardized so the trainee knows exactly what is expected. Evaluation must be based on standardized procedures for the job being tested. Proper use of goals, materials, equipment, and the observance of safety precautions ar e taken into consideration when making evaluations. 3.WR ITTEN TESTS. Written tests shall be used to measure the trainees' knowledge of facts and their understanding of the subject matter . It is important that test items be carefully prepared so that the results are accurate and reliable. Results sh all be used to measure the instructor's effectiveness . 4.OBSER VING PERFORMANCE. The trainees' on- the-job performance may be evaluated by comparing the efficiency and the quality of their work to that of an experienced worker . For example, the trainee may be asked to prepare a specific recipe and compare it to one prepared by an experienced CS . An improvement in the quality of the product shows that the training has been effectively delivered and retained.NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management L-12PART B: PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATIONS AND THE NAVY COOL PROGRAM 1100 INT RODUCTIO N TO PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATION Appropriately applied, r ecognized professional certification may improve individual food service management and culinary competency .

This Section defines the scope and responsibilities of activities engaged in a Navy Mobile Galley Feeding service . The insertion of a Navy Mobile Galley platform increases Galley feeding mobility , assists with training of Culinary Specialists (CSs), and sustain s Galley Ration -In-Kind (RIK) facilities in a budget -constrained environment. With current food trends and convenient locations , a mobile galley enhances the q uality of service and customer satisfaction that is expected by all personnel in today's military . Activities can d evelop a mobile food truck feeding system that is equipped with small footprint cooking and holding technology for serving a rotating menu of fresh and healthy cuisines that appeal to all personnel . Region , TYCOM , and NAVSUP are committed to providing our forces with nutritious balanced meals . 2.OP ERATIONAL CONCEPT . Static galley feeding no longer meets U .S. Navy manning and lifestyle changes . A mobile galley feeding system allows Navy Food S ervice the flexibility to provide meals pier side, in the shipyard, and in remote locations . The Mobile galley provides a branch mess from the parent galley . The mobil e galley must be coordinated with the Regional Manager and must be outfitted with at the following (at a minimum) : oven f lame grill 4-burner stove flat top grill serving line (4 holes) salad bar (4 trays) handwashing sink reefer freezer warmer storage cabinets 1001 M OBILE FEEDING MESSI NG AND MENU ACTIVATI ON 1.MOBILE FEEDING PROCESS. The first stage of obtaining a mobile vehicle is to i nitiate communication between the food service operation and Regional Managers. This process determines if there are valid requirements to source the vehicle. Menus must be based on feeding requirements and the availability of CS s, support personnel, and food items including Go For Green\u00ae (G4G) menu items. Each Command must have approved standard operat ing procedures in place before conducting mobile feeding . 2.ACT IVATION OF MESSING . Food Service operations shall contact their local Regional Manager to request establishing a branch mess for mobile feeding . Command will submit a menu to the NAVSUP Nutritionist for menu planning, compliance, and approval when initiating Mobile Feeding m essing . Once approved, the menu will be entered into FSM at NAVSUP. Although operational, FSM will be able to capture data for calculat ing the subsistence cost to NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management M-3identify whatever ongoing logistical support is required. T he following must be considered when establishing a Mobile Feeding messing: The use of shelf -stable products for timeliness and ease of preparation in a batch cooking environment. Incorporat ion of 80 percent scratch- cooking methodologies . Consolidat ion of the total number of supporting subsistence line items needed to optimize the range and depth of the monthly cost. Using ingredients that are multi- use to reduce load list items while providing quality recipes within the menu. 3.ACTIVATION OF MENU . Activat ion of an approved Mobile Feeding/Navy Standard Core Menu (NSCM) within the parent facility requires navigat ing to the Activities Module in FSM and choosing the mobile feeding menu. This requires entering an effective date provided by the FSO/Region. Once activated, the Menu will be used until the Food Service Officer (FSO) is notified . 1002 MOBILE F EEDING REPORT OF RATIONS 1.GENERAL. All food must be ordered at the parent galley's FSM system. The mobile feeding unit shall use NAVSUP Forms 1282 to request food and shall have their own NAVSUP Forms 1090. 2.MOBILE FEEDING REPORT OF RATIONS. Rations -in-Kind are entered on NAVSUP Form 1291 and must be verified. NAVSUP Forms 1291 are closed out and turned in to the Cash Collection Agent (CCA) for collection at the end of the day and are manually entered into FSM. The use of a Wireless Credit Card Machine is recommended for cash-p aying customers. If cash sales are collected using DD Fo rm 1544, the Food Truck Cashier must sign them out from the CCA and turn them in at the end of the day to be entered into FSM for accuracy and accountability of headcounts and deposits . Daily headcounts must be posted in FSM under the branch mess. The following guidelines shall be complied with: Daily cleanliness and sanitation requirements must be in complianc e with the TRI Service Food C ode , NAVMED P-5 010-1, and must comply with the following: oAll spaces must be cleaned and sanitized at the end of each meal. oAll food it ems must be stowed at the proper holding temperatures, and proper labels must be in place. oWhen shore power is available, then subsistence may remain in the mobile unit under refrigeration and under lock and key. Local SOPs must provide guidance on propane/diesel/gas usage. Purchase card requests must be approved and tracked for usage and cost in accordance w ith the contract. Daily records keeping shall continue to be posted at the parent galley .NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management N-1APPENDIX N: DENIED COMMUNICATIONS ENVIRONMENT Part A: SUBSISTENCE SUPPORT IN A COMMUNICATIONS DEGRADED / COMMUNICATIONS DENIED ENVIRONMENT Introduction ......................................................................................................................... 1000 NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management N-2APPENDIX N: DENIED COMMUNICATIONS ENVIRONMENT Part A: SUBSISTE NCE SUPPO RT IN A COMMUNICATIONS DEGRADED / COMMUNICATIO NS DENIED ENVIRONMENT 1000 INTRODUCTION 1. GENERAL . Since t he end of t he C old War, t he naval l ogistics force has p rogressively traded aw ay com bat e ffectiveness and survivability i n the pursuit o f pea cetime efficiency and cost- saving so lutions. As a result, an i ncreasingly dang erous se curity env ironment t hreatens our ability to sustain protracted combat operations in a contested maritime environment. To meet this challenge, the Navy must adopt a war-fighting approac h to logistic s support incorporating the fundamentals of man-oeuvre warfare designed to maintain maritime superiority. As such, our peac etime logistics force must be agile, dis tributed and maneuverable in quantity and quality to deliver responsive, uninterrupted sustainment, to any joint force maritime component commander. Food service is of no exception. There may be many instances where a ship needs to order subs istence in s upport of their menu while conducting operations in an is olated part of the world or wartime steaming in a communications degraded or communications denied environment. Traditionally subs istence support for Navy ships has been overly reliant on ship-t o-shore information or communication exchanges in placing orders sustaining operations of food services afloat. The traditional subsistence provisioning through the means of data transmission v ia FSM and STORESWEB will not be operational in a Communications Degraded / Communications Denied Environment (C2D2E). Therefore, the ordering process for subsistence and the sustainability for food service operations in a denied communications environment must be enabled through a push type logistics ordering system. This logistics ordering system concept will be the push of subsistence orders utilizing a phase II menu and a phas e II load list based on crew size and a specific number of days within an approved menu cycle by platform in feeding the crew. The formula used to compute the days of subsistenc e on hand with the Basic Daily Food Allowance (BDFA) is as follows: Daily cons umption dollar value: Full complement # (underway/operational) times (BDFA+ Applicable Prime Vender Allowance) Days on hand inventory: Divide by the inventory on hand by the value computed for daily consumption to compute the actual days on hand of inventory onboard. NAVSUP N432 along with Type/Fleet Commanders and Food Service SMEs are currently working on a denied communications environment policy to include a denied communications menu, ordering procedures for subsistence and menu activation schedules. NAVSUP P-486, VOL I, Appendix N (a current placeholder) will be added to the NAVSUP P-486, Revision 9 through a signed Interim Change Notic e upon c ompletion. NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management O-1APPENDIX O: PROVISION ON-LOAD PROGRAM Pa rt A: SUBSISTENCE PROVISION ON -LOAD PROGRAM Introduction ................................................................................................................... 1000 Provision Provision On-Load Contracts ........................................................................................ 1002 NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management O-2APPENDIX O: PROVISION ON-LOAD PROGRAM Part A: SUBSISTENCE PROVISION ON-LOAD PROGRAM 1000 I NTRODUCTION The subsistence provision on- load program started in October 2005 as part of the Secretary of the Navy and Chief of Naval Operation' s Quality of Life (QOL) initiative s to reduce the workload of Sailors onboard Navy ships and submarines . The current contract i s with PRIDE Industries , one of the nation's largest non- profit employers of people with disabilities . The main job of the provision on- load contracted team is to load or unload subsistence on Navy ships sufficiently and safely . Contractor load- out of food service storerooms enhances afloat QOL and reduces workload requirements for ships in port by 531 man -years annually . Shifting workload from Sailors to contractors improves Q OL for Sailors while in port, especially during the Inter -Deployment Trainin g Cycle . Contractor load- outs are defined as moving all subsistence from the delivery vehicle into dry and refrigerated storerooms onboard the ship or submarine. Minor load- outs (fresh fruit s and vegetables, dairy products, and bakery products) may requi re four to five workers for two to three hours every other day or weekly . A major load- out (significant amounts of dry and frozen products) may employ more than 100 workers for four to six hours several days each month . The previous practice of using organic working parties to load storerooms interrupted the daily routine of the ship and the work performed in individual Work Centers . Contracted workers under the current contract may be required to operate pier fork lifts and Mulags in coordination with pier and port services and/or operations . Use of a contractor to load storerooms eliminates subsistence working parties and saves approximately $15.4M in Sailors ' labor annually . Use of a contractor to load storerooms eliminates subsistence working pa rties and saves approximately 343,625 hours in Sailors ' labor annually. 1001 PR OVISION ON-LOAD SHIPBOARD AND SUBMARINE REQUIREMENTS 1.GENERAL . All Navy ships and submarines using the Provision On-Load Program must conform to current policies in support of the Subsistence Provision On-Load Contract . The requirements for all subsistence loads on Navy piers are discussed below . a.Coordination with NAVSUP FLC Stores Operator or Subsistence Stores Scheduler to Schedule a Provision On- Load for Subsistence. Note: The Navy representative shall provide anticipated provisions deliveries 72 hours in advance of required loading operations . The Government shall provide a delivery sequence schedule 24 hours in advance of all deliveries . Shorter notices may be given for emergency situations. Subsi stence delivery and port services support must be scheduled to request a working party to support all PV/Stores deliveries . A working party request require s the following steps : Provid ing ship, hull , and pier location. Provid ing start time based on provision delivery . Request ing needed support equipment (fork lift, crane, M ulag) . Provid ing approximate pallet and case count based on the subsistence provision order . NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management O-3Provid ing the n ame of the S upervisor and team . Provid ing additional notes and remarks as required . b. Provision On-load Delays . The ship or submarine stores representative for a subsistence provision on- load must ensure that all requirements and arrangements are made to eliminate all unnecessary delays . The ship or submarine stores representative must ensure that the working party is scheduled at least 30 minutes after the arranged time of the subsistence stores delivery and after any ship- scheduled evolution. I t is imperative that everything is in place and ready to begin work before the working party arrives . This includes time to begin the inventory of subsistence on the pier in verifying subsistence receipt s. These steps eliminate delays . All delays must be reported on NAVSUP FORM 4336/1 (Figure P -1) after the 15- minute grace period based on the arrival of the provisions on- load team at the previously scheduled start time of the ship or submarine provision on- load. All delays cost the Navy additional dollars so all delays must be avoided. The following are general rules for provision on- load delays: All delays are calculated in 15 minute increments. The delay report NAVSUP Form 4336/1 must be properly filled out and distributed as follows:oWhite Copy - NAVSUP FLC oYellow Copy - Ship or submarine Food Service Officer oPink Copy - Contractor Delays are properly defined as follows: oP - Pier oS - Ship oW - Weather oV - Vendor oX - Cancellation oO - Other Note: The ship or submarine representative must use common s ense when scheduling a subsistence provision on-load. Scheduling must be avoided during known drills, extreme weather conditions , and ammo or refuelling operations where pier access is limited. c.Provision On-l oad Ac tions. The ship or submarine stores representative must ens ure that the case counts on the subsistence stores receipt and the provisions on-l oad receipt, delay , and performance report match. Figure O-1 shows a Receipt, Delay, and Performance Report. All items that are listed as each for the unit of issue on the receipt must be verified to ensure that they are not counted as individual items on the provisions on -load receipt, delay, and performance report when packaged inside a case, box, or crate . An example of this is a delivery of 12 containers of spices within one crate counted as each on the receipt. This must be reported as one container on the provisions on-l oad receipt, delay, and performance report; it must not be reported as 12 individual containers. All case counts on the provis ions on-l oad receipt, delay, and performance report must match the case count on the stores receipt document before any reports are signed. The following items shall be complied with: The receipt, inspection, and stowage guidance in NAVSUP P-486, Vol I, Chapter 5, Part A, Paragraph 5000 through Paragraph 5002 and Part B, Paragraph 5100 through Paragraph 5109 shall be followed. NAVSUP FLC's Technical Point of Contact (TPOC) for the provisions On-l oad Program and the provisions on-l oad Supervisor shall work together to resolve any case count discrepancies. Ca se counts must match on both documents before signing off for the completion of the store on-l oad working party.NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management O-4The performance report must specify if all stores were loaded in a timely manner and if the number of personnel in the working party was sufficient for loading all provisions. The receipt inspector on the pier must check with the storeroom custodian before completing the delay and performance report to ensure that all discrepancies and loading issues have been identified and reported . After review of the subsistence case counts between the receipt and the POL delay and performance report t o include all reported delays, customer evaluation and provision load details; the FSO/LCS must sign the POL report for verification of data and contractor performance.NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management O-5Figur e O-1 Provision On- Load Receipt, Delay, and Performance Report NAVSUP P- 486, Vol I, Rev 9 - Food Service Management O-61002 PROVISION ON-LOAD CONTRACTS 1.GENERAL.
