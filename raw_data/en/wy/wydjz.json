For over 25 years she has used this gift supporting others using this healing modality. Combined with her experience as a Naturopath and Psychotherapist these sessions provide a profound opportunity for deep healing and transformation. Energetic Healing is an umbrella term used for the combination of techniques used to assist the energy circuits in our physical and subtle bodies to regain balance and facilitate our body's own innate healing ability. Energetic Healing takes a holistic approach that looks beyond the physical to addressing the subtle energy systems (meridians, auric bodies, chakras, nadis). Trauma, emotional and mental stress, false belief systems, physical distress, environmental stress, and other blocks to our personal growth can be stored in the energy fields of our bodies. This can impact our ability to function at our highest potential. Energetic Healing opens our consciousness to the areas we need to work through and heal in order to bring our lives into balance and maintain health, harmony and vitality. The energy field that surrounds the body holds the emotional, mental and spiritual aspects of our nature. The energetic matrix around us contains all sorts of information about what is going on in our lives. By connecting with your energy field in a session it feeds back to Lisa what is most relevant for you to know, hear, heal, awaken, transform, release or inspire at that time.

She has helped me more than I can describe with her warm and wise healing presence. She has helped me to deal with many personal and relationship issues, as well as guide me in understanding spiritual experiences. She brings a very human compassionate touch to her healing work which is insightful and highly evolved. Lisa is always honest about being on her own personal healing journey and doing her own work. This makes me respect her even more that she is not on a power trip or putting herself up there like a guru. I have always felt respected and supported on my journey by her caring and true approach. MM Naturopath Having a busy lifestyle can get in the road of listening to yourself and understanding how you really feel about a situation. The time I have spent with Lisa has made me aware of what was actually is going on for me and that I had other choices for how to handle it. The space was really comfortable and I felt completely supported by Lisa. I would highly recommend to anyone needing a deeper understanding of something important to them to try spending time with her. CJ, Marketing Manager "}
