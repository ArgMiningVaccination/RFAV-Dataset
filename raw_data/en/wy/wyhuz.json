Open Enrollment begins on Monday, October 10, 2022, and closes at 8 p.m. (ET) on Friday, October 28, 2022. Open Enrollment provides an annual opportunity to reflect upon your current benefit elections, and make any needed changes for the upcoming 2023 calendar year, including adding or removing eligible dependents. Any changes that you make to your health and welfare plans must be completed during the 2023 Open Enrollment period*, with most changes going into effect on January 1, 2023. If you choose not to take action, your existing coverage options from 2022 will roll over into 2023, with the exception of the Health Care Flexible Spending Account (HCFSA) and Dependent Day Care Flexible Spending Account (DCFSA) options, which the IRS requires you to actively re-enroll each year. Open Enrollment Fairs This year's Open Enrollment period will offer both in-person and virtual opportunities for support. We invite you to join us for the return of our traditional in- person Open Enrollment fairs where you have the opportunity to speak directly with GW benefit plan providers and receive assistance with the enrollment process. We will also be offering webinars led by our benefits' vendor partners to provide details about the 2023 benefit programs as well as tools and resources available. Benefits' vendor partners will also hold 1:1 appointments throughout Open Enrollment, providing opportunities to get personalized support.

Open Enrollment 2023 provides the opportunity to make intentional choices to build a healthier today for a brighter tomorrow. Please take a moment to review this summary of what's changing and what's staying the same for the upcoming year. Join us for a virtual Coffee Chat where we will provide an overview of your 2023 benefit offerings, highlight some of the features of the new enrollment system and recap well-being programs available to you and your family. 2023 Medical Contribution Overview For the 2023 Plan year, participating full-time faculty and staff will experience a nominal increase of 1.3% in their contributions (across all salary bands and plans*). Approximately 80% of full-time medical plan participants will see an average increase of less than $5 per month. The monthly employee contribution increase will range from less than $1 to about $11, depending on your plan, coverage level and salary band. Below are three examples of the monthly medical contribution increase for a full-time benefits- eligible employee with a salary between $50k and $90k. Please note: Contribution details for all pay frequencies will soon be available in the Open Enrollment Guide and on go.gwu.edu/2023OE . If the employee enrolls in the GW HSP or PPO for individual coverage , the medical contribution increase will be about $1 or $2 per month, respectively, for 2023. If the employee enrolls in the GW HSP with family coverage , the medical contribution increase will be about $4 per month for 2023. If the employee enrolls in the GW PPO with family coverage , the medical contribution increase will be about $8 per month for 2023. *Please note: There are no changes to the current salary bands and both the GW PPO and GW Health Savings Plan (HSP) will continue to be offered. UnitedHealthcare will continue to be the medical benefits administrator for both plans. 2023 Vision Contribution Overview For the 2023 Plan year, participating full-time faculty and staff will experience an increase of 1.5% in their contributions across all plans and coverage tiers.

There will be no changes in coverage. Pg 2 REMINDER: MFA TIER The GW PPO and HSP medical plans include a separate benefit coverage tier for Medical Faculty Associates (MFA). When GW medical plan participants see an MFA provider*, they receive lower copayments and lower employee coinsurance, helping your medical expense dollars go further because a greater portion of your care will be covered by the Plan. GW employees also have a dedicated phone number to schedule appointments at: 202-677-6000 *The MFA tier applies to professional charges by MFA providers, MFA behavioral health providers continue to be out of-network .Pg 3IRS Account Based Plan Limit Updates 2023 Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) Contribution Limits The annual maximum for the Health Care FSA will increase by $100 up to $2,850.

For those with family HSP coverage, the annual maximum for the HSA will increase by $450, from $7,300 to $7,750. GW's HSA matching contribution continues: GW will match dollar for dollar up to $600 for individuals who contribute at least $600, and up to $1,200 for those covering dependents who contribute at least $1,200. Optional Life Insurance During Open Enrollment, employees can elect up to $250K of optional employee life insurance and up to $50K of optional spouse life insurance without having to provide Evidence of Insurability (EOI). During Open Enrollment, employees who have $250K or more in optional employee life insurance can increase their coverage up to $500K without EOI. Those under $250K or not enrolled can only increase optional employee life coverage by $250K at the most without EOI. Here are a few examples of optional employee life insurance increases allowed: If you are not currently enrolled, you can elect $250K without EOI If you are currently enrolled with $100K, you can elect up to $350K without EOI If you are currently enrolled with $350K, you can elect up to $500K without EOI Here are a few examples of optional spouse life insurance increases allowed: If you are currently not enrolled in optional spouse life, you can elect $50K without EOI.
