All the HC group were injected with 2 or 3 doses of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. | Biological: the inactivated COVID-19 vaccines | receive the doses of inactivated COVID-19 vaccines | the vaccinated patients with ADs | The vaccinated patients with ADs are 18 years old, no previous history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and diagnosed with autoimmune diseases. All the group were injected with the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. | Biological: the inactivated COVID-19 vaccines | receive the doses of inactivated COVID-19 vaccines | the unvaccinated patients with ADs | The vaccinated patients with ADs are 18 years old, no previous history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and diagnosed with autoimmune diseases. All the group were not injected with the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. - Incidence of local and systemic adverse events [ Time Frame: 3 years ]One of the primary end point was the safety of the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine in adult patients with ADs compared with controls. - Concentration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein [ Time Frame: 3 years ]One of the primary end point was the immunogenicity of the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine in adult patients with ADs compared with controls. - Infection rate of COVID-19 [ Time Frame: 3 years ]One of the primary end point was the efficacy of the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine in adult patients with ADs.
