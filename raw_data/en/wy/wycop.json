The prime reason behind the evolution of this Movement is to provide a spirituo-scientific life-style to all the humanity by offering both social and individual upliftment. The core concepts are: 1) Doing Meditation sitting under a Pyramid and 2) Not expecting any benefits for teaching Meditation to other people. The great teaching from the Gita- \"karmanyeva adhikaaraste maa phaleshu kadaachana\" indicates that one should perform one's duty without expecting any gains. We are all empowered with infinite energy! We are Gods! We should always keep in mind the great Vedic statement \" aham brahmasmi \"i.e. \" I am God \". Hence, we are our own God ! We are in Pyramid Spiritual Movement to realize that we are a light unto ourselves.. \" appo deepo bhava \". Pyramids focus Cosmic Energy: It is true, that meditation can be done at all places and at all times. However, if we do meditation while sitting in a Pyramid, we will receive more universal energy, i.e. cosmic energy. The Pyramid is like a magnifying lens. Sun rays are everywhere, but if these sun-rays are focused at a point by using a magnifying lens, even a paper kept at this point will burn. If the sun-rays are not focused, the paper remains intact. Similarly, cosmic energy is everywhere. The basic source for this cosmic energy is cosmic consciousness. Cosmic energy is the basis for physical atomic energy. This cosmic energy exists everywhere. The instrument to focus this cosmic energy is the Pyramid. The word \" Pyramid \", can be split in two parts - these are 'pyra' and 'mid'. 'Pyra' means fire and 'Mid' indicates a position in the centre or in the 'middle'. When energy is focused, it gets stronger and its strength doubles or triples. If the strength is increased further, then fire emerges. So, to get the maximum energy from the pyramid, we have to sit in the middle of this fire i.e. pyra + mid ! For the focusing energy to be maximum, a pyramid should be aligned towards the true North - South at an angle of 51\u00b0 51 51. You can visualize a Pyramid while meditating: If you do not have a Pyramid near you, imagine a Pyramid and visualize you are sitting inside it for meditation. It will be effective. We can construct a Pyramid and sit inside it or we use a Pyramid cap, or we can hang a Pyramid above our heads. We can even sleep under a Pyramid and get refreshed. It has wonderful energy. We can keep water inside a Pyramid, for the entire night and drink the energy filled water. Similarly, we can keep fruits under a Pyramid and the fruits will remain afresh for a longer period due to Pyramid energy. After reading the book\" The Secret Power of Pyramids \" written by Bill Shull and Ed Petitin the year 1982, I asked my carpenter to make two Pyramids. I kept a 'brinjal' (a kind of vegetable) inside one Pyramid and kept one outside. The brinjal kept inside the Pyramid stayed fresh for about thirty days while the outside brinjal got spoiled after two days. Similarly, I used to keep my shaving razor inside a Pyramid. The razor used to last for about a month. First Pyramid Centre - Buddha Pyramid, Kurnool: In the year 1991, with the help of Shri B.V. Reddy, the \" Buddha Pyramid Meditation Centre \"was constructed in Kurnooltown. It was the first Pyramid built for meditation with a capacity of 250 people to sit inside and enjoy meditational experiences. It was observed that the maximum energy inside the Pyramid was concentrated at about one third height from its base. This place is known as the \" Kings Chamber \". At this point if we build a platform and sleep on it, our 'astral body' will emerge immediately out of the 'physical body'. The first person in India to propagate about Pyramid Energy is Shri Jiten Bhat of Baroda. Since then, many people have followed. Any one can sit in a Pyramid. The Pyramid Spiritual Societies Movement unites people and tries to bring them on this path of meditation. Pyramid is a very important scientific symbol. If we sit outside a Pyramid, while meditating, it takes about thirty minutes to get concentration, but the same can be achieved in five minutes if we sit inside it. Pyramids help in concentrating the Mind: If we place a Pyramid on a table, our mind gets focused automatically on the Pyramid. That means, mind will not run here and there but gets into the habit of focusing itself. Pyramids center our mind even from a distance. This new habit minimizes the wandering of the mind and unifies the mind. Hence, we can keep Pyramids anywhere in our house. We can remove the ill effects carried forward from our previous lives by doing Meditation. The Bhagvat Gita means \"even if you are more sinful than the most sinful one, yet, all those sins can be washed off, in one raft of Spiritual Knowledge.\" You will not get the knowledge just by reading the Bhagvad Gita. You will experience it all only through Meditation. Pyramids can be built with any material: The Power of Pyramid is widely investigated all over the World, but some have doubts about the material with which a Pyramid can be made. Some wonder if a Pyramid can be made with Iron. Some wonder whether electricity connection can be provided inside a Pyramid. Whether a fan can be fixed in the Pyramid. Or can windows be arranged for the Pyramid? Well, we can build a Pyramid as we like. Please remember only the angle should be proper, i.e. 51\u00b0 51 51. In a normal room the walls are at 90 . If these walls are bent to 51\u00b0 51 51, it will become a Pyramid. Let the material be any thing, it is fine. We can place a crystal on the top of the Pyramid (under the roof), to increase its energy. If we go to other worlds by 'astral travel', we can see wonderful Pyramids. There are so many worlds and higher technologies. But, in every world there is Pyramid technology. Pyramid Spiritual Centers for Every Town: Pyramid Spiritual Centers are coming up in every town and village. In every village there should be a common Pyramid, where everyone can perform group meditation. Smaller Pyramids can be hung in individual houses. One or two persons can sit under these Pyramids. However, since Group Meditation is more beneficial, there should be a common Pyramid for every area. Every town and city should have their own Pyramid Meditation Center. PSSM actually began as \"The Kurnool Spiritual Society\" in Kurnool.The first Pyramid Center is the \"Buddha Pyramid Meditation Center\", which was constructed in 1991. Later on in the year 1996, Uravakondain Anantapur District became the location for the second Pyramid known as \"Lobsang Rampa- Pyramid Spiritual Center\". Another Pyramid Center known as \"Agastya Pyramid Meditation Center\", which can accommodate above 1000 people, was constructed in AnantapurTown in the year 1999. Later on \"Pavana Putra Pyramid Spiritual Center\" was constructed in Guntakal and Vyasa Pyramid Spiritual Center\" was Vempallyof Kadapa District. The headquarters of PSSM, Bengaluru, called Pyramid Valley International, has one of the biggest Meditational Pyramids named as \"The Maitreya Buddha Pyramid\". It has a capacity of Buddha Pyramid which is one of the most powerful energy spots on the earth right now. Due to the relentless efforts of Pyramid Masters all over India, hundreds of Pyramids have been built to-date for meditation. Over 100 large Pyramids with capacities ranging from 50 people to 1,000 people were built in several towns of India enabling powerful Group Meditation sessions. Additionally, at least over 5,000 roof top Pyramids were built by individuals in their homes, to act as in-house meditation halls. Apart from this, PSSM has embarked on building Mega Pyramids that can hold thousands of meditators at a time to help effect positive global changes in the shortest possible time. The Pyramids are built in order to represent the internally stored fire-energy and divine-force within ourselves (From \" The Pleiadian Mission \" by Randolph Winters). There may be much more about Pyramid Power than that we are currently aware of. Hence, we should keep experimenting and learning further and further about the Power of Pyramids and develop scientific concepts and scientific methods. "}
