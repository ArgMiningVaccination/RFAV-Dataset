AIIMS has been active in sharing its knowledge and expertise through CMEs, Conferences and Workshops.Under short term training scheme, the institute providedpostgraduate training to 42 foreign nationals including 8WHO fellows, elective training to 49 foreign graduatesand short term and long term training to 845 doctors andother health-care professionals from all over the country. The institute is committed to high quality and standards in research and medical education, besides providingcompassionate patient care services. Our faculty andscientists are engaged in frontline research in areas like human genomics, immunogenetics with organ transplant programme, molecular medicine, structural biology andprotein structure, aiming at new drug development. Theyare also practising newer diagnostics and interventionprocedures through imaging sciences in cardiovascularand neurosciences. Ultrasound guided procedures in fetalmedicine, neonatology and cancer are also being routinelypractised. Technology-driven innovations for patient careusing biocompatible implant devices, like cardiac stents,cochlear implants, knee & hip joints through collaborativebio-design are intensely experimented and clinicallypracticed. Many platform based technologies for diagnosis of diseases and undertaking research in pathology, laboratorymedicine, virology, medicine and pediatrics are deployedin the institute.Pioneering patient care works in areas like cardiothoracic surgery, neurosurgery, orthopedics, corneaplasty andretinal therapy, diabetes, robotic and other minimallyinvasive surgery have been done by my faculty. The doctors at the trauma-care centre have conducted clinical research and developed a safe practice protocol andguideline for acute and emergency care medicine. Newerskill acquisition methods through medical simulation systems for medical education including practical skill development in experimental laboratories and surgicalsituations are being put into operation for the benefit ofstudents and resident doctors. They are learning routine and critical care medicine at various stations such as Anesthesia and Trauma care areathrough these medical simulations. We have also a strongrural health training programme at Ballabhgarh community hospital for training both under- and post graduates in rural and public health practices. During the last academic year the faculty and the scientists of the institute have published over 1700 research papers in national and international journals, written books and monograms and also contributed a large number ofchapters in books. Over 500 young scientists at differentpositions like research fellows, research associates and Ph.D. students have been engaged in significant research projects. 632 research projects are in progress and theybrought extramural funds of Rs. 65.4 crore, which is 25%increase from last year's funds and that was very creditable. 146 research projects were successfully completed this year, bringing new knowledge and useful research dataat the institute. Rs. 3 crore institutional funds were also distributed to young faculty for undertaking 126 new research projects, involving newer areas like stroke, braintumour, stem cell studies, drug designing, protein research,genetics and immunology. This was a commendable initiative by the research section, which has been fully organised and augmented under a Dean and a Sub-Dean.A Research advisory council with Director, AIIMS as itschairman took several steps to enhance our research capabilities including identifying cutting edge research areas during the year as evidenced from the projectsundertaken and publications made during the year underreport. During the institute's foundation day celebration on the 25th September, 18 faculty members were awarded forAnnual Report 2012-13 243their outstanding research publications during the preceding year with cash prizes and certificates ofexcellence. A health exhibition was also shown on thisoccasion showcasing institute's contribution to health sciences. This was a reflection of the kind of research activities undertaken during the past 3 years. For the firsttime a \"AIIMS Foundation Day Lecture\" was institutedand Professor Robert Huber from Germany, adistinguished scientist and a Nobel laureate gave thislecture on protein structure and its impact on modernmedicine. This was a very inspiring experience for theyoung doctors and students. Presently, the AIIMS hospitals have a total bed strength of 2424, including day care beds in dentistry. During thepreceding year, the institute attended to 25,78,396 patientsin OPD and Casualty, admitted 1,72,036 patients and performed 1,37,019 surgical procedures. The institute has maintained an ideal parameter in patient-care serviceswith an average bed occupancy of over 80%, and averagehospital stay of about 6 days. The AIIMS hospitals reporteda net death rate of below 3%, with a combined crudeinfection rate of 8.3 % in the hospital. New postgraduate courses (DM, MCh, MD) were started last year, in pulmonary medicine, surgical oncology andgeriatric medicine. Departments of Geriatric Medicineand Pulmonary Medicine and Sleep Disorders have beenestablished. These departments are running OPD andseparate wards for indoor patients. The work on buildinga Convergence Centre, which will house all modern platform based state-of-the-art technology for our faculty, scholars and students to undertake research is in progressis progressing at a fast speed. It will indeed become theknowledge hub which will allow us to store and manageour large clinical material and research data for enhancingour capability in research. This block should be completedby next year. While AIIMS is recognized as a national symbol of excellence in medical sciences and patient care, it is alsointensely watched and monitored by the Government, themedia and the people at large. So we are constantly strivingfor continuous improvement and development and also focus on newer areas like translational medicine through collaborative efforts. It is true that our quality care topeople has attracted a large patient load which has forcedus to compromise on some of our priorities, affecting theacademic and research activities of the Institute. This isindeed a big challenge for all of us. We have to protect its academic character to maintain its stated objective.

Nestled inthe karmabhoomi of Mahatma Gandhi, in Sevagram, thisInstitute was founded by Dr Sushila Nayar in 1969. Kasturba Hospital has the distinction of being the only hospital in the country which was started by the Father ofthe Nation himself. Over the past 44 years the Institutehas grown to be one of the top 25 reputed colleges of the country and has been accredited by National Assessmentand Accreditation Council (NAAC) in 'A' grade. The credit goes to Govt. of India, Govt. of Maharashtra andthe Kasturba Health Society (KHS) who share theexpenditure in the ratio of 50:25:25 respectively. In one of the judgments passed by the full Bench of Bombay High Court in 1998 Mahatma Gandhi Instituteof Medical Sciences (MGIMS) has been designated \"asa unique Institute with a class of its own\". This is because all these years MGIMS has stuck to its mission statement and has totally committed itself to the pursuit ofprofessional excellence by evolving an integrated patternof medical education that seeks to produce doctors who possess clinical acumen of global standards, a sound community orientation, good communication skills,integrity, accountability and humane approach. It has alsostuck to its vision of providing accessible and affordable health care primarily to underprivileged rural communities. The Institute believes that Gandhian values and principles are as relevant today as ever before. The entranceexamination to the MBBS course includes a separate qualifying paper on Gandhian Thought. The students and staff of the Institute adhere to a unique code of conduct,where they are expected to wear handwoven khadi,participate in shramdan, attend all-religion prayer on every Friday evening, abstain from non-vegetarian food, alcohol and tobacco. The Institute offers MCI recognized degrees and diplomas in 19 postgraduate disciplines and PhDs in seven departments. Since 1991, all graduates of the Institute have to serve for two years in rural areas and 96 non-governmental rural organizations have joined hands withthe institute to fulfill this dream. This rural service is a mandatory eligibility criterion for getting post-graduation in this Institute. The Report of the Task Force on MedicalEducation of the National Rural Health Mission spells outthe need to draw inspiration upon MGIMS Sevagram's, initiatives and experience in curriculum innovation and rural placement of its graduates. It suggests launching aparticipatory exercise with MGIMS and other like-mindedinstitutions, so that national guidelines can be formulated. Several such visionary and innovative education strategies which started from the Institute have now been adoptedby the government. In September 2011 MGIMS was accredited with 'A' certificate by National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) and the certificate was awarded at theAnnual Report 2012-13 261hands of Prof. Ved Prakash Chairman UGC at a function held in Bangaluru. On 22nd December 2011, MGIMS wasawarded the WHO Award for Excellence in PrimaryHealthcare by the ICICI Lombard and CNBC TV 18 India Health Care Awards. More than 4000 health care service providers had participated for these awards invarious categories. Through these awards CNBC-TV18tries to put spot light on India's finest health care providers.

The first session of the course has commenced in July 2012. MGIMS goes Wifi: The hospital is fully computerized and HIS installed is working most efficiently since 2005. Now in order to make our faculty, students and staff more efficient and well versed in knowledge of all kinds, theInstitute has installed Broad Band (Wifi) facility all overthe hospital and campus for easy access of information through internet. It has also distributed ipads, Mc Books to its students and faculty on interest free loan to be paidin installments. Skills laboratory to be started: The construction of a skills laboratory is afoot under the Medical Education Unit. Several mannequins and simulators have already beenprocured. The simulators include those used to teachstudents basic and advanced life support, resuscitation, obstetric and surgical skills etc. The skills lab will help students hone their clinical and procedural skills in anartificially simulated environment before applying themon real patients. Hospital Activities The Kasturba Hospital which has graduallyexpanded from a 15 bedded Hospital to a 780 bedded hospitalprimarily caters to therural populace as threefourth of the patientsthat visit our hospital come from rural areas. Besides Wardhadistrict the patient loadcomes to us fromadjoining parts of Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh andChhattisgarh. It acts as a tertiary care hospital with all the modern health care amenities but provides health services at affordable cost. It has a unique insurancescheme in which this year 50563 families, equivalent to205742 members were insured. In line with our objective to serve the poor, MGIMS had submitted a proposal to Govt. of India and the Govt. of Maharashtra to set up India's first rural Tertiary Cancer Centre at the Institute so that we can providecomprehensive cancer care including prevention, earlydetection, treatment, palliation and rehabilitation to the poor Total Beds 780 Teaching-660 Service Beds-100 Private beds-20 Blood Donations Camp 47Annual Report 2012-13 262cancer patients from rural areas who neither want nor can afford to go to cities for their ailment. The proposalhas met the approval of both the agencies and funds havebeen released to set up the above centre at the MGIMS. MGIMS starts Hospital for Mother and Child Care at Melghat: Melghat, a tribal region in Amravati district has high incidence of malnutrition and child mortality. Thisis due to lack of basic health facilities and nutritional support in the region. KHS has already been running an OPD and a 6 bedded hospital under its Tribal ResearchHealth Project (TRHP) for the tribal people at Utawali,Melghat since the last 13 years. A new unit with another 30 beds for women and children is proposed to be constructed. For the time being inauguration was doneand OPD was started in the old hospital on 1st January2012. It is expected that the antenatal care and other facilities, along with health education of women in this remote region will finally result in health care reachingthe mothers and children of Melghat. Number of patientsavailing the facility has already increased, major operations like caesarian section and Hysterectomy's have been conducted for the first time. A further impetus to theprogramme was given when doctors from MGIMSparticipated in a multi-disciplinary health camp on 23-24 March 2012. A total of 236 patients availed the services of the doctors at the camp and 24 patients needing majorinterventions were referred to Sevagram. It was achallenge to perform major surgeries in the resource - poor settings and surgeons from the Departments of Surgery, Orthopedics, ENT and Obst. and Gynae met thischallenge head on. This camp has created a lot of goodwilland trust in this tribal area and the MGIMS team came in for a lot of appreciation from the villagers. Enhancement in facilities for the patients: The proposal to add another 192 beds to the Kasturba Hospitalis nearing completion and the building is almost ready for occupation.The Hospital Information System successfully installed Computerized Radiography (CR) RadiologyInformation System (RIS) and Picture Archiving andCommunication System(PACS) in the department of Radio-diagnosis. This system enables radiology images to be sent digitally to the clinicians in the OPDs and Wardsand also ensures convenient storage and retrieval ofimages. It does away with the cumbersome process of first developing the X rays, then the patients carrying it with him and ultimately losing it or not being able to produceit on follow up. In the year 2010 the old single slice CTscan was replaced with a higher end model of 8 slices CT Scan. This year the old MRI will be replaced by 1.5tesla machine to get better resolution and more advancedradiography. Laser Unit acquired in Ophthalmology: Refractive errors account for 7% of blindness which can be correctedby changing the curvature of the cornea. Wardha district alone has approximately 1000 such cases and mostly in the young population; Lasix surgery can correct this refractive error as an outpatient procedure. The Institutehas acquired an Excimer Laser Unit with Microtome and Corneal Topography system in the Ophthalmology department becoming one of the very few institutes topossess this equipment. Clinical Forensic Medicine Unit: A clinical forensic medicine unit is planned to be started in the Accident andEmergency Centre in August 2012. Manned by experts from the Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, this unit will help clinicians and casualtymedical officers to deal with medico-legal cases with more ease and confidence.

Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP)Background Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) was launched with World Bank assistance in November 2004.The project envisaged data collection on a number ofcommunicable as well as non-communicable disease riskfactors, but later focused on epidemic prone diseases onlyin 2007 on the recommendations of international and national experts. The project was extended for 2 years up to March 2012. The IDSP is proposed to continue asIntegrated Disease Surveillance Programme in 12th FiveYear Plan (2012-17) from domestic budget only. Annualoutlay for 2012-13 (Rs. 63 Crore) has been approved. Project Components /circle6 Integration and decentralization of surveillance activities through establishment of surveillance unitsat Centre, State and District level. /circle6 Human Resource Development - Training of StateSurveillance Officers, District Surveillance Officers,Rapid Response Team and other Medical and Paramedical staff on principles of disease surveillance. /circle6 Use of Information Communication Technology forcollection, collation, compilation, analysis anddissemination of data. /circle6 Strengthening of public health laboratories.Annual Report 2012-13 267Current Status of IDSP Implementation Surveillance units have been established at all State and District Headquarters (SSUs, DSUs). Central Surveillance Unit (CSU) is integrated in the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi. Human Resources and Training Considering the non-availability of health professionals in the field of epidemiology, microbiology and entomology at district and state level, Health Ministry approved the recruitment of trained professionals under National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) in order to strengthen the disease surveillance and response system by placing one epidemiologist each at state/district headquarters, one microbiologist and entomologist each at the State headquarters. The recruitment of 301 epidemiologists, 61 microbiologists and 22 entomologists has been completed under IDSP till September 2012. Induction training to 261 epidemiologists, 56 microbiologists and 16 entomologists has been completed. Training of State/District Surveillance Teams (Training of Trainers) and Rapid Response T eams (RRTs) has been completed in all 35 States/UTs. The main focus of training for State level participants is on basics of disease surveillance, concepts of epidemiology and data management, whereas the district training focuses on correct procedures of data collection, compilation and reporting and outbreak response. A need based special two-week disease surveillance and Field Epidemiology Training Programme (FETP) have been initiated for the District Surveillance Officers. 530 District Surveillance Officers have already been trained in this special 2- week FETP. IT Network The IT network has been established at 776 sites (connecting all the State/UTs and district headquarters, medical colleges, Infectious Disease Hospitals (IDHs), and premier health institutions) for data entry, data transference, analysis and video conferencing with the help of National Informatics Centre (NIC) and Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) to provide the terrestrial and satellite connectivity. However, satellite connectivity is not available since September 2010. Recently, ISRO has allocated the bandwidth and has started migration of network from GSAT-3 to GSAT-12 to restart the satellite connectivity.IDSP has started one stop portal (http://www.idsp.nic.in) for data access and transmission, trend analysis and free resources like training material, guidelines, advisories for health personnel related to disease surveillance. A 24x7 call center was established in February 2008 to receive disease alerts on a Toll Free telephone number(1075). The information received was provided to theStates/Districts surveillance Units for investigation and response. The call centre was extensively used during H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009 and dengue outbreakin Delhi in 2010. About 2.77 lakh calls were received frombeginning till June 2012, out of which more than thirtyfive thousand calls were related to Influenza A H1N1.IDSP direct contract with vendor for call centre has been terminated from 1 July 2012 as Health Ministry has approved outsourcing of call centre through NIC/NICSI.The Call Centre will be made functional soon. Data ManagementUnder IDSP data are collected on epidemic prone diseases on weekly basis (Monday-Sunday). The information is collected on three specified reporting formats, namely \"S\" (suspected cases), \"P\" (presumptivecases) and \"L\" (laboratory confirmed cases) filled byHealth Workers, Clinicians and Laboratory staffrespectively. The weekly data gives information on thetrends and seasonality of diseases. Whenever there is a rising trend of illnesses in any area, it is investigated by the Rapid Response Team (RRT) to diagnose and controlthe outbreak. Data analysis and actions are beingundertaken by respective State/District Surveillance Units.Emphasis is now being laid on reporting of surveillancedata from major hospitals. Presently, more than 90% districts in the country report weekly surveillance data on epidemic prone diseases through e-mail or portal. In addition, States and districts have been asked to notify the outbreaks immediately to the system. On an averageof 30-35 outbreaks are reported every week to CentralSurveillance Unit (CSU). A total of 553 outbreaks of epidemic prone diseases were reported and responded through IDSP in 2008, 799 outbreaks in 2009, 990outbreaks in 2010 and 1675 outbreaks in 2011. In 2012,1311 outbreaks have been reported till September. Earlieronly a few outbreaks were reported in the country by theStates/UTs. Media scanning and verification cell was established under IDSP in July 2008 to detect and share media alerts withAnnual Report 2012-13 268the concerned States/Districts for verification and response. A total of 1937 media alerts were reported fromJuly 2008 to September 2012. Majority of alerts wererelated to diarrhoeal, foodborne and vector borne diseases. Strengthening of Laboratories 50 identified district laboratories are being strengthened for diagnosis of epidemic prone diseases. These labs arealso being supported by a contractual microbiologist to manage the lab and funds for reagents and consumables. Till date 35 labs in 25 states have become functional. Moredistrict public health labs will be strengthened for diagnosis/testing of epidemic prone diseases in the next five years. In 9 identified States (Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Bengal), a referral lab network hasbeen established by utilizing the existing 65 functional labs in the medical colleges and various other major centers in the States and linking them with adjoining districts forproviding diagnostic services for epidemic prone diseasesduring outbreaks. Based on the experience gained, the plan will be implemented in the remaining 26 States/UTs by linking at least 125 additional medical college labs withthe districts in next five years. In addition, a network of 12 laboratories has been developed for Influenza surveillance in the country. 11 labs have become functional, while the lab at Shillong willbecome functional shortly.

II Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI - Pilot) Project Life expectancy in India has been increasing steadily for more than 50 years. Now approximately 65 years, theAnnual Report 2012-13 325UN Population Division (2007) projects it to reach 70 by 2020 and 75 by 2045. These figures mask the wide variation across states, with concomitant variations in shares of the older population. The share of the population aged 60and above is projected to increase from the current 7%to 20% (335 million people) in 2050 and of those over 80from 1% to 3% (51 million people) (United Nations, 2007). This rapid rate of population aging presents policy makers with urgent economic and social challenges. Data are lacking on the health and economic security of India'sgrowing elderly population and concern is mounting abouthow this expanding group will support itself. By assemblinga research team of demographers, economists, health, andpolicy experts, the proposed Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI) aims to take stock of the health and socioeconomic wellbeing of India's elderly population withthe aim of using their findings to inform the design ofpolicies that can protect and support the growing elderlycommunity. LASI will be positioned to evaluate the effect of changing policies on behavioral outcomes and create valuable longitudinal data base for research and policy on ageingpopulation in India. LASI focuses on health and wellbeingelderly population in India. LASI is conceptuallycomparable to Health and Retirement Study (HRS) inUS and Europe (SHARE) and is harmonized with its sister surveys in Asia - such as the Chinese Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) and the KoreanLongitudinal Study of Aging (KLoSA) - to allow for cross-country comparison. LASI also takes account of featuresunique to India, including its institutional and culturalcharacteristics. LASI Pilot Results Dissemination LASI Pilot results dissemination was conducted on March 14-15 2012 with presentation of four papers 1) LASI Pilot:Overview, vision and goals 2) Economic Wellbeing of OlderIndians: LASI Pilot Results 3) Markers and Drivers ofHealth of Older Indians) Social and Family Network and Wellbeing of Older Indians in the International Conference on Policy Research and Data Needs To Meet theChallenges and Opportunities of Population Ageing inAsia\" organized by the Indian National Science Academy, the U.S. National Academy Sciences, Asian ScienceAcademy, New Delhi. The third advisory committee meeting of LASI was conducted on 13 March at Indian National ScienceAcademy, New Delhi. The LASI team shared the Pilot field work experience, preliminary results and obtained advice on plans for the main wave. The meeting was attended by more than 30 participants of the LASI national and international advisory board. Three papers were published in volume on Ageing in Asia published by the National Academy Press, US. LASI Pilot data made available online in December 2011 and there has been more than 250 LASI pilot data downloads by researchers worldwide. LASI Main Wave: LASI is designed as a longitudinal panel study health and ageing and first main wave is designed to a national sample of 50,000 persons in age 45+. The first main wave was planned to be launched in 2012 and was projected to follow-up for the next 25 years with a follow-up survey for every two years. LASI research and sampling design allows national and state representative samples for 29 states and 2 union territories, comprising more than 99.9% of India's population. These data will also provide a much-needed foundation for scientific research and policy making related to aging in India. Through comparative studies, LASI will contribute to scientific insights and policy development in other countries because of its harmonized design with parallel international studies. LASI will ultimately be part of a worldwide effort aimed at understanding how different institutions, cultures, and policies can influence, and prepare for, population ageing. Project funding and collaborating institutionsThe LASI-Pilot project is supported by a grant from the National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes ofHealth (NIH), USA. LASI main is planned to be undertaken under the aegis of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Governmentof India.

Planning on report writing started in September, in which chapterization and data also was done. Along with theseactivities, preparation for bringing out 5 scientific papers and national dissemination is going on. IV. Comprehensive Nutrition Survey in Maharashtra (CNSM) Background and Objectives: The 2005-06 National Family Health Survey (NFHS-3) has been used as the foundation for advocacy, policy andprogramme action for maternal and child nutrition; since 2006 no estimates of the nutrition situation of childrenand women were made available to assess the impact ofthe interventions implemented. In view of this situation, the Government of Maharashtra endorsed the need to implement the Comprehensive Nutrition Survey inMaharashtra (2012) to assess the impact of the StateNutrition Mission and provide the evidence base for the Mission's Phase-II. The findings of the survey will help decision makers develop appropriate policies, strategies and programmesfor the delivery of the essential nutrition interventions to those who need it most when they most need it. The financial and technical assistance was provided by theUNICEF. The Maharashtra Comprehensive Nutrition Survey 2012 is the first ever state-specific nutrition survey with a focus on infants and children under two years and their mothers. The specific objectives are: In order to serve as the baseline for the State Nutrition Mission to develop strategies for statewide implementation of the 10 essential nutrition interventions with a focus - on the most vulnerableand unreached pockets of rural, urban and tribal areas.The specific objectives of the survey are as follows: 1. To study the current feeding practices among infants and young children (0-24 months) 2. To assess the nutritional status of children below five years through anthropometric measurements(weight, height and mid-upper arm circumference) 3. To assess the mothers' food consumption pattern including their diet during pregnancy and lactationthrough a food frequency questionnaire. Progress as on 30th November 2012 Sampling: Sampling design for this survey was suggested similar to NFHS-3 so that estimates of this survey can becompared with the results of NFHS-3 to get trend of childnutrition indicators. The rural and urban samples was drawn separately using a mutli-stage stratified sampling procedure. The rural sample was selected in two stages,with the selection of Primary Sampling Units (PSUs),which are villages, with probability proportional to population size (PPS) at the first stage, followed by random selection of households within each PSUs in the secondstage among those households where at least one childAnnual Report 2012-13 327under two years was residing. In urban areas, a three- stage sampling procedure was followed using the wardas the first stage. The main reason for suggesting a three-stage-sample design in urban areas is that the urban wards are quite large and it is difficult to do house listing in the ward. Although data on lowest unit of urban areas i.e.,Census Enumeration Blocks (CEB) the lowest unit ofcensus enumeration in urban areas were collected, data not published in the Primary Census Abstract (PCA). For this reason, while selecting the urban sample, in the firststage, wards were selected with PPS sampling; and inthe next stage, one CEB was selected by PPS from each selected ward. In the final stage, households were selected randomly within CEB. Hundred rural and 100 urbanPSUs were selected as primary sampling units (PSUs) inthe state. The household to be interviewed were selected with equal probability from the part of house list which containshouseholds with at least one child under two years in eacharea using systematic sampling. Based on this, sample size was calculated in the following manner similar to the calculations followed for Muti-Indicator Cluster Survey. To get nutritional indicators bysex/gender rural and urban areas, the sample size is raised approximately three times and proposed sample size is 3000 children of 0-24 months. Considering the percentageof urban population according to 2011 census, it is proposedto have 1500 children from rural and 1500 from urban areas. The sample size is sufficiently large enough to facilitate overall tribal and slum level estimates with asomewhat lower, but still acceptable level of precision.However, if it was felt essential to have separate estimates for tribal population, then number of PSUs can be increased in the tribal block of state of Maharashtra. House listing Training: In order to identify the household with under two years children and their mothers, house listing was carried out in the selected PSUs both in rural and urban areas. Before initiating the house listingoperation, 3 days intensive training was given duringJanuary 4-6, 2012 at Pune to the 25 experienced personnels appointed by the survey agency i.e. Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics, Pune. A details ofhouse listing and mapping manual was provided to thetrained field staff. Preparation of questionnaire: Bilingual questionnaires in Marathi and English were used to collect data. Fourtypes of questionnaires were used, namely the Village questionnaire, Household questionnaire, Womanquestionnaire and Child questionnaire. The Villagequestionnaire included information on the availability ofICDS, Health and other services. The Householdquestionnaire included questions on the socio-economiccharacteristics of the household such as availability ofassets, sanitation and hygiene, access to iodized salt andother selected food security indicators. The Woman'squestionnaire included information on women'scharacteristics, work status, marriage and fertility,antenatal care, delivery care, life style indicators andanthropometric measurements. The Child questionnaireincluded information on children's characteristics, feedingand care practices, immunization, and anthropometryincluding weight and height. Pretesting of the questionnaires: Pretesting of the questionnaires were carried out both in rural and urbanareas i.e. in Kondyachi Wadi in Panvel Tahsil andMankhurd slum in Mumbai sub-urban during 26-31December 2011. Based on the field experiences inpretesting, necessary changes were incorporated andaccordingly the questionnaires were finalized for the mainsurvey. Preparation of Manuals: Two types of manuals were prepared for the main training and survey namely;Investigators Mannual and Supervisors & Editors Manualconsisting of interview techniques, illustrative diagramsrelated to measurement of height and weight of motherand child, information about vaccines, symptoms of someimportant diseases, age conversion chart, festival chart,consistency check for editing the fill-in questionnaires etc. Investigators selection and Training: On the basis of qualification and experience, A total of seventy-nineinvestigators were selected for different districts ofMaharashtra. Extensive training for these investigatorswas conducted for eight days including two days each offield practice and feed back of the field visit. TheInvestigators training was held during January 23-30, 2012. Field Work: The field work schedule was planned and carried out from 06th February to 30th April 2012.
