When she released her film, DPT: Vaccine Roulette, the world of public health was forever altered (Offit, 2011). Especially back in the 1980's, there was always a certain trust amongst doctors and patients. Parents would routinely bring their children in for the very important DTP vaccination without any second-guessing occurring. This vaccination, as with many other vaccinations, was crucial for protecting children from deadly infectious diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (Offit, 2011). However, when Thompsons' documentary surfaced, many parents soon went into a frenzy worrying if they made a mistake by vaccinating In the United States of America, childhood immunizations have prevented an estimated twenty-one million hospitalizations and seven-hundred and twenty thousand lives among children born in the last twenty years (CDC). In recent discussions of childhood immunization, a controversial issue has been whether the amount and composition of these vaccines being administered intravenously, to enhance the body's immunity, are in fact safe for the human body at such a vulnerable stage in its systematic development. Consequently, this has brought about a belief among a division of people who believe that their child shouldn't be vaccinated. Anti-vaxxers commonly believe vaccinations can cause autism spectrum disorder, contain harmful ingredients that constitute Mandatory vaccinations for children in public schools have been the center of much debate since laws were first developed to regulate immunization. Fears from parents about side effects and adverse reactions have steered many away from wanting to vaccinate their children despite the numerous infectious diseases they prevent. These debates have gotten in the way of progression in schools for preventing the spread of disease. To me, the risks of not vaccinating children are far greater than the risks of adverse reactions. Parents who don't vaccinate their children put them and others at risk because it allows normally preventable disease to continue to spread. In the science sector, there are many arguments whether science is beneficial for humans or is it a curse upon us, this debate is also applicable to child vaccination. Child vaccination is a sensitive health topic that parents and doctors argue about, were some say that vaccination can be harmful for their children, others say that it might prevent their children from getting sick. What is Child vaccination? Child vaccination is the process of injecting dead bacteria or viruses in our body for our immune system to recognise as a pathogen^1 and fight that particular pathogen. Also the pathogen is being recognised by our body for the future, so our body can defeat this particular pathogen faster in the future and a person won't get the disease. One of the most controversial matters of today is the HPV vaccine. While some individuals view the vaccine as a preventative measure, others view it as the cause of a variety of medical issues, as well as, a free pass to be promiscuous. New York Times' personal health columnist Jane Brody addresses some of the alleged cons associated with the HPV vaccine in her article \"The Underused HPV Vaccine\". Brody's purpose in writing this article is to inform about the misconceptions about the vaccine and, ultimately, convince the adult readers that it is more beneficial to be vaccinated than harmful. Brody's appeal to logic, application of ethos, and choice of diction effectively convinces the audience that the HPV vaccine should be utilized to their The article \"Should Anti-Vaxers be shamed or Persuaded\", is about how Anti-vaccination protesters should not be bullied or shamed into agreeing with the opposing viewpoint. The author distinguishes the difference between, bullying them into submission, and persuading them to the right side. Though not a parent, the author believes that kids should be vaccinated except in rare cases. He also goes on to say that he would urge parents with the impulse to shame and insult to try and persuade anti-vaxers with facts and numbers. Friedersdorf goes on to say, \"Not only would I definitely vaccinate my own kid if I had one -- the case is so strong that, were standard vaccinations more expensive, I'd spend 20 percent of my income to get Requiring vaccinations is a highly debatable topic in the United States today. An article by Ronald Bayer, \"The continuing tensions between individual rights and public health,\" is one of the most reliable sources in the case study. The author has a PhD from the University of Chicago and focuses his research on issues of social justice and ethical matters. Bayer has also previously been a consultant to the World Health Organization on ethical issues related to public health. This makes him very knowledgeable about the topic and a highly credible source. In the article he discusses what makes vaccinations a controversy among Americans. He says, \"it would be more honest and in the long term more protective of public health to acknowledge that intervention is sometimes necessary to protect individuals from their own foolish or dangerous behaviour\" (Bayer 4). This statement shows his support for vaccinations. In her article she says \"unvaccinated people can spread the measles to babies who are to young to be vaccinated and to children who cannot be vaccinated due to medical reasons \". Also she says to her readers \"Since the MMR vaccine is only 97 percent effective, vaccinated people are at risk as well.\" These facts and examples help the reader understand more about why Amy feels parents should vaccinate their children and also gives meaning to why they should follow-through with The epidemic of smallpox is one of the most groundbreaking moments in medical history. It created the usage of vaccination to be extremely normal. Smallpox had manages to kill millions of people, which was a large part of the population at the time. So when a Edward Jenner came up with a vaccine that could treat it and doctors were easily able to diagnose people with it. It only took around fourteen year to see that smallpox was no longer something people needed to fear. A vaccine is defined as any preparation used as a preventive inoculation to confer immunity against a specific disease, usually employing a harmless form of the disease agent, as killed or weakened bacteria or viruses, to stimulate antibody production. Essentially a biological To vaccinate or not to vaccinate? That is the question. Vaccination has sparked heated debate since its development amongst the following groups; parents, naturopaths, medical professionals, etc. Fuel has been added to the fire of the vaccine debate by the media and anti-vaxxer fear mongering tactics, making it hard for those considering vaccination, to decipher fact from myth. It is vital that we first understand the facts rather than believing the latest rumor before making an informed decision to vaccinate or not. This is the aim of this report. Through analytical research presented in this report I have come to the conclusion that vaccines are not only crucial and beneficial but that everyone who is eligible should be vaccinated, as that Unfortunately, Bihr is not able to persuade the audience members who hold negative attitudes on vaccinations. The statements by Lillvis, Kirkland, & Frick (2014) and the Pew Research Center (2015) present evidence that audience members do not find vaccines effective and will not change their attitudes, or personal feelings on the topic. Since attitudes are difficult to change, Bihr's different forms of rational arguments and value of family are unable to alter audience views on the topic. This could be from a rise in 'conscientious objection' http://www.immunise.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing.nsf/Content/acir-cons-object-hist.htm, a document that exempts children from being immunized based on various reasons, including parental beliefs, which will be ineffective of 1st January 2016.The 'Conscientious Objection' Data shows a large rise in people objecting to the immunization of their children. December 31st 1999, only 0.23% (4, 271) of children are exempted using conscientious objection. Meanwhile, on the31st of December 2014, 1.77% (39, 523) of children were exempt. WHY? Many people may think that vaccination is a bad thing, that instead of preventing it causes illness, that is not natural. Natural or not, there are many reasons as to why we should vaccinate us and the younger generation. Most of the time children don't like vaccination because it hurt, but is the responsibility of a parent to seek the wellbeing of his or her child. Vaccination it's a preventive measure of various diseases. Unfortunately, things like the anti-vaccination movement, the misinformation on the Internet, and the believe that vaccination causes more damage than is worth, have led our society to think that it's right not to vaccinate. Modern medicine provides people with the ability to protect themselves from the world's most fatal diseases. Merely a century ago, it was not uncommon for a child to die as a result of diseases such as polio, pertussis, and tuberculosis. Today, it is highly unlikely for a person to contract these diseases, let alone die from them. However, refusal of vaccinations has been increasing throughout the years due to the anti-vaccination movement. This movement declares mandatory vaccines unconstitutional and vaccinations overall as the cause of autism. Unfortunately, the anti-vaccination movement is becoming increasingly popular due to individuals' unfounded fears and imagined consequences associated with the idea of purposely inserting a disease into one's body. However, despite one's beliefs, vaccines are essential not only to a person's well-being, but to the health of those around them. Mandatory vaccinations do not cause autism; rather, they save lives while upholding values of popular protest, or that focus on sought changes in civil society rather than in politics or the "}
