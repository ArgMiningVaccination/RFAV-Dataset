About UMP Classic Uniform Medical Plan (UMP ) Classic is a self -insured Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) health plan. UMP is offered through the Washington State Health Care Authority's Public Employees Benefits Board (PEBB) Program. UMP is administered by Regence BlueShield and Washington State Rx Services (WSRxS). All prescription drugs, services, or other benefit changes may require approval by th e PEB Board. Approval takes place when benefits are procured for the next cale ndar year. This plan is available only to people eligible for coverage through the PEBB Program, including employees and retirees of state government and institutions of higher education; retirees from school districts, educational service districts (ESDs ), and charter schools; and employees and retirees of certain local governments that participate in the PEBB Program, as well as their eligible dependents.2023 UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificat e of Coverage 15This plan is designed to keep you and your enrolled dependents healthy and provide benefits in case of injury or illness. Review this certificate of coverage (COC) carefully so you may get the most from your health care benefits. Accumulators Insurance accumulators may transfer when a subscriber changes their enrollment from one UMP plan to another UMP plan mid -year during a special open enrollment (SOE). When a subscriber enrolled in a PEBB Program UMP plan changes their own enrollment to ano ther PEBB Program UMP plan (meaning the subscriber continues to be the subscriber on the new PEBB Program UMP Plan) during an SOE, the amounts already accrued toward medical and pharmacy deductibles, out - of-pocket limits, and benefit limits (see definition of \"Limited benefit\") will transfer to the new PEBB Program UMP plan. These accumulators will also transfer for any member on the subscriber's account who changes UMP plans with the subscriber. When a subscriber enrolled in a SEBB Program UMP plan chang es their enrollment to a PEBB Program UMP plan (meaning the subscriber continues to be the subscriber on the new PEBB Program UMP Plan) during an SOE, the amounts already accrued toward the medical and pharmacy deductibles and the out - of-pocket limits for themselves and their enrolled dependents will transfer to the new PEBB Program UMP plan. These accumulators will also transfer for any member on the subscriber's account who changes UMP plans with the subscriber. If you have questions, call UMP Customer Service.

Primary care providers A primary care provider (PCP) is a physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant who provides, coordinates, and helps you access a range of health care services, such as covered immunizations. A P CP may also help coordinate care for you when you need to see specialists. You are not required to choose a PCP. However, a PCP may help prevent and treat health care conditions early, promoting your health and well -being. Patients who have a PCP have bet ter health outcomes and a 2023 UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificat e of Coverage 19better care experience. To be designated as a PCP, a provider must be one of the provider types and practice under one of the specialties listed below. Provider type: Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) Medical Doctor (M.D.) Naturopathic Physician (N.D.) Nurse Practitioner (A.R.N.P.) Physician Assistant (P.A. ) Specialties: Adult Medicine Family Practice General Practice Geriatrics Internal Medicine Obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) Pediatrics (for members under age 18) Preventive Medicine When you do not have access to a preferred provider: network waiver An appro ved network waiver allows the plan to pay for covered services provided by an out -of-network provider at the network rate. You may request a network waiver only when you do not have access to a preferred provider able to provide covered medically necessary services within 30 miles of your residence. A service or supply prescribed, ordered, recommended, approved, or given by a provider does not make it a medically necessary covered service or supply . When and how to request a network waiver Before your visit When services require preauthorization, you may request a network waiver before services are provided . Visit the UMP Policies that affect your care webpage for the list of services requiring preauthorization (see Directory for link ). Your network waiver request should be included with the preauthorization request. See the \"Information needed to subm it a network waiver request\" section below to learn what to include in your request. When the plan approves the network waiver before you receive medical services from an out -of-network provider: You pay your cost -share for medical services the plan has ap proved through this waiver as though the provider is preferred. You pay $0 for covered preventive services, including covered immunizations. The plan pays 100 percent of the allowed amount. After your visit When you receive any service, except those that require preauthorization, you may request a network waiver after the claims have been processed. Network waiver requests not approved in advance are considered an appeal and must be submitted within 180 days of receiving an Explanation of Benefits. See the \"Complaint and appeal procedures\" section for information about your appeal rights. Information needed to submit a network waiver request You should include all the following information in your request:20 2023UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificate of Coverage A letter of explanation from you or your provider stating the need to see the out -of-network provider. Details of the research conducted by you or your provider to locate a preferred provider (e.g., dates network status was checked, names and phone numbers o f preferred providers that were researched and may have been contacted before receiving services from the out -of-network provider). More information needed for preauthorization requests When submitting a request for preauthorization that includes a network waiver, all the following additional information should also be included: Performing provider's name, address, phone number, and National Provider Identifier (NPI) or Tax ID number (TIN) Diagnosis codes Procedure codes Length of treatment req uested or required for services Estimated charges See the \"Preauthorizing medical services\" section for more information about requesting medical services preauthorization from the plan. Where to send your network waiver request UMP Member Appeals Regence BlueShield PO Box 91015 Seattle, WA 98111 -9115 If you have questions about the network waiver process, call UMP Customer Service. ALERT! If a network waiver is approved, you must still pay your cost -share for most medical services. Services provided under an approved network waiver apply to your medical deductible and out -of-pocket limit. Network waivers for ongoing services may require periodic review. Out-of-area services Any area outside of Washington State is considered outside of the Regence BlueShield service area, as defined on page 199. Regence BlueShield has a variety of relationships with other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensees referred to generally as \"BlueCard\u00ae Programs.\" Whenever you obtain health care services ou tside of Regence's service area, the claims for these services may be processed through one of these BlueCard\u00ae Programs, and may include negotiated National Account arrangements available between Regence and other Blue Cross and Blue Shield Licensees. Typically, when accessing care outside of Regence's service area, you will obtain care from health care providers that have a contractual agreement with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensee in that other geographic area (as Host Blue). In some inst ances, you may obtain care from out -of-network providers. Regence's payment practices in both instances are described on page 21. BlueCard\u00ae Program Under the BlueCard\u00ae Program, when you access covered services within the geographic area served by a Host Blue, Regence will remain responsible for fulfilling contractual obligations. However, the Host Blue is responsible for contracting with and generally handling all interactions with its network providers.2023 UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificat e of Coverage 21Whenever you access covered services outside Regence's service area and the claim is processed through the BlueCard\u00ae Program, the amount you pay for covered services is calculated based on the lower of: The bill ed covered charges for your covered services; or The negotiated price that the Host Blue makes available to Regence. Often, this \"negotiated price\" will be a simple discount that reflects an actual price that the Host Blue pays to your health care provider . Sometimes, it is an estimated price that considers special arrangements with your health care provider or provider group that may include types of settlements, incentive payments, and/or other credits or charges. Occasionally, it may be an average price, based on a discount that results in expected average savings for similar types of health care providers after considering the same types of transactions as with an estimated price. Laws in a small number of states may require the Host Blue to add a surcha rge to your calculation. If any state laws mandate other liability calculation methods, including a surcharge, Regence would then calculate your liability for any covered services according to applicable law. Inter -Plan Programs: Federal or state taxes, su rcharges, or fees Federal law or state law may require a surcharge, tax or other fee that applies to self -insured accounts. If applicable, any such surcharge, tax or other fee will be included as part of the claim fee passed on to the claimant. Negotiated National Account arrangements As an alternative to the BlueCard\u00ae Program, your claims for covered services may be processed through a negotiated National Account arrangement with a Host Blue. The amount you pay for covered services under this arrangement w ill be calculated based on the lower of either billed covered charges or a negotiated price (refer to the description of negotiated price above) made available to Regence by the Host Blue. Out-of-network providers outside Regence's service area Member liability When covered services are provided outside of Regence's service area by out -of-network providers, the amount you pay for such services will generally be based on either the Host Blue's out -of-network provider local payment or the pricing arrangements required by applicable state law. In these situations, you may be liable for the difference between the amount that the out -of-network provider bills and the payment Regence will make for the covered services as set forth in this paragraph. Exceptions In certain situations, Regence may use other payment bases such as billed covered charges, the payment Regence would make if the health care services had been obtained within Regence's service area, or a special negotiated payment, as permitted under Inter -Plan Programs Policies, to determine the amount Regence will pay for services rendered by out -of-network providers. In these situations, you may be liable for the difference between the amount that the out -of-network provider bills and the payment Regence will make for the covered services as set forth in this paragraph.22 2023UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificate of CoverageServices received outside the United States ALERT! The plan does not cover prescription drugs ordered through mail -order pharmacies located outside the U.S. See \"Prescription drugs purchased outside the U.S.\" on page 101 to learn more. Blue Cross Blue Shield Global\u00ae Core If you are outside the U.S., you may be able to take advantage of Blue Cross Blue S hield Global\u00ae Core when accessing covered health services. Blue Cross Blue Shield Global\u00ae Core is unlike the BlueCard\u00ae Program available in the U.S. in certain ways. For instance, although the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global\u00ae Core assists you with accessing a network of inpatient, outpatient, and professional providers, the network is not served by a Host Blue. As such, when you receive care from providers outside the U.S., you will typically have to pay the providers and submit the claims yourself to obtain reimbursement for these services. If you need medical services (including locating a doctor or hospital) outside the U.S., you should call the service center at 1 -800-810-BLUE (2583) or call collect at 1 -804-673-1177, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. An assi stance coordinator, working with a medical professional, will arrange a physician appointment or hospitalization, if necessary. Inpatient services In most cases, if you contact the service center for assistance, hospitals will not require you to pay upfron t for covered inpatient services, except for your applicable deductible, and copays. In such cases, the hospital will submit your claims to the service center to begin claims processing. However, if you paid in full at the time of services, you must submit a claim to receive reimbursement for covered health care services. Outpatient services Physicians, urgent care centers, and other outpatient providers located outside the U.S. will typically require you to pay in full at the time of services. You must sub mit a claim to obtain reimbursement for covered health care services. Submitting a Blue Cross Blue Shield Global\u00ae Core claim When you pay for covered health care services outside the BlueCard\u00ae service area, you must submit a claim to obtain reimbursement. For institutional and professional claims, complete a Blue Cross Blue Shield Global\u00ae Core claim form and send the claim form with the provider's itemized bill(s) to the service center (the address is on the form) to initiate claims processing. Following th e instructions on the claim form will help ensure timely processing of your claim. The claim form is available from the claims administrator, the service center, or online at the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Co re\u00ae website at bcbsglobalcore.com . If you need assistance with your claim submission, you should call the service center at 1-800-810-BLUE (2583) or call collect at 1 -804-673-1177, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

What you pay for medical services Deductibles A deductible is a fixed dollar amount you pay each calendar year before the plan begins paying for covered services. The medical deductible amount is $250 per member, with a maximum of $750 per family. When you first get services, you pay the first $250 in charges. After you pay that first $250 , the plan begins to pay for covered services. This applies to each covered me mber, up to the $750 maximum. The medical deductible applies to all services unless otherwise stated in this COC. See below for services that are exempt from the medical deductible. Services apply to the UMP medical deductible in the order claims are received, not necessarily in the order the member receives the services. Note: You also pay a separate deductible for prescription drugs. See the \"What you pay for prescription drug s\" section for more information .24 2023UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificate of CoverageALERT! If you receive services with a bene fit limit (such as physical therapy) before meeting your medical deductible, those visits still apply to the benefit limit. For example, if you pay out of pocket for a physical therapy visit because you have not met your medical deductible, that visit will apply to the maximum of 60 visits per calendar year. See definition of \"Limited benefit\" for more information. If you earned the SmartHealth wellness incentive Eligible subscribers can qualify for a $125 reduction in their 202 3 PEBB medical plan deductible. If you qualified in 202 2 and you are still eligible to participate in the wellness incentive program , your medical plan deductible will be reduced in January 202 3. More details on eligibility and program requirements are on HCA's SmartHealth webpage at hca.wa.gov/pebb -smarthealth . What does not count toward your medical deductible The following out -of-pocket expenses do not count to ward your $250 medical deductible: Charges for service visits over benefit limits. For example, the annual benefit limit for physical therapy is 60 visits. Costs for more than 60 visits are not covered by the plan, and do not count toward your medical deductible. Charges for services over benefit maximums. Charges over this amount do not apply to your medical deductible. Out-of-network provider charges above the allowed amount (see the \" Sample payments to different provider types \" section ). Prescription drug costs (see the \"What you pay for prescription drug s\" section for more information ). Services that are exempt from the medical deductible, even if you had out -of-pocket costs . For example, covered preventive care received from an out -of-netwo rk provider. Services you pay for that are not covered by the plan (see the \"What the plan does not cover\" section ). Your emergency room copay. Your inpatient hospital copay. Your chiropractor copay. Your acupuncture copay. Your massage therapy copay. Services exempt from the medical deductible The plan pays the allowed amount for the services listed below , subject to cost -share, even if you have not met your medical deductible. When you see a preferred or participating provider, you do not have to meet you r medical deductible before the plan pays for these services: Covered contraceptive supplies and services (see the \"Family planning services\" benefit ). Covered preventive care, including covered immunizations. Diabetes Control Program. Diabetes Prevention Program. Prescription drugs covered under the prescription drug benefit .2023 UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificat e of Coverage 25 Routine hearing exams. Hearing aids (you pay $0 and the plan pays 100 percent). Routine vision care: exams, glasses, and contacts. Second opinions require d by the plan. Tobacco cessa tion services. Note: See page 93 for prescription drug deductible exemptions. How the medical deductible works with dependents If your family has three or fewer members enrolled, the medical deductible amount i s $250 per member, with a maximum of $750. Once a member pays their $250 deductible, the plan begins paying for covered services for that member. Because the plan is now paying for this member's covered serv ices, they are no longer contributing toward the family deductible. Once the family deductible has been met, the plan begins paying for all covered services. If your family has four or more members enrolled, each member has a medical deductible of $250 and the maximum the family pays toward medical deductibles is $750. Once a member pays their $250 deductible, the plan begins paying for covered services for that member. Because the plan is now paying for this member's covered services, they are no longer co ntributing toward the family deductible. Once the family deductible has been met, the plan begins paying for all covered services for all enrolled family members, even if some have not met their own deductible. If the subscriber earned the SmartHealth wel lness incentive for the 202 3 plan year, the subscriber's medical deductible is reduced. See the \"If you earned the SmartHealth wellness incentive\" section above to learn more . Note: Only services that are covered and are subject to the medical deductible c ount toward the deductible. See page 24 for a list of services that do not count toward the medical deductible. Coinsurance TIP: Allowed amount is the most the plan pays for a specific covered service or supply. Out -of- network providers may charge more than this amount, and you are responsible for paying the difference between the billed amount and the allowed amount. This is called balance billing. Coinsurance is th e percentage of the allowed amount you pay for most medical services and for prescription drugs when the plan pays less than 100 percent. After you meet your medical deductible, you pay the percentages described below for most covered medical services. See the following sections for more information on how much you pay for prescription drugs : \"What you pay for prescription drugs,\" \"How the prescription drug cost -limit works,\" \"Your prescription drug out -of-pocket limit .\" For preferred providers: You pay 15 percent of the allowed amount . The plan pays 85 percent of the allowed amount. For participating providers: You pay 40 percent of the allowed amount . The plan pays mo st covered services at 60 percent of the allowed amount. For out -of-network providers: You pay 40 percent of the allowed amount, and the provider may balance bill you . The plan pays most covered services at 60 percent of the allowed amount. 26 2023UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificate of CoverageProfessional charges, such as for physician services while you are in the hospital or lab work, may b e billed separately. Note: When you receive nonemergency services at a network hospital, network hospital outpatient department, network critical access hospital, or network ambulatory surgical center in Washington State, you pay the network rate and canno t be balance billed regardless of the network status of the provider. For nonemergency services performed at one of these facilities outside of Washington State, you still pay the network rate, but in some states, an out -of-network provider may be allowed to ask you to waive some of your balance billing protections. At an out -of-network facility, when you receive emergency services you pay the network cost -sharing amount regardless of the network status of the provider or facility and cannot be balance bill ed. Copay A copay is a set dollar amount you pay when you receive services, treatments, or supplies, including, but not limited to: Emergency room copay: $75 per visit. See the \"Emergency room\" benefit for details. Facility charges for services received wh ile an inpatient at a hospital, or mental health, skilled nursing, or substance use disorder facility: $200 per day (see \"Inpatient copay\" below). Covered chiropractic, acupuncture , and massage services when you see a preferred provider will have a $15 cop ay per visit. The copay for these services will apply toward the annual out -of-pocket maximums. See the \"Spinal and extremity manipulations\" benefit, \"Massage therapy\" for more details. Inpatient copay FOR MEDICARE RETIRE ES: The maximum inpatient copay is $600 per facility admission up to your medical out -of-pocket limit. The inpatient copay of $200 per day is what you pay for inpatient services at a preferred facility, such as a hospital, or mental health, skilled nursing , or substance use disorder facility. You and your enrolled dependents pay up to $600 maximum per enrolled member per calendar year. The inpatient copay does not apply to your medical deductible but does apply to your medical out -of- pocket limit. Note: Professional charges, such as lab work or provider services, while you are in the hospital may be billed separately and are not included in this copay. When you pay Most of the time, you pay after your claim is processed. You will receive an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) from the plan that explains how much the plan paid the provider.

When this happens, check your EOB to make sure the amount you paid is accurately reflected in the Member Responsibility section. Call UMP Customer Service with questions. Medical out -of-pocket limit ALERT! Prescription drug costs do not apply to your medical out -of-pocket limit (see below ). The medical out -of-pocket limit is the most you pay during a calendar year for covered services from preferred providers. After you meet your medical out -of-pocket limit for the year, the plan pays for covered services by preferred providers at 100 percent of the allowed amount. The plan will not pay more than the allowed amount. Expenses are counted from January 1, 202 3, or your first day of enrollment (whichever is later) through December 31, 202 3, or your last day of enrollment (whichever is earlier).

FOR MEDICARE RETIREES: See the \"For retirees enrolled in Medicare and UMP Classic\" section. UMP Classic is a self -insured PPO health plan. UMP is offered through the Washington State Health Care Authority's Public Employees Benefits Board (PEBB) Program. UMP is administered by Regence BlueShield, and Washington State Rx Services (WSRxS). All prescription dru gs, services, or other benefit changes may require approval by the PEB Board. Approval takes place when benefits are procured for the next calendar year. For example, prescription drugs newly approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may requ ire approval by the PEB Board before the plan will cover them.34 2023UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificate of CoverageHealth Technology Clinical Committee (HTCC) ALERT! HTCC determinations may be implemented by the plan at any time during the calendar year, but are often implemented the January following the H TCC's decision. HTCC decisions are posted on the HCA website at hca.wa.gov/hta . Contact UMP C ustomer Service if you have questions about specific services that the HTCC has reviewed. Created by chapter 70.14 of the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) , the HTCC is a committee of 11 independent health care professionals that reviews selected health te chnologies (services) to determine appropriate coverage, if any, for the services. These may include medical or surgical devices and procedures, medical equipment, and diagnostic tests. In public meetings, the HTCC considers public comments and scientific evidence regarding the safety, medical effectiveness, and cost -effectiveness of the services when making its determination. How HTCC decisions affect UMP benefits Under state law, the plan must comply with HTCC decisions , RCW 70.14.120 (1)(a), unless suc h determination conflicts with federal or state law . Services reviewed by the HTCC are either covered, covered with conditions, or not covered. The HTCC determines the conditions, if any, under which the service will be included as a covered benefit and, if covered, the criteria the plan must use to decide whether the service is medically necessary. Criteria established by the HTCC take precedence over Regence's medical policies. When the HTCC determines that a service is not covered, then the service is not covered by the plan . Some HTCC decisions include a requirement to follow FDA or Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines. You may review these guidelines on the FDA website at fda.gov or CMS website at cms.gov . Where to find HTCC decisions You may view the list of services that the HTCC has reviewed or currently has under review on the HCA website at hca.wa.gov/hta . The website includes: Evidence reports Instructions on providing public comments on pending reviews or re -reviews Public comments The decisions and criteria for coverage The public meeting schedule You may also call UMP Customer Service with questions about coverage of conditions for HTCC technologies.

Products covered under the preventive care benefit ALERT! For products covered as preventive \u2014 even if normally available over the counter without a prescription \u2014 you must have a prescription and buy it at the pharmacy counter in a network pharmacy to receive 100 percent reimbursement. You may not receive full reimbursement for claims from non -pharmacy register receipts and non -network pharmacies. Prescriptions purchased from an excluded pharmacy will not be covered. See the definition of \"Excluded pharmacy.\" Some products are covered under the preventive care benefit if they: Are recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (see the \"Preventive care\" benefit ); and 2023 UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificat e of Coverage 91 Conform to coverage guidelines (see the \"How UMP dec ides which prescription drugs are preferred\" section ). The brands and types of products covered are limited. Call WSRxS Customer Service for more information on which ones are covered. You pay $0 if your provider writes you a prescription and you purchase these products from the pharmacy counter at a network pharmacy. If you purchase over the counter and send in a paper claim, you may pay part of the cost. Contraceptive drugs and supplies are covered as preventive (see the \"Family planning services\" benefit for details). See the \"Tobacco cessation services\" benefit for products covered as preventive for tobacco cessation. Some injectable drugs are covered only under the prescription drug benefit Certain prescription drug categories are covered only under the prescription drug benefit and not the medical benefit. Your pharmacy may submit a claim for these prescription drug classes to WSRxS. Compounded prescription drugs Compounded prescription drugs are the result of combining, mixing, or altering ingredients by a pharmacist in response to a physician's prescription to create a new drug tailored to the specialized medical needs of an individual member. Traditional compounding typically occurs when an FDA -approved prescription drug is unavailable, or a licensed health care provider decides that an FDA -approved drug is not appropriate for a member's medical needs. Compounded prescription drugs are covered under Tier 2 and require preauthorization. Claims for compounded drugs require additional information submitte d on the claim form. This information is available from the compounding pharmacy. What you pay for prescription drugs The amount you pay for your prescription drugs depends on the prescription drug's tier , where you purchase your prescriptions , whether you have met your annual out -of-pocket limit, an d for some drugs, whether you have met your deductible .

To check your cost, use the Drug Price Check tool on the UMP Prescription drug coverage webpage (the prices for drugs listed in this tool assume you have met your prescription drug deductible). Using Value Tier and Tier 1 drugs reduces prescription costs for both you and the p lan. Generic drugs, follow -on biologics, and biosimilars have the same active ingredient as their brand -name counterparts and are usually less expensive.2023 UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificat e of Coverage 93Note: You must use UMP's network mail -order pharmacies to fill mail -order prescriptions. If you use any other mail -order service to fill your prescription drugs, or you purchase them outside of the U.S., the plan will not cover these drugs if UMP is your primary plan . ALERT! When you use network pharmacies, retail or mail -order, you pay based on the prescription drug's allowed amount, a discounted price negotiated by the plan. If you use a non-network pharmacy , the pharmacy may charge more than the plan's allowed amount. You will have to pay th is additional a mount, which does not apply to your prescription drug deductible or out -of-pocket limit. Prescriptions purchased from an excluded pharmacy will not be covered. See the definition of \"Excluded pharmacy.\" Prescription drug deductible The prescription drug de ductible is $100 per member, with a maximum of $300 for a family of three or more members covered under the same account. You pay this deductible to the pharmacy when you purchase a Tier 2 prescription drug (except for covered insulins) . TIP: Since you do not pay any deductible for Preventive, Value Tier, Tier 1 drugs or covered insulins , if you only get drugs from these tiers during the year, you will not need to meet the prescription drug deductible. How the deductible works Note: The medical deductible and prescription drug deductible are separate. You pay the prescription drug deductible for Tier 2 drugs. Until you meet your prescription drug deductible, you pay the deductible plus any applicable coinsurance, up to the cost of the drug. For prescription drugs that cost less than your deductible , you pay the cost of the drug until you meet th e prescription drug deductible. Note: If UMP pays second, you must still meet your prescription drug deductible before UMP covers Tier 2 drugs except for covered insulins (see \"How COB works with prescription drugs\" on page 126). What applies to your deductible The following paid by the member directly or paid on behalf of the member by another person including payments made through a manufacturer drug coupon or other manufacturer discount: Amounts paid toward covered Tier 2 prescription drugs. Amounts paid toward supplies designated as Tier 2 and covered under the prescription drug benefit.

Where you pay the deductible You pay the prescription drug deductible at any pharmacy. The prescription drug deductible must be met before the plan begins paying benefits for Tier 2 drugs except for covered insulins . Network pharmacies will know if you've met your prescription drug deductible, or if it does not apply to your prescription. This means that you pay only the amount remaining after the plan pays. If you use a non -network pharmacy (see page 100) you must pay the billed charges for the drug and submit a paper claim for reimburse ment of the covered amount . Prescriptions purchased from an excluded pharmacy will not be covered. See the definition of \"Excluded pharmacy.\" Your coinsurance for prescription drugs ALERT! See page 54 for special prescription drug coverage while in hospice care. You pay coinsurance for most covered prescription drugs, which is a percentage of the drug's cost. You may purchase up to a 90 -day supply for most prescription drugs . For the majority of specialty drugs , you may purchase up to a 30 -day supply . 1 Non-network pharmacies may charge more than the allowed amount for prescription drugs. You are responsible for paying this amount in addition to your coinsurance. Prescriptions purchased from an excluded pharmacy will not be covered.

For each member enrolled in the plan, the prescription drug out -of-pocket limit is $2,000 per member, with a family limit of $4,000. Each member must meet their own prescription drug out -of-pocket limit separately until the family limit is reached . After you reach this limit, the plan pays 100 percent of the allowed amount for covered prescription drugs and products.

The UMP Preferred Drug List may not show every alternative prescription drug you must try before an exception may be granted. If your exception request is denied, the plan's response letter will include the reason for the denial and the steps you can take nex t. Excluded prescription drugs and products are not eligible for an exception . However, non -covered prescription drugs are eligible for an exception . If you are prescribed a noncovered drug, and you have tried all the alternative drugs and none are found to be effective, or if the alternatives are found to not be medically appropriate, you or your prescribing provider can request an exception by calling WSRxS Customer Service. Your prescribing provider can also use CoverMyMeds to request an exception. Cove rMyMeds is a free online platform that reviews exception requests from electronic health record systems or directly through the CoverMyMeds portal. To get started, have your provider visit the CoverMyMeds website (see Directory for link ). Your prescribing provider must submit clinical information to request an exception. When the plan approves an exception based on the criteria below, you will pay the Tier 2 cost -share. See \"What you pay for prescription drugs .\" If your exception request is denied, the plan's response letter will include the reason for the denial and the steps you can take next. Preferred drug list exceptions and coverage determinations are based on medical necessity. Because requesting a noncovered drug exception requires medical information, only your prescribing provider may submit clinical information for review . The prescribi ng provider will need to provide WSRxS with the following information: The prescribing provider's contact information; An explanation of why the plan should grant an exception; An explanation of how the requested medication therapy is evidence -based and g enerally accepted medical practice; Documentation of medical necessity for the requested prescription drug over all other preferred therapeutic alternatives (Value Tier, Tier 1, and Tier 2); and At least one of the following items must also be included wit h the exception request: Confirmation and documentation from your prescribing provider that all preferred therapeutic alternatives (Value Tier, Tier 1, and Tier 2) were tried for a clinically appropriate duration of treatment and failed to produce a therap eutic response. If the requested exception is for a brand -name prescription drug that has an FDA -approved generic equivalent, your prescribing provider must document your inadequate response to at least two manufacturers of the generic drug, or to all manu facturers of the generic drug if there are fewer than two manufacturers, in addition to all other preferred therapeutic alternatives, before an exception is granted; or Confirmation and documentation from your prescribing provider that all preferred therap eutic alternatives (Value Tier, Tier 1, and Tier 2), including the required number of manufacturers of the same generic prescription drug, caused an adverse drug reaction that prevents you from taking the prescription drug as directed. If the requested exc eption is for a brand -name prescription drug that has an FDA -approved generic equivalent, your prescribing provider must document your adverse 98 2023UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificate of Coveragedrug reaction to at least two manufacturers of the generic drug, or to all manufacturers of the generic drug if t here are fewer than two manufacturers, in addition to all other preferred therapeutic alternatives, before an exception is granted. ALERT! The exception process for noncovered drugs cannot be used for drugs that UMP excludes. For more information about dru gs UMP excludes , see the \"Prescription drugs and products UMP does not cover\" and the \" What the plan does not cover\" section s. If you have other prescription drug coverage If you have primary medical coverage through another plan that covers prescription drugs, some of the limits and restrictions to prescription drug coverage listed on page 126 will apply when UMP pays secondary to another plan. See the \"Submitting a claim for prescription drugs\" section for how to submit your prescription drug claim. Using network pharmacies when UMP is secondary If you have primary coverage through another plan that covers prescription drugs, show both plan cards to the pharmacy and make sure they know which plan is primary. It is important that the pharmacy bills the plans in the correct order, or claims may be denied or paid incorrectly. Using mail -order pharmacies when UMP is secondary FOR MEDICARE RETIREES: When Medi care is your primary coverage, UMP's network mail - order pharmac ies cannot bill Medicare for prescription drugs that are also covered by Medicare Part B . You must submit a claim to Regence after Medicare has paid its share. See the \"Submitting a claim for medical services \" section. If your primary plan uses UMP's network mail -order pharmac ies, these pharmacies may process payments for both plans and charge you only what is left. Make sure that UMP's network mail -order pharmacies have your information for bot h plans and know which plan is primary. However, if your primary plan uses a different mail -order pharmacy, you will have to use your primary plan's mail -order pharmacy, then submit a paper claim for payment by UMP. See the \"Submitting a claim for prescrip tion drugs\" section for how to do this. Where to buy your prescription drugs ALERT! If you use a non -network retail pharmacy, you will pay the entire cost of the prescription drug at the time of purchase and must submit a claim for reimbursement. However, only the allowed amount for covered drugs will apply to your prescription drug deductible or prescription drug out -of-pocket limit. Prescriptions purchased from an excluded pharmacy will not be covered. See the definition of \"Excluded pharmacy.\" Pharmacies are contracted through a different network than medical providers. The below sections explain how to confirm a pharmacy is in the plan's network.2023 UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificat e of Coverage 99Retail pharmacies FOR MEDICARE RETIREES: See the \" How UMP Classic prescription drug coverage works with Medicare \" section for more information on how UMP prescription drug coverage works with Medicare. WSRxS has a large national network of retail pharmacies, which includes many independent and regional pharmacies in Washington State, as well as national chai ns. Search for a network pharmacy on the UMP Prescription drug coverage webpage or call WSRxS Customer Service (see Directory for link and contact information) . When you get your prescriptions at a network pharmacy, the pharmacy sends the claim to the plan for you, and you pay only your cost -share (coinsurance and prescription drug deductible) as described in the \"What you pay for prescription drugs\" section . Covered insulin prescr iptions filled at network pharmacies are not subject to the prescription drug deductible. Note: You will pay the entire cost for any prescription drug not covered by the plan, which does not apply to your prescription drug deductible or your prescription d rug out -of-pocket limit. TIP: If you take a prescription drug regularly, you may be able to save money by filling up to a 90-day supply at a network retail pharmacy or through UMP's network mail -order pharmac ies. Search for a network pharmacy and compare prices on the UMP Prescription drug coverage webpage . Network v accination pharmac ies Many network retail pharmacies have vaccination pharmacists who may give covered preventive immunizations at no cost to you . Call a network pharmacy ahead of time to make sure the pharmacy has the vaccine you need. Present your UMP member ID card at the pharmacy counter before receiving a vaccine. Mail-order pharmac ies: Costco Mail-Order Pharmacy and Postal Prescription Service s (PPS) ALERT! UMP's network mail -order pharmacies cannot ship outside of the U.S. See \"Travel overrides for prescription drugs\" on page 106 if you will be traveling .

The plan does not cover other mail-order pharmacies outside of UMP's network mail - order pharmacies if UMP is your primary insurance. If UMP is your secondary insurance, you may us e another mail-order pharmacy. Refills may be ordered through UMP's network mail -order pharmacies. When using UMP's network mail - order pharmacies , the same prescription drug deductible, coinsurance, preauthorization requirements, and limits on coverage app ly as for prescription drugs purchased at retail network pharmacies. ALERT! Drugs can be expensive. If you are not able to be home to receive the drug in the mail, it may be a good idea to request that it be sent with a requirement for a signature, or fin d an alternate point of delivery to ensure the package is not stolen. The plan is not responsible for replacement of lost, stolen, expired, or damaged prescription drugs or products (see the \"What the plan does not cover\" section ). Prescriptions mailed, or orders placed in December but not filled until January 1 or after, are subject to the prescription drug deductible applicable on the date the prescription is processed. Because of increased volume at the end of the year, prescriptions submitted to the net work mail -order pharmacies in December may not be processed during the current benefit year. If there is a shortage of a specific prescription drug that UMP's network mail -order pharmacies cannot control, and it does not have the quantity you ordered, the network mail -order pharmacies will contact you to discuss your options for obtaining your prescription(s). ALERT! Some Durable Medical Equipment (DME ) items are not available through UMP's network mail -order pharmacies . You will need to get them through a network retail pharmacy or preferred DME provider. How to get the plan discount You pay for prescription drugs based on the allowed amount (WSRxS' standard reimbursement). If you use a non -network pharmacy or do not show your UMP member ID card a t a network pharmacy, and the amount charged is more than the UMP discounted allowed amount, you will pay the difference in addition to your coinsurance. If UMP is your primary insurance coverage, always show your UMP member ID card at the pharmacy to make sure you pay the right amount for your prescription. If UMP is your secondary insurance coverage, show both plan member ID cards at the pharmacy and make sure they know which plan pays first so the pharmacy may bill the plans in the correct order. Non-network pharmacies: Retail You will save money when you buy your prescriptions at network retail pharmacies and network mail - order pharmacies . You may buy your prescriptions (excep t specialty drugs) at a non -network retail pharmacy, but you will pay more if you do. If you get your prescriptions filled at a non -network retail pharmacy, the following applies: You need to submit your claim to WSRxS for reimbursement (see the \"Submitting a claim for prescription drugs\" section ).2023 UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificat e of Coverage 101 You do not get the plan discount. You will pay the difference between the allowed amount and what the pharmacy charges, and it will not apply to your prescription drug deductible or prescription drug out -of-pocket limit. Claims for covered insulin s must be submitted to WSRxS for reimbursem ent before they can apply to your prescription drug deductible. The plan pays the allowed amount for prescription drugs covered by the plan, whether from a network or non -network retail pharmacy, under the coinsurance percentages as shown in the \"What you pay for prescription drugs \" section. The prescription cost -limit (see the \"What you pay for prescription drugs\" section ) does not apply. Non-network pharmacies will not know if a prescription drug must be preauthorized, has a quantity limit, or has other coverage limits. If you purchase a drug from a non -network pharmacy and limits apply, the plan may not cover or reimburse it. Prescriptions purchased from an excluded pharmacy will not be covered. See the definition of \"Excluded pharmacy.\" Specialty drugs must be purchased from the plan's network specialty drug pharmacy . See the \"Specialty drug\" section on page 104. TIP: To submit claims for prescriptions purchased from non -network pharmacies (U.S. retail or international retail pharmacies), see the \"Submitting a claim for prescription drugs\" section. Prescription drugs purchased outside the U.S. If you purchase prescript ion drugs outside the U.S. for any reason, the following rules apply: If the prescription drug is available only by prescription in the U.S. but does not require one outside the U.S., the drug is covered only if prescribed by a provider practicing within t heir scope of practice. If you get a prescription drug that is approved for use in another country but not in the U.S., the plan will not cover it. If you get a prescription drug that is available over the counter in the U.S., the plan will not cover the drug, even if you have a prescription from a provider prescribing within their scope of practice. The plan does not cover most over-the-counter drugs . If you get a prescription drug that is not covered by UMP , the plan will not pay any amount of the cost of the drug. You will be responsible for the full cost of the drug. To submit a claim for a prescription drug purchased at retail pharmacies outside the U.S., see the \"Submitting a claim for prescription drugs\" section. All necessary information must be incl uded on the prescription drug claim form with drugs and dosage documented. Limits on your prescription drug coverage WSRxS may exclude, not cover, discontinue, or limit coverage for any prescription drug or manufacturer's version of a drug \u2014 or shift a dr ug to a different tier, or to noncovered or excluded status \u2014 for any of the following reasons: A more cost -effective alternative is available to treat the same condition. A nonprescription alternative, including an over -the-counter alternative, becomes av ailable.102 2023UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificate of Coverage A prescription drug receives FDA approval for a new use. A prescription drug is purchased from an excluded pharmacy . Generic, biosimilar, interchangeable biosimilar, or follow -on biologic prescription drugs become available. New prescription drugs are developed. The FDA denies, withdraws, or limits the approval of a prescription drug. The FDA's Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) classifications finds a prescription drug to be less than effective. The Washington State P&T Committee or WSRxS r ecommends a change (see the \"How UMP decides which prescription drugs are preferred\" section ). There is a sound medical reason. There is lack of scientific evidence that a prescription drug is as safe and effective as existing drugs used to treat the same or similar conditions. There is new scientific evidence demonstrating a prescription drug has been found to be less safe or effective than existing drugs to treat the same or similar conditions. Using free prescription drug samples does not guarantee cove rage or waive requirements for preauthorization, step therapy, quantity limits, day supply limits, or other limitations. Prescription drugs will only be covered if they are not excluded by the plan, are a covered prescription drug on the UMP Preferred Drug List, and are medically necessary for your health condition . Your provider may prescribe a prescription drug or drug dose that is not medically necessary. The plan excludes experimental or investigati onal prescription drugs. You may be liable for all charges if you receive prescription drugs or products that are determined to be experimental or investigational (see the \"What the plan does not cover\" section ). If you disagree with the plan's determination, you have the right to an appeal (see the \"Complaint and appeal procedures\" section for that process). The limits and restrictions described in the \"Limits on your prescription drug coverage\" section help WSRxS monitor drug usage, safety, and costs. These limits and restrictions may be added or removed from prescription drugs at any time. You may find out if your prescription drug falls under any of these limits and restrictions by checking the UMP Preferred Drug List on the UMP Prescription drug coverage webpage or calling WSRxS Customer Service (see Directory for link and contact information ). Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) is a drug safety program that the FDA can require for certain prescription drugs with serious safety concerns to help make sure the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. REMS are designed to reinforce prescri ption drug use behaviors and actions that support the safe use of that drug. While all drugs have labeling that describe possible risks, only a few prescription drugs require a REMS. REMS are not designed to mitigate all the adverse events of a prescriptio n drug. These are communicated to health care providers in the drug's prescribing information. Rather, REMS focuses on preventing, monitoring, and/or managing a specific serious risk by informing, educating, and/or reinforcing actions to reduce the frequen cy and/or severity of the event. If the REMS program is not followed, the plan may not cover the restricted drug. Preauthorizing prescription drugs Preauthorization is a process that helps make sure that prescription drug benefits are administered as designed and that plan members receive a drug therapy that is safe and effective for their conditions, and 2023 UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificat e of Coverage 103provides the greatest value. Some prescription drugs require preauthorization to determine whether they are medically necessary and meet all applicable coverage criteria, or the plan will not cover them. You may find out if your prescription drug requires preauthorization by calling WSRxS Customer Service or checking the UMP Preferred Drug List on the UMP Prescription drug coverage webpage (see the Directory pages at the beginning of this booklet for links and contact information ). You and your prescribing provider may also find the coverage criteria for your prescription drug by referring to the Washington State Rx Services (Moda) preauthorization (UMP [PEBB ] Plans) preauthorization forms and publications at hca.wa.gov/ump -forms -pubs . If your prescription drug requires preauthorization, your pharmacist or prescribing provider may initiate a request through CoverMyMeds, a free online platform that accepts requests from electronic health records, or directly through the CoverMyMeds P ortal. To get started, your pharmacist or prescribing provider can go to the CoverMyMeds website . They may also call WSRxS Customer Service to request it. If you have an existing authorization from UMP for a brand -name drug, and a generic drug becomes available, you may need to renew your authorization to continue filling the brand -name drug. However, if you switch to the generic drug, a new preauthorization is not required until the existing authorization expires. Note: Prescription drugs covered under th e medical benefit rather than the prescription drug benefit have different rules for preauthorization. Call UMP Customer Service for details. Emergency fill Emergency fill lets you get a limited quantity of certain prescription drugs while the plan process es your preauthorization request. This option is only available when a delay could result in emergency care, hospital admission, or a serious threat to your health or others in contact with you. Call WSRxS Customer Service for questions about which prescri ptions drugs may qualify for emergency fills. You must bring your prescription to a network pharmacy and state that you need an emergency fill while the plan processes your preauthorization request. You pay your coinsurance under the prescription drug's tier. The plan will cover an emergency fill of up to a seven -day prescription drug supply. If your preauthorization request is denied, you will pay the full cost of the prescription drug for any quantity you receive after the emergency fill. Emergency fill limits The following limits still apply to emergency fill prescription drugs: Quantity limits: You cannot get more than the stated quantity limit under an emergency fill. If you have a current filled prescription for a prescription drug (or its therapeutic equivalent) and it was filled to the quantity limit, you cannot get an emergency fill until you have used 84 percent or more of the filled prescription. Refill too soon: If you have a filled prescription for a prescription drug (or its therapeutic equivalent), you cannot get an emergency fill until you have used 84 percent or more of the filled prescription. Quantity limits Certain prescription drugs have a per prescript ion limit on how much you get for each fill. If you need more than this limit allows, your pharmacist or prescribing provider may initiate a request through CoverMyMeds on the CoverMyMeds website or call WSRxS Customer Service . See the Directory pages at the beginning of this booklet for links and contact information. If WSRxS denies your request or your provider or pharmacist does not get preauthorization, the plan will cover the prescription drug only up to the quantity limit amount. You will pay for any extra amount.104 2023UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificate of CoverageSpecialty drugs ALERT! Specialty drugs can be expensive. If you are not able to be home to receive the drug in the mail, it may be a good idea to request that it be sent with a r equirement for a signature, or find an alternate point of delivery to ensure the package is not stolen. Specialty drugs are high -cost injectable, infused, oral, or inhaled prescription drugs or products that require special handling and storage and are su bject to additional rules. You may find out if a drug is a specialty drug by checking the UMP Preferred Drug List on the UMP Prescription drug coverage webpage , or by calling WSRxS Customer Service (see Directory for link and contact information ). Specialty drugs are covered under the cost -share tier listed on the UMP Preferred Drug List. Specialty drugs are covered only when purchased through the plan's network specialty drug pharmacy. If that pharmacy does not have access to a specialty drug, you will be notified to fill your prescription at another specialty drug pharmacy. If the network specialty drug pharmacy gains access to the specialty drug, you will receive notification to transfer your prescription to that pharmacy . You may receive up to a 30 -day supply for most specialty prescription drugs per prescription or refill. However, some may be limited to a 15 -day supply due to high discontinuation ra te, short duration of use, or to make sure that the prescription drug is not causing harmful side effects. Specialty drugs require preauthorization. See \"Preauthorizing prescription drugs\" on page 102 for how to request preauthorization. A patient care coordinator will work with you to schedule a delivery time for the prescription drug. The specialty drug pharmacy will deliver your prescription drugs anywhere in the U.S. that you choose, such as to your workplace or to a neighbor if you cannot be home for the delivery. Specialty prescription drugs often require special handling and storage. The plan is not responsible for replacement of lost, stolen, expired, or dama ged prescription drugs or products (see the \"What the plan does not cover\" section ). If your provider will be administering the prescription drug, you may have it shipped to the provider's office. However, once the provider's office receives the prescripti on drug, the provider takes responsibility for it. The plan's network specialty drug pharmacy cannot ship outside the U.S. See \"Travel overrides for prescription drugs\" on page 106 if you will be traveling. Prescription cost -limit for specialty drugs ALERT! The prescription cost -limit is the most you will pay for an individual prescription. However, you may pay less based on normal coinsurance (see the \"What you pay f or prescription drugs\" section ). See the \"How the prescription drug cost-limit works\" section for details about the prescription cost -limit. This limit applies to individual prescriptions only. See the \"Your prescription drug out -of-pocket limit\" section for the annual limit to your prescription drug costs. Specialty drugs are usually limited to no more than a 30 -day supply. The prescription cost -limit for a 30 - day (or under) supply corresponds to the \"You pay\" column in the table found in the \"How the prescription drug cost -limit works\" section .2023 UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificat e of Coverage 105However, some specialty prescription drugs are available only in packages with more than a 30 -day supply. In such cases, the prescription cost -limit shown in the table found in the \"How the prescription drug cost-limit works\" section is calculated by multiplying the standard 30 -day prescription cost -limit amount as follows: A 31- to 60 -day supply, multiply the standard prescription cost -limit by two. A 61-day and greater supply, multiply the standard prescript ion cost -limit by three. Example: If your specialty drug is Tier 2 and you receive a 45 -day supply, the most you will pay (prescription cost -limit) is $150 (standard 30 -day limit $75 x 2=$150). Step therapy ALERT! If a Step 1 or Step 2 drug is approved for coverage by WSRxS, you will pay the applicable cost -share of that prescription drug according to its tier in the UMP Preferred Drug List. When a prescription drug is part of the step therapy program, you have to try certain drugs (Step 1) before the plan will cover the prescribed (Step 2 ) drug. When a prescription for a step therapy drug is submitted \"out of order,\" meaning you have not first tried the Step 1 drug before submitting a prescription for a Step 2 drug, the plan will not cover your prescription . When this happens, your provider will need to prescribe the Step 1 drug for you. If you or your provider feels that you need the Step 2 prescription filled as originally written without first trying the Step 1 drug, your pharmacist or prescribing provide r may call WSRxS Customer Service and request coverage. You will have to pay the entire cost of the prescription drug if you have not tried the Step 1 drug and coverage has not been authorized before you get the Step 2 drug. To find out if step therapy app lies to your drug, check the UMP Preferred Drug List on the UMP Prescription drug coverage webpage , or call WSRxS Customer Service (see Directory for link and contact information ). Note: Only network pharmacies will check to see if step therapy applies to your prescription drug. If you get a step therapy drug at a non -network pharmacy, the plan may not cover the drug. Substitution under Washington State law ALERT! New generic prescription drugs are released throughout the year. If you want to save money by using generics, ask your provider to allow substitution on your prescriptions, even if a generic drug is not available now. That way, when one becomes available, the pharmacist may automatical ly refill with the generic. When a brand -name or biologic prescription drug has a generic equivalent or interchangeable biosimilar, pharmacists in Washington State must substitute the generic equivalent or interchangeable biosimilar drug for the brand -name or biologic prescription drug. When a generic equivalent for a brand -name prescription drug becomes available, the brand -name drug immediately becomes noncovered. Your provider may write the prescription \"dispense as written\" if they want you to get only the prescribed brand -name or biologic prescription drug. Or you may tell the pharmacist you want the brand -name or 106 2023UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificate of Coveragebiologic drug. Regardless of whether you or your prescribing provider ask the pharmacist to \"dispense as written,\" if you get the noncovered prescription drug, the plan may not cover it. Final determination of medical necessity for FDA -approved contraceptives is determined by the attending prescribing provider . To request an exception for a noncovered drug, see page 97. Therapeutic Interchange Program The Washington State Therapeutic Interchange Program allows a pharmacist to substitute a \"therapeutic alternative\" drug for a noncovered drug in certain ca ses. Therapeutic alternatives are drugs that are chemically different from your prescribed drug but provide the same therapeutic benefit. You may find out if your prescription drug is affected by the Therapeutic Interchange Program by checking the UMP Preferred Drug List on the UMP Prescription drug coverage webpage or by calling WSRxS Customer Service (see Direct ory for link and contact information ). The Therapeutic Interchange program does not affect all noncovered prescription drugs. The pharmacist will substitute the preferred drug when your prescribing provider has \"endorsed \" the Washington Preferred Drug List, and: You are filling your prescription in Washington State or through UMP's network mail -order pharmacies . Your prescribing provider allows substitution on your prescription. If you do not want your prescription drug t o be changed, the plan may not cover your drug if you ask the pharmacist to fill the prescription as written. Regardless of whether you or your prescribing provider ask the pharmacist to \"dispense as written,\" if you get the noncovered prescription drug, t he plan may not cover it. The pharmacy will contact your provider to request authorization for the substitution. If approved by the provider, you will receive the alternative preferred drug along with a letter of explanation. If the pharmacy cannot get an authorization from your provider within 48 hours, the prescription will be filled as written, and you will be charged the full price of the drug. Travel overrides for prescription drugs You may request a travel override to get an extra supply of prescript ion drugs for extended travel. All of the conditions listed below apply. You may request a travel override up to two weeks before your departure. You may request no more than two travel overrides per calendar year, including all travel within or outside th e U.S. Within the U.S., you may request up to a 90 -day supply per prescription, or as allowed under that prescription. Outside the U.S., you may request up to a six -month supply per prescription, or as allowed under that prescription. Travel overrides will be granted only while you are covered by the plan. If your eligibility is ending, the plan does not cover prescription drugs past the time your enrollment in the plan ends. You will pay applicable charges (deductible and coinsurance) for each extra supply received. To request a travel override, call WSRxS Customer Service . Refill too soon The plan will not cover a refill until 84 percent of the last prescription should be used up. Claims for therapeutic equivalents of the previously prescribed drug will al so be denied. This also applies if your 2023 UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificat e of Coverage 107prescription is damaged, destroyed, lost, or stolen. For example, if you get a 90 -day supply and you try to refill this prescription before 76 days have passed, coverage will be denied. However, in the event of an e mergency or other urgent circumstance, you may request an exception to override the refill too soon policy. The plan may require documentation to support your request. Approval of your request is at the sole discretion of the plan. Early refill for a natur al disaster You may request an early refill for your prescription when you need to evacuate for a natural disaster. To request an early refill or to locate pharmacies that remain open near you, call WSRxS Customer Service . What to do if the plan denies cov erage TIP: If your prescription claims are denied by the pharmacy due to plan eligibility issues or termination of coverage, contact: Employees: Your employer's payroll or benefits office. Retirees and PEBB Continuation Coverage: PEBB Program at 1 -800-200-1004 (TRS: 711). If a network pharmacy (including the mail -order or specialty drug pharmacy) tells you that preauthorization is required, coverage is denied, or quantities are limited, you, your pharmacist, or your prescribing pr ovider may call WSRxS Customer Service to request a coverage review or preauthorization. If WSRxS denies the coverage request, you have the right to submit an appeal (see the \"Complaint and appeal procedures\" section ). If your provider thinks you need the prescription drug immediately, they may request an expedited review by submitting all clinically relevant information to the plan by phone or fax. An expedited appeal replaces the first and second level appeals. WSRxS will decide on coverage of the pre scription drug within 72 hours of the request. In this case, you may choose to purchase a three -day supply at your own expense. Prescription drugs and products UMP does not cover Prescription drugs and products not covered under the prescription drug bene fit include, but are not limited to, noncovered prescription drugs and excluded drugs and products . Noncovered prescription drugs Noncovered prescription drugs without a UMP Preferred Drug List exception authorization For more information see the \"Noncove red prescription drugs \" section on page 88. Excluded drugs and products Dental preparations, such as rinses and pastes Dietary/food supplements, vitamins, minerals, herbal supplements, and medical foods Experimental or investigational prescription drugs Homeopathic drugs, including FDA -approved prescription products Over-the-counter drugs, products containing an over -the-counter drug, or prescription drugs that have a nonprescription alternative, except for the drugs specified under \"Exceptions covered\" on page 90, or otherwise listed on the UMP Preferred Drug List . 108 2023UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificate of CoverageNote: Prescription drugs with a nonprescription alternative \u2014 including an over -the-counter alternative having similar safety, efficacy, a nd ingredients \u2014 are excluded . Over -the-counter products not approved by and registered with the FDA Prescription drug costs covered by other insurance (see page 126 for coordination with other plans ) Prescription drugs not approved by the FDA Prescription drugs provided to a member, in whole or in part, while the member is admitted to an inpatient facility. Drugs provided in an inpatient setting are covered under th e medical benefit. Prescription drugs that are not medically necessary Prescription drugs that are repackaged Prescription drugs that the FDA's DESI classifications have found to be less than effective Prescription drugs under a REMS program required by t he FDA when prescribed outside REMS guidelines (see page 102 for details) Most p roducts considered as a medical device by the FDA. Medical devices may be covered und er your medical benefit The plan also excludes prescription drugs to treat conditions that are not covered under the medical benefit. These include, but are not limited to, prescription drugs for: Cosmetic purposes. Fertility or infertility. Obesity (or weight loss). Promoting hair growth. Sexual dysfunction. ALERT! Prescription drugs classified as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have over -the-counter alternatives and are not covered for persons ages 18 and over. The plan does cover PPIs for persons under age 18 when prescribed, because the available over -the-counter alternatives are not approved for persons under age 18. Limits on plan coverage If you receive a service that is not medically necessary, is experimental or investigational, is list ed as an exclusion in the \"What the plan does not cover\" section, or is listed as a noncovered or excluded prescription drug, you are responsible for paying all associated charges. Preauthorizing medical services ALERT! This section does not apply to presc ription drugs. See page 102 for how to request preauthorization of drugs covered under the prescription drug benefit.2023 UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificat e of Coverage 109The plan must preauthorize some medical services and supplies to determine whether the service or supply meets the plan's medical necessity criteria to be covered. The fact that a service or supply is prescribed or furnished by a provider does not, by itself, make it a medically necessary covered service . Preauthorization is not a guarantee of coverage. A change after the plan has approved a preauthorization request \u2014 including, but not limited to, a change of provider or different/additional services \u2014 requires you r provider to submit a new preauthorization request and for the plan to approve it. Your preauthorization role ALERT! Excluded, experimental, and investig ational services do not require a preauthorization because they are not covered by the plan. To confirm whether a service is covered, call UMP Customer Service. To be covered, some services, including, but not limited to, Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) Th erapy for members ages 18 and older (see page 39) and bariatric surgery (see page 39), must be preauthorized before services are received. A preferred or participating provider may be required to request preauthorization before providing services. An out -of-network provider is not obligated to obtain prior authorization for ser vices that require a preauthorization because they do not have a contract with Regence. If an out -of-network provider does not obtain a required preauthorization in advance of the service, you will be responsible for all charges billed to you. You are enc ouraged to request that an out -of-network provider preauthorize certain services on your behalf to determine medical necessity before the services are provided. They have the clinical details and technical billing information needed to submit a request. Ca ll UMP Customer Service to ask if a service requires preauthorization and how to submit a request. You may be liable for all charges if you receive services that are determined to be not medically necessary, experimental or investigational, or not covered under this plan (see the \"What the plan does not cover\" section). ALERT! See the \"Complaint and appeal procedures\" section for how to appeal denial of a preauthorization request before receiving services. List of services and supplies requiring preauthoriz ation or notice For a list of services and supplies requiring preauthorization or notice: Visit the UMP Policies that affect your care webpage . Call UMP Customer Service to request a printed list or ask questions. See the Directory pages at the beginning of this booklet for links and contact information.110 2023UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificate of CoverageALERT! The UMP preauthorization list is updated throughout the year. You may find a link to the current list o f services that require preauthorization on the UMP Policies that affect your care webpage or call UMP Customer Service to determine if services require preauthorization or notice. The fact that a service does not require preauthorization or notice does no t guarantee coverage. Notice for facility admissions Your provider must notify the plan upon your admission to a facility for services requiring plan notice. You may find a list of services requiring plan notice by visiting the UMP Policies that affect your care webpage or calling UMP Customer Service (see Directory for link and contact information) . Facility admissions for which the plan is not notified may not be covered. Notice is usually done by the facility at the time you are admitted. Notic e is not the same as preauthorization and many services require both. What is the difference between preauthorization and notice? ALERT! Many services, including, but not limited to, inpatient services, require both preauthorization and notice. Call UMP Cu stomer Service or talk to your provider if you have questions about services needing preauthorization or notice. \"Preauthorization\" is when your provider sends a request for coverage of a service on the UMP preauthorization list . Preauthorization is usuall y requested by the provider performing the services. The plan sends either an approval or denial of coverage. If the plan does not approve services that require preauthorization before services are received, the plan may deny coverage. The plan does not a pprove or deny preauthorization for services that are not on the UMP preauthorization list. \"Notice\" means that your provider must contact the plan to let us know when you receive services. Notice is usually done by the facility when you are admitted. ALERT! If the plan denies preauthorization and you receive those services anyway, you are responsible for the provider's entire billed charge. How long the plan has to make a decision You will be notified in writing within 15 calendar days of the plan receivi ng the preauthorization request whether the request has been approved, denied, or if more information is needed to make a decision. If additional information is requested: You are allowed up to 45 calendar days from the date on the letter to submit the inf ormation requested. You will be notified in writing of the decision within 15 calendar days from either the plan receiving the additional requested information or the end of the 45 -day period if no additional information is received.2023 UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificat e of Coverage 111If you or your provide r believes that waiting for a decision under the standard time frame could place your life, health, or ability to regain maximum function in serious danger, your provider should notify the plan by phone or fax as a shorter time limit may apply. This is als o known as an expedited preauthorization request . Regence BlueShield will decide on your expedited preauthorization request within 72 hours of receipt. General information from UMP Customer Service For services not requiring preauthorization, you may call UMP Customer Service to ask if a particular service is generally covered by the plan, and for an estimate of how much you will pay. The plan does not approve or deny preauthorization for services th at are not on the UMP preauthorization list. Until a claim is submitted and reviewed, the plan cannot guarantee that your service will be covered or give you an exact amount you will pay out of pocket. This is because when a provider bills for a service, the plan pays for it based on procedure codes. Each code describes a service in some detail, and there are many codes for similar -sounding services. Your provider, not the plan, determines which of these codes is used on the submitted claim. Alternative ben efits Alternative benefits mean benefits for services or supplies that are not otherwise covered as specified in this COC, but for which the plan may approve coverage after case management evaluation. The plan may cover alternative benefits through case ma nagement (see the \"Care management\" benefit ) if the plan determines that alternative benefits are medically necessary and will result in overall reduced covered costs and improved quality of care. Before alternative benefits will be covered, the plan, you (or your legal representative), and, if required by the plan, your physician or other provider, must enter into a written agreement of the terms and conditions for payment. Alternative benefits are approved on a case -specific basis only. Approval of an alternative benefit applies to only the services and member listed in the written agreement. The rest of this COC remains in effect. What the plan does not cover TIP: If you have any questions about services the plan does not cover, call UMP Customer Service or WSRxS Customer Service. This plan covers only the services and conditions specifically identified in this COC. Unless a service or condition fits into one of the specific benefit definitions, it is not covered. You may pay all costs associated with a noncovered service. Here are some examples of common services and conditions that are not covered. Many others are also not covered \u2014 these are examples only, not a complete list. These examples are called exclusions, meaning these services are not covered , even if the services are medically necessary. 1. Activity therapy.

If you have other medical coverage FOR MEDICARE RETIREES: Different rules apply to members who have Medicare as their primary payer. See the \" How UMP Classic and Medicare work together \" section for how UMP Classic works with Medic are. Coordination of benefits Coordination of benefits (COB) happens when you have health coverage through two or more groups (such as your employer and your spouse's employer), and these two group health plans both pay a portion of your health care claims . The rules beginning under the \"Who pays first\" section determine which plan pays first (primary payer) and which pays second (secondary payer). See page 124 for a description of how the plan coordinates benefits when it pays second. The plan processes claims differently depending on if it is the primary payer or the secondary payer. The differences are described in the next several pages. TIP: If you have other health coverage, it is important that you let your providers know, including the pharmacies where you get your prescription drugs.122 2023UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificate of CoverageContact UMP and WSRxS If you or your dependents have other insurance, you must let UMP and WSRxS know so claims are processed correctly. To do this, you must complete and submit a separate form for medical services and prescription drugs. Each person claiming payment for benefits under the plan is required to give Regence and WSRxS any facts needed to apply these COB rules . If your coverage under other plans changes, you must let UMP and WSRxS know so claims are processed correctly. See the Directory pages at the beginning of this booklet for contact information and ways to get and submit COB forms . Who pays first Note: If you cannot determine which plan pays first, call UMP Customer Service. Alert: Medicare will be the primary payer for covered benefits provided to Medicare -eligible members who are enrolled in UMP as a dependent of a currently employed state -registered domestic partner. Medicare will remain the secondary payer for benefits payable un der UMP for (1) individuals age 65 or over who have UMP as a result of their own current employee status, or (2) individuals age 65 or over who have UMP as a result of the current employment status of a spouse of any age. When UMP coordinates benefits with other plans, the following rules determine which plan pays first. These rules apply in order, so the first rule below that applies to your situation will determine which plan is your primary coverage, and subsequent rules will not apply. The following pla n pays first: Any group plan that does not coordinate benefits. The plan that covers the member as a subscriber, not a dependent. Exception: When the subscriber is a Medicare beneficiary, the plan covering the person as the retiree is secondary to the plan covering the person as a dependent. The plan that covers the member (or their spouse or state -registered domestic partner) as an active employee pays before a plan that covers the member as a retired employee. A plan covering the member as an emp loyee, subscriber, retiree, or the dependent of such an employee, subscriber, or retiree will pay before a COBRA or a state right of continuation plan. If the other plan is Medicare, UMP pays first if the member is age 65 or over who have UMP as a result of their own active employee status or the active employee status of a spouse of any age. Note: Medicare benefits are primary to UMP for members who are enrolled in UMP as a dependent of a currently employed state -registered domestic partner. The plan t hat has covered the member (or their spouse or state -registered domestic partner) as a subscriber the longest, if there are two plans and the first five bullets do not determine which plan pays first. If none of the preceding rules determines the order of benefits, the allowable expenses must be shared equally between the plans. For dependent children A group plan is usually primary over Medicaid programs that cover children. If a dependent child has group coverage through their employer, the child's cove rage pays first.2023 UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificat e of Coverage 123Dependent children of married parents The group plan of the parent whose birthday is earlier in the year pays first. For example, the plan of a parent born April 14 is primary over the plan of a parent born August 21. This is called the \"b irthday rule.\" This rule looks only at the month and day, not the year. If both parents have the same birthday, the plan that has covered either parent the longest is primary. Exception for newborn children Under Washington State law, the plan must cover newborns under the mother's coverage for the first 21 days of life. Therefore, the mother's plan pays first for covered charges during the first 21 days of a newborn's life. Dependent children of legally separated or divorced parents When no court order sp ecifies which parent is responsible for providing health insurance coverage, the following standard COB rules determine which plan pays first: 1. The plan of the custodial parent. 2. The plan of the custodial parent's spouse, if the custodial parent has remarried. 3. The plan of the non -custodial parent. 4. The plan of the non -custodial parent's spouse, if the non -custodial parent has remarried. The custodial parent is the parent awarded custody by a court decree or, in the absence of a court decree, is the par ent with whom the child resides more than one half of the calendar year, excluding any temporary visitation. The birthday rule is used to determine which parent's plan pays first if: The court order states that both parents are responsible for the child's/ children's health coverage and expenses. The court order awards joint custody without specifying that one parent is responsible for the child's/children's health coverage and expenses. If the court order states one parent is to assume primary financial res ponsibility for the child but does not specify that one parent is responsible for health coverage and health care expenses, the plan of the parent assuming financial responsibility is the primary payer. In some cases, a court order determines payment for h ealth care expenses. In those cases, standard COB rules may not apply. You must promptly provide the plan with copies of the court order for the plan to determine which plan pays first. If a dependent child is covered under more than one plan through perso ns who are not the child's parent or stepparent (e.g., a grandparent or other guardian), the plan will use the birthday rule to determine which plan pays first. If none of the preceding rules determine who pays first, then each plan covers half of the allo wed expenses. Federal and military plans UMP usually pays first over certain federal or military programs for veterans (retired military members). When UMP pays first When the plan is the primary payer (pays first), UMP pays its normal benefit as described in this COC. You may need to send UMP's Explanation of Benefits and a copy of your provider's bill to your secondary payer to receive payment. Check with that plan for more information.124 2023UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificate of CoverageWhen UMP is supposed to pay first, but another plan did instead If another plan pays first on claims where UMP should have paid first: UMP may pay the other plan the amount UMP should have paid. Amounts UMP pays to the other plan are considered benefits paid by UMP. How UMP coordinates benefits when it pays second FOR MEDIC ARE RETIREES: For more detail on how Medicare and UMP Classic interact when Medicare pays first, and UMP Classic pays second, see page 127. UMP uses a type of COB ca lled nonduplication of benefits ( see definition of \"Nonduplication of benefits\" ). When UMP pays second to another plan that covers the member, UMP will pay only an amount needed to bring the total benefit up to the amount UMP would have paid if the member did not have another plan. The intent of this type of COB is to maintain the l evel of benefits available through UMP. The nonduplication of benefits type of coordination is not designed to pay your covered expenses in full. When UMP pays second, it coordinates with these types of plans: Governmental programs including, but not limited to, Medicare and Medicaid. Group, blanket, or franchise health or disability insurance policies; health care service contractor and health maintenance organization group agreements issued by insurers; health care service contractors; and health mai ntenance organizations. Labor management trusteed plans, labor organization plans, employer plans, or employee benefit organization plans. ALERT! If you have other primary coverage that pays for services, those services will apply to the UMP benefit limit. How much you may pay when UMP pays second When you see preferred providers under UMP, you will owe only the balance of the UMP allowed amount after your primary plan and UMP pay benefits for covered services. Your cost will usually be higher if you see o ut-of-network providers. See the \"Sample payments to different provider types\" section for examples. The examples in the table below assume that you have met your medical deductible. Situation Example Preferred provider chargeUMP allowed amountUMP norm al benefitOther plan paysUMP paysYou pay your provider UMP is primary, other plan is secondaryEXAMPLE 1: When UMP pays first (or is the $100 $85 (85% of Example Preferred provider chargeUMP allowed amountUMP norm al benefitOther plan paysUMP paysYou pay your provider other plan is primaryThe other plan pays less than the normal UMP benefit UMP is secondary, other plan is primaryEXAMPLE 3: The other plan pays as much as (or more than) the normal UMP benefit$200 $100 $85 $85 $0 $15 Contact UMP Customer Service for help with any questions if you are covered by more than one plan. Submit secondary claims promptly All health plans have a \"timely submitting \" deadline. The timely submitting deadline for UMP is 12 months from the date of service. If a claim is not submitted within the plan's timely submitting deadline, UMP will deny it. If your primary plan delays payment on a claim, you must still submit to UMP within the submitting deadline to prevent denial of the claim. UMP may try to contact your primary plan for their benefit payment information or may estimate it to provide timely processing of your secondary benefit. Adjustments may be made when the primary plan pays their portion of your claim. Notifying your providers of any change to your cov erage will help avoid errors and delays in processing of claims (see the \" Billing and payment: submitting a claim \" section ). How diabetes care supplies are covered when UMP pays second FOR MEDICARE RETIREES: If Medicare is your primary health coverage, see \"Diabetes care supplies when Medicare pays first\" on page 129 for information on how claims for diabetes care sup plies are processed. UMP covers diabetes care supplies under the prescription drug benefit. If you get your supplies from a pharmacy, ask if the pharmacy can bill both your primary plan and UMP. If your pharmacy does, you do not need to do anything further. If not, you will need to send a claim to WSRxS for secondary payment (see the \"Submitting a claim for prescription drugs \" section for instructions). If you get your supplies from a diabetes care supplier, the primary plan may process the claim as medical. In this case, you need to send your Explanation of Benefits and a claim form to WSRxS for secondary payment (see the \" Submitting a claim for prescription drugs \" and the \" False claims or statements \" sections for instructions). Note: Nonduplication of benefits applies to these claims, which means that UMP may pay nothing after your primary plan pays. See the \"Diabetes care supplies\" benefit for more information .126 2023UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificate of CoverageALERT! You must submit secondary claims for diabetes care supplies to WSRxS. Regence BlueShield will deny these claims. How COB works with prescription drugs Some of the limits and restrictions to prescription drug coverage listed in the \" Limits on your prescription drug coverage \" section will apply when UMP pays second to another plan. See the \"Submitting a claim for prescription drugs\" sectio n for how to submit your prescription drug claim. Nonduplication of benefits applies when UMP pays second to another plan. This means that UMP may pay nothing after your primary plan pays. ALERT! If UMP p ays second, you must still meet your prescription drug deductible before UMP covers Tier 2 drugs. Using network pharmacies when UMP is secondary If you have primary coverage through another plan that covers prescription drugs, show both plan member ID cards to the pharmacy and make sure they know which plan pays first and which plan pays second. It is important that the pharmacy bills the plans in the correct order, or claims may be denied or paid incorrectly. Using mail -order pharmacies when UMP is sec ondary If your primary plan also uses one of UMP's network mail -order pharm acies as the plan's network - order pharmacy, UMP's network mail -order pharm acies may process payments for both plans and charge you only the remainder. Make sure that UMP's netw ork mail -order pharm acies have the information for both plans and know which plan is primary. However, if your primary plan uses a different mail -order pharmacy, you will have to use your primary plan's mail-order pharmacy, then submit a paper claim to UMP . See the \"Submitting a claim for prescription drugs\" section for how to do this. For retirees enrolled in Medicare and UMP Classic FOR MEDICARE RETIREES: When you see this format throughout this COC, it gives specific tips for Medicare retirees. Are you a Medicare retiree? You are considered a Medicare retiree if all the following apply. You are: Enrolled in PEBB retiree insurance coverage; Age 65 or older (or younger and eligible for Medicare due to medical disability); and Enrolled in both Medicare Part A (hospital) and Part B (medical).2023 UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificat e of Coverage 127Alert ! If you are the subscriber and are an employee, see \"When UMP Classic pays first and Medicare pays second\" below for coverage when UMP Classic pays before Medicare. This also applies to dependents enrolled in UMP Cl assic under an employee's account. How UMP Classic and Medicare work together Because Medicare pays first, a few rules are different for Medicare retirees. This section tells you about these rules, including: How UMP Classic and Medicare work together. What UMP Classic covers that Medicare does not cover. What your choices for providers are. How billing works. How your prescription drug coverage works. Where to go for more information. To enroll in PEBB retiree insurance coverage, retirees and their eligible dependents who are eligible for Medicare are required to enroll in Medicare Part A and Part B. If a retiree or an enrolled dependent becomes eligible for Medicare after enrollment in UMP, they must enroll in Medicare Part A and Part B. Enrol lment in Medicare Part A and Part B must be maintained to remain enrolled in a PEBB retiree health plan. You may not enroll in a Medicare Part D drug plan and be covered by UMP. Your monthly premiums will be lower because Medicare pays part of your medical costs. Be sure to tell Medicare you are enrolled in UMP so that they send us your claims after Medicare processes them. If you are retired but you or an eligible dependent are not yet eligible to enroll in Medicare Part A and Part B, this section does not apply to you. If you think you might be eligible for Medicare and need information on how to sign up, see the \"Medicare eligibility and enrollment \" section. When UMP Classic pays first and Medicare pays second If UMP Classic pays first and Medicare pays s econd, make sure that you tell Medicare about your UMP Classic coverage and that your provider agrees to bill Medicare as secondary to get the maximum benefit from both plans. Medicare generally accepts claims only from providers, so you may not be able to send a claim to Medicare for secondary payment. The provider would need to bill Medicare after UMP Classic has processed the claim. Note: Medicare accepts claims directly from members only under certain circumstances. FOR MEDICARE RETIREES: UMP Classic d oes not bill Medicare or in any way coordinate benefits with Medicare when Medicare is the secondary payer. When Medicare pays first and UMP Classic pays second UMP Classic and Medicare are two separate health plans that work together to pay for covered se rvices and supplies. Here is how coordination of benefits works: Your providers bill Medicare. Medicare pays your claims first. After Medicare processes the claim, Medicare sends the claim to UMP Classic.128 2023UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificate of Coverage UMP Classic pays your claims second. For most covered services, UMP Classic pays the rest of the Medicare allowed amount and you owe $0. Each calendar year, you must meet the UMP Classic medical deductible before UMP Classic starts paying benefits. If you receive more covered services during the same calendar year, you may be reimbursed for at least some of your UMP Classic deductible. That reimbursement will come from the COB savings. This savings is the part of your UMP benefit saved because Medicare pays part of your claims. See the \"Why you might get a COB savings check from UMP Classic\" section. Note: Services apply to the UMP medical deductible in the order claims are received, not necessarily in the order the member receives the services. Paying the UMP Classic and Medicare deductibles If you meet the UMP Classic deductible, you do not pay both the Medicare Part B and the UMP Classic deductible. The Part B deductible is a part of the same total calendar year expenses processed by UMP Classic. An examp le is below. This example assumes you received care from a provider who accepts Medicare (has not \"opted out\" of Medicare) anywhere in the U.S. Benefit calculation Amount Medicare allowed amount $600 Medicare deductible $183 Subtract Medicare deductible from allowed amount: $600 - $183 = $417 Medicare pays amount ( 0.80 x $417) = $333.60 remaining after Medicare pays: $600 - $333.60 = $266.40 UMP Classic allowed amount $600 UMP Classic deductible $250 Subtract UMP Classic deductible from allowed amount: $600 - $250 = $350 Normal UMP Classic benefit of this amount) ( 0.85 x $350) = $297.50 Since the UMP Classic benefit available (dollar amount) is greater than the balance, UMP pays the balance remaining after Medicare pays:$266.40 The difference between the normal UMP Classic benefit and the amount UMP paid is: This amount is considered \"COB savings\" (see page 131).$31.10 Note: This is an example only and may not apply to your specific situation. Example of COB when Medicare pays first and UMP Classic pays second Below is an example to show how the COB process works after you have met your UMP Classic medical deductible and Medicare deductible. This example assumes you received care from a provider who accepts Medicare (has not \"opted out\" of Medicare) anywhere in the U.S. Benefit calculation Amount Provider's billed charge $300 Medicare allowed amount $100 Medicare pays $80 (80% of $100) Remaining amount $20 UMP Classic allowed amount$100 UMP Classic normal benefit$85 (85% of $100)2023 UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificat e of Coverage 129Benefit calculation Amount UMP Classic pays $20 You pay $0 COB savings accrued $65 ($85 - $20 =$65) The $65 of the normal UMP Classic benefit not paid on this claim is tracked as part of your COB savings. That excess benefit may be used to reimburse you directly for your UMP Classic medical deductible met earlier in the same year or used to pay more on a service covered by UMP Classic, but not covered by Medicare. See the \"Why you might get a COB savings check from UMP Classic\" section. In this example, you owe $0 because the provider accepts Medicare. You may still have to pay coinsurance and deductible amounts when you have not fully met your Medicare deductibles, or when Medicare does not cover a service. If UMP Classic covers a service or supply not covered by Medicare, then the benefit will be the normal UMP Classic benefit plus any COB savings you ma y have accrued in the same calendar year, up to allowed amount for the claim. If a provider does not bill Medicare for services covered by Medicare, UMP Classic may not cover services. Medicare accepts claims from members only under certain circumstances, and UMP Classic processes claims for services covered by Medicare only after Medicare has processed them. See the \"What UMP Classic covers that Medicare does not\" section below for exceptions. Ask your provider if they bill Medicare. Diabetes care supplie s when Medicare pays first Medicare pays claims for some diabetes care supplies under the Part B medical benefit. As a result, UMP Classic pays the claim under the DME benefit, not the prescription drug benefit. This means you will have to meet your medica l deductible before UMP Classic begins to pay on diabetes care supplies claims, then UMP Classic pays its share based on medical benefit coinsurance (85 percent of the allowed amount for providers that accept Medicare). See also the \"Diabetes care supplies\" benefit for more information. What UMP Classic covers that Medicare does not FOR MEDICARE RETIREES: Services listed below are paid at the standard rate. You will pay more if you use out -of-network providers for these services. UMP Classic covers some services that Medicare does not cover. For these services, it does not matter if the provider accepts Medicare, because Medicare does not cover the service. You will receive the highest level of benefit if you choose a preferred provider. Services lis ted below are not covered by Medicare, but they are covered by UMP Classic. Out -of-network providers may balance bill you. Services not covered by Medicare Part A or Part B include, but are not limited to: Hearing aids. Hearing exams for getting a hearing aid. Massage therapy (a massage therapist must be a preferred provider).130 2023UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificate of Coverage Naturopathic medicine. Prescription drugs (see \"Use network pharmacies that bill Medicare Part B directly\" on page 132 for exceptions). Routine vision exams and hardware. (Medicare covers medical vision exams and vision hardware following cataract surgery.) Services outside of the U.S. (see the \" Services received outside the United States \" section for details). Wigs for cancer patients (see page 48). If you see a preferred provider, they will submit the claim for you. For out -of-network providers, check if the provider will submit the claim. If not, you will need to send a claim to UMP Classic. See the \"Billing and payment: submitting a claim\" section. When to see a preferred provider FOR MEDICARE RETIREES: Preferred providers do not necessarily accept M edicare. You should always ask. To find preferred providers outside the U.S., see page 23. Type of service Higher benefits with UMP preferred provider?Important in formation Services covered by Medicare No You should see a provider who accepts Medicare. See \"When providers do not accept Medicare\" on page 131 to learn why this is important. Services covered by UMP Classic but not by MedicareYes See \"What UMP Classic covers that Medicare does not\" starting on page 129 to see which services apply. Use the provider search on the UMP website at ump.regence.com/go/ pebb / UMP -Classic , or call UMP Customer Service , to find a preferred provider. Massage therapy Yes UMP Classic pays for massage therapy services only when the provider is preferred. Prescription drugs Yes You must also choose pharmacies that participate in and may bill Medicare Part B directly. See \"Use network pharmacies that bill Medicare Part B directly\" on page 132 for more information.2023 UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificat e of Coverage 131When providers do not accept Medicare When services are covered by Medicare, you must see providers who accept Medicare for the services to be covered by Medicare and UMP Classic. If your provider is not contracted with Medicare or has chosen to \"opt out\" of participating in Medicare, UMP Clas sic will not cover services by that provider, even if the provider is in the Regence or Blue Card network (preferred) for UMP Classic members (see the \"Finding a health care provider \" section ). Providers that opt out of Medicare are supposed to have you si gn a private contract before providing services, but you are responsible for all costs even if you did not sign a contract. When you pay: How billing works Most of the time, you pay only after both Medicare and UMP Classic have processed your claim. Here i s how it typically works: 1. Your provider bills Medicare. 2. Medicare processes the claim and sends you a Medicare Summary Notice (MSN). An MSN may also be called an Explanation of Medicare Benefits ( EOMB ). The MSN tells you how much Medicare paid on your claim. 3. Medicare then sends the claim to UMP Classic for processing. You do not need to submit a claim form or other paperwork to UMP Classic. 4. UMP Classic processes the claim and sends you an Explanation of Benefits (EOB). The EOB tells you how much UMP Cla ssic and Medicare paid, plus how much you owe the provider. 5. You receive a bill from your provider for any remaining amount due. To confirm that the provider has credited your account with both Medicare and UMP Classic payments: Note the allowed amount on t he Medicare MSN . Subtract both Medicare's and UMP Classic's payments from that amount. This should match the bill from your provider. 6. You pay your provider the amount due, if any. After you've met both your Medicare and UMP Classic deductibles, you will no t pay anything for most claims. If you have not received any paperwork on a health care service within three months, call your provider's billing office and ask if they have sent the claim. Neither Medicare nor UMP Classic may process a claim they have not received. While you are welcome to call UMP Classic and ask, if we have not received the claim, we will not have any record of the service. Why you might get a COB savings check from UMP Classic At the beginning of the year, you must first satisfy your Me dicare and UMP Classic deductibles to receive coordination of benefits (COB) savings. Once you have satisfied these deductibles in full and receive more health care services during the year, UMP Classic usually pays less than its normal benefit when it is a secondary payer to Medicare. The difference between what UMP Classic pays as the secondary plan and what UMP Classic would have paid had it been the primary payer, is your COB savings. UMP Classic keeps track of how much you've paid out of pocket during the year. If your Medicare coverage generates COB savings, we may send you a \"COB savings check\" to pay you back for the out -of- pocket expenses you paid earlier in the year. UMP Classic does not reimburse you for more than you paid out of pocket. See the \"How UMP Classic and Medicare work together\" section for examples. 132 2023UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificate of CoverageHow UMP Classic prescription drug coverage works with Medicare FOR MORE INFORMATION: See the \"Your prescription drug benefit\" section for complete information about your prescription drug c overage. Use network pharmacies that bill Medicare Part B directly ALERT! UMP's network mail -order pharmac ies cannot bill Medicare for diabetes care supplies when Medicare is your primary coverage. To find a Medicare -approved mail -order pharmacy for diabet es care supplies, contact Medicare at 1 -800-MEDICARE (1 -800-633-4227) (TTY: 1 - 877-486-2048) . Most prescription drugs or supplies covered under Medicare Part B are paid as medical. When paying secondary to Medicare Part B, UMP Classic also pays under the me dical benefit. Therefore, these charges are subject to the medical deductible. For those drugs and medical supplies covered under your prescription drug benefit, we recommend that you choose a network pharmacy that may bill Medicare Part B directly to get the most from your prescription drug coverage. Medicare Part B does cover a few drugs and supplies for specific purposes. Note: Medicare Part B quantity restrictions may apply. Medicare accepts claims only from pharmacies, not from individuals. If Medicar e covers a prescription drug or supply and the pharmacy does not send the claim to Medicare first for payment, UMP Classic will deny the claim. To find a network retail pharmacy, see the pharmacy locator on the UMP Prescription drug coverage webpage or call WSRxS Customer Service (see Directory for link and contact information ). You may not have UMP Classic and Medicare Part D You may not enroll in both UMP Classic and a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan. UMP Classic provides your prescription drug coverage and you may not have both. Medicare will notify the PEBB Program if you enroll in a Part D plan while enrolled in UMP Classic. You could lose your eligibility for PEBB retiree health plan coverage if you do this. If you think you want a Part D prescription drug plan, you must change your medical plan from UMP Classic to a PEBB Medicare Supplement Plan . See \"Medicare Part D\" on page 170 or more information. Contact the PEBB Program at 1 -800-200-1004 (TRS: 711) to ask when and how you may change your PEBB medical plan.

You or your provider must submit claims within 12 months of the date you received health care services. This is called the \"timely submitting \" deadline. The plan will not pay claims submitted more than 12 months after the date of service. See \"Submit seco ndary claims promptly\" on page 125 for how this works when you have other coverage that pays first. For information about submitting claims for services outside of t he U.S., call UMP Customer Service . You may have to pay services upfront and submit a claim for reimbursement. If you have other health care coverage, see the \"If you have other medical coverage\" section for information on how the plan coordinates benefit s with other plans. Services apply to the UMP medical deductible in the order claims are received, not necessarily in the order the member receives services. Claims reimbursement Most of the time, the plan will pay preferred or participating providers dir ectly. For claims submitted by you or an out -of-network provider, the plan will determine whether to pay you, the provider, or both. For a child covered by a legal qualified medical child support order (see page 122) the plan may pay the child's custodial parent or legal guardian. Claims determinations The plan will notify you of action taken on a claim within 30 days of the plan receiving it. This 30 -day period may be extended by 15 days when action cannot be taken on the claim due to: Circumstances beyond the plan's control.

The plan will notify you within the 30 -day period that an extension is necessary, with a description of the information needed and why it is needed. Submitting a claim for prescription drugs You may need to submit your own prescription drug claim to WSRxS for reimb ursement if you: Buy prescription drugs at a non -network retail pharmacy. Fail to show your UMP member ID card at a network pharmacy. Have other prescription coverage that pays first, and UMP is secondary.

Prescription drug claim forms are available by visiting forms and publications at hca.wa.gov/ump -forms - pubs or by calling WSRxS Customer Service. Send the completed claim form, along with your pharmacy receipt(s), to:136 2023UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificate of Box 999 Appleton, WI 54912 -0999 It is a good idea to keep copies of all your paperwork for your records. When you submit a prescription drug claim to WSRxS, the plan pays the claim based on the following rules, no matter where you purchased the drug: The plan pays based on the allowed amount. If the pharmacy charges you more than the allowed amount, you will pay your usual coinsurance (and prescription drug deductible if applicable), plus the difference between what the plan paid and the pharmacy's charge. The plan pays all pre scription drug claims, including non -network retail pharmacies, based on the drug's tier coinsurance (see the \"What you pay for prescription drugs\" section ). If your claim exceeds the quantity limit or the maximum days' supply allowed by the plan, the plan will pay only for the amount of the prescription drug up to the quantity limit or maximum days' supply. If you receive a refill before 84 percent of the last supply you received should have been taken, the plan will not pay for it. This is called a \"refil l too soon\" (see page 106). You must submit prescription drug claims within 12 months of purchase. The plan will not pay claims for prescription drugs submitted mor e than 12 months after purchase or prescription drugs purchased from an excluded pharmacy. See the definition of \"Excluded pharmacy .\" ALERT!

False claims or statements Neither you nor your provider (or any person acting for you or your provider) may submit a claim for services or sup plies that were not received, were resold to another party, or for which you are not expected to pay. In addition, neither you nor any person acting for you may make any false or incomplete statements or any false claims on any document for your plan cover age. The plan may recover any payments or overpayments made because of a false claim or false statement by withholding future claim payments, by suing you, or by other means. False claims may also be crimes. If you represent yourself as being enrolled in t his plan when you are not, the plan will deny all claims. If the plan asks you for more information, you will be allowed at least 45 days to provide it. If the plan does not receive the information requested within the time allowed, the plan will deny the claim.2023 UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificat e of Coverage 137Complaint and appeal procedures ALERT!

If you request payment for denied claims or approval o f services, supplies, or prescription drugs not yet covered by the plan, the plan will not cover the services, supplies, or prescription drugs while the appeal is under consideration. First-level and second -level appeal reviewers Claim processing dispute s will be reviewed by administrative staff. The plan will consult with a health care professional employed by Regence BlueShield on medical appeals, or with a health care professional employed by Washington State Rx Services on prescription drug appeals, w hen appeals involve issues requiring medical judgment about covering, authorizing, or providing health care. That includes decisions based on determinations that a treatment, prescription drug, or other item is experimental, investigational, or not medical ly necessary.

This in cludes any arbitration award, judgment, settlement, disputed claim settlement, underinsured or uninsured motorist payment, or any other recovery related to the injury or illness for which benefits under the plan have been provided or advanced . The plan may choose to recover expenses directly from the third party (or third party's insurer) responsible for your injury or illness. This is called subrogation . The plan is authorized, but not obligated, to recover any expenses, to the extent that they were paid under the plan, directly from any party liable to you, upon mailing of a written notice to the potential payer, to you, or to your representative. The plan's rights apply without regard to the source of payment for medical expenses, whether from the procee ds of any settlement, arbitration award, or judgment, or other characterization of the recovery by you or any third party or the recovery source. The plan is entitled to reimbursement from the first dollar received from any recovery to the extent that the settlement or recovery exceeds full compensation to you for the injury or illness that you sustained. This applies regardless of whether:144 2023UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificate of Coverage The third party or third party's insurer admits liability; The health care expenses are itemized or expressly excluded in the recovery; or The recovery includes any amount (in whole or in part) for services, supplies, or accommodations covered under the plan. You may be required to sign and deliver all legal papers and take any other actions requested to secure the plan's rights (including an assignment of rights to pursue your claim if you fail to pursue your claim of recovery from the third party or other source). If you are asked to sign a trust/reimbursement agreement or other document to reimburse the plan from the pr oceeds of any recovery, you will be required to do so as a condition to advancement of any benefits. If you or your agent or attorney fail to comply during the course of the case, we may request refunds from the providers or offset future benefits. You will not do anything to prejudice the plan's rights and that you will cooperate fully with the plan, including signing any documents within the required time and providing prompt notice of any settlement or other recovery. You must notify the plan of any f acts that may impact the right to reimbursement or subrogation, including, but not necessarily limited to, the following: The filing of a lawsuit; The making of a claim against any third party; Scheduling of settlement negotiations with a minimum of 21 day s advance notice of the date, time, location and participants to be involved in any settlement conferences or mediations); or Intent of a third party to make payment of any kind to your benefit or on your behalf and that in any manner relates to the injury or illness that gives rise to the plan's right of reimbursement or subrogation (notice is required a minimum of five business days before the settlement). You and your agent or attorney must agree to keep segregated in its own account any recovery or paym ent of any kind to your benefit that in any manner relates to the injury or illness giving rise to the plan's right of reimbursement or subrogation, until the plan's right is satisfied or released.

Any benefits provided or advanced under the plan are provided or advanced solely to assist you. By paying such benefits, the plan is not waiving any right to reimbursement or subrogation.

An employee or their dependent who is enrolled in Medicare may remain enrolled in PEBB medical coverage. However, an employee may choose to waive their PEBB medical coverage or remove their dependent from their PEBB medical coverage and choose Medicare as their primary insurer. If an employee does so, neither the employee nor their dependent can enroll in PEBB medical except during the annual open enrollment or a special open enrollment. 156 2023UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificate of CoverageIn most situations, an employee and their dependent can defer Medicare Part B enrollment without a penalty while enrolled in PEBB medical coverage.

Definitions Allowed amount, medical services Allowed amoun t for medical services is the most the plan pays for a specific covered service or supply. The allowed amount is determined as follows: For preferred providers that are within the Regence BlueShield service area, the Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) contract with Regence BlueShield is the relevant contract that determines the allowed amount. For preferred providers that are outside the Regence BlueShield se rvice area, the contract with another Blue Cross or Blue Shield organization in the BlueCard\u00ae Program for its PPO network is the relevant contract that determines the allowed amount. For participating providers that are within the Regence BlueShield servic e area, the participating provider contract with Regence BlueShield is the relevant contract that determines the allowed amount. For participating providers that are outside the Regence BlueShield service area, the contract with another Blue Cross or Blue Shield organization in the BlueCard\u00ae Program is the relevant contract that determines the allowed amount. For out -of-network providers who are within the Regence BlueShield service area and not contracted with Regence BlueShield, the amount Regence has det ermined to be reasonable charges for covered services and supplies is the allowed amount. The allowed amount may be based upon the billed charges for some services, as determined by Regence or as otherwise required by law. If a provider is not in the netwo rk, as described above, but has a contract with Regence, the allowed amount is based on the negotiated rate. For out -of-network providers accessed through the BlueCard\u00ae Program , the allowed amount is the lower of the provider's billed charges and the amount that the other Blue plan identifies as the amount on which it would base a payment to that provider. Under the BlueCard\u00ae Program, when you access covered services within the geographic area served by a Host Blue, Regence BlueShield will remain respo nsible for fulfilling contractual obligations. However, the Host Blue is responsible for contracting with and generally handling all interactions with its network providers. Whenever you access covered services outside Regence BlueShield's service area and the claim is processed through the BlueCard\u00ae Program, the amount you pay for covered services is calculated based on the lower of: The covered billed charges for your covered services; or The negotiated price that the Host Blue makes available to Regence. Often, this negotiated price will be a simple discount that reflects an actual price that the Host Blue pays to your health care provider. Sometimes, it is an estimated price that considers special arrangements with your health care provider or provider g roup that may include types of settlements, incentive payments, and/or other credits or charges. Occasionally, it may be an average price, based on a discount that results in expected average savings for similar types of health care providers after conside ring the same types of transactions as with an estimated price. Estimated pricing and average pricing, going forward, also consider adjustments to correct for over - or underestimation of modifications of past pricing for the types of transaction modificati ons noted above. 2023 UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificat e of Coverage 181However, such adjustments will not affect the price Regence uses for your claim because they will not be applied retroactively to claims already paid. Laws in a small number of states may require the Host Blue to add a surcharge to your ca lculation. If any state laws mandate other liability calculation methods, including a surcharge, Regence BlueShield would then calculate your liability for any covered services according to applicable law. Charges more than the allowed amount are not reimb ursable. For questions regarding the basis for determination of the allowed amount, call UMP Customer Service. Allowed amount, prescription drugs The allowed amount for prescription drugs is based on WSRxS' contractually agreed reimbursement, unless other contractual arrangements or terms apply. All covered prescription drug claims are paid based on this allowed amount. Ambulatory surgery center (ASC) An ambulatory surgery center (ASC) is a health care facility that specializes in providing surgery, pain management, and certain diagnostic services in an outpatient setting. ASC -qualified procedures are typically more complex than those done in a doctor's office but not so complex as to require an overnight stay. Procedures commonly performed in these centers include colonoscopies, endoscopies, cataract surgery, orthopedic, and ENT (ear, nose, and throat) procedures. An ASC may also be known as an outpatient surgery center or same -day surgery center. Annual open enrollment Annual open enrollment is a period of time defined by HCA when a subscriber may change to another health plan offered by the PEBB Program and make certain other account changes for an effective date beginning January 1 of the following year. Appeal See the \"Complaint and appeal procedures\" sec tion for an explanation of appeals and how the process works. For appeals related to PEBB eligibility or enrollment see \"Appeal rights\" in the \"Eligibility and Enrollment\" and in the \"Eligibility and enrollment for a retiree or survivor\" section s for more information. Authorized representative An authorized representative is someone you have designated in writing to communicate with the plan on your behalf. See page 148 for how this works. Balance billing Balance billing is a provider billing you for the difference between the billed amount and the allowed amount. Preferred and participating providers cannot balance bill you for covered services above the allowed amount. See an example of how this works in the \" Sample payments to different provider types \" section . When you receive nonemergency services at a network hospital, network hospital outpatient depar tment, network critical access hospital, or network ambulatory surgical center in Washington State, you pay the network rate and cannot be balance billed regardless of the network status of the provider. For nonemergency services performed at one of these facilities outside of Washington State, you still pay the network rate, but in some states, an out -of-network provider may be allowed to ask you to waive some of your balance billing protections.182 2023UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificate of CoverageAt an out -of-network facility, when you receive emergency se rvices you cannot be balance billed. Birthday rule In some instances, t he birthday rule is used to determine which group health plan will pay first for the dependent children of married, living together and not married, legally separated , or divorced pare nts. This rule looks at only the month and day, not the year, of the parents' birthdays. For example, the plan of a parent born April 14 is primary over the plan of a parent born August 21. If both parents have the same birthday, the plan that has covered either parent the longest is primary. Brand -name drug A brand -name drug is a prescription drug sold under the proprietary name or trade name selected by the manufacturer. Business day Business days are Mondays through Fridays, except for legal holidays obs erved by Washington State. Calendar day A calendar day is any day of the week regardless of whether it is observed as a legal holiday by Washington State. Calendar year A calendar year is January 1 through December 31. Chronic migraine A chronic migraine is having a headache on 15 or more days per month of which eight or more days are a migraine. Clinical review Clinical review is when the plan has a clinical professional review medical records related to treatment to determine if treatment is medically ne cessary. Coinsurance Coinsurance is the percentage of the allowed amount you must pay the provider on claims for which the plan pays less than 100 percent of the allowed amount. This includes most medical services and prescription drugs. Continuation Cover age Continuation Coverage means the temporary continuation of PEBB benefits available to enrollees under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA), the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), or PEB Board polici es. Coordination of benefits (COB) For members covered by more than one group health plan, coordination of benefits (COB) is the method the plan uses to determine which plan pays first, which pays second, and the amount paid by each plan. See description a nd examples in the \"If you have other medical coverage\" section .2023 UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificat e of Coverage 183Copay Copay is a set dollar amount you pay when receiving specific services, treatments, or supplies, such as chiropractic, acupuncture, massage therapy, inpatient hospitalization , or emergency room visits. Cost-share Cost -share means the amount you pay for a service , supply, or prescription drug. This may be a deductible, coinsurance, copay, or amounts not covered by the plan. Custodial care Custodial care is care primarily to assist in activities of daily living, including institutional care primarily to support self -care and provide room and board. Custodial care includes, but is not limited to, help in walking, getting into and out of bed, bathing, dress ing, feeding and preparing special diets, and supervising prescription drugs that are ordinarily self -administered. Deductible, medical The medical deductible is a fixed dollar amount you must meet each calendar year for health care expenses before the pl an starts paying for covered services. You pay the first $250 per member in medical expenses to your providers ($750 maximum if you have a family of three or more on one account). Only expenses covered by the plan apply to your deductible. For example, if you receive LASIK surgery (see exclusion on 114), the plan does not apply this payment to your medical deductible. Some services are exempt from this deductible (see th e \"Summary of benefits\" section ). See the \" What you pay for medical services \" section for details on how the medical deductible works. The medical and prescription drug deductibles are separate: Medical services do not apply to your prescription drug deductible. Pres cription drug purchases do not apply to your medical deductible. See \"Prescription drug deductible\" starting on page 93. Deductible, prescription drugs The prescription drug deductible is a fixed dollar amount you must meet each calendar year for Tier 2 prescription drugs before the plan starts paying benefits for these drugs. Covered insulins are not subject to the deductible. You pay the first $100 per member in prescription drug charges ($300 maximum for a family of three or more on one account). Only expenses for Tier 2 drugs covered by the plan apply to your deductible. For example, if you receive a prescription for a drug for cosmetic purposes (see e xclusion on page 112), the plan does not apply the cost of a noncovered drug to your deductible. What you pay (coinsurance) for Value Tier and Tier 1 drug s does not apply to your prescription drug deductible. The prescription drug and medical deductibles are separate: Prescription drug purchases do not apply to your medical deductible. Medical services do not apply to your prescription drug deductible. See \"Prescription drug deductible\" on page 93. Dependent A dependent is an eligible spouse, state -registered domestic partner, child, or other eligible family member as described in \"Dependent eligibility\" (see the \"Eligibility for subscribers and dependents \" sections on page 152 and 166) that is either covered by or eligible to be covered by the plan under the subscriber's account .184 2023UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificate of CoverageDetoxification Detoxification is a medically supervised treatm ent program for individuals with alcohol or drug intoxication, designed to rid the body of toxic substances and manage withdrawal symptoms. Developmental delay Developmental delay is a significant lag in reaching developmental milestones as expected during infancy and early childhood. The cause may be present at birth or acquired after birth from a disease or disorder of the body, an injury, a disorder of the mind or emotions, or harmful effects of the surrounding environment. Only a physician or other prov ider may diagnose a developmental delay. Durable medical equipment (DME) Durable medical equipment (DME) is: Designed for prolonged use. For a specific therapeutic or clinical purpose, or to assist in the treatment of an injury or illness. Medically necess ary (meeting all plan medical necessity criteria). Primarily and customarily used only for a medical purpose. See page 113 for examples of equipment that is not covered. Effectiveness Effectiveness means the extent to which a specific intervention, procedure, service, level of service, supply, prescription drug, or drug dose may reasonably be expected to produce the intended results and to have expected benefits that outweigh potential harmful effec ts under real -world circumstances. Efficacy Efficacy is the extent to which a specific intervention, procedure, service, supply, or prescription drug produces the desired effect under ideal conditions (in a controlled environment under lab circumstances). Elective contact lenses Elective contact lenses are covered lenses under the frame limit in lieu of coverage for eyeglasses. Emergency See the \"Medical emergency\" definition. Emergency fill Emergency fill is a process where the plan covers a limited amount of a prescription drug on an emergency basis while the plan processes your drug preauthorization request. Employing agency Employing agency means a division, department, or separate agency of state government, including an institution of hig her education; a county, municipality, or other political subdivision; and a tribal government covered by chapter 41.05 RCW .2023 UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificat e of Coverage 185Enrollee Enrollee means a person who meets all eligibility requirements and is enrolled in PEBB benefits, and for whom applicable p remium payments have been made. Excluded pharmacy Excluded pharmacies are pharmacies that have been excluded due to fraud, waste, or abuse . Locate a network pharmacy by visiting the UMP Prescription drug coverage webpage (see Directory for link ). Experimental or investigational Experimental or investigational means any treatment that is not recognized by the plan as conforming to standard medical care for the condit ion, disease, illness, or injury being treated. \"Treatment\" in this setting may include any intervention, therapy, procedure, facility, equipment, drug usage, device, service, supply, intervention, biologic product or drug (prescription or non -prescription ). Experimental and investigational treatments are not covered, even if the treatment is considered medically necessary. The plan will review scientific evidence from well -designed clinical studies found in peer -reviewed medical literature, if available, a nd information obtained from the treating provider regarding the treatment to determine if it is experimental or investigational. A treatment meeting any of the following criteria is considered experimental or investigational: Approval of the treatment or one of its components by one or more government agencies (e.g., FDA) is required but has not been obtained at the time the treatment is requested or administered. The improvement has not been shown to be attainable outside the laboratory or clinical rese arch setting. The scientific evidence does not permit conclusions concerning the effect of the treatment on health outcomes, which include the disease process, injury or illness, length of life, ability to function, and quality of life. The scientific evid ence does not show that the treatment is as beneficial as any established alternatives. The treatment has not been demonstrated to improve net health outcomes. The treatment has scientific evidence to support its use, but not for the specific indication fo r which it is being requested. The treatment is a drug or device that is prescribed for other than its FDA -approved use(s) and is not recognized as \"effective\" for the use for which it is being prescribed. To be considered \"effective\" for other than its FD A-approved use, a prescription drug or device must be so recognized in one of the standard reference compendia or, if not, then in a majority of relevant peer -reviewed medical literature; or by the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services. The treatmen t is considered to be experimental or investigational by U.S. standards. The treatment is drug combination therapy, when the scientific literature only supports the drug's use as monotherapy and not when utilized in combination with other drugs. The treatment is drug monotherapy, when the scientific literature only supports the drug's use when utilized in combination with other drugs. The treatment is not provided by a provider that has demonstrated medical proficiency in the provision of the tre atment. The treatment is only available in the U.S. as part of a clinical trial or research program for the illness or condition being treated.186 2023UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificate of Coverage Although the plan does not pay for items, drugs , devices, or services (including items, drugs, devices, or servi ces provided in a clinical trial) for investigational use, the plan does not deny qualified individuals from participating in approved clinical trials. The terms \"qualified individual\" and \"approved clinical trial\" are defined in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7300gg -8. If a qualified individual is participating in an approved clinical trial, the plan will not deny, limit, or impose additional conditions on the coverage for routine patient costs for items and services furnished in connection with participation in the trial and will not discriminate against the individual on the basis of the individual's participation in such trial. The plan will apply its standard terms and conditions for routine patient costs for items and services furnished in connection with participation in the trial. The treatment is the subject of an on -going phase I or phase II clinical trial or is the research, experimental, study, or investigational arm of an on -going phase III clinical trial. Explanation of Benefits (EOB) An Explanation of Benefits (EO B) is a detailed account of each medical claim processed by the plan, which the plan sends to you to notify you of claim payment or denial. You may also sign in to your Regence account or call UMP Customer Service to request a copy of an EOB (see Directory for link and contact information) . You will need to provide identifying information over the phone. Family Family is defined as all eligible family members (subscriber and dependents) who are enrolled on a single account. Fee schedule A fee schedule is a list of the plan's maximum payment amounts for specific services or supplies. Preferred providers have agreed to accept these fees as payment in fu ll for services to members. See the definition of \"Allowed amount, medical services\" for more details. Formulary A formulary is a list available online that specifies how prescription drugs are covered by the plan. By using this list, you may find out if a prescription drug is covered, if the drug must be ordered through the plan's specialty drug pharmacy, and whether the drug has any limitations (such as needing preauthorization or quantity limits; see the \" Limits on your prescription drug coverage \" secti on). The UMP Preferred Drug List is sometimes called a formulary (see \"The UMP Preferred Drug List\" section for more information). Generic drug A generic drug is a prescription drug with the same active ingredient(s), but not necessarily the same inactive ingredients, as a brand -name drug that is no longer protected by a commercial patent. A generic drug is therapeutically equivalent to the brand -name prescription drug, which means it works like the brand -name drug in dosage, strength, performance, and use . All generic drugs sold in the U.S. must be reviewed and approved by the FDA, and meet the same quality and safety standards as brand -name drugs. Generic equivalent A generic equivalent is a generic prescription drug that has the same active ingredients as its brand - name counterpart. For a generic drug to be considered \"equivalent,\" it has to be approved by the FDA as being interchangeable with that brand -name drug. Under Washington State law, the pharmacist is 2023 UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificat e of Coverage 187required to dispense a generic equivalent in place of a brand -name drug, unless your provider objects. See \"Substitution under Washington State Law\" on page 105 for how this works. Gestational Parent The indi vidual who carries the pregnancy and gives birth. Grievance A grievance is also called a complaint. See the \" Complaint and appeal procedures \" section for details on how these are handled. Habilitative (neurodevelopmental) services Habilitative (neurodevelopmental) services are health care services that help you keep, learn, or improve skills and functioning for daily living. Examples include therapy for a child who isn't walking or talking at the expected age. These services may include physical and occupational therapy, speech - language pathology, and other services for people with disabilities in a variety of inpatient and/or outpatient settings. Health Care Authority (HCA) The Health Care Authority (HCA) is the Washington State agency that administers the Uniform Medical Plan (UMP Classic, UMP Select, UMP CDHP, and the UMP Plus plans: UMP Plus -Puget Sound High Value Network and UMP Plus -UW Medicine Accountable Care Network) , in addition to the following h ealth care programs: Washington Prescription Drug Program, PEBB Program, SEBB Program, Behavioral Health and Recovery, and Apple Health (also known as Medicaid). Health intervention Health intervention is a prescription drug, service, or supply provided t o prevent, diagnose, detect, treat, or palliate the following: disease, illness, injury, genetic or congenital anomaly, pregnancy, or biological or psychological condition that lies outside the range of normal, age -appropriate human variation. A health intervention may also maintain or restore functional ability. A health intervention is defined not only by the intervention itself, but also by the medical condition and patient indications for which it is being applied. A health intervention is new if it is not yet in widespread use for the medical condition and the patient indications being considered. Health outcomes Health outcomes are results that affect health status as measured by the length or quality (primarily as perceived by the member) of a person' s life. High-cost generic drug High -cost generic drug is a generic prescription drug (see the definition of \"Generic drug\") that the plan covers under Tier 2 (see the \"What you pay for prescription drugs\" section ). Home health agency A home health agency i s an agency or organization that: Provides a program of home health care; Practices within the scope of its license as a provider of home health services; and 188 2023UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificate of Coverage Is Medicare -certified, accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organi zations, or a preferred provider. Hospice Hospice is services provided by a state -licensed hospice program in the member's home or in a hospice facility to terminally ill members. Hospice care includes services such as pain care relief for terminally ill members without the intent to cure, and support services for their families. Hospital A hospital is an institution accredited under the Hospital Accreditation Program of the Joint Commission and licensed by the state where it is located . A hospital has a defined course of therapeutic intervention and special programming in a controlled environment. A hospital also offers a degree of security, supervision, and structure. Hospital patients must be medically monitored with 24 -hour medical availability and 24 -hour onsite services as defined in federal guidelines outlining Conditions of Participation for H ospitals . The term hospital does not include a convalescent nursing home or institution (or a part of one) that: Furnishes primarily domiciliary or custodial care. Is operated as a school. Is used principally as a convalescent facility, rest facility, nur sing facility, or facility for the aged. Inpatient copay The inpatient copay is what you pay for inpatient services at a preferred facility, such as a hospital, or skilled mental health, nursing, or substance use disorder facility. Non -Medicare members pa y $200 per day up to $600 maximum per member per calendar year. Medicare members pay $200 per day up to $600 per facility admission. The inpatient copay does not apply to your medical deductible but does apply to the medical out -of-pocket limit. Professio nal charges, such as for physicians or lab work, may be billed separately and are not included in this copay. Inpatient rate The inpatient rate means that the plan pays 100 percent of the allowed amount after you pay your deductible and copay at preferred facilities. The plan pays for professional services, such as provider visits or lab tests, based on the provider's network status during an inpatient stay: Preferred providers: You pay 15 percent of the allowed amount after you meet your medical deductible. The plan pays 85 percent of the allowed amount. Note: For behavioral health professional services, the plan pays 100 percent of the allowed amount. Participating providers: You pay 40 percent of the allowed amount after you meet your medical deductible. The plan pays 60 percent of the allowed amount. Out-of-network providers: You pay 40 percent of the allowed amount after you meet your medical deduct ible. You pay all charges billed to you above the allowed amount (known as balance billing). The plan pays 60 percent of the allowed amount.2023 UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificat e of Coverage 189Inpatient stay An inpatient stay begins when you are admitted to a hospital or other medical facility, and ends wh en you are discharged from that facility. Independent review organization (IRO) An independent review organization (IRO) conducts the independent (or external) review of an appeal. An IRO is a group of medical and benefit experts certified by the Washingt on State Department of Health and not related to the plan, Regence BlueShield, WSRxS, or the Health Care Authority. An IRO is intended to provide unbiased, independent clinical and benefit expertise, as well as evidence -based decision making while ensuring confidentiality. The IRO reviews your appeal to determine if the plan's decision is consistent with state law and the applicable COC. The plan pays the IRO's charges. See \"External review (independent review)\" on page 141. Intensive Outpatient Program Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) is an outpatient program that is licensed as a facility or agency by the appropriate state agency and is provided under the supervisi on of a psychiatrist or psychiatric extender. IOP is intended to provide treatment on an outpatient basis, does not include boarding or housing, and is intended to provide treatment interventions in a structured setting, with patients returning to their ho me environments each day. IOP is a minimum of three hours per day, three days per week. Limited benefit TIP: This definition applies only to those benefits in which it is used in this COC. Other benefits have additional limits related to medical necessity or preauthorization of services (see the \"Limits on plan coverage \" section ). A limited benefit is a benefit that is limited to a certain number of visits or a maximum dollar amount. The limit applies to these benefits even if the provider prescribes additi onal visits and even if the visits are medically necessary. For benefits limited to a certain number of visits, any visits that are applied to your medical deductible also count against your annual visit or dollar limit. In addition, visits that are paid by another health plan that is primary apply to the plan limit. For example, if your primary plan applies your first 12 chiropractor sessions to your medical deductible, you may receive coverage for 12 more sessions in that calendar year, for a total of 24 visits (the visit maximum for chiropractic services). These limits apply per member . Services are counted against a limited benefit according to the type of service, not the provider type. When a provider practicing within the scope of their license prov ides services coded under a limited benefit (e.g., spinal manipulation or physical therapy), those services will be counted against the benefit regardless of the provider type. In addition, if more than one type of limited benefit service is provided durin g a single visit, the services will count against all the limited benefits. For example, if both manipulation and physical therapy codes are billed for a visit, that visit will count against both the spinal and extremity manipulation and physical therapy b enefit limits.190 2023UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificate of CoverageMaintenance care Maintenance care is a health intervention after the member has reached maximum rehabilitation potential or functional level and has shown no significant improvement for one to two weeks, and instruction in the maintenance program has been completed. Maintenance care may a pply to several different services, including, but not limited to, physical therapy, speech therapy, neurodevelopmental therapy, home health care, and skilled nursing care. Medical Medical generally refers to all plan benefits and services other than thos e covered under preventive care and prescription drug benefits (except as the term is used in the eligibility sections of this COC). Medical benefit Medical benefit refers to services subject to the medical deductible, and copay or coinsurance. See the \"What you pay for medical services \" section for a description of how this works. Medical emergency A medical emergency means a medical condition that manifests itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) so that a prudent layperson who has an average knowledge of medicine and health would reasonably expect that not seeking immediate medical tre atment at a n emergency room would result in any one of the following: Places the member's health, or with respect to pregnancy , the health of an unborn child, in serious jeopardy ; Causes serious impairment to bodily functions; or Causes serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part. Medical food Medical food is food administered under the supervision of a provider, intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which there are distinctive nutritional requirements. Medically nec essary or medical necessity ALERT! The provider or member must provide documentation demonstrating medical necessity when requested by the plan, or the plan may deny services as not medically necessary. The plan may not cover some medically necessary servi ces. All benefits or services that are medically necessary are subject to the plan's coverage limitations, exclusions, and provisions of the plan. It is important to review this COC or verify coverage with UMP Customer Service before receiving services. Medically necessary or medical necessity means health care services, supplies, prescription drugs, or interventions that a licensed health care provider recommends and all the following conditions are met: The purpose of the service, supply, intervention, or prescription drug is to prevent, evaluate, treat, or diagnose an illness, injury, disease, or its symptoms.2023 UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificat e of Coverage 191 The level of service, supply, intervention, prescription drug, or prescription drug dose is appropriate considering the potential benefits and harm to the member. The level of service, supply, intervention, prescription drug, or prescription drug dose is known to be effective in improving health outcomes. The level of service, supply, intervention, prescription drug, or prescription drug dose recomme nded for this condition is cost -effective compared to alternative interventions, including no intervention. The service, supply, or intervention is not being recommended for reasons of convenience to the patient or health care provider. For services that t he HTCC has reviewed, and that UMP has implemented, medical necessity is established only when HTCC's coverage conditions are met. The fact that a physician or other provider prescribes, orders, recommends, or approves a service or supply, prescription dru g, or prescription drug dose does not make it medically necessary. The plan may require proof that services, interventions, supplies, or prescription drugs (including court - ordered care) are medically necessary . Depending on the circumstances, such proof m ay be documentation about the member's condition or scientific evidence about the effectiveness of the treatment. The plan will not provide benefits if the required proof is not received, or does not adequately justify the medical necessity of the service , supply, prescription drug, or prescription drug dose. Claims processing may be delayed if proof of medical necessity is required but not adequately provided by the health service provider. The plan uses scientific evidence from peer -reviewed medical lite rature to determine effectiveness for services and interventions not yet in widespread use for the medical condition and member indications being considered. For services that the HTCC has reviewed, and that UMP has implemented, state law requires that UM P use the HTCC's coverage criteria in determining whether the service is medically necessary . When the HTCC determines that a service is not covered, then the service is not covered by the plan . If the HTCC determines that a service is covered, then the HTCC's criteria (if any) determine medical necessity. The HTCC's decisions and related documenta tion are available on the HCA website at hca.wa.gov/ hta. For services, interventions, suppl ies, prescription drugs, or prescription drug doses not related to an HTCC review, the plan first uses scientific evidence, then professional standards, then expert opinion to determine coverage. Scientific evidence consists primarily of controlled clinic al trials that either directly or indirectly demonstrate the effect of the intervention on health outcomes. If controlled clinical trials are not available, observational studies that demonstrate a causal relationship between the intervention and health outcomes may be used. Partially controlled observational studies and uncontrolled clinical series may be suggestive, but do not by themselves demonstrate a causal relationship unless the magnitude of the effect observed exceeds anything that could be explain ed either by the natural history of the medical condition or potential experimental biases. Interventions for which clinical trials have not been conducted because of epidemiological reasons (that is, rare or new diseases or orphan populations) shall be ev aluated based on professional standards of care or expert opinion. A level of service, supply, prescription drug, prescription drug dose, or intervention is considered cost effective if the benefits and harms relative to the costs represent an economically efficient use of 192 2023UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificate of Coverageresources for members with this condition. The plan applies this criterion based on the individual member's medical situation and characteristics. Cost -effective does not always mean the lowest price. Preventive services not covered by th e plan's preventive care benefit will still be covered under the medical benefit or prescription drug benefit if the outlined criteria are met for medical necessity. Member A member is an eligible employee, retiree, former employee or former dependent in Continuation Coverage , survivor, or dependent enrolled in the plan (see also the \"Enrollee\" definition ). Necessary contact lenses Necessary contact lenses are contact lenses that ar e prescribed by your provider for other than elective or cosmetic purposes. Necessary contact lenses are used to treat specific conditions for which contact lenses provide better visual correction.

You may find out which pharmacies are contracted on the UMP Prescription drug coverage webpage or by calling WSRxS Customer Service (see Directory for link and contact information ). Noncovered prescription drugs Noncovered prescription drugs refer to any drug that is onl y covered if the member receiv es an exception from the plan. Some drugs may be medically necessary, yet still are not covered. See the \"Prescription drugs and products UMP does not cover\" section.2023 UMP Classic (PEBB) Certificat e of Coverage 193Noncovered services Noncovered services refers to any medic al service that is not covered by the plan. Some services may be medically necessary, yet still are not covered. See the \"What the plan does not cover\" section . When the HTCC determines that a service is not covered, then the service is not covered by the plan. Nonduplication of benefits Nonduplication of benefits is how UMP coordinates benefits when UMP is your secondary coverage. When another plan is primary (pays first), that plan pays their normal benefit. UMP then pays up to the amount we would have pa id if UMP had been the primary plan. If the primary plan pays as much or more than the normal UMP benefit, UMP pays nothing. UMP does not pay the rest of the allowed amount. See examples on page 124. Non-network pharmacy A non-network pharmacy does not contract with WSRxS. See page 100 for what hap pens if you use a non-network pharmacy to purchase covered prescription drugs. Non-network pharmacies do not include excluded pharmacies (see the definition of \"Excluded pharmacy \").
