W. Godwin1,2,3, R. Debuque2, E. Salimova2and N. A. Rosenthal1,2,4 In dramatic contrast to the poor repair outcomes for humans and rodent models such as mice, salamanders and some sh species are able to completely regenerate heart tissue following tissue injury, at any life stage. This capacity for complete cardiac repair provides a template for understanding the process of regeneration and for developing strategies to improve human cardiac repairoutcomes. Using a cardiac cryo-injury model we show that heart regeneration is dependent on the innate immune system, asmacrophage depletion during early time points post-injury results in regeneration failure. In contrast to the transient extracellular matrix that normally accompanies regeneration, this intervention resulted in a permanent, highly cross-linked extracellular matrix scar derived from alternative broblast activation and lysyl-oxidase enzyme synthesis. The activation of cardiomyocyte proliferation was not affected by macrophage depletion, indicating that cardiomyocyte replacement is an independent feature of the regenerative process, and is not suf cient to prevent brotic progression. These ndings highlight the interplay between macrophages and broblasts as an important component of cardiac regeneration, and the prevention of brosis as a key therapeutic target in the promotion of cardiac repair in mammals. npj Regenerative Medicine (2017)2:22 ; doi:10.1038/s41536-017-0027-y INTRODUCTION The adult mammalian heart has very limited capacity for repair following major insult. Teleost sh and urodele amphibians (i.e., zebra sh and salamanders) are leading models in vertebrate cardiac regeneration that can regenerate their hearts afteramputation of the ventricle apex throughout their lives, 1,2 rebuilding a new compact myocardial layer and undergoing full regeneration of up to 20% of organ mass within 2 months. These species respond to tissue loss without scarring, producing newtissue that restores complete function. 2-4The ability of the adult sh and salamander heart to replace and re-pattern lost cardiac tissue appears be a capricious evolutionary variable; in the non- urodele amphibian adult, cardiac resection leads to little or noregeneration, leaving brosis as the dominant histological reaction to injury. As neonates, mammals such as the mouse recapitulate the dramatic regenerative response of sh and salamander hearts, but this property is lost shortly after birth, 5suggesting that although we retain the necessary genetic programming for cardiac regeneration, other features of the adult mammalian heart intervene to suppress these programs in adulthood. Althoughour own compromised cardiac regenerative capacity has beenattributed largely to the incapacity of adult cardiomyocytes to proliferate after injury and contribute to tissue repair, it is increasingly evident that brosis plays a central role in impeding cardiac tissue replacement in the adult mammalian heart. 6-8 Myocardial infarction (MI), results in necrotic lesions where removal of dead tissue and remodeling in the wound site is notaccompanied by tissue regeneration, leading to heart failure and arrhythmias.9Initial in flammation is critical for clearance of tissue debris, stabilization and strengthening of the myocardial wall andprevention of cardiac rupture, yet persistent in flammation leads to scar formation, functional compromise and ultimately heart failure.6,10,11Thus the orchestration of the in flammatory response and its resolution is a key factor in effective cardiac regeneration that appears to have been lost both in ontogeny (regeneration of neonatal vs. adult mammalian hearts) and phylogeny (regenera- tion of sh and salamander vs. mammalian hearts).12 The immune response to injury is a major factor controlling tissue repair in a range of mammalian wound healing contexts. In the neonatal mouse heart, which fully recovers from injury,5 cardiac regeneration depends on the action of macrophages, as their depletion blocks repair and leads to brosis typical of adult mammalian cardiac damage response.13We have previously documented an early requirement of macrophages for the successful limb regeneration in axolotl, a urodele amphibian,14 which relies on dedifferentiation of mature tissues in an epimorphic process to form a mound of proliferating cells called a blastema. Muscle cells in the axolotl are formed in the new limb almost exclusively from resident muscle progenitor cells Pax7+whereas other urodele species (newts) also use the process of myocyte dedifferentiation.15In the axolotl, cardiac regeneration depends on the proliferation of existing cardiomyocytes to replace the damaged myocardium,16but it is unknown whether this process is dependent on immune signaling. Using the axolotl, we established a cardiac cryo-injury model which induces a necrotic ischemic injury, more accurately Received: 14 March 2017 June 2017 Accepted: 30 June 2017 Published online: 27 July 20171The Jackson laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME 04609, USA;2Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia;3MDI Biological Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME 04609, USA and4National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, UK Correspondence: J.

Godwin (James.godwin@jax.org)www.nature.com/npjregenmed Published in partnership with the Australian Regenerative Medicine Instituterecapitulating many hallmarks of clinical ischemia including cardiomyocyte (CM) death and macrovascular reperfusion9 compared to the more widely studied resection model. Cryo-injured sh and salamander ventricles regenerate without the involvement of compact scar tissue but form a transientcollagenous network that allow activated cardiomyocytes to migrate into and repair the heart muscle wall. 17Here, we show that in the adult axolotl, depleting macrophages in the despite the continued prolifera- tion of activated cardiomyocytes. These results reveal that tissueregeneration in the heart is dependent on an ECM structure andcomposition that is compatible with cardiac muscle replacement, and that macrophages may play a critical role in preventing precocious ECM maturation. RESULTS Necrotic cryo-injuries are regenerated in axolotlsDamage to the heart ventricle by puncture or resection in both newt and axolotl salamanders results in transient ECM synthesis and functional replacement of missing or damaged cardiomyo- cytes, epicardium, endothelium and connective tissue cells. 16,18,19 In an alternate approach similar to that developed in mice and zebra sh9,17,20we used a liquid nitrogen cooled gold probe to reproducibly induce targeted tissue damage on the ventricle wall in order to monitor healing and repair over the time course of regeneration (Fig.1a, b). The cryo-lesion resulted in tissue damage and necrosis (Fig. 1c), requiring debridement and cell replace- ment. Robust in ltration of nucleated cells was consistent with invasion of in flammatory leukocytes (Fig. 1d). Cryo-injuries were completely repaired by 60 -90 days (Fig. 1e-g)similar to that reported for ventricular resection.16 Regeneration relies on cardiomyocyte proliferation in a temporal sequence of activation Heart regeneration in the salamander involves the activation of cardiomyocyte proliferation. We assessed the time-course forproliferation in the cryo-injured heart by assessing in both cardiomyocytes (Nkx2.5+ve) vs. non-cardiomyocyte (Nkx2.5 ve) populations in each week following cardiac cryo-injury (Fig. 1h-j). A distinct sequence for proliferation was observed, starting with epicardial activation and a burst of proliferation in the valve region in week 1 (Fig. 1k). As seen in sh cardiac injury response,21epicardial proliferation was observed globally and not limited to the injury site. In week 2, cardiomyocyte proliferation was increased and mainly restricted to the border zone of the injury site, accompanied by continued cell proliferation in the epicardium. In week 3, cardiomyoyte proliferation peaked in a dense layer around the injury border zone with a scattering of cardiomyocyte proliferation extending into remote regions of the ventricle. Proliferation continued to decline until regeneration was complete (Fig. 1j). Macrophage depletion prior to cardiac cryo-injury results in impaired cardiac function and poor survival To test the dependence of adult axolotl heart regeneration on macrophage function we employed a clodronate liposome (Clo-Lipo) macrophage depletion regimen that eliminates macro- phages from all major organs after three i.v. injections over 4 days.14This procedure depletes resident macrophages from liver and spleen due to access via the fenestrated vasculature. Although the depletion of cardiac resident macrophages may not be absolute, the enhanced trabeculation of the salamander heart, relative to the mouse, does provide enhanced access ofclodornate liposomes to resident macrophages. Axolotl hearts were cryo-injured during a Clo-Lipo macrophage-depleted win-dow of around 7 -10 before from myelopoiesis (Fig. 2a, Supp. Fig. 1A). Cryo-lesions were located by the absence of cardiac troponin T within the ventricle,and reduction in macrophage accumulation was identi ed key ECM proteins (Tenascin C, Collagen-I and Fibronectin) within the compared the buffered loadedliposome (PBS-Lipo) control animals (Fig.2c, The effect of cryo-injuring the axolotl heart in the absence of macrophages was dramatic, with progressive scarring occurring inmacrophage depleted hearts evident at 25, 50, and 90-days post- injury (Fig. 3a), accompanied by a change in ventricular function assessed by ultrasound analysis (Fig.3b). Fractional Area Change (FAC) was used as a functional parameter. %FAC was signi cantly reduced at 14 days relative to uninjured in both PBS injected animals and Clo-Lipo treated animals (Fig. 3c). The PBS-Lipo treated animals showed functional recovery by 45 days whereasClo-Lipo treated animals showed reduction in functional improve-ment at 45-days relative to uninjured and PBS injected animals.Similar results were obtained using independent LV(LeftVentricu- lar)-trace mode that allows for volumetric calculations (e.g., %EF and stroke volume) calculations (Data not shown). Long-termanimal survival was also severely impacted in Clo-Lipo treatedanimals despite restoration of macrophage function around 10-days post-injury (Fig.3d). This mortality was not observed in limb regeneration model using the same Clo-Lipo regimen. 14Macro- phage depletion placed the short-term survival at risk frominfection post injury, however the impacts on long-term survivalwere likely related to heart failure as no signs of infection were observed in these animals. Macrophage depletion results in disruption of the regeneration program by induction of broblast activation and alternative ECM prole To determine the processes leading to the dramatic scar tissue accumulation and lack of collagen remodeling back to normal tissue in macrophage-depleted hearts, we rst characterized ECM components that were up-regulated following cryo-injury in bothPBS-Lipo control animals and macrophage depleted Clo-Lipoanimals. The region of cryo-injury was determined by thedepletion of cardiac troponin T staining and sarcomeric myosin in injured cardiomyocytes (see Fig. 2b). Using this landmark, we assessed that bronectin was speci cally up-regulated within the lesion site in control animals but a muted response is observed inmacrophage depleted animals (Fig. 2d), accompanied by robust induction of Alpha-Smooth Muscle Actin ( SMA) positive cells lesion 4a Supp. Fig. 1A). In PBS-Lipo control animals ( SMA) positive cells were con ned to the epithelial region and were absent within the lesion. Discoidin domainreceptor 2 (DDR2) positive cells were in Clo-Lipo treated animals (Fig.4b, Supp. Fig. 1A). These represent highly conserved and speci c markers for activated subsets of broblasts associated with the promotion of collagen synthesis and brosis. 23Macrophage depletion also produced changes in collagen deposition and arrangement as measured by picosirius red and polarized light, consistent with the limb regeneration model (Fig.4c). Macrophages play an important role in regulating new blood vessel and lymphatic vessel growth in many species. To determinewhether the lack of macrophages during the early phase of injuryaffected vessel sprouting at 14 days post injury, we stained von Wilebrand factor (vWF) positive endothelial cells to reveal blood vessel sprouting Fig. 5a-b)maintained at a low level within the cryo-lesion wound margins of Clo-Lipo animals, but vessel densityHeart regeneration depends on macrophages JW Godwin et al. 2 npj Regenerative Medicine (2017) 22 Published in partnership with the Australian Regenerative Medicine Institutewas severely reduced relative to PBS-Lipo treated animals (Supp. Fig.1B). Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is a major driver of heart repair and some isoforms are produced by macrophages.24 Expression of the IGF-1 ligand was weakly maintained in theepicardium but was noticeably absent in the remainder of the lesion in macrophage-depleted animals (Fig. 5c, Supp. Fig. IGF1 Receptor was upregulated in cardiomyo- cytes at the wound margin in both macrophage-depleted and control hearts (Fig. 5c, Supp. Fig. 1B), indicating that the failure in Fig. 1 Proliferation of cardiomyocytes during cardiac regeneration post cryo-injury. aA commercial liquid nitrogen cooled cryo-gun was used to generate a cryo-lesion at the apex of the heart. bDifferent gold tip attachments allowed matching to animal size. cA necrotic lesion was produced with edema still present at 6-days post injury (Dpi). dThe lesion was identi ed by a robust in flammatory in ltrate with visible peripheral nuclei (DAPI) at 6 dpi.

Axolotl cardiomyocyte proliferation is maintained despite regenerative failure The lack of suf cient cardiomyocyte proliferation in mammals is generally considered to be a major obstacle to regeneration. To determine whether macrophage depletion directly affects CMreplenishment by potentially limiting growth factors or cytokinestimulation, we measured CM proliferation at 7 and 14-days post- injury in macrophage-depleted axolotl staining of NKx2.5+ cardiomyocytes(Supp. Fig. 2). These time-points span the period before and during the initial wave of macrophage replenishment. We foundno signi cant difference in CM proliferation at these time points (Fig. 5d). The activation of CM proliferation in the absence of macrophages indicates that CM de ciency is not the cause of regenerative failure in macrophage-depleted cryo-injuredanimals.

Transforming growth factor beta (TGF ) expression was elevated in macrophage-depleted the major macrophage-dependent MMP, while expression from neutrophils may compensate for other MMPs. The molecular pathways responsible for the highly cross-linked ECM phenotype likelyinclude a gene group belonging to the Lysl-oxidase enzyme family (LOX) involved in collagen crosslinking and tissue maturation, which showed high dysregulation across several family members,while other pathways that were not affected included Transglu- taminase 2 involved in brosis, and Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 3 Family Member A2 involved in retinoic acid synthesis (Fig. 6). DISCUSSION This study highlights the central role of brotic pathways in limiting ef cient cardiac repair, and demonstrates an immediate requirement for macrophages in regeneration of adult cardiactissue, as their ablation at early time-points has lasting effects on the outcome of the cardiac injury response: progressive brosis results in defective cardiac regeneration and abrogates functional recovery.

Scale bar =500MHeart regeneration depends on macrophages JW Godwin et al. 5 Published in partnership with the Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute npj Regenerative Medicine (2017) 22indicates that macrophages are immediately required to control broblast differentiation. Whereas early macrophage depletion could be expected to affect viability and recovery from surgerydue to associated risk of infection, animals surviving this initial period are at increased risk at much later time points, coinciding with progressive brosis leading to terminal heart failure. Theseresults are reminiscent of mammalian MI injury where dilation and brotic progression ultimately destroys heart function,25and are consistent with a model inducing unresolved in flammation in the regenerating amphibian limb, where cellular dedifferentiation and reprogramming still occur locally, but the tissue interactions andsignaling required for limb patterning cannot be established, leading to regenerative failure.26 In the hearts of macrophage-depleted cryo-injured axolotls, initiation of CM proliferation was unaffected at 7 and 14-days post-injury. The fact that the CM response was largely intact in hearts damaged by the absence of macrophages indicates that CM proliferation is not the limiting step in axolotl heart regeneration.Cardiomyocytes at the lesion site functionally responded to injuryby upregulating IGF1R at the borderzone and although IGF-1 expression was reduced in clodronate-induced cryo-lesions, it was partially maintained in the epicardium, a potent source of growthfactor signaling in the zebra sh. 27It is therefore possible that epicardially derived growth factors are suf cient to maintain CM proliferation in the cro-injured axolotl heart. Macrophages play an essential role in many injury contexts by supporting angiogenesis through expression of Vascular endothleial growth factor A.28,29We observed in vWF+ endothelial populations between macrophage depletedand control cryo-lesions. This supports a role for macrophage-dependent angiogenesis although it is not known if the new blood vessel growth arises from sprouting or from epicardial derived endothelial progenitors in this model. 30At 10 days after clodronate treatment, macrophage populations are largelyrestored in axolotls, at which point any pro-angiogenic functions are likely impacted by rigid brotic ECM associated with early macrophage depletion. New blood vessel growth is likely toimpact the speed of regeneration in axolotls however the thin trabeculated (non-compacted) structure of the myocardium likely allows some access of oxygenated blood to the injured tissue.Therefore is is possible that angiogenisis may not be an absoluterequirement for allowing the regeneration of an amphibian heart. Future studies should be aimed at testing the requirement for neoangiogenesis in a non- brotic alternative model. The lack of macrophages in early cryo-lesions does not result in cardiac rupture but alters the ECM landscape, presumably through the activation state of attending connective tissue cells. The progressive nature of brosis that appears with cryo-lesions in clodronate-treated animals presumably stems from the early activation of myo broblasts within the wound and the down- stream accumulation of collagen deposition. The differentiation ofbroblasts and other precursor cells into myo broblast popula- tions is a major driver of the brotic response in humans and other mammals. 31-33Normal regeneration activates myo broblast conversion in the epicardium depletion of macrophagesresults in broblast activation (alpha SMA+ cells) not normally found within the lesioned site. This observation gives weight to the notion that wound macrophages act as a negative regulator of broblast differentiation. In this study it is unclear the exact origin Fig. 4 Macrophage depleted animals feature enhanced broblast differentiation and collagen maturation. aAlpha smooth muscle actin ( SMA) positive myo broblasts populated the cryo-lesion in Clo-Lipo treated animals where SMA + cells were restricted to the epicardium in PBS-Lipo control lesioned animals at 7 dpi. bDiscoidin Domain Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 2 (DDR2) expression was up-regulated in Clo-Lipo treated animals 7 dpi at different sites at along the wound margin. cDissected 14 dpi cryo-injured whole mounted hearts imaged under a polarizing lens at maximum contrast.

Scale bar =100MHeart regeneration depends on macrophages JW Godwin et al. 6 npj Regenerative Medicine (2017) 22 Published in partnership with the Australian Regenerative Medicine Instituteof the participating macrophages and if regulatory function is restrictied to a particular subpopulation. In mammals, myo bro- blasts are derived from a range of progenitors.34,35It is not known if these cell types can act as a source of myo broblasts in salamander tissues or how the lack of macrophages may enhance broblast differentiation. Real time PCR (RT-PCR), suggests that at least a portion of broblasts in these wounds have altered gene expression. DDR2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase implicated in the regulation of growth, migration, cellmorphology, and differentiation and remodeling of the ECM by controlling matrix metalloproteinases.23In mammals, DDR2 is a marker of mesenchymal cells36and is restricted to cardiac broblasts in the adult heart.37In the mouse, DDR2 expression has been linked with cardiac brosis through multiple pathways,23,38 as the extracellular discoidin domain of DDR2 binds with high afnity to immobilized collagen type I.39It is therefore likely that DDR2 is an evolutionarily conserved marker for alternativelyactivated broblasts in the salamander heart. Mesenchymal cells are endowed with the remarkable ability to respond to environ- mental signals triggered by injury or infection and phenotypic Fig. 5 Blood vessel density and IGF signaling in macrophage depleted animals is altered in Clo-Lipo animals where cardiomyocyte proliferation appears unchanged. aEndothelial cell staining using von Wilebrand Factor (vWF) demonstrated a reduced vascular network in Clo-Lipo at 14 dpi. bhigher magni cation of vWF staining at wound margin showed reduction in blood vessel outgrowth. cInsulin- like Growth Factor (IGF-1) ligand expression was downregulated in Clo-Lipo injured hearts at 14 dpi with weak epicardial expressionmaintained. Conversely, IGF-1-Receptor expression was upregulated speci cally in cardiomyocytes (CMs) at the wound margin and maintained in Clo-Lipo treated animals. dCM proliferation was measured using PCNA+ Nkx2.5+ cells on 7 and 15 dpi hearts and no signi cant difference was detected. CM proliferation measured using at least three sections per animal and three animals per time-point.

MMPs have both inhibitory and stimulatory roles inbrosis that vary by tissue and wound healing phase. 45In vitro, MMP3 activates -catenin transition.46Reduced in macrophage- Fig. 6 Gene expression analysis of macrophage depleted hearts post cryo-injury identi es molecular targets regulating ECM regulation during regeneration.

(see Methods section for statistics)Heart regeneration depends on macrophages JW Godwin et al. 8 npj Regenerative Medicine (2017) 22 Published in partnership with the Australian Regenerative Medicine Institutedepleted cryo injured hearts may therefore affect EMT, abrogating -catenin signaling.47MMP2 has been implicated in cardiac brosis, associated with cardiac broblasts and promotes brosis at both early injury and late resolution stages in liver injury where in lung it may play an anti-brotic role.44 TGFis a potent activator of myo broblast induction in many species and a major regulator of brosis in many contexts including the heart.49TGFis essential for limb regeneration in the salamander50and it is likely that strict temporal expression is required to maintain functional regeneration circuits. The upre-gulation of cardiac TGF in the absence of macrophages is in agreement with results obtained previously in the limb regenera- tion model (Godwin et al ., PNAS 2014). The source of increased TGFproduction in the absence of macrophages is yet to be determined but highlights a role for macrophage-speci c cytokine regulation of TGF expression in salamander regeneration. Our analysis uncovered a potential role for the LOX family of enzymes in the precocious maturation of the transient regen-erative ECM, as several members of the LOX enzyme family were dysregulated in cardiac cryo-lesions in macrophage-depleted animals. LOX enzymes play an important role in the maturationof ECM proteins and correct assembly of tissue architecture,forming cross links between ECM proteins that stabilize ECM tissues during normal homeostasis. activation axolotl heart post-cryo-injury suggests that macrophage signaling is required to prevent early maturation of the transientECM required for regeneration. LOXL1 regulates collagen cross-linking and total collagen levels in angiotensin II-induced hypertension in rodents, 52has been associated with renal brosis53When overexpressed, it induces cardiac hypertrophy in mice.54LOX enzymes have also been implicated in activation of TGF1 signaling from the latent complex.55LOXs also contribute signi cantly to the detrimental effects of cardiac remodeling in mice following MI56and as such may represent a common pathway of brotic disruption of repair in a range of evolutionarily distinct species, Inhibition of LOX signaling may therefore be an important therapeutic avenue for limiting brosis. Notably, transglutaminase pathways were unaffected by macrophagedepletion. Transglutaminase is reported to promote tissue brosis through cross-linking extracellular collagen and bronectin, making them more resistant to breakdown57along with multiple other functions that may promote brosis.58The lack of transglutaminase activation may be another key feature of effective cardiac regeneration. Previous studies of cardiac repair in mouse models have been focused on driving cardiomyocyte proliferation to improve cardiacregeneration (reviewed in refs. 59-61) In the salamander CM proliferation is necessary but not suf cient to drive effective regeneration, suggesting that efforts should be refocused onunderstanding the dominant broblast signals regulating repair. The excessive activation of broblasts have been implicated as major determinants of maladaptive repair in a range ofmammalian contexts 41and the injury induced changes in mesenchymal cell activation appears evolutionarily conserved. Identifying the mechanism by which macrophage- broblast interactions repress brotic activation in the salamander heart may lead to new molecular targets useful in promoting cardiacregeneration in humans.

Cryo injury procedure Animals were anesthetized in 0.05 -0.1% MS-222 (ethyl 3-aminobenzoate in a supine positon. Skin was cleaned withchlorohexidine and the heart accessed by keyhole surgery. Brie fly, a small incision was made on the skin and thoracic muscle. Using sterile ne forceps and iredectomy scissors, the pericardial sac was opened to revealthe beating heart. A commercial gold probe (Brymill AC-3 with differentsized tip attachments) was cooled by squeezing the lever allowing liquidnitrogen to cool the tip of the apparatus. The tip of the probe was placedon the tip of the ventricle for 5 s and then flushed with sterile saline with 1x penicillin/streptomycin to release the probe. A white ring of damagedtissue was observed that formed the new cryo-lesion. Probe size wasadjusted and hold time optimized for animal size to create a lesion 1/3 ofthe ventricle, positioned at the tip. The pericardial sac was either sealedwith vetbond (3 M) or ethilon silk sutures (for animals over 5 cm).

For histology, samples were xed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.7 \u00d7 PBS at 4 \u00b0C, then rinsed,dehydrated, embedded in paraf n and sectioned at a thickness of 14 m. Before staining, slides were de-paraf nized through three baths of xylene for 5 min each. Slides were then rehydrated in a graded series of 100, 90,70, and 50% ethanol and then nally hydrated in distilled water for 5 min each. Sections were washed and counterstained with DAPI (Sigma) andmounted in Vectamount fluorescent mounting medium (Vector labs) or Mowbiol. on a Nikon C1, Leica SP8or Zeiss Axiovert 200 M Imarissoftware (Bitplane). Quantitation of immuno fluorescence was done blinded using a Fiji (image J software). Cytochemistry Reagents for Acid Fuchsin Orange G and Picosirius red staining werepurchased from sigma and performed according to standard procedures(ihcworld.com). Picosirius red analysis was performed on a Leica DM4500using a polarized lter set at maximal contrast. Antibodies The following antibodies were speci c application. All other secondary antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen (highly cross absorbed). RT-PCR gene expression analysis RNA was isolated from harvested tissue using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen).Following isolation, RNA was further puri ed using the Zymopure RNA isolation kit with on column DNA digestion. RNA quality was assessed byspectrophotometry using a NanoDrop ND-1000 (NanoDrop, Wilmington,USA). Reverse transcription was performed using the VILOcDNA synthesis kit (Life technologies). Quantitative PCR assays wereperformed using LightCycler 480 SYBR green (Roche) and analyzed using aLC480 Thermal Cycler instrument (Roche). Gene expression levels werecalculated using the 2 Ct and were normalized by using the geometric mean of at least three housekeeping (normalizer) genes. Experiments wereperformed at least three times and from three biological replicates. Primersequences used in RT-PCR gene expression analysis are listed in Table S1. Statistical analysis Data were shown throughout as mean values \u00b1 s.e.m. Analyses of signicant differences between means were performed using two-tailed Student 's t-tests or 2-way ANOVA.
