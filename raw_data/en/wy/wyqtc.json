As a psychologist, I can tell when people's religious beliefs and lifestyles are enabling them to enjoy life, be enjoyable to others, and leave the world a better place each day. No matter what a person's religious faith or denomination, most would agree this is healthy. For defining sick and healthy religious or spiritual faith, an excellent book was written some years ago by a counselor Steve Arterburn and a pastor Jack Felton, called Toxic Faith. I really like their final chapter, \"Seventeen Characteristics of Healthy Faith\". Here they are: 16. Able to Embrace our Humanity: we acknowledge our capacity to sin, and make mistakes. We forgive others to appreciate our own forgiveness, by God, by ourselves, and by trusted other people. If you are called to love God and others, you have to take care of the caretaker, the one who does the loving, and that's you. In many ways, if you don't take care of yourself, no one else can, and then you can't take very good care of others either. Next time I'm going to wander into the country of sacred cows. I'll take a meddling look at unhealthy faith, and in particular, at certain toxic religious experiences, beliefs and lifestyles. You'll likely agree with me and with Toxic Faith that these are sick, but I don't think you'll have much trouble coming up with lots of examples from the people you've known and seen, and probably even one or two within yourself! Your \"faith\" is your own spiritual or religious beliefs, and the lifestyle that grows out of those beliefs. This column is written so that readers can examine their own religious beliefs and practices to see where their faith might be creating problems in their own or others' lives. My previous column on healthy faith gave the thoughts of Steve Arterburn and Jack Felton in their book Toxic Faith, and I'll do the same again today. Toxic faith will cause ongoing problems for ourselves and others. I have reworded a few of Arterburn and Felton's toxic beliefs, left some out, and added the last three from my own experience. Beware if you believe the following: Conditional Love: God's love and favor depend on our behavior. Instant Peace: when tragedy strikes, real believers feel nothing but peace. Guaranteed Healing: if our faith is real, God will always heal whoever we pray for. Blameless Ministers: all ordained ministers can and should be trusted. Monetary Rewards: material prosperity is given to those with true faith. Investment Tithing: the more money we give to God, the more money God gives to us. Salvation by Works: we can work our way into Heaven. Spiteful God: life's problems are God's punishments for our sins. Slavery of the Faithful: we must not stop meeting others' needs. Irrational Surrender: I must always submit to authority. Religious Inequality: God uses only spiritual giants. Passivity: true faith waits for God to help with problems, and does nothing until then. Biblical Exclusivity: the Bible is the only source for truth. Heavenly Matchmaking: God will find a mate perfect for me. Na\u00efve optimism: everything that happens to us is good. Bullet-proof Faith: our beliefs will protect us from problems and pain. Impersonal God: God is too big to care about us. Divinely Ordained Happiness: more than anything else, God wants us to be happy. Attaining Perfection: we can become God. Privileged Class: God wants his followers to dominate, exploit, or pretty much ignore nonbelievers. Political Favoritism: God favors one political nation or party above all others. Na\u00efve New Age: we should ignore sin and evil like God does, because they aren't real. Enough about beliefs\u2014how about the way you live? Arterburn and Felton list some religiously inspired lifestyles they find unhealthy. Again, this is my doctored list: In closing I remind you that this column is written to help you find the toxic aspects of your own spiritual beliefs and lifestyle. If you believe or practice any of the things above, you need to talk with your pastor about it. If your pastor doesn't see a problem with it, you need to find yourself another church. And finally, as you have read this, if you have been finding yourself using these lists to judge only other people instead of yourself, your faith is developing one of the most toxic traits of all\u2014the inability to smell your own spiritual stink.
