These nine healing crystals can naturally boost energy levels and vitality!", "sitename": "Angel Grotto", "date": "2019-11-19", "cleaned_text": "Low energy can affect every aspect of your life. These nine healing crystals boost energy levels, so you feel happier, less stressed and more productive. Having lots of energy is the key to a happy and successful life. It's impossible to achieve your goals, remain productive, or even enjoy social interactions when you're feeling drained. By invigorating your energy fields, healing crystals can boost your energy levels. This raises your mood, stimulates life-energy (chi) and promotes self-confidence. Here are nine of my favourite crystals for energy. Disclaimer: I'm not a medical professional, so if you're experiencing extended periods of low mood or motivation please seek medical advice. Crystals should only be used as a compliment to regular medical care. Which are the Best Crystals for Energy? 1. Ruby (Stone of Nobility) Colour: Red Chakra: Heart, Root Origin: Mexico, Madagascar, India, Kenya, Sri Lanka, Russia, Cambodia, Thailand, Burma Ruby is an energising crystal that's great for overcoming lethargy and exhaustion. Placing it over your Heart or Root Chakra can clear emotional blockages, due to its red colour. These blockages are draining, so removing them gives a quick boost. This crystal also stimulates life-force energy (chi) and grounds you to Earth. So, it's no wonder you'll feel an increase in vitality when ruby is in your energy field. 2. Citrine (The Lucky Merchant's Gemstone) Colour: Yellow, Ranging from Pale to Honey or Even Brown Chakra: Solar Plexus, Crown Origin: Brazil, France, Madagascar, Russia, UK, USA Citrine is one of the best energy-boosting crystals. Its sunny energy restores balance to the Solar Plexus, which is the power Chakra in the body. When this Energy Centre is blocked or out of balance, you may feel lethargic or tired. Keep this happy stone near you when your energy is flagging. Note: Most citrine is actually heat-treated Amethyst, as natural citrine is rare (and hence expensive). This changes its metaphysical properties, so be sure to find a reliable supplier if you want genuine citrine. 3. Sunstone (Stone of Leadership) Colour: Yellow, Orange, Red-Brown Chakra: Solar Plexus, Sacral Origin: USA, Norway, Canada, Greece, India, Russia Sunstone is one of my personal favourites for boosting energy levels. With its yang energy, it carries the regenerative qualities of the sun and shines positivity on all endeavours. If other people's negative or over-demanding energy is draining, let sunstone release you from their influence. You can then develop your true sense of self with joy and happiness. When you're feeling glum or going through a stressful period, sunstone will brighten your day and rejuvenate your physical body. It'll give you that extra boost of energy to stay positive. 4. Garnet (Stone of Health and Commitment) Colour: Deep Red, Pink, Orange/Brown, Clear Green Chakra: Root (Other Chakras Dependant on the Colour) Origin: Worldwide Garnet supports a healthy flow of chi through your body. This is essential for feeling energised and happy. With its power to break down blockages within your Root Chakra, garnet will also stimulate feelings of self-worth. It'll draw in restorative energy when you need it and boost your passion for life, even during times of stress. As well as promoting physical energy, garnet injects a new enthusiasm into business and friendships. 5. Blue Apatite (Stone of Inspiration and Manifestation) Colour: Light, Bright or Dark Blue Chakra: Throat, Third Eye Origin: Mexico, Russia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Norway, Africa, Sri Lanka, USA, Madagascar If you need a crystal to get you moving again, blue apatite is a great choice. It boosts under-activity and dissolves apathy through balancing the yin-yang energy. It also stimulates the kundalini energy. As well as mobilising energy reserves, blue apatite will support a healthy eating plan. This is essential for maintaining vitality and vigour. 6. Pyrite (Fool's Gold) Colour: Yellow/Gold Chakra: Solar Plexus Origin: Australia, South Africa, Spain, Japan, Peru, Russia, Greece, Sweden, Czech Republic, UK, North America Pyrite gets its name from the Greek word pyr, meaning fire. So, it isn't surprising this mineral can bring fire's powerful energy into your life. The cubic structure of pyrite acts like an energetic shield that blocks negative forces from sapping your energy. It also prevents energy leaks from your aura. You'll feel less tired when near pyrite, as this mineral fires up enthusiasm to face life's challenges. As well as promoting energy, it's believed that pyrite increases oxygen supply in your blood. This could ease feelings of exhaustion. 7. Bloodstone (Stone of Courage and Bravery) Colour: Green with Flecks of Red Chakra: Root, Sacral, Solar Plexus, Heart Origin: Brazil, China, Czech Republic, Australia, India, Russia Bloodstone connects to the Root Chakra. It improves resilience and allows you to accept change, leading to greater energy when dealing with emotional situations. It also protects you from bullying or negativity. If you feel like other people are dragging you down, bloodstone is one of the best energising crystals. Note: Bloodstone is also known as heliotrope. 8. Carnelian (Stone of Motivation and Endurance) Colour: Orange, Red Chakra: Sacral, Root Origin: India, Romania, USA, Peru, Britain, Czech Republic, Iceland, Slovakia, Brazil Carnelian is another of my favourite energy crystals. It awakens passion and vitality, allowing you to move towards your goals more effectively. This crystal's sunset hues can also release suppressed emotions that are affecting your mood. It does this by opening and clearing the Sacral Chakra. Carnelian is also my [favourite crystal for boosting motivation](https://angelgrotto.com/crystals-stones/motivation/). Tip for Using Carnelian: Wear carnelian on a belt buckle to release suppressed emotions and awaken creative passions. 9. Poppy Jasper Colour: Mottled Red Chakra: Root Origin: China, USA, South Africa By resonating with the Root Chakra, Poppy Jasper's energising vibration promotes vitality and passion. It's great when you need a boost in motivation after a period of sluggishness. Poppy Jasper is also a wonderful crystal to use when recovering from illness. The flower-like patterns can increase your energy levels and help you re-establish a positive routine. BONUS CRYSTAL: Turquoise (Stone of Communication) As a Gemstone of Communication, turquoise helps when you're feeling tired from stressful situations or arguments. Energy vampires often use arguments to cause doubt and drain your confidence. The healing energy of this crystal teaches you to appreciate other people's views, while still valuing your true essence. Turquoise also encourages you to speak honestly and from the heart. This instantly gives your energy a huge boost, as you take back control of your personal power. Other Crystal Healing Tips for Boosted Energy Levels The unique vibrations of healing crystals can boost your energy levels and reduce negative energy. Here are a few ways you can use them: - Keep energy-boosting crystals with you throughout the day. Jewellery is a fabulous way to do this, but you can also carry gemstones in your pockets. - Sleep is important, but the highly energetic crystals in this article may keep you awake - especially if placed close to your bed. Take a look at [my article about crystals for sleeping problems](https://angelgrotto.com/crystals-stones/sleep/)for better alternatives. - Elixirs are a wonderful way to keep yourself hydrated with the energising power of crystals. Be careful which crystal you choose, however, as not all are suitable for elixirs. Crystal healing isn't the only way to feel more energetic. Studies have shown that 2-3 hours of cardiovascular exercise each week can help you feel less stressed and have more energy. Eating well, staying hydrated, and getting lots of sleep are also essential. Tip: The crystals above are brilliant for increasing energy - but what if you want protection from negative energies? Take a look at [my protection stones page](https://angelgrotto.com/crystals-stones/protection/). Which Angels are Associated With Positive Energy? Angels open our hearts and raise our vibration.
