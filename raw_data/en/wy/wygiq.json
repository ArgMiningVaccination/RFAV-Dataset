In pretext to these guidelines these health car e facilities includes District Hospitals, Sub Divisional Hospitals, Community Health Centres, Primary Health Centres and Sub centres \"Management\" includes all steps required to ensure that bio - medical waste is managed in such a manner as to protect health and environment against any adverse effects due to handling of such waste; \"Occupier\" means a person having administrative control over the institution and the premises generating bio -medical waste, which includes a hospital, nursing home, clinic, dispens ary, veterinary institution, animal house, pathological laboratory, blood bank, health care facility and clinical establishment, irrespective of their system of medicine and by whatever name they are called; Guidelines for Management of Healthcare Waste as per Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016 2 \"Operator of a common bio -medical waste treatmen t facility\" means a person who owns or controls a Common Bio -medical Waste Treatment Facility ( CBWTF ) for the collection, reception, storage, transport, treatment, disposal or any other form of handling of bio -medical waste. \"Prescribed authority\" mean the State Pollution Control Board in respect of State and Pollution Control Committee in respect of Union Territory. \"Point of Generation\" means the location where wastes initially generate, accumulate and is under the control of the operator of the waste -generating process. \"Storage\" means the holding of bio medical waste for a temporary period at the end of which the bio -medical waste is treated or disposed. \"Treatment\" means any method, technique, or process, including neutralization, designed to change the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics or composition of any hazardous waste 1.2 Classification of Healthcare Waste Health Care Facilities (HCFs) are primarily responsible for management of the healthcare waste generated within the facilities, including activities undertaken by them in the community. The health care facilities, while generating the waste are responsible for segregation, collection, in -house transportation, pre -treatment of waste and storage of waste, before such waste is collec ted by Common Bio -medical Waste Treatment Facility (CBWTF) Operator. Thus, for proper management of the waste in the healthcare facilities the technical requirements of waste handling are needed to be understood and practiced by each category of the staff in accorda nce with the BMWM Rules, 2016. Waste generated from the health care facility is classified as: Bio Medical Waste General Waste Other Wastes Figure 1 Percentage -wise classification of waste generated from the Health Care Facility a) Bio Medical Waste Bio-medical waste means any waste, which is generated during the diagnosis, treatment or immunization of human beings or animals or research activities pertaining thereto or in the production or testing of biological or in health camps. Bio-Medical waste includes all the waste generated from the Health Care Facility which can have any adverse effect to the health of a person or to the environment in general if not disposed properly. All such waste which can adversely harm the envi ronment or health of a person is considered as infectious and such waste has to be managed as per BMWM Rules, 2016. 15% 85%Health Care Waste Bio Medical Waste General Waste Guidelines for Management of Healthcare Waste as per Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016 3 The quantity of such waste is around 10% to 15% of total waste generated from the Health Care Facility. This waste consists of the materials which ha ve been in contact with the patient's blood, secretions, infected parts, biological liquids such as chemicals, medical supplies, medicines, lab discharge, sharps metallic and glassware, plastics etc. Bio Medical Waste Management Rules, 2016 categorises the bio-medical waste generated from the health care facility into four categories based on the segregation pathway and colour code. Various types of bio medical waste are further assigned to each one of the categories , as detailed below: 1. Yellow C ategory 2. Red Category 3. White Category 4. Blue Category These categories are further divided as per the type of waste under each category as follows: Table 1: Categories of Biomedical Waste CATEGORY TYPE OF WASTE YELLOW Human Anatomical Waste Human tissues, organs, body parts and fetus below the viability period (as per the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act 1971, amended from time to time). Animal Anatomical Waste Experimental animal carcasses, body parts, organs, tissues, including the waste generated f rom animals used in experiments or testing in veterinary hospitals or colleges or animal houses. Soiled Waste Items contaminated with blood, body fluids like dressings, plaster casts, cotton swabs and bags containing residual or discarded blood and blood components. Discarded or Expired Medicine Pharmaceutical waste like antibiotics, cytotoxic drugs including all items contaminated with cytotoxic drugs along with glass or plastic ampoules, vials etc. Chemical Waste Chemicals used in production of biol ogical and used or discarded disinfectants Chemical Liquid Waste Liquid waste generated due to use of chemicals in production of biological and used or discarded disinfectants, Silver X - ray film developing liquid, discarded Formalin, infected secretions, aspirated body fluids , liquid from laboratories an d floor washings, cleaning, house - keeping and disinfecting activities etc Discarded linen, mattresses, beddings contaminated with blood or body fluid , routine mask & gown . Guidelines for Management of Healthcare Waste as per Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016 4 CATEGORY TYPE OF WASTE Microbiology, Biotechnology and other clinical laboratory waste (Pre -treated) Microbiology, Biotechnology and other clinical laboratory waste: Blood bags, Laboratory cultures, stocks or specimens of microorganisms, live or attenuated vaccines, human and animal cell cul tures used in research, industrial laboratories, production of biological, residual toxins, dishes and devices used for cultures. RED Wastes generated from disposable items such as tubing, bottles, intravenous tubes and sets, catheters, urine bags, syring es without needles , fixed needle syringes with their needles cut , vaccutainers and gloves WHITE Waste Sharps including metals Needles, syringes with fixed needles, needles from needle tip cutter or burner, scalpels, blades, or any other contaminated sharp object that may cause puncture and cuts. This includes both used, discarded and contaminated metal sharps BLUE Broken or discarded and contaminated glass including medicine vials and ampoules except those contaminated with cytotoxic wastes . Body Implants b) General Waste General waste consists of all the waste other than bio -medical waste and which has not been in contact with any hazardous or infectious , chemical or biological secretions and does not includes any waste sharps . This waste consists of mainly : (i) News paper, paper and card boxes (dry waste) (ii) Plastic water bottles (dry waste) (iii) Aluminium cans of soft drinks (dry waste) (iv) Packaging materials (dry waste) (v) Food Containers after emptying residual food (dry waste) (vi) Organic / Bio-degradable waste - mostly food waste (wet waste) (vii) Construction and Demolition wastes These general wastes are further classified as dry wastes and wet wastes and should be collected separately. This quantity of such waste is around 85 % to 90 % of total waste generated from the facility. Such waste is required to be handled as per Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 and Construction & Demolition Waste Management Rules, 2016 , as applicable. c) Other Wastes Other wastes consist of used electronic wastes, used batteries, and radio -active wastes which are not covered under biomedical wastes but have to be disposed as and when such wastes are generated as per the provisions laid down under E -Waste (Management) Rules, 2016 , Batterie s (Management & Handling) Rules , 2001 , and Rules/ guideline s under Atomic Energy Act, 1962 respectively.

While Treatment and Disposal is primarily responsibility of CBWTF operator except for lab and highly infectious waste , which is required to be pre -treated by the HCF . Following are the responsibility of HCF for management and handling of bio -medical waste: 1. Biomedical Waste should be segregated at the point of generation by the person who is generating the waste in designated colour coded bin/ container 2. Biomedical Waste & General Waste shall not be mixed. Biomedical Waste & General Waste shall not be mixed. Storage time of waste should be as less as possible so that waste storage, transportation and disposal is done within 48 hours. 3. Phase out use of chlor inated plastic bags (excluding blood bags) and gloves by 27/3/2019 . 4. No secondary handling or pilferage of waste shall be done at healthcare facility. If CBWTF facility is available at a distance of 75 km from the HCF, bio -medical waste should be treated a nd disposed only through such CBWTF operator. 5. Only Laboratory and Highly infectious waste shall be pre -treated onsite before sending for final treatment or disposal through a CBWTF Operator. 6. Provide bar -code labels on a ll colour coded bags or containers c ontaining segregated bio -medical waste before such waste goes for final disposal through a CBWTF. The management of bio -medical waste can overall be summarized in the following steps ; - Waste Segregation in color coded and barcode labeled bags/ containers at source of generation - Pre-treat Laboratory and Highly infectious waste - Intra-mural transportation of segregated waste to central storage area - Temporary s torage of biomedical waste in central storage area - Treatment and Disposal of biomedical waste through CBWTF or Captive facility 2.2 Bio Medical Waste Segregation Bio- medical waste generated from a healthcare facility is required to be segregated at the point of generation as per the colour coding stipulated under Schedule -I of BMWM Rules, 2016. Following a ctivities to be followed to ensure proper waste segregation: Waste must be segregated at the point of generation of source and not in later stages. As defined earlier too, \"Point of Generation\" means the location where wastes initially genera te, accumulate and is under the control of doctor / nursing staff etc. who is providing treatment to the patient and in the process generating bio -medical waste. Guidelines for Management of Healthcare Waste as per Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016 7 Posters / placards for bio-medical waste segregation should be provided in all the wards as well as in waste storage area . Adequate number of colour coded bins / containers and bags should be available at the point of generation of bio-medical waste. Colour coded plastic bags should be in line with the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016. Specifications for plastic bags and containers given at Annexure 1. Provide Personnel Protective Equipment to the bio -medical waste handling staff . 2.2.1 Color Coding and Type of Container/ Bags to be used for Waste Segregation & Co llection As per Schedule I of the Bio Medical Waste Management Rules, 2016 following colour coding and type of container/bags is needed to be used by the HCFs for segregation and collection of generated Bio Medical Waste from the facility. Table 2: Storage of Biomedical Waste S. No. Category Type of waste Colo ur & Type of Container 1. Yellow Category - Human Anatomical Waste - Animal Anatomical Waste - Soiled Waste - Discarded or Expired Medicine - Microbiology, Biotechnology and other clinical laboratory waste - Chemical Waste (yellow -e) - Chemical Liquid Waste Yellow colo ured non-chlorinated Plastic Bags Note : (i) Chemical w aste (yellow -e) comprising of un-used, residual or date expired liquid chemicals including s pent hypo of X -Ray, should be stored in yellow container 2. Red Category Contaminated Waste (Recyclable) Red Coloured Non Chlorinated Plastic Bags (having thickness equal to more than 50 \u00b5) and Containers Guidelines for Management of Healthcare Waste as per Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016 8 3. White Category Waste Sharps including metals White Coloured translucent, puncture proof, leak proof, Temper Proof containers 4. Blue Category Glassware Metallic Body Implants Puncture proof, leak proof boxes or containers with blue coloured marking 2.3 Bio Medical Waste Collection 2.3.1 Time of Collection Bio-medical waste should be collected on daily basis from each ward of the hospital at a fixed interval of time. There can be multiple collections from wards during the day. HCF should ensure collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of bio -medical waste as per BMW M Rules, 2016 and HCF should also ensure disposal of human anatomical waste, animal anatomical waste, soiled waste and biotechnology waste within 48 hours. Collection times should be fixed and appropriate to the quantity of waste produced in each area of t he health -care facility. General waste should not be collected at the same time or in the same trolley in which bio-medical waste is collected. Collection should be daily for most wastes, with collection timed to match the pattern of waste generation dur ing th e day. For example, in a n IPD ward where the morning Guidelines for Management of Healthcare Waste as per Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016 9 routine begins with the changing of dressings, infectious waste could be collected mid - morning to prevent soiled bandages remaining in the area for longer than necessary. General waste collection, must be done immediately after the visiting hours of the HCFs, as visitors coming to facility generate a lot of general waste and in order to avoid accumulation of such general waste in the HCF. The collection timings must enable the HCF to minimize or nul lify the use of interim storage of waste in the departments. Bio-medical waste collected by the staff, should be provided with PPEs. 2.3.2 Packaging Bio-medical waste bags and sharps containers should be filled to no more than three quarters full. Once this level is reached, they should be sealed ready for collection. Plastic bags should never be stapled but may be tied or sealed with a plastic tag or tie. Replacement bags or containers should be available at each waste -collection location so that full ones can immediately be replaced. Colour coded waste bags and containers should be printed with the bio -hazard symbol, labelled with details such as date, ty pe of waste, waste quantity, senders name and receivers details as well as bar coded label to allow them to be tracked till final disposal. Ensure that Bar coded stickers are pasted on each bag as per the guidelines of CPCB by 27 March , 2019 2.3.3 Labelin g All the bags/ containers/ bins used for collection and storage of bio-medical waste , must be labelled with the Symbol of Bio Hazard or Cytotoxic Hazard as the case may be as per the type of waste in accordance with the BMWM Rules, 2016 . Bio-medical waste bags / containers are required to be provided with bar code labels in accordance with CPCB guidelines for \" Guidelines for barcode System for Effective Management of Biomedical Waste \". Sl No. 000xxxxxxxxxx ALLIN QR Code Bar Code Guidelines for Management of Healthcare Waste as per Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016 10 2.3.4 Interim Storage Interim storage of bio medical waste is discouraged in the wards / different departments of HCF. If waste is needed to be stored on interim basis in the departments it must be stored in the dirty utility/sections. No waste should be stored in patient care area and procedures areas such as Operation Theatre. All infectious waste should be immed iately removed from such areas. In absence of dirty utilities/ sections such BMW must be stored in designated place away from patient and visitor traffic or low traffic area. 2.4 In House Transportation of Bio Medical Waste 2.4.1 Transportation Trolleys In house transportation of Bio Medical Waste from site of waste generation/ interim storage to centra l waste collection centre, with in the premises of the hospital must be done in closed trolleys / containers preferably fitted with wheels for easy manoeuvrability. Such trolleys or carts are designated for the purpose of Bio Medical Waste Collection only. Patient trolleys must not be used for BMW transportation. Size of such waste transport trolleys s hould be as per the volume of waste generated from the HCFs. Bio-Hazard Label Cyto-Toxic Label Typical w aste collection trolley for Red category of BMW Guidelines for Management of Healthcare Waste as per Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016 11 2.4.2 Route of intramural transportation of bio -medical waste Bio-Medical Waste Generated from different wards or laboratories in the Health care facilities must be transported in the covered trolleys/carts through a route which has low traffic flow of patients and visitors. Route of transportation preferably be planned in such a way that: Transportation does not occur through hig h risk areas Supplies and waste are transported through separate routes. Waste is not transported through areas having high traffic of patients and visitors Central Waste collection area can be easy accessed through this route Safe transportation of waste is undertaken to avoid spillage and scattering of waste 2.5 Central Waste Collection Room for Bio -medical Waste Each Healthcare facility should ensure that there is a designated central waste collection room situated within its premises for storage of bio-medical waste, till the waste is picked and transported f or treatment and disposal at CBWTF. Such room should be under the responsibility of a designated person and should be under lock & key. The following points may be considered for construction of central waste collection room: The location of central waste collection room must be away from the public/ visitors access. The space allocation for this room must be as per the quantity of waste generated from the hospital. The planned space must be suf ficient so as to store at least two days generation of waste. Central waste collection room must be roofed and manned and should be under lock and key under the responsibility of designated person. The entrance of this centre must be accessible through a c oncrete ramp for easy transportation of waste collection trolleys. Flooring should be of tiles or any other glazed material with slope so as to ease the cleaning of the area. Exhaust fans should be provided in the waste collection room for ventilation. It is to be ensured by the health care facility that such central storage room is safety inspected for potential fire hazard and based on such inspection preventive measure has to be taken by the health care facility like installation of fire extinguisher, smoke detector etc. There should also be provision for water supply adjacent to central waste storage area for cleaning and washing of this station and the containers. The drainage from the storage and washing area should be routed to the Effluent Treatm ent Plant. Sign boards indicating relevant details such as contact person and the telephone number should be provided. The entrance of this station must be labelled with \" Entry f or Authorized Personal Only \" and Logo of Bio Medical Waste Hazard. It is to be ensured that no general waste is stored in the central waste collection area. Guidelines for Management of Healthcare Waste as per Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016 12 Other Considerations for Central Waste Collection Area To ensure there is no pilferage of recyclables, it is to be ensured that central storage area is under lock & key, guarded by a designated person. Healthcare facilities need to maintain the record of waste generated and handed over to the authorized recyc lers. To ensure protection from the animals, it is to be ensured by the health care facility that there is no stray animal in the health care facility premises and health care facility has installed cattle traps at the entrance of the health care facility. To ensure protection against the pests it is to be ensured by the HCFs that it has engagement of the pest control agency for taking the pest control measures in the central storage area on regular basis. 2.5.1 Central Storage for HCFs Having Captive Treat ment and Disposal System For the health care facilities which are having captive treatment facility for treatment and disposal of biomedical waste through incinerators, autoclaves/microwaves, shredders etc. within its premises must ensure that waste generated from the HCF is stored in this central waste collection area till it is transported to reception area of captive waste treatment facility within the premises. For HCFs having its own treatment and disp osal facility through use of deep burial pits i.e. Primary Health Centres (PHCs) which doesn't fall under coverage area of any CBWTF, interim Storage area used for daily waste collection will serve as Central Waste Collection Area. The collected waste is n eeded to be store in this place before it is disposed of by the deep burial pits as per the specifications given under the BMWM Rules, 2016 . 2.6 Record Keeping 1. Every healthcare facility need to maintain the records w.r.to category wise bio -medical waste generation and its treatment disposal (either by captive facility or through CBWTF) on daily basis . (Please Refer to Annexure 2: Format for Bio Medical Waste Register / Record) 2. Category wise quantity of waste generated from the facility must be recorded in Bio Medical Waste Register /logbook being maintained at central waste collection area under the supervision of one designated person. 3. A weighing machine as per the specifications given in CPCB guidelines for bar code system needs to be kept in central wast e collection centre of the HCF having 30 or more than 30 nos. of beds for weighing the quantity of Bio Medical Waste. 4. HCFs having less than 30 beds shall maintain records of receipts printed by the CBWTF. 5. Records on Annual Report on bio -medical waste management submitted to SPCB/PCC 6. Records w.r.t. Accident Report submitted to SPCB/PCC including \"NILL\" report. 7. Records shall be maintained on training on BMW Management including both Induction and in service training records. Guidelines for Management of Healthcare Waste as per Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016 13 8. Maintain records for Annual Health check -up of all the employees . 9. Maintain record on Immunisation of all the employee s. 10. Records shall be maintained w.r.t. m inutes of meeting of Bio Medical Waste Management committee 11. Records shall be maintained indicating d etails o f accident occurred including preventive and corrective actions taken by the HCFs in relation to such accidents. 12. Records for the operation of the biomedical treatment equipment installed , if any for the treatment of biomedical waste. Please refer Annexure 9 for format of logbook/records maintained for incinerator/plasma pyrolysis and autoclave/hydroclave. 13. Records of testing of Effluent generated from health care facility 14. Record of recyclable waste (plastic/glass) handed over to the authorized recycler in kg/annum. The records related to the handling of BMW by healthcare facilities needs to be retained for a period of five years . 2.7 Updating of Information in Website All bedded healthcare facilit ies as prescribed under BMWM Rules, 2016 shall develop a separate page/web link in its website for displaying the information pertaining to their hospital by 15/03/2020 .

It is also emphasized in the rules that no healthc are facility shall establish on-site treatment and disposal facility for BMW, if a service of CBWTF is available within 75 kilometre of travelling distance of the facility. All the public healthcare facilities within reach of 75 kilometres of CBWTF needs to dispose of the BMW through such CBWTF only and are not allowed to establish its own treatment and disposal facility. For the public health care facilities especially in rural areas where there is no CBWTF within range of 75 kilometres, the disposal of BMW can still be made through a CBWTF who is willing to provide treatment services and authorized by the concerned SPCB/PCC to operate in an area beyond 75 Km radial distance. In case of no reach to any CBWTF , the BMW generated from HCFs should be disposed in captive treatment and dispo sal facility or by deep burial pit as authorised by the respective SPCB/and as specified in these guidelines The collection, treatment, processing and disposal options for both the categories of healthcare facilities; having linkage with CBWTF or not havi ng linkage with C BWTF, are detailed here as per Schedule I of BMW M Rules. 2016 3.1.1 Yellow Category Type of Waste : Yellow (a): Human Anatomical Waste Segregation Human tissues, organs, body parts and fetus below the viability period . This includes , placenta and e xtracted tooth. Type of bag and container Collect the waste in yellow colored non chlorinated plastic bag and store in yellow coloured container Treatment and Disposal: For HCF having linkage with CBWTF No treatment of waste is required to be carried out at the health care facility except pre-treatment (sterilization) of Yellow (h) category waste by autoclaving/ microwaving/ hydroclaving or sterilize as per methods prescribed in WHO Blue book 2014 . Yellow category waste along with pre -treated waste should be stored in central storage point and must be handed over to CBWTF. It is mandatory for each health care facility that dead fetus waste should be handed over to CBWTF in yellow bag with a copy of t he Guidelines for Management of Healthcare Waste as per Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016 15 official Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) certificate from the Obstetrician or the Medical Superintendent/ SMO/ CMO of the HCF . For HCF without linkage to CBWTF This waste should be disposed through Plasma Pyrolysis unit or twin chambered compact incinerator with 2 seconds retention time in secondary combustion chamber and adequate air pollution control devices to comply with revised emission norms prescribed under BMW Management Rules, 2016 . Disposal of the waste in the deep burial pit should n ot be practiced unless the hospitals is located in rural or remote isolated place. Use of deep burial pit should be as authorised by the respective SPCB/PCC. Copy of official MTP certificate from the MO I/C for fetus below the vitality period must be kept with the HCF.

An intimation in this regard shall be provided to concerned SPCBs. 3.2 Spill Management Procedures: Healthcare Facilities have to ensure environmentally sound management of mercury or other chemical spills. In case of mercury spill, the following steps as given in CPCB guidelines on \"Environmentally Sound Techniques f or Mercury Waste Generated from Healthcare Facilities\" shall be followed; (i) Evacuate area: As far as possible, keep people who are not involved in the cleanup away from spill area to limit exposures and to prevent the spread of contamination. (ii) Put on face ma sk: In order to prevent breathing of mercury vapour, wear a protective face mask. (iii) Remove jewelry so that the mercury cannot combine (amalgamate) with the precious metals. (iv) Put on rubber or latex gloves. If there are any broken pieces of glass or sharp objec ts, pick them up with care. Place all broken objects on a paper towel, fold the paper towel and place in a puncture proof yellow bag or container. Secure the plastic bag/container and label it as items contaminated with mercury. (v) Locate all mercury beads a nd look for mercury in any surface cracks or in hard -to- reach areas of the floor. Check a wide area beyond the spill. Use the flashlight to Guidelines for Management of Healthcare Waste as per Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016 24 locate additional glistening beads of mercury that may be sticking to the surface or in small cracked areas. Cardboa rd sheets may be 'used to push the spilled beads of mercury together'. (vi) A syringe (without a needle) shall be used to suck the beads of mercury. Collected mercury should be placed slowly and carefully into an unbreakable plastic container/glass bottle with an airtight lid half filled with water. After removing larger beads, us e sticky tape to collect smaller hard -to-see beads. Place the sticky tape in a punctured proof yellow bag and secure properly. Commercially available powdered sulfur or zinc stains mercury a darker colour and can make smaller beads easier to see (powder su lfer may be used because (i) it makes the mercury easier to see since there may be a color change from yellow to brown and (ii) it binds the mercury so that it can be easily removed and suppresses the vapourization of any missing mercury). (vii) Place all the m aterials used during the cleanup, including gloves, mercury spills collected from the spill area into a yellow plastic bag or container with lid and sealed properly and labeled as mercury containing waste. (viii) Sprinkle sulphur or zinc powder over the area. Ei ther powder will quickly bind any remaining mercury. In case, zinc powder is used, moisten the powder with water after it is sprinkled and use a paper towel to rub it into cracks in the flooring. Use the cardboard and then dampened paper towels to pick up the powder and bound mercury. Place all towels and cardboard in a yellow plastic bag and seal all the bags that were used and store in a designated area. All the mercury spill surfaces should be decontaminated with 10 % sodium thiosulfate solution. Keep a window open to ventilate after the cleanup. After ensuring all the mercury has been removed, resume normal vacuuming and utilize the cleaned area for routine operation. (ix) All the bags or containers containing items contaminated with mercury should be marked properly and labeled as waste mercury containing. This waste shall be categorized as yellow -e chemical waste and shall be disposed as per the options given in flowchart ( Figure 3). Guidelines for Management of Healthcare Waste as per Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016 25 Figure 3 : Flow chart showing management of mercury spills Other chemical spills should be absorbed in suitable absorption media such as dry sand, proprietary booms, absorbent pads etc. and collected separately.

It must be ensured that animals do not have any access to burial sites. Covers of galvanized iron or wire meshes may be used. On each occasion, when wastes are added to the pit, a layer of 10 cm of soil shall be added to cover the wastes. Burial must be performed under close and dedicated supervision. The deep burial site should be relatively impermeable and no shallow well should be close to the site. Guidelines for Management of Healthcare Waste as per Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016 32 The pits should be distant from habitation, and located so as to ensure that no contamination occurs to surface water or ground water. The area should not be prone to flooding or erosion. The location of the deep burial site shall be authorized by the prescribed authority i.e CPCB/ SPCB or District Pollution Control Board Office. The institution shall maintain a record of all pits used for deep burial. The ground water table level should be a minimum of six meters below the lower level of deep burial pit. 3.5 Suggested method for design of concrete pit for waste sharps . If required , a sharp pit must be constructed within the hospital premise to dispose of the sharp waste generated from the facility. Prior to disposal in concrete pit, sharps w aste should be disinfected and treated in following methods; - Autoclaving along with sharp containers followed by shredding or mutilation; or - Combination of shredding cum autoclaving along with sharp containers - Sharp pit must be a 1m \u00d71m\u00d71m concrete lined circular or rectangular pit as shown in figure 4. - Pit can be dug and lined with brick, masonry or concrete rings. - The pit should be covered with a heavy concrete slab, in which a galvanized steel pipe of about 1.0m height and suitable diameter is fixed to feed the shredded or mutilated sharps waste. - The top opening of the steel pipe shall have a provision of locking after the treated waste sharps has been disposed in. - Once the pit filled up to 3/4th capacity, it can be encapsulation with binding material like cement. Once encapsulated mass is dry, sharp pit is sealed and another sharp pit is created for further use. Guidelines for Management of Healthcare Waste as per Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016 33 - For high water table regions where water table is less than 6m beneath bottom of the pit, a tank with above mentioned arrangements shall be made above the ground.
