JMIR Res Protoc ; 10(1): e25351, [cognitive are costly, challenging to treat, prevalent among older [adults], and worsen each other over [time]. We are iteratively developing Active Brains-Fitbit (AB-F), a live video program for older [adults]with CP and CD that teaches mind-body skills and gradual increases in step count. AB-F has demonstrated feasibility; acceptability; and signs of improvement in emotional, physical, and [cognitive functions]when delivered in [person]to older [adults]. OBJECTIVE:We are conducting feasibility [randomized controlled trial](RCT) of versus a [time]- and [health]enhancement program [HEP]) in older [adults]with CP and CD. Here, we describe virtual adaptions to our study protocol, manualized [treatments], evaluation plan, and study design in response to [feedback]from former participants and COVID-19. We [will]evaluate the feasibility [benchmarks]and the potential of AB-F to improve physical, emotional, and [cognitive functions]. METHODS:This is [pain clinic] [referrals], institutional [registries], and flyers. Interested participants are screened for eligibility via [telephone]and provide [electronic] [informed consent]. After [randomization], participants are study including their [treatment]manual, an ActiGraph accelerometer, and a Fitbit (separate envelope for AB-F only). Both conditions are manualized and delivered over 8 weekly sessions via Zoom. Participants complete self-report and performance-based ( [6-min walk test]and Montreal Cognitive Assessment) [outcome measures]via Zoom at baseline and post intervention. Primary outcomes are a priori set feasibility (recruitment, quantitative [measures], and adherence), acceptability, credibility, expectancy, and [satisfaction] [benchmarks]. [Secondary]outcomes are physical, cognitive, and emotional functions as well as intervention targets (social function, [pain intensity], [pain]-specific coping, and [mindfulness]). RESULTS:The trial is ongoing. We have recruited 21 participants (10 AB-F and 11 HEP) across 2 rounds. Only 2 participants have withdrawn (1 before baseline and 1 before the first session). All 19 remaining participants have completed the baseline assessment. In the first round, attendance is high (11 out of 12 participants completed all 4 sessions so far), and AB-F participants are adherent to their Fitbit and step [goals](5 out of 6 participants). CONCLUSIONS:Preliminary findings are promising for the feasibility of our completely virtual AB-F intervention. However, these findings need to be confirmed at the trial conclusion. This study [will]answer important questions about the feasibility of delivering a completely virtual mind-body activity program to older [adults]with comorbid CP and CD, which, to our [knowledge], is unprecedented. Details on integrating multiple digital platforms for virtual assessments and intervention delivery [will]inform [treatment]development for older [adults]and those with comorbid CP and CD, which is crucial during the COVID-19 pandemic.
